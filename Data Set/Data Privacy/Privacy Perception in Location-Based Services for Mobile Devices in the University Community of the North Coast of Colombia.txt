 Abstract  
Introduction:  The use of mobile applications has 
increased in the last years. Most of them require 
the knowledge of the user location, either for 
their core service or for marketing purposes. 
Location -based services (LBS) offer context -
based assistance to users based o n their location. 
Although these applications ask the user for 
permission to use their location and even 
explain in detail how this information will be 
used in its terms and conditions, most users are 
not aware or even interested in the fact that their 
location information is stored in databases and 
monetized by selling it to third -party companies. 
Regarding this situation, we developed a study 
with the aim to assess perception, concerns and 
awareness from users about their location 
information. Methods:  This work is based on an 
exploratory survey applied to the university 
community, mainly from the North Coast of 
Colombia, to measure the perception of location 
privacy of users with mobile devices. The 
questionnaire was applied using Google Forms. 
The sur vey has nineteen questions organized in 
three sections: personal information, 
identification of privacy and privacy 
management. These questions were designed to 
know the users ’ perceptions of privacy concerns 
in LBS and any actions they take to preserve it . 
Results:  The results show that, in general, the 
respondents do not have a real concern 
regarding the privacy of their geolocation data, 
and the majority is not willing to pay to protect 
their privacy. Conclusions:  This type of surveys 
can generate awaren ess among participants 
about the use of their private information. The 
results expose in this paper can be used to create 
government policies and regulations by 
technology companies about the privacy 
management .

Introducción:  El uso de aplicaciones móviles 
se ha incrementado en los últimos años. La 
mayoría de ellas requiere conocer la ubicación 
del usuario, ya sea para su servicio principal o 
para fines de marketing. Los servicios basados 
en localización (SBL) ofrecen asistenc ia 
contextual para los usuarios según su 
ubicación. Aunque estas aplicaciones le piden 
permiso al usuario para usar su ubicación e 
incluso explican en detalle cómo se usará esta 
información en sus términos y condiciones, la 
mayoría de los usuarios no están  conscientes 
ni incluso interesados en el hecho de que la 
información de su ubicación se almacene en 
bases de datos y se monetice, vendiéndolo a 
terceros. Con respecto a esta situación, 
desarrollamos un estudio con el objetivo de 
evaluar la percepción, las  preocupaciones y el 
conocimiento de los usuarios sobre la 
información de su ubicación. Métodos:  este 
trabajo se basa en una encuesta exploratoria 
aplicada a la comunidad universitaria, 
principalmente de la costa norte de Colombia, 
para medir la percepción  de la privacidad de 
ubicación de los usuarios con dispositivos 
móviles. El cuestionario se aplicó utilizando 
los formularios de Google. La encuesta tiene 
diecinueve preguntas organizadas en tres 
secciones: información personal, identificación 
de privacida d y gestión de la privacidad. Estas 
preguntas fueron diseñadas para conocer las 
percepciones de los usuarios sobre las 
preocupaciones de privacidad en SBL y 
cualquier acción que tomen para preservarla. 
Resultados:  los resultados muestran que, en 
general, l os encuestados no tienen una 
preocupación real con respecto a la privacidad 
de sus datos de geolocalización, y la mayoría 
no está dispuesta a pagar para proteger su 
privacidad. Conclusiones:  este tipo de 
encuestas puede generar conciencia entre los 
partici pantes sobre el uso de su información 
privada. Los resultados expuestos en este 
documento se pueden utilizar para crear 
políticas y regulaciones gubernamentales por 
parte de las compañías de tecnología sobre la 
administración de la privacidad.

 Introduction  
 
Mobile technologies have increased recently and along with them, the flow of information. 
The access to knowledge and use of these data concerns many users. It has opened the 
debate about what kind of data should be public or private. In the study presente d in [1], 
when Americans are asked what comes to mind when they hear the word “privacy,” they 
give important weight to the idea that privacy applies to their “rights”. According to this 
study, the item details of physical location over time  is fifth out of  sixteen on the level of 
sensitivity of personal information. Location -based information systems (LBISs) are 
defined as “applications that provide users with information based on their geographical 
position, which could be obtained from the mobile device t hey are accessing the service, or 
using a manually defined location” [2]. For LBSs to provide the requested information 
properly, sensitive data about the subject’s location is required [3]. Location information 
privacy is an important topic in the context  of expanding mobile technologies and 
applications.  
 
The perception of privacy is a subjective concept that has changed with the advance in 
technology; for instance, from mail to e -mail or from telephones to cellphones. This variety 
of concepts hinders it s measurement and the setting of privacy options in the mobile 
applications that use LBS, so it is more suitable to have a multidimensional concept of 
privacy. For example, in [4], the authors distinguish four dimensions of privacy and 
defining it as ‘‘the  ability to control and limit physical, interactional, psychological and 
informational access to the self or one’s group’’. Likewise, the work in [5] defines privacy 
“as the claim of individuals, groups or institutions to determine for themselves when, how , 
and what information about them is communicated to others”, while in [6], “the privacy 
involves the policies, procedures, and other controls that determine which personal 
information is collected, how it is used, with whom it is shared, and how individua ls who 
are the subject of that information are informed and involved in this process”.  
 
The concept of privacy and its implications is of vital importance, and for this reason, the 
UN Human Rights Council defends the right to privacy in the digital age an d recognizes the 
global and open nature of the Internet and the rapid advancement in information and 
communication technologies as a driving force in accelerating progress towards 
development in its various forms. It also affirms that the same rights that people have 
offline must also be protected online, including the right to privacy [7]. In addition to these 
definitions, location awareness involves privacy issues that differ from others. For example, 
when users download some mobile applications, they are  not aware that they are also 
giving the application permission for this information (usually because the majority of user Privacy Perception in Location -Based Services for Mobile Devices in the University Community of the North Coast of Colombia  
 
INGENIERÍA Y UNIVERSIDAD: ENGINEERING FO R DEVELOPMENT | COLOMBIA | V. 23 | NO. 1 | 2019  | ISSN: 0123 -2126 /2011 -2769 (Online) | Pág. 4 
 do not read the terms and conditions). On the other hand, users are concerned with whether 
their location is stored and whether this information is sold to third parties, but they are 
willing to sacrifice their information in order to have access to the service.  
 
In a previous study, privacy has been evaluated in different contexts: management of data 
in the Internet [8], email, phone c onversations and clinical history. However, to the best of 
the knowledge of the authors, there has not been a previous study that measures privacy 
perception in location -based services in Colombia. This work tries to cover two dimensions 
for privacy in LBS : privacy awareness and privacy management. The results analyzed from 
the survey offer a general view on the areas of privacy in location, and useful insights to 
understand the user preferences. The main percentage of the surveyed population is the 
univers ity communities in the North Caribbean region, with a small number of participants 
from other communities.  
 
Related Work  
 
New modes of communication have created many concerns about user security and 
privacy: identity, location, routine, and opinions are m ostly public information via social 
networks. The question of “who knows this information” has arisen within mobile 
technologies. This is a real concern because there are reported cases where a government 
used LBIS to determine political views of individua ls based on the presence of keywords or 
expressions against official positions, turning these people into targets of exhaustive 
tracking. However, this is not the only risk. In [9], the authors also include other risks:  
 
 Being tracked by an operator to det ermine where a particular user's phone is 
located.  
 Listing all devices that are deployed in a certain area at a certain time.  
 Wi-Fi and Bluetooth tracking through the MAC address of the mobile device, even 
if this is not actively connected to a network.  
 Illegal malware installed on mobile devices that track the user's location and their 
conversations.  
 
The above risks have also been analyzed in a study by [10] at MIT, where it was 
demonstrated that in a dataset of 1 ,5 million people where the location of an  individual is 
specified hourly and with a spatial resolution equal to that given by the carrier's antennas, 
only four space -temporal points are required to uniquely identify 95  % of the individuals.  Privacy Perception in Location -Based Services for Mobile Devices in the University Community of the North Coast of Colombia

Privacy in other context has been analyzed by many other studies. For example, the work 
done by [11] proposes a categorization of factors that should be included when examining 
Internet user’s privacy perception. The results of the performed analyses indicate that 
respondents who were more concerned about information collected during their online 
activity were also more concerned about their online privacy. In addition, respondents with 
a higher level of dissatisfaction with the current privacy protection reported a higher level 
of online privacy concerns.  
 
Furthermore, other recent studies show that users are becoming more aware of the security 
risks associated with their location, finding that 19  % of cellphone owners have turned off 
the location tracking feature on their devices because they were concerne d that other 
individuals or companies could access that information [12].  
 
Regarding location privacy, some techniques based on obfuscation have been developed. In 
[3], the authors present a compendium of techniques to protect the location privacy of the 
users. In [13], the authors propose an approach based on entity resolution which enables 
users to disclose their mobility information without compromising their privacy, even the 
data are linked with external publicly available information (social networks) . In this field 
of study, there are other proposed methods to conceal the location of a user [14] [15] [16] 
[17].  
 
There are few existing studies regarding privacy perception surveys. in [18], results show 
that users have a variety of motivations for part icipating in location -based surveys and that 
these motivations depend on the type of the survey in question. This study concluded that 
users concerned with privacy are less likely to be motivated by a monetary benefit but by 
the importance of the topic and  that the intrinsic motivators that drive the users concerned 
with privacy differ from those that drive unconcerned users.  
 
In 2011, the National Institute of Information Technologies (INTECO) of Spain developed 
a series of investigations supporting privac y with mobile devices [19]. T he purpose of the 
study was to “ perform a diagnostic of the use that the evolutionary netizens made in the 
mobile devices and smartphones, as well as the safety measures used and the impact 
suffered". Other study based on perce ption was developed by the University of Madeira, 
using the basis of location from social networks. It stated “that location is an idiosyncratic 
property of people’s social networking profiles, and sharing it does not conform to existing Privacy Perception in Location -Based Services for Mobile Devices in the University Community of the North Coast of Colombia

 social network pra ctices and norms, particularly when the sharing is done in real -time and 
through mobile devices that the user permanently carries around” [20].  
 
In Colombia, the Groupe Speciale Mobile As sociation (GSMA) published the “ Study of 
GSMA on attitudes related t o the privacy of the mobile users” [21], The aim was to 
understand the privacy concerns that users of mobile device have and to help the 
development of public policies. Although data management involves the concept of 
privacy, there are not many studies ab out this topic, especially regarding LBS. This work is 
a first step to evaluate privacy perception in LBS in Colombia, as mentioned in the 
introduction.  
 
Methodology  
 
This study is based on an exploratory survey to measure the perception of location priva cy 
of users with mobile devices. The questionnaire was applied using Google Forms, an 
application that is a part of the Google Drive suite, in which basic surveys can be designed 
and distributed electronically. We, with the help of external experts, used cons ensus 
techniques [22] and indications to generate and select the questions as it is suggested in 
[23]. Finally, the form of the survey instrument was designed to identify the perceptions of 
privacy concerns in LBS.  
 
The link to the form was distributed by  the academic programs in participating universities 
to all the enrolled students and faculty. In addition, other mechanisms, such as social 
networks and email mailing lists were used in order to increase the outreach of the survey. 
Once all the answers we re received, a filtering process was performed in order to eliminate 
incomplete or corrupt information. Next, the final dataset was used for statistical analysis: 
the qualitative variables were used as categorical variables to perform multiple 
correspon dence analysis (see  Results section ) and several descriptive graphics were used 
to interpret the results  
 
Materials  
 
The survey has nineteen questions organized in three sections: personal information, 
identification of privacy and privacy management. These questions were designed to know 
the users’ perceptions of privacy concerns in LBS and any actions they take to pres erve it. Privacy Perception in Location -Based Services for Mobile Devices in the University Community of the North Coast of Colombia

 The criteria used by the authors to generate the questions were determined by the following 
suggestions given by [23]:  
 
 Questions should be clear, simple, short and motivating.  
 To avoid ambiguities, the questions should include a single logical st atement.  
 The questions should be grouped by subject.  
 
The responses for the multiple choice questions were selected by consensus with the 
purpose of trying to cover the most important possibilities and according to other similar 
studies such as [24], [25].  
 
For the demographic and socioeconomic data categories, the following variables were 
included: age, gender, city of residence, level of study, economic sector and monthly 
income.  
 
In the categories of privacy awareness about location, the questions were made to ascertain 
the level of knowledge that the users of mobile devices have about the privacy of their 
location. The following questions were asked:  
 
1. Do you know if you have applications on your mobile phone that have access to 
your geographical locati on? (Options: Yes/No)  
2. How do you rate the fact that applications on your mobile can know and store your 
geographical location with or without your consent? (Options: scale 1 -bad, 5 -
Good)  
3. Which entities would you allow to have access to your geographical location? 
(Options, multiple responses: Relatives and friends, Advertising and marketing 
companies, Social networks, Coworkers, Financial Institutions or Insurers, 
Government, Telecommunica tions companies and None)  
4. Do you use on your mobile device applications that store your geographical 
location or that of your family? (Options: Yes/No)  
5. Do you know if a relative or a friend has had an incident in security or privacy 
associated with the kn owledge of the geographical location by third parties? 
(Options: Yes/No)  Privacy Perception in Location -Based Services for Mobile Devices in the University Community of the North Coast of Colombia

 6. Do you agree with creating laws that protect the location of people? (Options: 
Yes/No)  
7. Would you be willing to pay to protect access to your location? (Options: Yes/No)  
8. What is the re ason you share your location? (Options, multiple responses: Safety, 
Work. Business and Other)  
 
Finally, the last category presented questions to analyze the level of supervision and control 
of the users on the management of the privacy of their location. T he questions asked are as 
follows:  
 
1. Which of the following situations do you consider an invasion of the privacy of your 
location? (Options, multiple responses: Selling my location data to third parties, 
Give my location to use an App, Sending advertising using my location and not 
being informed about using my location.)  
2. How often would you prefer Apps to ask you about access to your location? 
(Options: Every time you use the application, only when you install the application 
and do not ask about permission  to access your location.)  
3. Which of the following cases do you think the location could be accessed without 
the user ’s permission? (Options, multiple responses: Know the location of your 
children, Know the location of your employees, In case of emergency, Sending 
advertising targeting your interests, Never and Other)  
 
Participants  
 
The survey was sent to a total of 5800 people, of whom 670 responded, a response rate of 
11,5 %. Responses were analyzed, cleaned and standardized in terms of age and city origin, 
because these questions were open -ended.  
 
The mean age of the sample was 23 years, and the range was 13 -63. The majority of the 
respondents could be classified as young adults. The respondents were from Colombia, 
especially from the Colombian Carib bean Region. In addition, 50 ,1 % of the population 
surveyed had a professional career, and 64 ,9 % were students.

 Results  
 
In the survey, all the questions were the same and mandatory. However if the response to 
the question about occupation was “ work ”, then the respondent was redirected to the 
section “ economic area ”, which had 2 questions about salary and about specific area.  
 
After the answers were submitted, a cleaning process was performed, removing unrelated 
and inappropriate responses. Then, each q uestion was entered into the statistical analysis 
software IBM -SPSS. Closed responses and multiple choice questions were quantified by 
assigning a value for the label.  
 
According to the kind of question (privacy awareness or privacy management), two 
diffe rent analyses were performed: a discriminant analysis for nominal variables, as in the 
case of privacy awareness [26], and for the section privacy management, a cross -tabulation 
analysis was performed for each variable.  
 
Demographic and Socioeconomic Data 
 
As mentioned in the Methodology section, the survey was conducted among 670 
participants, of whom 59 ,6 % were male and 40 ,4 % female. Most participants were in the 
age range of 18 to 25 years old, 66 ,62 %, followed by the age range of 26 to 40, 17 ,29 %. 
These ages coincided with the answers given for the activities reported by  the participants, 
as shown in f igures 1 and 3.

Respondents’ Privacy Awareness  
 
This section describes the percentage of respondents who know about apps that use their 
location. It considers the respondents reported age, gender, education level and occupation. 
Statistical tests are conducted to determine whether any differences observ ed are 
statistically significant.  
 
Do you Know if you Have Applications on your Cellphone that Have Access to your Geographical 
Location?  
 
The majority of respondents (92 ,54 %) stated that they know about apps that have ac cess to 
their geolocation (see f igure 7a). This behavior was common in all cases (age, gender, 
education level and occupation). A first discriminant analysis showed that the relationship 
between this question and age, education level and occupation of respondent was not 
statistically sig nificant. Nevertheless, gender has a p -value  < 0,05 in the test of equal means 
of groups. Then, a second analysis was performed, comparing the gender with the other 
variables.  
 
In the case of gender and age range, it can be seen that the knowledge about location 
differed on the predictor variable gender. This result was obtained using ANOVA. A single 
discriminant function was calculated. The value of this function was significantly different 
for knowledge and nonknowledge (χ^2  = 8,740, df  = 2, p-value  < 0,05). The correlations 
between the predictor variables and the discriminant function suggested that gender was the 
best predictor for this question, since gender was positively correlated with discriminant 
function value. This means that gender can affect the answer to this question.

Would you Be Willing to Pay to Protect Access to your Location?  
 
The majority of respondents (67 ,61 %) stated that they would not pay to protect  access to 
their location (see f igure 7b). This behavior was common in all cases (age, gender, 
education level and occupation). A discriminant analysis showed that the relationship 
between this question and gender,  age, education level and occupation of respondents was 
not statistically significant.  
 
Other Questions Related with Privacy Awareness  
 
The respondents were also questioned about the entities that could have access to their 
location, and the majority (83 ,3 %) agreed that family members could access the 
geolocation. Regarding the reason to share the location, 75 ,2 % of respondents selected to 
be in touch with relatives , of which 49  % selected for safety . In f igure 8, the respondents 
rated the access to the l ocation of the mobile applications, being 1 -bad and 5 -good.

Taking into account these results, the main reasons for respondents to share their location is 
to keep in touch with relatives or safety reasons. Additionally, more than a third of them 
have an indifferent position regarding other entities having access to their location, and a 
third of the surveyed individuals consider that it tends to be bad.  
 
Respondents Privacy Management  
 
This section describes the percentage of respondents who would take action facing the 
privacy management. It considers the respondents’ reported age, gender, education level 
and occupation. A cross -tabulation is created in order to analyze the relationship  between 
the independent variables and the response options.  
 
Respondents were split into four groups of their reported age (18 years or younger; 19 -25 
years; 26 -40 years; 40 years or older), corresponding to levels 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.

 Which of the Following Situations do you Consider an Invasion of the Privacy of your Location?  
 
In this question, the respondents had four options for responses available: 1) Selling my 
location data to third parties, 2) Give my location to use an App, 3) Sending advertising 
using my location and 4) Not being informed about using my location.  
 
In figure 9, it can be seen that the majority of respondents consider an invasion of the 
privacy in location selling the location data to third parties  and a large percentage (66 ,3 %) 
also consider not being informed about using the location  an invasion.

A crosstabulation was performed for each independent variable (age, gender, education 
level and occupation). Fig ure 10 shows the analysis between the age range and the four 
options of the question. Figures 11, 12 and 13 show the crosstabulation between the four 
options of the question and gender, education level and occupation, respectively.  
 
In this case, the majorit y of respondents in the group comprising 19 -25 years, male gender, 
bachelors and students considered an invasion of the privacy in the categories of selling the 
location data to third parties  and not being informed about using the location . This shows 
that not knowing what using the location information may be a concern for the user.

Which of the Following Cases do you Think the Location could Be Accessed without the User’s 
Permission?  
 
In this question, the respondents had five options, with multiple responses available: 1) 
know the location of your children, 2) know the location of your employees, 3) in cas e of 
emergency, 4) sending advertising targeting your interests, 5) never and 6) other.  
 
The f igure 14 shows that the majority of respondents consider that the location could be 
accessed without permission in case of emergency (76 ,6 %) and the 56 ,1 % consider they 
can access to the location of their children, even without their permission.

the aim to compare their results in different regions of Colombia. Fig ure 15 sho ws the 
analysis between the age range and the five options of the question. Figures 16, 17 and 18 
show the analyses between the five options of the question and gender, education level and 
occupation, respectively. Option 6) Other was omitted in the graphi cs because of the low

According to the comp arative analysis by regions in f igure 19, it may be observed that the 
percentage of respondents who agree to access the location without the user's permission in 
cases of emergency and to know the location of their children  does not vary according to 
the region. In all cases, it tends to rema in constant with 56  % for the Caribbean cities and 
62 % for the rest of the country.  
 
We can state that the concerns about the privacy of the location data are the same across the 
country and are not affected by the region of origin of the respondents. The above is also 
evident in the disapproval of the persons to whom its location can be known by the 
employers , a response that gets a very low percentage of acceptance: 5  % in the Caribbean 
region and of 8 ,5 % on average for the rest of the country. Nevertheless, it is important to 
highlight that the size of the sample in regions that do not belong to the Caribbean coast is 
very low; thus, it is desirable in future studies to expand the sample of those regions in 
order to get better conclusions.

 Multiple Correspondence Analysis  
 
A multiple correspondence analysis was performed to discern the attributes of the groups 
that are formed when matching the qualitative variables, discerning each one of the 
dimensions. All the variables were coded according to the definition in Results section, but 
the variable Occupation  (In what occupies your time ) was summarized in three categories: 
1) work, 2) studies and 3) leisure . The results are presented in f igure 20, where dimension 1 
is the variable Age and dimension 9 is the variable payment for protection in location :

According to f igure 20, the group “young students or just graduated nonsalaried”, which 
corresponds to the groups adolescents and young adults, mostly students (age range: 1 
under 18 years and 2, 19 to 25 years), or young just graduates who do not yet earn salaries, 
regardle ss of gender, disapprove the use of their location with or without their consent. This 
may be mainly because they know about technology and have some degree of knowledge 
about the use that the telecommunications companies can give to this information. In t his 
group, there are a greater correspondence in levels 2 of “Gender ”, level 1 of the variable

INGENIERÍA Y UNIVERSIDAD: ENGINEERING FO R DEVELOPMENT | COLOMBIA | V. 23 | NO. 1 | 2019  | ISSN: 0123 -2126 /2011 -2769 (Online) | Pág. 24 
 “According to others use your location ” and level 1 of the variable “Pay to protect your 
location ”, which indicates that within this group, the men disapprove ev en more the use 
consented or not of its location, reason why even they would be willing to pay to protect 
this information.  
 
On the other hand, women in this group tend to not to pay for the protection of their 
location, and in fact they are more inclined  to use geo -localized applications than men. The 
line is used to visualize the aforementioned situation of disparity in preferences between 
men and women in this group.  
 
The group “Employees adults rank 3 who have leisure time and potentially unfamiliar w ith 
technology ” shows the opposite correspondence to the previous group. In this case, the 
people in the age range of 26 to 40 years who have a job that provides a good income and 
have sufficient leisure time mostly approve the use of their location with o r without their 
consent. This may be because they are people who do not have a good knowledge of 
technology and use it only to supply their needs in telecommunications.  
 
A third group, “Postgraduate Professionals from Different Employment Sectors ” is 
obser ved, which shows the correspondence of adults over 40 with a high level of education 
(Specialization, M.Sc. and Ph.D.), regardless of their work sector. In this case, there is not a 
well-defined correspondence related to the aspects of use of its location through its mobile 
phones. Furthermore, they are a potential group that would not bother sharing their location 
or give others access to it without their consent.  
 
There is a remnant group, “Low income with no leisure time ”, which shows that low -
income peo ple, in general terms, spend all their time at work, so they may not be related to 
the use of geo -localized applications (because their salary level does not allow it or because 
they are not inclined to use them) resulting in that they are not clearly incl ined by the 
approval or disapproval of the use co nsented or not of its location.  
 
Conclusions  
 
In this study, a survey was applied to assess how citizens from Colombia perceive privacy 
in LBS for mobile device users. A total of 670 answers were used in the analysis from 690 
original answers, after the filtering process. It is worth noting the demogr aphics of the 
respondents; the majority of them were university students because the contacted Privacy Perception in Location -Based Services for Mobile Devices in the University Community of the North Coast of Colombia  
 
INGENIERÍA Y UNIVERSIDAD: ENGINEERING FO R DEVELOPMENT | COLOMBIA | V. 23 | NO. 1 | 2019  | ISSN: 0123 -2126 /2011 -2769 (Online) | Pág. 25 
 population was several universities of Barranquilla, Santa Marta and Monteria, mainly. 
This can bias the results, but the questions and the methodology can be ap plied to the whole 
country, which would build a more assorted sample.  
 
Regarding the results, it can be stated that, in general, the respondents did not show a real 
concern about the privacy in their geo -location and the majority is not willing to pay to 
protect this privacy. However, they consider it an invasion to their geo -location privacy if 
location data is sold to third parties or if they are not informed about using the location. 
They agree with allowing access the location without permission in ord er to know the 
location of their children and in case of emergency.  
 
Furthermore, with the multiple correspondence analysis we find that mobile device users 
who would be willing to pay to protect their privacy are young men in the age range of 18 
to 25 yea rs, who also disapprove the use of their location information without consent.  
 
Responding to this type of surveys can generate awareness among participants about the 
use of their private information. In addition, these results can be used to create gover nment 
policies and regulations by technology companies about the privacy management.  
 
Finally, it is worth mentioning that Google Forms  facilitated the assessment of data, taking 
into account that the participants were not geographically located in the sam e area. 
Additionally, it was necessary to limit the number of questions in order to ensure that the 
motivation level of respondents was kept high and to avoid poor data quality [28]. The 
survey did not ask the identity of the respondent, ensuring anonymity  of the respondents.  
 
For future work, a new survey should be applied to a larger and more diverse population in 
order to capture not only university -related citizens but also other communities that may 
have different needs from their LBS. Additionally, it  could show the impact of the number 
of increasing scandals related to privacy in social networks, such as the ones about 
Facebook and the elections in the United States. In addition, the survey may evaluate the 
perception of the citizens about strategies to save the privacy in LBS for mobile device 
users.
