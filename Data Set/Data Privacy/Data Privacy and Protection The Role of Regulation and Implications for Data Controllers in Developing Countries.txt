Abstract. Advances in new technologies present challenges to general expecta-
tions relating to collection, usage and cross -border control and transfer of per-
sonal data  in recent times. Data has become the critical component of the fourth 
industrial revolution in global economies involving governments, businesses, and 
individuals. This paper considers the recent introduction of Data Protection Reg-
ulation in Nigeria (NDPR ), which can be adjudged to have novel compliance 
structures globally. Using a qualitative approach, and further enabled by the in-
stitutional theory as a framework the paper examines the implications of the 
NDPR requirements for Data Controllers and Proces sors in key sectors of the 
economy. Findings from the study shows that there are five key components of 
the NDPR that can compel, motivate or support organizations to make significant 
structural changes such as standardization of processes, practices and I T assets to 
show conformity and/or gain legitimacy. The study equally identified  the factors 
that facilitate or inhibit the adoption and implementation of the conditions of the 
NDPR categorised in line with the three pillars of the institutional theory fra me-
work . These findings projects policy direction in enhancing the institutionalisa-
tion of NDPR measures across key sectors.  It will also inform businesses on nec-
essary cause of action and changes to ensure privacy and protection of personal 
data collected from data subjects.

1 Introduction  
Globalisation and phenomenal growth of Internet and Web access are complicating the 
challen ges of personal data privacy and protection around the world. Vulnerabilities 
due to data collection in both public and private sectors are at a potentially remarkable 
stage. For instance, governments collect and process personal information from popu-
lation census, birth certificate, voters register, and drivers’ license records. On the other 2 
hand, private corporations such as telecommunications operators, fund managers, and 
commercial banks increasingly build capacities for compiling databases of customer 
information aided by unlimited capability of new technologies with  ease of tracking 
and retrieval . 
With globalization and rapid technological advancements, there is obviously in-
creased capability for organizations or businesses to collect, analyse, store, transfer and 
interlink data for various purposes including direct marketing and personalized services 
[1]. In this regard, with identification technologies in the form of radio -frequency iden-
tification (RFID) and social media platforms such as Facebook, In stagram and other 
networks, data privacy and protection are currently being challenged [2].  
In Europe and North America, developments in personal data processing technolo-
gies evolved with data privacy legislation and several other initiatives to improve t he 
level of privacy protection. The first data privacy act by German Federal State of Hes-
sen dated back to 1970 and was followed by the adoption of Swedish Data Protection 
act in 1973 [3]. Similarly, the United States government formulated the popular Fair 
Information Practices (FIPs) since 1973 [4]. The development of modern data protec-
tion laws started with the Convention for the Protection of Individuals regarding  Auto-
matic Processing o f Personal Data,1981 (aka Convention 108). The Convention enu-
merated the core principles of data processing which are still the basis of modern data 
protection laws today. The next major intervention is the European Union Data Protec-
tion Directive, 1995. S imilarly, while issues around protection of citizen’s telephone 
conversation, correspondence, telegraphic communications, etc. are covered under sec-
tion 37 of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria [5], the National 
Information Technology  Development Agency (NITDA), pursuant to Section 6(c) of 
the NITDA Act 2007, issued a Data Protection Guideline in 2013. However, upon the 
issuance of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EUGDPR) in 2016, and other 
international developments on priva cy protection, NITDA issued the Nigeria Data Pro-
tection Regulation (NDPR) [6] on 25th January  2019.  
In Nigeria, Data Privacy and Protection regulation has been evolving since the in-
troduction of the NDPR which is a subsidiary legislation. The NDPR aims to safeguard 
the rights of citizens and people living in Nigeria to data privacy and protection in order 
to foster the integrity of commerce and industry in the volatile data economy. It also 
aims at enhancing the secure exchange of data; improve business ope rating environ-
ment and create sustainable jobs [6] . The NDPR applies to public and private entities 
processing data of Nigerians . 
In this paper, we examine the implications of data privacy and protection regulations 
in the context of a developing country – Nigeria, with particular attention to data inten-
sive businesses. These businesses include financial service providers such as 
banks/fund managers, telecommunications companies, health -care service providers 
and a host of other operators that need to take into account the Nigeria Data Protection 
Regulation (NDPR) requirements as it relates to their businesses. To address this issue, 
a research question was raised ‘ what are the  implications of the new NDPR for data 
controllers  in Nigeria ’? 
We provide answers  to this question through a comprehensive systematic literature 
review and analysis of feedback obtained from audit reports filed by entities as well as 3 
expert’s interviews. We found five key components of the NDPR that can compel, mo-
tivate or support orga nizations to make significant structural changes such as standard-
ization of processes, practices and IT assets to show conformity and/or gain legitimacy. 
We equally identified  the factors that facilitate or inhibit the adoption and implementa-
tion of the co nditions of the NDPR categorised in line with the three pillars of the in-
stitutional theory framework adopted for this study. The findings are discussed and 
enumerated to inform policy makers on the implications of their approaches towards 
ensuring complia nce. It will also educate businesses on necessary cause of action and 
changes to ensure privacy and protection of personal data they solicit from data sub-
jects. 
The remaining part of the paper is organized into distinctive sections as follows: 
Section 2 pr esents related works in the field of privacy and data protection. Section 3 
summarizes the concept of institutional theory. Section 4 discusses the methodology 
adopted for this study. Section 5 presents the result and discussion of the findings. Fi-
nally, S ection 6 concludes the paper . 
2 Related Work  
The growing dependence by businesses on information technology (IT) to manage their 
data has led to increase in information security and privacy risks implications. The term 
‘privacy’ is a multifaceted concept cur rently gaining traction in the field of computing. 
According to Nissenbaum  [7], privacy is a contextual integrity and one of the most 
enduring social issues associated with information and communication technologies 
(ICT). The author opined that privacy is  breached if personal data is used or made avail-
able outside its intended context. Data protection on the other hand refers to the pro-
cesses of safeguarding the confidentiality of data including ensuring its privacy and 
protecting it from compromise. Accor ding to Friedewald et al. , the concept of data pro-
tection is both broader and more specific than the right to privacy  [2]. Art. 8 of the EU 
Charter of Fundamental rights is the first legislative attempt to di stinguish data protec-
tion from priv acy. According to Lynskey [8],  the right to data protection provides indi-
viduals with m ore rights than right to privacy.  The enhanced control introduced by data 
protection serves two purposes - a) it proactively promotes individual personality rights 
which are threatened by personal data processing and b) reduces the power and infor-
mation asymmetries between individuals and those who process their data. In this re-
gard, data protection is not intended only to make the protection of privacy real but also 
seeks to protect other rights relating to conscience, non -discrimination and a host of 
other concerns or interests . 
Article 1 2 of the United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights provides - 
no one shall be subject to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or cor-
respondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to 
the protect ion of the law against such interference or attacks. The declaration is a state-
ment of intent of every member of the United Nations, including Nigeria. Article 8 of 
the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Free-4 
doms guarant ees the right to respect for private and family life, home , and correspond-
ence. The African Charter on Human and People’s Rights on the other hand does not 
provide for the right to privacy. This lacuna has been justified on the basis that Africa 
has more p ressing rights issues such as child labour, slavery, terrorism etc. However, it 
has been argued to the contrary that invasion of privacy by telecommunication compa-
nies on behalf of government is repressing fundamental rights to expression, beliefs and 
life.1 The courts have ruled that illegal monitoring of employees’ usage of computer 
such as private mails, browsing sites and social media activities is a breach of right to 
privacy2. Unlawful storage of data is also held to be a breach of privacy.3 
The gr owing concerns about automated personal data systems therefore resulted in 
the introduction of data privacy measures, regulations, and conventions in the western 
countries such as United States of America (USA) through the US Department of 
Health, Educatio n, and Welfare as well as in Europe through the Organization for Eco-
nomic Co -operation and Development (OECD) and EU  [1]. For instance, in a move to 
standardize the protection of personal data privacy, the European Union (EU) enacted 
the Data Protection Di rective in 1995  [9]. The directive which among other things pro-
hibits corporations and governments from using personal data for any purpose other 
than original purpose without permission, took effect in 1998  [10].  
Organizations are facing ever increasing regulatory interventions (e.g., GDPR, 
CCPA, NDPR, PIPEDA, HIPAA, etc.) that may lead to significant structural changes 
such as standardization of processes, practices,  and IT assets to show conformity and/or 
gain le gitimacy.  According to UNCTAD , 107 countries (of which 66 were developing 
or transition economies) have put in place legislation to secure the protection of data 
and privacy  [11]. Noteworthy is the growing level of adoption in comparing Europe, 
Asia and Af rica. 
3 Institutional Theory  
The manner in which organisations respond to changes is often dependent on the socio -
political, economic and technological influences exerted by the environment in which 
they operate as posited by Weerakkody et al., [12]. Thus,  the impacts of such external 
forces on organizational behaviour have been studied by many researchers using the 
institutional theory. The core concept of institutional theory is that organizational struc-
tures and processes tend to acquire meaning and achi eve stability in their own right, 
rather than on the basis of their effectiveness and efficiency in achieving desired ends, 
such as the mission and goals of the organization [13]. Few studies have focused on 
using the theory to understand the impact of IT -enabled change in organizations  [12]. 
According to DiMaggio & Powell, institutions exert three types of isomorphic pressures 
or effects, viz. coercive, normative,  and mimetic  [14]. Jennings and Greenwood [15]  
suggest that the notion of institutional pressu res is akin to the concept of institutional

Rights (ACHPR)

pillars proposed by Scott, which comprises of “regulative, normative and cultural cog-
nitive elements that, together with associated activities and resources, provide stability 
and meaning to social life”  (pp. 48)  [16]. The basic similarity in all institutional theo-
retical claims however, is that something identified at a higher level is used to explain 
processes and outcomes at a lower level of analysis [17] .  
In this research, the strength of the institutional th eory is employed to determine the 
various implications of data privacy and protection regulations on data intensive busi-
nesses in the context of a developing country – Nigeria. Specifically, Scott’s [16] three 
key pillars that can make up or support instit utions viz. regulative, normative and cog-
nitive are employed . 
Table 1. Institutional Theory Framework  
 
Source: Institutions and Organizations  pp. 51  [16] 
 
Institutionalization, through the lenses of the regulative pillar can be viewed as a stable 
system of rules that can be informal or formal backed by monitoring and sanctioning 
powers and accompanied by feelings of fear or guilt and/or innocence or incorruptibil-
ity. In normative systems, not only are goals and/or o bjectives defined, appropriate 
methods of pursuing them are also defined. Norms and values can vary depending  on 
what the position is or who the actors are. Thus,  the appropriate goals or activities as-
signed to particular actors or positions leads to the c reation of roles or normative ex-
pectations of how specific actors are required to behave.  Cognition can be described as 
the psychological result of perception and learning and reasoning.  Scott  [16], DiMaggio 
& Powell [14],  and other organizational scholars  have stressed the centrality of cogni-
tive elements of institutions as being the “ shared conceptions that constitute the nature 
of social reality and the frames through which meaning is made ” [16] pp.57.  
6 
In summary, the three pillars – regulative, normative and cognitive, all have their 
distinctive features and ways in which they operate as shown on Table 1. However, 
Scott pointed out that in most empirically observed institutional forms, a combination 
of th e pillars are observed at work which can lead to the formation of a stable social 
system  [16].  
This research contributes to the few studies that have applied institutional analysis 
as a theoretical lens for studying the implications of IS/ICT regulations on organiza-
tions.  For instance, institutional theory has been used by Appari  et al to explain the 
variability in regulatory compliance prevalent in the US healthcare sector  [18]. In their 
explanation of firms’ response to information security a nd privacy issues, Greenway 
and Chan  argue that information security research could leverage socio -organizational 
theory, like the institutional theory, to frame inquiries  [19]. Similarly, D‟Arcy and 
Hovav  advocate application of institutional theory to st udy the relationship between 
organizational characteristics and security best practices  [20]. In a developing country 
context, Dahiru et al have also used the theory to determine the associative interaction 
between exciters and inhibitors to technology ado ption [21].  
4 Methodology  
The research methodology adopted by this study is a qualitative one. A systematic lit-
erature survey backed by a pilot study was conducted in Nigeria between November 
2019 and January 2020. During this phase, the focus of the study is to obtain the impli-
cations of data protection and privacy laws/regulations on data intensive businesses 
across key sectors in Nigeria. Considering the broadness of the topic as well as potential 
legal and economic implications, a systematic literature r eview was initially conducted 
to provide insights into the topic and to collect adequate qualitative data [22]. Further, 
using the selected theoretical underpinnings of the institutional theory, a data collection 
instrument was developed to allow for expan sion of the research and to provide an 
evaluation mechanism. The pilot study was carried out in line with the design empha-
sised by Naoum [23].  As Naoum posited, lessons drawn from feedback in a pilot study 
helps the researcher to refine and check the instrument before the main data collection 
exercise . 
 
4.1 Research Context  
Considering key criteria, Nigeria is Africa’s largest economy  [24].  In addit ion, Nigeria 
launched one of the most vibrant campaigns towards enforcement of data privacy and 
protection on African content in recent time. Data collection and analysis were carried 
out in Nigeria cutting across key sectors including telecommunication, b anking and 
finance, and regulatory agencies. These sectors were selected based on their direct in-
volvement in the personal data processing and management to enhance the quality of 
data used in this study. As technology researchers involved in various stake holders’  
awareness programmes, the research team was able to access qualitative data through 
top quality interviews in both public and private sectors .

4.2 Data Collection  
The study relied on gradual but systematic literature reviews including audit reports 
and face -to-face interviews using a semi -structured interview guide. The systematic 
literature survey was conducted to elicit information required to meet the objective of 
this study. During the face -to-face interviews, selection of participants was made based 
on participant’s degree of invo lvement in the ongoing data protection and privacy rev-
olution in Nigeria. The selection process also employed snowballing approach that fa-
cilitated researcher’s contact with data privacy and protection experts across key sectors 
in Nigeria. In this pilot s tudy, seven data intensive organizations were considered  in 
both public and private sector and a total of eleven participants were interviewed. The 
participants included two executive directors, and three general managers, four senior 
managers and two CTOs . Participants profile a re summarized in table 2. All the inter-
views were conducted in English language with note taking and audio recording and 
lasted for 45 to 55 minutes.

4.3 Data Analysis  
Data relating to Privacy and Protection advances were analyzed using institutional the-
ory discussed in the previous section. Data Privacy and Protection issues in this study 
were evaluated within each domain (as shown in table 2) on the basis of qualitative data 
elicited t hrough interviews and credible documents relating to NDPR. In view of the 
relatively small number of participants involved in this pilot study, results from the 
interviews were analyzed using qualitative manual method . 
5 Results and Discussion  
In this section, we describe the most important findings based on the feedback from 
experts’ interviews , pertinent literature and audit reports. Considering the early stage 
of Data Protection regulation in Nigeria, the analysis focused on laying out the key 
issues  relating to implications of Personal Data Protection for data controllers in key 
sectors. We achieved this through useful inputs obtained from experts in terms of Per-
sonal Data Protection implications in the context of Nigeria.   
The recent adoption of NDP R brings about new obligations compelling all data con-
trollers handling Nigerian personal data to review their existing data privacy and pro-8 
tection policies to ensure compliance with NDPR. To guide these tasks, this paper iden-
tified key implications of NDP R for data controllers. The 5 key components of NDPR 
identified in the analysis are summarised in Table 3. 
Table 3.  NDPR Implications for Data Controllers  
NDPR Implications  Requirements  
Data Controllers to 
Designate a Data Pro-
tection Officer  
 Data Controllers are required to appoint competent person 
or outsource data protection to verifiably competent firm 
to ensure adherence to NDPR.  
 
Considering condi-
tions for data pro-
cessing in interna-
tional context  Data Controllers are obliged to ensure that Data Subject 
consent explicitly to the proposed transfer, after being in-
formed of possible risks of such transfer to a third country. 
Data Controllers must  ensure that Data Subject is mani-
festly made to understan d through clear warning of the spe-
cific implications of data protection likely to be violated as 
a result of such transfer to third country.  
 
Ensuring Data Sub-
ject's right to data 
portability  
 Data Controllers are required to ensure that data subject re-
serve the right to have personal data transmitted directly 
from one controller to another.  
 
Provision of measures 
for dealing with data 
breaches  
 Data Controllers are obliged to secure personal data against 
all foreseeable hazards and breaches such as theft, cyberat-
tack, viral attack, manipulation of any kind, and damage by 
natural elements.  
 
Reckoning with pen-
alty for dealing with 
default  Under NDPR, regulatory authority (NITDA) has powers to 
impose administrative fine on defaulting Data Controllers. 
Issues of non -compliance could cost Data Controllers a 
fine of up to 10 million Naira or 2% of Annual Gross Rev-
enue of the preceding year.  
 
Awareness of NDPR implications is key and can be viewed as the starting point for the 
NDPR requirements for implementation amongst data controllers. In this area, findings 
of this study only confirmed the awareness at the top -management level. For instance, 
when prompted to confirm the level of awareness of NDPR and the potential implica-
tions on their organizati on, participants of this study confirmed that only their top man-
agement is aware of the regulation and implications of not adhering to data protection 
laws, pr ocedures and policies. Although  the interview ees tend to confirm awareness at 
the management leve l, only one participant from the banking sector confirmed compli-
ance and steps taken to engage Data Protection Compliance Organization (DPCO). This 
is an indication of the need for additional awareness creation  and sensitization . Imple-9 
mentation of NDPR in Nigeria indicates the need to designate DP COs in various or-
ganizations, which may have considerable impacts on controllers’ technical compe-
tence and may need the hiring of more expertise.  
Organizations involved in data processing in international context a re also required 
to put in place security measures including rules for the onward transfer of personal 
data to foreign country or international organization. This principle is related to a host 
of other principles enunciated in the NDPR for data processing  regarding data minimi-
zation, specific purpose, lawful and legitimacy, accuracy as well as storage and security 
of personal data (Art. 2.1a to 2.1d). Adherence to these principles can be considered 
reasonable. However, interviewees from the banking sector expressed concern regard-
ing data they share with their partners in card sub -sector that maintain data centres 
worldwide , where in most cases , location of such centres remain unknown to them.  
This is in alignment with previous studies by Dahiru et al [21] t hat indicated how data 
is transferred to international 3rd parties without recourse to its sensitivity.  
Implementation of NDPR also introduces a new right  to data portability. This right 
imposes new capability on Data Controllers to ensure there is capabi lity to provide data 
subject their personal data in compatible format when the need arises. One of the un-
derpinning principles of the NDPR is that Data Controller must comply with basic min-
imum standards of information security management. In this regard, Data Controllers 
and Data processors are to ensure Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. Interview-
ees have all indicated that their organizations have created a new role for Data Protec-
tion Officer within the organization and have appointed or are i n the process of appoint-
ing an officer to fulfill that role.  
Regarding data breaches, implementation of NDPR imposes new obligation for Data 
Controllers to notify the regulatory authority and data subjects of any data breaches 
without delay. In this regar d, Data Controllers need to put in place notification mecha-
nisms which may require serious changes to the existing systems especially in the area 
of new technologies. When asked to indicate whether or not their organizations have a 
register for data breach es and security incidence, interviewees across the sectors inves-
tigated indicated “ NO” suggesting that they do not currently have an internal data pro-
tection policy in place to support implement ation of this NDPR commitment.  
Finally, implementation of the NDPR requires that Data Control lers and Data Pro-
cessors  reckon with sanctions in their processing principle for failure to do so may cost 
them a fine of up to 10 million Naira (Approx.  USD27, 000, or €24, 000) by the regu-
latory  authority . Response from interviewees indicate that while organizations are con-
cerned about fines in monetary terms, they are more worried with brand image damage, 
and marketing and publicity. Thus, to ensure compliance and avoid these sanction s, 
Data Controllers have started to  review their privacy and protection measure s to keep 
to this requirement . 
Further, the analysis of the audit report and feedbacks from experts’ interviews led 
to identification of several  factors arising from the adoption and implementation of 
NDPR in Nigeria. While some of the factors are positive and favourable  in facilitating 
the implementation of NDPR conditions, some are negative, and hence inhibiting the 
implementation of NDPR measures. These identified factors are categorised in line with 
the three pillars of institutional theory framework as shown in Table  4. 10 
Table 4.  Institutional Factors in the Adoption of NDPR  
Institutional 
Pillar  Facilitators  Inhibitors  
Regulative  Well -articulated policies and 
guidelines  Lack of organizational plans and 
initiatives regarding NDPR

ing Absence of legal framework and 
policy

managers on NDPR   
Normative  Awareness and sensitization

tives

holders in the implementation 
of NDPR  Resistance to change and risks of 
leaving personal data unprotected  
Communicating the benefits 
of Personal Data Protection to 
stakeholders  Not realizing the importance of 
NDPR.  
 
As Scott [16] pointed out, in most empirically observed institutional forms, a combina-
tion of the pillars are observed at work . Concerning the regulative pillar, formulation 
of well -defined policies appears to be the strongest factor facilitating the level of com-
pliance with NDPR measures amongst stakeholders. Thus, formulation of such policies 
received inputs from key actors thro ugh series of stakeholders’ engagements. Inhibiting 
factors under the same pillar include insufficient human capacity especially in technical 
areas and adequate training organized by top management . 
Regarding the normative pillar, it is important to note t hat some of the data control-
lers are willing to conform to industry best practices and recognize the opportunities 
therein, however, data subjects are not yet conversant with the newly acquired rights as 
a result of the introduction of the NDPR. The findin gs from  this stud y therefore suggest 
the need for continuous awareness for data subjects and adequate training for  data con-
troller s at organizational level . A major inhibiting factor highlighted under this pillar 
relates to absence or lack of funding for N DPR activities.  
Regarding the Cultural -Cognitive pillar, involvement of key stakeholders in NDPR 
implementation and communicating the benefits of Data Protection to stakeholders 
were highlighted as facilitating factors. Under the same pillar, resistance to  changes and 
risks of leaving personal data unprotected are highlighted as inhibiting factors. It is 11 
therefore imperative to learn how to deal with the cultural changes inherent in data 
privacy and protection initiatives such as NDPR . 
6 Conclusion and Future  Work  
This study attempts to identify Data Protection Regulation requirements and implica-
tions for Data Controllers and Processors in the context of a developing country - Ni-
geria. The research study analysed these implications using  the institutional the ory 
framework. Although the NDPR was launched in January 2019, most Data Controllers 
and Processors are yet to realise the complexity of its implications . 
The identified implications of the new changes introduced by NDPR adoption and 
implementation were c ollated with 5 key aspects  prioritised by Data Controllers for 
compliance in order to avoid sanctions from regulatory authority for non -compliance. 
Specifically, the research projects that controllers need to pay attention to awareness 
creation and designat e DPOs for proactive implementation of NDPR requirements. 
NDPR also specifies procedures for data processing in international context. Thus, Data 
Controllers must  consider this requirement when transferring personal data to third 
countries or international  organisations. Similarly, the NDPR introduces obligations 
that require Data Controllers to ensure data portability. Data Controllers also need to 
ensure uniform standards or interoperability of their procedures for seamless transmis-
sion of data. Regarding  data breaches, Data Controllers equally the appointment of a 
DPO that will support the compliance through the development of an internal data pro-
tection policy and a robust data breach reporting mechanism . Finally, as the NDPR also 
imposes sanctions for n on-compliance, Data Controllers need to review their strategies 
and reckon with sanction s and adequate budgetary provision to support compliance  
when planning.  
As part of the major contributions of this paper, some guidelines believed to facilitate 
the ins titutionalisation of NDPR measures across organisations were pushed forward. 
Evidence from this study as presented in the previous section suggests that use of insti-
tutional theory can help in interpretation of different level of NDPR adoption and im-
plemen tation by Data Controllers. It can also help to project policy direction enhancing 
the institutionalisation of NDPR measures across key sectors. It is imperative therefore 
to extend the scope of this study in the future to cover more organisations in order  to 
determine the extent to which the NDPR implementation facilitate s and support  the 
digital economy transformation in Nigeria .
