Abstract . There has been a proliferation of Mobile Phones Appl ications commonly referred to as 
Mobile Apps lately due to the advancement of technology. These Mobile Apps are used for a myriad 
of task s ranging from  Mobile Commerce  (m-commerce ), healthcare, learning, social media , among 
others. However, with th is sprea d of the Mobile Ap ps come s the issues of privacy concerns. This 
study, therefore, seeks to investigate why users continue to use the Mobile Apps despite the privacy 
concerns  and what measures they have put in place to mitigate this menace . Through the 
Ante cedents, Privacy, Concerns, and Outcome ( APCO ) model, the study developed a research model 
that was hypothesized and evaluated with 316 respondents from  a tertiary institution. The data was 
analyzed through the partial least squares structural equation  model (PLS -SEM). The results indicate 
that whilst antecedent variable Gender influences  Privacy Concern , Experience on the other hand 
does not . Also, Enjoyment, Privacy Risk, and Trust influence Usage Contin uance  Intention. Also, 
Application Popularity  influences Change Privacy Settings. Again , Privacy Concern influence 
Privacy Risk but does not influence  Trust. Moreover, Enjoyment, Privacy Risk, and Trust do not 
influence Change Privacy Settings. This study has given the researchers  insights as to why use rs 
continue to use Mobile Apps despite the Privacy Concerns that have been raised in the literature. 
Other implications for theory, policy , and practice are also discussed.

1. Introduction  
In recent time s, technology has advanced which has made mobile devices parsimonious. Thus, 
there is a proliferation of Mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets among others globally and 
this is progressing steadily in most developing economies such as G hana. The stat istics show that 
currently,  Ghana has “the highest mobile penetration in West Africa and already outperforms many 
of its regional peers ”. As at the  “end of 2019, mobile adoption stood at 55 percent, higher than the 
regional average which is a t 44.8 percent ”. Thus, “a huge number of people can be served through 
digital services, positively impacting the growth of the digital economy ” (Omondi , 2020).  Omondi 
(2020) further stated that “a s of the third quarter of 2019, Ghana counted 16.7 million u nique 
mobile s ubscribers, 15.1 million smartphone devices , and 10.7 million mobile internet users in the 
country (as of Q3 2019). 3G coverage accounts for 60 percent of the total connections, 4G has

started gaining traction and will overtake 2G services by  2023. 3G and 4G will account for nearly 
95 percent of total connections by 2025 ” (Omondi , 2020).  
A common phenomenon lately in the mobile devices’ ecosystem is the development of mobile 
phones applications (commonly referred to as apps) for the main thre e mobile device s platforms 
i.e. iOS, android and windows (Hoehle & Venkatesh, 2015)  where users can run various types of 
these “apps for a broad range of purposes, incl uding searching for online information, playing 
games, making purchases, and staying connected with others ” (Byun, Chiu, & Bae, 2018) . As a 
result, users are downloading, installing, and using all sorts of these apps ranging from those used 
for m-commerce/ electronic commerce ( e-ecommerce ) (Sun, Fang, & Hwang, 2019;  Zhang, Chen, 
& Lee, 2013) , social media /entertainment  (Benam ati, Ozdemir, & Smith, 2017; Lankton & Tripp, 
2013; Ozdemir, Jeff Smith, & Benamati, 2017) , health  (Conroy, Yang, & Maher, 2014; Martínez -
Pérez, De La Torre -Díez, López -Coronado, & Herreros -González, 2013) , religion  (Campbell, 
Altenhofen, Bellar, & Cho, 2014; Díez Bosch, Micó Sanz , & Sabaté Gauxachs, 2017; Richardson 
et al., 2020) , learning and research  (Pindeh, Suki, & Suki, 2016; Zydney & Warner, 2016) , 
language learning (Godwin -Jones, 2011; Pindeh et al., 2016) , sports (Byun et al., 2018; Guo et al., 
2017; Hing, Russell, Li, & Vitartas, 2018; Modave et al., 2015) , betting  (Hing et al., 2018; Lopez -
Gonzalez & Griffiths, 2018) , gaming  (Balakrishnan & Griffiths, 2018; Christensen & Prax, 2012; 
Lopez -Gonzalez & Griffiths, 2018; Merikivi, Tuunainen, & Nguyen, 2017) , among others. Whilst 
most of these apps are free, others demand a token fee from the users. The free ones are  sometimes 
overwhelmed with adverts, in -app purchases and also seek to exploit user’s privacy by asking for 
access to contacts list, pictures, documents, email, among others. Naive users who consent to these 
sometimes find their privacy being violated.  
Although, these apps are handy and have been making life more convenient for users as services 
that hitherto would have required users to travel to offices , etc. to  transact  business , can be done 
in one’s place of convenience   (Pagoto, Schneider, Jojic, Debiasse, & Mann, 2013) . In Ghana for 
instance, lately, the government of Ghana is in a digitalization drive where many se rvices such as 
acquiring Passports, Driving License, National Insurance Card, Ghana Lottery, P ayment of Utility 
Bills ( electricity, water etc. ) (http://www.eservices.gov.gh/) , among others are all having apps that 
users install and can use at their conveni ence. Due to the sensitivity of the data and the transactions 
involved, some of these apps are highly secured to prevent fraudsters from  duping users. However, 
when it comes t o the generic apps for social media, entertainment (games , etc.),  among others, 
security may not be that strong. Thus, a user’s privacy can be compromise d. Some of these generic 
apps in some instances, demand access to the user’s Phone Contact Book, Locat ion, Pictures, 
Videos, Music , etc. which can highly be a violation of the user’s privacy.  
Thus, this study seeks to  investigate why users continue to use Mobile Apps despite the privacy 
concerns  and what measures they have put in place to mitigate this m enace . Knowing these will 
help inform policymakers and Apps developers as to what measures they should put in place to 
mitigate some of the issues of privacy concern s arising from the use of Mobile Apps.  
The rest of the paper is as follows. The next secti on introduces readers to the Literature review 
which discusses the concept of Mobil e Apps, its applications , and benefits  derived from  their 
usage. The section further discusses the underpinning theory, related studies about Mobile Apps , 
and the conceptual  development with the formulation of hypotheses. The next section talks about 
the M ethodology with the survey questionnaire, sampling, and the data collection method. This is 
followed by the data analysis technique used and the discussions of the findings.  The c onclusion 
then follows with implications and suggestions for future studies.

2. Literature Review  
2.1 The concept of Mobile Apps  
Mobile Apps are pervasive lately and have permeated every aspect of our lives as a result of the 
proliferation of Smartphones which has made it easier for the development of these Apps ( Statista, 
2016). 
The Vodafone Group  (2015, p. 211 ) and Byun et al. (2018)  defined Mobile Apps as software 
programs “designed to run on smartphones or tablet devices and provide a convenient  means for 
the user to perform certain tasks” . Also, Hoehle and Venkatesh (2015)  in conceptualizing a Mobile 
Apps refers to it as “ an IT software artifact that is specifically developed for mobile operating 
systems insta lled on handheld devices, such as smartphones or tablet computers” . They further 
averred that Mobile Apps  either come  “preinstalled on mobile devices or can be downloaded from 
various mobile application stores ” (e.g., Apple’s iTunes store , Android Playstor e, Microsoft store).  
The benefits of Mobile Apps are numerous and usually depends on the purpose in which the y are 
developed for. In most ins tances, the use of Mobile Apps provides convenience to end -users which 
can help in reducing costs. Some of the high lighted benefits in the literature include the 
applications of Mobile Apps for weight loss (Pagoto et al., 2013) , learning and research (Zydney 
& Warner, 2016) , getting connected (Benamati et al., 2017; Lankton & Tripp, 2013)  among others.  
 
2.2 Underpinning theory  
This study is underpinned by the Antecedents, Privacy, Concerns, and Outcome (APCO) model 
propounded by ( Smith et al., 2011).  The APCO model  (Smith et al., 2011)  suggests antecedents 
variables Privacy Experience and Demographic Privacy Di fferences  (e.g. Gender, Age, among 
others) will influence Privacy Concerns. They continue to declare that Privacy Concerns will 
influence  Trust and Privacy Risk /Costs . Also, Trust, Privacy Risk, Benefits , and Perceived 
Application Popularity will influence  user’s Usage Continuance Intention and the Behavioral 
Reactions  (e.g., self -disclosure, risks, and regulation)  of the application.  
Although the APCO model has been used extensively to study different phenomenon such as e -
commerce/m -commerce (Sun et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2013) , social media site s (e.g. Facebook) 
(Benamati et al., 2017; Ozdemir et al., 2017) , sharing ec onomy  (Li, Lee, & Yang, 2019)  among 
others, little is k nown about it when it comes to that of Mobile Apps which have seen extensive 
growth lately. This study thus aims to contribute theoretically in this regard to fill the gaps left in 
the literature.

The results also reveal ed that 
“neither trust nor privacy risk 
have  significant influences on 
the privacy behaviors but do 
significantly influence 
continuance intention ”.  
Also , “enjoyment influences 
continuance intention ”. 
 
 As indicated in Table 1, most  of the studies about the APCO model have focused on 
Social Media, e -commerce, m -commerce, sharing economy among others. Also, in terms of the 
context, the focus has been on developed economies leaving the developing economies behind. 
Thus, this study will  add up to the scanty literature in the developing country context.  
 
2.4 Conceptual Model and Hypotheses Development  
The formulation of hypotheses for the various relationships unearthed in the APCO macro model  
is done in this section . Table 2 presents  the meanings of the constructs used in this research and 
illustrates how  they correlate to the APCO constructs. The research model is presented in Figure 
1 which  was developed based on the APCO model as discussed above and extant literature.

Experience – The mobile apps “model includes privacy experience as an antecedent to privacy

“finds that nonusers of a social network site had higher privacy concerns than users ”. We include 
“the prior experience to capture these effects, as users with more prior experience are m ore likely 
to have encountered privacy abuses ”. Besides, Sun et al. (2019)  in their study find out that “the

of privacy  concerns” . Also, Lankton and Tripp (2013)  find out that “ Experience does not influence 
privacy concern ”.  
 
Based on the above discussions, i t is there hypothesized that:  
H1: Experience will positively influence Priva cy Concern  
 
Gender  – We use gender in our model to address population disparities as suggested by mobile 
apps. Researchers have found that females are more interested in privacy th an males in general. 
Sheehan (1999)  reports, for example, that females are more interested than males when an app 
claims its publicly identifying information is accessed by certain companies. We say that it is less 
relaxed for females to be in touch with u nknown individuals than for males t o be worried about 
the opportunism of those in mobile apps. Furthermore, Fogul and Nehmad (2009)  identified 
females with much more mobile apps privacy issues than males, suggesting that females have less 
control over the security of their privacy than male s by implicit social contracts.  Also, Zhang et al. 
(2013)  find that “the consumers’ demographic d ifferences have varying degrees of impact on their 
concerns for information privacy in the context of m -commerce”.  In another study, Lankton and 
Tripp (2013)  find out that “Gender  does not influence privacy concern ”. 
 
Based on the above discussions, it is there hypothesized that: 
H2: Females will have greater  Privacy Concerns than Males 
 
Privacy Concerns  – Privacy concern negatively affects Trust since larger concerns may make 
“one less likely to feel they can rely or depend on the technology ”. Whilst Privacy Concern “relates  
to the likelihood of not having desirable results, Trust refers to the likelihood that one can depend 
and rely on the trustee to perform desirable actions ” (Fogel & Nehmad , 2009 ; Owusu, Br oni J nr, 
& Akakpo, 2019) . This implies a negative relation amongst the variables. Empirical research 
demonstrates that “Privacy Concern negatively influences Trust” (Eastlick et al., 2006 ). In another 
study, Lankton and Tripp (2013)  established that “ Privacy Concern has positive  significant effects 
on Privacy Risk”. 
 
Based on the above discussions, it is there hypothesized that:  
H3: Privacy Concern will positively influence Privacy Risk 
 
Mobile Apps “depicts privacy risk, trust, and behavioral reactions as out comes of Privacy 
Concerns” (Fogel & Nehmad , 2009) . Both Privacy Concern and Privacy Risk signify “the costs of 
disclosing information ” (Dinev & Hart, 2006 ). The two variables are “highly related because 
perceptions that one’s personal information might be used opportunistical ly can influence one’s 
perceptions that personal information , in general,  might be used opportunistically ”. In a study by 
Lankton and  Tripp (2013) , they found that “ Privacy concern has no significant effects on trust”.  
 
Based on the  above discussions, it is there hypothesi zed that:  
H4: Privacy Concern will negatively influence Trust  
 
Mobile apps also predict that privacy concern s will affect behavioral reactions. The more mobile 
app privacy concerns “the more one is likely to exerci se privacy behaviors to control their pers onal 
information and prevent bad things from happening ”. Privacy concern s can make mobile apps 
“users more likely to take action to protect their privacy ”. In mobile apps, “privacy behaviors  can 
include changing vendor privacy settings ” (change privacy set tings) ( Lankton et al., 2012 ), 
“limiting the number of friends in one’s friends ' list (limit number friends) and allowing only 
friends one has interacted with a lot in one’s friends list (di fferentiate friends) ” (Debatin et al., 
173

2009; Stutzman & Kramer -Duffield, 2010 ). These “responses to high concerns are consistent with 
expectancy theory’s explanation that individuals are motivated to minimize negative outcomes ” 
(Dinev & Hart, 2006 ). We als o “include usage continuance intention in our model as a behaviora l 
reaction to privacy concerns ” because some mobile apps “users might discontinue use if their 
concerns are too high ”. A study by Lankton and Tripp (2013)  established that “Privacy concern 
has no significant e ffects  on continuance intention”.  
 
Based on the above discussions,  it is there hypothesized that:  
H5a: Privacy Concern will positively influence  Usage Continuance Intention.  
H5b: Privacy Concern will negatively influence Change Privacy Settings .  
 
Trust  - Mobile Apps also predict that “Trust and the Privacy Risks and ben efits involved in the 
privacy calculus decision will influence behavioral reactions ” (Fogel & Nehmad , 2009) . Trust 
“plays an important role in predicting privacy behaviors ” (Dinev & Hart, 2006). Trust lowers “the 
perceived concerns about revealing informat ion making one feel that disclosure is a safe activity ” 
(Metzger, 2004 ). If some one decides an app “is dependable and reliable one will be less likely to 
take steps to keep informati on private ”. Trust “also predicts usage continuance intentions because 
when one is willing to depend, one makes a conscious choice to put aside doubts and move forward 
with the relationship ” (Holmes, 1991 ). Benamati et al. (2010)  find that “Trust influences intention 
to use a bookseller website ”. Lankton and Tripp (2013)  in their study established  that “ Trust ha s 
no significant influence on Change Privacy Settings but do significantly influence Continuance 
Usage I ntention”.  
 
Based on the above discussions, it is ther e hypothesized that:  
H6a: Trust will negatively influence Usage Continuance Intenti on. 
H6b: Trust will positively influence Change Privacy Settings.  
 
Privacy Risk  - The final relationships that deal with mobile apps “are the effects of Privacy Risks 
and benefits on behavioral reactions ” (Fogel & Nehmad , 2009) . Similar to “Privacy Concern s, 
Privacy Risks should increase the likelihood of engaging in privacy behaviors t o protect the 
opportunistic use of personal information ” (Wu et al., 2012 ). These risks “should also make one 
less likely to want to continue ” using mobile apps.  In another s tudy, Lankton and Tripp (2013)  
established that “Privacy Risk ha s no significant influence on change privacy settings  but do 
significantly influence Usage C ontinuance Intention ”.  
 
Based on the above discussions, it is there hypothesized that:  
H7a: Privacy Risk will positive ly influence Usage Continuance Intention.  
H7b: Privacy Risk will positively influence Change Privacy Settings.  
 
According to previous stud ies that inspire the mobile apps model, “benefits from using technology 
should decrease one’s privacy behaviors and in crease continued use ”. We contemplate Enjoyment 
as a gain of mobile apps use because “Enjoyment is a major reason people use social networking 
apps” (Xu et al., 2008 ). The more “enjoyable using the mobile apps, the less likely one will engage 
in privacy be haviors because this might stifle one’s ability to  make use ” of the app.  Enjoyment is 
“part of the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology for consumers as a 
predictor of continuance intention ” (Venkatesh et al., 2012 ). People will “want to continue using 
a technology they find enjoyable ”. Prior research finds “that enjoyment significantly influences 
the intention to continue using mobile apps ” (Sledgianowski & Kulviwat, 2009 ). In another study, 
Lankton and Tripp (2013)  established that “ enjoyment influenc es continuance intention”.

Based on the ab ove discussions, it is there hypothesized that:  
H8a: Enjoyment will posit ively influence Usage Continuance Intention.  
H8b: Enjoyment will negatively  influence Change Privacy Settings.  
Popularity - The popularity o f apps has a positive effect on the behavior of people  to continue 
using the app (Ferdous, Osman i, & Mayora, 2015a) . Ferdous, Osmani, and Mayora (2015b)  
contend that “s martphone app usage behavior is driven by factors such as the popularity of apps 
(e.g., how many categories of apps a user visited and how is his/her attention spread) , frequency 
and duration of app usage (e.g., how often do es a user use an y application and how long is the app 
used), frequency of unique apps used (e.g., if the user keeps using only a few apps regularly or the 
list of his/her visited apps is large) ”. In a study by Ferdous et al. (2015a) , they found out that 
“perceived app popularity make s them less concerned ” and also “ a positive effect of perceived 
App Popularity on download intention ”. Also, in another study, Shen (2015)  find out that “Apps' 
Populari ty is more effective when  the app carries low perceived risk”  which leads to Usage 
Continuance Intention .  
 
Based on the above discussions, it is there hypothesized that:  
H9: App popularity will positively influence U sage Continuance Intention.  
H9: App pop ularity will positively influence Change Privacy Settings . 
 
3. Methodology  
The quantitative approach with the survey method was used for this study. Data was collected 
through a survey method with stratified and convenience sampling from 316 students from a 
tertiary institution in Ghana. The questionnaire comprises three sections  with section one asking 
questions about the respondent’s demographics. Section two dealt with the antecedent variables 
and the independent variables whilst the last section asks qu estions about the dependent variables. 
The Constructs were operationalized as follows: Experience has 2 items, Application Popularity, 
Trust, and Enjoyment all have 3 items each, Privacy Concerns and Privacy Risk each has 4 items. 
All these constructs were  measured on a 5 -point Likert Scale with “1” representing “Strongly 
Disagre e” and “5” representing “Strongly Agree”.  The items were adapted from (Smith et al., 
2011; Fuller, Serva, & Benamati, 2007; LaRose & Rifon, 2007; Smith, Milberg, & Burke, 1996) ). 
The data was collected through a hand -deliverin g questionnaire where the students were given 
ample time to fill the questi onnaire in their respective halls of residence and return them on a given 
date. It took almost three months to collect the data.  
 
4. Analysis and Findings  
The demographics were anal yzed through SPSS version 22 and the inferential statistics done 
through Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS -SEM) specifically with 
SmartPLS 3.3.2

Table 3 shows the demographic profile of the respondents. 48.4 % of the respondents wer e males 
whilst 51.6% were females. Thus, the majority of the respondents were females. In terms of the 
Age distribution of the respondents, 38.6% of the respondents were found in the 30 -39 age 
categories followed by 23.4% who were f ound in the 40 -49 age ca tegories. The greater percentage 
of the age distribution is above 30 years because most of the respondents were students doing their 
Master s's degree. Regarding the respondents ' usage of Smart Phones, all of them declared they 
used smartphones. This is an indication of the proliferation of Smartphones in the Ghanaian 
economy.  
 
4.2 Inferential statistics  
The survey data collected were subjected to partial least squares structural equation modeling 
(PLS -SEM) where the 2 -step approach of  analyzing data in SEM was employed. The measurement 
model was assessed firstly, which was then followed by the evaluation of the structural model 
(Hair et al. 2017). SmartPLS 3.3.2 (Ringle et al., 2015) was used to assess both the measurement 
and structur al models.  The use of P LS-SEM is justified by its popularity lately in terms of handling 
of data that is not normally distributed and handling of complex research models like our 
conceptual model in this study ( Hair et al., 2014, p. 19 ). Thus, PLS -SEM has been used in a lot of 
recent studies which includes (Abdurrahaman, Owusu, & Bakare, 2020; Owusu, 2017, 2019; 
Owusu, Agbemabiese, Abdurrahaman, & Soladoye, 2017; Owusu, Ghanbari -Baghestan, & 
Kalantari, 2017)  in Information Systems and (Abdurraham, Owus u, Soladoye, & Kalimuthu, 2018; 
Bakare, Ow usu, & Abdurrahaman, 2017)  in Advertising and Marketing.  
 
4.2.1 Assessing the Measurement Model  
4.2.1.1 Reliability and Validity Test  
Creswell (2012, p.159)  defines Reliability as “scores from an instrument are stable and consistent.” 
Also, Saunders et al. (2009, p.156)  defined reliability as “the extent to which your data collection 
techniques or analysis procedures will yield consistent findings”. Furthermore, Creswell (2014,  p. 
200) asserted that the “vali dity and reliability of scores on instruments are prime to mean ingful 
interpretations of data”.  
 Reliability comes in different forms. One form is “internal consistency” which is 
computed by calculating the Cronbach’s alpha (Saunders et al. 2009, p.374; Hair et al. 2014, 
p.101) . Also,  “Cronbach’s alpha measures the degree to which” the items used are “internally 
reliable with other items” including the construct. This “takes values ranging” from “1 (which 
indicates the item s correlate perfectly) and 0 (which denotes the items are total ly inconsistent)”. 
An “alpha score of above 0.70 indicated internal consistency and was considered reliable” 
(Nunnally, 1978).

The reliability test for this study’s instrument was assessed through both Cronbach’s alpha value 
as well as the composite reliability (Hair et al. 2014, p.98)  as shown in Table 4. The data was also 
subjected to confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to get insights as to the multidimensionality of the 
items using SmartPLS 3. 3.2 (Ringle et al., 2015) and discriminant validity test. Cronbach alpha 
value “provides an estimate of the reliability based on the intercorrelations of the observed 
indicator variables” (Hair et al. 2014, p.101) . Cronbach’s alpha has a weakness of assuming all the 
indicators are equally reliable (that is “all the indicators have equal outer loadings on the 
construct”) and it is also “sensitive to the number of items in the scale and generally tends to 
underestimate the internal consistency reliability” (Hair et al. 2014, p.101) . However, composite 
reliability “takes into account the diff erent outer loadings of the indicator variables” (Hair et al. 
2014, p.10 1) and thus ensures more reliability on each construct.  
 Table 4 illustrates the summary measurement model with the “Cronbach Alpha, 
Composite Reliability, and the Average Variance Extracted (AVE) values” of all the constructs. 
As shown in Table 4, the tes t results revealed that all the latent “variables meet the Cronbach alpha 
value of 0.7 or higher” (Nunally, 1978), which “is the acceptable value for reliability”. Also, the 
results indicate that all the “measures are robust in terms of their inte rnal cons istency reliability” 
which is shown by “the composite reliability”. The composite reliabilities values of the different 
measures in the model range from 0.716 to 0.951 which well exceeds “the recommended value of 
0.7” as shown in Table 4. Also, fr om Table 4, all the AVE values are well above 0.5. This proves 
that all the indicators for each construct converge very well to form the constructs (Hair et al. 2014, 
p.107) . However,  Change_Privacy_Settings and Gender each have only one indicator. As a result, 
the outer loadings, Cronbach alpha, Composite Reliability, and AVE all s how 1. This is acceptable 
as indicated by Hair et al. (2014, p.) .

 Again, from Table 4, the confirmatory factor analysis illustrates acceptable factor loading 
on the hypothesized measurements. The outer loadings of almost all the indicators meet t he 
accept able value of 0.7 or higher which is recommended for indicator reliability with very few 
falling below 0.7. However, these indicators were maintained as (Wong, 2013 ) has reco mmended 
values of 0.4 or higher for exploratory research.  The indicators below 0.7 have their values ranging 
from 0.553 (Exp1) to 0.694 (Exp2) and hence they were maintained. However, the outer loadings 
“Per_App_Pop3” has very low outer loading o f 0.205. As a result, it was deleted.  
 Construct  validity confirms if the items measure hypothetical constructs as planned 
(Creswell , 2014, p.206 ) . This has become very helpful in recent studies and has “focused on 
whether the scores serve a use ful purpose and have positive consequences when they are used in 
practice.” Also, Creswell (2014, p.206) emphasized that “establishing the validity of the scores in 
a survey helps to identify whether an instrument might be a good one to use in survey resea rch.”  
 After the reliability test, the next analysis was to check the validity of the measures. This 
was done by the disc riminant validity via the Fornell -Larcker criteria.

From Table 5, all the constructs meet the satisfactory values for “discriminant v alidity based on 
the Fornell -Larcker Criterion” (Hair et al. 2014, p.105; Fornell & Larcker, 1981) , as “the square 
root of each construct's AVE is greater than its highest correlation with any other construct”.  
 
4.2.1.2 Assessing the Structural Model  
The structural model is assessed in the second st age only after determining that the measurement 
model satisfies all the acceptable values.  
 But before evaluating the structural model, the researchers assessed if collinearity  exist s 
among the constructs. Collinearity measures if the constructs are highly  correlated and it s refer to 
as multicollinearity if it involves more than two constructs ((Hair et al. , 2014, p.218). 
 Collinearity issues are calculated by the computation of  tolerance levels and the variance

inflation factor (VIF) values. The VIF is def ined as the reciprocal of the tolerance (Hair et al. , 
2014, p.124). For PLS -SEM, Hair et al. (2014, p.125) and Hair, Ringle, and Sarstedt (2011) 
confirmed that “a tolerance val ue of 0.20 or lower and a VIF value of 5 and higher ” respectively 
among the pred ictive constructs indicate a possible collinearity problem.

 From Table 6, all the predic tor constructs have their VIF values below 5, which implies 
that multicollinearity issues are not found among them. Therefore, the other test such as the 
significance of path coefficients, effect sizes, and so on can be carried on using the model.  
 
4.2.1.3  Hypotheses testing  
The bootstrapping technique was used for the testing of the hypotheses. SmartPLS 3.3. 2 generates 
the t-value which “provides the statistical significance of the causal path between the constructs in 
the hypothesized model”. Hair et al. (2014, p.164) declared that “for a two -tailed test, the popular 
critical t -values in PLS -SEM are 1.65 (α =  0.10), 1.96 (α = 0.05), or 2.57 (α = 0.01)”.

4.2.1.4 The coefficient of determination - R square  
Denoted as the R2, value, the coefficient of determination measures the model’s predictive 
accuracy in PLS -SEM. The R2 value is computed as “the squared correlation between a specific 
endogenou s construct’s actual and predicted value”. The R2 value “is the representation of  all the 
exogenous latent variables” collective “effects on the endogenous construct”. It is “also the amount 
of the variance in the endogenous constructs which is explained b y all of the exogenous constructs 
linked to it” (Hair et al., 2014, pp. 174 –175).  The R2 value has “a rule of thumb with values ranging 
from 0 to 1”. Values of “0.75, 0.50, or 0.25 for endogenous latent variables have been specified as 
substantial, moderat e, or weak, respectively” (Hair et al., 2014, p. 175).  
From Table 8, the R2 values of 0.389, 0.017, 0.001 , and 0.223 indicate that the combined effects 
of exogenous latent variables Trust, Privacy Risk, Enjoyment , and Perceived Application 
Popularity expla in 22.3% of “the variance of the endogenous construct” Usage Continuance 
Intenti on. Similarly, the exogenous latent variable Privacy Concern explain s 38.9% on Privacy

Risk and 0.1% of Trust respectively. Also , antecedent variables Experience and Gender exp lain 
1.7% of exogenous latent variable Privacy Concern s. 
 
4.2.1.5 Effect sizes  
Denoted as f2, the effect size is “used to measure an exogenous latent variable’s influence on an 
endogenous construct’s” R2 value. The f2 value is used by researchers to measur e the relevance  of 
individual “latent variable’s contribution in explaining the v ariance of the endogenous constructs”. 
The rule of thumb for f2 values ranges from “0.02, 0.15 and 0.35 indicating an exogenous 
construct’s small, medium or large effect, resp ectively, on an endogenous construct” (Hair et al., 
2014, p. 186).  
From Table 8, with an f2 value of 0.584, it emerged that Privacy Concern has the highest effect 
size on Privacy Risk. Also, with an f2 value of 0.133, Trust has a medium effect on Usage 
Continuance Intention. Also , with an f2 value of 0.051, Enjoyment has a small effec t on Usage 
Continuance Intention. The rest have insignificant effect sizes on the Usage Continuance Intention.  
 
4.2.1.6 Model’s Predictive Relevance  
The predictive relevance of  the model was “assessed through the Stone –Geisser’s Q2 value” 
(Geisser, 1974; Stone, 1974). This “study followed the blindfolding procedure” via “the cross -
validated redundancy approach as recommended by ” (Hair et al., 2014, p. 183), “to calculate the 
Q2 value”. As shown in Table 8, the Q2 values of 0.267, 0.008, 0.002 , and 0. 184 indicate the 
structural path model has predictive relevance as they are all above 0.  
 
5. Discussions  
This study set forth to investigate why users continue to use Mobile Apps desp ite the privacy 
concerns it brings. The findings from the analysis  indicat e that whilst antecedent variable Gender 
influences  Privacy Concern s, antecedent variable Experience on the other hand does not influence 
Privacy Concern s. Also, Enjoyment, Privacy R isk, and Trust influence Usage Contin uance  
Intention. Also, Application Po pularity  influences Change Privacy Settings. Again , Privacy 
Concern influence Privacy Risk but does not influence  Trust. However, Enjoyment, Privacy Risk, 
and Trust do not influence Change Privacy Settings.  
Antecedent variable Experience has been established to influence Privacy Concerns (Ozdemir et 
al., 2017) . However, contrary to the hypothesized model, in this study, Experience does not 
influence Privacy Concerns. This finding is in support of the findings of (Lankton & Tripp, 2013) . 
This may be due to the fact that the respondents sampled in th is study are students who  are 
relatively young and have not gotten much of life experience hence, in adopting mobile Apps they 
do not hinge their privacy concern on experience.  
Research has proven that females have much more mobile apps privacy issues than  males, 
suggesting that females have less control over the security of their privacy than males by implicit 
social contracts  (Fogul & Nehmad, 2009) . Thus, it was hypothesized that the antecedent variable 
(Gender) in  terms of Females will have greater priva cy concerns than males . Our results indeed 
have established the fact that females are more concerned in terms of their privacy issues in support 
of the findings of (Zhang et al., 2013) . From this finding, it is apparent that the privacy concerns 
of the females who use mobile Apps should be given priority attention. This is to assure them of 
the protection of their information as such t hey will be more willing to continue usin g the Apps.  
Privacy Concerns  have been established to be a strong variable when it comes to the adoption of 
mobile apps. Thus, as hypothesized that Privacy Concern s will positively influence Privacy Risk, 
it was revealed that indeed Privacy Concerns influe nce Privacy Risk in this study thus confirming 
the findings of (Lankton & Tripp, 2013) . Also, as hypothesized that Privacy Concern will 
negatively influence Trust , it was found out that Privacy Concern does not influence Trust in  this 
study. This finding is in support of (Lankton & Tripp, 2013) . Similarly , we hypothesized that 
182

Privacy Concern will positively influence  Usage Continuan ce Intention  as well as Privacy Concern 
negatively influenc ing Change Privacy Settings . The findings from the analysis revealed that both 
hypotheses are not support ed as Privacy Concerns do not influence both Usage Continuance 
Intention and Change Privacy Settings. Thus, the findings are in support of (Lankton & Tripp, 
2013). Given these findings, it can be submitted that organizations cannot rely on Privacy 
Concerns to achieve Trust, Usage Continuance Intention , and Change Privac y Setting about their 
mobile Apps.  
It has been established that Trust “plays an important ro le in predicting privacy behaviors ” (Dinev 
& Hart, 2006).  Thus, we hypothesized that Trust will negatively influence Usage Continuance 
Intention  but will positively influence Change Privacy Settings.  Our findings revealed that Trust 
has an influence on Usa ge Continuance Intention but not on Change Privacy Settings.  Thus, this 
finding is in support of (Lankton & Tripp, 2013) . This impl ies that any organization that wants to 
sustain the usage of its Apps by its cust omers should make sure that the customers are able to 
develop trust in the App. Organizations can achieve th is by making sure that the information of 
the customers is highly protected.  
Privacy Risks are predicted to  “increase the likelihood of engaging in  privacy behaviors to protect 
the opportunistic use of personal information ” (Wu et al., 2012).  These “risks should also make 
one less likely to want to continue using ” mobile apps.  Thus, we hypothesized that  Privacy Risk 
will both positively influence Usa ge Continuance Intention  and Change Privacy Settings.  The 
findings show that Privacy Risk has an influence on  Usage Continuance Intention but not on 
Change Privacy Settings. This finding is in support of (Lankton & Tripp, 2013) . Privacy risk is the 
“potential loss of control over personal information. it is clear from these findings that having 
gotten the consent of customers to use their personal information, organizations th at have such 
information must safeguard it adequately. This is what can guarantee customers’ usage 
continuance intention.  
Based on “p revious  research that motivates ” the mobile apps “model, benefits from using 
technology should decrease one’s privacy behav iors and increase continued use ”. We believe 
Enjoyment as a gain of Mobile Apps use because “Enjoyment is a major reason people use social 
networking apps ” (Xu et al., 2008) . The more enjoyable using mobile apps, “the less likely one 
will engage in privacy  behaviors because this might stifle one’s ability to make use of the app ”. 
Thus, we hypothesized that Enjoyment will positively  influence U sage Continuance Intention  but 
negatively  influence Change Privacy Settings.  The analysis indicates that Enjoyment h as an 
influence on Usage Continuance Intention but not on Change Privacy Setting. The findings are in 
support of (Lankton & Tripp, 2013 ; Sledgianowski & Kulviwat, 2009 ). Enjoyment as far as 
technology is concerned refers to the intrinsic reward  derived through the use of the technology.  
Therefore, going by these findings it is suggested that mobile Apps should be designed in such a 
way that it contains features that will enable the users to derive enjoyment while using it. In other 
words, featu res that offer hedonic value to the customers should be embedded in the mobile Apps 
in order to sustain their usage continuance intention.  
Prior research has established that the  popularity of apps has a positive effect on the behavior of 
people  to continu e using the app (Ferdous et al., 2015a) . Thus, in thi s study, we hypothesized that 
App Popularity will both positively influence  Usage Continuance Intention  and Change Privacy 
Settings . Our findings revealed that App Popularity influence Change Privacy Settings but not 
Usage Continuance Intention. This findi ng is in contrast to that of (Ferdous et al., 2015a; Shen, 
2015) . Given these fin dings, it means that App Popularity is one of the factors that can be leveraged 
in order to influence the Change Privacy Settings of the App users.  It, therefore,  implies that 
organ izations should strive to make their App popular.

6. Conclusion  and Reco mmendations  
The primary aim of this study was to investigate why users continue to use Mobile Apps despite 
the privacy concerns it brings. Our findings have revealed that whilst Antecedent Variable Gender 
influences Privacy Concern, Experience does not. A lso, Privacy Concern influences Privacy Risk 
but not Trust, Usage Continuance Intention, and Change Privacy Settings. Also, it was established 
that Enjoyment, Privacy Risk,  and Trust have an influence on Usage Continuance Intention but 
not on Change Privac y Settings. Moreover, App Popularity has an influence on Change Privacy 
Settings but not on Usage Continuance Intention.  
 In terms of contributions to theory, this study de veloped a conceptual model based on the 
APCO model which was tested with empirical d ata to establish the hypothesized relationships 
through an SEM. Thus, this study has contributed to the body of knowledge from a developing 
country context where there is a  dearth of literature regarding the phenomenon (Mobile Apps 
Privacy Concerns) being discussed.  
 In terms of contribution to policy and  practice, our findings have established that Mobile 
Apps users are more concerned with the Enjoyment they derived from u sing the Apps, yet they 
are more afraid of their Privacy Risk. Therefore, their cont inuance usage of the Apps depends 
largely on the Trust of the App. So, policymakers should make legislations that will guide Apps 
developers to make sure that the Apps bein g developed are highly protected of users’ privacy.  
 This study like any other has s ome limitations. First, although the sample data was enough 
to be generalized, yet the data collection was done from only one tertiary institution which is based 
in Accra. Thus, it becomes difficult to generalize the findings. Future studies can stratify a nd 
collect data from not only students but the working class, as well as rural dwellers. Also, not all 
the variables in the APCO model was studied. Future, studies can intr oduce other variables 
especially more demographics as antecedents’ variables.
