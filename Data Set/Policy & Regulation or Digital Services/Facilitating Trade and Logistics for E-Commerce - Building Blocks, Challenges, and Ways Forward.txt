 Executive Summary  
 
The advent of e -commerce offer s new challenges and opportunities for governments and firms. 
Although a larger number of firms can trade across borders because of e -commerce, the basic 
functions and roles of government at the border continue to remain the same, with emphasis on 
manual c ontrol of the transaction. However, more recently such manual methods hav e given way 
to a more modern approach.  
This modern approach focuses on finding a balance between control and facilitation, using 
information and communication technology, data and pe rformance measures all aimed at 
promoting compliance rather than focusing  only on enforcement. Although this approach has 
resulted in significant reform in countries, e -commerce, technology, big data, and other 
developments have led to a renewed impetus in many countries for continuing  the reform and 
modernization path. As countries travel this path of reform and modernization, many 
governments are grappling with the effect of these new developments.  
This note identifies the various issues and challenges relating to e -commerce from a facilitation 
and logistics point of view and  identifies potential solutions, particularly those in which the World 
Bank Group (WBG) can play a role in helping developing c ountries. The note draws from a wide 
array of developments and literature, and from work done by the WBG more generally in trade 
facilitation and logistics in assisting countries to improve their trade environment.  
The note begins by establishing its purpose and objective together with setting out the scope of 
its focus and the importance of trade facilitation and logistics for e -commerce. The note asserts 
that although e -commerce remains a small share of total goods traded, its growth has been 
remarkable,  resulting in major innovations in the way businesses approach new markets, positive 
implications for innovation, and growth for firms and economies.  
E-Commerce is transforming trade globally. Business -to-Consumer (B2C) transactions grew  from 
US$1.5 trillion in 2014 (Hanna 2016a) to US$2. 3 trillion in 2017 and  projected to grow to US$4.88 
trillion in 20211 . E-commerce is growing f our times faster than the world economy. Cross -border 
e-commerce market in 2015 was estimated at US$300 billion and is expected  to be worth US$ 
900 billion by 2020 (DHL2). The latter category of cross border e -commerce is impacted by trade 
facilitation and  logistics. P oor trade facilitation and logistics has numerous effects on firms

spice_trade_apem_en.pdf

 (market access, growth, sales, and exports) and  consumers (price, choice, and delivery time). 
Border agency procedures increase the transit time between origin and destination,  and 
therefore their procedures play a vital role in aiding or deterring exports and imports. Extended 
delays for a trader resu lt in lost profitability because of inventory -holding costs or lost business 
opportunities because of  failure to get goods to mar ket in time (Hummels and Schaur 2012). For 
many exporters, the delayed delivery of critical imported inputs can derail the prod uction process 
and result in costs that are higher than the market value of the imported components (Nordås, 
Pinali, and Geloso G rasso. 2006).  
What, therefore, are the challenges and opportunities in facilitation and logistics for e -
commerce? The note disc usses the key challenges that include: (a) an undeveloped legal enabling 
environment; (b) a low level of readiness among border agencies to tackle e -commerce; (c) the 
need to improve national quality infrastructure; (d) poor integration of postal services with 
border agencies; (e) the need to improve air connectivity; (f) the poor reach of logistics and postal 
delivery in remote are as; and (g) the policy challenges created by exponentially advancing 
technologies in last mile logistics.  
The note then goes on to explore the required building blocks for facilitating cross -border e -
commerce as to address the challenges raised above and c onsist of: (a) improvement programs 
for creating a more conducive legal environment for automation; (b) improving automation and 
interconnectivity between agencies; (c) implementing simplified procedures to trade, including 
for e -commerce; and (d) implemen ting fully the WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement. Although 
these are some of the issues that affect trade facilitation general ly, they are also crucial for e -
commerce. At a minimum, having these building blocks established enable the necessary 
improvement  to countries’ abilities to participate and benefit from e -commerce.  
The note next discusses the importance of the role of postal services in the enabling of e -
commerce  and the need for their integration with Customs to greatly reduce the steps required 
for e-commerce goods arriving by the postal service to clear customs procedures (WCO 2015b).  
Postal operators in most countries a re trusted intermediaries with a legal standing and often are 
required to serve all citizens. And, although many postal operators  have been freed somewhat 
from government constraints  in the last three decades ; that is, they have been corporatized or 
privat ized, they  will need to continue to adapt to new developments , be more agile, contain 
costs, guarantee quality and reliability, a nd have technologies that can integrate with vendors 
and customers. Postal operators around the world are likely to be key play ers in cross border e -
commerce provided they adapt sufficiently to service the market and most notably better 
integrate with customs.  
Closely related to issue of postal service delivery  are the logistics of last mile delivery and remote 
connectivity. Chal lenges in last mile delivery abound. Quite often, it is the most challenging and 
expensive leg of goods delivery and is estimated  to be up to 50 percent of the delivery cost 
sometimes (DMCC 2016). Some characterize these last -mile distribution systems as n etworks: a 6 
 collection of nodes (that is, distribution centers) and links (that is, roads) over which goods flow 
using specific ve hicle technologies (Merchán and Blanco 2015). For discussion purposes , a simple 
stylized network structure of last mile deliver y with three key elements is proposed: the 
distribution center, the delivery vehicle, and the receiving point. With the rise of e -commerce, 
the models of these three elements are being revisited extensively by firms and will have 
implications for governmen t policies. The developments and challenges to these three elements 
are explored.  
For many small markets, the challenges of cross -border commerce and the opportunities it 
provides can be harnessed through stronger regional integration. The benefits of regi onal 
integration are well known, and this note further highlights how those benefits that lead to 
reduction in costs for traders and consumers are particularly critical for the e -commerce sector. 
Six steps are explored  to improve e -commerce  regional integr ation and cover : (i) a reduction in 
transaction costs; (ii) the development of common approaches to regulatory issues; (iii) the 
drafting of a strategy for the a regional economic community (REC) on e -commerce; (iv) to ensure 
that national efforts, particularly those related to the TFA articles that would enhance e -
commerce, are fully implemented; (v) for trading partners to coordin ate responses to last mile 
connectivity in border regions; and (vi) for trading partners to develop common approaches to 
air transport that would include a roadmap and provide for market access that would help 
expand the potential of ecommerce.  
The note co ncludes with the summation that E-commerce offers new challenges and 
opportunities for governments and firms, but to maximize i ts benefits requires significant reform. 
This note has set out a path for countries to continuing  the reform and modernization ro ute with 
recommendations and an action matrix of specific  improvements to the  trade facilitation and 
logistics environment that will better position countries and firms to take advantage of the 
enormous potential that cross border e-commerce  offers.

 Introduction 
 
Objectives  
The objective of this note  is to identify the key issues in trade facilitation and logistics that affect 
the e -commerce landscape , with a focus on cross border (trade facilitation) domestic delivery 
(logistics) ; highlight key challeng es and opportunities , particularly for developin g countries and 
small and medium enterprises ( SMEs ); and provide a roadmap for potential areas of World Bank 
support in that  landscape . 
The World Bank Group (WBG) has been working in  trade facilitation and lo gistics for several  
decades and has provided extensive support to its members in improving their trade 
performance.  This work has broadly covered areas such as  customs and border management ; 
information and communications technology  for trade ; logistics se rvices , including c ompetition 
issues;  and trade -related infrastructure (ports, inland ports, airports , and so on ). However, new 
developments, technological change and disruption in the fields of big data, automation and 
robotics, and e -commerce p rovide an opportunity to both policy  makers and those advising them  
to take stock, review , and modify , if necessary , their reform path. As such, t his note is one in  a 
series being prepared on e -trade that seek s to develop a comprehensive set of solutions for 
supporting developing coun tries engaging in and benefiting from digital trade . The note  series  
aims  to increas e knowledge of the challenges of e -trade, generat e data, identify best regulatory 
practices, and , from there , design country -specific interventions for developing countrie s 
(Ferrantino and Molinuevo 2016) . 
The advent of e -commerce offers new challenges and opportunities for governments and firms. 
Although  a larger number of firms can trade across borders because of e -commerce, the basic 
functions and roles  of government at the border —providing security, collecting revenue, 
facilitating trade , and ensuring health and safety —continue to remain  the same . Howe ver, the 
historical approach of government at the border— its emphasis on manual control of the 
transact ion with limited data ; focus on goods ; physical inspection and identification of 
noncompliance ; and limited cooperation with other agencies, private sect or, or neighbors —has 
given way  to a more modern approach. This approach focuses on finding a balance be tween 
control and facilitation, using information and communication technology , data, performance 
measures , and a n approach aimed at promoting  compliance  rather than focusing only on 
enforcement that move s toward building partnerships with trade and collab oration among  
agencies and with neighbor ing trading partners . Although  this modern approach has resulted in 
significant  reform in countries , e-commerce, technology , big data, and other developments have 
led to a renewed impetus  in many countries for continuing  the reform and modernization path.  
As they travel this path of reform and modernization, many governments are grappling with the 
effect  of these new  developments , including e -commerce , about  cross -border trade . 
Governments are concerned about  risks su ch as loss of revenue ; effects  on health and safety ; 
smuggling;  evasion and reduction in compliance of traders ; and increase d volume of small 8 
 shipments that still have  the same process ing costs as large, high -value shipments.  Policy makers 
have to address questions such as the following:  
• Do facilitation and logistics have specific challenges that hinder cross -border e -
commerce?   
• What opportunities —specifically , in facilitation and logistics —can help governments 
promote e -commerce?  
• What are the building bloc ks for ecommerce?  
o Do regulations for commerce in goods adequat ely cover e -commerce –related 
trade?   
o What are the underlying laws and policies that need to be in place to create an 
enabling environment for e -commerce trade , and are they different from those  
for regular cross -border trade ? 
• What are some of the policy solutions , and how can we embed in them in our reform 
programs ? 
This note discuss es some of t hese questions and provide s guidance to policy  makers.  Table A in 
the appendix  of the note highlights  potential opportunities for WBG support to its clients . 
 
Scope of Note  
This note  identifies  the various issues and challenges relating to e -commerce from a facilitation 
and logistics point of view  and identif ies potential solutions, particularly those in which  the WBG 
can play a role in helping developing countries. The note  draws from a wide array of 
developments and literature (see bibliography ) and from work done by the WBG  more generally 
in trade facilitation and logistics in  assisting countries  to impr ove their trade environment. This 
note is limited in scope , that is,  it does  not seek to comprehensive ly identify all issues and 
challenges, nor identify all international obligations and commitments that affect e-commerce or 
present a definitive appr oach to solving the facilitation and logistics challenge for e -commerce. 
Instead, i t highlight s key issues that need to be addressed in relation to trade facilitation and 
logistics for e -commerce, including through the various opportunities available to th e WBG , that 
is, the implementation of the World Trade Organization’s Trade Facilitation Agreement and the 
opportunity to embed e -commerce –specific solutions in bank operations. Moreover, like with all 
trade transactions, there is need for three movements: goods  or materials, information and 
money in ecommerce.  While this note is not explicitly organized in such a manner, it aims to bring 
out the key challenges and developments on these movements in relation to ecommerce 
wherever possible.  
The note  does not focus  on the key infrastructure gaps related to banking, payments, I nternet 
and communication, or other road and transport infrastructure . These gaps are considered 
beyond the  scope of this note . Issues related to the larger investment climate agenda and 
busine ss regulation , including competition -related aspects , are also not covered in this note. In 
addition, the paper is not focused on B2B, B2C etc but rather on identifying the impact of 
government policies (or lack of) on facilitation and logistics.  9 
 The defin itions of e -trade, e -commerce, digital trade , and the types of e -trade are elaborated in 
the concept paper  (Ferrantino and Molinuevo 2016)  by the World Bank . This note uses those 
definitions in refer ring to the above terminology. For other concep ts in trad e facilitation and 
logistics, the note references definitions and best practice developed by the WBG , World 
Customs Organization (WCO) , World Trade Organization  (WTO), and United Nations Conference 
on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), among others.   
Box 1: Definitions of e -trade  
Figure 1: Types of e -trade  
 
With small differences , the main focus of most definitions of e -trade seems to be on the sale 
of goods and  services through digital networks, with the explicit or implicit exclusion of 
orders made by telephone  calls, facsimile or manually typed e-mail (OECD, 2011). This 
concept  is adopted for the purpose of this  analysis.  However, in order to more accurately 
capture the different types of transactions involved in the digital  economy, this analysis 
makes further specifications in the language:  
• The term “e -trade” is used for all  forms of goods and services (both traditional and digital)  
traded internationally through electronic means, in line with our working definitions cited 
above;  
• The use of “e -commerce” is reserved to describe the purchase o f traditional goods and 
services  
through digital means; whereas  
• The transactions involving digital goods and services are referred to as “digital trade.”  
In this sense, both “e -commerce” and “digital trade” appear as subgroups of e -trade, as 
further expl ained  in the section below and il lustrated in Figure 1  10

Importance of Trade Facilitation and Logistics for E -Commerce  
E-Commerce is changing the la ndscape for cross -border trade.  Through e -commerce, firms can 
access global  markets at the same time through digital means , reducing the costs associated with 
traditional business  and means of finding new markets, which require investment in travel time 
and face -to-face meetings with new trading partners. Through onl ine platforms and 
marketplaces , SMEs  can ente r new international markets without the need to establish a physical 
presenc e in a country , finding a ready -made and cost- effective export infrastructure  (figure 1) . E-
Commerce platforms also offer services to e ngage with third -party logistics for  deliver y of goods 
to clients3.

Although  e-commerce remains a small share of total goods traded, its growth h as been 
remarkable , result ing in major innovations in the way businesses approach new markets , positive 
implications for innovation , and growth for firms and economies. In 2005, the share of total goods 
traded by e -commerce was 3 .0 percent , increasing to 1 2.1 percent  by 2012. Business- to-
                                                      
3 In 2017, for instance cross border ecommerce sales by SMEs accounted for over 25 percent of total third party 
sales on Amazon (Amazon)  
 
11 
 Consumer (B2C) transactions grew from US$1.5 trillion in 2014 (Hanna 2016a) to US$2.3 trillion 
in 2017 and projected to grow to US$4.88 trillion in 20214 . The number of online shoppers has 
grown from 600 million in 2013 to  850 million in 2015  (UNCTAD 2016b ). In 2015, 128 million 
consumers in China engaged in online purchases from other countries. Projections suggest that 
by 2020, in China alone, 700 million people will buy foreign products online with expected sales 
of US$157.7 billion  (King 2016a ). China  is the largest online retail market with e -commerce sales 
of approximately US $1.33 trillion  in 201 8, it surpassed the US in 2013  (Digital Commerce5). In the 
United States, surveys show that as many as 96 percent of people  shop online , spending five 
hours a week  doin g so (Renfrow 2016) . In Latin America, e -commerce has increased from US $1.6 
billion in 2003 to US$43 billion in 2013  (Brazil has the largest share at 59  percent)  (Savrul, 
Incekara, and Sener 2014) . In other market s like India where e -commerce is growing but still small 
at US$ 19.8 billion in 2018 , over 1 .9 million shipments a day ( KPMG)  even though online sales still 
represent only 2.9% of all retail sales ( eMarketeer6). The Global Express  Association calculates 
that more than  30 million shipments are processed daily and dispatched in more than  1,700 
airplanes and more than  200,000 ground vehicles by its members  (GEA 2016) . Although  overall 
cross -border shopping still accounts for just a fr action of total global e -commerce spending, it is 
growing at a rate of more than 25  percent  annually  (Stevens 2016) . This exponential growth has 
implications (see f igure 2): many governments are likely to see e -commerce as a driver of not 
only innovation b ut also export -driven or c onsumption- based growth (Schenk 2016; UPS 2016) .

Note:  Air e -commerce items count is estimated to reach more than 950 million by 2025.  
The upsurge of SMEs entering the global trade environment has been aptly described as the rise 
of randomized trade.  Companies  find themselves as “accidental exporters”  (The Economist 
Intelligence Unit 2014, p. 15).  They had no  plan to conduct cross -border trade and come from 
unexpected parts  of the world . Now, however, they  have the tools to participate in global trade  
easily .7 Data gained  from firms in 18 countries that use  eBay shows that more than 90 percent of 
SMEs using e Bay are export ing to other countries.  Two million sellers use Amazon, while  Alibaba 
has over 8.5 million sellers and mails 4.3 billion packages via United P arcel Service  around the 
world  (Smith 2017) . An increase in SMEs entering the global trade space has led to the rise of 
micro multinationals, particularly in the United States , where large multinational corporations’ 
export share fell  from 84 percent in 19 77 to 50 percent in 20138. Similar trends are also seen in 
other emerging markets . In Indonesia , small firms are using Lazada and Matahari Mall to expand 
their market share , while in India, Snapdeal, Flipkart, Amazon , and many others  are popular.  
Although  large firms can exploit the opportunities afforded by e -commerce, SMEs, which form 
the largest share of firms of most developing countries, often deal only in small consignme nts 
and have difficulty navigat ing the complexity of international trade : 
Today's global trade practices are highly fragmented. A typical overseas purchase, 
for example, requires the various parties in the logistics process to trade more 
than 60 different documents across partners, countries, languages, and time 
zones. With edits, updates, and status changes, a typical shipment can require 
hundreds of document exchanges. Most of the information is re -keyed over and 
over into each partner's proprietary syste ms and transferred by fax, mail, and e -
mail. This  delays the movement of information and payments, and limits visibility 
across the trading community  (Inbound Logistics 2007) .  
Managing international trade documentation and information requirements, the obligation to 
meet international and foreign domest ic standards , and other shipping and logistics challenges 
drive up their cost s and hamper their ability to trade. In other words , “today’s trade rules largely 
reflect 20 th century patterns of trade and are not well suited to supporting the growth of e -
comm erce ” (Schenk 2016) . 
In terms of  goods sold over the I nternet, regulations and logistics have a significant effect  on both 
the margin of cost to the consumer and an increase in the time for goods to reach their 
destination. Although the transaction is stil l traditional, consumer sensitivity to prices and time 
can particularly reduce market access for SMEs and affect the attractiveness of cross -border e -
commerce for consumers.  This note explore s some of these issues because  many governments 
are interested in  exploring whether they need to make changes in regulations or the  regulations’  
application  so that their countries can benefit from e -commerce. Governments still need to 
ensure regulatory compliance , and co nsumers (stakeholders) still demand that goods comply

 with regulations on health, safe ty, and so on . Governments are concerned with  risks such as loss 
of revenue ; effects  on health and safety ; smuggling ; evasion and reduction in compliance of 
traders ; and increase d volume of small shipments that still cost as much  to process as large, high -
value shipments.  The e -Trade Readiness Index identifies a country’s international trading 
environment as a critical factor for e -trade because  the Internet may lev el the playing field but 
tariffs and customs procedures that affect delivery time and thus raise costs still play a large role 
in determining a country’s ability to compete globally  (The Economist Intelligence Unit 2014) .  
The annual State of Logistics Rep ort (A.T. Kearney 2016) by the Council of S upply Chain and 
Management  Professionals  highlights that “ ‘gaps ’ in infrastructure and ‘accelerating trends for 
speed ’ will increasingly put pressure on a logistics system not designed for e -commerce –driven 
‘last mile, last minute ’ delivery service ” (Kilcarr 2016) . Marc Althen, president of Penske Logistics, 
noted that  “consumer expectations are changing. They want their products delivere d fast and 
they don’t want to pay a lot of money for delivery . Shippers are struggling to meet the challenges 
these expectations create”  (Schulz  2016) . This circumstance is also crucial for policy  makers to 
understand as they seek to deter mine the best app roaches to regulating e -commerce logistics in 
both dense urban areas and remote locations . Current regulations may need updating in many 
countries.  
Cost of Poor Trade Facilitation and Logistics  
The cost of poor trade facilitation and logi stics has numerou s effects  on firms (market access, 
growth, sales , and exports) and consumers  (price, choice, and delivery time) . The effect  on 
market access for firms is  lost sales and revenues and limit ed growth , and consumers do  not 
benefit from lower prices and greater choice. The effect  may be  more intense for countries with 
small markets and for SMEs about  their competitiveness. Border agency procedures increase the 
transit time between origin and destination, and therefore their procedures play an important 
role in aiding or deterring exports and imports. The Doing Business Trading Across Borders 
Indicator  has highlighted for over a decade now  that trade procedures, processing of documents , 
and compliance with clearance requirements by customs and other technical cont rol agencies 
account for more than 50 –60 percent of the total time to export and import in many countries 
around the world  (World Bank 201 0). 
The time involved in  trade matters for goods, because many products are subject to a rapid loss 
of value.  This depreciation can be due to spoilage ( for example , perishables), fashion cycles ( for 
example , shoes and garments ), and outdated technology ( for example , consumer electronics)  
(Hummels 2007) . Consumers’  preferences  can change quickly . As a result, time becomes 
important particularly if the period between order and delivery is so long that consumers a lter 
their orders (Deardorff 200 1). Extended  delays for a trader result in lost profitability because of 
inventory -holding costs or lost business opportunities becau se of  failure to  get goods to market 
in time  (Hummels and Schaur 2012 ). For many exporters, the delayed delivery of critical imported 
inputs can derail the production process and result in  costs that are higher than the market value 
of the imported compone nts (Nordås , Pinali, and Geloso Grasso . 2006) .  
Late delivery of goods is  more problematic for e -commerce cross -border trade because e -
commerce importers and consumers expect speedy delivery as part of e -commerce’s business 14 
 model and service provision. Further, competition in the e -commerce space among  firms and 
with physical retail locations is often based on quick and free delivery. “ A core aim for many [ of 
these firms ] is, no matter what system is deployed,  to deliver goods the same day that they are 
purchased and provide shoppers with one less re ason to go to physical stores. The challenge is 
to achieve this at a low cost. Fulfillment costs currently account for 15% of sales for many 
companies and so reducing these whilst improving service is a fine line ” (DMCC 2016, 60 –61). 
Although  Amazon pionee red this approach through a subscription service for prime membership 
(free two -day delivery for  members) , the method  has rapidly taken off across firms and countries. 
In India, the major players often offer 1 -hour delivery for certain products in certain cities. In the 
United Kingdom,  surveys show that consumers are willing to pay up  to US$7 for same -day 
delivery. In DHL's 2017 Holiday Survey, 27 percent of the integrator's customers surveyed said 
that they would "rather get a root canal than have personal  holiday shipments come late."  
(Supply Chain Brain 2017 ). A 2016 Deloitte survey found that 89 percent of shoppers say they 
consider fast shipping to mean delivery within two days or less  (Supply chain brain, 201 6). Given 
these consumer preferences , meeting shipping commitments is crucial for survival of  e-
commerce firms , and any delays or costs create even more difficulty  for these firms to trade.  
Complicated and overly  burdensome border agency procedures are a g eneral problem for all 
international trade , but cross -border e -commerce experience s greater hard ship. According to the 
Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development ( OECD ), such procedures increase the 
price of goods by up to 24 percent (GEA 2016) . Excessively complicated border procedures can 
be even more problematic for traders participating in e -commerce, because  they send many 
small consignments , infrequently or irregularly using normally a faster method of shipment (i.e. 
air) rather than singl e large ones. Importers participating in e -commerce are often small 
businesses and, as a result, are more sensitive to the costs incurred from  customs and border 
agency procedures. Some businesses have stated that customs procedures have contributed to 
their decisions not to enter certain markets , such as those  in the Russia n Federation (National 
Board of Trade, Sweden 2012) . Another issue is that SMEs that ship occasionally would not be 
able to receive preferential treatment that AEOs (for example) might re ceive as given their 
infrequent participation in trade they do not qualify for benefits that accrue to low risk traders.  
The use of manual procedures in physical documentation requirements continue s to be the norm 
in many developing countries. For example , in Ukraine, electronic data interchange ( EDI) files are 
not accepted by border agencies  (National Board of Trade, Sweden 2012 ). Another example is 
the “comparison of customs fees for regular and e -commerce sized shipments of four food 
products from Canada  to the USA. As these fees are largely charged on a flat rate basis, they place 
e-commerce shipments at a considerable competitive disadvantage relative t o traditional 
truckload sized shipments. Customs fees remain geared towards large shipments and perhap s 
did not matter when most shipments crossing borders were large truck or container loads but 
does in the e -commerce world  … Existing fee structures make cross border trade through e -
commerce expensive”  (Boyd, Hobbs, and Kerr 2003 ). Further, SMEs find it more expensive to ship 
items that don’t have economies of scale and cannot take advantage of bulk freight economies 
of scale.

 Economic Opportunity for the  World at L arge for T rade  
E-Commerce is transforming trade globally . E-commerc e is growing four times faster than the 
world economy. Cross -border e -commerce market in 2015 was estimated at US$300 billion and 
is expected to be worth US$ 900 billion by 2020 (DHL9). A sizeable share of e -commerce is cross -
border  trade , estimated to ave rage 16  percent among the six main markets —the United States , 
the United Kingdom , Germany, Brazil, China, and  Australia  (Hanna 2016a) . The link between 
improving the trade facilitation environment and positively affecting trade  is now well 
researched.  Acco rding to one study, a 10 percent increase in a country’s index of transparency 
and impartiality leads to a 5 percent increase in its import volume  (Anderson and Marcouiller 
2002) . Others have found a positive correlation between better quality of regulations and 
increased bilateral trade  (De Groot and others 2003 ). Hoekman and Nicita (2008)  find that 
improvements in logistics performance and trade facilitation have a great er effec t on increasing 
trade for a country than lowering tariffs.  Reducing transaction costs related to  trade, by changing 
public policies  and improving regulations  and procedures for import and export supply chains , 
are critical for enabling a country to expand i ts trade opportunities.   
Time reduction for trade can positive ly affect growth, bilateral trade, exports, prices, and gross 
domestic product ( GDP ). According to data gathered through a 146 -country study, a one -day 
reduction in inland transport time leads to a 7 percent increase in exports (equivalent to a 1.5 
percentage point reduction in all importing -country tariffs)  (Freund and Rocha 2011) . Similar 
conclusions have been stated by Hummels (2007) who finds that one extra day in transit for time -
sensitive products such as fruit and vegetables is equivalent to lowering their price by 0.9 
percent.  Hummels and Schaur (2012) show that one day saved in shipping time is equivalent to 
a 0.6 –2.3 percent reduction in the ad valorem tariff for manufactured goods. The y also find that 
long transit times reduce the probability that a country will export.  Other World Bank analysis 
has found that a 1.0  percent reduction in time to export increases exports by 0 .4 percent  
(Djankov, Freund, and Pham 2010; Hausman, L ee, and Su bramanian 2012) . Several studies have 
examined the effect of reducing the time and cost of trade transactions on  promoting trade 
growth ( table 1 ).

Despite promising statistics in the growth of e -commerce, firms report several challenges that 
impede their ability to take full advantage of e -commerce to engage in global trade  (figure 4). 
Removal of some of these barriers woul d have a significant effect on a country’s economy.  For 
instance, a ccording to the United States International Trade Commission, “removal of foreign 
barriers  … would result in an estimated 0.1 –0.3 percent increase in U.S. GD P…. U.S. real wages 
would be 0.7 –1.4 percent higher” ( USITC 2014, 14).  Many of these barriers  apply to both large 
firms and SMEs.  However, some challenges affect SMEs more significantly while other challenges 
are ranked differently by SMEs in terms of importance.  SMEs have low volumes an d small margins 
compared to larger firms.  Therefore , high costs associated with investment in new infrastructure 
or systems, education  about policy and procedural requirements, and compliance with 
regulations that are often unpredictable can lead to unplanned activities that drive up their 
business costs, thus dampening the attractiveness of e -commerce. In many contexts, such 
barriers have led firms simply to avoid some markets.  Surveyed firms in the European Union (EU) 
report that their most problematic issue is  that their  good s or services are not suitable to e -
marketing and electronic platforms. C hallenges around logistics , payments , security 
considerations, and the  legal enab ling environment are also cited as significant obstacles 
preventing SME engagement in e -commerce  (Savr ul, Incekara, and Sener 2014).

Note:  ICT = information and communicat ions technology; SME = small and medium enterprises.  
 
The effects of time reduction on exports, prices, and tariffs are  particularly positive for  SMEs, e -
commerce platforms , and logistics companies. “E-commerce is a huge export and growth 
opportunity for s mall and medium enterprises …  in particular. It increases export part icipation 
and broad- based trade from SMEs. When trade transactions are cross -border, e -commerce 
increases export diversification and expands the gains from trade. It gives consumers a wid er 
variety of goods and services at lower cost ” (Hanna 2016a, 5) . The  World Economic Forum (2016) 
estimates  that global trade can increase by as much as 70 percent because of  trade simplification 
with the possibility of digitally enhanced platforms able to  capture 20  percent  of this increase. It  
estimates that this increase  can not only provide SMEs access to a global marketplace with an 
18 
 estimated growth  in profits of more than US $600 billion , but also  drive additional value of US $50 
billion for logistics c ompanies . 
Challenges in Facilitation and L ogistics for 
E-Commerce 
This section discusses selected challenges for facilitation and logistics for e -commerce. Key 
challenges include (a) an undeveloped legal enabling environment ; (b) a low level of readiness 
among border agencies to tackle e -commerce ; (c) the need to  improve national quality 
infrastructure ; (d) poor integration of postal services with border agencies; ( e) the need to 
improve air connectivity ; (f) the poor reach of logistics and postal delivery in remote areas ; and 
(g) the policy challenges created by exponentially advancing technologies in last mile logistics. 
These are briefly discussed below .  
Challenges That Impede Firms from Engaging in E -Commerce 
Undeveloped  legal enabling environment  
The appropriate legal and regulatory environment for trade tran sactions to occur  on the Internet 
is a necessary building  block for e -commerce.  Regulations for e -commerce that enable e -
signature, e -transactions, and e-payments are critical legal infrastructure t hat must be in place 
for e -commerce transactions. The  importance of this necessitates a more detailed discussion that 
can be found later in the note .  
Low level of r eadiness of border agencies  
Most trade -relate d agencies in developing countries manage trad e processes that are paper  
driven and centralized; there are multiple fees with burdensome procedures; and some agencies 
have overlapping roles . The level of readiness is different in developed  economies in com parison  
to developing countries. For most bord er control agencies  in developing economies , the focus  is 
controlling goods at two stages —before  import and at the time of import —with very little focus 
on post  import  activities . Paper -driven processes, combin ed with limited geographic presence of 
non-Customs  border control agencies,  represent a n obstacle to traders and create a 
disadvantage for those that do not reside  in the capital city of the destination country . Ordinary 
processing of documents requires physical visits to obtain forms, apply and submit supporting 
documents, pay fees, and collect the resulting certificate or permit. Several agencies often have 
a role in  ensuring compliance for the same products , especially in the food and agriculture  
sectors .  
There is little  reuse of data, sharing of i nformation , or collaboration in processes such as 
inspections of goods involving many agencies. The paper -driven processes are one cause for this 
situation, but wea k institutional structures and lack of delegation also create inefficiencies . 
Although modes t, the fees associated with the border control agencies’ services are not 
transparent . Payment systems  are mostly cash or check  based , and payments must  be made  to 
either a local cashier or a dedicated bank and include handling of deposit slips to control the 19 
 procedure. The use of  technology offers opportunities such as  electronic payments that include  
mobile payments , but these are still nascent . Although  these issu es affect all aspects of trade , e-
commerce , which must  use the Internet and automation to fa cilitate trade , is clearly affected 
more  so. 
The low level of readiness among border agencies leads to increased costs and l engthy time to 
trade , which have a significant effect  on firms engaged in e -trade, particularly SMEs. 
Cumbersome border agency proce dures pose a significant challenge for firms that may not have 
the capacity to deal with regulatory requirements of multiple agencies in other countries , 
particularly if their procedures are paper based. The se procedures  significantly affect  SMEs that 
are shipping small parcels to several locations ; they do not enjoy the benefits of economies of 
scale of large , organized supply chains that move goods in l arge volume and can subsume high 
costs to comply with bureaucracy  (The Economist Intelligence Unit 2014) . The high costs owing  
to customs delays, late deliveries, or inefficient return procedures  affect SME bottom lines more 
significantly.  
Many Customs agencies perceive e -commerce as a threat, to varying degrees. The perception of 
a threat was driven by a range of factors, including the increased costs for the agencies associated 
with what was called a “tsunami of parcels”; perceptions of increased risks of counterfeit/illicit 
goods and smuggling; perceived loss of revenue through evasion of cross -border duti es and taxes 
or substitution from bulk to individual imports (putting them below thresholds for tax/duty 
collection); and “unfair competition” with local retailers. Customs in many developing countries 
argue that a key role of border policies implemented b y Customs was to protect local SMEs 
becoming more active in online retail, who are always on “the losing side” because of the growth 
of cross -border e -commerce10.  
In developed  economies, customs and border agencies are focused on improving their 
management  of risk for  millions of parcels for which detailed data on consignors or consign ees 
are not always available, adding complexity to the clearance process.  Many OECD border 
agencies are discussing options with various third- party logistics providers and marketplace 
fulfillment companies to  find solutions to manage these risks.  The EU for insta nce estimate s 5 
billion Euros of revenue was lost annually because of the non- declaration of dutiable or taxable 
goods associated with e -commerce; that there was not a level playing field of regulations facing 
e-commerce firms; and the risks of intellectua l property violations had grown11. 
Need to improve n ational quality infrastructure  
As e-commerce expands, the importance of upgrading national quality infrastructure (standards, 
accreditation, metrology, and conformity assessment) and , importantly , the trade -related 
processes revolving around them become important.  E-commerce  consumers demand product 
traceability , and conformity to international standards helps reassure t hem that products are

 efficient and safe.  For many categories of goods being traded through e -commerce, the 
importance and use of standards and certification become crucial.  The case of the exploding 
hoverboards in the United Kingdom in  2015 is an example.  The National Trading Standards  (2015)  
of the United Kingdom  claimed that 15,000 of the 17,000 hoverboards, or 88 percent, that were 
shipped into the United Kingdom  were deemed unsafe and  detained at national entry points . It 
worked nonstop  to prevent these from entering the supply chain (Collins 2015) . Once the issue 
was identified, U .K. border agencies were able to manage  the risk appropriately  and consistently 
in accordance with the principles of risk management .  
In many developing countries, however, inadequate attention to the national  quality 
infrastructure affects  potentially both health and safety and  the speedy  mov ement of products  
across borders .  First, many developing countries have introduced many  compulsory standards .12 
Although  intended to  protect health and safety , these standards  also include quality -related 
elements , for which voluntary standards are typical ly more appropriate. The reasons for this 
variance are discussed in numerous other papers (see , for example,  Huria and Brenton 201513).  
Regardless, this variance leads to an a ttempt to control a larger number of products upon entry 
in the importing country  than is necessary , and enforcement at the border often becomes a 
further barrier to trade. Government agencies charged with community protection often face 
funding shortages and lack qualified personnel and equipment, creating difficulty for them to 
carry  out their mandate  effectively.  Any rapid growth in the number of transactions and packages 
traded through e -commerce  has obvious  implications for overwhelming these agencies ’ 
resources and capacity , particularly when they do not focus on the community pro tection 
mandates A second issue related to the management of risk across the supply chain and the 
different levels of development of that risk amongst agencies in exporting c ountries (often low 
capacity developing countries) and importing countries . In dev eloped importing countries for 
instance there is a large role for voluntary compliance unless products are identified as high risk 
given the large volumes of trade and this l eads to the lack of visibility in the supply chain that can 
                                                      
12 Compulsory standards are often confused with technical regulations in many coun tries  many developing countries 
have introduced many  compulsory standard s which are often confused with technical regulations. The confusion 
related to the use of the term “standards” stems from its multiple meanings, and from a frequent lack of clarity 
regarding the similarities,  as well as the differences, between standards and technical regulations. Technical 
regulations are adopted to facilitate trade, protect consumers through information, and more broadly, human safety 
or health, the environment and o ther public goods .  
13 One reason for this has been the need to generate autonomous revenue for the standards institution which 
originates primarily due to a lack of the separation of the regulatory function from the rest of the NQI activities. 
Another is t hat standards setting bodies are often government agencies with little industry sponsorship or 
participation and ownership, particularly from the manufacturing sector which is most impacted. Internationally, 
best practice offers a different approach to NQI . WTO guidelines are that  standards developed by national standards 
bodies should always be voluntary, while technical regulations developed by the state should be limited to concerns 
of safety, health and the environment. For instance, in the EU all standards developed by nationa l standards bodies 
and by the EU’s regional standards bodies are voluntary. These bodies have a high degree of institutional autonomy, 
and standards development is an open consensus -based process that includes producers, consumers,  academics 
and the public  sector  21 
 have dangerous and som etimes fatal consequences. It is in areas like this that perhaps new 
technologies like blockchain can be useful.    
 
Lack of integration of postal services with border agenci es 
Generally , the level of integration between customs and postal operators has be en low. Although  
good integration exists in some countries ( for example, Germany ), this is not true for most of the 
developing world. Globally, the Universal Postal Union ( UPU) has made some efforts to help 
postal operators improve this integrat ion with bo rder authorities. One such  effort is the 
development  of a  Customs Declaration System (CDS) to  manage and capture customs 
declarations and process EDI messages between postal and customs  offices . Because  many postal 
operators lack automation, t he CDS provid es an opportunity for them to begin processing 
transactions electronically and attempt to perform selectivity, risk management , and duty 
calculations  (UPU 2015)  that will st rengthen integration with Customs . However, besides system 
integration with the CDS , much  more needs to be done, particularly for shipments in the e -
commerce world.  
The integration with c ustoms authorities is also important from the point of view of reven ue 
collection and compliance management. Despite the  discussion of whether  de minimis rates for 
package delivery should be levied (see the section on de minimis ), duties  and taxes where 
applicable need to be collected. Customs authorities that run risk man agement rely on collecting 
data from compliant operators , and the level of complian ce from postal operators varies . A 
recent study conducted by the Copenhagen Institute (Basalisco, Wahl, and Okholm 2016) 
highlighted some challenges such as  incomplete levyi ng of the value added tax ( VAT) and import 
duty on postal shipments into the EU . The study  estimated the resulting  loss to European public 
sector income of up to 1.3 billion  euros ( €) per year because c ustoms collected VAT for only 35 
percent of items  shipped through postal services  compared to 98 percent by private express 
companies  (Basalisco, Wahl, and Okholm 2016) . Proposed solutions include  imposing either a 
push -back compliance responsibility to service p roviders or additional fees  on provision of public 
services to respond to increased cost incurred by government -owned or -operated postal 
carriers . There has been a lot of discussion on this in the Australian context, with discussion  about 
who should have the burden to assess and collect revenue t hat is then forwarded to the 
authorities.  
Need to improve air connectivity and performan ce 
Although  e-commerce delivery before the last mile uses a mix of the various transport modes 
(ship, air, and land), the importance of air cargo cannot be over emphasiz ed. Given the time -
sensitive nature (and sometimes high value) of goods and the need for  e-commerce companies 
to compete with brick and mortar retail, the availability of air cargo is crucial. As such, for many 
air cargo  companies ( whether traditional including those carrying cargo in passenger plain bellies , 
integrators or postal operators14), market access through traffic rights and , in turn,  the 
requirement for a more liberal air cargo market , are quite important. Where such markets do  not 
                                                      
14 http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/stb/Documents/StB -Cargo -White -Paper -e-commerce.pdf  22 
 exist, the opportunity for e -commerce to develop may  be limited. Related to air cargo 
liberalization is  the need for the sector stakeholders to use modern practices. In many developing 
countries, cargo terminals are not fully automated or are not integrat ed with airline systems. 
Cargo documentation is mainly  manual , and end -to-end visibility in the tracking  process  is absent  
and clearance at the border is impacted by this (see Figure 5)15. Although discussions on air 
transport and the transport sector in ge neral are beyond  the scope of this note , considering  their 
importance to improving the logistics of e -commerce  is worthwhile .  
Figure 5: Average days for clearance of Air Cargo at international borders by Region, 2017

Poor reach of  logistics  services in  remote areas  
Remote areas in developing countries often lack access to crucial logistics services, infrastructure , 
and delivery systems , which affects  their ability to benefit from e -commerce. According to UPU 
data, more than 90 perce nt of citizens worldwide can potentially receive goods via postal 
services, but in Africa and Ocean ia, th is figure drops to under 40 percent.  In Africa and Oceana, 
parcels are commonly received  at the post office.  However , more than 10 percent of the 
popul ation in both regions lacks  access to home delivery or pick up at a post office  (UNCTAD 
2015) . This is discussed further in the section s on connecting to remote markets  and postal 
services .  
                                                      
15 Amsterdam (Schipol airport), an d Wilmington (USA) are tw o examples of airports that have become hubs for cross 
border commerce in the west ( Supply Chain Brian, 2018) . 
23 
 Policy challenges created by exponentially advancing technologies  in last mile logistics  
The traditional logistics model has been impacted  with the advent of the I nterne t and e -
commerce. The traditional multimodal transport system (air, ship , and truck) shipped specific 
cargo based on volume, size, delivery priority , and value. Although  these characteristics are still 
relevant  for traditional commercial shipments , the e -commerce focus on high volumes of small 
packages has led to an increase in  small package express couriers, a rapid increase in express 
post, and less -than- full container loads. Increasingly, a large part of the success of e -commerce 
will be shaped by how lo gistics provision is enabled efficiently and in a low -cost manner for 
consumers. The challenges facing a scale  up, particularly in developing countries , are manifold 
and include developing logistics infrastructure, modernizing outdated or nonexistent regul ation s 
and policies, enabling connectivity in remote locations , and, most  important , creating more 
efficient last mile logistics in urban areas where most e -commerce customers reside. Current 
conditions in last mile logistics in both developed and developi ng economies and the continued 
growth of e -commerce together suggest  that policy  makers ’ failure to  keep up with innovations, 
trends , and developments affecting  last mile delivery systems may adversely influence  e-
commerce growth. Although  the market will, to a large extent , shape e -commerce companies ’ 
operating structure for l ogistics delivery, government policy and regulations can alter  the 
direction of investment.  Ensur ing that sector policies are modern, transparent , and simplified is 
critical in the me dium term.   
Building B locks for Facilitating C ross-Border 
E-Commerce  
Discussion of t he building blocks in this section aim s to identify those issues that,  although  
applicable more generally to facilitation and logistics , have a particularly important bearing on e -
commerce. Improvement programs for creating a mor e conducive legal environment for 
automation ; improving automation and interconnectivity between agencies ; implementing 
simplified procedures to trade , including for e -commerce ; and implementing ful ly the WTO’s 
Trade Facilitation Agreement are some of thos e issues that affect trade facilitation generally but 
are also crucial for e -commerce and serve as its building blocks. At a minimum, t hese building 
blocks would improve countries ’ abilities to part icipate and benefit from e -commerce.  
Legal Environment for  Automation  
The enabling legal environment for automation need s to be addressed at an economywide level. 
However, trade facilitation reform brings the  need  to light and puts it in context, acting as  a 
catalyst for addressing  the overall legal framework, particularly during the implementation of 
automation systems like electronic single windows and port community systems.  For developing 
countries, setting up the enabling legal and regulatory framework  also requires investing in new 
institutional mechanisms , including those  that enable electronic record management and 
archiving, provide legal certainty and basis for electronic messages, create and empower entities 
that can emit electronic signatures, pu t in place systems for pro tection of data, and work with 24 
 the banking sector to enable electronic receipts and notices of payments.  These are discussed in 
turn as follows . 
Other factors affecting  the legal environment for automation and e -commerce include t he legal 
tradition and attitude toward regulations , enabling laws , and liability issues.  Some of this effect 
is dependent on the prevailing or historical economic model, the quality of governance and rule 
of law , and the political commitment. However, thes e factors also affect  gene ral law making and 
are not discussed further in this note . 
Data protection and privacy 
Data protection is a critical enabler for constructing a safe environment for using an online 
service, buying a product online, registering for  email, making payments , or providing personal 
information online.  Traders and consumers can have confidence in using online services only  
through strong data protection regulations  that avoid  government abuse and company 
surveillance of consumer habits. More than  107 countries have passed laws to protect citizens’  
data, but many countries still require robust safeguards to protect citizens and consumers from 
misuse of personal information by g overnment and business.  Only 66 developing countries have 
passed  data protection laws.  Most governments realize that data protection is necessary, but 
comprehensive data protection law s that appl y to all business sectors and to government are not 
yet devel oped.  Adopting and enforcing privacy and data protection laws is  a key factor in bridging 
the so-called  digital divide, particularly as business and government adopt new technologies such 
as cloud computing  (Privacy International n.d.) . 
Privacy Internation al (n.d.)  defines  data protection “as the law designed to protec t your personal 
information, which is collected, processed and stored by ‘ automated ’ means or intended to be 
part of a filing system.” Data protection laws should encompass the following basic  principles:  
• Limits on the collection of personal information  
• Collection of information that is  relevant to the purpose intended and used for agreed 
purposes  
• Rules about disclosure of personal information (with the consent of the individual)  
• Storage of in formation in a secure space with security safeguards  
• Limits and rules on who has access to the information  
• Accountability for providing rights noted above by t he entity that collects and stores 
information  
International trade  leads to  data being sent  acros s borders  possibly to  countries that have limited 
data protectio n. For data that move across borders, guidelines have been created to support an 
international framework that ensure s data security  (map 1). Countries or regions ( for example , 
the E U) that have strong privacy and trade confidentiality laws will often consider the legal 
protections, as well as technical security measures , when embarking on systems and tools that 
enable cross -border trade, particularly in an e -commerce environment. The E U’s 19 95 Data 
Protection Directive is the most comprehensive data protect ion regulation to date  (European 
Parliament and Council 1995) . It standardizes laws across E U member states  to facilitate trade 
within the European market. The d irective stipulates that dat a can be sent to non- EU countries 
only if those countries have data  protection laws , which can have implications for trade . Canada 25 
 also has good practice examples ; it has  two pieces of legislation that relate to government and 
the private sector and additional laws at the provincial level. The OECD  (1980)  Guidelines on the 
Protection of Privacy  and Transborder Flows of Personal Data , agreed upon in 1980 and updated 
in 2013, also outline data protection principles.  The most robust international legal instrum ent is 
the Council of Europe 1981 Convention for the Protection of Individuals about  the Automatic 
Processing of Personal Data. Non -European countries can ratify  it, but it has had limited uptake 
to date. Another example is the Safe Harbor Framework developed by the U.S. Department of 
Commerce and the European Commission,  a voluntary, self -regulatory framework  that enables 
U.S. firms to engage in data transfers be tween the EU and the United States  and to process data 
on EU citizens.  In 2016, the Safe Harbor Framework was replaced by the EU -U.S. and Swiss -U.S. 
Privacy Shield Framework s as a valid legal mechanism to comply with EU and Swiss requirements 
on the  transf er of personal data from the EU and Switzerland  to the United States. It is a voluntary

Developing countries attempting to create data protection laws try to follow be st practice and 
often opt to be consistent with the EU d irective.  They face challenges in terms of the cost to 
enforce data protection laws and the lack of public and private se ctor knowledge and 
cooperation  on the issue . Lack of data protection regimes ca n raise trader concerns about 
integrity of payment system s and fraud. For cross -border e -commerce trade, research has 
26 
 revealed that consumers in developing countries are worried  about the use of their personal 
data.  However, o verly strict data protection laws can restrict activities such as investment, 
innovation,  and emergence of new technologies  (UNCTAD 2016a) .  
There are also specific guidelines for data protection in terms of  tools that enable cross -border 
trade. For example, Recommendation No. 35 by th e United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation 
and Electronic Business  includes a discussion of the issue of data protection about  protecting 
information and data within a s ingle window from unauthorized access or dissemination, noting  
that this is vital ly importan t (UN CEFACT 2010 , annex II ). Technical and legal issue s are related to 
this aspect,  and data protection can be particularly important for a cross -border single window 
environment. Regarding  the legal dimension, issues of information security (for example, the 
various technical measures for protecting information and  data) and data protection will 
intersect with those related to trade confidentiality and privacy laws.  For online trade 
transactions, data that require security and protection include financial information used in 
connection with the collection of duties,  taxes, and fees  and sensitive (and even classified) law 
enforcement information used primarily by government officials to enforce a wide variety of civil 
and criminal laws (for example , ensuring food safety and public health and combating smuggling, 
terrorism, money laundering , and narcotics trafficking ). Thus, ensuring appropriate protection of 
this type of data and information is fundamental to protecting the information assets of the  
government as well as those of private sect or participants in cross -border trade and e -commerce . 
Legal validity for e lectronic transactions  
Providing legal validity for electronic transactions is a precondition for enabling e -commerce.  E-
Transaction laws  provide  electronic transactions with the sa me legal equivalence as paper- based 
transactions.  Several international organizations have been involved in the development of 
international legal standards for enabling electronic commerce.  Without the adoption of such 
standards, traders lack legal certainty and legal validity for e -commerce transactions.  Therefore , 
countries must adopt a robust electronic transactions law that will enable the electronic aspects 
of trade transactions. Such a law should provide fo r both electronic commerce types of 
transact ions ( for example , B2B, B2C, and consumer -to-business  transactions) and electronic 
transactions within the context of government transactions ( that is , government -to-government , 
business- to-government, and govern ment -to-business  transactions).   
The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)16 has completed an 
important international convention17 and two m odel laws18 that provide important benchmarks

17 The United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts was adopted by the UN 
General Assembly on November 23, 2005. See Resolution Adopted by the General Assembl y [on the report of the Sixth 
Committee (A/60/515)] 6 0/21. United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International 
Contracts, Official Records of the General Assembly, 60th Session, A/RES/60/21 . Six countries have ratified this c onvention 
and 18 have signed it . The c onvention enter ed into force on March 1, 2013. The c onvention and an explanatory note by the

 for international standards in the field of ele ctronic transacti ons law. The United Nations 
Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts , known as the 
UN Electronic Communications Convention, provides international legal standards for electronic 
transactions in its subs tantive provision s (Articles 4 –14). It also provides a vehicle in Article 20 of 
the convention whereby a ratifying country  can decide to apply the e -transaction provisions of 
the convention to a wide range of earlier treaties and international agreements t o which that 
coun try may be a party. This approach permits a ratifying country  to extend the reach of its legal 
framework for electronic transactions to other types of international transactions.  To date, 145 
countries have adopted such laws  (map 2; box 1 ). Africa has the most countries  that have lagged 
in the adoption of such  laws.  In addition, UNCITRAL developed the Model Law on Electronic 
Commerce (1996), which has been widely used as the framework for enactment of domestic 
electronic commerce law. Provisions of this UNCITRAL Model Law have been enacted or have 
inspired legislation  in at least 60 countries and in many territories and dependencies as well. 
Some countries  have also used the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Signatures (2001) for 
guidance on domestic law in this area.19

 Box 1: Zambia’s E lectronic Communications and Transactions  Act 
The Electronic Communications and Transactions Act of 2009  (ECT Act) (Government of Zambia 
2009)  provides the underlying framework for Zambia to enable electronic transactions  for trade 
transactions and e -commerce . It is similar to the type of enabling law that other countries have 
enacted to allow government ministries and agencies in volved in the i mport, export , and transit 
of goods to use  electronic data messages, electronic filing of documents, licenses and approvals, 
and payment systems even though a particular ministry’s specific enabling law does not provide 
for the use of electr onic modalities  in its operations.  The ECT Act covers issues related to the legal 
requirements for a data message  (Section 4), electronic documents as “writings” when required 
by law  (Section 5), electronic signatures (including digital signatures)  (Sectio n 6), the admis sibility 
of data messages as  evidence (Section 8), and data retention  (Section 9). Section 12 of the ECT 
Act appears  to permit the use of one data message to meet the requirements for filing in cases 
where a law requires multiple copies. It also appears to mandate that an “ expression in a law … 
including the words ‘document’, ‘record ’, ‘file’, ‘submit’, ‘lodge ’, ‘deliver’, ‘issue ’, ‘publish ’, ‘write 
in’, ‘print ’ or words or expressions of similar effec t ….” include data messages.a Further, th e ECT 
Act provides for a wide variety of additional legal issues regarding electronic transactions such as 
consumer protection in electronic transactions  (Part VI) , the protection of personal information 
in electron ic transactions  (Part VII) , database prot ection  (Part VIII) , and a series of criminal law 
provisions (including “Cyber Crimes”)  (Parts XI, XII, and XV).  
a. The full text of Section 12 is as follows:  
(1) A requirement in a law for multiple copies of a docum ent to be submitted to a single addressee at the same time 
shall be satisfied by the submission of a single data message that is capable of being reproduced by that addressee.  
(2) An expression in a law, whether used as a noun or verb, including the words “ document ”, “record ”, “file”, 
“submit ”, “lodge ”, “deliver ”, “issue ”, “publish” , “write in ”, “print ” or words or expressions of similar effect, shall be 
interpreted so as to include or permit such form, format or action in relation to a data message unless otherwise 
provided for in this Act.  
 
Use of electronic  signatures, certification authorities, and mutual recognition  
Digital signatures provide legal certainty on the validity of a contract , which is critical for e -
commerce transactions. Electronic signature  is the broad term that encompasses various types 
of signatures in electronic formats and the methods used to create them. The primary purpose 
for these types of signatures is to provide, in some sense, the equivalent to handwritten 
signatures and other types of devices (for example, seals and rubber signatu re stamps) used in 
the paper environment for authenticating such signatures.20 Because  contracts in the e -

 commerce space are paperless, digital signatures provide integrity for an electronic contract and 
make it binding21. Thus, developing stan dards to ensure the security and reliability of digital 
signatures  is essential . Over 60 countries have adopted some form of electronic signature law  
(Electronic Signature Authority 2011) . Mutual recognition of certification authorities (who certify 
certain digital signatures) may be important in cross -border transactions where a country has 
decided to use a specific  type of digital signature for cross -border transactions.  However, t wo 
countries may have different standards ’ or certification authorities,  and this is  often seen as a 
difficulty  when it is not really the case . For instance, c ountry A would not send a document across 
borders if it did not comply with its own standards. To accept the document in its jurisdiction 
Country B simply needs to have mutual recog nition – not of the actual digital signatures –  but of 
the process to generate the document.  If the process does not involve a digital signature it’s just 
as good. This is the approach ASEAN has taken to the exchange of electronic COOs (e -Form D)  
where th ere is no central certification authority or agreed digital signature standard.  
UNCITRAL (2009) has prepared an extensive guidance document related to electronic signatures 
titled “Promoting Confidence in Electronic Commerce: Legal Issues on Inter national Use of 
Electronic Authentication and Signature Methods .” The various  texts provide important 
underlying legal principles in  electronic commerce and electronic transactions for international 
trade.  In its guidance document, UNCITRAL (2 009, para. 16 ) defines  several broad categories of 
electronic signatures and authentication methods:  
• Electronic signatures can be  based on the knowledge of the user or the recipient, for 
example, a person knowing certain passwords or personal identification numbers (PI Ns). 
Thes e might include clickable “OK” or “I confirm” boxes used on secure websites where 
the user has already logged in using a password or  PIN. 
• E-signatures can be  based on the physical features of the user, for example, biometrics 
that require  an indiv idual’s h andwritten signature using a digital pen on a digitizing pad.   
• E-signatures  can be  based on the possession of an object (sometimes called a “token”) by 
the user ( for example, the codes or other information stored on a magnetic card ).  
• Other variou s types o f authentication and signature methods might also be used to 
indicate the originator of an electronic communication such as a facsimile of a 
handwritten signature or a name typed at the bottom of an electronic message or email.  
Ideally, g ood prac tice legislation should  not favor specific technolog ies even if driven by security 
concerns (that is,  requiring a specific authentication for a n automation  system ) because  this 
approach drives up  costs. The type of electronic signature required should  be b ased on the level 
                                                      
Adopted by the General Assembly [on the report of the Sixth Committee (A/60/515)] 60/21; United Nations Convention

21 In some  legal systems (e.g. English law) most contracts are binding even without a signature as long as the intent can be 
demonstrated and the same applies to the electronic world. Oft en, the lack of a PKI i nfrastructure to support digital 
signatures is cited as an excuse for  not moving to an electronic environment where, in fact, ‘intent’ is implicit in an electronic 
record that could only have been generated through a duly authorized process.

 of security that is needed for a transaction . Not all transactions require the highest level of 
security , which may carry very high costs. For example, digital signatures  at one of the highest 
level s of security  are those created usi ng asymmetric cryptography ( such as that used in public 
key infrastructure methods ) combined with certification of the signatures by a third party (usually 
called a “trusted third party.”) Digital s ignatures are a subset of electronic signatures , and the 
name u sually is given to technological applications that use asymmetric cryptography  (UNCITRAL 
2009, paras. 24– 52). The choice of the electronic  signature or signature systems will depend on 
a variety of factors. One factor is  national policy decisions abou t the  use of electronic signatures 
in electronic commerce, particularly as established in a country’s electronic transactions law and 
partly related to the desired level of security needed for risks ass ociated with transactions . A 
further consideration may  be free trade agreements  that typically require technology neutrality.  
Data retention and e lectronic archiving  
Retaining records and filings is an important aspect of trade facilitation generally  and no less 
important in the electronic environment . In additi on, its legal aspects need to be addressed ; that 
is, archived data must be  secure and maintained in a form and format that will be legally 
enforceable later . Storage of electronic data is critical for e -commerce because it allows legal 
documents to be archived in an electronic environment that can be accessed by multiple parties 
for legal purposes  even if they are in different countries . Establishing the necessary regulatory 
framework for data retention and electronic archiving anticip ates decisions on seve ral legal 
issues.  For example, many countries have created  data retention schedules for certain types of 
information. This framework includes distinctions between data related to regulatory filings and 
data involving personally identifiable information. In  the latter case, governments will sometimes 
define the maximum time for which such data may be retained and then require that they be  
destroyed. Customs a dministrations often have criteria for retention of information and data in 
the paper environment. D epending on national policies, these criteria can also be adapted 
through regulations for t he electronic environment.  
Electronic archiving —the storage of e lectronic data and information —covers a wide range of 
areas. For example, it inc ludes the definition o f the formats in which data will be stored  and the  
requirements of national law such as those dealing with original  documents  that might be needed 
for subsequent use in an enforcement proceeding or in relation to possible civil disputes or, on a 
short time frame, in post -clearance audit procedures. An important issue here will be the choice 
of the technology used  for data storage, which will be based on the legal requirements for its 
subsequent use, for example, as evidence in a legal proceeding.  
Access to a nd sharing of data  
Laws and regulations providing for the access to and sharing of trade data information (including 
customs data) among  government agencies and between government and traders should be 
considered. For example, whether one governmental org anization is legally permitted to share 
data and information with another or, conversely, to provide such information to an other 
governme ntal organization  is unclear. Further, privacy or confidentiality laws or regulations in 
some countries prohibit the sharing of certain types of information among  government 
organizations except when permitted by law. These issues should also be reviewed i n the context 31 
 of possible cross- border transactions. In many countries, cross -border access and sharin g 
considerations have had to be authorized in national law before information can be shared or 
exchanged with another customs administrati on or with another country . Other countries will 
need to know that data sharing is legally permitted within a trading partner country t o ensure 
that processed transactions have legal validity.  Storage of data on a cloud or on a server in a third 
country also becomes probl ematic.  
Many businesses face restrictive laws and regulations when attempting to store and transfer data 
across countr y borders.  For example, Norwegian law prevents the collection and storage of 
Norwegian customers’ social security numbers. This practice means businesses engaged in cross-
border e -commerce must  find creative ways around this problem, and the issue  becomes more 
problematic when acquir ing credit history reports without a social security number (National 
Board of Trade, Sweden 2012) . 
 
Simplify ing Trade -Related Regulations and P rocedures in E-Commerce  
The movement of goods across borders is aligned to support big businesses, and customs regimes 
provide facilitation measures that are more tailored to big business. Often countries find dealing 
with small consignments challenging for multiple reasons, including the amount of resources 
required, particularly where automation is not fully deployed; potential loss in revenue, 
especially from false declarations; prevalence of under- invoicing; large number of unknown 
players (vendors and consignees) involved; and security, particularly in environments where 
contraband a nd illicit goods are a challenge. However, some specific facilitation measures that 
improve the efficiency of trade transactions can significantly affect e -commerce and SMEs that 
are trying to take advantage of it (The Economist Intelligence Unit 2014). These include customs 
practices that mandate the use of a de minimis threshold and pre -arrival processing that enable 
customs and other government agencies to conduct their clearance and transactional processes 
online. VAT in the EU raises another issue –  the multiplicity of rates impacts the ability of SMEs 
who don’t use a platform to reach customers to be competitive.  Similarly, having a simplified 
declarations regime for low -value shipments helps small traders move their goods faster. 
Facilitation for prov iding evidence around rules of origin also needs to be in place so that 
providing certification is not overly costly for small traders. E -commerce goods are  time sensitive 
and require advance information and online processing. Stakeholders need to be engag ed to 
ensure greater compliance, and political will to make decisions that enable simplified solutions is 
important. A detailed discussion on this follows below.  Table 2 shows the application of some of 
these measures in selected countries.

Simplified regimes  
Traders could be provided different types  of simplified procedures that make the declaration 
process less complex and easier to prepare and present to border agency officials.  One 
mechanism used frequently by c ustoms agencies is the streamlined customs clearance procedure 
that enable s traders to use a simpler customs declaration document. Such a procedure can be 
used for low -value shipments and goods that need to be expedited (perishables or small parcels 
delivered by express couriers).  The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa  (COMESA ) 
provides an example.  It has offered a simplified customs clearance procedure for its member 
33 
 countries —the COMESA Simplified Trade Regime (STR) —that is employed by small- scale traders 
to facilitate their import and expor t documents  (Zimbabwe Reven ue Authority 2014) . Currently , 
the STR is applied to goods that have been grown or  are wholly produced in the COMESA r egion  
and appear on the STR’s Common List. In addition, to the streamlined procedure described 
earlier, g oods need to  comply with the norm al food safety, plant , and animal health regulations  
and may still require any import or export permits . The STR allows for faster clearance times at 
border posts, reduced clearance costs, and predictability of duties levied . The  STR is meant to be 
used by small -scale cross -border traders exporting goods valued at US$1 ,000 or less per 
consignment. A key improvement to this procedure would be to integrate other border agencies 
(such as those for quarantine and food safety) and stre amline their procedu res to improve the 
benefits  overall. Currently, t he STR provides the following benefits:  
• A simplified certificate of origin . The certificate  should be signed and stamped by a 
customs official at the border post for all goods that appear on the Common List.  
• A simplified customs document . Traders are supposed to declare goods that appear on 
the Common List , and duty is not payable on the declared goods.  
• A common list of qualifying goods . The Common List will be in the gazette  of each membe r 
state and be notified to the public . Once in the gazette, the Common List will also be 
displayed at all border posts within COMESA.  
A simplified regime for e -commerce that builds on aspects of COMESA’s STR could be developed 
for developing country enviro nments.  
The Korea Cu stoms Service (KCS) of the Republic of Korea has introduced streamlined import and 
export clearance procedures for goods bought online.  For imports, KCS has created a list 
clearance process  in which the declaration requires 26 data poin ts rather than  the 69 data points 
required in a general declaration.  Commercial samples or g oods bought for personal use with a 
free on-board  price under US $200 are tax exempt.  Goods bought online are provided rapid 
clearance . Complet ion of  customs clearan ce of expedite d cargo that is submitted under the list 
clearance procedures through the e -clearance system (UNIPASS)  reportedly takes less than four 
hours . For exports, a simplified export declaration for e -commerce requires 37 data points,  
reduced from 57  data points.  To help traders that are not used to dealing with standardized data 
requirements, KCS has set up a Harmonized System Navigation service that traders can use to 
identify the correct H armonized System  code by searching the product name.  To faci litate e -
comme rce exporters, KCS has begun to archive e -commerce export data of goods sent by post al 
operators.  It uses these  data to issue certifications of export so that traders can receive VAT 
refunds and access trade finance.  Pre-clearance procedures are also available to e -commerce 
goods sent by the postal operators  (WCO 2015 a). 
In Latin America, another approach is being tested with waiver of clearance requirements for 
small packages. In Brazil, the introduction of simplified customs procedures in 19 99 for goods 
under a certain weight and value ha s increased the number of exporters by 11,000 and increased 
the number of shipments by more than 120,000.  The value of exports under this simplified 
regime w as US$272 million in 2012 (The Economist Intelligence Unit 2014) . In Finland, V enue, an 
online system  for importing or exporting e -commerce goods , allows traders to make an 
incomplete advanced declaration up  to a certain value for faster processing. The Global Express 34 
 Association  (2016)  notes that today le ss than 50 countries have simplified entry thresholds , six 
of those  countries apply it for postal agencies only, three  countries for personal use  or 
noncommercial use, and one  country for gift use. Further , no common threshold exists, and the 
value  for sim plified entry can range  from US$14 to US $11,000, though half the countries that 
apply it have thresholds lower than US $500 (GEA 2016) . 
Another facilitation mechanism that would be of value for developing countries is the use of 
informal entry provisions, u sed currently by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).  
Informal entries do not require a posting of a bond, and clearance is immediate upon payment 
of duties. This approach  can be used for imports that are valued under US$2,500. Informal entry 
enab les a trader to use simplified clearance forms and does not require the use of a customs 
broker.  However, informal entries are not tax exempt  (CBP 2015) . Despite the ease that info rmal 
entries offer , many developing countries are quite reluctant to use such provisions. Valuation is 
often a significant  problem because  customs duty and taxes and fees collected at the border are 
a significant part of total national revenue and an expre ss courier manifest sometimes can be 
used to avoid customs duty. Fraud, cons ignment splitting, and counterfeits are particularly more 
difficult  to detect in these countries given the lack of resources and nascent application of risk 
management techniques.  
A simplified return procedure is often essential for e -commerce companies to  operate profitably, 
but few countries  offer such benefits . In many countries , the cost  of returning goods  bought 
online , including filing paperwork, and recouping  fees and duties can be quite onerous.  According 
to a company in a Turkish survey, it  typical ly handled 50 returns for every 150 products sold,  
adding significant costs to its  operations  (National Board of Trade, Sweden 2012) . Such costs 
become more expensive for e -traders that ship their goods over borders if they must  pay logistics 
costs for ret urned goods  and obtain refunds for duty  paid . In Turkey, a  seller must  pay all costs 
incurred for returns, which can become fairly exp ensive without  expedited procedures or 
exemptions.  Often, many companies choose to forgo collecting returns because it is  
uneconomic al. A company in Sweden stated that returns often result in payment of 500 Swedish 
kronor in customs duties and shipping cos ts. To circumvent such costs, some companies choose 
to invest in bonded warehouses in the destination country to avoid add ressing customs 
procedures and duties for e -commerce goods  (National Board of Trade, Sweden 2012) . One 
solution  is to provide  selected  businesses with simplified procedures and duty -free treatment for 
returned goods , which  is currently offered by Swedish C ustoms  (National Board of Trade, Sweden 
2012),  though this is not a common practice .  
De minimis  
Guideline 11 of the ICC Customs Guidelines (ICC 2012) defines “ de minimis ” as a valuation ceiling 
for goods, including documents and trade samples, below which no duty or tax is charged and 
clearance procedures, including data requirements, are minimal.  According to Transitional 
Standard 4.13 of the Kyoto Convention (WCO 2000) , customs administrations can determine “ a 
minimum value and/ or minimum amount of dutie s and taxes below which no duties and taxes 
will be collected. ” Goods that fall within that thres hold can also enjoy lower documentary 
requirements. Administrations implementing a de m inimis regime can also apply  the WCO ’s 
(2014) Guidelines for the Immediate Release of Consignments by Customs , which enable s the  35 
 immediate release goods using a consolid ated declaration that can be a manifest, waybill, cargo 
declaration , or inventory of goods. The WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement  (Article 7) calls for 
the us e of de minim is thresholds  to facilitate expedited shipments.  
From the perspective  of promoting e -commerce , current de minimis levels in most countries are 
probably too low  (map 3) . Governments in many developin g countries fear that raising the de 
minimis  levels will result in  loss of revenue, because  customs duties  and fees from trade 
transactions can often account for 20 –60 percent  of government revenue. Governments need to 
evaluate whether  the collection of duties on low -value goods is worth the effort to achieve 
revenue targets . Government agencies need to weigh the costs associated with the collection of 
VAT and import duties against the actual value of duties collect ed for low -value shipments 
because  the cost of collecting those duties can often excee d the revenue generated  in some 
countries . In such cases, r esources could be better spent elsewhere to ensure focus on  sources 
that yield higher revenue.  For government, logistics operators, importers , and consumers, in 
many cases, raising the de minimis  threshold could reduce the cost for all parties involved and  
reduce time to trade  (see table 3) .

Raising de minimis levels can often positive ly affect  SMEs . Tax exemption and simpler clearance 
procedures  would dramatically reduce the cost of clearance procedures . Because SMEs face 
higher costs owing  to their business and sourcing practices , they tend to import and export small 
consignments.  Low de minimis levels elevate the cost of compliance  for small consignments, thus 
raising the price s of production and final goods for  SMEs.  For SMEs participating in global value 
chains, this is particularly relevant because  intermediate products often  cross many borders 
before  they become final products.  Raising de minimis levels could lower cross -border costs . For 
SMEs, a higher d e minimis threshold may also  reduce the ir reliance on customs brokers  because  
often they rely on intermed iaries to process customs and other government agency clearance 
procedures.  In Surinam,  traders complained about the same  high costs for customs brokers, 
particularly for low -value shipments  bought online . According to estimates by the Peterson 
Institute  (Hufbauer and Wong 2011) , the 3.8 million shipments that fall under the US $800 range 
managed annually  by the U.S Postal Service ( USPS ) would produce a net gain ( determined by the 
value of time saved to customers, plus cost savings to express firms, USPS, an d CBP, minus loss 
of tariff revenue)  of US$17 million if  the de minim is threshold  were raised  to US$1,000. The 
United States  eventually  change d rules in March 2016 by  allowing Americans to import a single 
shipment of most foreign goods  with a total value o f US$800  without having to pay import duties 
or tax ( up from US$200 previously). The Philippines  also raised its de minimus level from $10 to 
$210. On the other hand,  in 2018 Russia reduced its de minimus to Euro 500 to enable Russian 
firms to compete with  foreign imports.  
International returns have also been made easier. Before  this increased amount  of US$800,  a 30  
percent  duty was applicable on single shipments of  imported products with a total value of 37 
 US$200 an d above  (Stevens 2016) . A buyer purchasing costume jewelry for US $201 would have 
to deal with a duty of 110 percent. Express industry exper ts were  gearing up for a much larger 
volume of packages as a result  (Stevens 2016) . However, security and supply chain integrity 
issues may still require  use of  customs brokers. In the United States , the National Customs 
Brokers and Forwarders Association of America lobbied the CBP and the U.S. Department of 
Treasury  after the new de minimis rule was issued to “develop regulations that mandate that all 
goods ente red into the United States are considered ‘customs business,’ thus requiring either the 
direct involvement of the actual importer or a licensed customs broker who is bound under [the 
Trade Facilitatio n and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015]  to validate an impo rter’s identity” and 
argued that “ duty free does not mean data free”  (Johnson 2016) . 
In the EU , for example, the cost to collect the VAT for  de minimis shipments exceeds the revenue 
collected.  Proposa ls suggest  raising the de minimis  threshold to €80 from the current € 22. The 
increase would produce a n estimated  total saving s of €32 million annually . Similarly, in 2005, 
before the de m inimis threshold was raised to 1 ,000 Australian dollars ($A) , the Australian 
Productivity  Commission estimated that a higher de minimis threshold of $A  1,000 would result 
in $A12 million in savings. Recently , Australia change d some rules on the practice with vendors 
who sell more than $A  75,000 of low -value goods that are classified as items sold for less than 
$A 1,000 . Vendors now need to register and collect a goods and services tax  from consumers  and 
then pay this amount to the Australian tax authorities. Trade facilitation is not affected because  
this new rule does not require payment at the border for goods valued a t less than $A  1,000.  
Government views vary on the level at which to set “de minimis” thresholds under which 
duties/charges are not levied, and simplified clearance procedures  apply. Unsurprisingly, the 
international e -commerce industry wants high de minimis thresholds. For example, Australia has 
recently lowered its de minimis for GST collection to $0, meaning all e -commerce imports will 
have GST levied upon them (but not duti es). New Zealand Customs expressed a cautious view 
that it was too early to make  dramatic changes in policy without an understanding of the impact 
on e -commerce, and without the right partnerships being in place between companies involved 
in e-commerce, an d Customs and other government agencies. Various models were presented 
by WCO Me mbers and the by the OECD for collecting revenue on e -commerce shipments, but it 
was not clear whether any existing approaches generate revenue higher than the cost of 
collecti ng that revenue22. 
Policy  makers in developed  economies like the EU , however , face pressure from domestic 
producers and retailers of unfair competition if VAT is included in de minimis practice. Tax 
agencies everywhere fear revenue losses , particularly if a good cost -benefit analysis has not been 
undertaken, and thus  are hesitant to pr ovide VAT relief for low -value goods under the de minimis  
system . If a country’s duty collection process at the border is still manual and paper based, VAT 
exemption is even more unlikely. A vendor collection process like  that just introduced by

 Australia is certainly streamlined because  it does not affect trade facilitation at the border 
negatively . However, it  is likely to require more resources for post -import  control. A second 
approach  is to require consumers to pay  directly to Customs or the tax ag ency, but this has too 
many challenges and is unlik ely to work. A third approach  is to use the delivery companies or 
third- party logistics providers or potentially the marketplaces to collect and remit VAT. In this 
approach, some of the more sophisticated oper ators are more likely to be able to comply  though 
many may not . Postal  operators  in many countries  may have difficulties in complying because  
they are still automating  and modernizing  their services . Overall, the cost -benefit analysis 
shouldn’t just be fro m the perspective of revenue (cost of collection vs revenue raised) but also 
the wider economic impact of lowering consumer prices through e -commerce and  providing 
access to cheaper imported inputs.  
Customs age ncies in many developing countries often perce ive that duties on online  purchases 
are a source of revenue  and that a change in de minimis policy can threaten the achievement of 
revenue goals . According to a Mc Kinsey analysis of Chinese online buyers, nearly one -fifth of the 
digital consumers buy goods  from vendors outside China  because they found the items to o costly 
or in limited supply  domestically  (Wang, Lau, and Gong 2016) . The Chinese government has 
recently formalized import and value  added taxes on c ross-border commerce , which is likely to 
make these goods more expensive . Similarly, the government of Trinidad and Tobago may 
introduce a 7 percent  tax on online purchases of goods and services from companies that reside 
outside the country  and are not ob liged to pay taxes in Trinidad and Tobago . Suc h companies 
include Dell, Walmart, Staples , and Amazon , which  sell and ship products to Trinidad and Tobago 
from the United States . The government states that the rationale for such a tax is to mitigate 
“foreig n exchange outflows from online purchases, reduce revenue leakage and assist local 
manufacturers and service companies to compete with overseas retailers ” (Trinidad and Tobago 
Guardian 2016) . 
The policy implications for countries are important because  de minimis rules vary across 
countries and product  treatment differ s according to value or type of shipment.  This 
differentiation can create distortions and uncompetitive outcomes, favoring one co untry or 
trading partner over another. Although the increased  de minimis  threshold in the United States  
clearly favors consumers, U .S. SMEs now face competition from foreign producers and could be 
adversely affected. R eciprocity among trading partners wher eby de minimis rules in one country 
are respected in another country would alleviate these concerns , such as  between the United 
States  and Canada .23 An agreed de minimis threshold within a trading bloc is another option that 
could reduce price distortion and differentiated treatment. Such an option is being explored in 
the Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation  (APEC ) and the EU.  This regional cooperation on de 
minimis levels might be a better approach –  there is less complexity across different jurisdictions, 
less risk of competition in setting rates, and more confidence given to individual governments 
that they are setting the threshold at the “right” level. This is something that logistics operators 
in APEC ask for at the APEC level.  
                                                      
23 Canada has a de minimis threshold of Can$20 in contrast to  the U .S. de minimis threshold of US$800.  39 
 Globally, members of the WTO ( 2017)  adopted a declaration on glo bal electronic commerce  in 
May 1998 at their Second Minist erial Conference in Geneva that included the statement that 
“members will continue their current practice of not imposing customs duties on electronic 
transmission .” They also agreed to establish a  comprehensive  work program to examine all 
trade -related issues arising from electronic commerce. Since the Fourth Ministerial Conference 
in Doha in 2001, discussions have included “ classification of the content of certain electronic 
transmis sions; development -related issues; fiscal implications of e -commerce; relationship (and 
possible substitution effects) between e -commerce and traditional forms of commerce; 
imposition of customs duties on electronic transmissions; competition; jurisdiction  and 
applicable law/other legal issues ” (WTO 2017) . Some regional trade agreements have also begun 
formalizing ‘no customs duties. The Recent EU Canada trade agreement i mposes a permanent 
moratoriu m on customs duties, fees or charges for digital products t ransmitted electronically 
between Canada and the EU24.  
The private sector has attempted to advocate  against both tax and nontax measures that restrict 
e-commerce.  Typically , this advocacy is conducted through chambers of commerce, freight 
forwarders , and express associations at the national, regional, and global levels . Prominent 
marketplaces also have tried to highlight the issues. Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba , has 
encouraged G-20 (Group of Twenty) nations to create digital free  trade zones  to reduce the cost 
of trade regulations for small businesses. Ma states that current trade facilitation practices are 
geared toward large businesses that can manage complex regulat ory and market- entry 
requirements. He believes these digital free trade zones could enable small businesses to sell 
their products internationally without having their consumers incur high costs related to import 
duties and cumbersome customs clearance  (King 2016b) . 
 
Simplif ying compliance for rules of origin  
Rules of origin certification can also be burdensome for companies, particularly SMEs engaged in 
cross -border e -commerce. Because  cross border e -traders typically engage in small consignments 
to many  countries, providing certific ates of origin becomes more expensive for them  than for 
traditional traders that deal with fewer countries and larger consignments. Transport regulations 
can also limit the storage of goods to a specific  location to comply wit h rules of origin for 
products . As a result, some traders must  invest in local warehouses in their export market 
country, which reduces the bureaucratic hassles but creates another source of cost all together. 
For small traders, this may not be an option and may limit access to markets  considerably  
(National Board of Trade, Sweden 2012) . Countries have introduced t wo initiatives to simplify 
rules of origin : self-certification and e -certification.  Both tools could dramatically reduce the 
bureaucratic procedures applicable to  rules of origin certification and support e -commerce 
traders in their ability to comply with rules of origin . 
                                                      
24 However CETA allows for internal taxes and charges on digital products transmitted electronically, provided those taxes 
and charges are consistent with CETA’s other chapters . 40 
 Often countries impose burdensome formalities and documentation requirements for 
confirming rules of origin. Importers in Ethiop ia are required to submit a co nsiderable number of 
documents to process regulatory formalities with c ustoms and other regulatory agencies. T he 
Ethiopian Revenue s and Customs Authority requires the additional formality of  a chamberized 
invoice  from Ethiopian importers . Chamberization is  merely an act of obtaining a stamp and seal 
of a c hamber of c ommerce , often done to certify the authenticity of a shipping  document. The 
importer is then required to pay a  service fee , which varies from place to place but can often be 
as much as US$ 150. T he rationale behind chamberization is the involve ment of an independent 
third party to verify the authenticity of a shipping  or trading document. Although  this appears to 
be a noble objective, the safeguard mechanisms for  guarantee ing the authenticity of a n invoice 
are no better in many chambers of commerce than in  the authorities in the importing nation. 
Given that chambers of commerce do not physically inspect the goods in most cases, they cannot, 
for instance, assure that the prices indicated in the invo ice reflect the true value of the goods and 
that no under - or over -invoicing  is occurring . This situation makes chamberization of invoices a 
superfluous procedure and merely add s a transaction cost for importers  and increas es prices for 
consumers . This formality is even more burdensome  because it is enforceable on all Ethiopian 
imports covering all products and regardless of origin of the good s, but SMEs may have the 
biggest burden. For companies engaged in e -commerce , cham berization would probably be a 
deal breaker.  
Self-Certification  
Self-certification is generally good for trade, not just for e -commerce, but its effect on SMEs and 
e-commerce is likely to be significant.  Some countries have begun exploring self -certification 
schemes that allow a  producer,  exporter , or importer to issue origin certificates. Self -certification 
eliminates intervention by additional agencies , but its effectiveness relies on customs or tax 
agen cies to ensure verification of compliance. In the United States , self -certification p rocedures 
depend  on customs being able to conduct risk analysis to verify and ensure the origination point 
of its preferential imports  (UNCTAD 2011) . The WTO (2013a ) Minis terial Decision of December 7 , 
2013, on the Preferential Rules of Origin for Least -Developed Countries  stated  in paragraph 1.8 : 
“The documentary requirements regarding compliance with the rules of origin should be simple 
and transparent. For instance, requirement to provide proof of non- manipulation or any other 
prescribed form for a certification of origin for products shipped from [least developed countries]  
across other Members may be avoided. Regarding  certification of rules of origin, whenever 
possible, self -certification may be recognized. Mutual customs cooperation and monitoring could 
complement compliance and risk -management measures .” At a meeting in April 2015 in 
Florence, Italy , the WTO Committe e on Rules of Origin  reviewed the documentary requirements 
and certification practices of selected countries and regional groupings and recommended that 
whenever possible, self -certification may be recognized  (WTO 2015; see table 4 ).

Rules of Origin self -certification facilitates trade by enabling exporters or producers to sel f- 
declare the origin of their g oods without presenting a certification of origin issued by designated 
regulatory authorities.  The EU has recently introduced the Registered Exporter system (the REX 
system25), which is  based on a principle of self -certification by economic operators who wi ll make 
statements on origin themselves . An economic operator will need to  be registered in a database 
by the competent national authorit y to be categorized as a registered exporter. T he REX system 
will progressively and completely replace the current syst em of certificates of origin  issued by 
governmental authorities  and will be applied in the context of bilateral trade agreements 
between the EU and partner countries , with CETA (Compre hensive Economic and Trade 
Agreement) between the EU and Canada being the first pilot  (European Commission 2017 b). In 
2010, t he Association of Southeast Asian Nations  was one of the first to initiate a self -certification 
scheme , which provides certified ec onomic operators the opportunity to self -certify the 
originating status of goods  (ASEAN 2015) . In 2010– 11, The APEC Committee on Trade and 
Investment launched the  APEC Pathfinder Initiative for Self -Certification of Origin to reduc e 
administrative burdens and costs associated with navigating complex documentation and

 procedure s of rules of origin when using  free trade agreements . Eleven countries  participate in 
the initiative : Australia; Brunei Darussalam; Canada; Japan; Korea; Malay sia; New Zealand; the 
Philippines; Singapore; Taiwan, China;  and the United States  (APEC 2016b) . These practice s, 
when effectively run, will contribute to cost reduction, particularly for smaller exporters often 
located at a distance from the regulatory au thority  (table 5) .

Before implementing self -certification for rules of origin , developing countries are likely to face  
numerous challenges that must be recognized and mitigated.  Although  the private sector 
manufactures and produces goods in many developing countrie s, many firms are often less 
knowledgeable about the rules of origin that apply for trade agreements , and thi s may lead to 
errors. Systems for g ood practice record keeping are not always in place , which affects the  ability 
of authorities to verify and audi t. Moreover , authorities sometimes lack  good risk management 
and intelligence systems or the resources to put in place a compliance program. Authorized 
operator and preferred trader programs have only just begun being implemented in these 
countries. In add ition, t he legal environment ( customs law, trade Law , and so on ) may not enable 
self-certification, penalties , sanctions for noncompliance, or procedures for voluntary disclosure. 
43 
 Most developing countries have not yet implemented advance rulings , which ca n help reduce 
errors and enable the private sector to self -certify with confidence. Trading parties also need  
agreements among themselves to share information and cooperate extensively to catch fraud 
and misuse.  Although automation systems are steadily being deployed in most developing 
countries for trade -related transactions , they  also are not always available  to all parties . Once 
fully implemented across all border control agencies , such systems could enable self -certification.  
Electronic certificate of o rigin  
Electronic certificate of origin ( eCO) refers to a certificate of o rigin created and shared via the 
Internet. Chambers of c ommerce issue millions of certificates of origin annually . Currently, 
chambers of commerce offer two types of e CO services: (a ) e-application , which is applied 
electronically but issued manually ; and (b) fully integrated and paperless eCO service , which 
includes electronic issuance of the certificate of origin with electronic signature, rubber stamps , 
and security features in place. The approved e CO may be printed at the premises of certificate of 
origin applicants. Issuing certificate s of origin online helps  keep pace with the rapid shift to e -
commerce and improve s efficiency in serving the business community.  
To address concerns on fraud and the need to improve supply chain security, many c hambers of 
commerce also provide online servi ces for certificate s of origin for a secure trading environment. 
An eCO  reinforce s the integrity of certificate s of origin because  online systems can  include 
security features such as authenticity verification, optical watermarking technology to distinguis h 
between original and copies, digital rubber stamps of authorized officials, microprint to deter 
unauthorized reproduction, 2 -D bar code to ensure data integrity, public key infrastructure  
technology to ensure data security and authenticity , and printer co ntrol language to control the 
printing of only one original certificate of origin. The refore,  the eCO system ensures greater 
transpa rency and lowers time and cost among c ustoms administrations, exporters, importers, 
banks , and stakeholders.  
The eCO provide s several advantages over manual procedures.  It increases consistency of 
applications , resulting in fewer rejections; minimizes data inaccuracy; and  helps combat fraud 
and forged documentation. In addition, recipients of an eCO and foreign authorities can also 
check the authenticity of a document online.  An eCO saves time and costs for customers of local 
chambers  of commerce  by eliminating the need to travel and queue for the submission and 
collection of a certificate of origin . It enables chambers  of comme rce to provide certification 
services in an efficient, transparent , and secure environ ment.  It also saves time and cost for 
chambers  of commerce  by significantly reducing the burden for extensive filing and storage 
facilities for paper- based certificate of  origin  documentation.  For SMEs , e-certification provides 
for online application track ing, e-notification on status of applications , direct link to banks for 
clearance  of letters of credit,  and speedy c ustoms clearance.   
A key challenge for c hambers of c ommerce is to create trust and ensure the validity of the eCO.  
Currently , many governmen t agencies do not trust the information provided by chambers of 
commerce. More  work needs to be done to create confidence in e -certification in developing 
countries  (tabl e 6).

Automation to Interconnectivity  in a D igital Age 
Although  border management practices are being moderniz ed, often  emphasi zing automation, 
adap tation to e -commerce for customs and border agencies has been slow.   
Since the 1960s , governments have invested in automation to lower trade transaction costs, 
reduce time to process  paperwork, and improve the efficiency of transactions to facilitate trade . 
In the late 1990s and early 2000s , more ambitious efforts began with the implementation of 
national single window systems that brought together many trade -related agencies to process 
permits, certificates, and payments online through a single system (see  figure 5). Customs and 
trade -related agencies saw a unique opportunity to make procedures more transparent and 
efficient, as well as more  predictable through ICT.  The automation environment, particularly in 
trade facilitation and logistics in developing c ountries and least developed countries , requires 
addressing numerous differ ent facets before  consumers and businesses can  benefit from a 
lowering of costs : 45 
 • Legal issues to ensure an effective trade facilitation system  (discussed earlier)  
• The level of autom ation among trade -related agencies that regulate cross -border trade 
and the ir interconnectivity within agencies and their offices, between agencies , and, 
particularly,  between agencies of neighboring countries in areas with  regional 
communities and customs  unions  
• Network access and bandwidth that relates to telecommunication infrastructure 
nationally and specifically at borders  
• Sophistication of the business community , especially  the logistics providers , to take 
advantage of electronic developments

Many countries struggle with automation because o f the lack of ICT infrastructure, poor I nternet 
services, outdated software and hardware, and uneven capacity of public and private sector s to 
handle transactions electronically . Clearly, developing countries cannot embark on automation 
reforms at a rapid scale. Realities such as reduction of funding limitations, reengineering 
46 
 procedures, commitment of government actors to share information, and creation of an 
administrative culture that is comfortable with e -transactions take time.  
Automation of trade -related procedures is successful only if the solutions are tailored around 
available ICT infrastructure, ICT access and skills , and interest in engagement by traders. If traders 
are involved initially  in an au tomation process and can help propose solutions, i dentify 
challenges, support and advocate for  reform, and monitor the reforms, the likelihood of success 
and sustainability is higher. Government s need to foster private sector engagement and should 
ensure o utreach and engagement with the private sector sta keholders to guarantee  that they 
fully benefit from new systems and tools. Such engagement can also help change the perception 
from one of governments being instruments of compliance to that of government s providing 
services that benefit private sector growth. If positive engagement is not fostered, many of the 
intended benefits gained through automation in trade could go largely unnoticed.   
Automation provides real- time savings in trade transactions. In a r ecent World Bank Group study, 
trade facilitation measures in the TFA that had the most effect  on time reduction included 
automation. Automation (including the electronic exchange of documents and the application of 
risk management procedures) is responsib le for about 30 percent (figure 6)  of the reduction in 
time to import  (Hillberry and Zhang 2015) . 
Figure 6: Share of Governance and Automation in Time to Import , 2015

Typically, customs agencies are further ahead in au tomation of procedures than other agencies 
in the trade facilitation space. Thus, although customs agencies can clear goods before arrival at 
port because of the electronic systems and information at their  disposal, the quarantine, health, 
and standards ag encies may still be handling paper and lack the systems to conduct clearance 
procedures in advance, provide decisions in a timely manner, and conduct business online. A 
transition from paper documentation and manual procedures to automation of procedures a nd Governance and Automation 
account for the largest 
reduction in Time to Import
Governance Automation Other factors47 
 interoperability of systems  is a prerequisite to customs and other agencies providing such 
facilitation. Interconnectivity among agencies has been met with less enthusiasm and more 
resistance because it suggests information sharing, creation of opportun ities for shared or joint 
transactions, and more accountability. Central America, for example, has a common electronic 
general declaration for customs among five countries that is transmitted regionally th rough an 
electronic platform. The same platform has  now enabled ministries of health to process mutual 
recognition of sanitary registration among the five countries so that registration of products 
requiring sanitary controls does not have to be duplicated  five times. Col ombia, Costa Rica, and 
Mauritius ha ve implemented electronic single window systems that enable traders to interact 
with numerous government agencies online to finalize paperwork required to conduct trade. Port 
single window or port communit y systems developed in France, Spain, and the Unite d Kingdom 
serve to automate all transactions at a port for traders. Countries are experimenting with other 
enabling technologies to process payments, conduct transactions through mobile telephony, use 
electronic sensors and scanners to control cargo, and u se RFID (radio -frequency identification) 
to track cargo as it moves through a trade corridor or to track suppliers across a supply chain. 
Although many of these initiatives are works in progress, they have  resulted in significant time 
and cost savings to t raders. The following section discusses some automation tools in more detail.  
Publishing information online  
With automation and digital transformation, traders expect greater transparency of information, 
predictability  of procedures, and traceability of transactions.  In this context, government 
agencies have begun providing traders with easier access to trade -related regulations, practices, 
and policies . The WTO  TFA recognizes the importance of this access,  and Articles 1 –5 of the 
agreement, which focus on transparency, accountability, and predictability, include the 
following:  
• Publication and availability of information  
• Opportunity to comment on information before entry into force and consultation s  
• Advance rulings  
• Appeal or review procedures  
• Other measure s to enhance impartiality, nondiscrimination, and transparency  
In most developing countries , information about rules , regulations , and procedures is  paper 
based and not easily accessible to the public.  In addition, n either customs nor other border 
authorities have developed and published practical guides to their import, export, and transit 
procedures, including appeal procedures. Some border agencies —in particular, customs —
publish required forms and documents  on their websites . Most countries do not have specific 
legal provisions that require or authorize customs or other border agencies to develop and 
publish on the Internet the practical guides to t heir procedures or required forms and 
documents. Few countries have formal administrative procedures concerning publication of 
website information by the border authorities. Publication of such information appears to be 
done on an ad hoc basis. Moreover, w ebsite information is not promptly updated. Often this is 
due to limited resources available for website maintenance. To respond to this problem, Lao 48 
 PDR26Bangladesh27, Botswana28, Cambodia29, Lesotho,30 Nepal31, Vietnam32and Malawi amongst 
others have recently implemented a national trade portal that allows  importers and exporters to 
find all the information they req uire for import ing and export ing goods ( see figure 7). Centralizing 
information into one virtual location is especially beneficial for SMEs, because  many  lack the 
resources  of large firms to research  requirements and manage logistics and, as a result, face  a 
disproportionate cost burden in participating in e-commerce .

Providing advance information online  
To address heightened security measures and pro tect international supply chains against 
terrorist threats , governments have placed an increased regulatory burden on international trade  
(Kerswell and Kunaka 2015) . As such, many customs administrations have provisions  and 
requirements for advance submiss ion of detailed cargo and vessel data (in some cases , advance 
customs declarations as well) for p urposes of risk assessment for contraband, revenue fraud, 
trade facilitation , and so on . In the United States, the Automated Manifest System was designed 
by U. S. Customs  and Border Protection  to facilitate cargo arrival and release information among  
steam shipping lines, airlines , and railways for shipments destined to or transiting the United 
States. Currently, it is used for electronic air manifests only, whil e the electronic truck, rail, and 
sea manifests have been transitioned to ACE (Automated Commercial Environment) , which is the

 U.S. Single Window. The EU Advance Cargo Declaration Regime was effective January 2011 . It is 
like (and possibly modeled on) the U.S. Automated Manifest System , but differs regarding 
appl ication  to all shipping sectors, no req uired  bonds , and other aspects .  
Advance information is a practice that should generally be encouraged and , where it exists , 
continued.  It supports improved customs and border management outcomes by facilitating 
improved access to transactional data (timeliness) that allows enhanced profiling and targeting 
of all transactional risks in a streamlined and nonduplicative manner.  Risk management –based 
systems allow customs and other border agencies to determine the type of cargo  and its level of 
risk and conduct the clearance process in advance of the cargo arriving at  the border.  This 
approach allows for faster processing time and less waiting time at the border, enabling a 
speedier delivery to destination.  Goods that are determined to be low risk can then be cleared 
for release before  the goods arriv e at the border , allowing them to  leave the border point 
immediately when  they arrive.  The decision to release the goo ds can also be transmitted to the 
carrier so that the goods can seamless ly pass through the border, thereby  reducing lengthy delays 
for complet ion of  paperwork or pay ment of  duties at the border and decreasing costs associated 
with storage at the border.  
Most developed  economies have created  advanced information submission re quirements that 
shippers , importers , and exporters are obligated to meet.  In the EU, economic operators must 
be registered and have an identification number, submit electronic informat ion ( entry or e xit) at 
least 24 hours before arrival or departure for de ep sea container shipping (4 hours for deep sea 
bulk shipping and 2 hours for short sea shipping), submit an arrival notification to c ustoms on 
arrival, and issue a movement reference number if an advance cargo declaration  has been 
completed. The receiving  customs office in the EU conducts a risk analysis for safety and security 
and determines risk type and action to be taken, if any. The United States implements a series of 
advanced -cargo-declaration  type  of initiatives  that include the CSI (Container Security Initiative), 
the C-TPAT ( Customs -Trade Partnership Against Terrorism), the 10+2 initiative , the Secure Freight 
Initiative,  and the AQUA ( Advanced Qualified Unloading Approval)  Lane, some of which affect 
SME e -commerce trade. In several  developing countries, customs agencies process declaration 
information after the goods have arrived in the country and documents are presented to 
customs. This approach causes delays because  the good s must stay at the border while customs 
and other border a gencies complete their due diligence processes.  
The implications and challenges for e -commerce logistics and facilitation are clear,  especially  for 
SMEs for whom meeting complex trading requirements  can mean the difference between trading 
internationally o r not.  Advance cargo declaration combined with issues related to de minimis and 
simplified clearance regimes all affect SME e -commerce trade. The EU’s new requirement for 
simplified declaration requ ires members to exchange automatically information about e ach 
consignment (unique ID, value, weight , and consignee information ), which  may reduce the 
burden on SMEs . However, the connectivity of c ustoms to p ostal departments in the EU is still 
varied acros s its member countries , and thus,  these developments will take time to be 
implemented . Typically , any direct  costs relate to overall information technology systems 
infrastructure, not specifically the capacity to lodge in advance . As such , most costs relat e to 
those incurred by the provider, not by a border agency or government authority. In certain cases, 50 
 however, SMEs may face challenges simply from the disproportionate time and complexity of  
meeting advance information requirements. Although  large firms can take advantage of the 
authori zed economic operators’  concept if it is applicable to them and beneficial, SMEs are 
normally not eligible.  
Advance electronic shipment information enables border agenc ies to provide faster facilitation 
measures for cross -border trade that have important benefits for e -commerce.  Pre-arrival 
processing is electronic submission of information about the goods that is  transmitted to 
government trade -related authorities before  the arrival or departure of goods. For air cargo, pr e-
arrival information is particularly important because  it allows customs agencies to grant 
immediate release. Because  a large volume of e -commerce cross -border trade comes by parcel 
or courier, the use of pre -arrival information for faster processing of air cargo shipments is critical 
to e-commerce.  It allows for better resource allocation of c ustoms and border officers and 
improved management of risk. High -risk consignments can be identified and controlled more 
easily. Decision -making times can improve , helping reduce costs and allow ing parcel delivery 
companies to meet their customer delivery deadlines and reduce warehouse costs.  EU members 
reported that advance electronic data for postal items were  likely to become a legal requirement 
as part of the customs se curity program (WCO 2016b ). 
Both the WTO TFA (Article 7.1) and the Revised Kyoto Convention (Standard 3.25) allow for 
traders to submit goods declarations and supporting documents before  arrival of goods.  Customs 
can also provide faster clearance pro cesses  using a simplified declaration and introdu ce an 
expedited shipment regime . The TFA already promotes the use of such a regime for air cargo 
(Article 7.8) that would allow for less bureaucracy.  Such facilitation measures can be provided to 
e-commerce –relate d goods.  
For obtaining  worthwhile  advanced information and  given the high volume of packages in the e -
commerce world, the importance of government and  customs authorities’  capacity to accept and 
process advance electronic data is critical.  Businesses, including SMEs , need to be made aware 
of the  importance of such practices for compliance , and this needs to be conducted through 
regular dialogue among  the stakeholders. Many developing countries have customs -to-business 
forums that,  if they meet regularly , can be used for such education campaigns.  
Private sector participation in clearance data submission process  
As e -commerce gains traction, a new modality of public and priva te sector cooperation is 
emerging . In this modality, t he private sector collect s information that is critical for customs, such 
as the type of product, price, destination, cost of transportation, payment information, mode of 
delivery, package -tracking info rmation , and associated duties , and  would allow for speedier risk 
management an d clearance. T he private sector would  become a provider of such information 
and services to customs and other border agencies, enhancing intelligence, risk management, 
and fraud  detection and reducing duty evasion and leakage for border agencies. A broader , more 
in-depth  exchange of data would have to be carefully managed , and incentives  such as provision 
of simplified regimes, tax exemptions , and swift clearance procedures  would have to be put in 
place for the private sector to provide such data . Such coop eration and sharing of roles are  
becoming increasingly more critical for customs and border agencies. However, this data sharing 51 
 is at an early stage and while data sharing with some express carriers is well- developed in some 
countries, there is very little with postal authorities or retail platforms or payments companies.  
Express delivery companies are also well placed to provide services an d information to customs  
and have developed systems that interface with CBP and other agencies. Because  express 
delivery services manage a large percentage of cross -border e -commerce cargo, they can  do the 
following  (GEA 2015) :  
• Provide electronic shipment  information in advance of arrival of the cargo so that risk 
analysis can be conducted before  goods arriv e 
• Support r isk analysis by providing a risk assessment and validation of data provided by 
the shipper  
• Implement track and trace systems so that package s deemed suspicious by c ustoms are 
sent to customs for further examination  
• Provide customs with facilities to review  cargo at its  warehouses  
• Share information on shippers and consignees to identify risk  
In many countries, information sharing among partners to enhance risk  assessment  and 
intelligence for customs is still evolving. In a study conducted by the WCO and Uni versity of 
Lausanne, 24 customs administrations from different parts of the world reported on their degree 
of collaboration  and information sharing with other parties, particularly on risk -related 
intelligence.  The study found limited openness  (figure 8) . Information sharing was m ore 
prevalent among neighboring customs administrations , and only 13 percent of the 
administrations had a memorandum of understanding  for sharing data with an e -commerce 
operator. Although customs agencies did report collaboration with other government age ncies 
and private sector entities , such collaboration was not routine or standard practice. The study 
reported  that the  poorest information sharing between customs and agencies related to 
immigration, environment al protection, and health (Cross -Border Rese arch Association, EPFL , 
and HEC -UNIL  (2011) . In many of these countries, government agencies do not trust the private 
sector.  In the United States  and other developed countries, border agencies have been working 
in partnership with  the private sector through trusted trader programs and other mechanism s of 
dialogue for years , which has built mutual credibility and trust. This is not the case in many 
developing countries, where a strong revenue focus and lack of risk management for cu stoms 
suggest  that such programs are absent and difficult to initiate.

Electronic invoicing   
E-Invoicing has increasingly picked up traction in the past decade with the growth of e -commerce 
and market platforms , and many vendors have been creating and supporting robust, reliable e -
invoicing systems for some time . The EU has been working on an e -invoicing proj ect since 2010 , 
when it set a goal for e -invoicing  to be the primary method of invoicing within the union by 2020. 
Directive 2014/55/EU on e -invoicing promulgated that both paper and electronic invoices were 
equivalent and guaranteed the authenticity of or igin and date of issue until retention by the 
recipient. Further, member states have until November 2018 to adopt e -invoicing in public 
procurement. These directives face challenges to becom ing effective because  the countries need 
to review their legal and  administrative rules and procedures. Because  the directive is technology 
neutral and different countries may have adopted different standards and formats, format 
compatibility could be costly, which would reduce benefits and savings of automation at least  
initially. However, cost savings from e -invoicing include less printing, storing , and mailing ; faster 
invoicing ; lower error rates ; and better traceability and tax compliance. The benefits of accuracy 
and completeness must be weighed against the potential  for fraud and system security in e -
invoicing systems , though online systems are generally more secure if robustly designed and 
controlled .  
Electronic methods of payment 
Standard 4.6 of the Revised Kyoto Convention promotes the use of electronic fund transfers to 
facilitate payment. For trade facilitation , significant benefits from using e -payment systems ran ge 
53 
 from increased security to reduction in the carrying of significant amounts of cash (e.g., for truck 
drivers facing significant waits at border che ckpoints, especially in landlocked countries) to more 
transparency in the payment of customs and related fees  to reduced informal paymen ts, among 
numerous others . Allowing around -the-clock  payment and permitting  importers to pay via the 
Internet from anywhere limit discretionary practices. From an e -commerce perspective, e -
payment is a crucial building block that enables cross -border movement of goods with minimal 
friction.  
However, in most developing countries , electronic payment for border agency fees and charges 
is still in infancy. Although  most customs agencies have begun accepting electronic payment 
because of the reform and moderniza tion efforts adopted by them and the support they received 
from t he World Bank Group and other organizations to adopt EDI (UN/EDIFACT or XML messages) 
to automate the payment process, use electronic receipts, and receive electronic notices of 
payment, othe r border agencies still mainly use  manual procedures . These government agencies 
often accept only cash or bank checks fo r the payment of fees and charges. In several cases, 
agencies do not have payment facilities available at the point of clearance, and traders must 
arrange payment at another location.  
Private sector stakeholders would like all the various agency fees to b e consolidated, preferabl y 
as a single e -payment  through a single system. Those agencies whose fees go into a national 
consolidated account are normally open to collection of their fees in this way, but this approach 
is often problematic for agencies that  typically fund their operations through fee colle ction (such 
as standards agencies ). Implementation of such arrangements would typically require 
administrative policies concerning credits to the various accounts and should be formalized with 
memorandums of  understanding  among the agencies. As such, e-payment solutions have 
become a core part of electronic s ingle window systems, because  they enable the payment of 
fees and duties for all government -related agencies that play a role in trade facilitation  (UNECE 
2016) . Even with c ustoms administrations, auto matic payment limitations exist. For instance, 
government financial regulations as of late 2016 in Sri Lanka allow payment from only two 
government banks, People ’s Bank and Ceylon Bank. Users must pay separat ely from their 
respective accounts to one of thes e banks. At other times , no credit card or debit card payments 
are accepted by customs for cargo or passenger payments , and no advance payments are 
allowed.  
For trade facilitation, a key player for enabling e -payment is the banking sector , which must agree 
to participate in e -payment systems and enable transmission of e -receipts. In many small 
developing countries , banks often do not consider the capital investment in developing e -
payment systems need ed to co nnect to government agencies to be worthwhi le. In areas  where  
a limited number of banks us e the system , it then restricts the number of SMEs and occasional 
importers who have adopted e -payment. The take -up by SMEs in general is also inhibited by their 
limited use of information technology  in general and the unreliability of the networks available 
for data transmission.  In addition, many traders do not have credit cards and are unable to pay 
in a noncash format online.  Several payment systems include creatio n of accounts by banks that 
can be debited against an amount that can be replenished on a frequent basis so that payments 
can be made online. There is ample room for trade -related administrations and commercial 54 
 banks to continue to in novate  solutions for payment of tax es, fees , and duties using ele ctronic 
means.  Innovation is particularly needed for the traders without bank accounts who  require 
unique  solutions  (figure 9) .

Several electronic meth ods of payment for e -commerce –related cross -border trade have 
emerged  (table 7) . They  can be classified into two broad categories : account -based payment 
mechanisms and electronic currency systems. Account -based systems are payment options 
linked to a perso nal account , such as credit cards, debit cards, online banking, electronic money , 
or e-wallets such as PayPal.  Mobile payments fall under this category as well.  Other emerging 
systems are the use of electronic currency systems such as smart cards, prepaid card payment s, 
and online cash. Credit cards still dominate e -commerce , but the use of e -wallets is gaining 
ground.

In developing c ountries, cash is still the most prevalent form of payment. Cash on delivery is being 
used for e -commerce transactions , particularly in Africa, the Middle East , and India. However, 
producers view cash on delivery as a risk because of potential lack of paym ent on delivery and 
the lag time between product delivery and payment. Although  still nascent,  mobile payment  is 
growing quickly in countries where I nternet penetration is low owing  to infrastructure problems. 
An important facilitation alternat ive for enab ling e -commerce is to harmonize e -payment 
regulations at a regional level and facilitate mutual recognition of digital payment systems. A 
recommendation made by PayPal has been to create an APEC e-commerce steering group to set 
up principles fo r local regu lators  and provide oversight on regulatory issues around e -payment.  
Electronic  single window  
The term s ingle window  is used to refer to different business environments or facilities where 
multiple tasks leading to a single outcome may be carried out by di fferent parties based on  
common information being supplied once.  Countries have been eager to adopt elec tronic single 
windows for trade  to digitize and automate all paper transactions that border -related agencies 
require for a trade transaction . The weak i nterconnectivity of regulatory agencies has been a 
driving force for this automation. U pon a vessel ’s arrival at port, it is subject to certain formalities 
that often involve a host  of actors, including the c oast guard, port authority, customs, 
immigration , ministry of a griculture, and m inistry of h ealth. These agencies require specific 
information pertaining to time of arrival, vessel, crew, and cargo onboard. Coordination issues 
often begin at this point and continue with tra nsactions throughout the clear ance process, 
through corridors, borders, and clearance points  (Huria and Brenton 2015) . E-commerce trade 
requires  a seamless flow of information across actors who make sequenced decisions to ensure 
the smooth flow of cargo.  
In the context of trade facilitation, the single window is usually applied to regulatory authorities 
(for example,  customs, food and drug, quarantine, and m inistry of trade) that are involved in the 
import  and export clearance process and border control. Th is kind of single window helps  traders’  
complete formalities and pay fees related to import or export procedures . For traders, the real 
benefit of a s ingle window stems from reduction in the time and costs required to undertake 
bureaucratic procedures.  In addition, the ability to pay duties  and fees online creates significant 56 
 time savings and efficiency gains for traders. By reducing face -to-face interactions with 
government officials, the single window limits the informal or “extra official”  payments  traders 
need to make. The ability t o track their paperwork and monitor steps to complete procedures 
greatly enhances predictability of processes and transparency.  All these factors result in faster 
clearance and release  times for cargo to reach i ts target destination.   
All recent projects around the world aimed at implementing a n ational single window have 
predicated it on an electronic transactions environment, attempting to achieve both  a single -
submission process and a paperless environment.  This approach is in the spirit of the Revised 
Kyoto Convention, which urges parties to make “maximum practicabl e use of information 
technology”  (WCO 1999, appendix I to annex I).  Also, Article 10.4.1 of the recent WTO TFA  
(entered into force February 22, 201 7) places  a strong obligation on member state s to implement 
an electronic national single window:  “Members shall endeavor  to establish or maintain a single 
window, enabling traders to submit documentation and/or data requirements for importation, 
exportation or transit of goods through a single entry  point to the participating authorities or 
agencies .” Article 10.3.4 notes t he technology needed: “Members shall, to the extent possible 
and practical, use information technolo gy to support the single window .” Recommendation 35 , 
Establishing a Legal Framew ork for I nternational Trade Single Window , by the United Nations 
Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN CEFACT 2010) , provides important 
guidance.  It has been used by many countries working to develop their national single windows  
(figur e 10) .

The single window system involves  varying degrees of sophistication and complexity across the 
world  (figure 11) . In some countries, the s ingle window is a portal allowing online application for  
licenses or permit s with each agency. In other countries, it  allows online submission and 
processing,  but the only document that carries legal value is a printed paper documen t with a 
hand signature or stamp by the trader or the government agency.  In still other  countrie s, the 
single window is a combination of d irect trader input for customs declarations and a connection 
to a logistics network possi bly via a  port authority. Similarly, what some developed countries call 
a single window is  a database or data mining facilities for shared information that different 
agencies may use for different risk assessment purposes pertaining to the agencies’ specific 
business (for example,  customs, biosecurity, or police ). However, t his is also a s ingle window for 
the benefit of the regulatory authorities.

In a survey of 181 countries, 73 countries have impleme nted some form of electronic s ingle 
window (World Bank 201 0). Most of  the single windows in the survey connect some, but not all 
agencies.  Thus,  manual processes and paperwork are still necessary for certain procedures . The 
single window of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (A SEAN) is a regional effort that 
supports  electronic transactions and data exchange among customs agencies in ASEAN through 
single windows of ASEAN member states.  It is an initiative to enable regional cross -border t rade 
in the ASEAN  community . The ASEAN si ngle window enables data exchange on the intra -ASEAN 
certificate of origin (ATIGA [ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement] Form D) and the ASEAN Cust oms 
Declaration Document.  Other transactions and data exchanges are curren tly being explored and 
could have the potential to greatly facilitate e -commerce in ASEAN countries.  ASEAN’s approach 
focuses on “your export is my import ,” while Europe is focused on making the cross -border 
movement of goods more efficient. (McLinden and others 2011) . 
59 
 The electronic single windo w offers tremendous cost reduction and efficiency gains for cross -
border e -commerce traders  by allow ing traders to interface with government agencies and 
complete trade -related  paperwork in one virtual space . Single windows reduce the cost of 
customs and o ther processes  through a virtual environment, particularly for small traders that 
deal with large volumes of small parcels . Offsetting transaction costs is important for busine ss 
survival.  According to the  OECD , “customs barriers can add up to 24 percent p remi um onto the 
price of goods sold”  (GEA 2014).  Through the single window, simplification , standardization, and 
harmonization of customs procedures allow  SMEs to navigate bure aucracy and paperwork across 
borders  easily , which  has special implications for e-commerce . 
The WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement  
No international agreement focused specific attention on expedited shipments until the WTO ’s 
Trade Facilitation Agreement  (TFA). Until the entry into force of the WTO TFA, there was no 
binding agreement o n the type of expedited treatment for e -commerce as opposed to general 
cargo, other than recommended practices like the WCO’s Guidelines for the Immediate Release 
of Consignmen ts by Customs (WCO 2014). The TFA contains specific provisions (Article 7.8 on 
expedited shipments) to allow for the expedited release of those goods entered through air cargo 
facilities, including reduced documentary requirements for clearance and impleme ntation of a 
de minimis  threshold or single information submission from traders or their agents ( see the 
section on simplifying trade -related regulations and procedures in e -commerce earlier  in this 
note). The rapid clearance of high -value and time -sensiti ve goods is also dependent on the ability 
of Customs to effectively process info rmation submitted ahead of arrival (article 7.1 on 
submission of pre -arrival information), to determine its risk (article 7.4 on risk management) if 
further examinations are ne eded, and to separate the physical release of goods from clearance 
(article 7.3 separation of release from final determination of customs duties, taxes, and fees).  
Although the TFA was agreed upon to  speed up and facilitate the trade of goods  generally, a 
number of specific articles have a positive effect on e -commerce. Apart from th ose above these 
are the following:  
• Information available through the Internet (Article 1. 2). SMEs share a disproportionate 
burden in accessing trade -related information, and trade portals can mitigate some of 
those challenges (see section on automation earlier in the note).  
• Opportunity to comment and consultation for the private sector (Article 2).  This would 
enable the private sector to be actively engaged in the development of sector policies and 
rules and regulations.  
• General discipline s on fees and cha rges (article 6.1).  Streamlined and transparent fee 
structures are crucial for an e -commerce environment.  
• E-payment (article 7.2).  Burdensome manual processes defeat the purpose of online 
trade (see section on electronic methods of payment earlier in the note).  
• Authorized operators (AO) (article 7.7).  Providing low -risk marketplaces and shippers with 
an authorized operator status can greatly benefit e -commerce.  
• Border agency coordination (Article 8).  This is a crucial building block for facilitating cros s-
border e -commerce  trade.  60 
 • Single window ( Article 10.4).  The single window system is discussed in detail in the section 
earlier in this note.  
Moreover, the special and differential treatment provided in the TFA enables developing 
countries to receive finan cial and technical assistance to meet its obligations —a first for an 
international agreement. In addition, t he WCO’s Guidelines for the Immediate Release of 
Consignments by Customs  are very relevan t to e -commerce trade given their emphasis on 
differentiati ng treatment for correspondence and documents; consignments below a duty , tax, 
or de minimis threshold; consignments  below a formal declaration threshold; and consignments  
requiring formal entry.  
The Role of Postal S ervices  
Postal operators are faced with the dual challenge of competing  against and working  with 
logistics providers and parcel delivery companies.  Although many postal operators remain 
government agencies, over the past three decades, several postal operators have been freed 
somewhat from government constraints ; that is, they have been corporatized or privatized, 
which has helped them better compete with traditional parcel delivery companies. However, in 
many cases universal service obligations continue to influence the ability of postal operato rs to 
be as nimble,  agile, and flexible as their private sector competitors. Nevertheless, universal 
service obligations also lead to a reach advantage. Postal operators have large physical 
infrastructure and, often, personnel assigned to remote locations.  This structure mea ns that 
often the only delivery provider for these remote areas is often the postal service, leading 
marketplaces and logistics providers to use them to deliver goods. An example is the Parcel Select 
program of the U.S. Postal Service (U SPS) that FedEx and UPS, traditio nal competitors, use for 
delivery.  
Postal services can also provide additional services such as advance data online  (see box 2), 
automating systems , and integratio n with c ustoms and border authorities. Advance data enable 
not only postal authorities to se gment and better serve their customers , but also border agencies 
to manage risks.  For cross -border commerce,  data are provided in another countr y, requiring 
better coordination and cooperation among  postal authorities  and often agreements with  the 
UPU or through other regional integration efforts.  
 61 
  
 
There are ongoing efforts in many countries and internationally to better integrate  postal 
services with c ustoms . The WCO has worked with the UPU  to create electronic message protocols 
that allow post offices to exchange  data  in Customs Declarations  CN 22 and 23, the customs 
declaration s for international mail, using EDI. UPU has also created the electronic Customs 
Declaration System using the joint WCO –UPU customs –to–postal se rvice  EDI message. Such 
interchange of data between the postal service and customs can greatly reduce steps required 
for e -commerce goods arriving by post al service  to clear customs procedures  (WCO 2015b) .  
Postal operators around the world are likely to b e key players in e -commerce provided they adapt 
sufficiently to service the market. Postal operators in most countries are trusted intermediaries 
with a legal standing and often are required to serve all citizens. They reach remote corners of 
countries , have experience picki ng up from the first mile and delivering to the last mile , and are 
well positioned to connect between senders and receivers both physically and electronically.  
Postal operators have survived many technological disruptions through out history, though they 
have had the backing of governments . Historically , postal operators have obtained the bulk of Box 2: Postal Services and the Internet of Things  
The Inspector General of the U.S. Postal Service commented on the possibility of additional 
services:  
Postal systems certainly have rich physical networks tha t can be used in any 
adap tation, connecting citizens to e -commerce. One potential area is the 
Internet of Things. The U.S. Postal Service has 211,000 vehicles; 230,000 
carriers; 154 million delivery points; and 31,000 post offices. In theory, each 
componen t of physical infrastruct ure—whether a mailbox, a vehicle, a 
machine, or a letter carrier equipped with sensors —could connect to the 
Internet of Things. At a minimum, this digitally -enabled network could 
provide a much more detailed level of notification, alerting customers not 
only when a package has arrived but when a carrier is nearby, while at the 
same time providing important operational information such as when it is 
time for vehicle maintenance. This information -rich system could also 
provide a platf orm for automated commerc e. Run out of diapers, sensors 
tell the postal system and it delivers more. This platform could also be useful 
to local governments, utilities, and smart city initiatives. As postal vehicles

 their revenues from letters. However, this line of business is now declining in most countries. I n 
the United States,  for instance, first class m ail has been declin ing at 4 percent per year  (Callan 
and Reisner 2015) .  
Postal operators will need to continue to adapt to new developments  in logistics ( see the section 
that follows ), anticipate market changes and trends , and integrate with and adjust to new 
technologies  to stay relevant  as marketplaces and logistics providers fight to deliver packages to 
consumers.  Postal operators  need to be able to offer their services electronically and enable e -
payment either in house or through tie ups with third- party providers. Many  postal providers are 
choos ing to compete directly with logistics providers and provide warehousing, inventory, 
fulfillment , and other services. However , all these changes will require changes to postal business 
models. Postal operators will need to be more agile, contain costs , be able to enter into service -
level agreements with customers to guarantee quality and reliability, and have technologies that 
can integrate with vendors and customers. Several postal operators  have adapted for th e e-
commerce age as they seek to modernize, to automate , and to provide value added services . An 
example is the case of European po stal o perators. Although some of t heir modernization has 
been  in response to the market , much  of it has also been due to EU d irectives and strategies to 
create a common market for postal services  (see the section on regional integration  later in this 
note ).  
In the EU, the process started with the First Postal S ervices Directive in 1997 that aimed to 
improve domestic and intra- EU postal services . It was followed by an amendment  in 2002 that 
aimed to reduce the monopoly of national operators. A further amendment in 2008 introduced 
the legal basis for the accomplishment of the internal market for postal services.  In general, the 
objectives of EU policy in the postal sector  are to define a univ ersal postal service as a right of 
access to postal services for users  with a  minimum range of services of specified quality to be  
provided in all EU countries at affordable prices  (European Co mmission 2017a) . These 
developments have led to consolidation a mong different government operators (formation of  
PostNord through a merger of Sweden’s Posten and Denmark’s Post Danmark in 2009) and 
among government and private operators (D eutsche Post’s ac quisition of DHL and its 
privatization).  
Postal operator service levels and offerings have also improved. La Poste i n France assists SMEs 
in building websites through Box e -commerce. Britain’s Royal Mail offers discounted services to 
SMEs through the Simp le Ways program. Sweden’s PostNord has a parcel service, MyPack  
Collect , that allows SMEs to send parcels to consumers within the entire Nordic region and not 
just domestically. Germany’s DHL is an integrated logistics provider and was also the first parce l 
delivery operator to launch  a secure online shopping portal —MeinPaket.de, a one -stop shop  
combining shopping and trusted shipping services . The website provides  European e -retailers a 
marketplace in Germany without the necessity of building a local prese nce (IPC and PostEurop 
2012) . Aside from European postal operators who offer these services, Australia Post offers the  
Farmhouse Direct platform that provides farmers and primary producers a website for selling 
goods and charges a 7.5  percent  commission on  sales. Goods ship through the post al se rvice .  
In some  countries , regulations need to be clarified before postal operators can provide value 
added services.  Legislative and regulatory frameworks have affected p ostal services ’ 63 
 development in relation to pr icing, reach and public access, and frequency throughout a  
country ’s geography  through the requirement to meet community service obligations.  In many 
countries, postal services have been corporatized and even privatized. Operators that have been 
freed from constraints , despite retaining universal service obligations, tend to have responded 
better to market signals. In other countries, like the United States , this is not the case. Section 
101 of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (H. R.  6407, 109 th Congress, 2d Sess., 
2006) defines “ postal services ” as “the delivery of letters, printed matter, or mailable packages, 
including acceptance, collection, sorting, transportation, or other functions ancillary thereto. ” 
Asher, Callan , and Marsh  (2011, 13)  argue that “the term ancillary has not yet been fully defined 
through the regulatory filing process so that many …  digital products and services may 
supplement or be a natural extension of current products and services. For other initiatives, new 
statutory authority may be necessary. Ongoing legislative debates provide the Postal Service with 
an opportunity to make its case to policymakers to seek the necessary changes. ”  
However, parcel companies have expressed concerns about fair competition with incumbent  
postal service providers.  With the drop -in letters and business mail and the continued need to 
meet community service obligation  requirements in many cases, postal oper ators  have expanded  
core offerings into the package delivery space to make up for reven ue drops. The International 
Air Transport Association  estimates that 72 percent of cross -border parcels are delivered by the 
post al service  (FIATA). This has led to some  friction with the private sector that  claims  that 
national postal operators have a com petitive advantage over private express companies. 
National postal operators  often do not need to pay state and local taxes, are exempt from many 
local regulations, and may be given  preferential access to capital among the other benefits they 
may receive. Private express companies  view the postal operator’s role in e -commerce as 
disruptive to a well- functioning private market, a role  that detracts from  the core government  
mission and mandates and drains scarce resources. ( FIATA).  
In many developing countri es, private express companies have not expressed such concerns. 
Postal development is often key for developing countries because  alternatives to the postal 
services rarely exist and the key opportunity for e -commerce may lie in modernizing and 
automating national postal delivery systems . In India, Amazon uses India Post’s network of over 
150,000 post offices . More than 125,000 post offices are in rural areas servicing over 25,000 pin 
codes , thereby vastly expanding Amazon’s  delivery reach and reducing its n eed to create a 
separate distribution infrastructure , particularly for hard -to-reach areas ( Sasi 2016 ). Makers of 
handicrafts an d artisanal products located in  rural areas are increasingly using India Post as the 
parcel company of choice (or necessity) to deliver to their customers found through the 
marketplaces. In August 2015, the Reserve Bank of India provided approval to 11 com panies , 
including India Post,  to set  up payment banks. The India Post Payments  Bank was launched in 
January 2017 and aims  to ser ve every corner of India’s geography and be a key part of the plan 
for improving connectivity for remote communities.  
The abili ty of postal services to negotiate the handling of payments will be crucial in many 
developing countries. For instance , although  India Post has vast experience in delivering cash 
through money orders, it has little experience in receiving payment for deliv eries,  a key facet of 
e-commerce in India and one that is intended to be addressed through the India Post Payment s 64 
 Bank . As such , regardless of context and environment , the special role of postal operators and 
their strategic objectives  suggest that dialogue and discussion with the private sector are needed 
to ensure that postal operators  can serve a role that meets their  objective s (and those of the 
community  service obligation s) and  enables the private sector to develop and thrive.  In most 
developing countries , postal operators are still government owned or managed . They need to 
involve the private sector— the key beneficiaries —in obtaining feedback and driving the refor m 
process.  
Under UPU regulations , postal agencies across the world coordinate shipments and members 
pay each other terminal dues , which are fees for carrying packages to their final destinations. 
These fees are based  on a group ’s level of economic developm ent. A USPS report estimated that 
China Post Airmail was charging  US$2.67 to mail a 200- gram package to the United States while 
USPS charged US $5.0 2 to send the same package domestically  (USP S OIC 2015) . For SMEs in 
developing countries, using the postal s ervice, if it is  efficient domestically, to export to 
developed  economies can often be competitive. However, parties in these developed  economies 
feel that sellers often take advantage of low terminal dues for commercial shipping when these 
dues were originally negotiated for letters and noncommercial packages. Often , postal shipments 
have been exempted  from rules applied to freight. O ther practices offer  advantage s to postal 
companies : sometimes they have a higher de  minimis threshold ; are provided pr eferential 
treatment for inspection ; or are delegated to collect duties and taxes on behalf of customs , as in 
South Africa.   
Postal operators  need to be able to collect and provide advance information to border agencies 
to improve compliance for risk manag ement . Their competitors, the parcel delivery companies 
around the world , are technologically savvy firms that have sophisticated operations. Postal 
operators  often  use manual and paper -based procedures, particularly in d eveloping countries. 
Even in develo ped economies , they are often not required to provide advance information . In 
the United States , no advance information is available for over 1 million packages imported 
through the postal service , which affects CBP’s ris k management (GEA 2016) . For instan ce, t est 
buys were conducted in 2016 . Illicit packages were bought from online vendors in other 
countries,  sent through the postal service of those countries , and delivered in the United States  
via USPS (Herman and Walters 2016) . None of these consignments was  scrutinized by CBP.  
Although companies are required to provide information to CBP, many shipments through the 
postal service do not come with the appropriate forms or advance information.  
Mislabeling  and under -invoi cing are also common for these postal shipments , leading to a lower 
level of compliance than compared to that of private companies . In the United Kingdom , postal 
declaration s CN 22 and 23 are manual and contain a limited data set not useful for risk 
manage ment at  customs. Given the lack of information , inspection decisions are not data and 
analysis based. In Canada, postal mail is sent to one of three processing centers where every 
piece is visually screened by the Canada Border Services Agency , a laborious  proces s given that 
it reports that courier volumes have increased from 8 million shipments in 1993 to 40 million 
shipments in 2016 , a 253 percent increase in  postal volumes alone since 2011 (Canada Border 
Services Agency 2016) . Currently, Canada Post is modernizing its procedures , including building 
the ability to collect  advance information to supply to the Canada Border Services Agency  for risk 65 
 management.  National postal operators face numerous challenges such as the  lack of 
streamlined customs processi ng; lack of customer service , particularly the failure to meet or 
inability  to commit to service delivery levels ; lack of optimized pricing , particularly for larger 
parcels ; and lack of clarity on restricted goods.  However, t he integration of postal servic es with 
border  authorities is still a challenge  (as was discussed in the section on challenges that impede 
firms from engaging in e -commerce earlier in this note) . 
The L ogistics of L ast Mile D elivery and 
Remote C onnectivity  
Last Mile Delivery  
Challenges i n last mile delivery abound . Quite often, it is  the most challenging and expensive leg 
and is estimated to be up to 50 percent of the delivery cost  sometimes (DMCC 2016). Some 
characterize these l ast-mile distribution systems  as networks: a collection of n odes ( that is,  
distribution centers) and links ( that is,  roads) over which goods flow using specific vehicle 
technologies  (Merchán and Blanco 2015 ). Over the years, and before the rise of e -commerce, 
these delivery  networks in urban areas ha d been designed as part of the traditional approach to 
distribution management and the larger logistics networks. When changes occurred— new 
concepts in supply chain management such as just -in-time delivery were introduced,  or changes  
occurred  in market structure such as  rapid urbanization and/or the growth of suburbs —these 
logistics networks were adjusted accordingly. Th ese adjustments included technology 
optimiz ation, infrastructure improvements, and modification to  logistics and distribution 
operations . The networks  lowered the cost of delivery and continue d to have the most efficient, 
flexible , and resilient supply chain. This approach is still important  today  as demonstrated by 
recent research in China. Lau and Su (2016)  noted that making certain improvements —such as 
more standardized packaging, better route planning, optimization across transportation modes, 
and tracking of returned products —can lower logistics costs by 30 percent, without significant 
investments in new technology or business models  and government poli cy. 
For discussion, in this note , we adopt a simple stylized network structure of last mile delivery 
with  three key elements : the distribution center, the delivery vehicle, and the receiving point.  
With the rise of e -commerce , the models of these three elements are being revisited extensively 
by firms and will have some implications for government policies . These developments and 
challenges are discussed below.  
The distribution center  
To deliver goods, c ompanies use various  type s of distribution centers.  In the urban freight 
literature, the term urban logistics spaces  encompasses all types of nodes in last  mile distribution 
networks  and include s (a) large distribution centers or warehouses generally located in the 
outskirts of the city; (b) platforms near c ity centers to enable freight transfer from trucks to light-
freight vehicles, often referred to as urban consolidation centers ; (c) urban freight -dedicated 
spaces at the neighborhood level, such as the micro -deconsolidation platforms; and (d) solutions 66 
 at the block and building levels, such as automatic parcel terminals ( for example,  the DHL 
Packstation in Germany)  (Merchán and Blanco 2015) . Table 8  summarizes the key characteristics 
of each type of urban logistics space , such as approximate surface area an d range of coverage, 
along with the vehicle and operational technologies generally used  (Merchán and Blanco 2015 ). 
Given the rise of e -commerce , policy makers need to determine which  spaces need to prioritized, 
developed , and utilized.

Note:  DC = distribution center ; WMS = warehouse management system . The use “ -2” in the table indicates no outbound vehicle 
or the final delivery point.  
 
E-commerce distribution centers  demand more than three times the logistics space when 
compared to traditional distribution brick and mortar  spaces . E-commerce vendors need to sto ck 
a wider variety of SKUs  (stock keeping units) (product variety) ; have more buffer stock on hand  
(inventory levels) ; have more spac e for processing returned items  (reverse logistics) ; and have 
more space for  individual order picking, packing, and shipping directly to consumers  (B2C 
shipping)  (Prologis 2014) . Online apparel purchases have one of the highest return rates at about 
30 per cent. To compete with physical stores and encourage trial and purchase, etai lers offer free 
returns, and consumers readily buy multiple colors and sizes and send back the unwanted 
product (Rosenberg 2016) . And unlike in long -distance transport, where often  there is a market 
for return loads, the issue of empty returns is more prom inent , more difficult  to solve , and 
costlier for e -commerce firms .  
Scarcity of land in urban environments affects  policy  makers ’ ability to add infrastructure and 
capacity for inc reased e -commerce shipments. The reality of today’s urban environment is tha t 
67 
 many cities lack  the ability to add new infrastructure such as  new lanes on existing roads or lanes 
dedicated to freight traffic for e -commerce . In the past, distribution centers  or facilities that 
cater ed to last mile distribution typically served  businesses or parcel companies.  This trend is 
now changing globally. Over the past several years, in the United States, large warehouses have 
been  built outside of major cities but still close to air and sea ports  and highways  or near parcel 
delivery hubs to  cater to last mile delivery  for consumers because of e-commerce . These facilities  
are much bigger than older warehouse s, often measuring more than 1 million square feet ( The 
Economis t 2014) . In some cities, like Chicago, su rging demand has helped set off a speculative -
building boom , and supply is unable to keep up with demand. There , in July 2016, 28 warehouse 
users were in the market for 18 million square feet of space, triple the av ailable supply, and  e-
commerce alone comp rised  20 percent of t hat demand . Space close r to population centers has 
become an especially demanded  commodity as startups compete for space with shippers such 
as FedEx and traditional retailers like Macy’s , which all need to compete with Amazon  
(Bloomberg 2016; figure 12). For any company offering fast delivery via  Amazon, the demand for 
so-called in -fill properties —spaces designed in part to process individual packages rather than 
pallets of goods bound for stores —closer to population centers has also increased  (Grant 2016) . 
Prologis , which is the world’s largest warehouse owner, is building the first multistory warehouse 
in the United States, a common practice in land- scarce Asia. In September 2016, private equity  
giant Blackstone pa id US$1.5 bill ion for a portfolio of logistics centers  across the United States  
because of  the attractiveness of the sector  (Grant 2016) . 
 
Figure 12: Amazon’s Footprint in the United States  68 
  
• Inbound cross -dock centers . The purpose of t hese large- sized distribution centers is to sort the inbound flows coming from 
vendors to regional e- fulfillment centers. Since many suppliers are abroad, a large quantity of cargo arrives in containers through 
ports. So, these facilities tend to be located close to major container port or intermodal rail facilities as import containers are 
brought in to be unloaded and their contents stored. The inventory is held until required by e -fulfillment centers, mostly in the 
form of consolidated loads of various i tems.  
• E-fulfillment centers . Accounting for the most significant footprint, the purpose of e -fulfillment centers is to process and fill 
online orders. E -fulfillment centers are specialized by the type of items they handle, particularly in terms of size. Th erefor e, small 
sortable e -fulfillment centers handle items that can be combined into a small box or envelope of less than 18 inches. Large 
sortable are for items that can be combined into a large box of more than 18 inches and still be able to be handled b y stan dard 
sortation equipment such as conveyor belts. Large non -sortable are individual items that are too bulky or heavy and that require 
to be handled separately (e.g. fork lift). There are also e- fulfillment centers specializing in apparel, footwear, jewelry , dry groceries 
and perishables. The location of the fulfillment centers is related to the distribution of the American population but not ne cessarily 
based upon optimal regional market accessibility. Reducing land rent costs and tax expenses, partic ularly  sales taxes, is a core 
locational driver. The footprint of e- fulfillment centers has become stable at around 1,000,000 square foot per facility. So, as 
demand increases, Amazon does not expand the size of existing facilities, but build additional on es to expand market coverage 
and reduce lead time.  
• Sortation centers . The purpose of these distribution centers is to sort parcels coming from e- fulfillment centers towards smaller 
destination units such as postal codes. They can either be brought to a loc al pos t office or to a delivery station. These facilities are 
used to allocate which distribution system (United States Postal Services, UPS, FedEx) parcels are going to be sent through f or the 
last mile.  
• Delivery stations . Facilities often designed for th e last  step before final delivery and are located within metropolitan areas. They 
sort parcels according to well defined delivery areas that are serviced by contracted delivery companies. These facilities ar e also 
being used for the delivery of fresh goods . A la rge number are rented distribution centers of small size or reconverted facilities. 
Amazon is simply seeking to find an available footprint having accessibility to a metropolitan area, or part of a metropolita n area.  
• Prime parcel hubs . Specialized distribu tion centers carrying a limited line of items that can quickly be delivered, often in less than 
two days. Items held in inventory are selected on the basis on their high and relatively predictable demand. They are also kn own as 
Amazon Prime facilitie s and tend to be located in the largest metropolitan areas. Several are co- located with e -fulfillment centers 
so that they get quickly replenished but  are operated independently.

 In Europe, density and city structure suggest  that firms and local governments prefer smaller 
urban logistics distribution centers.  In some cases, these have even demonstrated success in 
reducing freight vehicle trips by 30 to 80 percent, distance traveled by 30 to 45 percent, vehicle 
emissions by 25 to 60 percent, and even vehicle load factors by 15 to 100 percent  (Allen and 
Brown e 2010, 291) . Some of these models —urban transshipment c enters —are developed by 
cities in partnership with private companies . For example,  the Legazpi Transshipment Center in 
Madrid provide s incentive s to companies to create environmentally  friendly local deliveries  using 
electric vans and even tricycles with c argo  baskets. Incentives include eas ing vehicle -size 
restrictions on some roads and provid ing tax breaks  (Winkenbach and Merchán 2015) . In 
Tampere, Finland, a small and somewhat ad hoc logistics center for combining municipal service 
deliveries has proved to be a great success , and the consol idation system has allowed city 
employees to spend more time on their primary missions  (Monami and others, 253 ).  
The implications for firms and policy  makers in developing countries is clear:  this is an opportunity 
to shape urban logistics spaces  while co nsidering  the demands of e -commerce . Location 
decisions for domestic distribution are just being made as companies and operations begin 
targeting new markets or become more sophisticated. In India, for instance, an analysis shows 
that according to  current productivity trends and growth estimates (2014– 15), an estimated  7.5 
million to 15 million square feet of additional fulfillment centers  with an average size of 80,000 
to 150,000 square feet each  will be built in the next three to four years . This volume represents 
an additional 6 to 12  percen t of organized warehousing space in India in the same period  (PwC  
and Assocham India 2014 ). Where should they be located? How should they be integrated with 
urban planning? These are some of the pressing questions for policy  makers in India and 
elsewhere.  Policy makers influence land use, zoning, urban planning, environmental regulations 
and such and this influences how companies and markets respond in terms of investments, and 
business models. These concerns affect  urban centers in small developing countries as much as 
they do  large cities in the OECD  or the emerging markets .  
Some of the challenges in smaller countries are augmented by the need for coordination among  
border clearance and other government services becau se the major cities are serviced by single 
facilities that also serve as c ustoms clearance points . For instance , in Lesotho, a major 
supermarket highlighted how the lack of around -the-clock  operations at the clearance facility 
cum inland terminal affects  its ability to stock shelves with fresh produce before opening time. 
The lack of this service also has implications for urban congestion during morning rush hour when 
freight trucks enter the city to deliver their goods while morning commuters begin their j ourneys.  
These current practices , which already inhibit retail sales , are unlikely to encourage e -commerce 
companies  if a demand for such services  existed . 
Eventually , different models of distribution will evolve and develop based on the type of 
economy, s tructure of cities, density, and level of development. In developing countries with 
dense urban congestion, product categories also may play a role in the type of distribution center. 
For example, b ooks may be distributed through larger central warehouses wh ile consumer 
electronics and durables,  which have lesser proliferation  of stock keeping uni ts, higher product 70 
 value , and higher security  and handling needs,  may need  a just -in-time and direct fulfillment 
model  to be put in place  (PwC and Assocham India 2 014). In contrast, g rocery delivery would 
require another type  of handling with a cool chain that would need to function despite the lack 
of adequate power supply in many of  these environments.  
Governments in developing countries are increasingly realizin g the importance of logistics spaces 
in urban environments and  are crafting policies to influence outcomes.  China’s local 
governments, which control land use, were once reluctant to authorize new warehouses because 
they generated little tax revenue . Today,  they have begun giving planning permission as they see 
the ne w jobs being created  (The Economist  2015) . Similarly , the Indian government’s recent  
sales -tax reform has begun consolidation of national distribution networks for most firms and 
could produce a  new wave of construction (The Economist  2016) . In other count ries, in Ethiopia, 
Rwanda, and Zambia, for instance , domestic distribution is still largely conducted  from inland 
container depots , warehouses , and logistics platforms  and parks that often serve as customs 
bonded warehouses . The small market size in these countries  and the focus on consolidation  and 
deconsolidation  for export and import  often drive these facility investment decisions.  
The delivery vehicle  
E-commerce companies need robust supply chains and flexible and efficient logistics networks as 
they c ompete in their ability to stock, store, ship, and deliver more items than physical stores 
with minimal friction for consumers.  However, as discussed earlier, the previous focus of this 
freight traffic was on large distribution centers outside of cities for delivering goods to business 
districts and commercial centers. Today, the need to deliver packages to residential customers is 
driving businesses and cities to review  the old supply chai n and logistics conf igurations , as well 
as the delivery vehicle. Moreover, this downstream package delivery business is increasingly time 
sensitive , with consumers demanding quick delivery times. Combined with just -in-time delivery 
of upstream manufacturing, the  logistics system is expected to rely on the ability of trucks (and 
other competing types of delivery vehicles) to maintain a consistent schedule. To deliver e -
commerce products to residential consumers , parcel delivery companies and logistics operators 
face multiple challenges: smaller shipments, fragmented goods flow, multiple destinations, 
higher frequency, and consignee delivery issues  (such as  special delivery time requests, a wait in 
line to make deliveries/collections, or difficulty  in finding the re ceiver  [Allen and Browne 2010,  
286; Monami and others 245 –46].They also face  a lack of coordination among urban freight 
actors.  
Generally, most logistics companies find t he last mile to be  the most difficult and expensive leg 
of a package’s  journey and a key problem fo r distribution . As mentioned earlier, in developed  
economies this can often account for up to  50 percent % of the delivery cost  (DMCC 2016) . 
Perhaps, because of this, Amazon and other firms focus on using  and exploring all possible 
options to reconfigure last mile delivery. These options range from adopting drone t echnologies  
to reconfiguring receiving points ( see discussion on receiving point ) to eagerly awaiting the 
revolution  in autonomous vehicles , which will have implications for small urb an deliveries  with 
the growth of e -commerce. Some of these options are discussed in more detail later in this 
section.  71 
 Urban freight traffic is growing , and in most countries , this has implications for trucks on roads . 
The share of freight traffic in citie s may depend on several  factors such as  the type, size , and 
location of city and the time of day , though the average is typically low . A study in Rome 
conducted before the rise of e -commerce estimated  this share at 12  percent  (Nuzzolo and Comi  
2012) , even though up to 80 percent of the freight for a local destination is carried by a truck  
(Reisman 2011) . In the United States, nationally, in 2010, trucking was the largest freight mode 
by weight (68 percent) and value (65 percent) , and the trucked value of go ods is expected to 
more than double by 2040  (Eisele and others 2013) . Lack of coordination among urban freight 
actors in part contributes to declining load factors‖ (that is, more empty trucks on the road), 
which was observed in a Tokyo freight traffic study and is regarded as a typical problem.  Likewise, 
circulation traff ic—meaning round trips, distribution, or pick -up trips —accounts for much of the 
urban freight movement  (Reisman 2011) . A study in Germany fou nd that 60 to 65 percent of all 
freight trips (in this case, about 290,000 of 460,000 daily trips) was  due to circulating traffic, which 
carried only 28 percent of the goods being exchanged (Giuliano xxxx, 72– 73). In developing 
countries, cities are often located near ports , major centers , or borders , and thus,  highways often 
go through cities ( such as  Nairobi and Momb asa in Kenya and Maseru in Lesotho ) and 
significantly affect  logistics, time , and cost , as well as  local congestion.  
“Home delivery routes o f e-commerce shipments typically consist of 50 to 150 stops per day, 
depending on the type of vehicle,”  [ Matthias Winkenbach, Center for Transportation and 
Logistics] . With the rapid growth in e -commerce , even more pressure will be exerted  on delivery 
companies to find environmentally friendly solutions as governments respond to the challenges 
of increased density, po llution , and congestion. In areas w here trucks are used, their efficiency 
and flexibility  come with costs  as they operate on  public infrastructure, compete for space with 
other road users, move  throughout the entire urban area, and generate more pollution and  
safety concerns than competing modes . Trucks are both the freight  transportation mode of 
greatest concern to most cities and the  mode that local governments can most effectively control  
(Holloway, Spahr, and Rhodes -Conway 2014 ). Policy  makers are often  concerned with emissions 
in urban areas because  the health risks reduce as air disperses and the concentration levels are 
far higher in urban areas than in the countryside. As such, policy  makers designate truck routes 
to reduce negative effects  of pollution, noise, and vibration.  Moreover,  peak delivery traffic 
around holidays can only add to these woes ( see Figure 13 below)  
Figure 13: Peak Delivery  72

Route planning and optimization lie at the core  of effective last mile delivery.  For firms , this 
means getting more deliveries on fewer vehicles that drive fewer miles  (SupplyChainBrain 2016) . 
They help drive satisfaction levels up and total cost to service the customer down. Moreover, f or 
last mile de livery, routes can be extremely dynamic, changing day to day (sometimes within the 
day) as compared with typical service routes that vary little from one week to the next  
(SupplyChainBrain 2016) . With the growth in e -commerce and the increase in parcel delivery to 
residential neighborhoods , firms optimiz e freight routes not only need to keep costs low but need 
to deal with the rules and regulations set by policy  makers , which often can throw well -designed 
logistics distribution systems out of gear. A parkin g ban in Rio de Janeiro led the local Coca -Cola 
Company  bottler to change its final delivery mode to motorcycle. The large  delivery  trucks are 
now parked at designated sites where they transfer product to the motorcycles  (Winkenbach and 
Merchán 2015 ). Thes e mobile warehouses provide flexibility (peak demand and congestion), 
speed and transfer capabilities in distribution, and compliance with parking regulations and 
reduction in emissions  (Merchán and Blanco 2015 ). Others note, that this can also have perverse 
implications  where companies don’t think through their distribution models carefully i.e. the 
73 
 restrictions  can lead  to an increase in the number of vehicles because companies split the load 
into smaller vehicles . In San Francisco , Amazon  uses  hundreds o f Amazon -brande d white trucks 
that are dispatched from a large  warehouse near the airport  to service customers seven days a 
week  (Bensinger  and Stevens 2016 ). Firms often use the option of flexibility at the receiving point 
(discussed in the next section) , which  include s off-peak delivery ( though often requiring 
regulatory change ), unattended delivery, drop boxes, and designated collection sites . 
An additional challenge hampering delivery vehicles is the lack of visibility in th e last mile . 
Traditionally, t here was little  inventory tracking once products were loaded  on the final delivery 
vehicle , that is,  the last mile was invisible . Recently,  companies have leveraged technology to 
extend  this visibility to the final destination. However, this visibility is frequently  available to only 
the logistics delivery companies , which are often contracted third parties. Amazon, perhaps 
recognizing this early , has rolled out various initiatives in this space that seem to suggest a 
straddling of the logistics provider’s space. It has  purchas ed thousands of truck trailers, applied  
for an  ocean freight forwarding license, registered  with the Securities and Exchange Commission  
as a transportation company , and set up its own last  mile delivery service in select cities  (Ray 
2016) . Some analysts have speculated that this investment (in last mile delivery) could be 
available as a third -party delivery service  for other companies , improving the viability of those 
very investments and expanding the scope for making more of them as they become 
economically feasible. However, other  e-commerce firms who may not make similar decisions as 
Amazon will still need visibility to optimize operations and find innovative solutions. Although  
last mile deliveries  for e -commerce  in congested Asian cities have  foregone the use of trucks33 
and the consequent problem of under used  assets with large upfront investments , visibility is 
further hampered by payment and security problems  and lack of postal addresses ( discussed in 
the next section).  
The last leg of the freight system is challenging for both the city, whose concerns include 
optimizing capacity and safety of streets for all users, and the shippers, who wish to minimize 
logistics costs (and obtain visibility) without adversely affecting c ustomer s ervice  (SDOT 2008) . 
Thus,  policy  makers should not always  focus  on large  projects such as  setting up urban 
distribution centers . Instead, they should concentrate on  location decisions on spacing of 
warehousing districts and pay attention to the wa y transpo rtation is likely to be used to distribute  
goods. These aspects are  essential to creating not only successful urban communities but also 
lower  cost, environmentally friendly logistics operations that are likely to be needed with the 
growth of e -commerce.  
Growth in trade and commerce often makes the freight system inefficient and disruptive . In 
developing countries, firms and policy  makers will need to think of innovative solutions that work 
for their environments and learn from good practice. Globally, citi es have tackled these 
challenges through a multiplicity of solutions that include adding infrastructure capacity (new 
roads and rail lines, new lanes  on existing roads, lanes dedicated to trucks, and additional lanes 
and docking facilities at warehouses an d distribution centers  [Eisele and others 2013]), regulatory 
                                                      
33 With exceptions , where small commercial vehicles are used for larger electronics, furniture , and other bulky items , two 
wheelers are typically used to deliver packages and maneuver around narrow roads and alleys.  74 
 changes both domestic (access and restrictions related) and cross -border (customs and other 
border control),  and firm -level practices (operating practices or changes in  the operating hours 
of fre ight facilities, delivery schedules, or manufacturing plants  [Eisele and others 2013] ). These 
changes then influence  firms and logistics networks.  
Companies are continuing to innovate with less or more technology to deal with ro ad space and 
urban infrastr ucture and policy constraints.  A Boston -area company, Metro Pedal Power, uses 
pedal  trucks (bicycles with trailers attached) to haul up to 500 pounds of localized freight. Metro 
Pedal Power’s eco -friendly solutions for last mile delivery in urban areas fill a not -insignificant 
niche in the urban freight world, primarily moving small loads from a local origin to a local 
destination. Businesses and organizations such as bakeries, retail shops, and nonprofits use these 
human- powered logistics services in place  of fossil -fueled services for local hauling, including 
recycling and compost pick -up (Reisman 2011) . E-commerce companies have tried  using Uber, 
newspaper carriers, and citizen couriers for deliveries . These solutions are certainly not new for 
developing countries , where smaller, more localized delivery vehicles like two wheelers 
(motorcycles and scooters), three wheelers, and cycle rickshaw carts have been used for decades , 
much before the advent of e -commerce. Some of these options are obviously slower, limited to 
small loads , and often labor intensive. Other solutions being employed use  a heavy dose of 
technology to innovatively adapt current delivery modes . An example is the urban logistics 
location movement matching demand to  supply. These new matching  models , like Uber for 
passengers,  from companies such as Transfix can help reduce many of the challenges faced by 
both firms (cost reduction) and policy  makers (congestion and pollution). In the hypothetical 
example from Transfix in figure 1 4, an automate d matching solution would cut delivery from 
1,752 miles to 254 miles , benefiting firms, policy  makers , and communities  (Jaffe 2015).  In China, 
the merger of Huochebang with Yunmanman creates a company with the scale to rationalize an 
inefficient and often chaotic industry in the country by providing a large, computerized 
dispatching agency  for transformative national transportation  (Bloomberg , 2017).

New developments like autonomous vehicles highlight ho w policy  makers continue to be 
challenged when faced with exponential ly advancing  technologies.  Automated delivery tests 
have also proliferated over the past couple of years. For example, s ix convoys of platoons  without 
drivers , in groups of two or three trucks —communicating wirelessly and driving closely behind 
one another —arrived by public road in Rotterdam in April 2016  (Lehmacher 2016) . Although  
autonomous trucking will probably  be ready for service before policy and infrastructure catch up, 
its use on city streets is likely to take quite some time .  
The array  and complexity of regulatory questions for policy  makers range from commercial laws  
to trucking regulations  and from  traffic laws to liability laws. Issues of enforcement and physical 
and cyber safety will also require robust debates. Infrastructure concerns would include  
redesigning highways , that is,  whether dedicated highways or  dedicated lanes or other 
infrastructure elements would be conducive for safer roads . In Singapore , which has plans to 
become the leading development center for autonomous vehicles (see box 3), plans are 
underway to develop an autonomous truck platooning system  closely following on the heels of 
the autonomous taxi testing conducted recently . Delivery s olutions that include  ground robots, 
drones, and river shuttles are being tested around the world to tackle the very c omplex task of 
last mile delivery as supply chains become more fluid and continuous. This note does not seek to 
discuss these developments in detail but only to  highlight that these technologies offer both 
opportunities and challenges for policy  makers and  companies alike to rethink last mile logistics 
and that stakeholders would be needed across the wide spectrum to cooperate and collaborate 
with one another. Innovation in this space , like elsewhere,  is often not slow, linear, or 
76 
 incremental as technologie s advance in an exponential way and governments are often unable 
to keep up  (Overly 2016) . 
 
 
The receiving point  
Today’s consumers in  the e -commerce world may demand immediate delivery but are not always 
available to receive their packages. This is of great concern to delivery companies and e -
commerce firms because  (a) multiple visits to homes and offices have costs ; (b) unattended 
delivery is not always possible , particularly with consumers increasingly purchasin g high -value 
items ; and (c) in many developing countries , finding the correct  address and appropriate 
recipient can be a challenge. Although  firms are often rolling out innovative solutions in OECD 
count ries (Deutsche Post DHL’s automated Packstations  in Germany34) or partnering with postal 
services for weekend delivery , firms in developing countries face a different set of challenge s. 
These include mapping addresses and coordinates, confirming delivery, c ollecting payment and 
returns , and, in general, organ izing the logistics around a set of supply chain issues for which they 
have little visibility. Some of these challenges are discussed below.  
An UNCTAD ( 2015)  study notes that almost 60 countries lack  a postcode system. One of the 
biggest challenges in developing countries is the issue of addresses. In numerous mega cities with 
dense urban neighborhoods, delivery  persons  often call the recipient numerous times while 
wandering narrow alleys and lanes to rec onfirm directions.  Where government s fail, markets and 
technology are stepping in and firms are innovating to address these constraints. In India, the  
startup Delhivery is using machine learning to subdivide  India’s postcodes to map idiosyncratic 
descripti ons (The Economist  2016) . In Kenya , OkHi seek s to assign physical addresses to people 
who do  not have one  (UNCTAD 2015) . In June 2016, Aramex International announced a US $3 
million investment in what3words, which assigns a unique series of three words to e very 10-foot 
by 10 -foot square of the Earth’s surface. Aramex said it plans to use what3words for e -commerce 
deliveries in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia  (Phillips 2016b) . Although  some of these firms are 
                                                      
34 In Germany, Deutsche Post DHL operates automated Packsta tions , which are networks of lockers located for convenient 
parcel pickup by individuals that offer an alternative to home delivery . They are  a variation of the mail dropbox with better 
use of techno logy (http://www.wsj.com/articles/guest- voices -delivery -companies -are-redefining -the-last- mile -in-
crowded -cities -). Box 3: Singapore’s Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Drive  
“The appropriate first- mover unit of innovation is not the car, or even the car company,” 
writes innovation consultant Chunka Mui (2016) in Strategy+Business. “It is the nation.” 
Singapore’s government has invited developers of self -driving cars to relocate to the island 
nation to avoid what he called “the tangled web of competition, policy fights, re gulatory 
hurdles and entrenched interests governing the pace of driverless -car development and 
deployment in the U.S.” (Crovitz 2016).  77 
 independent of the postal services, others like Aramex have joined up with delivery  and postal 
services in Brazil and Mongolia to reach neighborhoods and regions without address systems.  
Even where delivery points have been located, some packages still require signatures  and often 
inspection , and payme nt needs to be collected  from the buyer . In developing countries , proof of 
delivery is often based on having a signature . Sometimes , even a signature may not be enough,  
and being able to attribute a time and place, such as using a time and latitude –longitu de stamp, 
offers  greater security and proof that a package was delivered  (Cohen 2015b) . However, e ven 
with the identification of the delivery point, the issue of payment has vexed e -commerce 
companies across the developing world. In India, cash is s till po pular despite  an increas e in credit 
card transactions in recent years. Moreover, e -commerce buyers prefer to inspect the product 
upon delivery before paying for it with  cash. Although different e -commerce companies in the 
country offer other options —credit  card terminals at time of delivery , use of mobile money , and 
an option to pick up at the local kirana (corner) store —cash transactions still dominate. Thus,  
delivery persons  may often  carry large amounts of cash —a risky proposition . Though courier 
companies have begun upgrading their services in the country to offer a menu of options, often 
they lack the ability to handle cash on delivery  and returns and address  other consumer 
complaints. This has led some etailers to create their own delivery networks similar to A mazon’s 
investm ents in logistics networks in the United States  or to use the postal services as Amazon h as 
done in India .  
Consumer s in developed  economies demand a system where by they expect to receive whatever 
they want when they want it. During  the busy holiday , this is a challenge . With e -commerce 
volumes expected to increase , urban planners will need to determine how to manage scarce road 
and pavement space as a steady increas e in trucks occupies space for unloading. Policy  makers 
do not use technology and data to allocate parking, curb space, package delivery  times , 
restrictions  on space use , and so on,  unlike consumers who can order consumables in a variety 
of sizes and color s at the click of a button. The  complexity of returns and failed deliveries only 
adds to the challenge.   
These current conditions in last mile logistics and the continued growth of e -commerce combined 
suggest  that without changes , the last mile delivery systems will become chokepoints for the 
growth of e -commerce. Perhaps foreseeing this  possibility,  companie s are testing alternate 
systems (Amazon with its drone deliveries, Sunday deliveries with the postal service , and so on,  
and Google and others with their  autonomous vehicles) , reconfiguring how consignees receive 
packag es, and helping  address issues relate d to last mile delivery.  However, these problems also 
require policy solutions that could help reduce the effect  of these problems (discussed in another 
section ). 
Remote Connectivity  
Digital technologies have spread quickly as the number of Internet users has more than tripled 
in a decade to an estimated 3.2 billion at the end of 2015 . There are compelling examples of how 
ICTs have benefited firms, people , and governments by significan tly reducing the costs of 
economic a nd social transactions and yield ing real benefits.  These technologies can expand the 
information base, allowing online traders in remote areas to connect to global markets.  They also 78 
 lower the information cost, because  firms can access government services that are being 
provided at a lower cost and with greater efficiency  (World Bank 2016) .  
Nonetheless, though  there are many success stories, the aggregate effect of digital technologies 
so far has been smaller than expected . The digital divide is still larg e; nearly 60 percent of the 
world’s people are still offline and cannot fully participate in the digital economy  (World Bank 
2016) . Residents in rural communities continue to  face numerous challenges in enjoying the 
bene fits of e -commerce. Often connectivi ty to the Internet for e -commerce itself is a challenge. 
Rather than  discuss how best to reach these businesses and consumers , this section focuses on 
those who are connected and covered and the barriers they face in rel ation to trade logistics and 
facilit ation. The postal operator, a  key stakeholder to potentially enable that connectivity , was 
discussed in an earlier section.  
Logistics and distribution infrastructure in remote areas is often unavailable because  e-
commerc e retailers and third -party logistic s providers cannot justify investments based on the 
volumes available to make them sustainable . In many countries , the models employed by e -
commerce retailers have focused on being asset light , affecting  investment in th e sector. Some 
others , such as  Alibaba , realized that China’s woefully inefficient logistics network acted as a 
brake on e -commerce growth and organized Cainiao, a consortium that runs a digital platform 
linking more than a dozen logistics providers, 1,800  distribution centers , and more than 100,000 
dispatch points  (The Economist 2015) . The implications for rural connectivity —the enabling 
conditions  that includ e the hard assets , whether these are the roads , ICT, or telecom 
connectivity —often need to be fixed by someone else. This also applies  to distribution and 
logistics infrastructure.  Where these assets exist , they can perhaps be reconfigured or be 
converted for mixed use , but otherwise , they  often need substantial primary investments .  
In some countries, e -commerce operators eventually mak e hard investments because  no 
alternative options  exist . JD.com,  an Alibaba competit or in China, has spent sizeable sums 
developing warehouses and logistics networks and taken an asset -heavy approach  to e -
commerce akin to Amazon’s method in the United Stat es. JD.com , Tencent , and Baidu have 
invested in online -to-offline deals following this model  (The Economist  2015) . Alibaba is now 
building service centers in remote areas where shoppers can order, pick up , and sell goods, as 
well as pay their bills. This  is a step  further in its attempts not merely to benefit from the growth 
in Chinese consumption, but to shape and accelerate that consumption. The degree to which it 
has succeeded suggests that the ear lier an e -commerce company arrives in a country’s 
develop ment, the wider might be its role  (The Economist  2016) . JD.com meanwhile plans to 
increase services to rural areas by building 185 drone airports in southwest China by 2020 
(Reuters, 2018)  and considering buying its own planes (SCMP, 2018) . 
The effect of sector regulations in logistics and retail on these decisions is sometimes striking . In 
India, regulations do not allow foreign -backed e -commerce firms to own inventory35, thus 
affecting  their ability to fulfill orders . As such , the big companies are all first and foremost 
                                                      
35 E-Commerce c ompanies will not be permitted to have more than 25  percent  of their sales come from one vendor, even if that 
vendor is the co mpany itself , thus affecting the business model . 79 
 marketplaces. Not owning inventory has implications for investment in distribution systems in 
remote areas and therefore rural penetration.  Cost control also  becomes an issu e in a country 
where supply chain in efficiencies are still high . Although the possibility that this would prevent 
India’s e -commerce companies from creating service centers akin to Alibaba in China is unclear, 
it certainly make s servicing rural consumers a less attractive proposition. The implications for e -
commerce  are t hat although the market may  drive development in this sector , if countries are to 
benefit, then governments have a role in ensuring that sector policies are modern, transparent , 
and simplified. Logistics sector investment and innovation is often stymied by  poor regulation  in 
other countries , too. For example,  in Ethiopia,  foreign logistics providers are not welcome , but  
private sector operators  cannot effectively participate in e -commerce , even if they wanted to,  
because of a combination of crucial factors —inability to raise capital, in ability to access land , 
confusion over customs bonded regulations ; and inability  to set up private customs bonded 
warehouses.  
The different types  of marketplaces and e -commerce business models may also affect the ability 
of rural consumers and producers to participate . In India , for instance , B2C marketplaces ( such 
as Flipkart) allow only registered firms to participate , though this is not often required for C2C 
firms in the e -commerce world ( such as  eBay).  For rural artisans in remote communities , 
participatio n may be hampered because  they need first to register through a government 
process —fulfill an enabling condition —before  even getting to the point where they need to 
organize logistics for delivery. However,  participation in a C2C marketplace often means  that 
order fulfillment  (holding inventory, packing and shipping, managing customer relationships , and 
handling  returns and exchanges ) need s to be done in house , which is often difficult for rural 
SMEs. In contrast, t he chal lenges facing remote consumers extend beyond receiving goods to 
paying for them. They are more likely to use cash to pay for goods , which means  delivery 
companies need to develop mechanisms for managing cash  in these remote areas . SMEs in rural 
outposts ma y face further challenges where third- party private providers do not offer such 
services.  
The kinds of goods produced by rural artisans and SMEs in remote  markets also influence their 
ability to sell online  because  logistics costs matter even more . If they  sell food products that are 
perishable but fill a niche market (that is,  rare or unusual or a geographic specialty or other less 
perishable goods ), their  chance of success is more likely. However, distance and low volumes 
affect costs , and commoditized pr oducts will not  be competitive . Only the very entrepreneurial 
producer will connect using a digital platform , while  most others will sell locally or to 
consolidators .  
Government ’s role in enabling e -commerce connectivity for remote communities needs to be  
determined through careful analysis and consideration. In Thailand, the government established 
over 1 ,800 telecenters that provided computers and free Internet access to local communities. 
Websites were also set  up to market products and services. However, usage rates  were very low , 
and the initiative was largely considered a failure . Nevertheless, some  rural communities have 
successfully navigated e -commerce markets. In Suichang, a community of 50,000 people in a 
mountainous and forested area in Zhejiang Province , China , residents  sold bamboo products 
online and each household earned  over 120,000 renmin bi. The local government contributed by 80 
 building road infrastructure and ICT connectivity  (UNCTAD 2015) . More generally , local  
governments in China have often provided tax incentives and preferential loans for construction 
of logistics infrastructure (for example,  warehouses ) rather than directly building the second-
order infrastructure themselves.  These differing examples highlight how the role of the 
govern ment needs to be carefully crafted and perhaps be one that is more enabling and focused 
on access pr ovision rather than on activities that are best left to  the private sector.  
The infrastructure and service provision for rural consumers and producers is developing 
differently across markets . In certain economies, private providers are enabling the conne ctivity 
with or without government help. In others , governments are attempting to bridge the gaps 
themselves , and in still others , there is no government re sponse. Without regional integration, 
in many smaller developing countries , the lack of population d ensity, the market size , and the 
geography will continue to hinder access for consumers and businesses to participate in the e -
commerce marketplaces.  
Reduci ng Costs t hrough Regional I ntegration  
For many small markets , the challenges of cross -border commerce and the opportunities it 
provides can be harnessed through stronger regional integration.  The b enefits of regional 
integration are well known , and this no te only highlights  how those benefits that lead to 
reduction in costs for traders and consumers are particularly critical for the e -commerce sector. 
Typically , foreign firms invest, produce , and sell in countries according to  a host of calculations , 
one of  which includes market size. Regional integration enables fir ms, foreign or domestic , to sell 
to a larger common market and often lead s to lower prices and more choice for consumers. For 
SMEs, as discussed earlier in this note, e -commerce opens  markets tha t otherwise would be 
difficult  to reach. For developing count ry SMEs , navigating neighboring markets because of 
better regional integration would greatly enhance their reach and potential.  
Regional Integration efforts focused on e -commerce are underway in  some regional economic 
communities  (RECs ), though most are still at a nascent stage.  In 2013, the EU developed a 
roadmap for (a) completing the s ingle market  for parcel delivery with the objectives of i ncreas ing 
transparency and information  (by calling fo r web comparison tools  and collection of market data 
on domestic and cross -border parcel flows  and e ncouraging voluntary codes of conduct or codes 
of good practice ); (b) improv ing the  availability, quality , and affordability of delivery solutions  (by 
devel oping solutions to better interconnect info rmation systems to allow data exchange, 
facilitate tracking and tracing and labeling,  and provide for effective returns ); and (c) enhanc ing 
complaint handling and redress mechanisms for consumers  (European Commiss ion 2013) . Other 
regions too have identifie d this as an area of focus . ASEAN  has been trying to harmonize 
legislation , including that  for electronic transactions, consumer protection, data protection and 
privacy, cybercrime,  content regulation, and domain names and dispute resolution. I n Latin 
America, many countries have signed trade agreements that include provisions on e -commerce 
with both regional and extraregional trade partners  and include those of the Central American 
Common Market, Colombia, and the  Dominican Republic and , to a lesser extent , Chile, Peru, and 81 
 the CARIFORUM (Caribbean Forum of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States ) 
countries  (Estevadeordal 2017) . 
In some cases, RECs have clearly identified the need to focus on facilitatio n and logistics for e -
commerce. The EU’s Digital Single Market Strategy published in 2015 listed , among others , parcel 
delivery and e -commerce as being crucial for the EU economy .36. The strategy highlight s the 
importance of fast and efficient parcel delive ry service for a competitive e -comme rce market and 
lists high costs, lack of transparency , and inconvenience of cross -border delivery of parcels 
ordered online as limiting factors. The E uropean Commission  outlined action to improve 
regulatory oversight while supporting innovation;  ensuring a  level playing field for operators ; and 
address ing the issue of price transparency, including prices of small shipments . In May 2016 , the 
commission  adopted a  proposal for a regulation on cross -border parcel delivery services that will  
mitigate the challenges covering  price transparency and regulatory oversight of cross -border 
parcel delivery services so that individual consumers and small etailers can benefit from more 
afforda ble deliveries and convenient return options,  even to and from peripheral regions  
(European Commission 2016) . The r egulation will give national postal regulators the data they 
need to monitor cross -border markets and check the affordability of prices. It w ill also encourage 
competition by requiring transparent and nondiscriminatory third -party access to certain cross -
border parcel delivery services and infrastructure. The c ommission will publish the public list 
prices of universal service providers to incre ase peer competition and tariff transparency.  The 
proposal complements self -regulatory initiatives to improve the quality and convenience of 
cross -border parcel delivery services linked to the roadmap for completing the s ingle market for 
parcel delivery .  
For many developing countries, harmonizing laws and regulations to reduce transaction costs  
with their neighbors or in the RECs with whom they participate would be an important first step.  
For instance, e -transaction, e-signature , and data protection laws that are harmonized in a 
subregion together  with common frameworks for e -payment , including mobile banking , would 
help promote e -commerce  like the practices of  ASEAN . However , differences in legal approaches, 
absence of good regulators, resource constraint s, and slow legislative processes , among othe r 
issues, typically hamper regional harmonization initiatives in general,  even in those regional 
economic communities that are considered more forward looking. A second step related to this 
is in general to deve lop common approaches to regulatory issues like  the lines of what the EU 
has done. A third step could be to look at drafting a strategy for the REC on e -commerce that 
would lay out a roadmap of plans and goals for countries ’ anticipated achievements .  
A fourth step  could be to ensure that national efforts , particularly those related to the TFA articles 
that would enhance e -commerce are  fully implemented.  For instance, a common de minimis 
amongst trading partners (discussed earlier), could  be amongst such steps.  A fifth step could be 
for trading partn ers to coordinate responses to last mile connectivity in border regions. While 
many initiatives in this effort would be mainstream trade facilitation and logistics improvements 
– the impact th ey are likely to have on ecommerce where such potential exists is unlikely to be 
                                                      
36 The digital economy is expected to contribute € 415 billion to the EU economy each year and create hundreds of 
thousands of new jobs.  82 
 insignificant. A sixth step would be for trading partners to develop common approaches to air 
transport that would include a roadmap and provide for market access that would help expand 
the potential of ecommerce.  
Conclusion 
E-Commerce is transforming  global  trade  and is growing at a rate of four times faster than the 
world economy. However,  poor trade facilitation and logistics can limit a country, its firms and 
consumers from reaping the benefits of this economic opportunity.  
Drawing fro m a wide array of developments and literature, and from work done by the WBG 
more generally in trade facilitation and logistics, t his note identifies the various issues and 
challenges relating  to facilitation and logistics for e -commerce  and identifies potential solutions, 
particularly those in which the World Bank Group (WBG) can play a role in helping developing 
countries.  
From a trade facilitation perspective,  the note makes the case for  establishing the building blocks 
to enable the necessary improvemen t to countries’ abilities to participate and benefit from e -
commerce. Such improvements begin with the need for improvement programs for creating a 
more conducive legal environment for automat ion. Trade  facilitation reform brings th is legal 
requirement  to light and puts it in context  aspects of data protection and privacy, validity of 
electronic transactions and data sharing , particularly during the implementation of automation 
systems like ele ctronic single windows and port community systems . A further bui lding block is  
improving automation and interconnectivity between government agencies ; examples include  
the publishing of trade and advance information online, and national single window systems that 
has brought together many trade -related agencies to proc ess permits, certificates, and electronic 
payments online through a single system . Combined,  these automation initiatives present a  
unique opportunity to make proce dures more transparent and efficient, as well as more  
connected and predictable through ICT .  
Often countries find dealing with small consignments processed through e -commerce 
transactions challenging for multiple reasons,  including the amount of resources  required, 
particularly where automation is not fully deployed . However, some s pecific facilitation 
measures that improve the efficiency of trade transactions can significantly affect e -commerce 
and SMEs that are trying to take advantage of it such as the use of a de minimi s threshold, having 
a simplified declarations regime and pre -arrival proce ssing form further building blocks for 
enabling an e -commerce environment . In addition to those already mentioned, there are also 
further initiatives that can improve the e -commerce environment for business and consumers 
alike, the se are more specifically detailed within the WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement , the 
implementation of  which provides a further block to establishing good facilitation foundations 
for e-commerce.  
From a logistics perspective , the note discusses the importance of the role of postal  services in 
the enabling of e -commerce and their need for postal operators to  not only continue to adapt to 
new developments but also better integrate with Customs operations . Such integration can 83 
 reduce the steps involved in cargo clearance procedures an d this in turn results in lowers costs 
and better  services  to the consumer , allow ing postal  operators to better compete with private 
sector logistics firms . The note further recommen ds that there is a critical need to improve the 
logistics of last mile delivery and remote connectivity , such improvements such as more 
standardized packaging, better route planning, optimization across transportation modes, and 
tracking of returned products  can lower logistics costs without significant investments in new 
techno logy or business models and government policy.   
Additionally, the recommendation is made to also seek stronger regional integration  which 
enables firms to sell to a larger common market and often leads to lower prices and more choice 
for consumers. For SME s, e-commerce opens markets that otherwise would be difficult to reach. 
Allowing SMEs to navigat e neighboring markets because of be tter regional integration would 
greatly enhance their reach and potential.  
The above -mentioned recommendations, on both a fac ilitation and logistics , are  further detailed 
within a policy action matrix  presented in the Appendix. The matrix attaches to each action 
recommendation a priority, an assessment of  its impact and examples of the countries that have 
or are implementing  the action . The intention is that the matrix highlights potential opportunities 
for WBG support to its clients through identification of any gaps in policy support where they 
might exist and potential to priori tize that support.  
E-commerce offers new challeng es and opportunities for governments and firms , but to 
maximize its benefits requires significant reform. This note has set out a path for countries to 
continuing  the reform and modernization route with recommendations and an action matrix of 
specific impr ovements to the trade facilitation and logistics enviro nment that will better position 
countries and firms to take advantage of the enormous potential that e -commerce offers.
