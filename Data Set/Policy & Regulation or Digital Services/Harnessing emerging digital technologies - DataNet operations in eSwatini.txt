ICT profile of eSwatini1
The government of eSwatini has been inclining toward 
e-governance with the sole purpose of enabling the general public to have access to information via its website. The administration desires to be effective and provides some empowerment straight to the palm of the public. To set up a user-friendly and instructive website, the government rec-ognizes the need for the public to adapt to the use of mod-ern technology. To progress toward Vision 2022, the Program of Action (2014–2018) was published with aimed growth through agriculture, tourism, information, commu-nication, and technology as the nation emerges as a grow-ing economy in the region.
The eSwatini Development Index (SDI) was used as a 
monitoring tool and classified into the following areas: economic prosperity, agriculture and environmental sus-tainability, education, health, government service delivery, infrastructure, governance, and corruption (World Bank, 2018).Access to the Internet has increased over time. In the 
past, satellite connectivity was used for data communica-tion. Countries located beside the coast can derive the benefit provided by the submarine fiber optic cable. Landlocked countries like eSwatini are dependent on neighboring countries to access the submarine fiber optic cable. This geographic disadvantage delayed the intro-duction of the Internet into eSwatini. A monopoly in the telecommunication sectors of eSwatini existed for a long time and was put an end to only recently. In 1995, eSwatini got the first Internet connection through two Harnessing emerging digital

Abstract
This case study focuses on the impressive work carried out by DataNet. Their dedicated and innovative strategies helped develop the economy of eSwatini (formerly known as Swaziland). This case aims to demonstrate how this ingenious organization promoted eSwatini’s revenue to increase fourfold with DataNet’s advice regarding tax issues. DataNet also successfully executed numerous projects for the government of eSwatini. To name a few, DataNet has implemented the National Fire and Emergency Response System, Customs Automation, Scholarship Systems, as well as Surveillance System—a 
few of which were milestones for the company and eSwatini’s government. DataNet assimilates services tailored to the client’s needs with their technologies, including Internet of Things, high-performance computing, machine learning, big data platform, and their application on several industries, for example, education, finance, and health security and health. Challenges were encountered by DataNet while working in eSwatini; poor governance, lower Internet penetration rate, and the lack of a skilled workforce were real setbacks. Nonetheless, DataNet has been successful in leaving its mark in over six countries, covering three continents.

Internet service providers (ISPs) with 4.8 and 9.6 kbps 
speed leased and dial-up lines. Broadband Internet con-
nection was introduced into the country in 2008, although the mobile phone was available since 1998 (OAfrica, 2014). In 2011, the number of fixed telephone subscrib-ers was highest for eSwatini, 6.25% of the total popula-tion, while the number of mobile cellular phone subscribers was 63.22%. The statistics show the popular -
ity of the mobile cellular phone in comparison with the fixed phone in eSwatini. Since 2012, the number of fixed telephone subscribers started to decline, and it was 3.22% of the total population in 2016. On the other hand, mobile cellular phones’ popularity was sustained, amounting to 76.30% of the total population in 2016. As of 2016, total Internet users mounted up to 414,724 people that made up 28.6% of the population (The World Factbook, 2018; Table 1).
Although eSwatini gained Internet connection in 
1995, the penetration rate of the Internet began growing from 2011. Since 2000, only 0.90% of the total popula-tion acquired access to the Internet, and it surged to 18.10% of the total population in 2011. Table 2 displays statistics regarding the number of Internet users and the Internet penetration rate for eSwatini from 2000 to 2016. Until 2016, there have been 995,000 total mobile cellular subscriptions with 68 subscriptions per 100 inhabitants.
Although the number of total Internet users in eSwatini 
comprises less than 50% of its total population, eSwatini initiated an automated customs declaration system in 2009 (UNCTD). In terms of telecommunications’ regulatory authority, up until 2011, eSwatini Post and Telecommunication (SPTC) owned and played a signifi-cant role as an industry regulator, the state-owned posts and telecommunications operator. However, there was noticeable friction between their partnerships with mobile telephone networks (MTN) where they had a role to play in the mobile network. In late 2013, breakthrough changes in the telecommunications sector could be witnessed when a new independent regulatory authority was established. The SPTC was permitted a unified license regime in early 2016—where they could offer any or all services with the technology of their choice during their operation to encour -
age greater participation. A second mobile license had been released in 2017 to “locally own Swazi Mobile.” Moreover, MTN Swaziland fortified a spectrum in the 1800 MHz scale in the hopes of delivering long-term evo-
lution (LTE) services. Reinforced by a network sharing agreement with MTN, Swazi Mobile has inaugurated 2G, 3G, and LTE services, supported by a network sharing agreement with MTN (Budde, 2018). eSwatini witnessed an increase in the average growth in their mobile market penetration despite subscriber growth being on the decline. It was logical to believe that competition would enhance productivity and make the economy more progressive. Swazi people had the first option to choose when 2G/3G/4G First World Network was introduced on 27 July 2017. eSwatini was the first ever to offer voice-over-LTE and T able 1.

video-over-LTE (V oLTE), which has the most far-reaching 
LTE coverage (1800 and 800 MHz 4G LTE network access 
layers being brought into effective action). This allows users to use unlimited data, thus allowing them to become accustomed to e-commerce using only their cell phones (Swazi Observer, 2018). In the Internet sector, specifically, four licensed ISPs were primarily responsible. Regardless of the open competition that these ISPs provided, market penetration was low though the prices were prolonged to be high. In 2008, digital subscriber line (DSL) was finally made known to the Swazis. The network infrastructure continued to be operated in a fixed-line network. This was made possible using a metal wire or a fiber optic cable. As the name suggests, the landline or fixed-line network’s chief drawback is its immobility. Only the people with access to a fixed-line network could use it as the fixed-line networks were limited. Moreover, phone calls and Internet users could not be carried out simultaneously. Hence, not much development could be realized due to the drawbacks. Despite eSwatini’s struggle with its economy, some remarkable developments are taking place that is relevant to the telecommunications sector. From April 2018, SIM card registration has been obligatory for all users, facing a penalty of deactivation if they fail to do so. This is a sign of progress as well as a necessary security concern. In addition, to augment local and regional interconnectivity, there has been tremendous support to develop IXPs (which stands for Internet Exchange Points). The objective is to “keep local traffic local” and 80% exchange of Internet traffic within Africa by 2020 (Internet Society, 2018). The Internet Society (2014) implemented and supported the African Union’s African Internet Exchange System (AXIS) program.
DataNet: Organizational overview
With the vision to “develop highly innovative technology and service solutions for governments, businesses, and ser -
vice providers,” DataNet began its operations in 2006. The long journey of DataNet started as DataNet in eSwatini. With a combination of business expertise and modern tech-nology, clients receive complete solutions. Services that the company offers include business analysis, software design and development, hardware, communication solutions, to name a few. Moreover, the company buys hardware, deploy-ment, training, technical, helpdesk support, data entry, and customer service. There is also the option of customization where a wide range of activities can be provided in a simple DataNet’s values that include innovation, teamwork, hon-esty, hard work, and its strong management team is a testa-ment to that. To name only a few of the company’s brains, we can start with Moshtaq Ahmed, who is the chief execu-tive officer (CEO), has over a decade’s expertise in enter -
prise architecture, large-scale system design and development, including many e-government systems in Asia and Africa. He was single-handedly responsible for the fourfold increment in eSwatini’s government revenue with his knowledgeable advice related to the tax system. He developed and implemented customs and border control systems, health systems, payment processing systems, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, and systems based on the Internet of Things (IoT).

chief marketing officer who supervises the Marketing, 
Sales, and Customer Care and works closely with the Technical team for developing innovative solutions. He is an enthusiastic public speaker about technology, telecom, and writes about technology. Noushina Tasnim is the Human Resource Director and is heading the Human Resource and Finance department for DataNet (eSwatini) for more than 8 years. These are merely three examples of the many indi-
viduals who make up the strong management team. Their objectives include continuous innovation through invest-ment in research, development, and people, gaining a deeper understanding of our customers and their business pro-cesses, and delivering thoughtfully crafted solutions that combine people, service, and technology. Their success is reflected in the widespread expansion of their products and services to six countries on three continents. DataNet is incorporated as a proprietary business in eSwatini, and the CEO owns 100% of the share. The organizational structure is quite simple and flat, with two-way communication resulting in faster decision-making. Along with the head-quarters in eSwatini, DataNet also has remote offices in Bangladesh to provide technical support. Figure 1 depicts the organogram of DataNet.
Technologies by DataNet
Companies working in ICT industry build their compe-tency by specializing in a few trending technologies. Companies in the ICT industry disrupt and replenish their own technology by bringing in newer, more improved tech-nology to lead the market.
IoT
DataNet has expertise over a few trending technologies;  
to be more specific, they are working on the IoT, high-performance computing, machine learning, and big data. It is a system of interconnected computing devices, mechani-cal and digital machines, objects, animals, or people pro-vided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. DataNet believes that the following components influence IoT: Sensors and 
Actuators facilitate the IoT process; the former adheres to the sensory system, and the latter executes actions on col-lected data, respectively. DataNet is presently working with more than 100 sensors in 36 categories. These sensors can measure principally all types of environment variables that display an accurate reading of practically anything. Due to the precise reading capacity, the company is healthy to negotiate with its actuators.
Gateways connect the various types of sensors and actua-
tors. The company has primary gateways (iG100E and iG100P) for home and small businesses and large, high capac-ity gateway (iG500) for large businesses. Their iG100 prod-uct and the on-chip MQTT server stream data to the cloud (AWS) where it is possible to host one’s own IoT event pro-cessing and decision support system. iG200 offers onboard FPGA and multi-core CPU for data aggregation from many sensors that help send a data stream to one Internet hosted server in Gigabit speed. DataNet comes forward with various connectivity options to connect sensors and actuators.
Aggregators are used in large industries with the sole pur -
pose of linking sensors and actuators. iG1000 is their high-performance computing device with four processing modules where most of the framework is run inside the machine.
High-performance computing
DataNet can make arrangements for a personal supercom-puter that will function on the choice of the client. Machine learning models, an artificial intelligence platform, can run using the company’s platform. In addition, they offer to

have custom-built, high-performance computing solutions 
with petaflops (a unit of computing speed equal to 1000 millionth [10
15] floating-point operations per second) pro-
cessing. A complete data center solution is offered using on-premise high-performance computing. Their iG1000 can process an enormous amount of information inside the device. Clients can carry out advanced video analytics, or IoT infrastructure’s security can be tracked.
Machine learning
This data analysis method converts a process to mostly automatic equipment and ensures logical model building. It falls under a branch of artificial intelligence grounded on the notion that systems can recognize patterns, acquire knowledge from data, and make decisions with very little human involvement. For DataNet, this paves the way for unlimited opportunities, automatic anomaly, predictive maintenance, and sentiment analysis along with fraud detection. With the combination of FPGA and high pro-cessing GPU, DataNet can provide its clients with a deep understanding of their own organization’s historical records or data streams. This aids in assessing and handling their business evaluations. Using natural language processing (NLP) and tensor flow, they have been able to arrange for image processing and video analytics for the past decade.
Big data platform
Big data refers to the vast volume of structured and unstruc-tured data that overwhelm organizations and what they choose to do with them. DataNet possesses its own big data platform, where they are engaged with VMware, NetApp, and Cisco that are put into use to examine in detail the enormous Hadoop datasets. They perform the following functions:
1. Data acquisition. Data streams are collected by sen-sors, gateways, and taps and placed in a single Hadoop cluster.
2. Data ingestion, ETL, and warehousing. Constructive management and warehousing is offered.
3. Hadoop/HDFS. Large storage facility is offered for any type of data where the massively powerful pro-cessing speed aids in managing unlimited tasks.
4. Stream analytics. Real-time stream analytics (as data can be static or in transit) and instant decision-making process is provided to the clients.
5. Data security. Strong encryption is in place to pro-vide exhaustive data security for the clients to feel comfortable to store their data at DataNet.
Project portfolios
DataNet has built its competency in the areas which are capable of providing a solution for the government. The government of eSwatini has awarded few projects to DataNet as recognition of its capability for developing a solution for the government.
Customs automation of eSwatini’ s project named direct 
trader input (DTI) was awarded by the customs and excise department of the government of eSwatini to implement and maintain ASYCUDA++ software for the automation of customs declaration on 1 October 2008. The government of eSwatini called for an open tender to implement ASYCUDA++ project, and Data Network Services eSwatini was awarded the project in 2009 (UNCTD). ASYCUDA++ stood for Automated System for Customs Data and was implemented in eight border posts (Ngwenya, Matsamo, Sandlane, Mananga, Mhlumeni, Lomahasha, Mahamba, and Lavumisa) and Matsapha Inland Container Depot (ICD). This automated system helps the traders declare their imports and exports, and the assessment by the customs department is all done electronically. The traders can declare their taxable goods before reaching the border post through the ASYCUDA++ software installed their computer or declare using the ASYDUA++ service pro-viders at the border gate. ASYCUDA++ has some techni-cal drawbacks (UNCTD) and is replaced by the updated version named ASYCUDA World. The newer version ena-bles the traders and other users to use the system through the web browser, while ASYCUDA++ could be used by installed software only. eSwatini Revenue Authority (SRA) started implementing ASYCUDA World in 2014 and opened the system for use in February 2016. Figure 2 shows how the ASYCUDA World works for customs declaration.
National Fire and Emergency Response System project 
was awarded by the government of eSwatini to automate the service by installing IP telephony, IP video telephony, integration with VHF radio, GPS tracking of the vehicles, and surveillance system. DataNet has done this automation, which is a milestone for the company and the government of eSwatini (Figure 3).
Scholarship Administration System was introduced by 
the government of Swaziland to provide financial aids to its citizen for pursuing higher studies, but the challenge was to retain the talent. DataNet developed the system to track the receiver of the financial aid and administrated the system to ensure the repayment of the loan to resolve the issue of brain drain.
The overpass surveillance system was a project aimed to 
protect overpass inside and near Mbabane’s capital city. High-quality outdoor surveillance cameras are installed in those overpasses to monitor the movement of cars and passersby. If anything suspicious is found, the emergency team can be deployed there to take necessary actions. Anyone staying in an overpass for more than 10–15 min can be identified result-
ing in the panic alarm to be triggered in the control room through those cameras. The video is streamed through high throughput wireless point to point connection to reduce cable dependency and avoid interruptions (Figure 4).
Central Deduction and Administration System (CDAS) 
was a unique software developed by DataNet. This 6 Journal of Information Technology Teaching Cases 00(0)
software works as an interface between the government 
employees and financial institutions of eSwatini. CDAS links the government payroll system with the financial institutions that provide loans to government employees. The financial institutions can check the salary of the gov-ernment employees and how many loans are taken from other financial institutions using this software. CDAS can deduct the monthly installment amount from the govern-ment payroll for the employees who have taken the loan. CDAS aids the financial institution to recover the loan and check how much an employee can borrow from the finan-cial institution (Figure 5).
Products and services
ICT companies usually categories their products and ser -
vices as software and hardware. DataNet has also devel-oped its product portfolio into these two categories. The revenue model is different for both the software and hardware.Software
The software includes selling the right to use the software for a specific period or lifetime. In the case of selling software, DataNet does not handover the source code to the customer, and if any changes are needed in the soft-ware, the customer needs to pay for the programmers’ work hours.
ERP solution
DataNet has a single platform called WorkMation that han-dles all their client’s business happenings, from budgeting to sales, by acquiring, storing, and interpreting data from all activities. It is a full-fledged ERP solution. ERP provided the following functions:

7. Financial reporting. DataNet aids in amalgamating all the financial statements of their client’s organi-zation and provides reports in real-time that is highly accurate, customizable, and shared.
8. Procurement. DataNet said in automating the entire procurement process, thus improving cost control and making it less time-consuming. It helps predict according to past demand, illustrating the chance of error, permitting the clients to have greater control and solidifying their relationship with their suppli-ers, thus being an essential function of strategic planning.
9. Supply chain. DataNet offers customization and provides in-depth system support to its clients. Data such as inventory can be viewed in real-time, prob-lems can be identified and solved quickly, and transparent supply chain management aids in acquiring a competitive advantage for the client. Significant growth can be achieved via automation and the elimination of inefficiencies.
Workforce management—scheduler
DataNet offers Racson’s intelligent scheduler software that produces management reports by analyzing records. Its functions include creating precise and accurate schedules, calculations of ordinary, overtime working hours of each employee, and attendance reports with the help of biomet-ric fingerprint scanners. Benefits include effortless and highly accurate scheduling, an extensive report, and a com-parison of estimated with actual scheduling of overtime.Tillbox
Tillbox has been implemented to measure and manage the complex business activities to demonstrate how the busi-ness is running, whether in a favorable or unfavorable con-dition. It mainly focuses on business accounting intricacies by recording sales, purchases, and expenses to stimulate the client’s business growth. It records sales, purchases, and expenses with an intuitive approach, hiding the complex accounting process out of the way for the client to solely focus on their business. Moreover, it illustrates the client’s company’s up-to-date condition, clarifying the consoli-dated financial statements, and the long-term activities of their business in an easily comprehensible manner. The web interface is user-friendly and can be operated on any device (PC, tablet, and smartphone). Tillbox carries out the following functions:
1. Activity-based accounting. The clients only need to record the cash inflows and outflows concerning the business; it creates all the journal entries and the financial statements.
2. Flexibility. As Tillbox is cloud-enabled, the clients can access it from anywhere, provided that they have access to the Internet.
3. Business visibility. Tillbox informs their clients about their own business—identifying critical points, possible bottlenecks, and areas of success. They provide up-to-date information; concerning profit/loss, arrears of expenses or incomes, and their customizable dashboard is a contributing factor.
4. Scalable. Tillbox is scalable, meaning that it can manage many users, workloads, or transactions without excessive strain displaying the client’s growth.
Encryption and data security
Across the life cycle of sensitive data, DataNet provides a 360 degree solution when it comes to issues of security of 
data and encryption. This empowers their clients to continue being protected, compliant, and in control of their data. Moreover, the clients can access their files anywhere, which will reduce legwork, remotely cutting down travel costs.
Hardware
Hardware is the physical product that can be seen, felt, and touched. DataNet has partnered with renowned vendors of technological products to fulfill their customers’ needs and developed their own devices.8 Journal of Information Technology Teaching Cases 00(0)
Sensors
According to DataNet, sensors are the “front face” of the 
IoT ecosystem. They function as a nerve system and collect data about temperature, moisture level, light intensity, gas presence, distance, humidity, motion, smoke, proximity, and so on. The controller then performs the desired actions based on the data received—like the sound of an alarm, open a gate, turn on the sprinklers, turn on/off the lights, alert the security, and many more. Pulse width modulation (PWM) helps control the flow of voltage to regulate or con-trol a device. In simple words, DataNet paves the way for smart living. Here is a thorough list of what they make available to their clients: home automation, intrusion pre-vention system, fire prevention system, server room moni-toring, agriculture monitoring, vehicle management, industrial automation, environment monitoring system, parking guidance system, time and attendance system and access control system.
Security solutions
DataNet provides solutions appropriate for any network infrastructure size. They deliver confidential connectivity to their clients with their most speedy firewall appliance encompassing the highest speed ports. They offer the fol-lowing security systems:
Video surveillance (recording and analytics) solutions 
offer an intelligent recording of the on-goings of the environ-ment. This includes analytics such as facial recognition, object tracking, license plate recognition, dwell and loiter -
ing, people counting, and queue line analysis. This aids in optimizing business intelligence and customer service from existing videos, facilitates the business decision-making pro-gress, identifies threats using facial surveillance, advanced object tracking, and license plate recognition. DataNet also supports submitting reports of suspicious activity.
Biometric secured access control system offers users an 
appropriate platform to control their properties and ameni-ties. It keeps a record of each entry, also providing the most refined metal detection (to detect weapons) and baggage scanning devices. DataNet has made it user-friendly for cli-ents to access it without any difficulties. Simply put, it helps secure the client’s premises and provides an accessi-ble audit to determine any individual’s location in case of accidents, and makes the client feel at ease about their environment.
Setbacks and challenges
Working in a foreign country is always challenging. DataNet has taken this challenge and successfully moving forward. Still, some challenges contribute to the deterioration of the progress of DataNet. Poor governance in eSwatini appeared to be a significant obstacle to getting new projects from the government and large corporate. The raw material for the ICT Company refers to the skilled workforce. Lack of ICT professionals makes it problematic to fulfill the staffing need in eSwatini. On the other hand, the immigration policy does not permit to source staff from outside. As a result, set-ting up an offshore office is needed to fulfill the shortage of skilled employees. Acquiring projects, to be more specific, software development by the offshore office is rather chal-lenging due to lack of face-to-face interaction and interrup-tion of the Internet traffic. Internet bandwidth is as indispensable like oxygen is to people for ICT companies. However, the price of Internet bandwidth in eSwatini is higher than that of the neighboring countries. As a result, ICT companies in eSwatini are facing uneven competition from other companies from the neighboring countries who can offer a more competitive price. ICT companies need the Internet to offer innovative services just as their customer needs access to high-speed Internet to access those services. A low Internet penetration rate in eSwatini has decreased the possibility of developing a solution for consumers. The cur -
rency of eSwatini is continuously devaluating, resulting in complications for importing devices and setting up the price. As the ICT company cannot store the services they provide, unstable currency affects the pricing. Due to frequent adjust-ments in the price and service fee, the companies face con-tinuous customer pressure.
Moving ahead
DataNet is quite successful in setting up its footprint at eSwatini. Currently, DataNet is expanding its operation to other countries. To support the growth of the company, a skilled workforce is crucial. They have offshore offices to support their growing need for programmers. However, in the long run, they need to develop skilled employees in eSwatini. Besides the skilled employees, the support of the government and regulatory bodies is essential for sustaina-ble growth. To compete with the neighboring countries, ICT companies in eSwatini needs higher speed Internet at a reasonable price. Organizations like DataNet flourish as an organization, but their contribution positively impacts nations’ economic growth.

Note
1. Kingdom of eSwatini (referred as eSwatini) is located in 
Southern Africa, wedged between Mozambique and South Africa and comprises of about 110 miles. It was previ-
ously called Swaziland and its name was derived from a 
later King named Mswati II. The dominion was under the autonomous rule by the British in the late 19th century and finally achieved independence in 1968. Based on United 
Nations estimates, it has a population of 1,399,760 which is 
0.02% of the total world population, the median age being 20.6 years. The country is characterized with a weak, dete-
riorating economy; outrageously high unemployment, rapid population growth, and an uneven distribution of resources 
all combine to worsen already persistent poverty and food 
insecurity, especially in rural areas. In 2016 and 2017 alone, 39.7% of the population projected to be living below the international ISD1.90 poverty line (World Bank, 2018). One 
particular dimension that eSwatini has been advancing is the 
communications sector.
