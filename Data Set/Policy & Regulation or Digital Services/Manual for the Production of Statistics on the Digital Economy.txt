PREFACE
Producing statistics on the digital economy and society is an increasingly important component 
of the work programme of national statistical organizations. The demand for such statistics continuously increases as more countries seek to design, monitor and review national policies and 
strategies to take advantage of information and communications technologies (ICTs). Business 
communities also require information about access to, and use of, ICTs by various consumer groups, as well as information about the impact of ICTs. This is a particular challenge for developing countries, many of which are still at an early stage in their statistical work on measuring various aspects of an increasingly digital economy and society. At the international level, comparable ICT 
indicators are critical for allowing for cross-country comparisons, monitoring of the digital divide 
and for establishing policy-relevant benchmarks. 
The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) is a founding member of the 
Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development, which is an international, multi-stakeholder initiative 
to improve the availability and quality of ICT data and indicators. One of its key achievements is the development of a core list of ICT indicators for the production of internationally comparable statistics. This list was first endorsed by the United Nations Statistical Commission at its 38th session in March 2007 and has since been updated regularly. The Commission encouraged 
countries to use that list in their data collection programmes; a first version of the Manual for 
the Production of Statistics on the Information Economy was published at the end of 2007. An updated version was published in 2009. 
The current edition, entitled Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy, was 
prepared to reflect the many changes that have taken place in the past decade in terms of access and use of ICTs. Compared to earlier versions, it expands the coverage of the measurement of e-commerce, trade in ICT services and trade in ICT-enabled (or digitally delivered) services. Itcontains more model questionnaires and reflects the most recent revisions of the Partnership’s list of 
core ICT indicators. The Manual is intended to guide statisticians from developing countries through 
all the steps involved in the production and dissemination of statistics related to e-commerce andthe digital economy.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The first version of the Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Information Economy (2007) 
was prepared by a team consisting of UNCTAD staff members Susan Teltscher (team leader), 
Scarlett Fondeur Gil, Muriel Guigue, and Sonia Boffa, under the overall supervision of Geneviève 
Feraud. The main author of the Manual was José Luis Cervera Ferri and substantive editing was 
provided by Sheridan Roberts, both consultants to UNCTAD.
The second edition of the Manual (2009) was prepared by Susan Teltscher and Torbjörn Fredriksson 
(team leaders), Scarlett Fondeur Gil, Sonia Boffa and Rémi Lang, under the overall supervision of 
Mongi Hamdi. José Luis Cervera Ferri drafted most of the modifications.
The current edition, entitled Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy, reflects 
the changes that have taken place in the past decade in terms of access and use of ICTs. The 
revised Manual was prepared by a team comprising Torbjörn Fredriksson, Scarlett Fondeur Gil and 
Thomas van Giffen, with José Luis Cervera-Ferri and José Vila as lead consultants.
This revision benefited from detailed discussions during the first meeting of the UNCTAD Working 
Group on Measuring E-commerce and the Digital Economy in December 2019, and from 
subsequent feedback and inputs received from member States and international organizations. 
The overall layout, graphics and desktop publishing were done by Keel Chan. Magali Studer 
designed the cover and the text was edited by Nancy Biersteker.

PART A. INTRODUCTION
Chapter 1 – Objectives and overview of the Manual
1.  The Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy  has been prepared for 
the benefit of statistical agencies, in particular in developing and transition economies.1 The 
Manual  is an update of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) 
Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Information Economy 2009,  enlarging its 
thematic contents, adapting the new statistical standards approved since 2009, and including 
new model questionnaires. 
2. It is directed towards those responsible for producing official statistics on the digital economy, 
particularly in national statistical offices (NSOs). The main aim of the Manual is to support the 
production of digital economy statistics that are internationally comparable – more specifically, 
statistics on the information and communications technologies (ICT) sector, trade of ICT 
goods and services (including of ICT-enabled services) and use of ICT by businesses. The 
Manual  does not cover household statistics.2 The Manual has been prepared by UNCTAD 
and reflects its mandate to assist developing economies in measuring and monitoring 
e-commerce and the digital economy.
3. The Manual  is intended to be a practical tool for producing digital economy statistics at the 
national level; in turn, these serve as key inputs to countries’ national ICT and digital economy 
policies and strategies. The Manual explains the international standards that guide work in 
this area and offers advice on collecting, processing and disseminating digital economy 
statistics and associated metadata.
4. Statistical systems in developing economies are diverse and reflect, among other things, a 
country’s wealth, culture, as well as legal and political frameworks. Understandably, the level 
of statistical capacity is unequal with respect to adherence to internationally recommended 
standards and methods, data collection systems and collection frequency, as well as the 
availability of key social and economic indicators. The Manual  takes the differing practices and 
capabilities of NSOs into account and highlights specific challenges that some developing 
economies face in their production of ICT statistics. Its contents are based largely on the 
work of the members of the Partnership  on Measuring ICT for Development.3 
5. In 2005, the Partnership  on Measuring ICT for Development developed a core list of ICT 
indicators, which was endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission (UNSC) at its 2007 meeting. 
Progress on the development of ICT statistics and indicators has been presented to the 
Commission every two years since then.4 The Commission encouraged countries to use the 
list as a basis for their ICT measurement activity. The Manual presents the Partnership core 
indicators on ICT use by business and the ICT sector, and provides associated definitions, 
classifications, methodologies and model questions.
6. In addition to international standards, the Manual  addresses statistical issues that are of 
particular interest to developing economies and provides relevant methodological advice, 
for instance, on the construction of business frames, data collection methods and use of 
1 Henceforth referred to as “developing economies”.

existing surveys where resources are insufficient for carrying out stand-alone ICT surveys. In 
addition to the technical aspects of digital economy statistics, the Manual  reviews important 
institutional features of the statistical process, such as collaboration with data providers and 
cooperation with data users and producers.
7. The Manual is organized as follows:
• Part A (this one) introduces the Manual and describes the background to the measurement 
of the digital economy (Chapters 1 and 2).
• Part B covers the methodological and practical aspects of the production of ICT statistics 
on the digital economy, including: 
 –Digital economy measurement concepts (Chapter 3);
 –Core indicators and associated statistical standards (Chapter 4);
 –Data sources for digital economy statistics (Chapter 5);
 –Model questions and questionnaires (Chapter 6);
 –Methodological issues relating to data collection, survey design and processing 
(Chapter 7); and
 –The dissemination of data and metadata (Chapter 8).
• Part C deals with institutional issues such as coordination between actors in the national 
statistical system, the work of international organizations and capacity-building (Chapter 9).
8. The Manual  is supported by 10 Annexes that provide further technical advice and useful 
references.
9. The material presented in this Manual  also serves as the basis for UNCTAD capacity-building 
on measuring the digital economy. A training course, which is based on the UNCTAD 
TrainForTrade  methodology, is broadly organized around modules following the content of 
the Manual .5
10. ICT play an increasingly important role in the economic and social development of 
countries, and governments formulate policies on ICT for development in order to seize the 
opportunities offered by these technologies. ICT statistics are essential to plan, monitor and 
evaluate these policies. This is a new area of measurement for many developing countries, 
as is the development of the necessary statistical standards and collection methodologies. 
Rapid technological change requires that new indicators be introduced, and old ones 
discarded more frequently than in other areas of statistics. The UNCTAD secretariat intends 
to periodically update and revise this Manual , with the objective of keeping member States 
informed of the most recent developments on the subject matter.
11. The Manual  complements UNCTAD work on collecting data, conducting research, and 
discussing methodological aspects of digital economy statistics through its Working Group 
on Measuring E-commerce and the Digital Economy.6
5 Countries interested in such a course should contact the UNCTAD secretariat at ict4d@unctad.org.

 PART A. INTRODUCTION
Chapter 2 – Background
2.1 - ICT indicators for policymaking
12. The potential for ICT to increase economic growth and reduce poverty is receiving increasing
attention from Governments and the international community. Designing and implementingICT policies and strategies require proper knowledge of the state of ICT in a country and itsuse by organizations (government as well as business) and individuals (often the main barriersto such use). Consequently, calls for better ICT statistics have become more frequent, bothat the national and the international level (see Box 1). Furthermore, the measurement of ICTaccess, use and impact enables assessment and monitoring of the digital divide within acountry and between countries.

https://www.undocs.org/E/2008/31(SUPP)Box 1  The mandate of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS)
The measurement of ICT has been an important part of international debates on ICT for 
development. While ICT can present opportunities for economic and social development for developing economies, the digital divide between developed and developing economies also presents new challenges. ICT has a growing role in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In its overall review of the implementation of the outcomes of the WSIS, the General Assembly of the United Nations committed to harnessing the potential of ICT to achieve the 2030 Agenda, noting that such technologies could accelerate progress in achieving all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The digitalization of economic activities and trade is of direct relevance to several of the Goals. While none of the goals is specifically about ICTs, several targets refer to digital technology. For example, SDG 9 on industrialization, innovation and infrastructure recognizes the importance of ICT and establishes Target 9.c, to “significantly increase access to information and communications technology and strive to provide universal and affordable access to the Internet in least developed countries by 2020.”
Measuring ICT for development was a principal concern of the WSIS when it was held in Geneva 
in 2003 and Tunis in 2005. The Geneva Summit highlighted the importance of benchmarking and measuring progress towards the information society through internationally comparable statistical indicators. The Tunis Summit recognized that the development of ICT indicators is important for measuring the digital divide and called upon countries and international organizations to allocate appropriate resources for the provision of ICT statistics, as well as to develop effective measurement methodologies including basic ICT indicators and an analysis of the state of the information society. Member States called for periodic evaluation, using an agreed methodology, such as described in paragraphs 113–120 of the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society.
7
In 2008, the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) recommended the creation of benchmarks and indicators, including impact indicators, for further consideration and decision by the UN Statistical Commission, in order to track progress towards the attainment of the specific goals and targets set out in the outcome documents of the WSIS.
8UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 202016
13. Since 2005, several countries have made efforts to collect data on ICT in their economies and
societies. As a result, they are now in a better position to assess the impact of ICT on theireconomies; benchmark their economies and social situation against those of other countries;
identify the type of qualified people needed to advance their country’s information economy;
and calculate the investment needed to provide businesses with access to different ICTs.In short, ICT statistics have helped policymakers and businesspeople to make informeddecisions about public policy measures and private investment in ICT.
14. The evolving digital economy also raises new policy issues. Governments need to consider the implications of digitalization for policies related to areas such as the labour market (includingpotential job creation and destruction), education and skills development, innovation, sectoral
development, competition, consumer protection, taxation, trade, environmental protection
and energy efficiency, as well as regulation related to security, privacy and data protection.
15. Among developed economies, the NSOs of the countries in the Organisation for EconomicCo-operation and Development (OECD) and the European Union have been producingstatistics on the ICT sector and use of ICT by businesses in a reasonably harmonized way,
and a comparable set of such statistics is available for most of these countries.
9 However, in
developing economies data on many aspects of the digital economy are non-existent. This
lack of data makes it difficult for policymakers to formulate and implement evidence-based
policies and hampers the ability of countries to take advantage of opportunities offered by the
digital economy. Governments, civil society and the business sector explicitly recognize theurgent need for such information nonetheless.
16. Many developing economies are preparing ICT-related policies, e-commerce and digitaltransformation strategies without access to relevant statistical evidence. As observed by theArgentine Group of Twenty (G20) Presidency in its Toolkit for Measuring the Digital Economy:
“Even if we only consider existing measurement efforts, there is ample room for improvement,
as data are far from being comprehensive, country coverage is limited, timeliness is often anissue, and differences in data collection methodologies and approaches across countriespersist”.
10 The lack of data is particularly stark in least developed countries.
17. In many cases, developing economies need to increase their awareness about measurementefforts of other countries and may require assistance to incorporate ICT topics into theirstatistical programmes. With the increasing use of ICT by governments, businesses and
households, it is essential to start measuring ICT now, for at least two reasons. First, the
development and growth of the digital economy is irreversible – organizations and individualsall over the world are increasingly demanding and using ICT. Second, the experience ofcountries that have started to collect digital economy statistics shows that it takes years todesign and implement a good national strategy for measuring the digital economy and to
incorporate ICT statistics into national strategies for the development of statistics (NSDS).
Hence, the earlier that countries begin work on measuring access and use of various ICTs,the greater the chances that they will be able to formulate, implement and monitor relevant
policies adopted to harness new technologies.

Analysis in the Digital Economy (WPMADE). See https://oecdgroups.oecd.org/Bodies/ShowBodyView. aspx?

 PART A. INTRODUCTION
2.2 - UNCTAD work on measuring e-commerce and the digital economy
18. With the aim of improving the ability of developing economies to formulate policies that
will enable them to seize the benefits of ICT, UNCTAD collects and publishes data on ICTuse by businesses and on the state of the ICT sector. It also provides technical assistance,
undertakes research and analysis, and provides an intergovernmental forum to discuss
current and emerging issues related to e-commerce and the digital economy (see Figure 1).
19. Since 2004, UNCTAD has been collecting statistics on a core list of indicators related to ICTuse by businesses and to the ICT sector through an annual survey (see Annex 1). Resultsfrom the annual survey are published in the UNCTAD statistical portal (UNCTADstat)
11 and
support UNCTAD advisory work such as its eTrade Readiness Assessments, e-commerceand law reform, ICT Policy Reviews and national e-commerce strategies.
12 ICT statistics also
inform the research published through UNCTAD’s flagship Digital Economy Report  and the
related intergovernmental discussions.
20. UNCTAD technical assistance to developing economies on the measurement of e-commerceand the digital economy focuses on:
•Assisting NSOs in undertaking data collection, analysis and dissemination, includingthrough advisory missions;
•Organizing expert meetings and conducting technical workshops for practitionersin developing economies to enable exchanges of experiences and discussions ofmethodological, analytical and dissemination issues; and
•Conducting training courses and developing training material, guidelines and othertechnical documentation on the collection of ICT statistics and the production of indicators.
21. The UNCTAD Intergovernmental Group of Experts (IGE) on E-commerce and the DigitalEconomy aims to build international consensus on issues to do with relevant statistics.Reporting to the IGE, a Working Group on Measuring E-commerce and the Digital Economy
helps improve the availability of relevant statistics, particularly in developing countries. It also
seeks to identify specific measurement opportunities and challenges for developing countries.

2.3 - Work by other institutions on measuring the digital economy
22. UNCTAD’s work on measuring the digital economy also contributes to the international
development of ICT statistics, including through UNCTAD’s role as a founding memberof the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development and in its Steering Committee (see
Box 2). The Partnership is a multi-stakeholder initiative consisting of 14 international andregional organizations involved in ICT measurement, which aims to increase the availabilityand quality of internationally comparable official ICT statistics. It provides an open frameworkfor coordinating ongoing and future activities, and for developing a coherent and structuredapproach to advancing the development of ICT indicators globally. The collaboration between
Partner agencies ensures that there is no duplication of work and that resources are used
efficiently.
13
23. One of the main achievements of the Partnership was the development of a core list of ICT
indicators, with their corresponding definitions and other metadata, in close consultation withother stakeholders, mainly NSOs (see Box 3). The core list, with the revisions and additions
presented in this manual, includes more than 60 indicators, covering ICT infrastructure and
access, ICT access and use by households and businesses, the ICT (producing) sector,trade in ICT goods and services, ICT in education, e-government and electronic waste. Themain purpose of the core list is to help countries produce high quality and internationally
13 For mor e information on the Partnership and its activities see http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/partnership/index.htmlBox 2  The Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development13
In 2008, the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in its resolution E/2008/31 noted the lack of indicators to measure progress made towards achieving the targets of the WSIS and acknowledged the work of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development to develop 
such indicators. The ECOSOC thus recommended that the Partnership consider the creation 
of benchmarks and indicators for further consideration and decision by the UN Statistical Commission, in order to track progress towards the attainment of the goals and targets in the WSIS outcome documents. Since then, the Partnership has harnessed the work of its members and made it available through awareness raising in international and regional fora, as well as 
through capacity-building activities.
Capacity-building: The capacity-building work of the Partnership is undertaken by its members 
independently but coordinated through the Partnership. Activities include the conduct of training 
courses and workshops, as well as the production of technical material (including this Manual). 
Other methodological manuals include those on ICT use by households and individuals (ITU, 
2020), on e-government ( Partnership and UNECA, 2014), on e-waste, and on use of ICT in 
education (UIS, 2009). OECD (2011) and Eurostat (2013) cover broader areas of information society measurement. All capacity-building materials designed for NSOs are available online.
Current members (as of 2020):
International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD), Eurostat, UNCTAD, UNESCO Institute of Statistics (UIS), ILO, four UN 
Regional Commissions (UNECLAC, UNESCWA, UNESCAP , UNECA), the World Bank, UNDESA, UNEP/Secretariat of the Basel Convention, and the United Nations University Institute for Sustainability and Peace (UNU-ISP).19
 PART A. INTRODUCTION
comparable ICT statistics. The indicators have associated statistical standards, including 
concepts, definitions, model questions, classificatory variables, and guidance on scope and 
statistical units. The complete core list can be found in Annex 1.
24. Establishing international benchmarks is necessary for producing comparable sets of 
statistics across countries. The core list of ICT indicators is recommended as the basis for 
the collection of internationally comparable ICT statistics. The development of ICT indicators 
is a continuous process, and the Partnership  will continue to review the list periodically to 
address evolving policy needs.
25. The core list is not mandatory, nor is it intended to be limiting. National ICT policies may require 
larger numbers of (and country-specific) indicators for planning, monitoring and evaluation 
(see Example 1). It is also expected that countries with different levels of development will 
have different priorities to produce indicators.
26. The Partnership  studied the integration of ICT statistics into the monitoring framework of the 
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and issued a thematic list of ICT indicators that 
could be used to track progress in the SDGs and that is complementary to the monitoring 
framework.Box 3 Historical development of the core list of ICT indicators
Following the stocktaking exercise carried out by the Partnership  in 2004, the United Nations 
Regional Commissions hosted several regional statistical workshops on ICT measurement. At 
these workshops, NSOs discussed the status of ICT statistics in their respective regions and 
proposed regional core lists of indicators. The regional lists of indicators were presented for 
information to the United Nations Statistical Commission (UNSC) at its thirty-sixth session (New 
York, March 2005). Based on the regional lists, and feedback received from NSOs, the Partnership  
consolidated a core list of ICT indicators. The list was circulated to all NSOs for further comments 
and suggestions. A final list was discussed, and agreed upon, at the WSIS Thematic Meeting 
on Measuring the Information Society (Geneva, February 2005). The core list was endorsed by 
the UNSC at its thirty-eighth session (New York, March 2007). The core list was subsequently 
revised, including the addition of new indicators on ICT in education, and discussed by countries 
at the Partnership’s Global Event on Measuring the Information Society (Geneva, May 2008). The 
work of the Partnership  has been recognized by the ECOSOC in several resolutions. The UNSC 
validates the statistical development work of the Partnership , thus guaranteeing that standards are 
consistent with those of other areas of official statistics. Every two years, the Partnership reports to 
the UNSC progress in the area of ICT statistics and any revisions to the core list of ICT indicators. 
In 2020, the core list served as the basis for a thematic list to support the monitoring of progress 
towards the 2030 Agenda proposed by the Partnership  and presented at both the WSIS Forum 
and the UNSC. UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 202020
27. Among the members of the Partnership, the ITU is responsible for the measurement of ICT
infrastructure, ICT access and use by households and individuals (including demand-side
e-commerce and ICT skills). In many countries, the economic activity of micro-enterprisesin the informal sector can be partly measured through household surveys. The mainmethodological manuals by ITU are its Telecommunication Indicators Handbook
14 and its
Manual on Measuring ICT Access and Use by Households and Individuals (ITU, 2020).
28. The OECD, another member of the Partnership, has often conducted pioneering work
in harmonized methodological approaches to measuring the digital economy, particularlythrough its Working Party on Measurement and Analysis of the Digital Economy (WPMADE)and its Committee on Statistics and Statistical Policy. Two key contributions by the OECD todigital economy measurement are the OECD Guidelines for Supply-Use Tables for the DigitalEconomy (OECD, 2020b) and the OECD-WTO-IMF Handbook on Measuring Digital Trade(OECD, WTO, IMF 2020), which will help to make the digital transformation visible in economic statistics. In addition, its wide-ranging work aims to understand digital transformation inOECD countries and has a clear link to policy, covering areas such as artificial intelligence(AI), the Internet of Things, digital security and privacy, consumer trust in online environments,skills in the digital age, barriers to trade in digital services, and the future of work.

15 In support of digital economy measurement, the OECD Going Digital Toolkit (https://goingdigital.oecd.org)
presents over 40 key indicators giving an overview of countries’ digital development. The indicators are aligned 
with the OECD Going Digital Policy Framework (OECD, 2020a) which guides the integrated approach to 
policymaking for an inclusive digital future. The OECD report Measuring the Digital Transformation: A Roadmap 
for the Future (OECD, 2019) benchmarked member countries and key partner economies across over 180 
indicators, identified measurement gaps, and developed the medium-term Going Digital measurement 
roadmap.Example 1  Latin America: ICT indicators and data collection
The current Partnership core list of ICT indicators for businesses and the ICT sector covers mostly 
basic access and use of ICT, as well as exports and imports of ICT goods and services. However, many developing countries may wish to measure additional indicators related to other aspects of their digital economies, including the activity of digital platforms for work and e-commerce, the digital financial inclusion of microenterprises and SMEs, or the adoption of cryptocurrencies. For example, the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) is using big data to measure the digital footprint in the region. In Brazil, interest in the impact of COVID-19 led to surveys related to e-commerce, including the online trading of cultural goods and services, and in Costa Rica specific surveys were conducted to measure exports in ICT-enabled services.
Latin America and Caribbean countries also use different types of surveys to measure household 
access to, and individual use of, ICT. These include stand-alone ICT surveys, multipurpose household surveys, life conditions surveys, and labour force surveys. In countries with low statistical capacity, other surveys have been used as vehicles for ICT-related questions, such as Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), Living Standards Surveys (LSS) and Family Budget Surveys. The UN Statistical Division also suggests that ICT access indicators be included in population and housing censuses. Indicators collected through these surveys may provide a complementary picture of the demand side of e-commerce and online services, as well as of ICT use by micro-businesses and entrepreneurs.

 PART A. INTRODUCTION
29. The Statistical Directorate of the European Commission, Eurostat, is also a member of the
Partnership and uses best practice in harmonizing regional statistics. In order to produce
internationally comparable indicators, Eurostat and the European NSOs developed aMethodological Manual for its surveys on ICT usage in enterprises and households,
16  
including model questionnaires (see Annex 5).17 The production of digital economy statistics
by Eurostat is directly linked to supporting and monitoring the implementation of Europe’sdigital strategy, including its aim to build a European digital single market. Eurostat has alsopromoted applied research projects with advanced use of survey data, such as the ESS LAITproject
18 that sought to link data from enterprise surveys (including on the use of ICT) and
econometric models to measure the impact of ICT on business performance.
30. The G20 is an international forum for the governments and central bank governors from 19countries and the European Union, which in 2017 established a Digital Economy Task Force(DETF). The DETF collaborated closely with the OECD, UNCTAD and other internationalorganizations to produce a Toolkit for Measuring the Digital Economy in 2018, whichoutlined a measurement agenda for the digital economy and analyzes the situation in G20countries with reference to 35 indicators. It also highlighted statistical gaps and suggestsactions for improvement.
19 The Toolkit was then expanded and developed into A roadmap
toward a common framework for measuring the Digital Economy published in 2020 (OECD,2020a). The Roadmap has significantly advanced the conceptual work around defining thedigital economy and its components, since agreed definitions are a basis for accurate andcomparable measurement.

17 Based on Eurostat’ s data, the European Commission has a digital scoreboard that measures the performance 
of member States in areas ranging from connectivity and digital skills to the digitization of businesses and public 
services. It also produces the Digital Economy and Society Index and established a Monitoring Framework for the Digital Economy and Society. See https://digital-agenda-data.eu/

PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
Chapter 3 –  Conceptual frameworks for measurement of the 
digital economy
31. This chapter presents the concepts underlying certain aspects of the statistical measurement
of the digital economy, with the objective of providing official statisticians, and others with aninterest in such statistics, with a basic framework for measuring e-commerce and the digital
economy.
3.1 - A conceptual framework for measurement of the digital economy
32. A distinctive characteristic of the digital economy is the intensive use by businesses of ICT
for the collection, storage, processing and transmission of information. Business data fromsome industrialized countries show that improvements in productivity can be explained,
at least partly, by use of ICT, which in turn is supported by supply of goods and services
produced by the ICT sector and through trade. A robust ICT sector can also contribute toaggregate labour productivity growth.
33. The notion of the digital economy has become commonplace to describe how digitaltechnology is changing patterns of production (supply) and consumption (demand). Thedifferent technologies and economic aspects of the digital economy can be broken down
into three broad components (UNCTAD, 2019):
•Core aspects or foundational aspects of the digital economy, which comprise
fundamental innovations (semiconductors, processors), core technologies (computers,telecommunication devices) and enabling infrastructures (Internet and telecoms networks).
•Digital and information technology (IT) sectors, which produce key products or servicesthat rely on core digital technologies, including digital platforms, mobile applications andpayment services. The digital economy is to a high degree affected by innovative services
in these sectors, which are making a growing contribution to economies, as well as
enabling potential spillover effects to other sectors.
•A wider set of digitalizing sectors, which includes those where digital products andservices are being increasingly used (e.g., for e-commerce). Even if change is incremental,many sectors of the economy are being digitalized in this way. This includes digitally
enabled sectors in which new activities or business models have emerged and are being
transformed as a result of digital technologies. Examples include finance, media, tourismand transportation. Moreover, although less often highlighted, digitally literate or skilledworkers, consumers, buyers and users are crucial for the growth of the digitalized economy.
34. Currently, certain aspects of the digital economy can be measured based on the componentsor ‘building blocks’ of supply and demand (see Figure 2). Statistical measurement instruments (surveys and other statistical operations) can cover these ‘blocks’ or conceptual areas.23
 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
35. Statistical operations can separately investigate the supply of and demand for ICT, as well as 
ICT infrastructure and trade.20 
• From the supply side, statistics are collected about the ICT sector; that is, ICT manufacturing 
and services industries that supply ICT infrastructure, goods and services. The output of 
the ICT sector in terms of goods can be classified using the World Customs Organization’s 
(WCO) Harmonized System (HS) and equivalent national classifications.21 ICT services 
are mainly estimated using the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Balance of Payments 
(BOP) classification, which is rather broad and only captures transactions between 
residents and non-residents. The ICT sector is defined in terms of the UN’s International 
Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) and equivalent national 
classifications (see Chapter 4).22 Measurement from the demand side addresses access 
20 Some countries have surveys for the measurement of other topics relating to the information economy, such as 
innovation and R&D in firms (based in the OECD/Eurostat Oslo Manual  and OECD Frascati Manual ), patents, 
and human resources in Science and Technology (OECD Canberra Manual ).
21 The UN’s Central Product Classification has been used for the OECD’s revised ICT goods classification 
(released in 2008).
22 The ICT sector definition was revised by the OECD in 2006 in order to comply with ISIC Rev. 4.Figure 2 Building blocks of the digital economy

focuses on demand side measures of the business sector).
• ICT-enabled services are non-ICT services that are facilitated by ICT. By their nature, they 
can be traded across borders and are an increasingly important part of services trade. 
UNCTAD has proposed a classification of ICT-enabled services, as well as core indicators 
to measure cross-border trade of such services. 
• From the demand side, indicators are collected about the use of ICT by businesses; that 
is, their process of digitalization , defined as the transition of businesses through the use of 
digital technologies, products and services. 
36. In terms of sector, there is not yet a widely agreed definition of the digital economy, but the 
G20 Roadmap recommends a first approach at a definition by distinguishing between three 
levels of measure (see Figure 3):
• Core measure: only economic activities from producers of ICT goods and digital services;
• Narrow measure: the core sector, plus the economic activity from firms that are reliant on 
digital inputs; and
• Broad measure: the first two measures as well as economic activity from firms significantly 
enhanced using digital inputs. These inputs include digital infrastructure, equipment and 
software but can also include data as well as complementary skills.

 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
37. The types of ICT indicators respond to different needs of policymakers and other data users, 
at different stages of ICT development:
• ICT readiness indicators (i.e., on the readiness of a country’s infrastructure, society, 
economy and business sector to undertake ICT-related activities) are of particular interest 
to policymakers in countries at early stages of ICT maturity, but are likely to lose relevance 
or evolve as technologies become more prevalent;
• ICT intensity indicators (i.e., on the use of ICT and the extent to which ICT-related activities 
are carried out by businesses and other institutional actors) are likely to be of interest to 
policymakers in countries where ICT is spreading; and
• Indicators on the outcomes and impacts of ICT on business activities and economic 
growth are likely to be of interest in countries with a relatively high level of ICT development.
38. Priorities for statistical work on ICT should follow users’ needs. As national ICT policies 
move from diagnostic or design to implementation and to evaluation, decision makers will be 
interested in the corresponding phases of the statistical work (see Table 1).
39. As indicated above, statistical programmes (i.e., the implementation of different statistical 
operations over a multi-annual period) should reflect the evolution of information needs and 
are generally expected to extend and improve ICT measurement activities as technologies 
permeate society and the economy.
40. Evaluations of the impact of ICT on an economy may be studied through the compilation 
of ICT satellite accounts. Such an account is a national accounting tool and represents a 
statistical framework for organizing and presenting information about ICT products and ICT-
related activity. It is based on the System of National Accounts (SNA) concepts, definitions 
and methods. Satellite accounts enable the calculation of the direct contribution of ICT to 
the main national accounting aggregates, such as gross fixed capital formation and gross 
domestic product (GDP), and others. Few countries have to-date made use of this approach. 
It integrates statistics related to the supply of ICT products (production, imports), and to the 
23 These phases can be defined more precisely according to the Generic Statistical Business Process Model (see 
Section 5.1).Policymaking stages Phases of statistical work23Main statistical issues

demand and use (intermediate consumption, final use, exports, capital formation, etc.) and 
can be considered as a major milestone in the statistical work on ICT. A prerequisite for the 
preparation of satellite accounts is to establish classifications on industries and products 
used in all ICT-related surveys. It helps also to identify areas where deficiencies may exist in 
the collection of ICT statistics.
41. In developing economies, especially the least developed countries (LDC), ICT infrastructure, 
supply and use may be at a low level. Data on ICT are therefore likely to be scarce and 
measurement programmes will probably need to be prioritized. The internationally agreed 
core list of ICT indicators (see Annex 1) should provide guidance on the choice of priorities, 
while this Manual  will help countries by providing guidance on the collection of relevant 
statistics.
3.2 - Concepts of e-business
42. E-business refers to the use of ICT to facilitate business processes. It is also referred as 
digitalization . Businesses can use ICT to communicate with government organizations, 
suppliers and clients (via email, for example) or to purchase and sell goods and services 
online (e-commerce). ICT can also be used to automate business processes, to manage 
resources and to implement business policies (in marketing, human resources, finance, 
etc.). A diversity of business processes, as well as barriers that hamper their use, can be 
investigated in statistical surveys.
43. For a definition of e-business that could be used for statistical purposes, several broad 
business functions are identified and described in terms of e-business processes (see Table 
2). In 2003, an OECD expert group on the measurement of e-business processes proposed 
a definition of e-business processes as “(automated) business processes (both intra- and 
inter-business) over computed mediated networks”. In addition, the group proposed that 
e-business processes should integrate tasks and extend beyond a stand-alone or individual 
application.
E-business process Description
Customer acquisition and retention Customer relationship management (CRM); marketing campaign 
management, planning and execution; database marketing, direct 
marketing and telemarketing; electronic catalogues; web activity analysis 
and web advertising; other big data analytics; call centres; arranging 
repairs and maintenance; handling customer complaints.
E-commerce Sale or purchase/procurement of goods or services (includes getting 
estimates, negotiating, ordering, arranging contracts); electronic data 
interchange (EDI); mobile commerce; integration of ordering system 
with that of customers/suppliers; integrated invoicing and payment by 
customers; full integration with back-end systems; use of an extranet; 
secure transactions; automated payment of suppliers.
Order fulfilment and order tracking Order control, product control, order tracking; data processing that relates 
to order fulfilment or tracking; sales force automation.
Logistics (inbound and outbound) 
and inventory controlSupply chain management (SCM); production and inventory control 
(including of raw materials, parts, finished goods), distribution control, 
management of inventory, management of customers’ inventory, 
transportation and shipping, automated warehouse; arranging and 
managing transport, dispatch of goods, tracking, provision of services.Table 2 Types of e-business processes27
 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
44. For the purpose of preparing a survey questionnaire, a pragmatic approach to the 
measurement of e-business is to select processes of particular interest for which feasible 
questions (easily responded to with yes/no) could be included in an economy-wide survey. 
The model questionnaires on ICT use by businesses proposed by OECD and Eurostat include 
questions that cover some e-business processes. This approach has also been followed 
in those developing economies that have started to collect ICT data from businesses (see 
Example 2).
45. Analyses of the impact of e-business on business performance and growth have so far been 
supported by statistical evidence consisting of aggregate indicators and business micro-
data from developed countries. Developing economies should consider their requirements 
for further data analysis when planning investigations about e-business and determining 
a particular form of data collection. In particular, the need for linking data on e-business 
from stand-alone ICT surveys with other information on the business’ performance (such as 
information from taxation records and general business surveys) should be considered.
46. Developing economies could also consider the possibility of including a module on e-business 
in current business surveys, thereby enabling the linkage of ICT with economic variables in 
order to analyze the effect of e-business processes on business performance. These options 
are further discussed in Chapter 5.E-business process Description

within the business; content management system; e-learning.UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 202028
3.3 - ICT goods production
47. ICT goods are defined by their function: they must either be intended to fulfil the function of 
information processing and communication by electronic means, including transmission and 
display, or use electronic processing to detect, measure and/or record physical phenomena, 
or to control a physical process. 
48. Based on international classifications of products, ICT goods are classified into the following 
categories: 
• Computers and peripheral equipment, such as printers and monitors.
• Communication equipment, such as telephones and radio transmission devices.
• Consumer electronic equipment, such as sound or video devices.
• Electronic components, such as circuits, valves and tubes, and transistors.  
• Other (miscellaneous) such as semiconductors and lasers.  
49. For statistical purposes, the World Customs Organization’s classification, known as the 
Harmonized System, is used to define ICT goods. More detail is given in Section 4.3, with 
special emphasis on cross-border trade of ICT goods.
50. Based on the ICT goods definition, economic activities can be selected as being part of the 
“ICT manufacturing sector”. Details on the statistical classification is given in Section 4.2. This 
constitutes part of the “core measure” of the digital economy.Example 2 Thailand: ICT Establishment Survey
Since 2004, the National Statistical Ofﬁce of Thailand, which reports to the Ministry of ICT, has 
carried out annual business surveys on the use of ICT, with its latest edition being in 2018. The 
full report is published yearly, and the data are divided in sections that correspond to the different 
dimensions of the business: Section of data by size, Section of data by establishment and so on.
One of the main findings of the first section is that the usage of computers is still not fully extended, 
and it is below 70 per cent in all economic sectors but IT and Private Health, and since these 
two sectors do not have a high enough weight in the economy, the total usage of computers in 
Business as of 2018 is still at 39.8 per cent. While the Use of the Internet is marginally higher at 
40.8 per cent, the same sectorial trend persists.
It is also relevant to talk about the purchases and sales through the Internet. In neither of the 
two cases is the share of business using these services above eight per cent, where only Private 
hospitals have a share above 10 per cent. The same can be said for the use of websites, which 
still is at 16.8 per cent overall.
In terms of the sizes of the companies, while the shares increase with the number of employees, 
it does not so by much once the number of workers is above 50 in terms of sales and purchases 
via Internet. However, the number of employees seems to matter a lot more for the use of a 
website, computers and Internet in general. When more than 11 persons are employed, all these 
shares are above 40% and keep scaling up to 99.8% in the use of computers and almost 80% 
in the use of a website.

 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
3.4 - ICT services production
51. The Partnership adopted the OECD definition of ICT services, which includes all activities
intended to enable and/or fulfil the function of information processing and communication.
52. To facilitate its statistical measurement, the ICT services sector is defined as an aggregation
of the ISIC Rev.4 classes including:
•Software publishing
•Telecommunications
•Computer services (programming, consultancy and related activities)
•Data processing, hosting and related activities
•Repair of computers and communication equipment.
3.5 - Trade in ICT goods and services
53. Global demand for ICT goods and services through international trade and investment candrive the activities of many upstream domestic ICT and non-ICT industries. Trade data,combined with statistical information about the supplying sectors (value added, jobs, input-
output tables) can eventually provide insight into the “extended footprint” of the ICT sector
and place this in a cross-border perspective (OECD, 2020a). Internationally comparablestatistics on foreign trade in ICT goods are therefore crucial to understand the supply anddemand at global and national levels. Details on indicators on trade of goods and services isgiven in Sections 4.3 and 4.4.
3.6 - Digital trade
54. Digital cross-border trade includes import and export of goods and services using ICT. Theinitial measurement effort of the OECD Working Party on Indicators for the Information Society(WPIIS; renamed to Working Party on Measurement and Analysis of the Digital Economy,
WPMADE, in 2014) targeted the trade of goods (including ICT goods) via e-commerce, and
more recent initiatives have considered the statistical definition and measurement of trade inservices, including ICT services and others that can be delivered remotely.
3.6.1 E-commerce
55. Electronic commerce (e-commerce) transactions are at the core of the statistical measurement 
of e-business. The great policy interest in measuring the volume and characteristics of
e-commerce has driven theoretical work in expert groups (such as the OECD’s WPMADE) 
and practice by statistical offices and other institutions.
56. The need for an operational definition of e-commerce, suitable as a basis for items in statistical 
questionnaires, was recognized early by expert groups. In 2000, OECD member countries 
endorsed two definitions of electronic transactions based on narrow and broad definitions of 
the underpinning communications infrastructure. Following challenges with implementing 
the infrastructure-based differentiation in practice, a single consolidated definition was 
endorsed in 2009 (OECD,  2011). According to the OECD definition, it is the method by 
which the order is placed or received, not the payment or channel of delivery, which 
determines whether a transaction is an e-commerce transaction (see Box 4).UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 202030
57. The measurement of electronic transactions presents specific difficulties. Potential data 
collection problems include:
• The small volume of e-commerce activity in the economy, with consequent high standard 
errors and poor reliability of disaggregated data, and
• Poor quality of reported data resulting from a lack of record-keeping, or potentially from 
misunderstanding of statistical concepts related to e-commerce.24
58. To take into account the different levels of technological development in countries, the 
Partnership recommends collecting data only on orders received or placed over the Internet, 
including by email (the latter is excluded from the OECD definition).
59. Some countries have collected data on e-commerce with relevant breakdowns such as  
the nature of products or location of the buyer/seller . The reliability of these splits can be 
questioned (for instance, a business may not know or have recorded the destination of its 
online sales) and therefore such a breakdown is not recommended for countries just starting 
data collection on the use of ICT by businesses.
3.6.2 ICT-enabled services (digitally delivered services)
60. A growing number of countries and industries are embracing the opportunities offered by ICT
to deliver and receive services as exporters or importers. Services trade is evolving from ICTservices (call centers, software coding, generation of digital content, etc.) to more complexbusiness process such as human resource management, payroll, accounting, architecturaldesign, R&D, editing, education and so on. Services that may be delivered remotely via ICTare referred to as ICT-enabled services (ITES).
24 Other statistical difficulties in e-commerce measurement ar e described in OECD, 2005, 2007 and 2011.Box 4  OECD definition of e-commerce transactions and interpretation guidelines
The OECD provides a definition for e-commerce transactions and guidelines for interpretation.  
This definition was intr
oduced in 2009 and addresses the limitations of an earlier approach which 
differentiated between “broad” and “narrow” scopes of e-commerce based on whether the 
transaction was conducted over the Internet or any computer-mediated network.
An e-commerce transaction is the sale or purchase of goods or services, conducted 
over computer networks by methods specifically designed for the purpose of receiving or 
placing of orders. The goods or services are ordered by those methods, but the payment and 
the ultimate delivery of the goods or services do not have to be conducted online. An e-
commerce transaction can be between enterprises, households, individuals, Governments, 
and other public or private organizations.
As a guideline for the interpretation of the definition, the OECD notes that the definition 
includes orders made UISFPVHI web pages, extranet, or electronic data interchange (EDI). 
The definition excludes orders received or placed by telephone, facsimile, or manually typed 
emails.

 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
61. The difficulty of measuring ICT-enabled services is compounded by the increasing complexity 
of technologies (e.g., business platforms) and business models (e.g., increasing trade within 
components and affiliates of multinational enterprises). In 2013, the Partnership  formed a 
Task Group on Measuring Trade in ICT Services and ICT-enabled Services that developed 
recommendations for statistical indicators for these components of services trade.
62. The concept of ITES is less straightforward than ICT services. ITES are defined as those 
services that are delivered remotely over ICT networks (i.e., over voice or data networks, 
including the Internet). ITES include activities that can be specified, performed, delivered, 
evaluated and consumed electronically.
63. Trade in ITES would thus essentially encompass all services transactions delivered remotely 
over ICT networks via cross-border supply. Excluded are those services that involve the 
movement of physical objects or people, such as transport, or those that require face-to-
face contact, such as personal services, even if they make use ICT for purposes other than 
remote delivery. Since a subset of potentially ITES will certainly be delivered remotely over 
ICT networks, the Partnership  recommended focusing measurement efforts on the broader, 
more inclusive complementary grouping of ICT-enabled services (rather than on those which 
are actually traded).
64. For statistical purposes, the ITES concept relates to existing international classifications of 
services such as EBOPS 2010 and CPC Ver. 2.1 and the standard statistical frameworks 
for measuring international trade in services developed in BPM6 and UN (2010). To provide 
a systematic taxonomy for ICT-enabled services, a classification of services is proposed to 
distinguish between those services categories that can potentially be delivered remotely over 
ICT networks and those that cannot (see Table 3). This represents the first systematic and 
detailed attempt to define and classify ICT-enabled services using existing classifications. See 
Chapter 4 for the statistical standards related to measuring ITES.

Chapter 4 –  Statistical standards for selected indicators on the 
digital economy
65. This chapter reflects work carried out by UNCTAD and other international organizations 
(OECD, G20, WTO) in relation to topics regarding the statistical measurement of the digital 
economy since 2009. It describes the main statistical standards covering the calculation of 
the core ICT indicators on: use of ICT by businesses (section 4.1); the ICT sector (4.2); trade 
in ICT goods and services (4.3 and 4.4); trade in ICT-enabled services (4.5) and e-commerce 
(4.6). It also presents metadata associated to the Partnership’s  core ICT indicators, such 
as methods of calculation and definitions of terms. Related information can be found in 
Chapter 6 (model questions and questionnaires for relevant business surveys) and Chapter 
7 (designing business ICT surveys, including questions of scope, coverage, units, sampling, 
and data processing) as well as in Annexes 8 (classification of ICT goods), 9 (classification 
of ICT services) and 10 (classification of ICT-enabled services). The most recent model 
questionnaires of OECD and Eurostat are included in Annexes 4 and 5, respectively.
66. Besides the core list of indicators, other measurement areas are briefly mentioned in the 
chapter regarding the access to and use of ICT by businesses. These include the use of 
mobile phones, investment in ICT, cybersecurity measures and gender issues in the use 
of ICT in businesses. It is likely that these topics will be of interest to countries with high 
penetration of ICT in the business sector, but the scope for including ICT related questions 
in business survey modules (rather than stand-alone surveys, see Chapter 5) is more limited. 
OECD and Eurostat model questionnaires can be adapted for investigating these topics. 
4.1 - Measuring ICT demand (use)
4.1.1 Core indicators on the use of ICT by businesses
67. There are 12 core indicators on the use of ICT by businesses. Two of the core indicators 
(indicators B9 and B12) are breakdowns of another indicator (B3). For each indicator, Table 
4 shows a definition of the main concepts involved, the method of calculation, and model 
questions. Chapter 6 further develops the questionnaire to collect the necessary information 
to compute the indicators based on such model questions. A model questionnaire provided 
in Annex 2 shows a logical sequence for the model questions.
68. For each indicator, a short reference to policy relevance has been included, so that statisticians 
in charge of compiling ICT indicators get familiar with the origin of the information needs. 33

For international comparability, the proportion of businesses receiving orders over the Internet divided by the total 
number of in-scope businesses. Alternatively, output can be presented as the proportion of in-scope businesses 
using the Internet.
Clarifications and methodological issues: 
Orders received include orders received via the Internet whether or not payment was made online. They include 
orders received via websites, specialized Internet marketplaces, extranets, EDI over the Internet and email. 
They also include orders received on behalf of other organizations – and orders received by other organizations 
on behalf of the business. Orders received exclude orders that were cancelled or not completed. In theory, a 
business without access to the Internet could receive Internet orders via agents. Where this is thought to be 
common, countries could alter the scope of the question to those businesses using computer(s).

B12: Proportion of businesses using the Internet by type of activity
Definition of concepts: 
The proportion of businesses using the Internet by type of activity can be calculated as either the proportion of 
in-scope businesses or the proportion of Internet-using businesses that undertook each activity. For international 
comparability, output is most simply presented as the proportion of in-scope businesses undertaking each 
activity, for instance, the proportion of businesses using the Internet for sending or receiving emails. An alternative 
presentation is the proportion of business Internet users undertaking each activity.
Clarifications and methodological issues: 
Internet: as above.
Businesses should be asked about all Internet activities (that is, the question used by countries should specify 
multiple responses). Activities are not necessarily mutually exclusive and hence multiple responses are possible 
since the business may use the Internet for various purposes. Possible country variations to response categories 
are to add or split categories according to country data requirements.
General government organizations are defined consistently with the System of National Accounts (SNA) concept 
of general government, in which “… the principal functions of government are to assume responsibility for the 
provision of goods and services to the community or to individual households and to finance their provision out of 
taxation or other incomes; to redistribute income and wealth by means of transfers; and to engage in non-market 
production.” (General) government organizations include central, state and local government units.

Knowing how enterprises in different sectors and of different size make use of the Internet is important for 
policymaking to assess the extent to which enterprises are taking full advantage of digital technologies, and to 
assess the impact of such use on productivity and growth. This kind of information is also important for assessing 
the effectiveness of policy measures aimed at promoting more advanced Internet use of businesses.UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 202042
69. The core ICT indicators are expressed in terms of proportions obtained as quotients of a 
numerator that refers to the characteristic to be measured and a denominator that refers to 
the reference population. The use of proportions rather than absolute figures allows ready 
comparison of the resulting data across industries, size intervals, countries and any other 
available classificatory variables. Methods for estimating proportions (and their associated 
statistical errors) from a sample are further discussed in Chapter 7 and Annex 6 of this Manual .
70. The denominator of the core indicators on use of ICT by businesses is the population to which 
the indicator refers (e.g., the total number of businesses or the total number of employees). 
The population will be determined by the scope (and coverage) of the survey. Ideally, countries 
should collect indicators with respect to the whole business sector (or at least per the scope 
recommendations associated with the core indicators). However, countries may decide, 
according to their industrial structure, policy needs or resources available, to investigate only 
parts of the business sector (e.g., the manufacturing sector). In any case, the description of 
the scope (and coverage) of the survey is a key item of metadata (see Chapter 7).
71. Some indicators (B7, B8, B9 and B12) may be alternatively presented as proportions of 
the population of businesses that use the Internet (see Box 5). This requires changing the 
denominator to the total number of businesses that use the Internet and users should be 
informed of that difference. For international comparisons, it is simpler to compare results 
when referred to the whole population of businesses.
72. For all indicators, sub-indicators may be calculated by using the classificatory variables 
economic activity (referred to as industry in many countries) and enterprise size (in terms of 
number of employees) as breakdowns. In order to investigate the existence of digital gaps or 
economic differences between businesses located in urban and rural areas, countries could 
also present the results broken down by geographical classification (usually, according to the 
location of a business’ headquarters). This may be difficult where the recommended statistical 
unit – the enterprise – is used because some enterprises consist of several establishments 
in different locations. For more discussion on the selection of statistical units see Chapter 7.
73. The recommended breakdown of indicators on the use of ICT by economic activity, enterprise 
size, and geographical location is further examined in Chapter 7 and discussed in terms 
of dissemination in Chapter 8. When possible, the breakdowns are related to international 
statistical classifications (such as ISIC Rev. 4 for economic activities).
74. For indicator B9 Proportion of businesses using the Internet by type of access , the response 
categories should cover the range of technological options and should enable aggregation 
to total narrowband and total broadband. The interest is usually focused on the bandwidth 
of the connection, that is, the amount of data that can be sent or downloaded measured 
in kilobits per second (Kbit/s). There is a distinction between narrowband and broadband, 
defined as bandwidths below or above 256 Kbit/s respectively25.
25 ITU indicator on broadband by speed segments the speed in the following intervals: 256kbps to 2Mbps, 2Mbps 
to 10Mbps, above 10Mbps (the latter further segmented as 10Mbps to 100Mbps, 100Mpbs to 1Gbps, above 
1Gbps).43

Box 5 Alternative presentations of ICT indicators
The following tables show the alternative ways in which indicator B9 can be calculated and 
presented (for each size category and for the total population). In table A, absolute numbers 
provide a reference to the proportions, in table B, indicator B9 is calculated as a proportion of the 
total business population (i.e., dividing each row in table B by row 1 of table A and expressing the 
result as a percentage), and in table C, indicator B9 is calculated as a proportion of the Internet-
using business population (i.e., dividing each row in table B by row 2 of table A). Table B is the 
preferred presentation of ICT indicators.

75. The adoption of broadband brings significant improvements in terms of enabling the full
capabilities of Internet-based applications and thus measuring the bandwidth is very important. For example, Internet-based telephony can significantly reduce the cost of communications,higher connection speeds can reduce the time required for performing e-business processes,more users can connect simultaneously to the Internet. Different technological options arepresented in Table 5 (including the distinction between narrowband and broadband), but itis expected that countries will collect data at a more detailed level in their questionnaires.The categories chosen by countries should allow aggregation to total narrowband and totalbroadband, as well as fixed and mobile broadband (see Table 5 based on ITU standards
26).
Co-operation with national telecommunications authorities may help statistical offices inpreparing the list of response categories, based on the available technologies at the momentof the survey.

Definition_March2010_for_web_E.docTable 5  Types of connection to the Internet
Narrowband 
(download speed of less than 256 
Kbit/s, in one or both directions)Analog modem (dial-up via standard phone line). The modem converts a digital signal into analog for transmission by traditional (copper) telephone lines. It also converts analogue transmissions back to digital.
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN). ISDN is a telecommunication 
service that turns a traditional (copper) telephone line into a higher speed digital link. ISDN is usually considered to be narrowband.
DSL (Digital subscriber Line) at speeds below 256kbit/s.Other narrowband includes mobile phone and other forms of access. 
Narrowband mobile phone access services include CDMA 1x (Release 0), GPRS, WAP and i-mode. 
Countries should add appropriate categories to questionnaires based on 
services available.
Broadband 
(download speed equal to or 
greater than 256 Kbit/s, in one or both directions)Fixed broadband, which can be segmented as fixed wired broadband and fixed wireless broadband. 
Fixed (wired) broadband Internet connections refer to connections to high-
speed access to the public Internet (a TCP/IP connection), at downstream speeds equal to, or greater than, 256 kbit/s. This can include for example cable modem, DSL, fibre-to-the-home/building and other fixed (wired) broadband subscriptions, as well as technologies such as powerline communications, etc.
It excludes those users of temporary broadband access (e.g., roaming 
between PWLAN hotspots), and those with Internet access via mobile cellular networks. WiMax should be excluded.
It excludes technologies listed under wireless broadband category.Fixed wireless broadband includes satellite, terrestrial fixed wireless and 
terrestrial mobile wireless subscriptions.
Mobile broadband
Mobile broadband access services include Wideband CDMA (W-CDMA), 
known as Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) in Europe; High-speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), complemented by High-Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA); CDMA2000 1xEV-DO and CDMA 2000 1xEV-DV. Access can be via any device (mobile cellular phone, laptop, PDA, etc.).
Includes mobile connections with data speeds of 256 kbit/s or greater and 
which have been used to make an Internet data connection via IP in the previous three months. The connection must allow access to the greater Internet via HTTP . Standard SMS and MMS messaging do not count as an active Internet data connection even if they are delivered via IP .
Countries should add appropriate categories to questionnaires based on 
services available.45
 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
4.1.2 Other ICT demand (use) indicators
76. In addition to collecting information to produce the core ICT indicators, countries may be 
interested in information on other aspects of ICT demand, including: the use of mobile 
phones for business-related activities; current and capital expenditure on ICT; IT security 
measures and experiences; type and value of goods purchased and sold via e-commerce; 
and barriers to ICT.
77. OECD countries have updated in 2015 their model questionnaires (included in Annex 4) with 
a two-tier structure, covering “core” and “complementary” modules for up to 12 thematic 
topics (OECD, 2015). Complementary modules measure topics such as: e-government, 
advanced uses of ICTs (use of open source software, cloud computing, data analytics); ICT 
skills (demand for and employment of ICT skilled workers); ICT expenditure and acquisition;  
use of social media; and effects of ICT adoption. Countries interested in measuring such 
topics in addition to the core ICT indicators proposed by UNCTAD may refer to international 
experiences such as those of the OECD countries.
Use of mobile phones by businesses
78. The diffusion of feature phones and smart mobile phones continues to transform the ICT
landscape with major potential implications for private sector development. First, it is extending 
access to those at the bottom of the economic pyramid, i.e., to micro and small enterprises
(MSEs) and to the self-employed. Second, the expanding range of mobile applications, from
text messaging to financial transactions and social media, is widening the scope for deliveringa multitude of services that are of high relevance to private sector development. The mobilephone has become the most prevalent ICT tool among the poor, among rural inhabitants andamong micro-enterprises in low-income countries. Mobile phones are increasingly used by
enterprises in developing countries for non-voice uses, such as text and picture messaging,
Internet access and mobile money. These new applications are especially relevant for MSMEs, supporting areas such as communications with suppliers and customers, market informationand business networking. This opens opportunities not only to leverage the mobile phone asa business tool, but also a new channel for governments and other organizations to reach
previously unconnected parts of the private sector.
79. Table 6 offers possible indicators on business mobile phone use. Mobile phone use indicators
and model questions will be further developed as users’ needs and mobile services availablebecome clearer. Countries interested in collecting mobile phone indicators may also want to
include questions on the use of fixed telephones in businesses, which would allow comparison 
between the two technologies.UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 202046

 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
Investment in ICT by businesses
80. Investment in ICT by businesses indicates the effort to update operations of the business
sector and can also provide a partial measure of the size of the national ICT market (seeExample 3). In many countries, national policies to foster the use of ICT also provide fiscalbenefits to businesses adopting technologies.
81. As an example of measurement of ICT investment, countries can use the OECD list ofindicators:
1.Purchase of ICT hardware, software or services (per cent of enterprises, by type ofexpenditure);
2.Expenditures on hardware, software or services (values and per cent relevance ofexpenditure by type);
3.Channels used to acquire ICT goods and services (per cent relevance of each channel);and
4.Purchase of selected ICT services (per cent of enterprises and expenditure on each typeof service).
The proposed indicators can be calculated by categories of equipment and services: ICT equipment (divided into Information Technologies and Communications Technologies); software (divided into pre-packaged and custom), and consultancy services. They can also be calculated by channel: (a) purchase, (b) lease, (c) own account, and/or (y) capitalized vs. (z) non-capitalized expenditures, split into lease and other purchases.
Cybersecurity and privacy
82. IT security measures are included in the OECD 2015 model questionnaires (Annex 4) via theinclusion of specific yes/no questions on security and privacy protection measures in place.
83. The OECD model includes a module on security and privacy proposing the followingindicators, which can be adapted by countries interested in this topic.
•Existence of a formal policy to manage ICT security risks (per cent of all enterprises);
•Risks addressed by the ICT security policy of the enterprise (per cent of enterprise, byoccurrence). Risks include ICT failures, external attacks/security breaches;Example 3   Republic of Moldova: Measurement of investment in ICT goods  
and services
The National Bureau of Statistics of the Republic of Moldova oversees data collection for the 
ICT sector in the country through the annual survey “Situation on the computerization and 
Internet connection”. For each economic activit y, consumption and expenditure on information 
technologies is 
disaggregated 
into four categories: Designing and development of informational 
systems; Procurement of electronic and communication equipment including 
computers; Procurement of software products; and Other consumption and expenditures.

• ICT incidents (security breaches) encountered by the enterprise (per cent of enterprises, 
by occurrence). Incidents encountered include loss or disclosure of data or service 
unavailability, graded according to their seriousness;
• Security facilities or procedures in place (per cent of all enterprises). A taxonomy of facilities/
procedures in place may include: Identification and authentication (Strong password, 
Hardware tokens (e.g., smart cards), Biometric methods); Intrusion detection systems 
(e.g., antivirus, antispyware, firewall, etc.); Spam filter/Web filter; Offsite data backup; 
Staff awareness of their obligations on ICT security-related issues (by training, information, 
contractual obligation); Other aspects related to security policy management (Security 
manager, specific resources, regular review and audit plans);
• Collection or storage of personal information on end-customers for analytical purposes 
(per cent of all enterprises);
• Methods of obtaining or collecting personal information on end-customers (per cent of 
enterprises using each method). Methods may include: (a) Social media (e.g., Facebook, 
Twitter), (b) third party (e.g., Marketing firm), (c) directly from customers and loyalty or 
reward programmes;
• Formal policy to manage ICT privacy risks (per cent of all enterprises); and
• Methods of protecting digital personal information (per cent of enterprises collecting 
information). Methods may include: (a) Storing data offline, (b) control to limit access (e.g., 
security clearances, sharing agreements), (c) encryption of data and (d) protection by a 
third party.
ICT use in businesses and gender
84. Gender-disaggregated data may be relevant for policy purposes (see UNCTAD (2014) for 
a discussion). The analysis of gender-disaggregated data could permit an analysis of, for 
example, whether male-dominated enterprises tend to use the Internet more for interacting 
with the government or for making online payments than female-dominated ones. Another 
question could be if, within a given industry, female-dominated enterprises are more likely 
to have a website than male-dominated ones. Whether female-dominated workforces have 
less access to a computer and the Internet and whether they use the Internet in different 
ways could also be examined. Since the ICT sector is a major driver of the economy in many 
countries, and developing countries may seek to promote it in order to foster a more inclusive 
digital economy, the degree of participation of women in this sector is important to document 
in order to determine whether a country is making full use of its human resources potential.
85. Two major gender issues that could be addressed by internationally comparable statistics 
are the use of ICTs by women working in businesses and ICTs in women’s entrepreneurship. 
A distinction needs to be made between “business use indicators” and “entrepreneurship” 
indicators. The first category is aimed at measuring the use of ICTs by the business sector in 
a country. The second category aims at measuring ICT use by entrepreneurs and/or micro 
and small businesses (including in the informal sector). The two related but distinct areas of 
measurement may differ in terms of questions asked and policy issues monitored. Ideally, 
data for the first category of indicators should be collected through enterprise surveys. Data 
for the second category would need to be collected through surveys of business owners or 
entrepreneurs.
86. At present, there are no gender-disaggregated indicators among the 12 core indicators on ICT 
use in business. The basic question to be addressed is whether there are gender differentials 
in the way companies with male and female-dominant workforces, respectively, use ICTs. 
Possible data sources (ICT surveys and business registers) can be improved by breaking 51
 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
down questions on the use of ICT by employees or by gender of owner (especially in the case 
of small-business owners/managers where property or management can be easily defined).
87. Indicators of potential interest include:
• Proportion of small-business owners using the Internet, by gender of owner;
• Proportion of small-business owners using mobile phones, by gender of owner;
• Proportion of small-business owners using mobile phones, by type of activity and by 
gender of owner; and
• Proportion of small business owners using the Internet by type of activity and by gender 
of owner.
4.2 - Measuring the ICT sector (supply of ICT goods and services)
88. Central to the ICT statistical system is the measurement of the supply side, that is, the ICT 
sector and its products (goods and services). The production of ICT goods and services 
is providing new opportunities for private firms to start up and grow, create jobs, and spur 
innovation, thereby contributing to overall economic growth. Moreover, greater emphasis 
on digital technologies in the delivery of business, government, health care, education and 
other services is also raising the need for domestic capabilities to provide relevant software 
applications and ICT services.
89. Measuring the ICT sector requires the statistical coverage of economic activities such as 
ICT manufacturing, wholesale trade of ICT goods, telecommunications and computer-related 
services. As for any other economic activity, key statistical information about the ICT sector 
includes indicators on the production of goods and services, labour force and business 
performance (income, value added and productivity measures). This section deals with the 
statistical definition of the ICT sector and the relevant core indicators.
90. General business surveys and censuses of manufacturing or services sectors may partly 
cover the ICT sector, and complementary information can be obtained via the analysis of 
trade in ICT goods (see Section 4.3).UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 202052
4.2.1 Definition of the ICT sector
91. The definition of the ICT sector used in this Manual was established by the OECD originally 
in 1998 and based on ISIC Rev. 3. It has been subsequently revised to reflect the updated 
classifications ISIC Rev. 3.1 and ISIC Rev. 4. Currently, this Manual  recommends adopting 
the OECD 2007 definition of the ICT sector, based on ISIC Rev. 4 (see Box 6).27
92. The principles applied to the definitions of the ICT sector by the OECD were (OECD, 2005):
For manufacturing industries, the products of a candidate industry:
• must be intended to fulfil the function of information processing and communication 
including transmission and display, or
• must use electronic processing to detect, measure and/or record physical phenomena or 
to control a physical process.
27 The United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) recognized the OECD ICT sector definitions (both 2002 and 2007) 
and published them as ‘alternate structures’ of ISIC.The ISIC Rev. 3.1 alternate structure for the ICT sector can 
be found in the previous version of the Manual (UNCTAD, 2009).Box 6 The ICT sector definition based on ISIC Rev. 4

 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
For services industries (also referred to as ICT services), the products of a candidate industry:
• must be intended to enable the function of information processing and communication by 
electronic means.
93. While correspondences have been established between ISIC Rev. 3.1 and ISIC Rev. 4, the 
current definition is not a one-to-one transformation of industry codes. Countries should 
establish a definition of the ICT sector based on their national classification, noting that it 
should be as comparable as possible with the international standard ISIC Rev. 4. Ideally, 
the level of detail for the collection of information about the economic activity of businesses 
should allow classifying them by ISIC Rev. 4 codes.
94. In conjunction with its 2006 review of the ICT sector, the OECD defined a Content and media 
sector. It includes publishing (including music but excluding software); programme activities 
(motion picture, video and television); sound recording; and programming and broadcasting 
activities.
95. The harmonization to international standards should be taken as an opportunity to update 
national classifications and classification fields on business registers (or other registers used 
as population frames for business surveys). The adaptation of international classifications by 
countries can involve the addition of extra detail in selected areas or the collapse of some 
categories if certain breakdowns are deemed not to be relevant. In the latter case, care 
should be taken not to collapse any of the 4-digit categories comprising parts of the ICT 
sector (for instance, ICT manufacturing).
96. To help countries assess the compliance of a national classification with ISIC (or other 
international standards), the UNSD has outlined a series of checks that cover compliance 
with the classification structure and classification principles, comparability of data and use of 
the national classification in the statistical system (UNSD, 2005).
4.2.2 Core indicators on the ICT sector
97. The core list of ICT indicators recommended by the Partnership includes two core indicators 
on the ICT sector: the proportion of total business sector workforce involved in the ICT sector 
and the proportion of total value added (see Table 7).UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 202054
98. In calculating proportions or percentages of employment or value added with respect to the 
total business sector, a definition based on business activities is recommended in preference 
to an institutional definition. The business sector, in this case, is defined as ISIC (Rev. 3.1) 
divisions 10 to 74, excluding 70 (real estate activities28). Some countries may have particular 
interest in including in the scope of their measurement agriculture, fishing and forestry 
28 It is excluded because a significant proportion of its value added consists of imputed rent of owner-occupied 
dwellings.Indicator code and name:
ICT1: Proportion of total business sector workforce involved in the ICT sector
Definition of concepts: 
ICT1 is calculated by dividing the ICT sector workforce by the total business sector workforce (expressed as a 
percentage).
Clarifications and methodological issues: 
ICT workforce (or ICT employment) consists of those persons employed in businesses that are classified as 
belonging to the ICT sector. Total business workforce represents all persons engaged in domestic production in 
the business sector. In a national accounts framework, employment can be measured in terms of headcounts, 
jobs, full-time equivalents (FTE) or hours worked. Currently, total headcounts or jobs are used for most countries.
Model question:
Not applicable.
Disaggregation and classifications: 
By industry (using ISIC Rev.4) at section level (A to U)
Policy relevance: 
Given the trend towards higher levels of digitalization of economies and societies, it becomes increasingly 
important for countries to have a minimum level of capabilities in the ICT goods and services producing sector. It 
is therefore important for policymakers to know how the ICT sector’s share of the total business sector workforce 
is evolving over time. 
Indicator code and name:
ICT2: Value added in the ICT sector (as a percentage of total business sector value added).
Definition of concepts: 
ICT2 is calculated as the estimated value added of the ICT sector divided by total business sector value added 
(expressed as a percentage).
Clarifications and methodological issues: 
Value added for a particular industry represents its contribution to national GDP . It is sometimes referred to as 
GDP by industry and is not directly measured (but is estimated in a national accounts framework). In general, it is 
calculated as the difference between production (gross output) and intermediate inputs (the energy, materials and 
services required to produce final output).
Model question:
Not applicable.
Disaggregation and classifications: 
By industry (using ISIC Rev.4) at section level (A to U)
Policy relevance: 
The ICT sector comprises many different activities that contribute in different ways to economic growth and 
development. It is important for policymakers to know how the ICT sector is contributing to overall value added in 
the economy, and how that share is evolving over time. Table 7  Core indicators for the ICT sector55
 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
activities - which are largely informal in developing countries, as well as community, social 
and personal services. The relevant definition of the business sector should be stated for the international comparability of indicators.
99. The calculation of value added for a sector is done in the framework of a country’s nationalaccounts (the System of National Accounts – SNA93 and its predecessor, SNA68). Valueadded can be calculated at factor costs, at basic prices or at producers’ prices. The numerator and denominator of the indicator should be calculated using the same methodology. Thedifferences between the methods are based on the inclusion of taxes, subsidies on productsand production, trade and transport costs and value added taxes (see Table 8).
100. The calculation of indicators for the ICT sector requires obtaining macroeconomic aggregates(total employment, value added) that are central to the compilation of ICT satellite accounts(supply side). Although no international standards exist for ICT satellite accounts, it is a toolthat is increasingly used by developing economies to be able to focus analysis on economicactivities related to ICT or what can be considered the digital economy (see Example 4 belowand Chapter 3). As of 2019, ten developing economies compiled data on the ICT sectorthrough special ICT satellite accounts or through aggregation of the appropriate ISIC codes.Table 8  Valuation of value added

Example 4   Malaysia: Calculation of ICT satellite account
Malaysia first developed its ICT Satellite Account between 2011-2012. Through this exercise, 
Malaysia was able to calculate that the ICT sector contributed to 18.5 per cent of the national economy in 2018, of which almost a third could be attributed to e-commerce not from the ICT industry, and the rest to the gross value added of the ICT industry. The satellite account also enabled Malaysia to determine the magnitude of employment in the ICT industry. The ICT satellite account provides evidence to support the implementation of the country’s development policy in the form of the Eleventh Malaysia Plan, by analyzing all aspects of supply and use of ICT industries and products. The Malaysia ICT Satellite Account was developed based on the framework of Supply and Use Tables but is supplemented by data from annual surveys of establishments in the services and manufacturing industries.

4.3 - Measuring trade in ICT goods
101. Global demand for ICT goods and services through international trade and investment can 
drive the activities of many upstream domestic ICT and non-ICT industries. Trade data, combined with statistical information about the supplying sectors (value added, jobs, input-
output tables) can eventually provide insight into the “extended footprint” of the ICT sector 
and place this in a cross-border perspective.
29 Internationally comparable statistics on foreign 
trade in ICT goods are therefore crucial to understand the supply and demand at global and national levels.
4.3.1 Definition of ICT goods
102. The ICT goods classification used in the 2009 edition of this Manual was based on the work of the OECD through its Working Party on Indicators for the Information Society (WPIIS). WPIIS developed the classification in accordance with the guiding principle that ICT goods 
“must either be intended to fulfil the function of information processing and communication 
by electronic means, including transmission and display, or use electronic processing to detect, measure and/or record physical phenomena, or to control a physical process”.
103. When the definition was first released in 2003 it was based on a list of 6-digit items according to the World Customs Organization (WCO) Harmonized System (HS) classification, the HS 
1996 and HS 2002 editions. Since then the definition of ICT goods has been revised (2008) 
and the transition from HS 2002 to HS 2007, and later to HS 2012, resulted in breaks in time 
series.
104. In 2018, UNCTAD released a technical note (UNCTAD, 2018) focusing on the transition from HS 2012 to HS 2017, establishing the necessary correspondences between HS codes. The definition of ICT goods has been updated with respect to the previous edition of the Manual 
to reflect the adoption of the new revision of the HS classification and to enable the use of 
data reported under HS 2017 for describing recent trends. UNCTAD requested that the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) establish the exact correspondence between HS 2012 and HS 2017 as regards the current definition of ICT goods. The correspondence table covers the five categories of ICT goods: 
• Electronic components
• Computers and peripheral equipment
• Communication equipment
• Consumer electronic equipment
• Miscellaneous
105. Using this definition, UNCTAD publishes annually trade in ICT goods data in UNCTADStat30.
106. The list based on HS 2017 is available in Annex 8.
107. In 2007-2008, the OECD worked to finalize a classification of Information Economy (including ICT products
31 and Content and media products) based on the UN’s 2007 Central Product 
Classification (CPC) Ver. 2. However, like for the ISIC Rev. 4, it is expected to take some time before most countries are using the CPC Ver. 2. This Manual therefore recommends 
that the 2003 version of the ICT goods classification be used for the next few years. A

 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
correspondence between the goods component of the ICT product definition based in CPC 
and the HS is expected to be prepared shortly, providing countries with a revised classification 
for measuring trade in ICT goods.
4.3.2 Core indicators on the trade in ICT goods
108. The Partnership core ICT indicators on trade are imports and exports of ICT goods expressed 
as a percentage of total imports or exports, as described in Table 9.
Indicator code and name:
ICT3: ICT goods imports as a percentage of total imports
Definition of concepts: 
ICT3 is calculated as the quotient of the value of imports of all ICT goods divided by the total value of imports 
(expressed as a percentage).
Clarifications and methodological issues: 
ICT goods are defined by the OECD’s ICT goods classification in terms of the 2017 HS classification (see Annex 
8). Other concepts are per the UN COMTRADE database e.g., re-exports and reimports are not netted out, and 
data are presented in US dollars (converted by the UN from country currencies).
Model question:
Not applicable (extracted from trade data).
Disaggregation and classifications: 
By product codes.
Policy relevance: 
With increased digitalization of the world economy, the demand for various kinds of ICT goods is growing. For 
policymakers, knowing how imports of ICT goods are evolving is important from the perspective of designing 
trade and tax policies, understanding value chains and promoting a more inclusive digital economy. 
Indicator code and name:
ICT4: ICT goods exports as a percentage of total exports
Definition of concepts: 
ICT4 is calculated as the quotient of the value of exports of all ICT goods divided by the total value of exports 
(expressed as a percentage).
Clarifications and methodological issues: 
ICT goods are defined by the OECD’s ICT goods classification in terms of the 2017 HS classification (see Annex 
8). Other concepts are per the UN COMTRADE database e.g., re-exports and reimports are not netted out, and 
data are presented in US dollars (converted by the UN from country currencies).
Model question:
Not applicable (extracted from trade data).
Disaggregation and classifications: 
By product codes.
Policy relevance: 
With increased digitalization of the world economy, the demand for various kinds of ICT goods is growing. For 
policymakers, knowing how exports of ICT goods are evolving is important from the perspective of designing 
innovation, trade and tax policies, understanding value chains and promoting a more inclusive digital economy. Table 9  Core indicators on trade in ICT goodsUNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 202058
4.3.3 Data collection on the trade in ICT goods
109. The usual data source for indicators ICT3 and ICT4 is foreign trade data, which are usually
compiled by national customs authorities in collaboration with statistical offices. A high levelof harmonization – but with some time lag in the availability of data - has been achieved ininternational statistics on foreign trade, which has allowed the production and maintenance ofharmonized databases such as the UN COMTRADE database.
32 The valuation of imports and
exports in the SNA is generally identical with that in the Balance of Payments methodology, towhich the reader should refer for details on the methods.
110. In order to produce the core indicators on trade in ICT goods, countries should investigatethe availability of suitable classifications of goods by their customs authority and establishcooperative procedures between this institution and the NSO. Countries that use nationalclassifications of goods not compatible with the WCO’s Harmonized System should establishthe necessary correspondence tables (it is, of course, recommended that countries adoptinternational standards in classifications wherever possible).
111. There is a potential in combining trade data with other sources of statistical information.Some countries match customs data with information from the business register (via businessidentifiers). An established relation between these two enables the analysis of the effects ofinternational trade on production, employment and enterprise performance. For instance,trade by size of enterprise broken down by sector of economic activity, by export marketsand by location (e.g., region) would allow analysis of trade effects on employment and valueadded by region of a country. The International Merchandise Trade Statistics: CompilersManual (UN, 2013) provides methodological advice on this topic in its chapter on “Integrationof data from different sources”, which is further discussed in Chapter 5.
4.4 - Measuring trade in ICT services
112. It is widely acknowledged that measuring trade in services (not only those related to theICT) is more difficult than measuring trade in goods. Services are intangible, hard to defineand unlike goods they leave little or no administrative trail when crossing the border. TheUN Statistical Commission adopted the first Manual on Statistics of International Trade inServices (MSITS) as an international standard in 2002, which included the Extended Balanceof Payments Services classification (EBOPS 2002), subsequently revised in 2010 as EBOPS2010.
113. Policy interest in ICT services and ICT-enabled services trade is very high.33 It represents
an increasingly important component of the digital economy and is of strong and growingconcern to policymakers and other stakeholders. It offers considerable developmentopportunities by linking economies into global value chains and enhancing the productivityand competitiveness of ICT-using industries, while also creating anxiety in some importingcountries about job loss. Answering the need for statistical standards in the measurement oftrade in ICT services and in ICT-enabled services, between 2015 and 2016 a Task Group on
Measuring Trade in ICT Services and ICT-enabled Services.  was created under the umbrella
of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development to coordinate efforts.

33 This and the following section are based on the UNCT AD technical notes “International Trade in ICT Services 
and ICT-enabled Services” (TECHNICAL NOTE NO.3 UNEDITED TN/UNCTAD/ICT4D/03 OCTOBER 2015),

 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
114. Activities comprised under ICT services are those “intended to enable and/or fulfill the function 
of information processing and communication” . An initial proposal to create a complementary 
grouping for ICT services using balance of payments statistics disaggregated at the three-digit 
level of the Extended Balance of Payments Services classification (EBOPS) 201034, following 
the methodology developed in the Manual on Statistics of International Trade in Services 
(MSITS 2010) (United Nations, 2012) and the IMF Balance of Payments and International 
Investment Position Manual (BPM6 in its latest version) (IMF, 2009). 
4.4.1 Statistical definition of the grouping “ICT services”
115. The statistical definition of ICT services is now well established. ICT service activities are 
defined as an aggregation of ISIC Rev. 4 codes as a component of the ICT sector (see Section 4.2). The definition was developed by the OECD Working Party on Indicators for the 
Information Society (WPIIS), and subsequently adopted by the Partnership on Measuring ICT 
for Development. In preparing the statistical definition, the ICT services, correspondences between EBOPS 2010, CPC Ver. 2, CPC Ver. 2.1, and ISIC Rev. 4 were used.
116. The list of ISIC Rev. 4, EBOPS 2010 and CPC Ver. 2.1 codes corresponding to the ICT sector are given in Table 10.

 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
4.4.2 Core indicators on trade in ICT services
118. Two new core indicators shown in Table 11 are added: imports and exports of ICT services 
as a share of total services.
Indicator code and name:
ICT5: imports of ICT services as a proportion of total imports of services 
Definition of concepts: 
ICT5 is calculated as the quotient of the value of imports of all ICT services divided by the total value of imports of 
services (expressed as a percentage).
Clarifications and methodological issues: 
ICT services are defined as per Annex 9 and include: 
- Telecommunications services
- Computer services - Computer software
- Computer services - Other computer services
- Licenses to reproduce and/or distribute computer software
Model question:
Not applicable (calculated from BOP data).
Disaggregation and classifications: 
Can be disaggregated by EBOPS 2010 codes or with more detail by ISIC Rev. 4 codes.
Policy relevance: 
With globalization and digitalization of the world economy, new opportunities for accessing ICT services from 
abroad have emerged. This makes it important for policymakers to have information on the extent to which the 
economy relies on imports of ICT services, and from where these services are sourced. 
Indicator code and name:
ICT6: exports of ICT services as a proportion of total exports of services 
Definition of concepts: 
ICT6 is calculated as the quotient of the value of exports of all ICT services divided by the total value of exports of 
services (expressed as a percentage).
Clarifications and methodological issues: 
ICT services are defined as per Annex 9 and include: 
- Telecommunications services

Model question:
Not applicable (calculated from BOP data).
Disaggregation and classifications: 
Can be disaggregated by EBOPS 2010 codes or with more detail by ISIC Rev. 4 codes.
Policy relevance: 
With globalization and digitalization of the world economy, new opportunities for supplying ICT services to foreign 
markets have emerged. This makes it important for policymakers to have information on the extent to which the 
economy is exporting ICT services, and to what destinations.Table 11  Core indicators on trade in ICT servicesUNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 202062
4.5 - Measuring trade in ICT-enabled (digitally delivered) services
119. Information and communications technologies (ICTs) are a key enabling factor for the 
development of services trade, especially thanks to the falling prices for voice and data 
communications that enable companies to segment and relocate work to remote locations, 
including to foreign affiliates. This trend is accompanied by a transformation of the nature of 
the traded services, with an evolution, from basic call centers, simple software coding, and 
generation of digital content to more complex business process such as system design and 
R&D. Producing data on international trade in digitally delivered services (also referred to 
as ICT
-enabled services or ITES) is also of interest for trade in services negotiations, which 
typically differentiate by mode of supply of such services.
120. At the national level, the successful implementation of such a survey therefore benefits from 
the cooperation of, at least, the central bank (usually responsible for Balance of Payment and 
other related statistics) and the NSO. The sectoral ministry or national agency in charge of the
 
development and regulation of e-commerce and services trade should also be involved. For 
the initial phases of the data collection (GSBPM phase “Specify needs” and “Build”) it may be 
important to involve the private sector
, to understand better the information needs as well as 
the concrete modalities of ICT-enabled services that exist in the country.
4.5.1 Mode of delivery
121. ITES are defined as “services products delivered remotely over ICT networks”  (i.e., over voice
or data networks, including the Internet). Trade in ITES would thus essentially encompass all
services transactions delivered remotely over ICT networks.
122. In the terminology of the statistical standard MSITS (UN, 2010),35 ITES are delivered via Mode
1 (cross-border supply). Excluded are those services that involve the movement of physicalobjects or people, such as transport, or those that require face-to-face contact, such aspersonal services, even if they make use of ICT for purposes other than remote delivery (forexample, using an ICT application for making a reservation or for payment).
4.5.2 Statistical definition of the grouping “ICT-enabled services”
123. The UNCTAD technical note defines potential vs. actual ICT-enabled services as follows: “the
proposed classification identifies those services that can potentially be delivered remotely 
over ICT networks and those that cannot". Because correspondences exist between the 
CPC classification (product level) and other international classifications, such as EBOPS, 
and the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) (economic activity level), these 
are used to bring further clarity as to what types of services are potentially ICT-enabled.
35 This terminology is also used in trade agreements such the General Agr eement on Trade in Services (GATS).63
 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
124. The ITES grouping includes services that can be delivered remotely over ICT networks, i.e., 
potentially ICT-enabled services (sometimes also labelled digitally deliverable services). As 
mentioned above, services that cannot be delivered remotely over ICT networks are excluded. 
As for ICT services, the definition has been developed by analyzing the existing classifications 
EBOPS, CPC and ISIC in their latest versions, and their correspondence. Each of the 275 
CPC items from the latest EBOPS 2010-CPC Ver. 2- CPC Ver. 2.1 correspondence table 
were divided into two main types with altogether 21 logical sub-categories as summarized 
in Table 3: 1) Potentially ICT-enabled services  (nine sub-categories); and 2) Non-ICT enabled 
services,  comprising a) Transport and travel services (three sub-categories); and b) On-site or 
personal services (nine sub-categories). The sub-categories within each of these types were 
determined with the aim of creating a concise and intuitively logical taxonomy.36 The nine sub-
categories of services that can potentially be delivered remotely over ICT networks (1.1-1.9) 
comprise the proposed definition of ITES. ISIC Rev. 4 codes are given in Table 12 and more 
detailed in Annex 10. 
4.5.3 Core indicators on trade in ICT-enabled services
125. The indicators in Table 13 have been added to the Partnership core list of ICT indicators: 
imports (ICT7)  and exports (ICT8) of ICT-enabled services as a proportion of total imports 
(exports) of services.  Reporting data disaggregated by the main sub-categories of the 
complementary grouping for ICT-enabled services is recommended in addition to the 
aggregate value.
36 This classification still requires the development of a consolidated set of definitions by sub-category (based on 
the correspondences with EBOPS and CPC).1.1 ICT services - Telecommunications

Indicator code and name:
ICT7: imports of ICT-enabled services as a proportion of total imports of services 
Definition of concepts: 
ICT7 is calculated as the quotient of the value of imports of all ICT-enabled services divided by the total value of 
imports of services (expressed as a percentage).
Clarifications and methodological issues: 
ICT-enabled services are defined as per Annex 10 and include:
ICT services delivered remotely over ICT networks:
 –Telecommunications
 –Computer services (including computer software)
Other potentially ICT-enabled services delivered remotely over ICT networks:
 –Sales and marketing services, not including trade and leasing services
 –Information services
 –Insurance and financial services
 –Management, administration, and back office services
 –Licensing services
 –Education and training services
Model question:
Note: the model questionnaire on export of ICT-enabled services may be modified to collect information about 
imports of services and of ICT-enabled services. Model questions on import have not yet been defined. 
Disaggregation and classifications: 
Can be disaggregated by EBOPS 2010 codes or with more detail by ISIC Rev. 4 codes.
Policy relevance: 
With increased digitalization of the economy, it has become possible to deliver more services remotely over 
ICT networks. Some goods (such as books, records, software and videos) are now possible to download 
directly from the Internet. It is estimated that as much as half of all services trade can now be delivered digitally. 
Policymakers need information on the extent to which services that are imported are delivered digitally or through 
other means. Few countries currently have such information and rather rely on estimates based on balance of 
payments statistics. Better information may be valuable for the design of trade and tax policies, among others.
Indicator code and name:
ICT8: exports of ICT-enabled services as a proportion of total exports of services 
Definition of concepts: 
ICT8 is calculated as the quotient of the value of exports of all ICT-enabled services divided by the total value of 
exports of services (expressed as a percentage).
Clarifications and methodological issues: 
ICT-enabled services are defined as per Annex 10 and include:
ICT services delivered remotely over ICT networks:

Other potentially ICT-enabled services delivered remotely over ICT networks:
 –Sales and marketing services, not including trade and leasing services
 –Information services
 –Insurance and financial services
 –Management, administration, and back office services
 –Licensing services
 –Education and training servicesTable 13  Core indicators on trade in ICT services65
 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
4.5.4 Data collection on trade in ITES  
126. In terms of collecting data on trade in ITES, two methods may be considered. A first 
approach is to measure the value of services delivered via Mode 1 (cross-border supply) following the survey methodology developed in MSITS (UN, 2010) for the list of potentially 
ICT-enabled services. ICT-enabled services can only be supplied across borders (Mode 1) 
without travel by natural persons (Mode 4) or consumers (Mode 2). Most services deemed to be supplied cross-border (Mode 1), without people also crossing borders, are ICT-enabled. In this approach, the compiling agency (central bank and/or statistical office) needs to identify modes of supply in collection and compilation. If only administrative records are used (such as 
ITRS) then these records need to be examined for clues about the mode of supply employed. 
If business surveys are used, then questions can be added to identify modes of supply and, by extension, ITES.
127. Pilot surveys on exports of ICT-enabled services (see Example 5) were implemented to test a draft questionnaire. The recommended questionnaire after piloting is presented in Annex 3. The questionnaire comprises three parts. Part A aims at collecting basic information about 
the enterprise. Part B identifies exports of services that were delivered by the enterprise 
remotely over ICT networks (so-called ICT-enabled services) during the reporting period. Part C allows detailing these ICT-enabled exports by type of service, mode of delivery and partner economy.
128. The collection of data on imports of ICT-enabled services can be carried out in a similar way, adapting the model questionnaire on exports. The selection of the target population should reflect the fact that while exporters of ICT-enabled services are not represented in many 
industries in developing countries, importers can include firms across the entire economy 
(e.g., users of business process outsourcing, travel booking services for business purpose, buyers of software licenses, e-payment platforms). Thus, a sample should likely cover most industries in an economy, with higher data collection costs than for exports. 
129. Alternatively, a specific question can be included in a business survey. This option is further developed when presenting the UNCTAD model questionnaire on trade in ITES. The result of pilot tests suggested however the removal of any references to the concepts of modes 1, 
2, 3 and 4, while keeping the description of the different modes of supply defined as: cross-
border supply, consumption abroad, supply through a commercial presence and supply through the presence of natural persons. 
130. For the collection of data, countries should use as sample frame the statistical business register, or ideally, the balance of payments (BOP) register of services exporting firms if one is available. The BOP register is usually managed by the central bank and includes details Model question:
Refer to model questionnaire on export of ICT-enabled services in Annex 3. 
Disaggregation and classifications: 
Can be disaggregated by EBOPS 2010 codes or with more detail by ISIC Rev. 4 codes.
Policy relevance: 
With increased digitalization of the economy, it has become possible to deliver more services remotely over 
ICT networks. Some goods (such as books, records, software and videos) are now possible to download 
directly from the Internet. It is estimated that as much as half of all services trade can now be delivered digitally. 
Policymakers need information on the extent to which services that are exported are delivered digitally or through 
other means. Better information may be valuable for the design of industrial, innovation, trade and tax policies, 
among others. UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 202066
about the exporting or importing resident enterprises. A BOP register should include not only 
the basic identification variables, such as name, postal address of the company, name of managers, but also key economic variables regarding, in particular, the nature and type of exports and imports performed over the last few years.
4.6 - Measuring the value of e-commerce
131. E-commerce is defined as the sale or purchase/procurement of goods or services (includesgetting estimates, negotiating, ordering, arranging contracts); electronic data interchange(EDI); mobile commerce; integration of ordering system with that of customers/suppliers;integrated invoicing and payment by customers; full integration with back-end systems; useof an extranet; secure transactions; automated payment of suppliers.
132. The core indicators on e-commerce B7 and B8 refer to the receipt or placement of orders.However, the measurement of the value of e-commerce is not part of the definition of B7and B8. Business-to-Business (B2B) e-commerce accounts for the dominant share of globale-commerce and is therefore also likely to be the most important component of cross-bordersales online.
37 However, because data on B2B e-commerce are generally scarce, attention is
also given to consumer-oriented shopping (i.e., Business to Consumer (B2C) and Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) (see Box 7). A topic of particular interest is the measurement of cross-border e-commerce to understand the role of e-commerce in international trade.
38
37 https://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/tn_unctad_ict4d06_en.pdf
38 The measurement of e-commerce from the viewpoint of demand by households and individuals is considered in 
the framework of household surveys (see the ITU Manual on Measuring Access and Use of ICT by Households 
and Individuals).Example 5   Costa Rica and India: Pilot surveys on trade in ICT-enabled services
During 2017, UNCTAD piloted a new model survey questionnaire in three countries: Costa Rica, 
India and Thailand. Results are available for Costa Rica and India for both “digitally deliverable” and digitally delivered services (ICT-enabled services), while in Thailand the survey was implemented in the telecommunications sector only.
Costa Rica has followed up with a second survey for 2017 (Banco Central de Costa Rica, 2019). 
In Costa Rica, digitally deliverable services represented 41 per cent of total exports of services in 2017. Almost all (95 per cent) of the digitally deliverable services were found to have been digitally delivered. Most of these exports were by large foreign-owned enterprises that were providing management, administrative and back office services to the United States. Meanwhile, micro and small enterprises accounted for 7.5 per cent of the total exports of digitally delivered services. The workforce of the companies exporting services via ICT networks comprised 58 per cent men and 42 per cent women.
In India, 70 per cent of the total services exports were digitally deliverable in 2016 (reference 
period was April 2016 to April 2017). In their case, 81 per cent were digitally delivered, while the remainder were being exported via the dispatch of ICT experts from India to the destination market. Thus, 57 per cent of India’s total exports of services were digitally delivered. Computer services were the biggest contributor, representing almost two-thirds of the total amount. For services-exporting SMEs, delivery over ICT networks constituted the predominant mode of supply (more than 99 per cent), while for larger enterprises, many complemented remote ICT delivery with other modes of supply, notably sending experts to provide the services on-site.

 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
133. Countries wishing to further explore the extent of e-commerce can include questions on
the type and value of goods purchased or sold via e-commerce. In order to overcome thedifficulty of recording exact values, questionnaires could include a question on the percentage
of total purchases and/or sales attributable to e-commerce, in intervals (e.g., less than 1 per
cent, 1 per cent to 5 per cent, 6 per cent to 10 per cent, 11 per cent to 25 per cent, morethan 25 per cent). An alternative that enables aggregation of values for the business sector isto include questions asking for the percentage of the value of e-commerce (purchases and/or sales) and the total value of all purchases and/or sales, so that e-commerce values are
obtained, at the business level, by multiplication. The resulting values can then be aggregated
for the business sector.
134. Ideally, enterprise surveys including questions or modules on e-commerce would include theamount of sales broken down by B2B and B2C, as well as distinguishing between domesticand cross-border orders.Box 7  T ypes of e-commerce
•Business-to-business (B2B). B2B accounts for the bulk of the value of e-commerce. It caninvolve online versions of traditional transactions related to goods that are subsequently sold toconsumers via retail outlets. It can also involve the provision of goods and services to support
other businesses, for example because of outsourcing and offshoring. There are various
specialized B2B platforms, typically catering to certain industries or value chains.
•Business-to-consumer (B2C). B2C involves sales by “pure play” e-commerce enterprises toconsumers and by traditional bricks-and-mortar retail or manufacturing firms that add an onlinesales channel. There is a wide range of channels to reach consumers, including social networks,
crowdsourcing platforms, dedicated e-commerce websites, mobile applications and more. The
products sold may be physical goods, as well as digital products and services.
•Consumer-to-consumer (C2C). C2C e-commerce can be seen as a modern version of theclassified advertising section in a newspaper or an auction. It covers online marketplaceplatforms (e.g., eBay or Taobao), and sales within online communities, consumer blogs and
chat rooms.
•Business-to-government (B2G): B2G transactions are similar to B2B, except that the buyer
in this case is a government entity, such as when it makes requests to bid through publice-procurement.

4.6.1 Cross-border e-commerce
135. Unfortunately, most countries that collect data on business e-commerce sales do not include
questions about the share or value of cross-border transactions. This is especially the casefor developing countries. Given that B2B accounts for the bulk of e-commerce worldwideand is likely to have the greatest impact on international trade, enterprise surveys may offerthe greatest potential for improving the availability of more reliable estimates of cross-bordere-commerce. Europe implements surveys on ICT usage and e-commerce that attempt tomeasure the turnover and flow of e-commerce sales (see Example 6).
136. Enterprise surveys should offer the opportunity to compare data on cross-border e-commerce with data on enterprise exports (by all channels). This could be achieved by either includinge-commerce-related questions in surveys on trade by enterprises or by including a questionrelated to trade in existing e-commerce surveys.Example 6  Europe: Measur ement of cross-border e-commerce
Eurostat disseminates every two years data on whether enterprises have carried out sales overseas using the Internet. The data refer to the proportion of enterprises that has conducted such sales (received such orders). The data shows that European enterprises sell mostly via their own website or apps, that online sales are mostly to other enterprises (B2B) and public authorities (B2G), and that online sales are mostly in-country rather than cross-border (to other EU countries).
The Eurostat model questionnaire for the community survey on ICT usage and e-commerce in 
enterprises provides guidance on how to collect such data on “Web sales” (see Annex 5). For example, the 2019 questionnaire included two alternative questions to measure the value of purchases (orders placed via computer networks):
•Please state the value of the turnover resulting from orders received that were placed via awebsite or apps (in monetar
y terms, excluding VAT), in 2018. (National currency)
•If you can’t provide this value, please indicate an estimate of the percentage of the totalturnover resulting from orders received that were placed via a website or apps, in 2018.
T
o measure cross-border e-commerce, the model questionnaire proposed a filter question and 
a follow-up question:
•During 2018, did your enterprise receive orders placed via a website or apps by customerslocated in the following geographic areas? a) Own countr
y, b) Other EU countries, c) Rest of
the world?
•What was the percentage breakdown of the turnover from orders received that were placedvia a website or apps in 2018 by customers located in the following geographic areas?(estimates in percentage of the monetar
y values, excluding VAT) If you cannot provide the
exact percentages an approximation will suffice (Optional) a) Own country, b) Other EUcountries, c) Rest of the world?

 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
137. In order to measure the value of e-commerce, the OECD proposes the following indicators
on cross-border e-commerce:
•E-sales value by platform and type of customer (as per cent of total turnover),
•E-purchases value by platform (as a per cent of total purchases)
where platforms include (a) EDI and (b) web, and customers include end-consumers and other enterprises and government: these two latter categories might need to be joined, where separate data are unavailable. As survey practice showed that respondents find it difficult to report their total e-sales (e-purchases), these figures might be better obtained by summing up components. Also, values can be collected in absolute terms.UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 202070
Chapter 5 – Data sources and data collection methods
138. This chapter describes and compares potential sources of ICT statistics and explores various
data collection methodologies. The major topics covered by the chapter are:
•Presentation of the General Statistic Business Process Model (GSBPM), developed byUNECE as a conceptual framework that could support the countries in managing theirstatistical operations and generating data sources of the Digital Economy.
•Administrative data (such as telecommunications regulatory information and customsdata) and business registers.
•Ongoing economic surveys and censuses that may collect a small amount of ICT use dataand often cover at least some of the ICT sector.
•Stand-alone ICT surveys and substantial ICT modules included in other surveys.
•New data sources and collection methods, such as “big data”, web scraping andbehavioural experiments.
139. Administrative sources and ongoing collections can be useful but are unlikely to satisfypolicymakers’ needs (or deliver all the core ICT indicators). This leaves stand-alone ICTcollections or substantial ICT modules included in ‘host’ survey vehicles as the main sources
of business ICT data (especially for the demand side). The choice of a particular source or
survey vehicle for the collection of business ICT data should take into account internationalpractices and standards, as well as national specificities (such as the functioning of thenational statistical system), the needs of policymakers, and available technical and financialresources.
140. The activities in the Digital Economy produces large amounts of data (big data) that, properlycaptured and analyzed, may become a relevant source for ICT statistics. The use of bigdata is a possible way of improving the timeliness and granularity of ICT statistics, as well
as reducing their production cost by replacing ad-hoc surveys. However, beyond technical
issues coming from the amount of information and its lack of structure, the use of suchbig data presents challenges related to, for example, data capture, data use regulation,availability and representativeness. Realizing the synergies between these new big data andother types of sources (administrative registers, sample surveys or censuses) is a critical point
in the agenda of NSOs of OECD and developing countries.
141. The data collection methodologies presented in this chapter are based on country practices
(in OECD as well as in developing economies) and on best practice recommendations thatare broadly applicable to business statistics. Several data collection methodologies are
described and compared in terms of cost and effectiveness, from a development point of
view. They include face-to-face interviews, personal telephone interviews, questionnairessent by ordinary mail, forms posted on web pages, automatic data collection using webscraping methods and behavioural experiments. Countries’ practices depend very much onthe costs (of interviewers, transport and communication) and the existing infrastructure (call
centres, regional or municipal offices, etc.).71
 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
5.1 - The General Statistical Business Process Model (GSBPM)
142. The Generic Statistical Business Process Model (GSBPM, see Figure 4) proposed by UNECE
is one of the cornerstones of the High-Level Group for the Modernization of Statistics (HLG-MOS)
39. Its first full version was released in 2009 and has since been adopted by statistical
offices and other statistical organizations. It has proven to be useful for laying out anddescribing all the phases to produce statistical information in all domains. The GSBPM isintended to guide the planning of surveys and other statistical operations by systematicallyconsidering all processes and the workflow from initial preparatory steps to dissemination,documentation and archiving. The model includes preparatory activities starting from theidentification of information needs to final activities, such as the dissemination of statisticsand evaluation of specifics parts of the process whenever necessary. Most importantly, itallows creation of a fully detailed strategy to produce such information.
39 UNECE’s work on modernization of official statistics is coordinated by the High-Level Group for the 
Modernization of Official Statistics (HLG-MOS) The HLG-MOS is a group of committed Chief Statisticians 
whose mission is to work together to identify trends, threats, and opportunities in modernizing statistical organizations. HGL-MOS is actively working through four modernization groups, namely Blue-Skies Thinking Network, Supporting Standards Group, Capabilities and Communication Group and Sharing Tools Group.Figure 4  Scheme of the Generic Statistical Business Process Model (GSBPM)

143. The general business processes identified by the GSBPM are:
•Specify needs:  used when new statistics are identified or when feedback from current
statistics requires a review of them. Its activities are related to precise identification of
statistical needs (such as areas of ICT use not covered so far by surveys), preparation ofsolutions for them and proposals of business cases to meet those needs.
•Design: the statistical processes are related to development and design as well asresearch work to define outputs, methodologies and such. It includes all the designelements needed to define or redefine the metrics that the business case asks for. Themetadata and procedures to be used in the following phases are specified at this point.
•Build: the outputs from the “design” processes are assembled and configured in thiscase to create the complete operational environment to run the process. New servicesare also created in response to gaps in the existing catalogue of services sourced fromwithin the organization and externally. These new services are constructed so that theycan be reused when necessary or possible, for example, the dissemination of anonymizedmicrodata from ICT surveys for further use by researchers.
•Collect: gathering all the necessary information and load it to the proper environmentfor further processing. This may include validation of data set formats, but never thetransformation of data, which is done in the process phase.
•Process: processing of input data and preparation of it for analysis. The processing ofthe data enables not only the analysis, but also the dissemination of the data as statisticaloutputs. The activities can be parallel to those carried out in the analysis process and maycommence before the collection phase.
•Analyze: statistical outputs are produced and examined in detail. Statistical content forpublications, reports, etc. is prepared, while ensuring that outputs are adequate beforetheir dissemination. It includes sub-processes and activities that enable statistical analyststo understand the data and the statistics produced.
•Disseminate: manages the release of statistical products to users. Activities are relatedwith assembling and releasing the products via different channels. This can includepresentation of the results of ICT surveys to forums of users.
•Evaluate: in this last process, the purpose is to evaluate specific instances in the statisticalprocess. It can be done at the end or be ongoing during the statistical production process.Once the evaluation of the specific instance is done, a range of qualitative and quantitativeinputs is drawn, as well as the identification and prioritizing of potential improvements.
144. Applying this methodology to the statistical business processes in the field of ICT statistics(and other domains) has several benefits that cannot be overlooked. The first one is thatthe standardization of terminology creates efficiency savings and also makes comparisonsinternationally much easier. Second, its implementation allows the adherence to the standardframework for benchmarking in statistics and hence, it facilitates the use of common toolsand methods that again, result in more efficiency savings. Also, the GSBPM includes toolsto manage the quality of the process much better, making for better and more reliable data.Finally, it provides a clear and easy way to understand information for data producers andusers.73
 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
5.2 - Sources for business ICT data
145. There are various data sources used by countries that compile data on business use of ICT.
They include administrative sources, business registers, questions or modules in host surveyvehicles, stand-alone data collections and big data repositories. International organizations,
such as the UN, also gather and harmonize data from different countries to create publicly
available registers that can be used to compute some Digital Economy indicators.
146. These sources do not have equal potential for producing data on the use of ICT by businesses. The appropriateness of each source is largely determined by the balance between the typeof information sought (reflecting users’ needs) and available resources. Table 14 presents
different sources, the indicators for which they are likely to be most suited, and indications of
their relative cost.
Type of source Indicators that may be collected Indication of costs
Administrative sources Limited number of indicators on the 
availability of basic ICT infrastructure.Not expensive (by-product of administrative activities).
Statistical business registersLimited number of indicators on the availability of basic ICT infrastructure with selected breakdowns (size, sector of enterprises).Medium cost (for establishment and maintenance).
Big data sources Indicators on the use of ICT and e-commerce activities.Big data on the use of ICT and online purchasing are usually owned by telecom operators and online platforms. Although such data can be obtained through strategic agreements with private partners with no cost, additional investment is required to assess the quality, clean, harmonize and integrate Big Data and other sources to cope with potential biases.
Module or questions on ICT embedded in existing sample surveys or censuses (these are often economic surveys, such as those of the manufacturing sector)Indicators on the availability of basic ICT infrastructure with selected breakdowns (size, sector).
Generally limited number of indicators 
on use of ICT.Mainly only marginal costs with respect to the cost of the survey to which it is attached.
Stand-alone ICT survey Indicators on the availability of basic ICT infrastructure with selected breakdowns (size, sector).
Indicators on use of ICT.Indicators on barriers to the use of ICT.Indicators on costs, value of 
investments, etc.High cost for design, data collection (which could include fieldwork) and processing.Table 14   Statistical sour ces for the collection of indicators on the use of ICT by 
businessesUNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 202074
147. It should be noted that official business surveys are routinely carried out in most developing
economies but that total resources for statistical production are often scarce. Even so, it isunlikely that statistics on business ICT use can be produced efficiently outside the national
statistical system, especially to guarantee the production under the international standards
required to achieve international comparability. One-off surveys by unofficial agencies areunlikely to be efficient or sustainable over time. They should therefore be avoided and donororganizations that support the strengthening of statistical systems need to be wary ofdevoting resources to such surveys. A preferred option is to include business ICT use surveys
in national statistical programmes.
5.2.1 Administrative sources
148. In some countries, suppliers of ICT services (such as fixed and mobile telephone, as well
as Internet services) compile information about their clients’ businesses and supply suchinformation to government regulatory bodies. As a by-product of this regulatory activity, it may
be possible to produce at a low-cost statistical information on access
40 to ICT by businesses.
149. However, the indicators that can be produced in this way are likely to be limited in number
and in other ways as well. For instance, they will usually be restricted in scope to legal entitiesthat have contracted ICT services and such entities may not correspond exactly to a business
as defined statistically. Also, unless the necessary information is required for the contracts,
disaggregation by business size or industry is not possible.
150. In many countries, even this source of administrative information will not be available becauseICT service providers do not distinguish business subscribers from household subscribersand so cannot provide data on business access to ICT.
151. In summary, administrative sources will usually be insufficient for collecting data needed toproduce statistics on ICT use by the businesses sector.
5.2.2 Statistical registers
152. Statistical registers - mainly business registers and trade registers - can play a relevant rolewhen seeking to estimate digital economy indicators. Moreover, trade and business registerscan be cross-referenced to produce breakdowns of the foreign trade ICT indictors in terms
of enterprise features, such as size or activity sector.
153. Business registers or directories are a key element of the statistical infrastructure of most
NSOs. Their role is to maintain an updated record of a country’s businesses (usuallyenterprises and their establishments), with information on the location, contact details and
other characteristics such as industry and size. Business registers are used in the statistical
process for the compilation of business demographic data and to generate population framesfor business surveys. Most NSOs regularly update their business registers using administrative sources, such as tax or social security registers, and through their own statistical operations.
154. The main advantages of using a business register as a source to produce statistical indicators(besides its use as a population frame from which to draw samples) are that:
•Indicators can be quickly aggregated (no fieldwork is required); and
•The marginal cost of statistical production is very low.
40 Ther e is usually a distinction drawn between ICT access and ICT use. The former is whether entities have 
access to an ICT, and the latter is whether they use it. For businesses, the distinction is less important than it is 
for households. Surveys of business use of ICT tend to measure only use of ICT, whereas household surveys measure access (by the household) and use (by individuals of that household).75
 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
155. The main disadvantage is that the number of indicators on the use of ICT that can be
produced from statistical business registers is generally limited to basic indicators on thepresence of certain technologies such as telephone (fixed and mobile), computers or the
presence of email or a website (which may be present for contact purposes). Such indicators
will only be feasible, of course, if the business register contains high-quality (complete andupdated) information.
156. Administrative sources that are used to update an NSO’s business register are usually goodfor identifying new businesses but less effective at detecting businesses that disappear fromthe population. The problem of having a high rate of “dormant businesses” (or “dead units”)
is generally more severe for small businesses.
157. In developing economies, the importance of the informal sector41 implies that a big share of
economic activity occurs outside the administrative framework (for example, activities of retail
trade without licensing or tax control). The economic agents involved will usually be excluded
from business registers.
158. Coverage problems, such as those described above, can produce biases in statistical data.
For example, there can be underestimation of the total number of businesses (if there is alarge share of informal activity) or overestimation (if there is a large proportion of dormant
businesses; see Example 7). Many developing economies are faced with both situations.
159. Trade registers are the usual source for computing ICT goods trade indicators ICT3 and
ICT4. Trade registers are elaborated from the aggregation of the information of the CustomsAuthority of the country. In general, trade registers include the total volume and economic value 
of import and export transactions in a given period (usually one year). Traded commodities
are classified according to HS 2012 or 2016.
160. In addition to national trade registers, UN COMTRADE42 can be used to compute some of
the ICT foreign trade indicators. UN COMTRADE is a repository containing over three billion
data points, covering over 170 countries/areas since 1962. Reporting countries provide
41 The coverage of the informal sector is not described in detail in this Manual and statisticians in countries wher e 
the informal sector has a relevant weight in the economy may refer to the OECD Manual “Measuring the Non-
Observed Economy - A Handbook” (https://www.oecd.org/sdd/na/1963116.pdf) . In some countries, informal 
sector is investigated through a combination of household surveys, surveys to small enterprises and to self-
employed persons, which could serve as survey vehicles where questions on ICT access and use can be 
included.
42 Additional information on UN COMTRADE can be obtained in https://comtrade.un.org/Example 7  Cr oatia: Activity ratios as a measure of quality of business registers
The ratio of active to registered ﬁrms provides a measure of the quality of administrative business 
registers and their suitability for use as population frames for statistical surveys. The activity of ﬁrms can be monitored by investigating administrative ﬁles that record compulsory activities, such 
as paying taxes, social security, or pension contributions for employees. According to recent 
statistics, the ratio of active to registered ﬁrms has kept on dropping, and for example, in Croatia the number of active crafts has steadily decreased, yet their share in active trading companies has increased, which suggests that active trading companies are disappearing more and more. This makes the use of the register as a survey frame inefficient as the response rate becomes low 
and the estimates are likely to suffer from non-response bias.

the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) with their annual international trade statistics 
data detailed by commodities/service categories and partner countries. These data are subsequently transformed into the United Nations Statistics Division standard format with consistent coding and valuation using the processing systems. Finally, data are made publicly available on the Internet and can be easily acquired using the data acquisition API
43 provided 
by UN COMTRADE.
161. UN COMTRADE contains data on imports, exports, re-exports and re-imports, specifying annual data for each commodity by trading partner. The information includes the value of the transactions in US dollars, as well as net weight and secondary quantities. Commodities are reported in the current classification and revision (HS 2012 in most cases, as of 2016) and are converted all the way down to the earliest classification SITC revision 1.
162. Services are intangible and leave little or no administrative trail when crossing the border and are not properly recorded in national trade registers or COMTRADE. Indicators on trade of ICT and ICT-enabled services (ICT5 to ICT8) require alternative data sources such as BOP data. Traded services can be classified according to the Extended Balance of Payments Services classification (EBOPS 2010).
163. The establishment of a link between the business register and trade register in a country44 
makes it feasible to classify some ICT trade indicators in terms of enterprises characteristics with no additional costs in data collection. The critical issue to link both registers is the existence of a common identifier between a country trade and business register, making possible to relate the trade information coming from the customs data with the features of the enterprises collected in the business register.
164. Since the statistical units and the classification criteria may differ between the business and the trade registers, proper correspondences need to be established. First, trade registers are recorded based on transactions, which are assigned to a trade operator identified based on the declaring unit. However, the statistical unit of the business register is the enterprise, usually identified based on a legal unit. The linkage of both registers requires then the identification of the potentially multiple trade operators of each enterprise. Second, a correspondence between the HS classification of commodities (as generally used in trade registers) and the ISIC classification (as generally used in business registers) is also required.
165. Countries may be interested in checking the feasibility of trade and business registers data linking. To this end, they are recommended to gather information on the existence and maintenance of a trade register, the correspondence between trade and business registers and the link between the customs declaration and the trade register through a questionnaire to be completed by the main stakeholders.
5.2.3 Big data sources
166. In an increasingly digitized world, digital behavioural footprints generate large amounts of information known as “big data”. Big data are provided by different types of sources, including telecom operators, payment providers, postal operators, satellite companies, online platforms, social networks, and providers of Internet of Things (IoT). The volume, timeliness and heterogeneity of big data is very high compared to the kinds of datasets that have traditionally been used for ICT statistics, opening new opportunities for new measurement methodologies with better timeliness and granularity at a lower cost. However, gathering

 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
and analyzing big data is somewhat complex and requires specific methods, including web 
scraping or data science techniques.
167. Big data sources generated by telecom companies are of special interest for the estimation of the core ICT indicators and measurement of the digital economy in general. Telecom operators generate Call Detail Records (CDRs), documenting the features of telecommunications transactions. CDRs contain the relevant attributes of a call (source number and destination number, GPS localization and duration). Telecommunication companies also register the activity in the network, including for instance Internet usage or mobile money transfers. A special mention should be made of the potential of non-Internet-related mobile network big data. Given the popularity of mobile phones, big data sets obtained from the mobile network seems to have the widest socioeconomic coverage among all data sources in developing countries. For example, mobile phone data can replace large mobility surveys and make it feasible to follow commuting flows supporting labour and migration statistics or trace potential infections such as in the case of COVID-19 in the year 2020.
168. A challenge for the use of big data to measure (aspects of) the digital economy is that they are neither in general nor exhaustive in representing the general population. For this reason, measurements obtained from this type of source may exhibit relevant biases. The integration of big data with information obtained from registers, censuses or representative random-sampling surveys is required to analyze and correct these potential biases. Moreover, big data sets are usually owned by private companies and are a core element of their business model. Since data owners may be reluctant to share such a strategic resource, the establishment of strong private-public partnerships is required to release the potential of big data, as well as a clear regulatory framework regarding the use of such data (see Example 8).
Example 8   Russian Federation: Using online payment companies to measure 
digitally ordered trade transactions
Digitally ordered trade transactions are nearly always settled via specialized online payment companies. In Russia, both international companies such as PayPal, and national IT companies such as QIWI or Yandex operate in this market. Russian law requires such companies to have licenses to work as credit institutions and to notify the Bank of Russia when they begin transferring electronic funds. The online payment companies are required to report detailed information to the Bank of Russia on a regular basis, including on e.g., direction of payment, the counterparty country and the currency of transactions. Due to the large number of small transactions (the average transfer amount is US$ 20), the individual transactions are not categorized by type of goods and services. However, considering the growing importance of digital ordering, a quarterly survey of specialized online payment companies was developed in order to obtain disaggregated information on transactions by major product categories.

5.3 - Modules and stand-alone surveys on the use of ICT by businesses
169. Collecting data from businesses is usually a costly task that must be undertaken to the highest 
technical standards to ensure good quality of collected data (and resulting aggregates). Theeffectiveness and efficiency of a data collection system can be assessed from the viewpoints
of different actors in the statistical system, namely data producers, data providers and data
users:
•Data producers are interested in obtaining high quality data at the lowest cost and in theshortest possible time. Data collection costs include outlays for preparation of collectioninstruments (usually, questionnaires), training interviewers and other staff, and the costs
of collecting and capturing data; beyond the data collection phases, there are additional
costs for data processing and dissemination.
•Data providers (respondents) wish to minimize the burden of data collection in terms oftheir costs and time (for gathering requested data and completing questionnaires, seeExample 9).
•From the data users’ point of view, a data collection system will be satisfactory if it ultimately 
provides relevant and reliable information, in an accessible way and in a timely manner.
170. Respondents’ and users’ needs should always be considered when choosing a survey vehicle and data collection method. Mechanisms for consultation with respondents and users aredescribed in Chapter 9.
171. There are several possible techniques for data collection: face-to-face interviews, mailedquestionnaires, telephone-assisted interviews, computer-assisted interviews, or acombination of these. Country practice depends on the costs (of interviewers, transport and
communication), and the existing infrastructure (call centres, regional or municipal offices,
reliable business register, etc.). Advantages and drawbacks of each method from thedeveloping country perspective, together with quality controls that can be applied to datacollection, are reviewed later in this chapter.
172. The majority of OECD countries, as well as many developing countries, have collected datafrom businesses on the use of ICT through questions included in current business surveys(hereafter referred to as ‘modules on the use of ICT’) or through stand-alone surveys on the
topic. The choice of one or another approach is related to several factors, including policy
needs for information on use of ICT by businesses, and the resources and organization ofthe statistical system.
173. Developing economies may not be able to afford stand-alone surveys on ICT and instead mayprefer to include questions in existing surveys that also include background information suchas on employment and industry. This can be a useful way to estimate statistical parametersExample 9  Kazakhstan: Measur ement of response burden 
The 2017 survey on electronic commerce carried out in the Republic of Kazakhstan routinely recorded the time needed by respondents to ﬁll in a self-administered questionnaire, via a question with closed answers in the form of time intervals: less than 1 hour, 1 to 4 hours, 4 to 8 hours, 8 
to 40 hours, and more than 40 hours. The same intervals are used in other Kazakhstan business 
surveys. This information allows comparison of the difﬁculty of completing the questionnaire on e-commerce with other business surveys.

 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
that may be needed later in the design of stand-alone surveys (as explained in detail in 
Chapter 7).
174. Stand-alone surveys on ICT use are generally necessary for countries that are interestedin investigating more sophisticated ICT applications (such as e-business, e-commerceand IT security measures). The decision to carry out a stand-alone survey should take into
consideration its inclusion in the current national statistical programme (the work programme
of surveys, censuses and other statistical operations implemented by the public authoritiesin a country and usually established by a legal act). This aspect is examined in Part C of thisManual (Institutional issues).
175. The next two sections discuss statistical issues relevant to modules and stand-alone ICTsurveys. Chapter 6 provides further guidance on the design of a module to be embedded inan existing survey by providing model questions to collect the data needed to produce the
core indicators. This option is commonly chosen by developing economies that are starting
to collect ICT data in order to produce the core indicators.
5.3.1 Modules on the use of ICT
176. Many countries regularly carry out statistical surveys with the objective of investigatingindustry sectors of importance to their economy. Surveys on the manufacturing or trade
sectors are two common examples in many developing economies. The maintenance of
comparable statistical time-series is favored using the same or similar questions over several
years. However, the introduction of new questions in the questionnaire enables an NSO to beresponsive to new information needs, and to relate the newly introduced variables to the onesthat are already investigated. Thus, the inclusion of specific modules in existing businesssurveys is a practice followed by many countries in order to study new interest areas, such
as the use of ICT by businesses.
177. The decision to include a module on the use of ICT in an existing survey must consider:
•The information needs that can be satisfied with such a module (variables that can be
included and variables in the survey vehicle that can be used for analyzing ICT data). If thesurvey vehicle records classification variables such as industry and size, it will be possible
to break down ICT indicators by these classificatory variables (see Example 10) and
•The methodology of the candidate survey vehicle in terms of population scope and
coverage, periodicity, sample design, sample size and distribution. Data collected via themodule will reflect the statistical characteristics of the survey vehicle (population frame
used, sampling method, factors to weight the observations, collection and processing
methods, level of detail for economic activities, etc.). This may be a significant disadvantage if, for instance, the scope of the survey vehicle is narrower than that recommended for theICT use core indicators, or the sample size is too small, leading to large sampling errors.
Example 10  Thailand: Inclusion of questions on ICT in the Manufacturing Survey 
In Thailand, the inclusion of questions on the use of ICT in the questionnaire of the Manufacturing Survey, has enabled a research programme assessing the impact of ICT on productivity. Specifically, a total of 10 questions on the use of ICT were included in a section on general 
information about the establishment. Econometric models including these ICT variables (such as 
presence of computers and proportion of employees with access to computers) as explanatory variables for productivity measures can be estimated and interpreted in terms of gains in productivity due to the use of ICT (based on Cobb-Douglas-type models).

178. Some countries combine results from multiple surveys to publish ICT data (see Example 11).
Candidate survey vehicles that have been selected in different countries include:
•Economy-wide business surveys: the coverage of all economic sectors allows investigation of the use of ICT in different industries. These surveys are generally carried out to monitorthe productive sector and have secondary uses such as the preparation of input-outputtables and national accounts. Some countries conduct exhaustive economy-wide surveys(censuses) but the frequency is generally low;
•Surveys on the manufacturing or primary sectors:  these are implemented in most countries. 
Some countries further investigate specific activities of relevance to the economy, such askey manufacturing industries or agriculture;
•Surveys on the services sector:  in many developing economies, the services sector is
investigated via a series of service industry surveys. Important industries include wholesaletrade, transport and communications, tourism, and financial services; and
•Innovation surveys and research and development (R&D) surveys:  many countries have
implemented stand-alone innovation or R&D surveys to understand the technologicalbehaviour of businesses. The OECD and Eurostat have developed methodologies(described in the Oslo and Frascati Manuals) and a Manual for developing economies(the Bogotá Manual) has been prepared and is applied principally in Latin Americancountries. These surveys can be well suited to the inclusion of a module on ICT use, sincethe adoption of technology is often associated with innovative processes, especially indeveloping economies.
179. Once an existing business survey has been chosen to serve as a vehicle for an ICT module,the focus should be on the design of the module itself (wording of questions and definitionsto be used). The sample design may boost the sample size in certain sectors and size classesin order to obtain more reliable estimates. It is important to recall that the methodologicalrecommendations for the design of a stand-alone ICT use survey also apply to modules,in particular, those related to the requirement for a quality business register, definitions ofstatistical units and use of relevant industry classifications. However, control over themethodology of the survey vehicle may be limited.
180. Where modules on the use of ICT are implemented by developing economies, they generallyinclude a small number of questions in order to limit the cost and response burden. In termsof size, they generally consist of 10 to 20 ICT-related variables.Example 11 Usage of multiple surveys for ICT data collection 
In the field of ICT, the data collected in Japan is derived from many surveys and published 
under a single chapter in its statistical yearbook. The most important are the “Basic Survey on 
the Information and Communications Industry” and “Communications Usage Trend Survey” 
compiled  by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. Also used are data from 
the “Economic Census for Business Activity” by the Statistical Survey Department, Statistics 
Bureau, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, and the Ministry of Economy, Trade 
and Industry ; the “Census of Manufactures” (see “Mining and Manufacturing”) and “Survey of 
Selected Service Industries” by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry ; statistics posted 
on the website of the Bank of Japan, and the “Telecom Data Book” by the Telecommunications 
Carriers Association.

 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
181. The cost of collecting ICT data via modules is generally marginal to that of the survey vehicle, 
since the most important part of the survey cost is usually related to data collection (including 
fieldwork, where relevant). In addition, staff involved in data collection and processing are 
already trained and will require only complementary training on ICT questions. For countries 
with severe budgetary restrictions, the inclusion of a module should be more cost-efficient 
than the implementation of a stand-alone ICT survey of businesses (though this will depend 
on factors such as the size of the survey vehicle and the complexity of the ICT module).
182. The design of the module itself consists of choosing a limited number of relevant questions 
that can be easily interpreted by respondents. Suggested model questions to collect the 
necessary data to produce the core ICT indicators are provided in Chapter 6. 
5.3.2 Economic censuses
183. Economic censuses are exhaustive surveys of the business sector (or parts of it), with the 
objective of collecting statistical information from all in-scope businesses in a country. In 
some countries, they include also the economic activities carried out by households. They 
are often used to construct population frames for sample surveys.
184. Because of exhaustiveness, economic censuses are expensive to conduct, due to the cost 
of collection (which may require a detailed cartography of the country), and therefore, their 
periodicity is usually very low (5 or 10 years). This may make them inadequate for continuous 
monitoring of fast-growing phenomena such as Internet access.
185. Countries that have used censuses to investigate the use of ICT have included some 
questions on the availability of certain technologies in the business (e.g., telephone, fax, 
computer). However, the number of questions that can generally be included in a census 
questionnaire is necessarily limited.
186. Because of the limitation on the number of ICT questions that can be included and their 
low periodicity, economic censuses are not generally well suited to monitoring ICT use by 
businesses.
5.3.3 Stand-alone surveys
187. Stand-alone surveys on ICT allow for the collection of significantly more information than 
modules in other surveys. Stand-alone surveys are especially designed to collect information 
on different topics of interest in the measure of ICT use by businesses, such as access to ICT, 
purposes of use, e-commerce, security, skills, etc. that usually go beyond the possibilities of 
a module embedded in an existing business survey.
188. Several developing economies have implemented stand-alone ICT surveys of the business 
sector (see Example 12). These countries have relatively widespread access to ICT in 
comparison with other countries in their region or have an economy increasingly based on 
ICT. In general, in countries that have carried out stand-alone ICT surveys, there is a high 
demand for business ICT indicators from policymakers, the market and society.
189. In some cases, surveys have been carried out by organizations outside the statistical system 
and linked with ICT policymaking institutions. There is a risk in carrying out stand-alone 
ICT surveys outside the national statistical system, due to the limitations on the use of key 
statistical infrastructure such as business registers, data collection systems (call centres, 
trained interviewers in regional or municipal offices, etc.), sampling methodology and the 
possibility that methodologies are not harmonized with those of the national statistical system 
(which are usually linked to international statistical standards).UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 202082
190. The coordination of stand-alone surveys on ICT use by businesses with other ongoing 
or planned work of the national statistical system must be considered from at least two perspectives:
• The first is related to the use of common methodologies. Methodological coordination with existing business surveys requires the use of coherent definitions of statistical units (enterprise, establishment, business, etc.), classifications (such as industry breakdowns) and common concepts (e.g., for income). Such harmonization will facilitate comparison of results on ICT use with those of other surveys (for example, those investigating production, financial results, labour costs, etc.).
• The second is related to minimizing the response burden of businesses participating in many surveys. In some countries, the business sector is intensively surveyed by public and private organizations, and the response burden can be overwhelming. Large businesses are usually included exhaustively (i.e., without sampling) in surveys, thereby having to answer many questionnaires. In addition, some strata may contain a small number of businesses that are therefore surveyed particularly often (such as businesses in the telecommunications sector).
191. In relation to methodological coordination, a key issue is the use of comparable business registers from which samples are drawn. For instance, the implementation of stand-alone surveys based on a sample of businesses drawn from commercial directories (e.g., telephone directories such as ‘yellow pages’) and not statistical business registers can make it impossible to obtain breakdowns comparable to those that would be obtained by using a statistical business register that uses consistent unit concepts and classifies units to the national classification of economic activities.
192. Methodological coordination (between surveys and countries) requires the use of comparable definitions of concepts. In particular, for the calculation of the core indicators on the use of ICT by businesses, it is necessary that surveys adopt the same definition of a business (see Chapter 4) and of an employee (the definition proposed for the indicators proportion of employees using computers and the Internet includes all persons employed by the business (including working proprietors and employees)).
45
45 The ILO definition of an employed person is anyone who worked for remuneration or was self-employed or 
was a family worker for at least one hour in the one-week reference period. Also, persons formally having a job 
and not having performed that job only temporarily within the reference period are considered employed. In countries with a large informal sector, there is an interest in defining employees in the informal sector according to the recommendations of the International Conference of Labour Statisticians (www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/download/guidelines/defempl.pdf).Example 12   Hong Kong, China: The Survey on Information Technology Usage and 
Penetration in the Business Sector 
The Census and Statistics Department of Hong Kong, China (C&SD) conducts an annual Survey 
on Information Technology Usage and Penetration in the Business Sector. Apart from questions on computer and Internet usage, presence and use of a website and e-commerce, it includes items on the IT budget, IT security and use of wireless and mobile technologies, services and applications. C&SD also measures the ICT sector, with a stand-alone Manpower Survey of the IT Sector and compilation of ICT sector statistics from annual economic survey data. In its latest report in 2019, it also included more specific questions related to the reasons for not using the Internet (if applicable), about the mode of use, and on e-commerce.

 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
193. Finally, coordination with existing business surveys is important if, for research purposes, it is 
required to link data at the micro-level (i.e., at the individual business level) in order to analyze 
the relationship between ICT and other variables, such as those related to performance 
(labour productivity, value added, etc.). It is of the utmost importance that the confidentiality 
of individual business information be guaranteed and, if the survey on ICT use is not carried 
out by the statistical office, that the necessary legal arrangements be made according to 
national statistical legislation.
194. Ideally, stand-alone ICT surveys would be based on representative samples of the business 
sector, requiring a sample size that allows for estimation with sufficient precision. Logically, 
stand-alone surveys usually incur higher costs than modules included in an existing survey, 
since they require a specific design, dedicated fieldwork with specialized training for the 
interviewers (if used), independent data processing and dissemination.
195. It is important to recall that, in order to effectively monitor the rapid changes in the information 
economy, surveys should be conducted reasonably frequently. This will allow the compilation 
of time series data. One-off ICT surveys may quickly lose their relevance and should be 
avoided due to their high costs relative to the validity of results over time. International donors 
should consider the national statistical programme before funding such ad-hoc surveys, 
particularly because their sustainability cannot be guaranteed.
5.3.4 Surveys of the ICT sector and ICT trade data
196. In Chapter 4, the ICT sector was defined in terms of the international classification, ISIC. 
It includes classes (4-digit codes) in the manufacturing sector, as well as ICT services. 
Accordingly, surveys of the manufacturing and services sectors will partially cover the ICT 
sector and may provide useful data if the level of detail is sufficient (noting that much of the 
ICT sector is defined in terms of 4-digit ISIC classes). Data that are collected in other industry 
surveys are also useful for the ICT sector. They may include the number of enterprises and 
establishments, turnover and production, value added, labour force information, wages and 
salaries, capital expenditure, expenditure on R&D and innovation.
197. The level of detail to which the ICT sector is defined (that is, 4-digit ISIC codes of economic 
activity) may present challenges in terms of sample size for economy-wide surveys, or even 
surveys covering the whole manufacturing or services sectors (economic censuses would 
not present this problem). NSOs with a high demand for indicators on the ICT sector may 
therefore consider the possibility of increasing the sample size in some classes, if the current 
coverage does not allow offering accurate estimates for these classes or running a stand-
alone survey of the ICT sector.
198. Some countries conduct sectoral trade surveys that may cover the wholesale trade of 
computers, peripheral equipment and software, as well as electronic and telecommunications 
parts and equipment (classes 4651 and 4652 of ISIC Rev. 4). Statistical offices may consider 
increasing the sample size for these classes in trade surveys if the current coverage does 
not allow offering accurate estimates for these classes. Note that an increase in sample size 
entails an increase in the associated costs for collection and data processing and may not be 
sustainable over time for NSOs with scarce resources.
199. One way to improve the coverage of the ICT sector is to collaborate with industry associations 
to identify ICT sector businesses. Further refinement of the classification of these businesses 
may be obtained by cross-checking with statistical directories and business registers. In 
some countries, there is a separate register for ICT businesses that helps to define the in-
scope population.UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 202084
200. In the questionnaire for the ICT sector survey, businesses may be asked a question on their
activities or be invited to self-classify their activities with sufficient level of detail. This enablesexclusion of businesses that are not part of the ICT sector as internationally defined and betterclassification of those that are. Questions on products offered by the business may also beof help in establishing the correct industry (using a correspondence between products andindustries, such as the existing correspondence between the Central Product Classification(CPC) and ISIC
46).
201. Good administrative sources for ICT trade data are foreign trade registers, which aremanaged by customs authorities and are often used as a source to compile trade statistics– either by these institutions or by statistical offices. The regulations for declaring import andexport transactions depend on national legislation, but there are international standards forcompiling foreign trade statistics that are widely used, such as the classification of goodsbased on the HS. Data on exports and imports of ICT goods can be compiled using thedefinition of ICT goods (see Annex 8) as it is based on the HS 2017.
47
202. Surveys to measure exports of ICT and ICT-enabled services would benefit from the advantage that only a few enterprises sell these services abroad. In this case surveys can focus on thoseenterprises most likely to produce ICT-enabled services (or potentially ICT-enabled servicesproviders) rather than covering the entire economy.
5.3.5 Surveys for e-commerce measurement
203. Adding questions to existing household and enterprise surveys and setting up stand-alonesurveys are also potential strategies to collect data on e-commerce. The first option has theadvantage of being relatively easy and cheap to implement but faces limitations in terms of thenumber of questions that could be included, not to increase the burden on respondents andsurvey enumerators. The second option is more costly and time consuming to implement butcould provide more detailed information. Depending on the country, both options could berelevant. The inclusion of e-commerce questions in European enterprise surveys is illustratedin Example 6 above, and in the Eurostat model questionnaire in Annex 5.
204. However, such surveys would only measure part of the e-commerce landscape. For example,micro enterprises are often excluded from business surveys although they have a lot to gainfrom e-commerce and other opportunities in the digital economy, particularly in developingcountries. Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) e-commerce is typically not being measured inofficial statistics, yet this has become an increasingly important component, especially in theuse of social media platforms in developing countries.
205. For these reasons and given the decreasing response rates for household and enterprisesurveys, as well as the need to optimize resources in data collection, supplementary big datasources can be used to complete survey information for e-commerce measurement. Therequired information is usually owned by the digital platforms in the private sector. To copewith their reluctance to share e-commerce data, the establishment of strong private-publicpartnerships based on win-win cooperation would be required.
206. As an alternative approach to complete e-commerce data from surveys, some countries havestarted to identify e-commerce in their balance of payments reporting (e.g., the Netherlandsand Oman), while others have set up ICT Satellite Accounts to estimate the contribution ofe-commerce within the ICT sector (see Example 4 above on Malaysia).

 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
An alternative to surveys: observation of business behaviour in the digital economy
207. Modules and stand-alone surveys are based on self-assessments and self-reporting of each 
business on its activities on the digital economy. For this reason, the information provided by surveys may be affected by subjective factors, such as the understanding of the items and definitions in the questionnaire, the cognitive biases of the respondents or the motivations to complete the questionnaire properly. As alternatives to surveys, the increasing traceability of digital activities recorded in big data sets and the recent developments in behavioural-experimental analysis can help measure digital behaviour without relying on businesses self-reporting. Digital activities of companies, from the existence of a corporate website to e-commerce transactions, are recorded in big data sets, which can even be publicly available (see Example 13).
208. An example of publicly available big data are the contents of company websites that can be freely accessed online and describing the potential e-commerce activities offered by the company. Publicly available big data sources can be automatically downloaded using methods of web scraping or using the downloading functionalities provided by the source, such as Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) or direct downloading functionalities. Accessibility to publicly available big data may be compromised by technical challenges, since these sources are not in general structured, include textual information and do not apply classification systems. However, most of the big data that can be used to observe digital behaviour are owned by private companies, such as telecom operators or online platforms, which compromises data availability for policymakers or researchers. Cross-jurisdictional regulatory incompatibilities, as well as business models, privacy, confidentiality and security issues limit the use of big data for the measurement of the digital economy. New private-public business models and incentives are required to enhance big data.
209. Companies’ behaviour in the digital economy can also be observed in controlled environments using experiments. This approach is useful to quantify the impact of ICT policies on companies’ digital behaviour and to provide policymakers with empirical evidence to design effective policies. Roughly speaking, experiments compare how companies behave under alternative policy designs (experimental treatments). Experiments are also useful to quantify policy impacts that can be attributed to the policy itself, isolating the effects of the policy from those of the evolution of the environment. The core of the experimental method is the random Example 13   Europe: Measuring pur chases of digital goods and services using public 
data 
In Europe, the International Public Procurement Initiative (IPPI) led by the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Trade, is a disruptive project aimed at measuring and characterizing public procurement market, including cross-border procurement flows and the economic assessment of barriers to public procurement. Using a combination of web crawling procedures and data downloading using APIs, IPPI acquired and harmonized publicly available data on 40 million contracts awarded by the central, subcentral government, as well as SOEs and other entities, from almost 1,000 big data sources (e-procurement and transparency portals) in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, Thailand and the US. The harmonized dataset, after enrichment with data matching methods and integration with surveys and official information from National Accounts and Government Financial Statistics, made feasible a detailed analysis of public purchases in these countries, including ICT goods and services.

allocation of companies to the different treatment groups. Then, and if randomization makes 
all the treatment groups perfectly comparable, the differences in the digital behaviour can be attributed to the exposition to the behavioural intervention in the treatment group.
210. The implementation of behavioural field experiments raises significant logistical and ethicalconcerns, which limit their application. Behavioural Economics Experiments (BEEs) providea more feasible alternative to observe digital behaviour (see Example 14). In a BEE, a
person responsible for a company is invited to make their decisions in a gamified controlled
environment. The central feature of a BEE is that the decisions made by the participants havean actual impact, for instance, by considering variable economic incentives depending on thesubjects’ decision and random changes in the gamified environment. Application of variable
incentives only increase the attention paid during the participation in the experiment and
induces in the respondent a mental state like that of real decision-making situation.
211. There are several methods of data collection according to the nature of the contact betweenthe data provider (respondent) and the data producer (statistical office). They are personal(face-to-face) interviews, personal telephone interviews, questionnaires sent by ordinary
mail, forms posted on web pages, acquisition of Big Data and economic experiments.
Combinations of the different data collection methods are also used in some countries, inorder to select the most suitable method of contact for different kinds of businesses.
212. Table 15 describes the relative advantages and disadvantages of each data collection
method. In developing economies, the selection of data collection method should consider
the transport and communications infrastructure of the country, including:
•Density and quality of roads and railways (especially if interviewers must cover rural areas);
•Efficiency of the postal service (including rural areas);
•Easy identification and accuracy of postal addresses, and
•Density of the telephone network.
213. Usually, the best approach is to have a mix of techniques, according to the location ofbusinesses (urban/rural), their size and industry.Example 14  Europe: Analyzing cybersecure behaviour of SMES
The EC research project Supporting Cybersinsurance from a Behavioural Choice Perspective 
(CYBECO) implemented a BEE to measure the impact of alternative behavioural interventions 
to promote cybersecure behaviour in European SMEs. In this experiment, 2,000 SMEs in four 
European countries were provided with an initial endowment to invest in protection measures 
and/or cyberinsurance policies. At the end of the experiment, SMEs could suffe r, or not, a 
random cyberattack and receive a payment, with a probability depending on their protection 
level and an impact depending on the cyberinsurance coverage. The experiment allowed for 
establishing relevant empirical evidence for policymaking, such as the lack of risk aversion 
between cyberprotection and cyberinsurance or the effi cacy of behavioural interventions based 
in social norm to increase the cybersecurity level of SMEs.

 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
214. For surveys on ICT use by businesses (be they modules of business surveys or stand-alone 
surveys), the use of a combination of personal and telephone interviews may be the best 
option. The fast evolution of ICT technology and uses (and the corresponding definitions 
referred in the ICT surveys) often necessitates helping respondents to provide accurate 
answers, and this is largely provided by the interviewers and in written instructions. Telephone 
interviews can complement data collection, particularly with requests to complete missing 
data. Collection of data using methods based on behaviour observation, such as big data 
acquisition or economic experiments, is also a recommended option to avoid potential 
respondents’ lack of understanding or motivation when completing surveys. Before choosing 
a particular collection method, pilot tests to measure the time needed to complete the 
questionnaire and the understandability of questions should be carried out on a small sample 
of businesses from a variety of industries and size classes.
Method Main advantages Main disadvantages
Face-to-face personal 
interviewThis is the most direct method of 
collecting information. It facilitates direct 
interaction between the interviewer 
and the interviewee, allowing for 
checking and follow-up questions. An 
interviewer can also assist respondents 
in answering complex questions and 
can clarify concepts such as definitions 
of ICTs. Because the interviewer is in 
view, s/he can use visual prompts such 
as prompt cards.
In addition, face-to-face interviews 
are especially useful for questions 
about opinions or impressions, and 
for surveys that take a long time to 
complete.
The technique usually produces lower 
non-response rates. Data collection 
can be managed efficiently with specific 
software (Computer Assisted Personal 
Interviewing – CAPI, see below).Interviewers are part of the measurement 
tool and they can induce important biases 
if they have not received suitable training.
High personnel costs may be incurred (for 
hiring and training interviewers). However, 
this could be a minor issue in developing 
economies where salaries of interviewers 
are low, or agreements are reached with 
certain institutions to provide part-time 
interviewers (such as university students).
In developing economies with poor 
quality transport infrastructure, reaching 
businesses located in some country areas 
may prove difficult.
Telephone personal 
interviewAlthough to a lesser extent than 
the face-to-face personal interview, 
telephone interviewing allows direct 
interaction between the interviewer and 
interviewee.
It is a fast and relatively inexpensive 
way to collect information, since a 
small number of interviewers from a 
single call centre can carry out a great 
number of interviews.
The data collection can be managed 
efficiently with specific software 
(Computer Assisted Telephoning 
Interviewing – CATI, see below).Correct and comprehensive telephone 
numbers may not be available, particularly 
in developing economies where mobile 
telephony may be more common than fixed 
telephone.
Interviews must be relatively short since 
a long telephone conversation can be 
perceived as an annoyance. Some people 
also feel that it is intrusive to be interviewed 
by telephone.
Telephone interviews may not be suitable 
for collecting quantitative information, for 
which the interviewee may have to check 
business records.
The non-response rate is usually larger than 
for face-to-face interviews (but lower than 
for mail-based surveys).Table 15  Data collection methodsUNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 202088
Method Main advantages Main disadvantages
Interview assisted by 
computer (CAPI/CATI)CAPI and CATI systems can eliminate 
errors of flow and data consistency and 
can thus improve input data quality and 
reduce the time for data capture and 
validation.
Questionnaires can possibly be 
customized based on available 
information about the business.
Modern IT equipment such as PDAs or 
smartphones may present a cheap and 
comfortable tool for data collection.CAPI and CATI techniques require 
interviewers with some technical skills.
CAPI and CATI systems are usually based 
on commercial software that may be costly. 
Skilled staff are required to adapt the 
software to the questionnaire.
CAPI requires that interviewers carry costly 
IT equipment, which can be damaged, 
stolen, etc. during field operations.
In developing economies with poor road 
networks, there is a risk of damaging the 
equipment.
Mail survey This method is relatively inexpensive, 
and the statistical office can send 
the same measurement instrument 
(questionnaire) to many businesses.
It allows the respondent to complete 
the questionnaire at his or her 
convenience.
It eliminates the problem of interviewer 
bias though note that interviewer 
follow-up (e.g., for non-response or 
inconsistent answers) can potentially 
introduce bias if not managed properly, 
and if questionnaires are not properly 
designed and tested, they can 
introduce bias to the survey results.Requires separate data entry unless 
advanced Optical Character Recognition 
(OCR) tools are available. It usually suffers 
from high non-response rates.
It is not designed for detailed written 
responses, but for numerical questions or 
those that can be answered by selecting 
a limited list of choices (including yes/no 
responses).
The lack of help from an interviewer can 
produce information of low quality. It 
therefore requires clear questions and 
instructions.
Delays in mailing back questionnaires can 
induce delays in the survey. In developing 
economies with a low-quality postal 
system, such delays may be prohibitive.
Some of the problems inherent to a 
postal survey can be partially solved by, 
for instance, use of written or telephone 
reminders to reduce non-response rates. In 
addition, data quality can often be improved 
if a telephone helpline is available.
Electronic survey With the growth in ICT skills and 
availability of ICT, possibilities for 
electronic surveys have increased. 
Data collection mechanisms can be of 
several types, but the most common 
are electronic questionnaires sent by 
e-mail or posted on web pages that 
respondents can access.
This method has most the advantages 
of mail surveys but is usually faster 
and cheaper. Because respondents 
complete the questionnaire 
electronically, manual data entry is not 
required, and edits can be applied at 
the time of data entry (and resolved by 
the respondent).Businesses that can be surveyed this way 
do not cover the entire business population, 
in particular in developing economies with 
low ICT penetration. This will cause either 
bias in the data, or the necessity of using 
another method as well (e.g., mail out 
questionnaires) for data capture.
There is an extra need for technology to 
ensure security and confidentiality of data 
and for staff with the training and skills to 
handle the data collection tools. Costs 
associated with this expertise can offset 
savings offered by electronic data capture.
The technique is in general not suitable to 
be used as the only channel for collecting 
data. However, if complemented with other 
methods, it can be a useful tool.89
 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
Quality control of the data collection
215. The quality of the data collected will determine the quality of aggregate ICT indicators, 
whichever survey vehicle is used. Controls at data entry stage (whether by respondents or 
interviewers) are more effective than corrections at later stages. In this sense, computer-
assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) or computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) 
systems enable good quality control, since data collection and entry are simultaneous. Note 
that controlling for data quality after data capture requires actions that can be costly or 
introduce bias to the results, for example:
• Re-contacting a business and asking it to respond to, or clarify, questions that were asked 
perhaps weeks or months before is not always feasible, annoys the respondent and gives 
a poor image of the statistical office; in addition, it can significantly increase the costs of 
the operation if the number of re-contacts is high;
• Estimating responses to individual questions that have not been answered, or amending 
answers that are not valid, can be a complex technical exercise (though should result in 
unbiased responses if done correctly), and
• Ignoring an incorrect questionnaire, although sometimes the only solution, is an action with 
consequences, since the effective sample diminishes and bias may be introduced.
216. Although it is impossible to carry out a survey without errors in data collection, there are 
measures that can be put into practice by statistical offices, which will help to minimize the 
error rate. Examples of such measures are:
• Establishing good frames that include in-scope businesses and are free of coverage errors 
such as inactive businesses or erroneous addresses;
• Providing suitable training to interviewers on the questionnaire contents (especially required 
for complex technical concepts), and on dealing with respondents;
• Preparing questionnaires so that questions are worded in a correct, clear and unambiguous 
manner, and respondents can perceive a logical flow in the order of questions (especially 
in self-administered questionnaires);
• Filtering the collected data by a series of controls that are applied at the moment of data 
capture and in the data entry process;Method Main advantages Main disadvantages
Big data acquisition Establishing strategic agreements with 
private owners of big data sources 
could facilitate the acquisition of 
relevant data covering actual company 
behaviour at a reduced cost. 
Publicly available big data sources 
could be acquired by applying web 
scraping methods and APIs, with no 
cost to the respondent and avoiding 
hypothetical response biases.Big data sources are not in general 
representative of the corresponding 
populations and the estimations from these 
sources need to be corrected by applying 
results from representative samples or 
official sources.
Behavioural economic 
experiments (BEEs)BEEs are flexible methods to observe 
actual digital behaviour, allowing the 
control of the conditions under which 
these observations are undertaken. BEEs provide formation on company’s 
digital behaviour in gamified environments. 
The validity of the conclusion for real 
decision-making (ecological validity) needs 
to be supported by a sound experimental 
design.UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 202090
• Giving wide publicity before the start of the survey, highlighting the relevance of data 
collection for national policies and therefore the need for respondents’ collaboration. 
This may include a mention of the compulsory response required in countries where the 
statistical law grants this; and
• Establishing a policy of incentives and sanctions that encourage the provision of good 
answers to interviews or questionnaires.91
 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
Chapter 6 –  Model questions and questionnaires for measuring 
ICT use in businesses
217. This chapter presents model questions corresponding to the core ICT use indicators that 
were introduced in Chapter 4, including those added in this revision. It also discusses the 
structure of modules and questionnaires that could be adapted by countries planning on 
including an ICT use module in an existing business survey or undertaking a stand-alone 
survey. Two questionnaires are presented in this chapter: the model questionnaire on ICT use 
by businesses, and the model questionnaire for exports of ICT-enabled (or digitally delivered) 
services. 
218. The model questions (for both questionnaires) presented in this chapter may need to be 
translated into local languages and adapted for other conditions, such as cultural norms. 
However, in order to respect international comparability, care must be taken that changes 
made do not alter the meaning of the questions nor any inherent logic (e.g., the populations 
to which they refer). 
219. A complete model questionnaire for the core indicators on ICT use by businesses (B1 to B12) 
is shown in Annex 2. Countries wishing to go beyond those core indicators are referred to the 
model questionnaires of the OECD and Eurostat (shown in Annexes 4 and 5).
220. A model questionnaire for collecting information about exports of ICT-enabled services 
(digitally delivered services) to compile indicators ICT7 and ICT8 is presented in Annex 10. 
As mentioned in Section 4.5, the questionnaire comprises questions to identify the exports 
of services delivered remotely over ICT networks, by type of service, mode of delivery and 
partner economy.
221. It should be noted that indicators ICT1 to ICT6 are not collected through business surveys, 
but generally from trade data.
222. Model questions for the proposed indicators on the use of mobile phones (indicated as M1 to 
M4), which are not part of the list of core indicators, were also presented in Table 6. 
223. Apart from the technical recommendations for the preparation of questions to measure the 
ICT indicators, other important issues are to be taken into consideration, such as the use of 
appropriate language (providing definitions and explanations to technical terms, prevention 
of bias due to the wording of questions, avoiding the use of acronyms without their definition, 
use of different official languages in a country, etc.), clear logical flow (filtering questions, order 
of questions, etc.), layout of the questionnaire (separate sections, visual display, etc.), and 
inclusion of instructions to the interviewers (also called “prompts”). Good practices in the 
design of questionnaires are usually known and applied by NSOs and should be valid also 
for ICT modules or stand-alone ICT surveys. They are therefore not discussed in this Manual.
6.1 - Model questions for a module on use of ICT by businesses
224. The inclusion of a module on the use of ICT in existing business surveys (‘survey vehicles’) is an 
option that developing economies could consider as an alternative to carrying out stand-alone 
surveys. In any case, several developing countries have already implemented stand-alone 
surveys on ICT in support of ICT policies for development. The model questions presented in 
this chapter enable the production of the core indicators on ICT use by businesses and have 
already been used by several countries that undertake ICT use surveys.48
48 With equivalent meaning though not necessarily with the same wording.UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 202092
225. The survey questionnaire in which the module on ICT is included will typically contain
a number of general (background) questions on the business activity, such as industry inwhich it operates (principal, secondary and ancillary activities), principal economic indicators
(turnover and its breakdown by activities and/or products, number of employed persons and
their categories or gender, location, type of property, etc.). For international comparability, itis suggested that countries apply international standards (such as ISIC codes for economicactivity or ILO standards for the measurement of employment 
49) for the recording of such
variables. While all these variables can be used for in-depth analysis of ICT indicators, theyare not strictly part of the module on ICT, and therefore also not further discussed in this
Manual.
226. The development of a module on the use of ICT consists of choosing a limited number of
high priority and measurable topics, selecting appropriate questions and structuring themlogically within a module. The module, in turn, should be logically placed within the survey
vehicle questionnaire.
227. The ordering of items in a questionnaire is particularly important, as respondents will generally
respond better if they perceive a coherent flow of information through the form. In addition,some questions lead to others through logical filters
50 (see Box 8). When implementing the data 
collection with CAPI tools, the questionnaire can be prepared so that the answers to filteringquestions automatically lead to the next question in the logical order of the questionnaire.
49 Relevant issues r egarding the measurement of employment include: type of relation to the business (ownership, 
contractual, informal); dedication (full-time vs part-time); and the time reference (information given at a 
certain moment of year <reference date> or average number of employed persons <in a reference period> ). 
The adoption of international standards is highly recommended.
50 Several assumptions ar e made for the logical filtering of model questions for the core indicators. If a business 
does not have a computer, it is still considered that it may be able to use the Internet (e.g., by using a mobile 
phone or by accessing the Internet through community centres or from home).Box 8  Pr esentation of a filter question
The question on the proportion (or number) of employees using computers should only be asked 
if the businesses has a computer(s). Therefore, a logical filter could take the following form:
Question i) 
Did your business use computer(s) during <reference period>?
•Yes Go to question i+1)
•No Go to question i+2)
Question i+1) What proportion of persons employed in your business routinely used a computer at work during <reference period>? ……… (From 0% to 100%)
Question i+2) 
……..93
 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
228. It is possible to order the model questions into sections (see Figure 5) as follows:
• Section A: General information about the use of ICT by the business and the available 
infrastructure. The related model questions provide data for core indicators B1, B2, B6, 
B10, and B11.
• Section B: Information on how the business uses Internet in its operations, including the 
activities for which the Internet is used and whether the business has a web presence. The 
related model questions provide data for core indicators B3, B4, B5, B7, B8, B9, and B12.
• Section C: Any general (background) information about the business that is required but is 
not included in the survey vehicle.
229. Most of the core indicators require information in respect to a single reference period (indicators 
B1, B2, B3, B4, B7, B8, B9 and B12). In order to achieve international comparability, it 
is recommended that countries use a 12-month reference period51, and refer to it in the 
question. Countries wishing to collect information about other periods as well can do this 
by using period rows or columns to collect data for consecutive years (t-1, t, t+1 referring to 
the previous, current and next years). Reference dates are used for core indicators B5, B6, 
B10 and B11 and are usually the last day of the reference period or shortly after it. As with 
reference periods, the reference date should be referred to in the question and countries can 
collect information about more than one reference date (see Box 9).
51 Note that for indicators on the use of ICT by individuals, the reference period is limited to the three previous 
months.Figure 5 Schematic structure of a module on the use of ICT by businesses

230. For ease of reference, indicator descriptions in Table 4 propose model questions to collect the 
information for the core indicators (in the order of indicators rather than logical questionnaire 
order). For each indicator, the following information is provided: a suggested wording for the 
question (to be translated into the local language, respecting as far as possible its meaning), 
valid response items (Yes/No or a list of valid responses), and notes, including the applicable 
population for each question. Annex 2 shows the UNCTAD model questionnaire on use of ICT, 
which is suitable for use as a module in a survey vehicle or as a stand-alone questionnaire.
231. With respect to procedures for calculating the indicators (see Box 10), it should be noted 
that all core indicators are expressed as proportions of businesses satisfying certain 
conditions (as indicated by a particular answer or combination of answers to questions). The 
statistical estimation of a proportion depends on the survey design (complete enumeration 
of businesses, simple random sampling, stratified random sampling or a combination of 
designs). More information on survey design can be found in Chapter 7, while Annex 6 
describes the statistical estimation of a proportion.
232. Core indicators broken down by industry, size and location are compiled by cross-tabulating 
the information collected through the model questions with that of the background questions 
(generally present in the main questionnaire of the survey vehicle or as extra questions in a 
stand-alone survey). The proposed breakdowns (disaggregation) and the classifications that 
are recommended are included in the indicator fiches of Chapter 4.
233. The advantage of embedding a module on ICT in an existing business survey is that the 
number of possible crossing variables is potentially large. For example, ICT questions included 
in a survey on business innovation would allow studying the role of ICT in innovation patterns.Box 9 Presentation of a question on ICT activities in multiple years
The question on web presence can be presented in the following way to allow recording of 
historical information and expectations for the future.
Question: Does your business have a web presence?
Yes, had a web presence as of <ref date, year t-1> (e.g., 31 December 2019)
Yes, established a web presence during <year t> (e.g., 2019)
No, but plan to establish a web presence in <year t+1> (e.g., 2020)
No, do not plan to establish a web presence in <year t+1> (e.g., 2020)
Note that even though the questions following the first one refer to periods (for ease of 
understanding), the information is in respect to a reference date, which is the last day of the year.
An alternative presentation for collecting this information is to have a yes/no filter question, where 
a ‘yes’ leads to a question with the first two options above and a ‘no’ leads to one with the third 
and fourth options.95
 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
6.2 - Model questionnaires for a stand-alone ICT use survey
234. Some developing economies are interested in measuring ICT topics that go beyond the 
core ICT indicators and would therefore, almost certainly, opt for a stand-alone survey (see 
Example 15). As mentioned in Chapter 4, such topics could cover the following areas:
• Business use of mobile phones;
• ICT security measures in place and security problems experienced by the business;
• Current and capital expenditure on ICT goods and services, including the mechanisms for 
financing them;
• Uses of the Web, such as marketing research;
• Availability of ICT skills in the business and provision of training; 
• More in-depth questions on e-commerce; and
• Barriers to the adoption of ICT.Box 10 Selection of responses for the calculation of an indicator
The calculation of the indicator Proportion of businesses with narrowband access to the Internet 
requires selecting the surveyed businesses that answered ‘yes’ to the question “Did your 
business use the Internet during the reference period?” and selected either/both the categories 
corresponding to narrowband (analogue modem, other narrowband) in the question “How did 
your business connect to the Internet during <the reference period>?” The estimation formula 
for the indicator will depend on the sample weights given to each selected business according 
to the sample design. Note that, as multiple responses to the connection question are possible, 
a business may report both narrowband and broadband access. The percentage of businesses 
with narrowband access plus the percentage with broadband access will therefore generally 
exceed 100 per cent.UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 202096
Example 15  Brazil: ICT Enterprise Survey
Brazil conducts a comprehensive, stand-alone survey to measure the access to and use of 
ICT in Brazilian enterprises with 10 or more employed persons. The survey aims at measuring 
enterprises’ presence and activities on the web and social media, e-commerce and e-government 
activities, as well as digital capabilities and skills - conferring a wide view of the digital economy 
in Brazil.
The ICT Enterprises Survey has been conducted regularly since 2005 by the Brazilian Internet 
Steering Committee (CGI.br), through the Regional Centre for Studies on the Development of the 
Information Society (Cetic.br), a department of the Brazilian Network Information Centre (NIC.br). 
In its 13th edition the survey comprises the following modules:
• Module A: General information on ICT systems;
• Module B: Internet use;
• Module C: Electronic government;
• Module D: Cybersecurity
• Module E: Electronic commerce;
• Module F: ICT skills;
• Module G: Software;
• Module H: New advanced technologies (robotics, 3D printing, big data analytics, cloud 
computing).
The survey’s results highlight the progress and, especially, describe the main challenges that arise 
in the competitive realm as a result of digital transformation, focusing on the digital environment 
of organizations and reveal the extent to which Brazilian enterprises are tapping into the potential 
unleashed by ICT. 
Data collected allow conducting an in-depth analysis of the current situation of enterprises within 
the context of the digital economy, including the following issues:
• ICT access and use by small, medium and large enterprises and the availability of ICT 
infrastructure (broadband speed, type of broadband connections, networking facilities, 
usage of software and applications, etc.);
• E-commerce readiness (means of selling online, payment methods, B2B, B2C and B2G 
transactions) 
• Online presence and their digital environment (websites and social networking websites, 
engagement in e-commerce and e-government activities);
• Digital capabilities and skills, exploring the capabilities of enterprises to adopt software, 
cloud computing and other ICT-based applications in their processes; and
• Enterprises using technologies related to the digital economy, like big data analytics, 
robotics and 3D printing.97
 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
235. If a country decides to collect more indicators on the use of ICT through a stand-alone business 
survey, it could be useful to refer to the experiences of OECD and Eurostat countries; the ICT statistics metadata of OECD countries could be of particular value. Most OECD/EU countries have used stand-alone ICT surveys that enable compilation of reasonably comparable ICT statistics.
236. The approach followed by the OECD’s WPIIS (now WPMADE) led to a model ICT use questionnaire, dealing with key aspects of readiness and intensity. In some situations, measures of the impact of the ICT use on business performance may be achieved by linking data from ICT use surveys with those collected by economic surveys (measuring turnover, labour, investment, etc.).
237. The OECD model questionnaire (Annex 4) has three sections. Section A includes questions on the use of computers, Internet and other networks, as well as IT security measures and experiences. Section B goes into more detail about how ICT is used by the business. It covers a range of e-business processes including e-commerce (via the Internet and other computer networks); barriers to, and benefits of, Internet selling; and features of the business’ web site. Section C collects the background information required to calculate values and to classify data. Not all surveys will need to include all background questions, as the information needed may be available from other sources, such as the business register. Questions in Section C should include: the main activity of the business (indicating its industry), its size (number of employees) and its turnover (indicating size but mainly used as a denominator to calculate the The target population of the survey was defined by using the National Classification of Economic Activities (Classificação Nacional de Atividades Econômicas - CNAE 2.0), which is the basic framework used to classify registered Brazilian enterprises according to their economic activities. CNAE 2.0 has been officially adopted by the National Statistical System and by the federal agencies that manage administrative registries. It is derived from the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC 4.0), and does not distinguish by type of ownership, legal nature, size of business, mode of operation or legality of activity.
The survey methodology has the following aspects: 
• Unit of analysis:  The enterprise, which the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística 
– IBGE defines as a legal entity characterized as a firm or company that includes a 
set of economic activities conducted in one or more local units (a physical space, usually a permanent location, where one or more economic activities are carried out, corresponding to one of the enterprise’s addresses);
• Sampling Plan: The sampling plan was stratified, and the enterprises were randomly selected within each stratum;
• Survey Frame and Source of Information: The Central Register of Enterprises provided consolidation and updating of enterprises and other formal organization information recorded in the Company Registration Number from the Secretariat of Revenue and its local units that responded to the IBGE economic surveys and/or submitted the Annual List of Social Information (Relação Anual de Informações Sociais – RAIS); 
• Data Collection: Data of interest for the survey was gathered using a structured questionnaire, with open- and closed-ended questions (when applicable);  
• Data Collection Method: Enterprises were contacted for interview using a structured questionnaire by means of the computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) technique.

values associated with e-commerce selling). Other background variables may be included if 
required for further analysis or policy purposes (see Box 11 below).
238. Figure 6 schematically outlines the questionnaire’s contents, adding the topic of mobile phone 
use (see also Table 12). Inherent in its structure is a filtering logic based on certain assumptions 
(such as ‘businesses without a computer can still use the Internet’) and designed to move 
respondents efficiently through the questionnaire.
239. Eurostat model questionnaires typically cover more topics than the OECD model and rotate 
topics between years. For instance, the 2020 Eurostat questionnaire had separate modules 
on 3D printing or robotics, while the 2019 included more detail on ICT security.
240. Model questions are provided in this Manual only for the core ICT indicators (including use 
of ICT and exports of digitally delivered services) and for mobile phone use by businesses. It 
is suggested that additional questions, if required, be adapted from the OECD and Eurostat 
model questionnaires presented in Annexes 4 and 5.
241. Indicator descriptions for M1 to M4 (see Table 6) offer possible model questions on mobile 
phone use to include in ICT surveys. Mobile phone use indicators and model questions 
will be further developed as users’ needs and mobile services available become clearer. 
Countries interested in collecting mobile phone indicators may also want to include questions 
on the use of fixed telephone in businesses, which would allow comparison between the two 
technologies.Box 11 Background variables in the Eurostat questionnaires
The model questionnaires proposed by Eurostat for the Member States of the European Union 
to carry out the Community Survey on ICT Usage and E-Commerce in Enterprises include the 
following background variables: 1) Main economic activity of the enterprise, during the reference 
year, 2) Average number of persons employed, during the reference year, 3) Total purchases of 
goods and services (in value terms, excluding VAT) for the reference year, 4) Total turnover (in 
value terms, excluding VAT) for the reference year, 5) location (convergence/non-convergence 
region). The last variable is defined in terms of a classification of European regions by level of 
GDP per capita with respect to the EU average.

6.3 - Model questions on exports of ICT-enabled services
242. In 2015 UNCTAD launched a project to measure international trade in ICT-enabled services. 
Between 2015 and 2016, a Task Group on ICT Services and ICT-enabled Services was created to coordinate efforts and reduce the risk of duplicating work. In a second phase of the project (2016 to 2017) a model questionnaire for an enterprise survey was developed and pilot surveys were conducted in Costa Rica, India and, partly, in Thailand.

243. The development of the questionnaire took carefully into account the feedback received from 
the private sector, in order to ensure that questions would be relevant and understandable 
to respondents. The piloting was carried out by face-to-face interviews, while the surveys 
were collected using online questionnaires. It was necessary to provide some support to the 
respondents in the form of either a telephone platform, an email contact or a web forum. This 
helped to ensure a proper understanding of the questionnaire and high quality of the results. 
The provision of technical support to respondents is another way to improve the response 
rate.
244. The UNCTAD model questionnaire on exports of ICT-enabled services was revised based on 
the results of the three pilot surveys implemented. The revised questionnaire is attached in 
Annex 3.
245. The model questionnaire includes definitions of concepts and classifications of services and 
is structured as follows: 
• Section A collects general information about the enterprise, including control and overseas 
presence, employment, turnover, main activity, value of total exports of services, and 
modes of delivery of services.
• Section B includes filter questions on services exports to be included, related to the type 
of services.
• Section C provides details of services exports delivered remotely over ICT networks (ICT-
enabled services), including value and main partner economies (trading partners).101
 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
Chapter 7 –  Designing ICT business surveys and processing data
This chapter focuses on the survey design, the processing of collected data and the calculation 
of indicators for business surveys on the digital economy. The topics covered in this chapter are 
part of the Phases 2, 4, 5 and 6 (Design, Collect, Process and Analyze) of the GSBPM presented 
in Chapter 5. They include:
a. The design of business surveys on the digital economy:
• Definition of target populations and statistical units;
• Preparation of population frames; and
• Sample design and selection.
b. The processing of collected business data on the digital economy:
• Data editing, the treatment of missing data and misclassified units;
• Weighting (grossing-up) procedures for sample data, to produce aggregates; and
• Calculation of digital economy indicators from survey data.
246. While much of the general information presented in this chapter will apply generally to 
business surveys (and therefore to all business surveys on the digital economy), the emphasis 
is on ICT use surveys.
247. The information on survey design is relevant mainly for stand-alone ICT use surveys or for 
those on exports of ICT-enabled services. The design of modules to be embedded into an 
existing survey will be influenced by the statistical features of the survey vehicle. However, 
where possible, the recommendations given here should be considered when designing such 
modules. Recommendations on data processing will apply to both stand-alone surveys and 
modules, though in the latter case, survey vehicle practices may also determine some aspects 
of processing (for instance, treatment of misclassified units and weighting procedures).
7.1 - Business surveys on the digital economy
7.1.1 Target population and scope
248. The target population for a statistical collection (whether a sample survey or a census) is the 
group of statistical units that are of interest. The target population is defined by the scope 
of the survey, which is based on attributes of the units. In the case of business surveys, the 
scope (and therefore target population) is usually defined in terms of economic activities 
performed (i.e., the industries in which the units operate), size of units (expressed in terms of 
the number of persons employed and/or turnover) and, in some cases, location.
249. Target populations for surveys of ICT use in the business sector vary between countries. 
They may also change within a country over time. For example, a country may decide to 
investigate the use of ICT in the manufacturing sector in a first phase, and then extend 
the target population in subsequent surveys to include the agriculture and services sectors. 
The target can also change with respect to size thresholds: several EU countries started by 
collecting information about ICT use by businesses with 10 or more employees and some 
have, more recently, undertaken surveys on micro-businesses (i.e., those with fewer than 10 
employees).
250. The target population for the surveys of ICT sector and exports of ICT-enabled services are 
more restricted. In the former case, the coverage includes only the enterprises with the ISIC 
Rev. 4 code presented in Chapter 4 of this Manual . The latter survey covers only businesses UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 2020102
exporting services that could be digitally delivered. A recommendation of the ISIC Rev. 4 
codes that could be used to characterize such business are presented in Section 4.5.
251. As with other business surveys, the scope and target population for statistical investigationson ICT use ar
e usually defined in terms of:
•Economic activity
•Business size and, sometimes
•Geographical location.
252. The use of international classifications, such as ISIC, to define industry or activity enhancescomparability of statistical results across countries. Most national classifications
53 have
established corr
espondences with regional classifications (such as the European NACE or
the North American NAICS) and with ISIC. At the most detailed level, ISIC codes consist of4-digit identifiers of economic activities (for ISIC Rev. 4, there are approximately 420 classes,238 groups, 88 divisions and 21 Sections).
54 International working groups continuously revise
the adequacy of international classifications and revisions are adopted at the highest level bythe UNSC. This Manual will describe industries in terms of ISIC Rev. 4 codes.
253. In developing economies, the scope of business surveys of ICT is recommended to beas large as possible to better suit country requirements. In particular, the agriculture andmining sectors are important in many developing economies and the use of ICT for specificpurposes (such as getting price information via mobile phone where Internet and fixedtelephone lines are unavailable) can increase economic returns in an important way. Hotelsand restaurants (an important element of tourism activities) make up an industry, the ICT useof which developing economies may have a particular interest in measuring. Moreover, thefacilities that e-tourism increasingly provides to foreign customers (e.g., information aboutdestinations, reservations and payment online) has favored the economic development ofnew destinations in developing economies.
254. The Manual encourages a broader scope than the OECD recommendation for its member
countries, suggesting that developing economies could extend the scope to cover all theactivities in the 21 sections of the ISIC Rev. 4, including agriculture, forestry and fishing;mining and quarrying; and arts, entertainment and recreation activities. The inclusion of anICT use module embedded in an economy-wide business survey may favor a broader scope.
255. However, this Manual recommends considering separately for the target population of the
ISIC Rev. 4 sections corresponding to the public sector and households. The coverage ofactivities related to education may need specific surveys to compile the core indicators onuse of ICT in education
55. Specifically, countries should consider separately the following ISIC
Rev. 4 sections within the target population: Section O (public administration and defense;compulsory social security), Section P (education), Section T (activities of households asemployers; undifferentiated goods and services; producing activities of households for ownuse), and Section U (activities of extraterritorial organizations and bodies).
256. A common scope criterion for ICT use surveys is business size based on the number ofemployees. 
There is no universal categorization of businesses based on this criterion, but
53 National classifications are available at https://unstats.un.org/unsd/classifications/Econ
54 ISIC Rev. 4 are available at https://unstats.un.org/unsd/classifications/Econ/ISIC.cshtml
55 The UNESCO Institute of Statistics (UIS) has released a Guide to Measuring Information and Communication 
Technologies (ICT) in Education, which identifies sets of core and supplemental (extended) indicators utilized as 
part of its Regional Questionnaire on Statistics of Information and Education Technologies (ICT) in Education. See http://uis.unesco.org/en/topic/information-and-communication-technologies-ict103
 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
in many countries, businesses are classified as micro-businesses (0 to 9 employees), small 
(10 to 49), medium (50 to 249) and large (250 or more). This size classification is consistent with OECD and Partnership recommendations (although the OECD suggests a minimum 
size scope of 10 or more employees for international comparability). Maintaining current size information in statistical business registers is generally more difficult for smaller businesses and, in many countries, businesses without employees do not follow the same registration procedures as employing businesses and so may be difficult to investigate.
257. For reasons of cost and respondent burden, most countries do not include all micro-businesses in the target population. However, the exclusion of micro-businesses from ICT usesurveys in developing economies would bias the results and should be carefully consideredfor the following reasons:
•Micro-businesses can account for a very high proportion of the total number of businesses(as high as 90 per cent or more);
•They can account for a significant share of total employment, and
•ICT enables businesses of any size, including micro-businesses (for example, in the ICTconsultancy sector), to collaborate and generate economic growth.
258. It is therefore recommended that the establishment of a threshold for the size of businesses inthe target population be based on the representativeness of the in-scope population in termsof total employment. Specific methods for investigating the micro-business segment may beneeded for official statistics (see Example 16).
259. In some countries, the legal or administrative definition of business size is based not only onthe number of employees, but also on a combination of the number of employees and theturnover (classified in intervals). Some harmonization of turnover intervals has been achievedat the regional level (for example in the EU, where the above classification of micro, small,medium and large businesses is used, in combination with common thresholds for turnover).However, given the variety of national situations and, within a country, the change over timeof appropriate interval values for turnover, it is difficult to make recommendations on thedefinition of the target population in terms of turnover. Moreover, the ratio of turnover valuesto size (number of employees) varies considerably by industry.Example 16   India: Investigating micro-business
In many developing countries, the Business Register may be outdated in relation to micro-businesses, which change more rapidly than larger ﬁrms. In India, where micro-enterprises make up the sampling frame used for the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI),the register is updated annually to record potential changes in micro-enterprises by the National Sample Survey Organisation. The sampling scheme combines a census approach for larger establishments and random sampling for the rest, including a specific strata for micro-enterprises. 
Source:   National Sample Survey Organisation, Government of India.
Note:  Although this approach has not yet been used by India in a national survey to measure ICT access and use by micro-
enterprises, a methodologically robust study on the same issue published by LIRNEAsia in 2018, considered to be 
nationally representative, has been referred to by the Ministry of Communications of India as a source of baseline data to “develop policies” (see https://lirneasia.net/after-access/india/).UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 2020104
260. In many developing countries, self-employed persons constitute an important part of the
workforce, even if their contribution to the economic value is smaller than that of incorporatedenterprises. Data on the use of ICT by self-employed can be collected through surveys ofhouseholds, rather than through surveys of businesses, since the coverage in statisticalregisters of the self-employed may not be as updated as for enterprises. It is thereforerecommended to analyze data on the use of ICT by individuals, selecting those withemployment status described as self-employed, using surveys such as those recommendedby the Manual for Measuring ICT Access and Use by Households and Individuals.
261. The third variable used to describe units of a survey on ICT use is the geographical location.The geographical scope of the business sector (and its parts) should in principle include theentire economic territory of the country. The geographical scope within a country shouldideally include both urban and rural areas. This is likely to be particularly important in countrieswhere there is an urban/rural digital divide. Rural areas of many developing economies,especially LDCs, suffer from a lack of the basic infrastructure, such as electricity and telephone lines, which are important in building a solid ICT base. Consequently, the use of ICT byrural businesses may present an important gap or even be almost non-existent. In somecountries, the presence of businesses (including unorganized manufacturing businesses) inrural areas can be of great importance. As the use of ICT spreads throughout a country, it isrecommended that rural areas be also included within the scope of ICT use surveys.
56
262. The definition of rural and urban locations has not been harmonized at the international level,and therefore comparisons are often problematic. Where there is a statistical definition forurban and rural localities in a particular country, it is generally based on the number (or density)of inhabitants. The definition of urban agglomerations (which can include localities with asmall number of inhabitants but geographically connected to larger cities) is also not unique.Therefore, in order to break down indicators by urban/rural location of the business, it isnecessary to establish a definition at the country level (see Example 17) and make it availablein the metadata so that users can compare the data across countries. Recommendationsabout the classification of localities as urban or rural can be found in the UNSD Principles and
Recommendations for Population and Housing Censuses, Revision 3 (2017)
57.
56 Clearly, indicators resulting from a survey with such scope limitations will not be representative of the entire 
country (and would be upwardly biased if they purported to be).

Recommendations/Population-and-Housing-Censuses/Series_M67rev3-E.pdf105
 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
7.1.2 Population frames and coverage
263. The population frame for a survey is the operational form of the target population and consists
of a list of all relevant statistical units. The frame is generally used to extract samples of units(such as random samples of specific sub-populations).
264. In the case of business surveys, the frame population is usually extracted from the businessregister, which lists the economic agents operating in the economy. Business registers forstatistical purposes (to be distinguished from registers for other administrative purposes) aregenerally established and maintained by NSOs and are based on both external sources (suchas tax registers) and internal ones (such as the results of ongoing ‘unit surveys’ or other unitinvestigations). Business registers are key infrastructure for a statistical system and the qualityof business statistics depends heavily on the quality of the underlying register.
265. The target population of the survey on exports of ICT-enabled service is limited to businessesexporting digitally deliverable services. The prevalence of this type of enterprises in generalbusiness register could be small, especially in developing countries. For this reason, the useof other sample frames focused on exporting is recommended for this survey. Specifically, thebalance of payments (BOP) register of services exporting firms is the recommended option,if available. Usually, the BOP register is managed by the national central bank and it includesdetails about the exporting or importing by resident enterprises. A BOP register includes notonly the basic identification variables but also key economic information regarding the natureand type of exports and imports of each business.
266. Common quality problems of business registers in terms of coverage are: duplication ofunits, over-coverage (i.e., inclusion of units that are not part of the target population) andunder-coverage (i.e., non-inclusion of units that should be part of the target population).Ideally, the frame population and the target population will be very close, though this is rare(in developed as well as developing economies). The quality of business statistics is usuallyExample 17   Europe: Deﬁnition of urban and rural areas
Since 2013, Eurostat has adopted an urban-rural typology that has a three-step approach to classify the NUTS (Nomenclature of Units for Territorial Statistics) level 3 regions. The first step is to identify populations in rural areas: ‘rural areas’ are all areas outside urban clusters. ‘Urban clusters’ are clusters of contiguous grid cells of one km² with a density of at least 300 inhabitants per km² and a minimum population of 5,000. In the second step, NUTS 3 regions are classified based on the share of their population in rural areas as:
•‘Predominantly rural’ if the share of the population living in rural areas is higher than 50.
•‘Intermediate’ if the share of the population living in rural areas is between 20 and 50.
•‘Predominantly urban’ if the share of the population living in rural areas is below 20.
To resolve the distortion created by extremely small NUTS 3 regions, for classification purposes regions smaller than 500 km² are combined with one or more of their neighbors.
In a third step, the size of the urban centres in the region is considered. A predominantly rural 
region which contains an urban centre of more than 200,000 inhabitants making up at least 25 per cent of the regional population becomes intermediate. An intermediate region which contains an urban centre of more than 500,000 inhabitants making up at least 25 per cent of the regional population becomes predominantly urban.
Source:   Eurostat, https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/rural-development/methodology UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 2020106
sensitive to the quality of the business register, which should therefore be as high as possible. 
Maintenance of the business register can occur through feedback from periodic enterprise and establishment censuses, ad hoc or regular ‘unit surveys’ to investigate over- and under-
coverage, checks of duplicates, and cross-verification against other registers – such as tax 
or administrative registers.
267. In many developing economies, the inadequacies of statistical business registers include:
•The presence of a large informal sector which is not recorded in administrative systems(such as those dealing with licenses or taxes), leading to under-coverage of the businessregister;
•Micro-businesses (including self-employed persons) may be more difficult to identify andupdate, since they usually follow different administrative procedures for registration; thiscould lead to under-coverage;
•The existence of many ‘dormant’ businesses that were originally registered but have notbeen removed from the business register when they ceased to be active (or merged withother businesses). This is due to the administrative difficulties (or lack of administrative
processes) that can be found in some countries in relation to ceasing a business; this leads
to over-coverage, and/or
•The content of the business register is not adequate for correctly classifying businesses interms of industry, size and/or location.
268. Obviously, the improvement of the statistical business register is not a task related to thecollection of digital economy indicators, but a responsibility of the entire national statisticalsystem. Usually, the best way of improving the adequacy of the business register is to
coordinate general administrative registers (related to taxes, registrations, licenses, social
security etc.), specific registers (such as licenses for operating telecommunicationsbusinesses) and statistical databases (updated from economic censuses). In countries witha well-developed tax or social security system, frames generated directly from associatedregisters could be an option if the law allows for use of registry information for this purpose.
269. In countries where there are no adequate statistical business registers, it is more difficult toconduct surveys on the digital economy. It will be necessary to consider the possibility ofconstructing a population frame from other sources such as lists of live units in economic
censuses or external directories such as commercial telephone listings or industry association
lists. Since it is unlikely that all businesses will be included in those lists, the frame may sufferfrom under-coverage, thereby producing biased estimates. It is recommended in that case tocompare the coverage of the frame with other sources and, if possible, to adjust estimatesby a process of reweighting. In addition, the necessary documentation and metadata should
be provided to inform users how the frame was constituted.
270. In order to improve the coverage of the business register for surveys on the digital economy,
countries (particularly NSOs) may use the following sources:
•Commercial directories of ICT sector associations.
•Registers of companies carrying out foreign trade operations.
•Registers of companies participating in public tenders.
•Web-scraping of business websites to obtain names, addresses and contact informationfor start-ups or established companies.107
 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
271. Countries using a population frame that lacks accurate information on industry should include
a supplementary question in the survey to classify with sufficient detail the main activity of ther
espondent unit (using ISIC or the national classification), as well as its secondary and auxiliary
activities. The same can be done to measure the size of the business. Clearly, samples basedon incomplete frames will not be as efficient in this situation (because samples cannot bestratified by industry and/or size).
7.1.3 Statistical units
272. The statistical unit of a sample survey or census is defined as the basic unit of the targetpopulation about which data are compiled. Statistical operations such as estimation,imputation (for non-r
esponse) and tabulation are carried out on statistical units. The statistical
unit may take the form of an observation unit (for which information is collected) or an analytical unit (information about which is created by statisticians).
273. Business surveys usually use enterprises or establishments (i.e., local units of enterprises)as the statistical unit but other choices ar
e possible (enterprise groups, kind-of-activity units,
etc.). The choice of the statistical unit is relevant for ICT indicators since it is probable thatlower order units (such as establishments) will have a lower intensity of ICT use. Importantly,most of the denominators used to calculate the core ICT use indicators are related to thechoice of statistical unit (proportion of enterprises or establishments) and should be welldocumented for international comparability purposes.
274. Since ICT use is not easy to attribute to the different establishments of an enterprise (thevery nature of enterprise networks implies sharing some elements of ICT infrastructure, suchas networks, between establishments), the enterprise is the statistical unit most commonlyadopted by countries that have implemented ICT surveys. It is also the unit recommendedby the Partnership and the OECD. Although there is no universally adopted definition of anenterprise (see Box 12), common criteria for defining an enterprise are autonomy of decision-making for allocation of resources, and engagement in one or more productive activities.
275. This Manual recommends that countries adopt the SNA 08 concept of enterprise, in whichan enterprise has some degree of autonomy in decision-making and consists of one or morelegal units involved in one or more activities at one or more locations. The definition of anenterprise according to the SNA 08 methodology is “an institutional unit as a producer ofgoods and services” that could be a corporation or an unincorporated enterprise. In somecountries, the fact that (registered) legal units must submit certain financial reports to anadministrative or fiscal authority is seen as an operational criterion for determining autonomyof decision-making. In addition, the sharing of production factors (buildings, capital goods,employees and management) is a strong indication for combining legal units into oneenterprise unit. In developing countries, adopting the SNA 08 definition may broaden thescope of ICT indicators to include the informal sector. The definition used should in all casesbe clearly stated in the metadata.
276. The definition of the enterprise as the appropriate statistical unit poses some limitations inrelation to geographical breakdown. Many enterprises, especially larger ones, will consistof several establishments. Because of this, a geographical breakdown of the results usingthe location of the main headquarters of the enterprise may be of limited use. An economicactivity breakdown may also be problematic for enterprise units engaged in more than onetype of industrial activity.UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 2020108
277. In practice, the preferred statistical unit may not be able to provide data for a survey. In such
a case, a reporting unit could be defined as a unit that reports to the survey authority andprovides data for the statistical unit (if possible) or otherwise the most practicable alternativeunit. An example is where the objective of the survey is to collect data at the establishmentlevel (which is therefore the statistical unit) but the parent enterprise (the ‘reporting unit’ in thiscase) provides data for each of its establishments. The alternative of using establishmentsor enterprises as the statistical unit is relevant for firms with multiple locations, and for largefirms. Usually, large firms constitute a stratum that is investigated exhaustively (that is, withoutsampling). In that case, the enterprise may provide information on all its establishments.
278. The choice of statistical units for ICT surveys will depend on organizational considerationssuch as the availability and detail of business registers (whether it consists of establishmentsor enterprises), the data collection method, and the business sector environment (businesslegislation, prevalence of small businesses and other considerations based on the country’seconomic and administrative environment). In developing economies, where the share ofmicro and small enterprises is high, it may be convenient to collect data at the establishmentlevel, because establishments and enterprises will generally be equivalent (large firms may beinvestigated exhaustively). Survey metadata need to specify information about the statisticalunit chosen.Box 12  SNA 08 and Eurostat definition of an enterprise
In the framework of ISIC,BOJOTUJUVUJPOBMVOJUJOJUTDBQBDJUZBTas a producer of goods and 
servicesJTLOPXOBTBOFOUFSQSJTF. An enterprise is an economic transactor with autonomy in 
respect of financial and investment decision-making, as well as authority and responsibility for 
allocating resources to produce goods and services. It may be engaged in one or many 
productive activities. The enterprise is the level of statistical unit at which all information relating 
to its transactions, including financial and balance-sheet accounts, are maintained, and from 
which international transactions, an international investment position (when applicable), 
consolidated financial position and net worth can be derived
According to the SNA 08, an enterprise is “an institutional unit as a producer of goods and 
services. The term enterprise may refer to a corporation, a quasi-corporation, a non-profit 
institution, or an unincorporated enterprise. An unincorporated enterprise represents the 
production activity of a government unit, non-profit institution serving households  or household 
that cannot be treated as the production activity of a quasi-corporation.”
The definition used by the European Commission of an enterprise is “an organizational unit 
producing goods or services which has a certain degree of autonomy in decision-making. An 
enterprise can carry out more than one economic activity and it can be situated at more than 
one location. An enterprise may consist out of one or more legal units.”

 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
7.1.4 Sample design
279. Stand-alone surveys on ICT use by businesses are usually designed to collect information
on many topics from businesses across a wide range of industries. For cost and respondentburden reasons, countries will usually wish to select a representative sample of the populationof businesses. A complete enumeration of in-scope businesses would usually only be feasibleif the number of businesses were small. This could occur, for instance, if the incidence of ICTuse in the country were very low (and both ICT and non-ICT using businesses could beidentified), or if a high size cut-off were used, thus limiting the scope to large businesses.From this point, we will assume that neither of these situations applies and that countries willbe using samples of their population rather than selecting all units.
280. In order to guarantee the representativeness of a sample selection, it should be made usingprobabilistic techniques. Only probabilistic (random) sampling allows calculation of estimatesof the sampling error (also known as ‘sample error’), which is defined as the deviation fromthe true value attributable to the fact that only a sample of the population was observed.The design of a random sample should be based on considerations of the structure of thepopulation of businesses (its stratification), the cost of collecting data and the maximumacceptable statistical error associated with estimates.
281. In the case of modules on ICT use or exports of ICT-enabled services embedded in othersurvey vehicles, data may be collected from all selected units or only a portion of them. Ineither case, the design of the survey vehicle will influence the quality of digital economystatistics. Comments and recommendations in this Manual will have to be adapted to thesurvey vehicle design.
7.1.5 Stratification of the population
282. Stratification is the technique of dividing the business sector into relatively homogeneousgroups (called strata) for the purposes of sample design and estimation. If done properly,stratification will minimize the sample variance of estimates for a given sample size. It allowsthe use of different sampling ratios (the number of selected businesses divided by the totalnumber of businesses) across strata, reflecting characteristics such as their size, importanceor homogeneity.
283. Optimal stratification strategies are based on variables closely related to the variables that arebeing measured. For the measurement of ICT use in the business sector, the experience ofstatistical offices of OECD countries shows that at least two criteria are useful for stratification:economic activity and size of business (in terms of number of employees). Use of thesestratification variables will generally reduce the overall variance of estimates, as well asdisaggregation of ICT use statistics by industry and size.
284. A third stratification variable sometimes used is the geographical location of the business.58
This is especially important if it is anticipated that some areas of the country (such as thecapital) have a different intensity of ICT use than other areas. In large countries or countries with a strong regional structure (such as federal states), strata that can also be defined accordingto the region or to the political-administrative organization; in practice, it is equivalent todesigning independent samples in each region. Where location is used for stratification (oras an output classification), the way the location of businesses is determined is important.For example, if the statistical unit is the enterprise and it has several locations correspondingto geographically distributed establishments, the criteria for determining location of theenterprise need to be established. In OECD countries, the location will usually be the addressof the head office, or equivalent.
58 Countries with a strong r egional structure (such as federal states) may establish region as a stratification 
variable. In practical means, it is equivalent to designing independent samples in each region.UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 2020110
285. It is recommended that the design of a sample to collect ICT use statistics consider at least
the stratification of the business sector according to industry and business size.
7.1.6 Sample size
286. The sample size, that is, the number of statistical units from (or about) which information isto be collected, is calculated according to the stratification of the population of businessesfor which estimates are to be calculated. If the tabulation plan includes dissemination of data
by industry, size and/or location, the sample size will need to be sufficiently large such that
disaggregated data estimates have an acceptable level of sampling error.
287. It will be necessary to balance the required precision (reflecting the size of sampling error) ofestimates with available resources (see Box 13). A large sample size involves higher costs fordata collection. For a given stratum, doubling the precision (i.e., halving the sampling error)
for an estimate of a proportion requires multiplying the sampling size in that stratum by four.
Box 13  Sample size and sampling err or
A critical fact in random sample design is that, given the bound of sampling error at a given 
confidence level acceptable in each stratum, the sample size required to keep the error under this bound does not grow proportionally to the number of enterprises in the stratum, as shown in the 
following figure:
Sample size 
(sampling error 5% with a confidence level of 95%)
Number of enterprises
For instance, let us consider an upper bound for a sampling error of 5 per cent at a confidence 
level of 95%. If there are 100 enterprises in a stratum, the sample size required to guarantee this 
accuracy level will be 80 enterprises. The required sample size increases to 285 enterprises if the 
total number of enterprises in the stratum is 1,000, and to 381 if the number in the stratum is 
50,000. As shown in the graph above, sample size is almost constant for strata larger than 5,000 
enterprises. Moreove r, no matter how large a stratum is, a sample size of 381 will guarantee the 
required accuracy level. Based on these considerations, a standard sampling practice is to 
select a maximum number of enterprises (381) for a stratum, independently of their size.Sample size111
 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
288. The sample size and design are derived using bottom-up procedures that calculate the 
minimum sample size such that output estimates for the most important variables have a 
specified maximum sampling error. Estimates of the sampling error for these variables may be 
used to design the sample and may be based on previous surveys or pilot tests. For example, 
if the reception of online orders is used as a qualitative variable to allocate the sample, strata 
with very high or very low proportions of businesses receiving online orders will be surveyed 
less intensively than businesses with a proportion close to 50 per cent, in accordance with 
sampling theory.
289. There are no international recommendations for the precision to be achieved for ICT indicators. 
The precision is usually expressed in terms of the coefficient of variation (i.e., the standard 
deviation divided by the value of the estimate, usually expressed as a percentage).
290. The final sample size will be the sum of individual strata samples. If the total size is too 
large, it may be necessary to reconsider the errors of some of the population groups, and to 
recalculate the total size. The usual approach to setting the precision required for estimates 
is to fix a maximum sample error for one-dimensional breakdowns of indicators and higher 
sampling errors for two-dimensional breakdowns. Eurostat recommendations that member 
States specify a maximum coefficient of variation for overall proportions of 2 per cent and 5 
per cent for proportions relating to different sub-groups of the business population, where 
these sub-groups constitute at least 5 per cent of the total population in the scope of the 
survey.
291. A sample survey can be designed to provide a maximum statistical error of, say 5 per cent, 
for the total number of employees for sections of ISIC, while accepting statistical errors up to 
10 per cent for the two-dimensional breakdown of ISIC section by business size interval. The 
sample will be smaller than that required for a maximum statistical error of 5 per cent for both 
one- and two- dimensional breakdowns.
292. A top-down procedure that is sometimes useful is to calculate the maximum sample size 
based on the available budget for the survey and the unit cost for collecting data from one 
business, and then allocate (distribute) the sample by strata according to some operational 
rule. The Neyman allocation (based on the cost and the variance of variables in each stratum), 
for example, guarantees that overall error is minimized.
293. These methods may be modified to adapt them to the survey requirements. Some of the 
most frequently applied modifications used are: 1) to fix minimum sizes to some strata, with 
the objective of calculating estimates with a minimum precision; 2) to completely enumerate 
some important strata (such as those containing large businesses); or 3) to select a larger 
sample than optimal, to anticipate the reduction of the effective sample caused by non-
response.
294. It is important to note that, irrespective of sample size, a high non-response rate means that 
the calculated estimates are likely to be biased, and that bias will increase with the non-
response rate if non-respondent businesses differ significantly from respondent ones (it is 
likely that businesses that have responded use ICT more intensively than those which have 
failed to respond). Therefore, one of the important goals of the survey is to minimize the non-
response rate (note that the non-response rate does not give complete information about the 
bias of estimations).UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 2020112
7.1.7 Sample selection methods
295. Assuming that the population is stratified as described above, it is important to consider how 
to select samples within strata. Two of the simplest and most used methods are systematic 
sampling and simple random sampling. They are described in Box 14 below.
296. Systematic and random sampling can be combined to optimize the available sampling 
economic and human resources. For instance, an efficient sampling strategy could be 
to divide the whole sample frame into three tiers based on size intervals, an exhaustively 
sampled tier for the largest units, for which the sample ratio would hence be 100 per cent; 
a sampling tier, with a sample ratio to be defined according to the number of units in this 
segment and the management capacities of the national institution in charge of implementing 
the survey; and an uncovered tier including small and very small businesses which could be 
left aside the regular implementation of the survey. This does not mean that small and very 
small business are not relevant, but that countries with limited resources may prioritize the 
statistical research on larger enterprises.
297. It is important to note that the method used for sample selection must correspond with the 
method of estimation. Thus, if it is considered appropriate to select businesses in a given 
stratum with unequal probabilities (e.g., proportional to their size), the estimates will have to 
weigh the units by a weight that is the reciprocal of those probabilities in their formula.Box 14 Sample selection methods
Systematic sampling
The simplest method for random selection of businesses is systematic sampling. Units in the 
stratum must be arranged from 1 to N, where N is the number of units in the stratum. If n is the 
number of units to be selected, an interval K should be calculated, such that K=N/n (ignoring the 
remainder). Now, a random number (the starting point) between 1 and K is selected, call it t, and 
the sample will consist of the units t, t+K, t+2K, etc. This method can generate sample sizes of 
n or n+1, which means that the estimate will be biased, unless the weighting factor is adjusted 
to reflect the larger sample. The systematic sampling method allows distribution of the sample 
among the population of firms, by means of introducing some order in the frame. For example, if 
in each stratum companies are ordered by geographic code, the systematic sample will gather 
representative elements of all the localities.
Simple random sampling
Random sampling can be thought of as randomly drawing n numbers between 1 and N, where 
units in the stratum that correspond to those numbers will be included in the sample. Random 
numbers can be generated by means of randomization routines present in most statistical 
software. Another possibility is to use a fixed table of random numbers, but this procedure will 
be cumbersome. Usually selection will be without replacement, that is, there is no possibility of 
selecting the same unit more than once.113
 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
7.2 - Data processing
298. The numerical processes that take place after data collection and before aggregate information 
is disseminated include data editing and data weighting. These processes are included in 
phase 5 (“process”) of the GSBPM. Data processing practices are country-specific because 
data producers will usually have defined them for other business surveys. When ICT surveys 
are embedded into existing business surveys, data processing for ICT-related variables will 
tend to follow that of the vehicle survey, with the addition of edits that are specific to ICT 
questions.
7.2.1 Data editing
299. For many reasons, statistical information provided by businesses, whatever the instrument 
of data capture, can contain errors. These include erroneous or missing data, incorrect 
classifications, and inconsistent or illogical responses. In order to minimize such errors, it is 
important to apply techniques which optimize the effectiveness of data capture instruments 
and collection procedures. In addition, robust data editing techniques should be used to 
transform raw data provided by respondents into valid and coherent (‘clean’) data that can 
be used to produce aggregated statistics.
300. In this Manual , the term “editing” is used to cover all the phases of data processing, from the 
inspection of raw information provided by the respondent to the production of a clean data 
set from which aggregates are generated. Data editing covers the sub-processes referred 
to as ‘micro-editing’ and ‘macro-editing’ (also sometimes referred to as ‘input’ and ‘output’ 
editing, see Figure 7):
• Micro-editing  refers to controls, validations and modifications applied to the data of a 
given business. The process includes the treatment of incomplete or missing data and the 
detection and treatment of answers that are inconsistent with other questions, and
• Macro-editing  refers to controls, validations and modifications of whole datasets by 
means of the analysis of aggregations. The aim of the process is to check whether certain 
estimates are jointly compatible and are consistent with other knowledge. A sophisticated 
macro-editing procedure consists of readjusting sample weights according to frame errors 
detected during the survey. This point is elaborated later in this chapter.UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 2020114
301. Data editing is especially critical for data that are not collected by surveys but acquired from 
pre-existing sources, especially big data sources (e.g., by web-scraping companies’ websites 
to obtain statistics on e-commerce functionalities). Commonly, big data are not the result of 
a controlled data collection and dissemination process, but just a trace of digital actives that 
have been recorded with no statistical quality control. Rigorous quality assessment to identify 
potential issues and editing procedures to improve such quality (including harmonization, 
classification according to international standards, data enrichment and data imputation) are 
in general required for big data sources as a first step for its application in the measurement 
of the digital economy.
7.2.2 Treatment of internal inconsistencies and errors
302. Data editing involves checking and often manipulation of the original data. Such processes 
can introduce errors that affect aggregate data. Thus, although the process of data editing 
is essential, it is very important that practices be established that decrease the incidence 
of incomplete or inconsistent data, so that the impact of data editing is minimized. Quality 
controls already embedded in data collection instruments or at the data entry stage will 
directly improve the quality of raw data and reduce the task of data processing.
303. The choice of collection instrument has a direct impact on data quality. Both computer-
assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) and computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) 
can be expected to improve the quality of input data since they provide automatic controls for 
detecting response errors. Paper questionnaires require validation by statistical staff before 
and/or after data are entered into a computer for further processing.
304. Validity control of an individual data item consists of checking if the answer belongs to 
a predefined set (or range) of valid responses. In order to check questions for validity, it 
is necessary to check them against those defined valid responses. To check the internal 
consistency of a questionnaire, it is necessary to establish and apply rules that define 
the relationships between questions, so that certain answers restrict the valid values that Raw data

other questions can accept (see Box 15). Arithmetic checks (for instance, that percentage 
distributions add to 100) may be applied during data entry or later run in batch mode across 
a set of records.
7.2.3 Treatment of missing data
305. Unit non-response refers to the failure to collect any information from some survey units. 
Item non-response refers to missing data in a returned questionnaire. Since both forms of 
non-response have the potential to introduce bias, data collection agencies should strive to 
reduce the extent of non-response, by means of advertising the survey to data providers 
through the best available media, improved questionnaires, high-quality fieldwork (if used) 
and good non-response follow up. However, even with such controls, a certain level of non-
response is unavoidable. Analysis of patterns of non-response in relation to the type of unit 
(e.g., micro-businesses) or questions may enable improvement in data collection tools and 
procedures. Improvements include modification of question wording or instructions, and 
introduction of simplified questionnaires for some businesses (e.g., micro-businesses).
7.2.4 Unit non-response
306. The usual statistical practice for correcting unit non-response is to change weights in order 
to compensate for non-responding units. Two methods are possible: sample-based and 
population-based (see Box 16).
• Sample-based corrective weighting consists of modifying the original sample weights by 
multiplying them by the inverse of the non-response rate in each affected stratum (or 
segment); and
• Population-based corrective weighting is equivalent to classical post-stratification in which 
survey data are benchmarked against known population totals. This method will also 
correct poor frame coverage if the benchmarks are independent of the population frame.Box 15 Application of micro-editing rules
The question “How many employees use the Internet?” should only be answered if the business 
has declared in a previous question that it has used the Internet. In logical terms, the question on 
the business’ use of the Internet can only take two values (0=No or 1=Yes, for example). If the 
answer is No, then the second question on the number of employees using the Internet should 
not be answered by the respondent. If the answer to the business Internet use question is Yes, 
the question on employees’ use can only be answered with a numerical value that is more than 
zero but less than or equal to the number of employees of the business. (Please also recall the 
discussion earlier about the definition of ‘employees’ including employed persons such as owners.)UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 2020116
307. It is important to recall that the hypothesis underlying both treatments for unit non-response 
is that businesses that do not answer are well represented, within the same homogeneous 
segment (or stratum), by those that do. When there is a risk that non-response is correlated 
with the variables of interest, neither method will remove the inherent non-response bias.
308. There are more sophisticated methods to correct the weights, based on econometric models 
(logit, probit and log-linear models). However, they will not be discussed in this Manual.
7.2.5 Item non-response
309. The difference between item non-response and unit non-response is not always clear. In 
particular, if a business has failed to answer many questions, including some important items, 
it may be more effective from an operational viewpoint to treat that business as a unit non-
response, instead of imputing estimates for a large number of item non-responses.Box 16 Corrective weighting for unit non-response
Recalculation of sample weights for unit non-response
A simple example of computation of sample-based non-response weights is presented in the 
following table. Suppose we have an ICT survey of 200 enterprises selected with simple random 
sampling out of 100,000 units, broken down in segments that are considered homogeneous in 
respect of non-response (in a stratified random sample, the segments would usually be strata). In 
order to account for unit non-response, design weights must be modified as shown below. 
The impact of non-response
A sample of 1,000 businesses selected from a population is formed by two groups of equal size, 
but with different proportions of Internet use. Group A has 70 per cent and group B has 10 per 
cent (so 40 per cent of businesses in the whole sample use the Internet). The following table shows 
the impact on the estimate of Internet access, due to different non-response rates in each group.
Now, the sample estimate of the proportion is 336/1,000=33.6%, which has a bias of 6.4% (that is, 
40 – 33.6). If the hypothesis of homogeneous non-response ratio fails, the mechanical application 
of non-response weights leads to biased estimates.Enterprises Weights

 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
310. Item non-response is generally caused by one of the following: 
• The respondent refuses to answer a question (possibly because the information sought 
is sensitive);
• The respondent does not know the answer (for instance, the information may not be 
available from business records);
• The respondent misunderstands the question and so does not attempt to answer it; and/
or
• The respondent has unintentionally omitted an answer (possibly because the questionnaire 
has been poorly designed with confusing wording or unclear logic).
311. In the case of more technical ICT questions (such as type of Internet access), non-response 
may be decreased if it is specified that a person with ICT knowledge (e.g., the chief information 
officer) should respond for the business.
312. Ignoring missing answers can lead to statistically biased estimates, because these are 
calculated from an unrepresentative part of the sample. Following up item non-response is 
an obvious solution, especially in cases where the item non-response is extensive, the unit 
is significant or important questions have been omitted (e.g., those pertaining to the core 
ICT indicators). Obtaining responses may be easier where the collection is legally mandatory 
and, in any case, should be carried out as soon as possible after the incomplete response 
is received.
313. Where it is impractical to re-contact respondents, missing data could be estimated (imputed). 
Mathematical procedures for imputing missing data are described in Annex 7.
7.2.6 Treatment of misclassified units
314. A frequent problem affecting the quality of business statistics is that some responding 
businesses may be initially included in the wrong stratum in the population frame from 
which the sample is drawn. This is more likely when the frame (and the underlying business 
register) is of poor quality. Statistical business registers maintained by NSOs usually contain 
information on size (usually in terms of number of employees and/or turnover), industry and 
location (based on business address). Since ICT indicators are usually broken down by these 
classification variables, it is important to correct misclassified units.
315. Once the scope (target population) for a survey on ICT in business is defined, a list of ‘eligible’ 
(‘in-scope’) businesses for investigation must be put together in order to create a population 
frame. It is possible that misclassified units are erroneously included as eligible, and that 
eligible units are misclassified such that they do not appear on the frame or appear in the 
wrong stratum. In the first case, if a surveyed business is eliminated from the sample because 
of non-eligibility, this will reduce the effective sample size unless a reserve list is prepared. 
Elimination of misclassified units should only be considered if the rate of misclassification is 
small. 
316. In the second case, the unit is eligible, but was included in the wrong stratum or omitted 
from the frame altogether. For example, a business selected in the size interval (stratum) 
of 10 to 20 employees, may report that, in fact, it has only eight employees. The technical 
solution consists of recalculating sample weights. A new estimate of the size of strata must 
be produced and weights corrected accordingly (see Box 17). Clearly, the establishment and 
maintenance of an up-to-date business register from which to draw a reliable population 
frame is of utmost importance.UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 2020118
7.2.7 Weighting procedures
317. ICT indicators are generally referred to the whole business sector or to a relevant part of it. 
If only a sample of businesses is surveyed, the data collected must be weighted in order 
to obtain estimates in respect to the target population. The procedure by which sample 
data become population estimates is called ‘weighting’ (or ‘grossing-up’). The weighting 
mechanism must be consistent with the design of the sample. Therefore, weights cannot be 
applied in these cases where the coverage of a source or the rules for data collection are not 
known, as is common for big data sources or convenience sampling.
318. When the survey is a census - that is, data are collected from all units - there is no need for 
sample weighting. However , as discussed earlier , censuses are generally expensive and less 
efficient than sample surveys. Although there are exceptions to this, for example if the country 
has a population frame that identifies all users of computers, and there is a manageable 
number of such businesses, they could be completely enumerated.
319. In line with international recommendations for business statistics, surveys on ICT use by 
businesses are generally based on a stratified random sample design, with strata defined 
by industry and size (at least). Businesses should be selected at random from strata (except 
for those that are completely enumerated, e.g., large business strata). It is assumed that the 
sample design is based on random selection, without replacement, within strata. Stratum 
estimates are therefore calculated based on a simple expansion (weighting) to the totalBox 17  How to tr eat misclassification
Assume that the business population is stratified into two strata (say urban and rural according 
to their location), and that the population frame includes 1,000 businesses classified as rural and 2,000 as urban. A sample size of 10 businesses is extracted from each stratum, giving a priori 
sample weights equal to w
rural= 1,000/10 = 100 and wurban= 2,000/10 = 200. Suppose that after 
data collection, the following ex post classification of sample data is as follows:
The table indicates that, out of the 10 businesses that were selected from stratum 1, in fact 3 
belonged to stratum 2. A corrected estimate of the total number of rural businesses is:
1,000 × 7/10 + 2,000 × 1/10 = 900;
and an estimate of the total number of urban businesses is:
1,000 × 3/10 + 2,000 × 9/10 = 2,100.
Accordingly, the new sample weights for the rural and urban businesses will be w’rural = 900/10 = 90  
and w’urban = 2,100/10 = 210.Stratum 1     Stratum 2

 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
number of businesses in the stratum. The method also applies if the selection is systematic 
with a random starting point in each stratum. The method explained below can be applied to both qualitative variables (such as the presence of a website) and quantitative variables (such 
as the number of employees who used the Internet).
In the case of quantitative variables, let y
hi be the value of the variable, y, for business i in 
stratum h (for example, the number of employees with access to Internet). For qualitative 
variables, yhi will be 1 if the business has a particular characteristic (for example, if it has a 
website) and 0 otherwise. The sample average in stratum h is defined as the sum of all the sample values in the stratum divided by the number of sampled businesses, say nh, i.e.,
ynh1yh hi
i1nh
=
=/
320. If the variables are qualitative and coded as 0 or 1, the answer will represent the sample proportion of businesses with the investigated characteristic. Following the examples, yh would be the estimated average number of employees with access to the Internet in stratum 
h or the proportion of businesses with a website in stratum h.
321. The estimate for stratum h is calculated by multiplying the stratum average, yh, by the total 
number of businesses in the stratum (procedure also referred to as the Horvitz-Thompson 
estimator), i.e.,
y'nNyN y h

322. See Box 18 for the calculation of stratum estimates. It should be noted that stratum 
estimates will generally be further aggregated for dissemination purposes. For example, the stratification variable for industry may be at the 4-digit (class) level but this level is too detailed 
for dissemination (which might be at the 1 or 2-digit level).
Box 18  How to make a stratified estimate for an ICT indicator
A survey on ICT use in the manufacturing sector has been stratified according to size with two 
strata: ‘0 to 19 employees’ and ‘20 or more employees’. The sizes of the strata are 50,000 and 
4,000 businesses respectively. A survey with a sample of 500 and 1,000 businesses in each 
stratum respectively provides the following non-weighted sample data on the question “Does your business use computers?”
Business that use computers:
0 to 19 employees  125  (out of 500 selected)
20 or more employees  750  (out of 1000 selected)
The stratum estimates for the number of businesses with a computer are given by (50,000/500) 
× 125 = 12,500 and (4,000/1,000) × 750 = 3,000 (i.e., stratum weights multiplied by stratum estimates of the number of businesses using computers). Note that the weights are the inverse of 
the sampling rate.UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 2020120
323. The population total of the variable of interest is estimated by addition of the estimates for 
each stratum, i.e., Y’1+Y’2+Y’3+… +Y’L, where L is the number of strata (see Box 19). When 
estimates are generated by means of standard statistical software, weights equivalent to  
Nh/nh are assigned to each unit in the sample. The formula for the estimate for stratum h 
(given above) can be written in the following way to show the assignment of weights to each 
unit:
y'nNynNy h
hh
hi
i1n
hh

324. Weighting procedures for producing estimates that combine qualitative and quantitative 
variables are also possible. For example, to estimate the number of employees  (quantitative) 
who work in businesses that sell via the Internet (qualitative), it is possible to proceed in the 
following way: let yhi be the number of employees in business i of stratum h that sells via 
the Internet (its value is zero for businesses which do not sell via the Internet). The sum of 
all values yhi in the stratum, multiplied by Nh/nh is an estimate of the desired stratum value. 
This weighting procedure allows calculation of estimates for totals, but also for proportions, 
percentages and ratios.
325. The calculation of sample weights is a key step in data processing and should be carefully 
implemented and documented. Procedures for weighting data will depend ex ante on a 
country’s business statistical system including quality of the business register, definition 
of strata in the business sector and sampling practices (e.g., whether some strata are Box 19 How to make a stratified estimate with an exhaustive and a sampled stratum
The survey on ICT use in business conducted in a particular country was stratified with two strata, 
one exhaustive (businesses with 20 or more employees) and the other sampled with a sampling 
fraction of 5 per cent (businesses with fewer than 20 employees).
Using information in the table below, the number of businesses having a website in the total 
business sector is estimated by weighting each business with fewer than 20 employees in the 
sample by 1/0.05 = 20 and each business with 20 or more employees by 1. The population total 
is estimated by:

exhaustively sampled). Ex post,  once the data collection is carried out, the weights should be 
revised according to misclassification and non-response.
7.2.8 Calculation of ICT indicators expressed as proportions
326. Core indicators B1 to B12 on the use of ICT by businesses are expressed as proportions of 
businesses or employees that have a particular characteristic (e.g., they use computers). The 
core indicators can be estimated from samples of businesses following the steps described 
above (weighting the data from a ‘clean’ data file, obtained by editing collected data). The 
technicalities of the calculation of weights depend on the design of the sample including 
sampling fractions in each stratum.
327. Core indicators on trade in ICT goods (ICT1, ICT2, ICT3, ICT4), in ICT services (ICT5, ICT6) 
and in ICT-enabled services (ICT7, ICT8) are not expressed as proportions of businesses 
but as ratios of an estimated total over another estimated (or known) total. The weighting 
procedure to estimate ratios for stratified sampling is described in Box 20 and presented in 
further detail in Annex 7.
Box 20 Formula for estimating a ratio
To estimate the percentage of employees in businesses that sell via the Internet, out of the total 
number of employees in the business sector, it can be verified that the procedure for weighting 
each unit (as described above) is equivalent to estimating the number of employees in businesses 
that sell via the Internet, the total number of employees in the business sector, and their ratio. Let 
yhi be the number of employees in business i of stratum h, if that business sells via the Internet (its 
value is 0 otherwise) and let xhi be the number of employees in business i of stratum h. L is the 
number of strata. The estimate can be written in the following way:

Chapter 8 – Dissemination
328. This chapter describes the statistical dissemination phase. As shown in the presentation of the 
GSBPM in Section 5.1, this phase takes place once estimates for ICT indicators have beenproduced. Dissemination activities consist of preparation and distribution of ICT data and
associated metadata (meaning ‘data about data’). While numerical information is commonly
presented as a set of predefined or tailored tables or graphical elements, metadata usuallytakes the form of notes to tables and technical reports on data quality. This chapter describestabulation plans for the presentation of survey results and discusses the related metadata,both at the indicator and survey level.
329. Statistical offices aim to produce statistics that are useful for decision-making and animportant aspect of data usability is provision of associated metadata. This is especiallyimportant for ICT statistics, given the high level of interest in internationally comparable ICT
indicators (for instance, from international conferences such as the WSIS). Agencies that
produce and disseminate ICT indicators should therefore enhance their usability by routinelydisclosing associated metadata. It is strongly recommended that production of these reportsis integrated into the statistical production process and not undertaken as a separate activity.Related institutional issues are discussed in Chapter 9.
330. Various NSOs and international bodies have defined quality frameworks and reports forstatistical output. These constitute useful guidelines for determining the metadata thatshould be disseminated with ICT data. NSOs that have done work in this area include the
US Bureau of the Census and the statistical offices of Australia,
59 Canada and Sweden.
International efforts include the IMF’s Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF)60 and
Eurostat’s European Statistics Code of Practice.61 The Eurostat effort is well documented and
can be used to specify appropriate quality information about ICT use indicators according
to six quality dimensions: relevance, accuracy, timeliness and punctuality, accessibility and
clarity, comparability, and coherence. Between them, the six dimensions cover the range of
metadata that result from statistical collection work.
331. Experience suggests that quality reports are best prepared by the same unit that produces the statistical indicators. Some NSOs may have a quality control system that includes standarddocumentation of all statistical products. Quality reports are needed to improve statistical
operations and, for that reason, should be actively used by NSO staff (for instance, as part of
an approval process for the release of statistics). At the same time, an adapted version of thereport may be prepared for external users and made available along with statistical output.
8.1 - Tabulation plan
332. The presentation of survey results by NSOs most frequently takes the form of a pre-definedset of tables that are released as paper or electronic publications (‘static dissemination’).Users may also request tailored tabulations, which the NSO will prepare for them (often
for a fee). Some NSOs have gone further and have adopted web-based technology that

 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
allows users to specify the tabulation to be displayed (‘dynamic dissemination’). This form of 
dissemination is beyond the scope of this Manual.62
333. Dissemination activities are usually complemented with other communication activities byNSOs, addressing the general population or specific groups of data users (such as decision-makers or the media). These activities target providing information about the range ofstatistical products, increasing statistical literacy or trust in statistical institutions. They will notbe discussed in this Manual, since their scope is larger than ICT statistics. Good practices in
dissemination and communication have been identified for example, by the United NationsStatistics Division.
63
334. Statistical information can also be presented using visual elements. Data visualization aims toaid users in exploring, understanding, and analyzing data through iterative visual exploration.With the development of user-friendly and powerful IT tools for data visualization, datavisualization is spreading in a variety of applications. Although official statistics are not anexception to this trend, data visualization has not been leveraged to its full potential in thisdomain. Many developing country NSOs still disseminate data only in the form of numericaltables, limiting the comprehension of the results to less “statistically literate” audiences. Goodpractices in official statistical visualization are available from some international organizations(see e.g., the UNECE suite on “Making Data Meaningful”).
64
335. The set of statistical tables to be disseminated must consider the reliability of figures that willbe released. Increasing the number and detail of table cells (for example, as a result of cross-tabulation by industry and business size, which can deliver small absolute figures due to asmall sample size, or in the case of small economies with a reduced number of enterprisesin specific strata) will decrease the precision of figures displayed, since the effective samplesize on which cell estimates are based are lower. Confidentiality problems can also arise ifthe number of businesses contributing to a statistical aggregate displayed in one table cell issmall (see Box 21).
62 For an example of this kind of web-based application, several examples are available from developed and 
developing economies. For instance, the Eurostat database organized by subject matter (available at https://
ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database/), or the online dissemination systems for population census data implemented by the Statistical Office of Colombia (http://200.21.49.233/Tot_censo05/inicio_col.htm).

fileadmin/DAM/stats/documents/writing/MDM_Part2_English.pdf).UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 2020124
336. In each table cell, statistical estimates can be presented as absolute figures ( number of
businesses using computers, number of businesses using the Internet,  etc.) or as proportions
(proportion of businesses using computers, proportion of businesses using the Internet,  etc.).
In the latter case, it is important that the table title specifies the reference population (that
is, whether the reference population is the total number of in-scope businesses or the totalnumber of in-scope business that use the Internet) and that the value of denominators usedis also made available.
337. A basic tabulation plan of ICT indicators in the business sector would consider the coreindicators and the main breakdowns suggested by the Partnership, that is, business size andindustry. This basic tabulation plan would consist of at least 24 tables (the 12 core indicators,each broken down by size and industry). Further cross-tabulation by industry and size canbe of interest for many countries (should the sample size allow for sufficient accuracy ofestimates). The breakdown by urban/rural location of the business is very much dependenton the availability of good classificatory data. As discussed earlier, such a breakdown isencouraged where feasible.
338. It is important that output data include some indication of the reliability of data in tablecells. This is especially important for countries that base the production of ICT indicatorson surveys whose sample size is small. It is recommended that figures with a low level ofprecision be highlighted (for instance, those that have a coefficient of variation higher than 20per cent). Countries may set different reliability levels for different sectors or size categories(for example, allowing more sample error for the small enterprises than for larger enterprises).
339. For international dissemination purposes, UNCTAD recommends a breakdown for the sizeand industry classification variables (based on ISIC Rev. 4) as shown in Box 22. 
65
65 A breakdown based on ISIC Rev. 4 is pending further consultation with countries that have implemented or are 
in the process of adopting that classification. ISIC Rev. 4 was released in August 2008 and correspondence 
tables with ISIC Rev 3.1 can be found in the UNSD website at https://unstats.un.org/unsd/classifications/
Econ/ISIC.cshtmlBox 21  Statistical disclosure control rules
In order to decide which cells may be published, some NSOs use a minimum of three contributors 
as the threshold for the number of businesses that contribute to a cell total. 
Other rules for protecting confidentiality are defined in terms of the value that is contributed by each 
unit in the cell. For instance, a tabulation cell may be ‘sensitive’ and therefore not published if the contribution of one unit is greater than 80 per cent of the total value. This is especially important for developing economies where there are industries with a small number of competing businesses (for instance, in the telecommunications and energy sectors where very large businesses may be dominant in terms of value).
Possibilities for preventing the disclosure of confidential data include collapsing rows and/or 
columns, suppressing data (and indicating that data are not available for confidentiality reasons) and more technical approaches (such as microdata alteration), which will not be discussed here.125

8.2 - Dissemination of metadata at the indicator level
341. Some quality dimensions of statistical products are related to indicators (such as accuracy, 
reference date and scope) and others to the whole survey. This section covers indicator level 
metadata.
8.2.1 Accuracy and precision
342. Accuracy refers to the degree to which an estimate correctly describes the phenomenon 
it was designed to measure. It covers both sampling error and non-sampling error (bias). 
Precision is related only to the sampling error and may be measured by the standard error 
of an estimate (the higher the standard error, the lower the precision). Agencies compiling 
ICT indicators should publish the precision of published estimates as well as the formulas 
used to calculate precision. Note that non-sampling error, such as measurement errors 
given by unprecise wording of the items in a questionnaire or uncontrolled deviations from 
the sampling instructions, the other element of statistical error, is usually not measurable. 
However, possible sources of bias should be described, along with efforts to minimize it.
8.2.2 Sampling error
343. As we have seen, sampling error arises as a result of obtaining an estimate based on a 
sample. Most ICT indicators are expressed as proportions. In order to calculate the variance 
of the estimates, formulas shown in Annex 6 can be applied. Alternatively, the precision of an 
estimate can be indicated by the standard error (the square root of the sampling variance), 
the coefficient of variation or a confidence interval (see Box 23). The coefficient of variation 
(CV) is the ratio of the standard error to the expected value of the estimate to which it refers; 
it is usually expressed as a percentage. For proportions, the coefficient of variation may be a 
more easily understood measure of precision.
Box 23 Expressions for the precision of an indicator
If an estimate Yt has a standard error ()SEYt, then the coefficient of variation is calculated as: 
()()CVYSEY
Y=tt
t
and is usually shown as a percentage.
The 95% confidence interval for Yt (assuming a normal distribution) is expressed as the 
approximation,
2SE () YY-tt to 2SEC(Y) Y+tt131
 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
344. Sampling error usually increases as breakdowns become more detailed and the sample sizes 
smaller. Some statistical offices disseminate the precision measures for highly aggregated 
indicators (e.g., the proportion of businesses using the Internet and the same indicator by 
broad size interval). In addition, NSOs should indicate any cell estimates where the CV is over 
a particular level (e.g., 20 per cent).
345. A business sample may be designed using information from previous or pilot surveys so that 
the maximum standard error for the indicator proportion of businesses using computers is 
5 per cent for the total business population and less than 10 per cent for any ISIC section.
8.2.3 Bias
346. Bias (often referred to as non-sampling error) in statistical estimates is caused by various 
imperfections of the measurement system. Because it is usually not possible to give a 
measure of bias, it is necessary to inform users about possible sources of bias and attempts 
made to minimize it. It is important to recognize that bias errors can be in opposite directions 
and can therefore cancel to some extent. Bias can arise from:
• Non-response (where the characteristics of the responding population differ from those of 
the non-responding population);
• Respondent errors (e.g., a tendency to underestimate income);
• Errors in the population frame (e.g., coverage errors, misclassification errors);
• Sub-optimal questionnaire design (e.g., unclear instructions or definitions, poor flow);
• Systematic errors by interviewers (e.g., leading respondents to particular answers); and
• Processing errors (e.g., in data entry, data editing, estimation and tabulation errors).
8.2.4 Reference date and period
347. The reference date and reference period are the date and period (respectively) to which the 
indicators refer. Characteristics such as use of the Internet or number of employees  who use 
computers  vary over time and therefore questions must refer to specific dates or periods to 
guarantee the coherence of the answer by different respondents.
348. For ICT indicators, the time references are of two types: reference period (generally last 12 
last months, last calendar year or fiscal year) and reference date. Core indicators B1, B2, 
B3, B4, B7, B8, B9 and B12 (which relate to ICT use) have a 12-month reference period. If 
the question is asked in respect to the last 12 months,  then problems can arise if the data 
collection phase spans several months. For this reason, it is suggested that a particular 
period (such as the last calendar year or the year ended 30 June 202X ) is used as the 
reference period and that the survey date (date of interview or dispatch of questionnaires) is 
as close as possible to the last day of the reference period.
349. Core indicators B5, B6, B10 and B11 (related to existing infrastructure) have as their time 
reference a specific day prior to the survey date. This is usually the last day of the reference 
period, for example 31 December 202X , or shortly after.
350. Metadata should refer to the reference date and period used, and explain any discrepancies 
arising from changes or from delays in data collection. Such information would typically be 
included in table headings, as notes to tables and/or in a survey execution report.UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 2020132
8.2.5 Scope of indicators
351. The scope of an indicator is defined by the population to which it refers. Most indicators on 
the use of ICT by businesses are proportions67, the denominator of which is determined by 
the scope specification of the survey in terms of size, economic activity, and so forth:
• Indicators B1, B3, B5, B6, B7, B8, B9, B10, B11 and B12 are calculated as proportions 
with respect to all in-scope businesses, i.e., with respect to the target population of 
businesses;
• Indicators B2 and B4 are calculated using as denominator the total number of employees 
of all in-scope businesses; and
• For indicators B7, B8, B9 and B12, an alternative calculation is possible. These indicators 
can be calculated as a percentage of the subpopulation of businesses that use the Internet 
(i.e., the numerator of indicator B3).
352. It is especially important that the denominator of indicators B7, B8, B9 and B12 is made quite 
clear in each table (whether it is the total number of in-scope businesses or the total number 
of in-scope businesses that use the Internet, or the total number of the in-scope business 
in a particular industry or size categories). For international comparisons, it is desirable that 
these indicators are presented and published as proportions of the whole population of in-
scope businesses, although international reporting might require that data be submitted in 
absolute numbers.68
8.3 - Dissemination of metadata for surveys
353. At the survey level, there are a variety of metadata of interest to users. All indicators produced 
from the survey will share these metadata. They are related to the type of data source (be 
it a stand-alone survey or a module attached to an existing sample survey or census), the 
scope and coverage of the survey, classifications and definitions, and methodological issues 
including any technicalities of data collection. All these metadata are of relevance for assessing 
comparability with other national and international data. The metadata for a survey can be 
presented as a ‘survey execution report’ and is recommended to include the following items.
8.3.1 Rationale
354. Usually, a survey to collect ICT indicators derives from user demand and is expressed 
formally by a decision to include the necessary measurement work in the national statistical 
programme. The survey execution report should describe any legislation that refers to the 
origin of the data collection exercise and details of decisions taken to implement the operation 
(such as a recommendation by a national statistical council).
8.3.2 Description of data sources
355. As we have seen, data sources for indicators on ICT use by businesses can be diverse and 
include administrative records, big data sources, stand-alone ICT surveys and modules in 
existing surveys. For that reason, metadata should refer to the nature of the data source(s) 
used for the calculation of ICT indicators. This is particularly important in the case of indicators 
expressed as a proportion since the numerator and denominator may be obtained from 
different data sources.
67 For national purposes and for specific users (such as analysts), the publication of absolute figures may also be 
convenient.
68 For example, the UNCTAD questionnaire on ICT usage by businesses and on the ICT sector requests absolute 
numbers for analysis (calculation) purposes.133
 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
8.3.3 Timeliness and punctuality
356. Timeliness can be defined as the time interval between the availability of results and the 
date of reference of the information presented. Punctuality is the measurement of the delay 
between the anticipated date of release and the actual date of release. Both characteristics 
are easy to quantify and a quality report should include appropriate measures.
8.3.4 Data accessibility
357. Data accessibility is related to how easy it is for data users to obtain statistical results and 
associated metadata. It is related to the physical means available for data publication (paper, 
electronic, web-based), to the requirements for access (subscription, payment, free of charge, 
use of copyright, references to the producer institution, etc.) and how aware users are of 
available data and how it can be accessed (dissemination calendars, lists of distribution, etc.).
8.3.5 Statistical units, scope and coverage
358. Metadata should describe the statistical units used (establishments, enterprises, etc.), and 
how they have been defined. Any distinctions between reporting, observation and analytical 
units should be made clear. Impacts on the estimates from deviations from the recommended 
unit (enterprise) or changes over time should be described, even if it is not possible to quantify 
them.
359. Scope and coverage of a survey were discussed earlier in this Manual  (Chapter 7). Metadata 
should specify the scope of the survey in terms of at least size and economic activity (and 
often geography). Any coverage limitations related to the scope should be specified e.g., 
whether there are some industries or geographical areas that have not been included in the 
survey or have been treated differently.
8.3.6 Response rate
360. An important item of metadata is the final response rate for the survey (overall and for major 
disaggregations). The response rate is calculated as the proportion of live (eligible) units 
responding to the survey. Disaggregation of response rate, by size for example, are useful in 
conveying an indication of non-response bias.
8.3.7 Statistical standards: concepts, classifications and definitions
361. Major concepts used should be described in the metadata set. An example would be 
concepts underlying the measurement of e-commerce. This is especially relevant in digital 
economy measurement, due to the fast pace at which technology evolves.
362. Classificatory variables are used to break down indicators. The key classifications for ICT 
indicators are economic activity and size. The metadata for the survey should indicate 
whether the classifications used correspond to international classifications (ISIC, for example), 
or whether there are important differences. Metadata should also describe any classificatory 
concepts that could be ambiguous. For example, descriptions like “small and medium 
businesses” need to be precisely defined (generally in terms of number of employees).
363. Definitions (for instance, of ‘broadband’ or ‘computer’) and classifications are key elements for 
the assessment of international comparability of ICT indicators and coherence with alternative 
information sources (such as private surveys). Changes in definitions and classifications can 
also affect comparability of indicators over time and should be well documented.UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 2020134
8.3.8 Data collection method and questionnaire
364. Users should be informed about the sample design and method of data collection used (face-
to-face interviews, telephone interviews, mailed questionnaires). Publishing the questionnaireused to collect data is generally of great help for more advanced users who may benefit fromknowing the exact wording of questions.
8.4 - Metadata reports
365. Many countries have their own reporting proformas for survey reports and indicator-levelreporting.
69 It is suggested that metadata reported for ICT use surveys include a description
of the topics shown in Table 18.
69 For example, see Eurostat’s metadata reporting standards for the EU at https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/
metadata/metadata-structure or the IMF Standards for Data Dissemination at https://www.imf.org/en/
About/Factsheets/Sheets/2016/07/27/15/45/Standards-for-Data-DisseminationTopic Description (metadata to be included)
General information Rationale for survey, data sources used, reference period and date, date of survey, 
survey vehicle (where applicable), data collection methods, pilot tests undertaken (if any); major methodological differences compared to previous or related data collection exercises; timeliness and punctuality including changes over time; data accessibility.
Statistical units, scope and coverageDefinition of statistical units used: enterprises, establishments, multinational groups etc.; differences between national unit concepts and international standards and an assessment, if available, of the consequences of the differences; use of reporting, observation and analytical units.
Definition of scope and target population including economic activity, size and 
geography; description (and quantification if possible) of any coverage limitations in respect of the scope.
Concepts, classifications and definitionsConcepts and their basis (e.g., OECD information society statistics standards) should be described, along with any deviation or changes over time; classifications used should be stated and any inconsistencies with international standards described (with a broad impact analysis if possible); classification categories should be defined (e.g., size and geographic categories); definitions of key terms (e.g., computer) should be presented and major deviations from international standards and changes over time described.
Information on the questionnaireThe actual questionnaire used in the survey should be included in the report, if possible, with indications of significant changes over time and major deviations from international model questions.
Population frame Name and description of the population frame or underlying business register used, origin, updating periodicity, available segmentation variables, and any known shortcomings (e.g., size intervals or sector information not reliable; particular under- or over-coverage issues); changes in the frame over time (e.g., introduction of new updating sources for the business register) should be described and their impact indicated (if significant).
Sample design Type of sample design (simple or stratified random sample, systematic sample, multi-stage, clustered etc.), sampling units (one stage, two stages), stratification and sub-stratification criteria, sample size and allocation criteria, sample selection schemes, additional measures taken at the time of sampling design to improve representativeness, sample overlap control and sample rotation.
Weighting procedures Calculation of weights based on sample design, non-response adjustments, adjustments to external data (level, variables used and sources) and final weights.
Types of estimates used for each kind of indicator (percentages, means, percentiles, 
totals, etc.) and its corresponding breakdowns.Table 18   Descriptions of metadata135
 PART B. METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
Topic Description (metadata to be included)
Unit non-response and 
misclassificationFinal response rate (total and for major aggregations), gross sample size (final selected 
sample), number of misclassification cases and ineligible cases, number of eligible 
businesses, number of non-contacts, number of cases unable to respond, other 
non-response, net sample size (final effective sample). In addition, the report can 
give further detail about the methods used for minimizing non-response as well as 
the methods for dealing with unit non-response (e.g., telephone follow up or written 
reminders).
Size and distribution of unit non-response. A simple indicator that can be calculated 
for the whole sample and for significant breakdowns is the ratio between non-
responding and live units in the sample; the definition of the ratio is r = n*/n, where 
n is the number of eligible units in the sample and n* the number of completed 
interviews or questionnaires for eligible units.
It should be noted that out-of-scope units should be removed from both the 
numerator and denominator, and if substitutions are made in the case of unit non-
response, non-response rates should be provided before and after substitution; 
if substitution is applied, the following information should be provided: method 
of selection of substitutes and any major differences in the characteristics of 
substituted units compared to original units.
Item non-response Item non-response: details of any variables or items with response rates below a 
specified break value (50 per cent for instance) and methods used for dealing with 
item non-response, e.g., the form of imputation.
An indication of the number and percentage of missing or invalid responses for the 
main variables of the questionnaire is useful.
Accuracy and precision 
measuresThe report should indicate, at least, the standard error or coefficient of variation 
(relative standard error) for a selected group of indicators or sub-indicators; other 
alternatives are to provide some information (e.g., lookup tables) that allows users to 
calculate approximate errors. 
The formulas used for calculating sampling errors of main indicators and their 
corresponding breakdowns should be presented; it is also helpful to provide the 
effective sample size.
In respect to indicator level metadata, it is useful to indicate any table cells that have 
a high CV (for instance, as notes to tables).
While bias is usually not measurable, the report should include likely sources of bias 
and attempts made to minimize it.UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 2020136
PART C. INSTITUTIONAL ISSUES
Chapter 9 – Cooperation and coordination
366. Chapter 9 addresses relationships between actors in the statistical system, namely the 
cooperation and coordination between NSOs and other stakeholders – data providers, other 
data producers and data users. It also covers the inclusion of digital economy statistics 
in official statistical work programmes; international data collection and methodological 
work (already presented in Chapter 2 with regard to the Partnership on Measuring ICT for 
Development ); and capacity-building activities.
367. It is of the utmost importance that digital economy statistics be included in official statistical 
work programmes. Not only is this generally the most efficient way of using statistical 
infrastructure resources but it also provides strong support for indicators by giving an official 
“stamp” to the results. 
368. The use of unofficial data on the digital economy is discussed in this Chapter, to provide 
orientations to NSOs on how to deal with these data sources, given the increasing collection 
of data from mobile operators, Internet providers, payment systems, etc. and the growing 
size of digital traces of the economic activities. 
9.1 - Cooperation among stakeholders of the national statistical system
369. Digital economy indicators can be produced from a variety of sources and be generated 
by different national institutions and private organizations. In order to optimize the use of 
existing resources, it is important to foster institutional coordination between data providers, 
producers and users. This includes collaboration with data providers (especially regarding 
response burden in the case of business surveys, and quality assurance in the case of private 
data sources), coordination among data producers (to increase the efficiency of technical 
and financial resources for data production) and cooperation with data users (to help them 
understand the statistics and to satisfy their data requirements).
370. It is strongly recommended that production of digital economy indicators be undertaken 
by an independent National Statistical Office (NSO). (Where a national statistical system is 
decentralized, there may be several official statistical agencies. For simplicity, this Manual  refers 
to them as constituting a National Statistical Office .) This will provide advantages in managing 
relationships within the national statistical system. Additionally, statistical surveys carried out 
by NSOs often benefit from legislation ensuring compulsory response, which thus reduces 
non-response. The NSO is usually a central government institution specializing in statistics 
and able to optimize the efficient use of physical, human and technical resources (such as 
data collection networks, trained interviewers, statistical specialists, business registers and 
survey vehicles). Users will also benefit from using official statistics and associated metadata 
and will have confidence in the data released.137
9.1.1 Collaboration with data providers
371. As Figure 8 shows, providers of data that can be used to produce digital economy indicators 
(on the use of ICT by businesses, e-commerce, the ICT sector and trade in ICT goods and 
services) are potentially diverse. Before planning the collection of digital economy indicators, 
NSOs should consider the response burden that businesses and other providers would bear, 
defined as the effort required of them to assemble and communicate data. A high response 
burden may result in non-response to surveys and, consequently, bias in statistical estimates.
372. Data collection procedures should be designed to minimize the response burden of all data 
providers, but especially individual businesses. Mechanisms to reduce burden include the use 
of administrative information, well-designed questionnaires, electronic data collection, and 
use of rotating and non-overlapping samples. It is in the interests of data quality that response 
burden be kept reasonable in relation to the usefulness of the information provided and that 
data providers’ requests be considered by statistics producers. Frequent consultation with 
data providers, both in formal settings (e.g., statistical councils where they are represented) 
and in informal ones (e.g., via NSO operations staff), is useful in improving the relationship 
with them. 
373. The collection of data by statistical agencies may be required by law. This is the case in 
most countries, for at least some of the statistical operations carried out by NSOs and data 
collection by regulatory authorities. Foreign trade operations (above a certain value threshold) 
are also recorded on a mandatory basis. Units to be surveyed must be properly informed of 
the legal basis of the data collection, including their legal obligations and any penalties for 
failure to comply.
374. Confidentiality is a crucial issue in the relationship between data producers and data 
providers. Decisions on investment and use of ICT by businesses are an integral part of 
their business strategies, and they may be reluctant to disclose sensitive information to third PART C. INSTITUTIONAL ISSUES

parties.70 Statistical laws usually provide a guarantee of data confidentiality and protection. 
These safeguards need to be effectively communicated to respondents, for instance through 
explicit mention in questionnaires or covering letters, or by interviewers (see Example 18). Chapter 8 explores the implications of confidentiality protection for dissemination plans.
375. Some NSOs have put in place incentive systems to foster the cooperation of data providers, thereby minimizing non-response. One such incentive is to provide useful information in exchange for data (such as information comparing the situation of the business with that of others in its industry).
9.1.2 Cooperation and coordination among data producers
376. While it is strongly recommended that indicators on the digital economy be produced by NSOs, in a number of developing economies there are currently a variety of public and private producers of ICT data, including relevant ministries, regulatory authorities (issuing licenses and supervising markets), private observatories and research organizations. Coordination and cooperation among data producers are thus fundamental to the production of high-quality statistics. Other benefits include reduction of the overall response burden, avoidance of duplication of effort and optimization of the efficient use of resources.
70 Anecdotal evidence indicates that sensitivity applies particularly to revealing information about IT security 
breaches.Example 18  Republic of Moldova: Legal provisions for compulsory r esponse
The questionnaire for the survey on use of ICT and computational techniques run by the statistical ofﬁce of the Republic of Moldova refers to relevant statistical legislation on the cover page of the questionnaire. The law provides that State statistical institutions are entitled to ask for data from all physical and legal persons. At the same time, in terms of provisions for compulsory response, the Law on Official Statistics states in its fifteenth article that:
The producers of official statistics are obliged to inform the respondents about the legal purpose 
and basis of the statistical surveys, about their rights and obligations.
The producers of official statistics provide the respondents who participate in the statistical survey 
with the necessary statistical tools. The producers of official statistics are obliged to publish the statistical tools on their web page or in the Official Monitor of the Republic of Moldova.
When conducting the surveys, according to the statistical works program, the respondents are 
obliged: a) to present to the producers of official statistics free of charge reliable and complete data in the manner established by the respective official statistics producer; and b) to ensure the free access of the representatives of the producers of official statistics to the supporting documents and, if necessary, to the service and production rooms, according to the legal provisions.
The producers of official statistics have the right to remunerate the respondents for participating 
in the statistical surveys, in accordance with the legal provisions. Natural persons are not obliged to submit to the producers of official statistics personal information about ideological beliefs, political membership, criminal record, health and intimate life.

 PART C. INSTITUTIONAL ISSUES
377. While technical expertise on ICT subject matters may be higher in ICT-related institutions,
for several reasons NSOs are generally in a better position than other organizations tocollect statistics. In many countries the NSO is the central point of the national statisticalsystem and plays a coordinating role enshrined by law. The multiplicity of actors involved innational statistical systems, particularly in relation to digital economy indicators, necessitatesinstitutional leadership, and given their area of expertise, NSOs are usually best placed toexercise this.
378. National statistical systems have varying degrees of structure and coordination. Most countries have a system structured within a legal framework, which puts in place coordination bodies(for example, interministerial commissions or national statistical councils) where stakeholdersare represented. Such inter-institutional structures may also work in thematic groups (forinstance, related to particular topics). In the case of digital economy statistics, the existenceof formal institutional links between the NSO and pertinent ministries, as well as the explicitinclusion of ICT statistics in the schedule of official statistics production, are vital for relevantofficial statistics (see Example 19).
379. Other forms of collaboration among data-producing organizations could take the form ofthematic cooperation agreements or inter-agency working groups with clearly definedresponsibilities for establishing technical standards (e.g., for data collection and analysis,fieldwork and the verification and dissemination of findings). Before starting collection of dataExample 19  Philippines: Coordination of ICT statistics in the national statistical 
system
The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) was formed in 2013 as the central authority on statistics 
in the Philippines to act as coordinator of the Philippine Statistical System. It has set down the 
statistical framework for ICT statistics in the country and implements ICT surveys. The PSA 
co-chairs with the Department of ICT an Interagency Committee on ICT Statistics that includes 
all government Departments with a stake in the country ’s information society, such as the 
Departments of Trade and Industry, of Education, of Science and Technology, and of the Interior 
and Local Government, as well as the National Telecommunications Commission, the National 
Economic and Development Authority, the Commission on Higher Education, the Philippine 
Chamber of Telecommunication Operators, and the Information Technology and Business 
Process Association. Information Economy Statistics have a dedicated chapter in the Philippine 
Statistical Development Program (PSDP).
While the PSA is responsible for the establishment Survey on ICT (SICT), a rider to the Annual 
Survey of Philippine Business and Industry, it also ensures the quality and relevance of other 
statistics related to the digital economy generated by other official stakeholders. These include 
statistics generated by national accounts (trade in ICT goods and services) and administrative 
data (investment in the ICT sector, business registration, ICT trademarks and patents), as well as 
other surveys covering the labour force, education and e-government.
The transparent coordination of ICT statistics in the Philippines statistical system also ensures 
that the indicators produced are useful to support policies such as the National Broadband Plan, 
the National Cybersecurity Plan, and the Philippine Development Plan 2017-2022. The PSA aims 
to make ICT statistics part of its System of Designated Statistics, which designates the essential 
statistics for social and economic planning.

on the digital economy, the NSO should carefully assess the existence (see GSBPM phase 
“Specify needs” in Chapter 5), in other governmental organizations, of technical expertise and 
data infrastructure (such as business or administrative registers).
380. The powers of NSOs may be such that, inter alia, other organizations are obliged to consult 
them before altering administrative records that could be used for statistical purposes or 
before undertaking statistical work. Also, NSOs confer official status on the data they produce 
and may have responsibility for the preparation of national statistical plans. Legislation may 
endow NSOs with certain powers, for instance the power to establish technical procedures 
and standards, definitions, nomenclatures and survey frameworks.
381. Some governmental organizations may collect administrative data useful for measuring the 
digital economy (see Chapter 5). This includes tax authorities (e.g., collecting e-invoices), 
customs or telecom operators. The access to and use of administrative data may require 
an adequate legal framework in addition to technical cooperation for the establishment of 
methodological standards (definition of concepts, metadata, etc.).
382. Coordination of statistical activities between NSOs and other agencies in the national 
statistical system to produce digital economy indicators should include technical, legal, and 
resource coordination.
Technical coordination
• Establishment and coordinated use of definitions of digital economy concepts and relevant 
classifications. These definitions should be based on international standards but be 
adapted to country conditions.
• Coordination of digital economy statistics within the broader domain of economic statistics, 
considering the established measurement frameworks (e.g., System of National Accounts, 
Balance of Payment statistics, classifications of economic activities).
• Establishment of population frames for business surveys.
• Establishment of procedures for the preparation and dissemination of standardized 
metadata by agencies in the national statistical system.
Legal coordination
• Establishment of an adequate institutional framework to represent the institutions that 
produce information, including (at least) the national authorities, in the areas of technological 
infrastructure, science, telecommunications and so forth.
• Legal provisions that NSOs can use (following appropriate analysis and consensus) to 
establish technical standards that are obligatory for other data producers.
• Legal provisions for the access by NSOs to administrative data held by other governmental 
institutions, as well as from private operators.
• Legal provisions to confer official status on statistics from data collection exercises 
conducted by institutions that are members of the national statistical system (this is 
particularly important in the case of statistical operations financed by external agents 
without prior integration into national programmes of statistical activities).
• A legal framework to ensure sustainable funding from the national budget (or from donor 
cooperation, where relevant) for the operation of national statistical systems and for the 
implementation of programmes of statistical work.141
 PART C. INSTITUTIONAL ISSUES
Coordination in resource allocation
• Development of synergies among the different institutions’ financial resources for the 
implementation of large-scale surveys (for example, collaboration with registration offices for the design of business population frames).
• Making good use of the technical capacities of highly qualified staff in the national statistical system, for instance by having them participate in inter-agency task forces and training programmes, as well-trained survey enumerators.
• Efficient use of ICT resources available within different agencies in the national statistical system, and other cooperating organizations, for data collection, processing and dissemination.
• Coordination of financial resources (from external sources and between agencies involved in the project).
9.1.3 Unofficial data on the digital economy
A wealth of unofficial statistics exists on the digital economy, compiled by private actors (think tanks, consultancies, sector associations, research centres, etc., as well as based on data collected for operational purposes by providers of ICT services, such as mobile network operators or Internet providers).
383. Unofficial sources may be used to give background or context to data from official sources, to assess official data on their plausibility, to cover information gaps by imputing missing values, etc. The Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics recognize that all sources are potentially usable for official statistics:
Principle 5. Data for statistical purposes may be drawn from all types of sources, be they 
statistical surveys or administrative records. Statistical agencies are to choose the source with regard to quality, timeliness, costs, sustainability in time and the burden on respondents.
384. Using unofficial statistics to compile official statistics has been suggested to fill the information gaps in several areas, such as the monitoring of the SDGs. This possibility of “accreditation” of unofficial sources has to be studied by NSOs and international organizations on the basis of quality assessments (using, for instance, the UN Statistical Quality Assessment Framework).
71 The recommended practices72 for using unofficial sources by international 
organizations include:
• The prior validation of their quality following professional standards in terms of accuracy, relevance, independence, availability, comparability, etc.
• The documentation of the quality assessment, the methods used (for imputation or estimation).
• The dissemination with clear and accessible metadata, with adequate “flags” indicating the unofficial nature of data.

9.1.4 Cooperation with data users
385. Digital economy indicators are required by a variety of users: public policymakers to design
technology policies, businesses to benchmark against competitors and make informeddecisions, researchers to evaluate the impact of ICT use on productivity and workingconditions, and the international community to compare the deployment of ICT across arange of countries. Because public resources are devoted to the production of ICT statistics,NSOs and other data producers wish to maximize their dissemination and facilitate their use.
386. Dissemination of digital economy data should be guided by the needs of users and followbest international practices. Data producers should constantly assess the demand for digitaleconomy indicators. Contacts with – and feedback from – data users, in the frameworkof national statistical councils or technical working groups, can help the NSO and otherdata producers to better understand demand for digital economy statistics. In developingeconomies, civil society groups and NGOs have a major role to play in bridging the digitaldivide and assisting socially excluded groups. Civil society participation in the specificationof data collection, via the participation of business associations, the media, universities andresearch centres, is more likely to ensure that data will be relevant to the digital economy dataneeds of such groups.
387. Dissemination formats and tools should increase the transparency of methodology. Digitaleconomy statistics publications (in paper, in electronic format and/or on the Web) shouldprovide not only numerical estimates, but also the metadata that are required in order tounderstand the data (see Chapter 8 for a discussion of metadata topics to be disseminated).An example is the quality reporting profiles prepared by Eurostat, which cover several areasof statistics.
73
388. Other aspects of cooperation with users relate to the timeliness and accessibility of statisticalinformation. ICT evolution is faster than the evolution of other economic and social processes,and data quickly become outdated. The earliest possible dissemination of data, preferablybased on a pre-determined dissemination calendar, will be of great help to users.
389. Equity of access is an important principle that dictates that all users should have equalaccess to data, irrespective of their economic and social circumstances. Arranging suchaccess is becoming easier with tools such as web-based statistical dissemination. The useof a variety of data dissemination formats (rapid notices, yearbooks, specific publications,electronic databases, etc.) should be considered in order to maximize the use of statistics.
9.2 - Statistical work programmes
390. As we have seen, effective monitoring of the information economy requires high-quality andtimely statistical information. One-off measuring exercises may provide a picture of the digitaleconomy situation at a given point in time, but the rapid evolution of technologies, usagepractices and policy interests quickly render one-off estimates outdated. A medium-termsustained programme of surveys and analysis is therefore necessary in order to monitorchanges.
391. National statistical programmes are coordination and planning tools that are increasinglybeing adopted by countries. They comprise a set of statistical operations to be carried outand assign responsibilities to the various institutions that constitute the national statisticalsystem. They would normally also include estimates of financial resources required in order
73 Eurostat has applied quality profiles to various data sets such as those on employment, innovation and 
research, environment, social cohesion and others. The reports are available at http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.
eu/143
 PART C. INSTITUTIONAL ISSUES
to undertake the statistical programme. They can span annual or multi-annual periods and 
are periodically revised to reflect changes, including users’ new data requirements. Usually, statistical programmes are validated by a high-level multi-institutional group, where data producers and users are represented, before their approval and adoption by Governments.
392. Statistical operations related to the digital economy should be included in national statisticalprogrammes (see Example 20) in order to:
•Increase the engagement of Governments for funding and other assistance, in a sustainable manner;
•Communicate plans to users, including when data are expected to be available; and
•Coordinate the technical and financial resources of the NSO and other data producers.
393. It is recommended that digital economy statistics collections that are based on businesssurveys be coordinated with other business surveys in terms of timing and target populations,so that combined analysis of the e-business processes and other economic variables canbe undertaken.
394. Several developing economies have prepared their National Strategy for the Developmentof Statistics (NSDS) and statistical master plans, which are also being promoted by theinternational community of donors.
74 NSDS are intended to encompass all statistical activities
of public institutions in a country, not only those of the NSO. They therefore provide a toolfor coordination and sustainability of statistical production. Countries that are in the processof preparing master plans and NSDSs should consider the inclusion of digital economymeasurement work in medium- and long-term planning.
74 For instance, the STATCAP and the TFSCB funds managed by the World Bank support the pr eparation and 
implementation of statistical master plans.Example 20 Chile: Inclusion of ICT surveys in the statistical programme
The national statistical system of Chile is organized by means of a national statistical programme 
that is updated annually. The programme includes structured information about all the official 
statistical operations carried out not only by the NSO (INE) but also by ministries and other public 
institutions. It includes the description of statistical operations in terms of responsible institutions, 
general and specific objectives, targets for data dissemination, periodicity, geographical coverage 
and sources of information. For example, in 2019 the programme clarified that statistical operations 
related to the digital economy included enterprise surveys and innovation surveys under 
the responsibility of the Sub-secretariat of Economy and Small Enterprises, or e-banking 
services under the Bank Superintendency. It provides contact details for each statistical 
operation, helping users navigate the data producer ecosystem and find the information they 
are interested in, and is available as a publication (directory) and an online search engine.

9.3 - International data collection and methodological work
395. The need for international benchmarking, research and policy advice on digital economy 
issues has led to data collection initiatives by several international organizations. Many 
countries cooperate with international organizations to compile internationally comparable 
ICT data, while also satisfying national needs for indicators. Several regional and international 
initiatives on the collection of harmonized ICT data have been undertaken in the past few 
years by UNCTAD, the ITU, the UN Regional Commissions, OECD and Eurostat.
396. At the global level, the UNSC, at its 49th session in March 2018, reviewed the work of the 
Partnership, endorsed the updated core list of ICT indicators, including new ones on ICT trade 
in services and ICT-enabled services, and encouraged countries to adopt the indicators. The 
UNSC periodically reviews such list.
397. The Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development  has a coordination and facilitation role 
in the area of international measurement of the information society, the digital economy 
and related topics The Partnership periodically reports to the UNSC for an update of the 
international work on measuring information and communications technologies. See Chapter 
2 for more detail on the work of the different member organizations of the Partnership .
9.4 - Capacity-building issues
398. The production of digital economy indicators in developing economies must be seen in the 
context of the general strengthening of national statistical systems. Countries that are willing 
to start producing such indicators should coordinate this activity with current or planned 
national capacity-building activities for statistical infrastructure (e.g., legal frameworks for 
statistics, business registers and data collection networks) and statistical practices (e.g., 
implementation of business surveys). Production of indicators on the digital economy should 
not be considered separately from those other issues since duplication of efforts and other 
inefficiencies can arise. Countries starting the collection of such indicators should consider 
the following capacity-building issues:
• Statistics capacity assessment: before planning any intervention in capacity-building, a 
careful assessment of institutional and staff capacities must be undertaken. This includes 
identifying weak areas in terms of institutional setting (e.g., legislation, compliance with 
codes of practice, organizational chart, distribution of responsibilities across departments), 
implementation of statistical processes (for which the use of standards such as GSBPM 
and GAMSO can again help); IT infrastructure; as well as technical and “soft” skills of staff.
• Improvement of the legal framework for statistical surveys: digital economy business 
surveys (whether dedicated to ICT or vehicles for ICT modules) should ideally be subject 
to statistical laws that establish obligations, such as compulsory provision of data and 
protection of those data by the NSO and other official statistical agencies. The legislative 
framework may also establish legal mechanisms for implementation and funding of 
statistical operations. In some countries, revision of the legal framework for statistical 
surveys could increase the efficiency of the data collection system (see Box 24).145
 PART C. INSTITUTIONAL ISSUES
• Establishment and improvement of business registers: the process of creating a business 
register for digital economy data collection should be coordinated with general plans to 
establish a business register or improve an existing one (see Chapter 7).
• Improvement of data collection systems: capacity-building projects for enhancing data 
collection should avoid duplication of structures that already exist, such as a network of 
data collection centres (which are generally spread over the country) that report to the 
central or regional statistical authorities.
• Coordination of the system of business statistics: current programmes of capacity-
building for business statistics should be coordinated with other economic statistics. In 
many developing economies, there are international cooperation programmes devoted to 
implementing new business surveys or to adapting international standards within existing 
systems. These programmes should be considered by countries willing to carry out digital 
economy surveys.
• Training human resources for statistical production: different types of staff are needed 
for the production and analysis of digital economy statistics: interviewers, data coders, 
statisticians and economists. Besides specific knowledge (for example, of ICT standards, 
concepts and definitions), staff will usually need to have statistical expertise (for example, 
in collecting data, units and classifications, business sampling methods, statistical 
estimation, data processing techniques and statistical dissemination practices). Capacity-
building programmes in business statistics should include staff involved in the production 
of ICT indicators.
• Enhancing the capacity for data dissemination: the implementation of statistical 
dissemination systems for digital economy indicators, such as online databases or web 
dissemination, can be coordinated with similar initiatives for other statistical projects within 
statistical organizations. Data visualization skills can improve the accessibility of digital 
economy statistics.Box 24 The case for revision of statistical legislation to improve ICT statistics
The statistical legislation of developing economies may be the subject of revision, especially when 
countries have experienced important political or economic changes. With respect to ICT statistics, 
such changes might lead to the inclusion, on national statistical councils, of ministries responsible 
for science and technology or telecommunications, organizations representing the business and 
research community, and so forth.
In transition economies, the exhaustiveness of business surveys established by statistical laws for 
centrally planned economies may not be efficient compared with sample surveys if the business 
sector is developed (in particular, if the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector is very 
large).
In some countries, respect for the confidentiality of individual data may not be fully reflected in 
current laws, a fact that should be carefully considered.UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 2020146
399. Several international initiatives support the improvement of ICT statistics in developing
economies. The following capacity-building initiatives may be of interest to those economies:
•Several members of the Partnership on Measuring ICT for Development can providecapacity-building services to member States. In the field of business ICT indicators,including indicators on the ICT sector and trade in ICT goods, ICT services and ICT-
enabled services, UNCTAD provides technical assistance to countries interested in
improving their ICT data production systems in the form of training and advisory missions.In order to improve the availability of comparable statistics on ICT for development, thistechnical assistance must be combined with a commitment by countries to collect therecommended core ICT indicators.
•The consortium Partnership for Statistics in the 21st Century, PARIS21 (www.paris21.org),
provides a reference library for the preparation of statistical development strategies andmaster plans. Guidelines for the preparation of NSDS are provided by the PARIS21
consortium. The approach for capacity-building in national statistical systems is described
in the Guidelines for Developing Statistical Capacity.

Instructions for completing the form
Reporting Instructions
This form should be completed for the enterprise listed on page 1 of the form—unless different 
arrangements have been made.
Definition of enterprise: use the definition of reporting unit currently in use by the statistical office 
implementing the survey. The preferred statistical unit is the enterprise.
Residents and Non-residents
A non-resident is any individual, enterprise, or other organization ordinarily domiciled in an economy 
other than [Country].
Subsidiaries of non-resident enterprises in [Country] are residents of [Country]. Similarly, foreign 
subsidiaries of [national] enterprises are non-residents.
Conversion to [National currency]
All values should be reported in thousands of [National currency]. Foreign currencies should be 
converted to [National currency] at the midpoint of the buy and sell rates applicable on the date of 
the transaction.
Partner economy
The partner economy is defined as the country where the non-resident importer resides.
Services included
The survey deals exclusively with services that can be delivered remotely over ICT networks,  
so-called ICT-enabled services,  in the following categories:
1. Telecommunications;
2. Computer services (including computer software);
3. Sales and marketing services, not including trade and leasing services;
4. Information services (including audio-visual services and online content);
5. Management, administration and back office services;
6. Licensing services;
7. Engineering, related technical services and R&D;
8. Education and training services.
These categories of services are defined in detail below.
Exports of services
Exports of services are sales of services provided to non-resident importers. They correspond to 
services for which payment is made directly to your enterprise by a non- resident entity (including 
a foreign affiliate of your enterprise). Exports include services provided by your enterprise or its 
employees working abroad, or some other resident entity on whose behalf your enterprise receives 
payment. Exports exclude services that are provided to non-residents by your enterprise and paid 
for through other unrelated resident entities.
Modes of supply
Services can be exported in four different ways. First, your enterprise may remotely deliver 
services to a customer abroad through the Internet, phone, postal mail or email (this mode of 
supply is called cross-border supply). Second, you may deliver these services to a non-resident 
customer temporarily present in your country (this mode is called consumption abroad). Third, your 155
enterprise may have established a commercial presence in a foreign country to deliver services in 
the country of the consumer (this mode is called commercial presence). Fourth, these services can 
be delivered by one of your employees temporarily working abroad (this mode is called presence of 
natural persons). Below are more detailed definitions and examples of these four possible modes 
of supply.
Cross-border supply takes place when the service is remotely supplied to a customer abroad. 
This is similar to trade in goods where the product is delivered across international borders and the 
consumer and the supplier remain in their respective countries. For example, a law firm may deliver 
legal advice by phone to a foreign enterprise or individual, a physician may provide a medical 
diagnosis to a patient via e-mail or a financial services supplier may supply portfolio management 
or brokerage services across an international border via the Internet.
When identifying cross-border exports, please exclude sales to non-residents of the kind 
described below:
Consumption abroad  takes place when the service is provided to a non-resident customer 
travelling to [Country]. This also applies to services performed on the property of a non-resident 
customer. Tourist activities such as in-person visits to museums and theatres and travel abroad 
to receive medical treatment or attend language courses are typical examples. Services such as 
ship repair or aircraft refurbishment abroad, where only the property of the customer moves, or is 
situated abroad, are also covered.
Presence of natural persons  takes place when a person employed by your enterprise temporarily 
travels abroad to provide services to non-resident customers. Natural persons under consideration 
include:
 –Contractual service suppliers, employed by your enterprise;
 –Intra-corporate transferees and foreign employees directly recruited by your enterprise;
 –Service sellers who travel abroad to establish contractual relationships for a service 
contract, or persons responsible for setting up commercial presence.
This survey deals only with resident/non-resident transactions and thus does not cover commercial 
presence-related transactions. Thus, please exclude services provided to non-residents by non-
resident companies owned by your enterprise. Include services provided by your enterprise to 
related companies abroad (related party trade).
In addition, this survey also requires you to identify exports of services that specifically relate to 
cross-border supply.
Structure of the form
The form collects annual information on selected international service transactions of this enterprise.
Part A aims at collecting basic information about the enterprise.
Part B identifies exports of services that were delivered by the enterprise remotely over ICT networks 
(so-called ICT-enabled services) during the reporting period.
Part C allows detailing these ICT-enabled exports by type of service, mode of delivery and partner 
economy.ANNEX 3. UNCTAD MODEL QUESTIONNAIRE ON EXPORTS OF ICT-ENABLED SERVICESUNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 2020156

ANNEX 4. OECD MODEL QUESTIONNAIRE FOR 
ICT USE BY BUSINESSES77
Module A: Connectivity
Computer use
Definitions
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)  consist of the hardware, software, 
networks and media for the collection, storage, processing, transmission and presentation of 
information (voice, data, text, images), as well as related services.
Computers include personal computers, portable computers, tablets, other portable devices. 
They do not include smart phones or any other device, although with embedded computing abilities, when not used for computing (e.g. MP3 and other media players, game consoles, electronic dictionaries, GPS navigation devices, e-book readers etc.).
77 Modules A to E are extracted fr om Annex 2 of the OECD Model Survey on ICT Usage by Businesses (2nd Revision). 
The Annex 2 of the OECD Model Survey also includes the Complementary Modules F to L which are not included 
here. As noted in the OECD Model Survey, the Annex presents a collection of indicators, based on best practices and meant to offer a broad coverage of areas of policy interest and possible target variables, not a questionnaire: (a) The selection is intentionally very wide: not all the indicators are intended to be administered in one go; (b) Efforts were made to offer guidelines on definitions and routing to producers, not text to be proposed to final users: agencies approaching the implementation of a questionnaire are invited to consider current practices, as wording and sequencing of questions in surveys impact on responses; (c) Indicators were selected based on their policy relevance and on current practice: some are known to be problematic in terms of robustness and require particular caution in survey implementation (e.g. when relying on subjective assessments, such as “reasons for not doing something”, or when the respondent is not in charge of some decisions and might not be aware of them or even understand the question); (d) It should be kept in mind that the informative value of some indicators might be hampered under specific circumstances (e.g. presence of concurrent technologies, obligation to perform given procedures online); (e) some indicators and whole modules might be appropriate only in given contexts, e.g. for countries more (or less) advanced in the uptake of ICTs in businesses, or for large (or small) enterprises only, and (f) some indicators still have an experimental nature. See https://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/ICT-Model-Survey-Usage-Businesses.pdf.ANNEX 4. OECD MODEL QUESTIONNAIRE FOR ICT USE BY BUSINESSESUNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 2020182
Persons employed is the total number of persons who work in the observation unit (inclusive of 
working proprietors, partners working regularly in the unit and unpaid family workers), as well as persons who work outside the unit but belong to it and are paid by it (e.g. sales representatives, delivery personnel, repair and maintenance teams). It excludes manpower supplied by other enterprises, persons carrying out repair and maintenance work in the enquiry unit on behalf of other enterprises, as well as those on compulsory military service.
Broadband access
Definitions
•Broadband subscriptions have an advertised download speed greater than 256 Kbit/s.
•Wired (fixed) broadband connections  include xDSL, cable modem, optical fibre (e.g.
FTTx), leased lines, Ethernet, PLC, BPL;
•Fixed wireless connections include public-WIFI, satellite and terrestrial fixed wirelesssuch as fixed WiMAX, LMDS and MMDS;
•(Terrestrial wireless) Mobile broadband connections  include technologies such as
3G/LTE/4G, UMTS, CDMA2000, and any other future technology, including both standardand dedicated data subscriptions: these are typically used with portable devices (laptops,tablets, smartphones)
A2 Enterprises with broadband by type (fixed/
mobile)
(as a % of total enterprises)Wired and fixed wireless connections should be 
kept separated from mobile broadband connectivity.
Most countries have by now discontinued collecting 
information on narrowband connectivity, but this might still be appropriate for countries with a less developed telecommunication infrastructure.
A3 Connection speed (distribution) Maximum contracted download speed of the enterprise fastest fixed connection: a) 2 Mbit/s, b) up to 10 Mbit/s, c) up to 30 Mbit/s, d) up to 100 Mbit/s, e) up to 1 Gbit/s, f) at least 1 Gbit/s.A1 Persons employed r egularly using a computer

(b) high set up and maintenance costs, (c) lack of 
internal technical expertise.UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 2020184
Module C: Information Management Tools
Intranet and Extranet
Definitions
Intranet  is an internal company communication network that uses Internet protocol
Extranet  is a network that uses Internet protocol to securely share enterprise’s information with 
business partners. It can take the form of an extension to the enterprise Intranet or of a private part 
of its website.
EDI, ERP, CRM and RFID
Definitions
Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)  refers to the electronic transmission of data suitable for 
automated processing between enterprises or organisations:
• Sending and/or receiving of messages (e.g. payment transactions, tax declarations, 
orders, etc.) in an agreed or standard format suitable for automated processing, e.g. EDI, 
EDIFACT, XML , xCBL, cXML, ebXML, ODETTE, TRADACOMS;
• Without the individual message being typed manually.
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)  is a software package used to manage resources by 
sharing information among different functional areas (e.g. accounting, planning, production, 
marketing, etc.). ERP software can use EDI technology and be clubbed with or embed Customer 
relationship management functionalities (CRM).
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)  is a technology allowing for contactless transmission 
of information via radio waves. Data are contained in ‘RFID tags’ (transponders) applied or 
incorporated into products or objects, which can also be integrated with sensors. RFID can be 
used for a wide range of purposes, including personal identification or access control, logistics, 
retail trade and process monitoring in manufacturing.
78 EDI and RFID are listed here along with other major information management tools. However, taking into 
account the nature and diffusion of these technologies, monitoring might usefully be limited, e.g. to EDI sales 
(included in the E- commerce module) or to RFID use for given purposes, for some segments only (e.g. large 
firms), and/or be surveyed with longer intervals, e.g. every second or third year. A similar (rotation) strategy 
might be adopted for SCM. For this last indicator, some countries reported that the concept of exchange of 
information on supply chain management is interpreted in a different fashion between industries, and that 
interpretation might pose difficulties in some service activities.C1 Intranet (% of all enterprises)

Definitions
Sharing information electronically  on Supply Chain Management (SCM) refers to exchanging 
information with suppliers and/or customers about the availability, production, development or 
distribution of goods or services. This information may be exchanged via websites, networks or 
other means of electronic data transfer, but it excludes manually typed e-mail messages.
79 Particular care is recommended when collecting information on this indicator, as survey experience showed that 
answering is often difficult for respondents, which might not be aware of all functions being implemented.ANNEX 4. OECD MODEL QUESTIONNAIRE FOR ICT USE BY BUSINESSES
C4 Sharing electronically SCM information with 
suppliers and customers
(% of all enterprises, by type of partner)This is a double indicator: underlying data ought 
to be collected asking separately for suppliers and 
customers.78
C5 Automated share of information on orders 
received across different business functions
(% of all enterprises)This indicator refers to software integration, and 
the item might be usefully treated with reference 
to the use of an ERP software package and its 
functionalities.
Business functions may include management of 
inventory levels, accounting, production or services 
management, distribution management, etc.79
C6 Sending or receiving EDI-type messages 
suitable for automated processing for selected 
purposes
(% of all enterprises)Sending and receiving orders, e-invoices, product 
information, transport documents, paying 
instructions, data to public authorities.
C7 Barriers to sending or receiving EDI-type 
messages
(% of all enterprises)Reasons may include: lack of in-house expertise for 
implementation; low or uncertain expected returns; 
lack of appropriate software; difficulty in agreeing 
common standards with business partners; 
uncertainty of the legal status of the messages 
exchanged.
C8 Using CRM software to manage (collect, store, 
make available) and analyse information about 
customers
(% of all enterprises)Items may include (a) the collection, storing and 
availability of information about customers to 
various business functions, as well as (b) the 
analysis of information about customers for 
marketing purposes (e.g. setting prices, sales 
promotion, choosing distribution channels, etc.).
C9 Sharing of SCM-related information with 
suppliers
(% of all enterprises, possibly by type of information)For both indicators C9 and C10, items considered 
may include: (a) Demand forecasts, (b) Inventory 
levels, (c) Production plans, and (d) Progress 
of deliveries (i.e. distribution of raw materials or 
finished products).
Note: sharing considered is by electronic means 
only.C10 Sharing of SCM-related information with 
customers
(% of all enterprises)
C11 Methods used to exchange SCM-related 
information
(% of all enterprises, by method)Methods include (a) websites or web portals, and 
(b) electronic transmission allowing automatic 
processing methods (e.g. EDI-type systems, XML, 
EDIFACT, etc.).UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 2020186
Electronic invoicing
Definitions
There are invoices in paper form and electronic form. Invoices in electronic form  are of two 
types:
• E-invoices in a standard structure suitable for automated processing  (e.g. EDI, UBL, 
XML). E-invoices are exchanged either directly or via service operators or via an electronic 
banking system
• Invoices in electronic form not suitable for automated processing  (e.g. e-mails, e-mail 
attachment as pdf, image files, or similar).
Module D: Electronic Commerce
Definitions
An electronic commerce (e-commerce)  transaction is the sale or purchase of goods or services, 
conducted over computer networks by methods specifically designed for the purpose of receiving 
or placing of orders. The payment and the ultimate  delivery of the goods or services do not have 
to be conducted online.
• An e-commerce transaction can take place between enterprises, households, individuals, 
governments, and other public or private organisations. Enterprises’ e-commerce sales 
(E-sales)  with reference to customers the acronyms B2B (Business to Business) , B2C (– to 
Consumers) , or B2G (– to Government) .
• To be included are orders made over the web, extranet or electronic data interchange 
(EDI). The type is defined by the  method of placing the order. To be excluded are orders 
made by telephone calls, facsimile or manually typed e-mail.
• EDI transactions take place in an agreed or standard format which allows their automated 
processing (e.g. EDIFACT, UBL, XML) without the individual messages being typed 
manually.
• Web transactions are made via an online store (web shop), web forms on a website or 
extranet. Manually typed e-mails are to be excluded.C12 Barriers to the use ERP, CRM, RFID
(% relevance of barriers, by tool)Examples of barriers include: lack of relevance, 
lack of in- house expertise; employees’ resistance 
to changes in work- practices; low or uncertain 
expected returns; lack of appropriate software; high 
costs, unavailability of reliable support services.
In scope population: enterprises which do not use 
IM tools.
C13 Types of invoices sent by the enterprise
(% of all invoices; % of all enterprises)Types include (a) e-invoices in a standard structure 
suitable for automatic processing (e.g. EDI, UBL, 
XML, etc.), and (b) electronic invoices not suitable for 
automatic processing (e.g. emails, PDF documents, 
image files, or similar) and paper form invoices.
C14 E-invoices received by the enterprise
(% of all enterprises)E-invoices in a standard structure suitable for 
automatic processing (e.g. EDI, UBL, XML, etc.).187
 ANNEX 4. OECD MODEL QUESTIONNAIRE FOR ICT USE BY BUSINESSES
D1 Enterprises conducting e-commerce sales, by 
platform  (as a % of all enterprises)Platforms include (a) EDI and (b) web; figures for the 
two should be collected separately.
D2 E-sales value by platform and type of customer 
(as % of total turnover)Platforms include (a) EDI and (b) web. Customers 
include end consumers and other enterprises and 
government: these two latter categories might need 
being joined, where separate data are unavailable. 
As survey practice showed that respondents find 
it difficult to report their total e-sales (e-purchases), 
thesefigures might be better obtained by summing 
up components. Also, values can be collected in 
absolute terms.
D3 Web-sales breakdown by type of customer 
and geographic area (% of web-sales)Customers: (see above, D2).
Geographic area: own country; foreign countries. 
Value data ought to exclude value added taxes.
Information on value could prove difficult to collect or 
be unreliable; an alternative indicator might consider 
the number of enterprises with web-sales abroad (% 
of total, % of enterprises with web-sales).
D4 Means of payment accepted web-sales
(% of all enterprises, by means of payment)(a) Online:  payments integrated in the ordering 
transaction (e.g. credit, debit card, direct debit 
authorisation, via third party accounts); (b) Offline: 
the payment process is not included in the order 
transaction (e.g. cash on delivery, bank transfer, 
cheque payment and other non-online payment).
D5 Barriers to web-sales
(% relevance among enterprises)Barriers may include the following: (a) products 
unsuited for web-sales, (b) logistics, (c) payments, 
(d) security, (e) legal issues, and (f) low expected 
returns.
D6 EDI-sales breakdown by geographic area
(% of enterprises and % of EDI sales)Own country, foreign countries. Whereas information 
on values would prove difficult to collect or unreliable, 
an alternative indicator might consider the number 
of enterprises with EDI abroad (% of total, % of 
enterprises with web-sales).
D7 Enterprises conducting e-purchases
(as a % of all enterprises)Warning:  this indicator and D8 are considered 
relevant and included in the core group. However, 
they might prove to be problematic to survey, as 
purchase decisions are often decentralised within 
the enterprise. Respondents’ confusion between 
sales and purchases has also been observed.
D8 E-purchase value by platform
(as a % of total purchases)Platforms include EDI and web. Values can be 
collected in absolute terms (excluding VAT) and/or 
by bands and asking for components separately 
(see comments to D2 and D7).UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 2020188
Module E: Security and Privacy
Definitions
Management  represent measures, controls and procedures applied on ICT systems to ensure 
integrity, authenticity, availability and confidentiality of data and systems.
Privacy risks  refer to any danger that personal information stored by the enterprise be used for 
illegal purposes, or any other purpose not explicitly agreed by the interested party.
External attacks:  can be determined by injection of malicious software or unauthorised access, 
pharming (redirection of traffic to a fraudulent website)
(*) Incidents self-evaluation guidelines (scale):
Minor:  Addressed with routine intervention, which had no relevant impact in terms of time/
information/money loss.
Serious:  Demanded specific countermeasures (e.g. restoring back-up copies of disk information; 
in-depth analysis; service denial attack) and thus resulted in some costs in terms of time, information 
or money.
Critical:  An event that implied serious consequences, such as massive loss of information, disclosure 
of confidential data, system breakdowns and, in general, significant negative consequences in 
terms of productivity, money or reputation.E1 Formal policy to manage ICT security risks
(% of all enterprises)This indicator is a twin to the indicator on privacy, 
and aims at acknowledging the diffusion of formal 
guidelines to address risks among enterprises.
E2 Risks addressed by the ICT security policy of 
the enterprise  (% of enterprises, by occurrence)Risks include ICT failures and external attacks/
security breaches.
E3 ICT Incidents (security breaches) encountered 
by the enterprise  (% of enterprises, by occurrence)Incidents encountered include loss or disclosure of 
data or service unavailability, graded according to 
their seriousness*.
E4 Security facilities or procedures in place
(% of all enterprises)A taxonomy of facilities/procedures may include:
 –Identification and authentication (Strong 
password, Hardware tokens (e.g. smart cards), 
Biometric methods),
 –Intrusion detection systems (e.g. antivirus, 
antispyware, firewall, etc.),
 –Spam filter / Web filter,
 –Offsite data backup,
 –Staff awareness on their obligations on ICT 
security related issues (by training, information, 
contractual obligation),
 –Other aspects related to security policy 
management (Security manager, specific 
resources, regular review and audit plans)

81 With the introduction of the Framework Regulation on European Business Statistics the variable “persons 
employed” is replaced by the variable “employees and self-employed persons”. This change in the 
denomination of the variable does not imply any change in the scope. The two variables represent exactly the same concept. For the sake of user friendliness, the term “employees and self-employed persons” is only used in the introductory part of the questionnaire and in Module X, while in the rest of the questionnaire the term “persons employed” is used.Sampling unit: Enterprise.
Scope / Target Population: Economic activity:
Enterprises classified in the following categories of NACE Rev. 2:
- Section C –  “Manufacturing”;
- Section D, E – “ Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning 
supply”
“ Water supply , sewerage, waste management 
and remediation activities”;
- Section F – “Construction”;
- Section G – “ Wholesale and retail trade; r epair of motor 
vehicles and motorcycles”;
- Section H – “Transportation and storage”;
- Section I – “ Accommodation and food service activities”;
- Section J – “ Information and communication”;
- Section L – “Real estate activities”;
-Section M – “ Professional, scientific and technical activities”;
- Section N – “ Administrative and support service activities”;
-Group 95.1 – “ Repair of computers and communication 
equipment”
Enterprise size:Enterprises with 10 or more employees and self-employed persons
81.
Optional: enterprises with number of employees and self-employed 
persons between 0 and 9.
Geographic scope:
Enterprises located in any part of the territory of the country.
Reference period: Where not specified respondents should consider as reference their 
current situation (survey period in 2021).Year 2020 for the value or % of sales data and where specified.191
 ANNEX 5. EUROSTAT MODEL QUESTIONNAIRE ON ICT USAGE AND E-COMMERCE IN ENTERPRISES (2021)
Recommended survey period: First quarter 2021.
Questionnaire: The layout of the national questionnaire should be defined by the 
country. However, countries should follow the order of the list of 
variables enclosed, if possible. The background information (Module X) 
should be placed at the end of the questionnaire. This information can 
be obtained in 3 different ways: from national registers, from Structural 
Business Statistics or collected directly with the ICT usage survey. Every 
effort should be made to obtain them from the most recent SBS survey. 
Countries can include additional questions.
Target respondent: A decision maker with major responsibility for ICT-related issues in 
the enterprise (the ICT manager or a senior professional in the ICT 
department). In smaller enterprises, the respondent should be someone 
at the level of managing director or the owner. In any case the respondent 
should not be someone with responsibilities only in accounting.
Sample size, stratification: The sampling design and the resulting sample size should be 
appropriate for obtaining accurate, reliable and representative results 
on the variables and items in the model questionnaire.
This objective should be achieved for the overall proportions as well 
as for the proportions for the different breakdowns of the population 
defined below: NACE and size class. NACE breakdown and enterprise 
size class breakdown are not required to be cross-tabulated.
This requirement aims at ensuring the collection of a complete dataset 
– without empty, confidential or unreliable cells – for these indicators – 
with an exception for those broken down by economic activity for the 
calculation of European NACE aggregates.
NACE breakdown: (To be applied to: all variables; enterprises with 10 or more 
employees and self-employed persons; whole territory of the 
country.)

Disclaimer:   References to third-party brands, products and trademarks are for the sake of clarification and are not intended to 
promote the use of such products.Weighting of results: Results should in general be weighted by number of enterprises.
Turnover weighting should be used for sales related questions. 
Quantitative variables in the e-Commerce module related to sales 
should be weighted by total turnover.
Weighting by the number of employees and self-employed persons 
should be applied for variables related to questions A1, A4, A5, and 
for other variables e.g. % sending orders via a website or EDI-type 
messages, etc., as specified in the transmission format document.
Treatment of non-response/’Do not 
know’:Unit non-response:
The non-respondent units should be assumed to resemble those who 
have responded to the survey and be treated as non-selected units. 
For this, the weighting or the grossing up factors should be adjusted: 
the design weight Nh/nh is replaced by Nh/mh where Nh is the size of 
stratum h, nh is the sample size in stratum h and mh is the number of 
respondents in stratum h.
Item non-response:
Logical corrections should be made, when information can be deduced 
from other variables, and priority given to further contacts with 
enterprises to collect the missing information.
For the categorical variables (e.g. the YES/NO questions), respondents 
with item non response or ‘do not know’ should not be imputed with 
values from respondents who answered the question.
Numerical variables shouldn’t be imputed (see also Methodological 
Manual).
Tabulation of results: For the categorical variables, estimates should be made for the total 
number of enterprises for each response category, tabulated using the 
breakdowns specified above.
For the quantitative variables (turnover, sales and number of employees 
and self-employed persons), when collected in absolute or percentage 
terms (and not in percentage classes), estimates should be made for 
the total values in absolute terms, tabulated using breakdowns as 
specified in the transmission format document
Data transmission: Results are to be sent to Eurostat following the transmission format 
described in a forthcoming Eurostat document.UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 2020194

ANNEX 6. ESTIMATION OF A PROPORTION 
UNDER DIFFERENT SAMPLING SCHEMES
Many indicators are expressed as percentages or proportions of businesses satisfying a certain 
condition: using computers, using the Internet, having a website, etc. In statistical terminology, 
these indicators are estimates of a population proportion, defined as:
1. pNA=
where N is the number of businesses (units) in the population, and A is the number of businesses 
satisfying the given condition.
Different estimates for p are possible and the choice should be based on the design of the sample 
from which data are collected. Usually, statistical investigations will be designed to collect data 
from a sample of businesses and not from the total population. The target population will usually be 
segmented into strata,  defined by economic activity and size (and possibly geographical variables, 
such as head office location). Different sampling methods will yield different sampling errors  (with 
respect to the ‘true’ proportion p).
Every sampling method assigns unit weights  that reflect the number of population units represented 
by each sample unit. For an exhaustive survey (census) or stratum, weights are equal to one. 
The total number of firms (size of the target population or in-scope businesses) may be known (by 
the Statistical Business Register) or is estimated.
CASE 1.  Simple random sampling without replacement (SRSWOR) of a non-stratified 
population
In this case, n businesses out of N have been randomly selected with equal probability and without 
replacement (that is, a business cannot be selected twice to be interviewed). The sample weight 
is equal to w=N/n , that is, the sample is “grossed up” in proportion to the population size. The 
indicator may be calculated as the sample proportion:

where ai is a dichotomous variable that is 0 if the answer is “No” and 1 if “Yes”.
An unbiased estimate of the variance of the sample proportion is given by: 
3. ()()VpNNn
npp
11=-
--tttt
and therefore its standard error can be estimated by:
4. ()()SEpNNn
npp
11=-
--ttt207
Now, if N is much larger than n, that is to say the sampling fraction n/N is low, the estimated 
standard error given by (4) can be approximated by a simpler expression:
5. ()()SEpnpp1,-ttt
Note that an alternative approximation is given by dividing by n-1 instead of by n.
A sampling fraction of 10 per cent or less is a requirement for using expression (5).
CASE 2. Stratified random sampling
In stratified random sampling, the population is broken down into strata that are expected to 
be more homogeneous than the whole population with respect to the variable of interest. Every 
population unit must belong to one and only one stratum. Sample selection is done independently 
in each stratum, which will have a sampling fraction determined by factors such as stratum size, 
variability and significance.
Let L be the number of strata and let Nh and nh be the population and sample size respectively, in 
stratum h (h=1, 2, ... L).
An unbiased estimate of pNA=  is:

where ahi is a dichotomous variable that is 0 if the answer is “No” and 1 if “Yes”; and pht is an 
estimate of the proportion ph in stratum h, analogous to expression (2). The weight assigned to
each unit in stratum h is: wnN
h
hh=
Because sampling is independent between strata, and the estimate is a weighted sum of estimates, 
the sampling variance can be calculated as a weighted sum of variances.
The estimate of the standard error of pt is:
7. () () SEpNNVph
hL
h2

where ()Vp ht is the estimated variance of pht in stratum h and can be calculated as the square of 
expression (4) or (5), according to the size of the sampling fraction in each stratum.ANNEX 6. ESTIMATION OF A PROPORTION UNDER DIFFERENT SAMPLING SCHEMESUNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 2020208
CASE 2a. Stratified random sampling with one or several strata exhaustively investigated
One or more strata (for example, those containing large businesses) may be exhaustively sampled 
(that is, all units are selected). For those strata, there is no sampling error, and overall estimates of 
standard error need to take this into account. 
For simplicity, it can be supposed that just one stratum, the first, is exhaustively investigated. The 
general case is an easy extension of this.
An estimate of p is:

Note that the true proportion of stratum 1 is included in expression (8), but stratum 1 is omitted 
from expression (9).
In this case, the weight for any unit in stratum h is wnN
h
hh= , if h1! and w 1 1=
CASE 3. Ratio estimates with simple random sampling
Ratio estimates of a proportion can appear when the denominator of a proportion is not known and 
must be estimated from the sample. For example, the proportion of employees that have Internet 
access out of the total number of employees; or the ratio of the number of businesses that sell by 
Internet to the number of businesses that have Internet access.
For unit i, let yi and xi be the values of the characteristics that must be compared. For example, yi 
could be the number of employees that have Internet access and xi the total number of employees 
(or, for the second example, yi is 1 if it sells by Internet, and 0 otherwise; and xi is 1 if it has Internet 
access, and 0 otherwise). Thus, we are interested in estimating the following indicator:
10. pXYy

A natural estimate of p (let us call it rt to indicate that it is a ratio) is the sample version of expression

 ANNEX 6. ESTIMATION OF A PROPORTION UNDER DIFFERENT SAMPLING SCHEMES
This estimate is not unbiased, but, for most of the population, the bias will not be important if the 
sample size is reasonably large (usually, 20 or more units).
There is no unbiased estimate with a closed form of the standard error, but an expression that can 
be successfully used as an approximation is:

ANNEX 7. IMPUTATION OF MISSING DATA  
IN ICT SURVEYS 
If re-contacting the interviewed business is out of scope for cost or time reasons, item non-
response can be treated by mathematical techniques for data imputation. Imputation consists of 
assigning a plausible value to a question for which the selected unit has not provided a response, 
or to a question whose answer is logically or arithmetically inconsistent with answers in the rest of 
the questionnaire.
When the answer to different questions is inconsistent, the problem of deciding which one is 
incorrect may be very difficult. Usually, a hierarchy among questions, or blocks of questions, is 
established, so that answers to some of them are considered ‘dominant’.
The responses to questions A and B are inconsistent. However, it is more likely that the respondent 
made a mistake in question A) than in question B), because he or she was able to specify two web 
facilities. The most plausible conclusion is that his or her business had a website or home page, 
and therefore that question A) should be imputed as ‘Yes’.
It is important to recall that imputation does not intend to establish a ‘true’ answer, but to assign 
a value for a missing answer that is consistent with the rest of the questionnaire. Frequently used 
methods for data imputation in business surveys are: deterministic imputation, ‘hot deck’ and ‘cold 
deck’ techniques. The choice among them should be in accordance with the current practice for 
other business surveys in the statistical office, so these should be reviewed before selecting one 
method for surveys of ICT use.
Deterministic imputation
Deterministic imputation of missing data consists of assigning a valid answer by means of the 
application of fixed rules that relate questions’ values to each other. Under the same conditions, 
the mechanism will always generate the same imputed value.Example
Suppose the following two questions and responses are found in a questionnaire:
a)  Did your business have a website/home page, during January 
200X? Yes  No
b)  Did your website/homepage provide any of the following 
facilities, during January 200X?
a) Marketing the business’ products  Yes  No
b) Facilitating access to product catalogues and price lists  Yes  No
c) Providing after sales support  Yes  No
Example
A simple deterministic rule to assign a missing number of employees who use email is to assign the value of the 
number of employees who have access to the Internet, if the business uses email and 0 otherwise.211
Hot deck imputation
For each business with item non-response, the hot deck procedure searches a set of businesses 
with similar characteristics, called ‘donors’, that have responded to the item. The method consists 
of randomly selecting one of the donors and assigning the answer of the chosen donor to the 
business with item non-response.
The hot deck procedure is one of the most frequently used methods of imputation and its main 
operational problem is how to delimit the set of donors, i.e., which variables determine that two 
units are ‘similar’. A very restrictive rule will produce few donors (or none). The variables size and 
economic activity should generally be used to define similarity. Additionally, basic ICT variables 
such as the use of computer, use of Internet and presence of website should be used to identify 
donors where the missing answer relates to those variables (e.g., refer to the relationship in the 
example above where use, or not use, of Internet is used as a criterion for a donor).
This procedure tends to reduce the variance of the responses since by its own operational 
mechanism (replication of answers), it makes the sample more homogeneous. The bias towards 
homogeneity may be balanced by its simplicity. 
Cold deck imputation
The cold deck procedure is similar to hot deck imputation, except that the donors are not actual 
survey responses, but are logical combinations of responses that are constructed (often based 
on experiences learned from past surveys). The problems of this method include those of the hot 
deck method, but it also requires some information on which the construction of a donor table is 
based. Such information may not be available for those developing economies that are measuring 
ICT for the first time.ANNEX 7. IMPUTATION OF MISSING DATA IN ICT SURVEYS
Example
The following table shows some raw data from a survey on ICT use by businesses. Each row (register) represents 
a different business, and characteristics of the businesses are shown in the columns. ‘Missing’ means item non-
response. An imputed value for presence of a website for business 6 is sought.
Assume that two businesses are defined as ‘similar’ if they have the same level of Internet use (that is, they both 
used or did not use the Internet) and if their main activity is the same at the 3-digit level of ISIC. According to these 
criteria, in the example, business #6 is similar only to businesses #1, #2 and #5. Thus, businesses #1, #2 and 
#5 are donors for business #6, and one of them is randomly selected. If #1 is drawn, the value to the question 
‘Presence of a website’ for business #1 will be imputed to business #6 (that is, ‘Yes’). If #2 or #5 are drawn, ‘No’ 
will be imputed to business #6.

activityPresence of a

#1 Yes ABCD Yes 10%
#2 Yes ABCD No 15%
#3 No ABCD No 0%
#4 Yes ABXY No 25%
#5 Yes ABCD No 20%
#6 Yes ABCD Missing Missing
It is worth noting that if each donor has the same probability of being selected, then the relative frequencies of 
the imputed values will tend to replicate those of the valid values.UNCTAD Manual for the Production of Statistics on the Digital Economy 2020212
Other imputation techniques
Other imputation methods are mean (for quantitative variables) or modal (for qualitative variables) 
value imputation. The method consists of imputing the mean or the modal (i.e., most frequent) 
value of the set of donors.
A problem common to all imputation methods is in ensuring logical and arithmetic coherence of 
imputed values with other responses in the same questionnaire. For instance, the imputed value 
may be inconsistent with the response to another question. To avoid this situation, a check for 
validity can be made after each imputation, selecting another donor if necessary.
Another method of imputation is to assign the answer given by the same unit in a previous survey 
(historical imputation). The same principle can be applied to unit non-response. This technique 
would more frequently be applied to large businesses, because they are more likely to be in 
successive surveys. Example
Using raw data from the example above, and considering the same definition of similarity, the imputed value of 
percentage of employees with Internet access of business #6, would be 15% = (10%+15%+20%)/3 (the simple 
mean of the value for donors #1, #2 and #5).
In the example, if business #6 had responded that 10 per cent of its employees used computers, an imputed value 
of 15 per cent for the percentage of employees with Internet access could be considered contradictory.213
