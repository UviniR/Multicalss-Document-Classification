opportunity to achieve the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. Rapid technological change could contribute to many if not all of the Goals, 
especially those related to hunger (Goal 2), health (Goal 
3), education (Goal 4), gender equality (Goal 5), clean energy (Goal 7), industry, innovation and infrastructure (Goal 9), sustainable cities and communities (Goal 12) and climate change (Goal 13) (Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2018; UNCTAD, 2017a).
At the same time, rapid technological change poses 
new challenges for policymaking. It can outpace the 
capacity of Governments and society to adapt to the 
changes that new technologies bring about, as they can affect labour markets, perpetuate inequalities and raise ethical questions. These are questions highly relevant to Goal 8 (decent work and economic growth) and Goal 10 (reduced inequalities) (Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2018).
In recent years, there has also been growing interest 
by Member States to examine the impact of rapid 
technological change on sustainable development 
within the United Nations system. Discussions have been taking place in several forums, including the General Assembly, CSTD, the Multi-stakeholder Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation for the Sustainable Development Goals and various other 
regional and global workshops and expert group 
meetings.
This paper responds to General Assembly resolution 
72/242, which requests that CSTD, through the Economic and Social Council, to give due consideration to the impact of key rapid technological changes on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. CSTD seeks to deepen the understanding of the impact of rapid technological change on sustainable 
development, especially the consequences for the 
central principle of the 2030 Agenda of leaving no one behind, and the implications for the science, technology and innovation community. It examines the opportunities, risks and challenges brought about by rapid technological change and looks at the role 
of science, technology and innovation (STI) policy. It

Within the United Nations, the interest in new 
technologies is spurred by the opportunities of frontier technologies to address and monitor the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by world leaders in 2015, aims to ‚Äúleave 
no one behind‚Äù and therefore puts forward a broad and ambitious agenda for global action on 
sustainable development. The scale and ambition of the Sustainable Development Goals require new modalities for development, including bringing technology and innovation into the foreground of development strategies. Science, technology and innovation (STI) are not only an explicit focus of Goal 9 (Build resilient infrastructure, promote LQFOXVLYHDQGVXVWDLQDEOHLQGXVWULDOL]DWLRQDQGIRVWHU

could be transformative in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and creating more prosperous, sustainable, healthy and inclusive societies.
Recent decades have seen a dramatically accelerating 
pace in the development and adoption of new technologies, even though various gaps persist in 
terms of adoption in different parts of the world, 
especially in the least developed countries. This rapid technological change is affecting almost every area of the economy, society and culture. The Technology 
and Innovation Report 2018  (UNCTAD, 2018a) 
found that the pace of development and adoption of new technologies is likely to continue in the coming years. Frontier technologies are often at the centre RIGLVFXVVLRQV7KH\DUHFKDUDFWHUL]HGE\WKHLUUDSLGdevelopment (Fogel, 1999; Anthony, 2016; Simonite 2016) and great possibilities for combination based on

Chapter I introduces the concept of rapid technological 
change and discusses the growing interest by Member States to examine its impact on sustainable development. Chapter II presents the opportunities of rapid technological change for achieving as well as monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals. It examines how new and emerging technologies can contribute to the economic, social and environmental aspects of sustainable development. Chapter III discusses the transformative and disruptive potential of rapid technological changes, including economic, social and ethical considerations. Chapter IV analyses how technological change perpetuates or mitigates existing socioeconomic divides within and between countries.Chapters V and VI discuss strategies and policies. 
These chapters draw on a range of national and regional case studies on how policies can address rapid technological change. Chapter V looks at examples of national strategies and policies for rapid technological change, while chapter VI takes stock of regional, international and multi-stakeholder cooperation. It includes a focus on the role of international cooperation and recommendations to CSTD. Finally, chapter VII concludes with the key messages. 3 II. Opportunities of rapid technological change for sustainable development
II. OPPORTUNITIES OF RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE 
FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
Many countries and regions are harnessing rapid 
technological change to address economic, social, and 
environmental challenges. The UNCTAD secretariat 
sent out a questionnaire to all CSTD Member States and United Nations regional commissions soliciting inputs for case studies, lessons learned and best practices on the impact of rapid technological change 
in sustainable development. Eleven countries and 
three regional commissions replied with extensive case studies of applications covering nearly all of the Sustainable Development Goals (e.g. health; decent work and economic growth; industry, innovation and 
infrastructure; agriculture; education; and sustainable 
cities and communities) across a range of technologies HJDUWL∆ÑFLDOLQWHOOLJHQFH'SULQWLQJQDQRWHFKQRORJ\blockchain, biotechnology, big data and robotics). 
Based on the inputs provided and additional research 
conducted by the UNCTAD secretariat, this chapter provides examples of how rapid technological change can contribute to sustainable development.
A. ERADICATING POVERTY AND 
MONITORING PROGRESS IN ACHIEVING THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS
Ending poverty in all its forms (Goal 1) requires not only 
income but also ensuring that ‚Äúall men and women, 
in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services [‚Ä¶]‚Äù (target 1.4) and building ‚Äúthe 
resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations 
and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters‚Äù (target 1.5). Innovation and new technologies can contribute to 
eradicating poverty by raising living standards and 
FRQWULEXWLQJ WR HFRQRPLF GLYHUVL∆ÑFDWLRQ ,QWHUQHW RIthings-enabled devices and nanotechnology, for example, can be used to detect water contamination and purify water, while renewable energy technologies 
can provide electricity in rural areas far from the grid 
systems (see chapter II.B.4 and II.C). More accurate weather forecasts can make smallholder farmers more resilient (see chapter II.B.2). Foresight techniques, such as big data analysis, can help policymakers to identify 
trends and support urban planning, while information 
and communication technologies are being widely XVHGWRGHOLYHU∆ÑUVWUHVSRQVHHPHUJHQF\DLGDVZHOODV
to share information and provide early warning.
In addition, frontier technologies, including big data 
and machine learning, can also be used to create 
measures and develop and monitor the effectiveness of anti-poverty programmes and progress towards 
achieving the Sustainable Development Goals more broadly. Models based on both mobile phone activity 
and airtime credit purchases have been shown 
to estimate multidimensional poverty indicators 
accurately (United Nations Global Pulse, 2014), while recent studies have validated the potential of satellite 
imagery and machine learning to predict poverty, using publicly available and non-proprietary data (Jean et al., 2016). For example, researchers have predicted the wealth and economic shocks within the East 
African region based on mobile phone data collected 
from mobile operators in the region (Blumenstock et 
al., 2011). Economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have developed PriceStats, DQ LQQRYDWLYH SODWIRUP WKDW PHDVXUHV LQ∆ÖDWLRQ LQ}HFRQRPLHVRQDGDLO\EDVLVXVLQJRQOLQHSULFHVZKLFK FDQ KHOS SUHGLFW LQ∆ÖDWLRQ PRUH TXLFNO\ WKDQ

will continue to be as accurate as research and pilot 
projects suggest. While there are opportunities for big 
data to augment the evidence base for developing 
countries, where traditional statistics are scarce, some algorithms may increasingly develop out of sync with 
the underlying socioeconomic, health or environmental

B. IMPROVING FOOD SECURITY, NUTRITION 
AND AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT
About 795 million people, or every ninth person in 
the world, is undernourished, with the majority living in developing countries and rural areas. New, existing and emerging technologies can address the four dimensions of food security, namely, food availability, access, use and stability. For example, genetic PRGL∆ÑFDWLRQPHWKRGVIRULPSURYLQJVRLOIHUWLOLW\DQG4The impact of rapid technological change on sustainable development

1. Improving agricultural productivity

The Indian start-up CropIn provides analytics and software solutions for crop management and has developed a vegetation index using satellite images that provides support to farmers to ensure crop health (Singh, 2015). 
Drones also represent a potential leapfrogging 
opportunity for Africa in precision agriculture to more effectively measure and respond to variability in crop and animal production. Drones have several applications in precision agriculture, including, but not limited to, land tenure and land-use planning, cargo GHOLYHU\ VFLHQWL∆ÑF UHVHDUFK LQVSHFWLRQ PRQLWRULQJand surveillance, crop and infrastructure damage assessment, and management of agricultural assets. )RUH[DPSOHWKH7KLUG(\HSURMHFWLQ0R]DPELTXHused low-cost drones to help small-scale farmers LPSURYHFURSSURGXFWLRQE\}SHUFHQWDQGUHGXFHZDWHUXVHE\}SHUFHQW

process: the positive outcomes of the pilot project are not only a result of the application of drone technology but also the training of local drone operators, communication of relevant agronomic information to farmers and the widespread avail-ability of mobile phones, among other factors.Genetic sequencing, along with machine learning, is 
being used to detect soil quality and help increase crop quality.

2. Building resilience for farmers
New technologies are enabling novel early warning systems conferring unique predictive advantages. For example, Sweden-based Ignitia accurately predicts weather forecasts in tropical areas with a combination of algorithmic techniques based on convective processes, complex modelling of physics, and small (spatial and temporal) forecasting windows. The UHVXOWLVDUHSRUWHG}SHUFHQWDFFXUDF\UDWHRYHUtwo rainy seasons in West Africa (2013 and 2014), compared with other weather service providers with D}SHUFHQWUDWH,JQLWLD/RZFRVWGDLO\messages help farmers anticipate rainfall for the next 48 hours. In addition, the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture uses big data on weather and crops to better adapt to climate. Through its analysis during the last decade of big volumes of weather and crops data in Colombia, this initiative can predict upcoming changes in the climate. The projections help farmers to carry out sowing at the right time and thus prevent economic losses.

higher milk productivity and more nourished children 
(Jensen et al., 2015).
3. Monitoring food insecurity
Frontier technologies can also support initiatives to 
monitor food security and innovatively distribute food 
assistance. A study carried out by the World Food Programme used mobile data to assess food security. The results showed that airtime could serve as a proxy indicator for marketplace food expenditures. In addition, models based on both mobile phone activity and airtime credit purchases were shown to estimate 
multidimensional poverty indicators accurately (United 
Nations Global Pulse, 2014). Another programme coordinated by United Nations Global Pulse, the Government of Indonesia and the World Food Programme used public tweets mentioning food prices to develop a real-time food index (United Nations Global Pulse, 2018). The World Food Programme has 
also piloted the use of blockchain to carry out cash 
and food assistance in Jordanian and Syrian refugee camps, reducing overhead, improving security and speeding up aid (World Food Programme, 2017).

Furthermore, in Bangladesh, Internet of things data are being used to get a better understanding of the groundwater chemistry and protect tens of millions of people in the Ganges Delta that face the threat of drinking groundwater contaminated with arsenic (Zennaro et al., 2008).
5. Improving preservation of crops
Nanotechnology is being used in several projects to improve the preservation of crops (UNCTAD, 2017b). The Canadian International Food Security Research Fund and the International Development Research Centre support a programme to enhance WKH SUHVHUYDWLRQ RI IUXLWV LQ FROODERUDWLRQ ZLWK ∆ÑYHother countries: India, Kenya, Sri Lanka, Trinidad DQG7REDJRDQGWKH8QLWHG5HSXEOLFRI7DQ]DQLDIt aims to increase environmentally sustainable food security for poor people, especially small-scale farmers and women, through applied, collaborative, results-oriented research that informs development practice. A key part of the project involves hexanal, an affordable and naturally occurring compound produced by all plants to slow the ripening of soft fruits and extends their storage life.

Access to electricity plays a critical role not only for improving the lives of households but also in enabling new productive and income-generating activities in rural areas. The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy could be a catalyst for industrial development DQG VWUXFWXUDO FKDQJH LI EDFNHG E\ ∆ÑQDQFH DQGinvestment, technology transfer and other supportive measures to ensure adequate energy supply at reasonable costs. In the least developed countries particularly, such a transition requires overcoming LPSRUWDQW WHFKQRORJLFDO HFRQRPLF ∆ÑQDQFLDO DQGgovernance obstacles.
Several countries have strategies to promote the 
development of renewable energy technologies. Chile is developing the technologies to change the energy mix in the electricity sector through renewable energy, becoming a leading country to manage energy transition in the region.
8 The Government of Canada 
is also working to leverage the opportunity to be a leader in the clean technology sector by tackling the unique challenges that clean technology companies have related to access to long-term capital and both domestic and international markets. This includes WKH UHFDSLWDOL]DWLRQ RI 6XVWDLQDEOH 'HYHORSPHQWTechnology Canada to help Canadian innovators bring their ground-breaking clean technologies to market.

Energy demand can also be managed with the use of big data technologies. Smart grids can increase energy distribution and production by allowing households with solar panels on their roofs to feed surplus energy back into the electricity grid. The real-time information provided by smart grids help utility companies better respond to demand, power supply, costs and emissions, as well as avert major power outages (UNCTAD, 2015). For instance, Zenatix, a Delhi-based start-up, deploys smart meters and temperature sensors to monitor energy PHWHUV DQG KHOS KRXVHKROGV DQG RI∆ÑFHV UHGXFHenergy consumption through message-based alerts.

For countries with requisite technological capabilities, 
frontier technologies may support structural transformation, improved living standards, increased productivity, reduced production costs and prices and raise real wages.

New technologies enable large segments of 
populations in developing countries to innovate, coordinate and collaborate. Grass-roots innovation 
facilitates the involvement of grass-roots actors, 
such as social movements and networks of academics, activists and practitioners experimenting with alternative forms of knowledge creation and innovation processes (see %R[} ). For example, a 
fabrication laboratory established by the University of Nairobi has used 3D printing to develop a sanitation

innovative ways to coordinate by distributing work 
(e.g. gig economy and remote teams), building two-sided markets for the sharing economy (e.g. car and home sharing), developing open-source software 
DQG SURYLGLQJ SHUVRQDOL]HG GLJLWDO OHDUQLQJ ZLWKLQ
and outside established educational institutions (Van der Have and Rubalcaba, 2016). Digitally enabled open and collaborative innovation makes it possible 
to produce knowledge and technology across a 
multiplicity of actors and institutions, drawing from a large pool of both formal and informal knowledge. 
As a result, crowdsourcing provides new abilities to harness the ‚Äúwisdom of the crowd‚Äù to solve major challenges, create open knowledge and data sources (e.g. online encyclopedias and volunteered geographic information), and crowdfund new businesses, projects and philanthropic initiatives.

Frontier technologies hold promise for making public

WHU}VHFWLRQ(SStThe Technology and Innovation Report 2018
(UNCTAD, 2018a) reviews some of the recent estimations on the impact of automation on jobs. The results vary widely, depending on the assumptions made and the methodologies. Most of the studies only estimate job losses and do not consider job creation effects. For example, the World Bank estimates, that two thirds of all jobs could be susceptible to automation in developing countries in the coming decades. Estimates for the United States and Europe range between 50 
DQG}SHUFHQWRIMREV)XUWKHUGLJLWDODXWRPDWLRQ
may affect women and men differently. At the same time, it is worthwhile noting that machines and digital technologies are not perfect or even good 
substitutes for many tasks, at least not for the 
moment. Further, even if technologically feasible and economically reasonable, full automation 
of jobs takes time, even in developed countries 
(World Bank, 2016).
A recent study by the International Monetary Fund 
(Das and Hilgenstock, 2018) finds that although jobs in developing economies tend to be less 
exposed to automation, developed and developing 
countries have started to converge in this regard in the last decades. Consequently, automation can have important impacts on the economies of developing countries in the future, even if impacts may differ across countries. 
According to the global management consulting 
firm McKinsey (McKinsey Global Institute, 2017), within affluent countries, a variety of cognitive tasks 
are susceptible to displacement. But very few jobs 
}SHUFHQWRUOHVVDUHOLNHO\WREHFRPSOHWHO\displaced. Many jobs are likely to be transformed,

displacement. Based on this analysis, there may 
be more hollowing out of the income distribution, but work is not likely to disappear. Those working in the affected occupations in countries with lower 
gross domestic product (GDP) per capita are less 
likely to be affected by these changes. The reason is that the installation of artificial intelligence and 10The impact of rapid technological change on sustainable development
robotic systems only makes sense where labour 
costs are high. Where labour costs are low, firms are likely to continue to choose labour-intensive production processes. As long as the quality and final cost of the product compete well with robot-based systems, labour-intensive processes are likely to continue. 
UNCTAD (2017e) estimates that the use of 
industrial robots globally remains quite small and amounts to less than 2 million units. Robots are concentrated in the automotive, electrical and electronics industries, and in a small number of countries, such as Germany, Japan, the United States, China and the Republic of Korea. Routine tasks in manufacturing and service jobs are being replaced, but low-wage manufacturing jobs in areas such as clothing factories are left largely unaffected by automation. 
New technologies have been substituting workers 
only in specific tasks, but they have not replaced entire occupations. Rather than eliminating occupations, technology changes how jobs are performed, and the number of humans needed to carry them out. According to a recent study by Bessen (2016), only one out of the 260 occupations listed in the 1950 United States Census had been eliminated by 2010 due to automation, i.e. the elevator operator.
While digital platforms may create opportunities 
for smaller businesses and entrepreneurs in GHYHORSLQJ FRXQWULHV GLJLWDOL]DWLRQ PD\ DOVRpresent certain development challenges. Platform-based economies tend to have winner-takes-all dynamics, where network effects benefit first movers and standard setters. Despite the new opportunities for trade and development, these platform dynamics could lead to widening LQFRPH LQHTXDOLWLHV DQG LQFUHDVHG SRODUL]DWLRQThe evolving digital economy has also been accompanied by online labour platforms that provide new income-generating activities for people in developing countries with the requisite skills and digital connectivity. However, an oversupply of job seekers on online labour platforms could lead to diminished bargaining power, resulting in a race to the bottom with respect to wages and working conditions. Further research and policy dialogue will be critical in ensuring that the expanding digital economy provides quality and decent jobs, particularly in developing countries (UNCTAD, 2017a) (see %R[} ). Box 5. A legal framework for workers of the 
platform economy
The digital economy creates new job opportunities and 
contributes to the outsourcing of different business processes through online platforms or applications. Graham and Woodcock (2018) note however, that 
some of these practices can be harmful to digital 
workers (i.e. commercial content moderation) and may undermine standard employment relationships, and workers can lose their bargaining power due to strong global competition. Lacking the power to 
collectively bargain, platform workers have little ability 
to negotiate wages and working conditions with their employers. The Fairwork Foundation of the Oxford Internet Institute seeks to contribute to the welfare and job quality of digital workers. It highlights best 
and worst practices in the platform economy. Through

B. SOCIOECONOMIC DIVIDES
Rapid technological change has the potential to 
perpetuate existing divides within and between 
countries, as well as between women and men, 
rural and urban populations, and rich and poor communities (UNCTAD, 2018a). As recent data show, the share of Internet users in the total population of developed countries is more than four times as high 
as in the least developed countries. This digital divide 
may exacerbate the economic divergence between countries at the frontier of rapid technological change and the least developed countries. Even if frontier technologies provide leapfrogging opportunities, 
countries below the technological frontier may leapfrog 
primarily through the adoption of technologies rather than through the development of new technologies. In this regard, successful as it has been in many respects, $IULFDpV PRELOH UHYROXWLRQ DOVR GHPRQVWUDWHV WKH
limitations of leapfrogging by adopting technologies 
at the consumption rather than the production side. 'HVSLWH VSLOORYHU HIIHFWV DQG VLJQL∆ÑFDQW SRWHQWLDOZHOIDUHEHQH∆ÑWVWKHHFRQRPLFLPSDFWRILQIRUPDWLRQand communication technologies (ICTs) in sub-

The adoption of 11 III. Transformative and disruptive potential of rapid technological change
consumer ICT technologies, for example, cannot bring 
least developed economies close to the technological frontier without appropriate technological capabilities in other sectors and an enabling innovation system.
The increasing rate of technological change may 
widen existing gender digital and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) divides. Because women constitute low numbers in STEM job families, they may not be able to take advantage of the increased demand for workers with skills in frontier technologies. Additionally, automation can affect women and men differently, where women have been historically underrepresented in STEM job families that PD\ EHQH∆ÑW IURP WKH UHFHQW WHFKQRORJLFDO FKDQJHLQYROYLQJDXWRPDWLRQ:RPHQDUH}SHUFHQWOHVVOLNHO\WKDQPHQWRPDNHXVHRIWKH,QWHUQHWDQG}SHUFHQWless likely to do so in the least developed countries, widening the existing gender digital divide, which SHUVLVWVLQZRPHQpVDFFHVVWR,&7VDQGRSSRUWXQLWLHVto shape new and emerging technologies.
Recent work at CSTD brought attention to the concern 
that the lack of gender equality in science, technology and innovation leads to lost talent and potential and undermines the contribution of STI to the 2030 Agenda (UNCTAD, 2019a, 2019b). While some new and emerging technologies such as mobile money, microcredits and human papilloma virus vaccines have 
advanced gender equality, the lack of diversity among 
researchers and developers can lead to gender biases DQGXQDGGUHVVHGQHHGVWKDWDUHVSHFL∆ÑFWRZRPHQoften because of oversight. Differences between men and women may not be considered when testing safety features or drugs. This also means that technology developers might build their unconscious biases into technologies they develop. Recruitment tools using algorithms, for example, can operate based on the 
unconscious biases of developers. 
C. ETHICAL ISSUES AND CONSIDERATIONS
While frontier technologies offer unprecedented opportunities to transform the practice, implementation and monitoring of sustainable development, they also 
pose considerable ethical and bioethical concerns regarding the environment, privacy, security, data ownership and use, and safety. For example, smart energy-meter technologies can use sophisticated statistical algorithms to determine sensitive household information like which appliances or devices a household might have and when it is operating. Data 
collected from health trackers and wearables and electronic health records that are disclosed to third parties could potentially impact insurance policies or even future employment prospects.
Biased big data may produce unintended and

Policymakers need to consider the potential of these technologies to address major challenges in agriculture and medicine, as well as the risks involved.

IV. RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND
LEAVING NO ONE BEHIND
When individuals experiment with new ways of 
PHHWLQJWKHLUQHHGVDQGZKHQFRPPXQLWLHVRUJDQL]Hthemselves for larger and larger goals, they often improve technologies in the process. Businesses, however, survive and thrive on competitive advantage, and this need is often met in the industrial era through technological innovation. Innovations in the process of producing goods and services lower costs and increase productivity (Fagerberg et al., 2006). For example, mass production has lowered the costs of many products. Power tools allow more construction 
in the same amount of time. Smart ride-hailing systems 
PDWFKULGHUVDQGGULYHUVPRUHHI∆ÑFLHQWO\,QQRYDWLRQVin products themselves sometimes maintain or increase market share and sometimes create whole 
new markets, as when the xerox machine replaced 
carbon paper copying or where mobile phones displace landlines.

Regions that attract innovators reap WKHEHQH∆ÑWVRIWKRVHFRPPHUFLDOHIIRUWV&RRNHHWDO1997). The more radical the innovation, the more likely 
it is that it will bring wealth to those who bring it to 
market, since they will have a temporary monopoly on its capabilities (Schumpeter, 1950). Technology-
based wealth thus tends to pile up through a process

(Figure 1) shows (Lakner and Milanovic, 2015).
Emerging technologies also have the potential to 
contribute to inequalities. Many economists see the main dynamic in high-income countries as skill-biased WHFKQRORJLFDOFKDQJH6%7&$V∆ÑUPVLQWURGXFHQHZtechnologies into their production processes, demand rises for higher skills in the workforce. A wage premium develops for higher-skilled workers, and a gap opens between the earnings of lower-skilled and higher-skilled workers. Skill-biased technological change is most visible 
in the gap in earnings between college and high-school 
graduates in the United States and their equivalents in other countries. This gap has been increasing and accounts for about two thirds of the increase in income inequality in the United States over the period since 1980 (Autor, 2014). Furthermore, empirical and theoretical studies have also demonstrated SBTC as contributing to wage inequality in developing countries (Goel 2017; Torres et al., 2017; Pi and Zhang, 2018).
Technological change may have different impacts on 
different age groups, as well as men and women. For example, older workers displaced by technological change will not qualify for jobs requiring skills they never acquired. Weak educational systems may not prepare young people for emerging employment opportunities, and disadvantaged social groups, including women in many countries, often have fewer opportunities for

skill, high-wage jobs, but relatively few of them. As the 
high-wage workers spend their earnings in the local 
economy, lower-wage services jobs are generated. In 
countries with generally high education levels, many people have the right levels of skills for the jobs, and compensation goes up gradually. However, in countries with generally low education levels, where 
only a few people have the right skills, the people who get these jobs may also receive hyperwages, raising the top end of the income distribution dramatically. The more global the industry, the more likely this is 
to occur. When combined with high unemployment 
levels that keep service wages down, the spending by the high-end individuals will not bring much prosperity to the poorest.

manufacturing or service employment are likely to 
experience growing inequality between urban and rural 
areas and between core and peripheral regions. China 
illustrates this pattern. Its level of inequality is about the same as that of the United States. But differences 
between regions explain much more of the inequality 
in China rather than difference between individuals, as in the United States (Milanovic, 2005). Technological innovation is almost always and everywhere an urban phenomenon, particularly where the local network of expertise accelerates the process, as for example in 
Bangalore, India (Pal and Ghosh, 2007).

Middle-income countries can use incremental

the distributional dynamics of the global economy by shifting both market and production power outwards 
from the core. 
Disruptive technological change brings both 
opportunities and threats. The information technology revolution, starting in the 1970s, called for rapid expansion of new manufacturing capacity. The ‚ÄúAsian tigers‚Äù moved into this opportunity space and occupied the new niche. Taiwan Province of China, for example, became a major site for semiconductor manufacturing %UH]QLW]2QWKHRWKHUKDQGPDQ\IHDUWKDWWKH

of HIV/AIDS remained out of reach for many years in lower-income countries because of cost, at least for people of modest income who depended on public health services to provide them. But assertive uses of patent law provisions and an international 
humanitarian movement brought the prices down 
(Butler, 2007). In another example, lack of facilities DQGWUDLQHGSHRSOHNHSWVPDOOIDUPHUVLQ0R]DPELTXH

outside the country resulted in the development of technology research, development and diffusion 
capacities (Brito et al., 2012). Likewise, competition

they keep disadvantaged groups in view.
C. POTENTIAL OF RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL 
CHANGE TO ‚ÄúLEAVE NO ONE BEHIND‚Äù
The threats and opportunities of rapid technological 
change are well illustrated in the emergence of the fourth industrial revolution, the convergence of digitally enabled technologies that may be ushering in a new technoeconomic paradigm. Some of the links between Industry 4.0 and inequalities are likely to be similar to those experienced during earlier techno-economic revolutions, and others are likely to be particular to this 
convergence. The dynamics described in this chapter 
draw attention to both. 
First, emerging technological regimes tend to appear 
threatening at the beginning (Weart, 2012). This is particularly true during the period when technological 
visionaries are painting the future in the starkest 
terms. Many of the most drastic changes never come 
about or have been tamed in their consequences by the time they do, and other profound transformations

ZHUHQRWDQWLFLSDWHGLQWKH∆ÑUVWVWDJH.ULHFKEDXPet al., 2018).
Second, based on the experience of past emerging 
technologies, Industry 4.0 will expand, evolve and 
spread in unexpected ways as the innovations 
GLIIXVH 1HZ HQWUHSUHQHXUV ZLOO ∆ÑQG QHZ XVHV LQeither product or process form, to reach a variety of 
goals (Bortagaray et al., 2014). The more disruptive 
the pathway the technoeconomic paradigm follows, 15 IV. Rapid technological change and leaving no one behind
the more unpredictable the applications. Regarding 
Industry 4.0, disruptive effects have already appeared LQVHYHUDOVHFWRUVLQFOXGLQJUHWDLOLQJHJ$PD]RQand transportation (e.g. Uber). Furthermore, there is little evidence that the hybrid jobs that have appeared, dependent both on personal services and digital connections, are being compensated highly (for evidence among ride-hailing drivers, see Berger et al., 2018 and Zwick, 2018).
Third, there are likely to be differential effects by gender. 
6HYHUDORFFXSDWLRQVLGHQWL∆ÑHGDVOHVVYXOQHUDEOHWRdisplacement by robotics are those in which women predominate, such as day care and social work. It is probably premature, however, to declare that men will become the disadvantaged group of the future, especially considering the gender divides created by the underrepresentation of women in STEM job families. Likewise, the informal economy is not a likely SODFHIRUURERWLFVDQGDUWL∆ÑFLDOLQWHOOLJHQFHWRDIIHFWjobs; perhaps it will even grow if the expensive new technologies raise prices in the formal economy. In 
terms of urban, rural and regional distributions, some applications are rather place-based (such as robotic systems in manufacturing), while others take place in cyberspace (such as data-based marketing). The ODWWHUPLJKWOHDGWRJURZLQJVSDWLDOGHFHQWUDOL]DWLRQUDWKHUWKDQFHQWUDOL]DWLRQ
Finally, as in previous techno-economic revolutions, 
new institutions will be needed to counter inequality and restore social cohesion. Just as the physical concentration of workers in the industrial revolution IDFLOLWDWHG RUJDQL]LQJ DQG XQLRQL]DWLRQ VRFLDOPHGLDPD\PDNHRUJDQL]LQJSRVVLEOHLQGLVWULEXWHGworkforces (Glenn, 2015; Alang, 2016). Public social safety nets may be implemented through universal basic income schemes (Perkio, 2015; Reich, 2018). Corporations transformed by activist investors may make social responsibility a central function.

than they need, leading to bumping down, that is, 
people taking jobs below their skill levels. Raising educational levels in the overall population, then, is always a good thing, but does not necessarily solve 
employment challenges. 
This observation is particularly true when the 
number of jobs shifts suddenly, as can happen when automation arrives (Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 
2014). At such moments, displaced workers need temporary income support and targeted retraining (Centre for the New Economy and Society, 2018). 
In addition, the economy must be dynamic enough 
that new floors and offices are available for them to 
occupy. In the long term, most economists expect that as technological revolutions eliminate old jobs innovation creates new industries and employment 
(Autor, 2015). National innovation-supporting 
strategies facilitate these. Individuals who are prepared to step into these new opportunities will move forward rather than being left behind.

technology and innovation policies that could

regions that have innovation capabilities already.

Policies, however, can create countercurrents in this pattern by focusing on investments that spread capabilities 
more broadly and stimulate innovation with and for 
groups at the margins. 
Strengthening national educational systems is a 
common recommendation for effective response 
to rapid technological change (Romer, 1990).

Firms are at the core of innovation systems, which 
also encompass research and education systems, 
government, civil society and consumers.
1. Building capabilities, connections and 
an enabling environment
The key aspects that policymakers might want to 
focus on are the capabilities of the various actors, the connections among them that facilitate exchanges and collaborations, and the enabling environment for innovation that is created (UNCTAD, 2018a). In developing countries with nascent innovation systems, building endogenous innovation potential involves developing a basic capacity to learn how to adopt, assimilate, adapt and diffuse existing knowledge and technologies. These capabilities DUH UHTXLUHG WR EHQH∆ÑW IURP WHFKQRORJ\ WUDQVIHUVwhich should supplement efforts to build domestic innovation potentials. 
The connections among actors are equally essential 
for the facilitation of learning, technology adoption 
and the development of new technologies. This 
requires networking and collaboration capabilities 
among all actors. In countries with an underdeveloped 
knowledge base, government and non-government actors can step in to develop capacities and domestic OLQNV DQG IDFLOLWDWH UHODWLRQV ZLWK IRUHLJQ ∆ÑUPV DQG
research centres. National Governments can 
encourage the development of such linkages. Very 
few countries try to develop such systems generically, 
covering all disciplines and technological areas. Most 
work on developing the connections takes place within 
sectors that are chosen strategically, either because of 
WKHLUFRQQHFWLRQWRSXEOLFJRDOVOLNHWKRVHUH∆ÖHFWHG
in the Sustainable Development Goals, or in business sectors where the country has strengths. These actions form sectoral innovation systems (Malerba, 
2004). 
For example, in the water and sanitation sector

innovation system, national Governments could 
consider taking the following actions:
‚Ä¢ Support training programmes that supply local 
water systems with appropriate experts. 
‚Ä¢ Link personnel in public systems to professional associations outside the country, to draw on 
international best standards and raise awareness of technological options.‚Ä¢ 5HFRJQL]HDQGUHZDUGXSJUDGLQJLQZDWHUV\VWHP

Furthermore, an effective innovation system requires 
attention to key elements of an enabling environment. STI policymakers could consider addressing the following issues:
‚Ä¢ 'HYHORSLQJ LQIUDVWUXFWXUH ZLWK D VSHFL∆ÑFemphasis on providing access to electricity and connectivity; ensuring affordable access to ICTs;

managerial competencies.
‚Ä¢ Developing human capital, both technical and soft skills, through an inclusive and strong technical and vocational education system.

support sustainable technologies
Green public procurement promotes the use of 
environmentally friendly, innovative and sustainable technologies in the manufacturing of goods. In 
Latvia, green public procurement is encouraged 
by a regulatory framework, namely the Public Procurement Law and, in particular, the Regulation 
on Requirements for Green Public Procurement and Procedures for Application of the Cabinet of Ministers 
that establishes requirements and criteria for certain 
groups of products and services, based on innovative 
and environmentally friendly technological solutions and approaches. The application of these principles 
is aimed at all societal groups. The greatest challenge for the introduction of green procurement principles 
in public procurement lies in the concerns raised by 
procurement agents about the increased complexity 
and expenses. However, in this context it is essential to evaluate the product life-cycle costs in their entirety.

To be effective, STI policies need to be internally 
consistent and aligned with national priorities and development plans. The former can be promoted 
through the design and deployment of strategies 
and policy instruments at the most appropriate level, 
while the latter requires a whole-of-government 
perspective, facilitating cooperation across ministries DQGRWKHUSXEOLFERGLHVLQGLIIHUHQW∆ÑHOGVRISROLF\19 V. National strategies and policies
Coherence is needed between STI policies and policy 
areas such as industrial policies, trade, foreign direct investment (knowledge and technology are often being transferred through trade and foreign direct investment), education and competition. 
2. Promoting sustainable innovation 
policies
Countries seeking to orient STI policies towards 
sustainable development need to integrate societal challenges into their cores (UNCTAD, 2018a). Stark DQGJURZLQJGLIIHUHQFHVEHWZHHQLQGXVWULDOL]HGXUEDQareas and agricultural regions, with steep gaps in income, health and education, have led some national Governments to work to reduce regional inequalities through their investment in science, technology, DQG LQQRYDWLRQ 'MH∆ÖDW DQG &XPPLQJV Colombia has set the conditions for more regional development of innovation capabilities with its general system of royalties (OECD, 2014). Regional and local governments are trying to use the power of interaction through innovation systems to grow their place-based economic opportunities. Local systems of innovation and production can contribute to regional prosperity (Matos et al., 2016).
Gender-inclusive innovation policies may be directed at

Technical and vocational training may be a means of empowering women to play roles in new technological sectors (Hemson and Peek, 2017). Involving women in how new technologies are implemented affects their HYHQWXDOLPSDFWDVSRVLWLYHRUQHJDWLYHLQZRPHQpVlives (Hansda, 2017).
Youth-oriented policies can also be helpful in making 
technological change inclusive. Some countries have developed special school programmes to increase interest in new technologies, particularly focused on entrepreneurship (du Toit and Gaotlhobogwek 2018; Wensing et al., 2018). Some initiatives are focused on unleashing creativity (Muraveva et al., 2017), while museums are often used as venues for inspiring youth to pursue technology careers and exposing them to 
role models (Marx, 2017). Special efforts must be made to reach young people who are neither in school nor working (Ospina, 2018).
Innovation in informal settings is also drawing attention

Small, informal crafts-based businesses can play a major role in adapting external innovations to ORFDOFRQGLWLRQVDQG∆ÑOOLQJWKHJDSZKHQSURGXFWLRQsystems change (Muller, 2010).

13 National policies can make room 
for informal innovators, even though they are often operating outside standard regulations, to protect their new ideas from exploitation (Kraemer-Mbula and Wunsch-Vincent, 2016). Universities can expand their technical capabilities to these enterprises through extension services (Mytelka and Farinelli, 2000).
Other policies may include regulations and standards 
relating to the environment or health; economic and ∆ÑQDQFLDOLQVWUXPHQWVVXFKDVIHHGLQWDULIIVRUWKHremoval of subsidies for unsustainable activities; demand support through public procurement; education and training policies supporting inclusiveness and life-long learning or capacity-building and information sharing, both locally and internationally (UNCTAD, 2018a).

Digital competencies include technical

skills, but also generic and complementary skills to be 
able to understand media, search for information, be critical about what is retrieved, and communicate with a variety of digital tools and applications (UNCTAD, 2018b). 
Different types of digital skills are needed to adapt 
to new technologies. Four levels of digital skills are needed during the adoption, use and domestication of technologies. A distinction can be made between skills required for the adoption of technologies (involves basic education, literacy and familiarity with technology devices), those needed in the basic use of technologies (involves understanding of new technologies, knowledge of digital rights, privacy and security, ability to use digital technologies to collaborate and create), those necessary for the creative use and adaptation of technologies (involves basic computing skills and familiarity with algorithms) and those essential for the creation of new technologies (sophisticated programming skills and knowledge of complex algorithms) (UNCTAD, 2018b).
As many frontier technologies are designed to be 
used in contexts with developed infrastructure and abundant natural and social resources, developing countries need to have appropriate skills to introduce PRGL∆ÑFDWLRQVWRQHZWHFKQRORJLHV +XDQJDQG3DOYLD

and %R[  . Other types of competencies vary 
across sectors, countries and industrial development. In countries where technology development remains in its early stages, basic technical skills and generic skills are the most required. Countries where the manufacturing sector dominates economic growth will UHTXLUHDZRUNIRUFHZLWKVSHFLDOL]HGVNLOOVLQURERWLFVautomation and the Internet of things. Digital policies should also support cross-sectoral collaboration both within government and with other stakeholders to address a wide spectrum of policy areas.

A good example of providing STEM education 
for underrepresented groups is the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Secondary Transition to Employment Programme. The initiative connects USGS scientists with young adults with cognitive and other disabilities (ages between 18 and 22) who are enrolled in workforce training programmes. These young adults particularly enjoy and excel at repetitive and routine tasks that are data- and detail-oriented. They have analysed 49,000 images for the iCoast project, transcribed over 27,000 handwritten bird phenology cards from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, recorded over 90,000 wildlife time-lapse images and scanned over 500,000 bird banding laboratory sheets.

the United States, 2018.
Recent work by CSTD suggests that addressing 
gender digital divides in accessing, using and developing new and emerging technologies requires more and better data and a society-wide discussion to better understand underlying issues (UNCTAD, 2019). It is important that policymakers, academia and private sector stakeholders incorporate gender considerations from the inception phase of their policies, projects and products. While some countries and regions struggle to attract more girls to STEM-UHODWHG∆ÑHOGVRWKHUVKDYHGLI∆ÑFXOW\WRUHWDLQRUSURPRWHwomen to leadership roles. Therefore, a nuanced policy approach is needed.
Box 14. Policies for an empowering digital 
environment for women and girls
The World Wide Web Foundation provides a policy 
framework with a list of policy steps needed to close the digital gender gap and ensure full digital inclusion. An initiative called REACT focuses on rights, education, access, content and targets to close the gender digital divide. It recommends that policymakers should protect and enhance rights online; equip everyone, especially women, with adequate skills to effectively use the Internet; provide affordable access 24The impact of rapid technological change on sustainable development
to the Internet; ensure that relevant content for women 
is available and used; and set and measure tangible gender-equity targets.
While digital technologies have the potential to be used 
in transformative ways to empower women and girls and advance gender equality, they have also enabled new forms of violence against women and girls. Although there is no comprehensive data, in a recent VXUYH\FDUULHGRXWLQWKH(XURSHDQ8QLRQ}SHUFHQWof women have reported having experienced some sort of online harassment since the age of 15. Women are also disproportionately targeted by online violence and suffer disproportionately serious consequences as a result. To address cyberviolence against and abuse of women and girls, Canada developed the Playbook for Gender Equality in the Digital Age. This playbook outlines a set of best practices for a multi-stakeholder approach to ensure a positive and empowering digital environment for all. It covers four broad areas: access, culture, education and an international framework.

E. STRENGTHENING CAPACITY FOR 
TECHNOLOGY FORESIGHT AND ASSESSMENT
If societies are to cope better with the accelerated 
pace and broadened scope of technological change, policymakers will need to develop plans based on technological foresight and an assessment of potentially disruptive effects of technology over years and even decades. Foresight involves bringing together key agents of change and sources of knowledge to develop strategic visions and intelligence to shape the future. Developing capacity in technology IRUHVLJKWHJKRUL]RQVFDQQLQJDQGH[DQWHLPSDFWassessments) can enable countries to identify and exploit the potential of frontier technologies for sustainable development, identify priority technologies in the short, medium and longer term and assess the potential effects of emerging technologies. There are also important implications for the methodologies and types of evidence needed to support policy and implementation, for example combining methodologies and data for technological, economic, social and environmental impacts in assessment of the environmental impacts of innovation. 
United Nations Member States are increasingly

can be addressed strategically (resolution 2017/22). In its most recent resolution on STI for development (resolution 2018/29) the Council encouraged Governments to undertake systemic research for foresight exercises, on new trends in STI in ICTs in their 
impact on development, particularly in the context 
of the 2030 Agenda and to consider undertaking 
strategic foresight initiatives on global and regional 
challenges at regular intervals and cooperate towards the establishment of a mapping system to review and 
share technology foresight outcomes. At the same 
time, the latest General Assembly resolutions on STI for development (resolution 72/228) and on the impact 
of rapid technological change on the achievement 
of the Sustainable Development Goals (resolution 72/242) encourage Member States to continue 
considering the impact of rapid technological change 
and to conduct technology assessment and foresight activities to evaluate their development potential and 
mitigate potential negative effects. Countries could explore ways and means of conducting national, 
regional and international technology assessments 
and foresight exercises.

developments and draw out their implications for

how emerging technologies, such as blockchain 1HOVRQDQGDUWL∆ÑFLDOLQWHOOLJHQFH3DXO
affect development, in both positive and negative 
ways. USAID is partnering with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and others to further research 
on how to mitigate issues of bias and unfairness that arise in low- and middle-income country contexts.

countries. The United States National Institutes of Health, for example, sponsor international collaborative 
projects through the Fogarty International Centre, and 
the European Union welcomes other countries into most of its research programmes.
Another good example of international collaboration 
in research on frontier technologies is the work of the High-level African Panel on Emerging Technologies. 
The panel was appointed in 2016 by the African 
Union Commission to give recommendations on how Africa should harness emerging technologies. 
The panel has recently published three reports on 
three key technologies, including gene drives (for malaria control and elimination), drones (to transform

communities and enable transformation).Intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder efforts to 
strengthen digital capabilities can provide avenues for refocusing and strengthening international cooperation for innovation in frontier technologies. However, support by the international community, including regional and international cooperation, will need to expand to prevent the evolving digital economy from leading to widening digital divides and greater income equalities. According to OECD, the annual baseline average official development assistance for ICT was around $500 million globally. Between 2006 and 2015, this amount was between $650 million and $700 million, representing a small share in total aid efforts.

The online education platform Fast.ai offers free classes on deep learning with the aim of increasing diversity in AI. The platform has launched diversity and international fellowships for deep learning, providing an opportunity for participants to receive state-of-the-art practical education in AI (Fast.ai, 2018).

C. UNITED NATIONS AND COMMISSION 
ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR DEVELOPMENT
In recent years, there has been growing interest by 
Member States in examining the impact of rapid technological change on sustainable development within the United Nations system. Discussions have been taking place in several forums. In 2017, the United Nations General Assembly passed a Resolution on the impact of rapid technological change on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (resolution 72/242), and recently in 2018, a resolution on the impact of rapid technological change on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and targets (resolution 73/17). In response to this, CSTD and the Multi-stakeholder Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation for the Sustainable Development Goals held dedicated sessions on the impact of rapid technological change in 2018. Other initiatives include two expert group meetings in Mexico (in 2016 on exponential technological change, automation, and their policy implications for sustainable development,
32 and in 2018 on

automation and policy implications33). Regional 
commissions are also contributing to a better understanding of the impact of rapid technological change through expert meetings (such as the recent PHHWLQJRQIRXUWKLQGXVWULDOUHYROXWLRQRUJDQL]HGE\the Economic Commission for Europe
34) and analytical 
work on the regional applications and best practices in supporting frontier technologies (Economic and 6RFLDO&RPPLVVLRQIRU$VLDDQGWKH3DFL∆ÑFand 2018; Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, 2018). Furthermore, the Secretary-General of the United Nations has recently published a United Nations-system-wide strategy on new technologies
35 and established a high-level panel 
on digital cooperation to raise awareness about the transformative impact of digital technologies and contribute to the broader public debate.
36 Across 
the United Nations system, agencies, forums and initiatives can support Member States through capacity-building activities, technology foresight and assessment, and norm-setting and consensus-building.

2. Technology foresight and assessment
There is need for technology foresight and assessment to better understand the impact of frontier technologies and to identify approaches that can leverage them to accelerate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals in all countries and leave no one behind. Platforms such as CSTD and the Multi-stakeholder Forum on Science, Technology and Innovation for the Sustainable Development Goals, as well as initiatives such as WKH6HFUHWDU\*HQHUDOpV+LJKOHYHO3DQHORQ'LJLWDOCooperation, contribute to the broader public debate on how to ensure a safe and inclusive digital future for all. CSTD can also support and showcase good examples of international, regional and national technology foresight exercises and assessments.

and safety support the targeted development of national capability in areas of rapid technological change. For nanotechnology, concerns about the occupational and environmental risks of nanoscale particles posed a challenge to the early development of applications. International RUJDQL]DWLRQVVWHSSHGLQWRWKHLQIRUPDWLRQJDSDQGbegan to collate and evaluate the available data for specific product groups.
38 Because of the ongoing 
dialogue at the international level, countries such as South Africa did not need to mount their own testing programmes, nor depend entirely on expertise from specific countries. However, they could address potentially unequal risks through international best practices. 
Furthermore, global consensus could identify a set 
of technological innovations that will be most critical for achieving health-, sanitation- and environment-related goals of the 2030 Agenda and facilitate access to and use of these technologies by all countries and communities. Targeting research funding towards Sustainable Development Goal-related projects, PDSSLQJ H[LVWLQJ VFLHQWL∆ÑF NQRZOHGJH DQG FXUUHQWresearch against local needs and building technological capabilities through national and international efforts can ensure that these mission-critical innovations serve the 2030 Agenda.

Rapid technological change also poses new challenges 
for policymaking, threatening to outpace the capacity of Governments and society to adapt to the changes that new technologies bring about. Automation could have an impact on employment, productivity, JOREDOL]DWLRQDQGFRPSHWLWLRQLQXQFOHDUDQGSRWHQWLDOO\negative ways. Rapid technological change also has the potential to perpetuate existing divides among and between countries and raise ethical issues involving privacy, security, data stewardship and safety.
Although the global dynamics of technological 
change have the potential to increase socioeconomic divides, policies can support investments that spread 
capabilities more broadly and stimulate innovation with and for groups at the margins.
National strategies harnessing rapid technological 
change for sustainable development involve building and managing effective innovation systems.

Intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder efforts to 
strengthen digital capabilities can provide avenues for refocusing and strengthening international cooperation for innovation in frontier technologies. 1RUWKt6RXWK 6RXWKt6RXWK DQG WULDQJXODUcooperation, initiatives by academic, technical, business and civil society communities, and United Nations system-wide efforts can play a role in ensuring that rapid technological change leaves no one behind.30The impact of rapid technological change on sustainable development
