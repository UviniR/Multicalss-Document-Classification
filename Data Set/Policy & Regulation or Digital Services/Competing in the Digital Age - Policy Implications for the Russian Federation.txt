FOREWORD  ix
We live in an era of digital transformation. Digital technologies, the data they generate and 
the connections they enable are changing the way we live, learn, work and play, plan, think 
and make decisions. The accelerating pace of technological change is not only increasing 
risks and threatening established business models but also creating new opportunities at 
all levels of government, business and social development. Policy-makers must find new 
ways to manage economic and social change caused by digital adoption whilst enabling 
the potential for growth which digital technologies unleash. This is not simple. The nature 
and impact of this transformation is still evolving.
The Report, Competing in the Digital Age: Policy Implications for the Russian Federation, 
is a result of a two-year global exercise between the World Bank’s global community of 
specialists and Russian experts. This collaborative network identified and analyzed current 
global best practices in digital transformation spanning a broad spectrum of business and 
government issues, policies and approaches. It then explored ways to apply these global 
insights locally. The resulting Report includes an analysis of international policies aiming to 
stimulate digital adoption whilst being alert to the disruption caused by new business mod -
els and the rapid emergence of new technologies. This collaboration looked at a number of 
trends, such as the emergence of digital platforms, as well as considered the transformation 
taking place in government, business, and the importance of policy in innovation, skills and 
employment, from a digital perspective. 
There are several fundamental factors affecting the digitalization and growth of the econ -
omy that this Report explores:
 ●Strengthening the non-digital foundations of the economy, including digital leadership; 
ensuring an agile and enabling regulatory environment, as well as assisting the general 
population, decision-makers, institutions and organizations to adapt to the digital world

 ●Strengthening the digital foundations, ensuring there is a scalable, intelligent, secure 
infrastructure capable of responding to the anticipated substantial demand for the digital 
economy.
 ●Strengthening the interactions, integration and operations of the digital ecosystem - 
horizontally across industries and sectors, and vertically across all government jurisdic -
tions - in order to support innovation and technological breakthroughs envisioned by the 
Russian leadership.
 ●Boosting digital skills to support a thriving digital economy and developing a highly-
trained workforce. 
 ●And finally, the interdependency between digital advancement, open innovation and the 
cultural transformation of traditional governance structures, and how to (re)shape the 
environment accordingly. 
We hope that this Report assists policy-makers as they think through the many ways to 
adapt to and harness the opportunities created by digital and emerging technologies to 
boost Russia’s global competitiveness by accelerating its pace of digital transformation.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  xi

INTRODUCTION  xix
INTRODUCTION
1 The development of the methodology and the assessments were co-financed by Smart Nations and Digital Development 
Partnership grants.
2 The community is hosted by the Facebook Group “Digital Economy in Russia.” To date, this group has over 3,400 actively 
engaged members, and many regularly post and comment in the community space and attend the digital economy-related 
events organized by the World Bank and its partners, both online and offline.This report was prepared as the final output of “Developing the Digital Economy in Russia” 
initiative—a joint effort of the World Bank and a number of Russian partner organizations to 
establish a multi-stakeholder collaboration to foster the development of the digital economy 
in the Russian Federation.
In recent years, digitization of the economy in Russia has been a top priority at the highest 
level of leadership, and a number of digital initiatives have been implemented in the coun -
try at the national and subnational levels. Russia has also been driving the development of 
the common digital space in the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU).
In June 2016, the former Russian Minister of Telecom and Mass Communications, Nikolay 
Nikiforov, expressed his interest in collaborating with the World Bank on the develop-
ment of the national Digital Economy Strategy. In October 2016, the Eurasian Economic 
Commission (EEC) invited the World Bank to collaborate on the EAEU Digital Agenda 
development.
In response to the minister’s invitation, the World Bank team proposed the “Developing the 
Digital Economy in Russia” initiative, whose main goal was to support national and sub-
national stakeholders in Russia in developing a strong future-proof digital foundation for 
the country’s economy by drawing on international best practices and local expertise. The 
initiative was also aimed to operationalize the findings and recommendations of the World 
Development Report 2016: Digital Dividends and to adapt them to the country context.
To achieve this ambitious goal, the World Bank team partnered with the government coun-
terparts and several leading Russian think tanks and mobilized expertise of the World Bank-
facilitated “High-Level Experts, Leaders, and Practioners” (HELP) network. The initiative 
was announced in November 2016 during the Smart Russia International Congress at the 
Plekhanov University of Economics and was officially launched on December 20, 2016, dur-
ing the seminar that was held at the World Bank office in Moscow and featured prominent 
international experts from the HELP network.
In the two years since this initiative has commenced, the World Bank team, in cooperation 
with the Institute of the Information Society (IIS), Analytical Center under the Government 
and other Russian organizations has developed a Digital Economy Country Assessment 
(DECA) methodology1 that uses a set of indicators to assess the current level of digital 
economy development, conducted pilot assessments in Russia at the national, as well as 
at the regional level in the Ulyanovsk Oblast. The team established a working group and 
online community on digital economy in Russia2 mostly comprising Russian and Eurasian 
experts and other stakeholders, and organized a series of international and local seminars. 
The main goal of these activities was to catalyze and help design a national digital economy 
program; facilitate joint articulation of key challenges and opportunities, guiding principles, 
and policy recommendations to help Russia unlock the socioeconomic benefits of digital 
economy development, including inclusive economic growth, job creation, and better ser -
vices; and help position Russia among the global leaders in digital transformation.xx COMPETING IN THE DIGITAL AGE: RUSSIA DIGITAL ECONOMY REPORT
In parallel, in 2017, under an agreement with the Ministry of Telecom and Mass 
Communications, the World Bank team provided advisory support in the design of the 
Russia Digital Economy Program. With a demanding time frame of only six months from 
inception to the adoption of the program, the Russian government set up a number of 
multi-stakeholder working groups tasked with designing key components of the Digital 
Economy Program. The World Bank team engaged leading international experts from the 
HELP network and experts within the World Bank, who provided global perspectives on 
best practices and innovations for digital economy strategy and program design. The team 
also produced analytical briefs on various aspects of digital economy and provided recom -
mendations on improving the draft of the program.
In July 2017, the program was formally adopted by the government to provide the digital 
foundations for the accelerated social and economic development through 2024. In 2018, 
the government approved roadmaps in all five priority areas outlined in the program and 
allocated RUB 3,040.4 million for their implementation. Implementation of the EAEU Digital 
Agenda that was adopted in 2017 will also be a priority under the Russian chairmanship in 
2018.
The Russia Digital Economy Report synthesizes the main findings and recommendations 
that emerged from this co-creation process. It also builds on the findings of the study con -
ducted in 2016–2017, in partnership with the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC). Based 
on the analysis of international experience and best practice, the study offered recommen-
dations to help maximize the economic impact of the development of the common digital 
space in the EAEU. The present report was also informed by the findings of the World 
Bank’s “Reaping Digital Dividends in Europe and Central Asia” report and the special focus 
on Russia’s digital economy in the Russia Economic Report May 2018 issue.
The Russia Digital Economy Report Structure
This report provides an overview of the role of emerging technologies in digital transforma -
tion and the global best practices in policy responses to the disruptions they cause across 
a broad spectrum of economic activity. It analyzes the successes and challenges of digital 
transformation in Russia and attempts to develop key recommendations to help policy 
makers accelerate the pace of digital transformation across the main sectors of the Russian 
economy.
In its current version, the report starts with discussing the results of the Russia DECA and 
offers an analysis of international best practice in formulating policy approaches to stimu -
late digital adoption while easing the disruption caused by the rapid emergence of new 
technologies. The objective is to help policy makers think through ways to harness the 
opportunities created by emerging technologies to enable Russia to accelerate the pace of 
digital transformation.
The report then discusses the emergence of digital platforms as key enablers of digital 
transformation and proceeds to explore sectoral dynamics in the key digital transformation 
areas outlined in the Russia Digital Economy Program, including digital government, digital 
business, as well as digital innovation and skills building.
Sector-oriented chapters follow a similar structure by analyzing international best practice 
in the transformation of a particular sector, offering an assessment of the current state of 
transformation of that sector in Russia and concluding with proposing a set of recommenda-
tions that may help accelerate the digital transformation of the sector in light of international 
best practice and the local experience (Figure I.1).
Due to the rapid pace of technological change and space limitations, this report does not 
pretend to offer in-depth analysis of Russian digital transformation at the sectoral level, but INTRODUCTION  xxi
is rather an attempt to analyze global best practice to inform Russian policy making and 
an invitation to the policy-maker and expert community to continue the digital co-creation 
experience started two years ago in the hope that it is an effective way to share the just-in-
time global expertise of the World Bank whenever and wherever it is needed most in order 
to help accelerate Russia’s digital transformation process.FIGURE I.1  Report Structure

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  xxiii
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The pace of technological change is accelerating. The rapid emergence of new 
disruptive technologies creates new challenges for global digital leaders, followers, 
and late adopters alike. The risks of disruption inherent in new technologies add many 
layers of complexity to government policy making. The role of government becomes an 
increasingly difficult balancing act between protecting the fundamental interests of the 
country and its constituents, on the one hand, and harnessing emerging technologies to 
ensure national competitiveness and accelerate economic growth, on the other hand.
These challenges are evident in Russia, where digital transformation has been a top 
priority for the Russian government, and the country has achieved some impressive 
successes in this sphere. As Russia prepares for a technological breakthrough—a key 
strategic objective formulated by its leadership in the May 2018 Presidential Decree (The 
Decree on the National Goals and Strategic National Development Tasks of the Russian 
Federation until 2024)—policy makers need to build upon the country’s traditional 
strengths, create mechanisms for the rapid adoption of new technologies across all key 
areas of competitive strength, and proactively address the existing challenges that may 
create barriers to breakthrough success.
An assessment of Russia’s current state of digital economy development (DECA) 
recently performed by the World Bank in cooperation with the IIS and other partners 
concludes that the country’s ambitious vision for growth through breakthrough 
innovation, its investments into national broadband infrastructure, relative strengths 
in science and technology, a developed legislative and policy framework, and the 
global competitiveness of its cybersecurity industry position Russia to become a global 
digital leader. Yet, it also warns that structural weaknesses in the digital transformation 
ecosystem, inadequate digital skills, restricted access to capital markets, and a lack of an 
open innovation culture constrain Russia’s ability to achieve fundamental technological 
breakthroughs in the near term. Critical to Russia’s midterm success are improvements 
in the transparency of its business environment, investment into digital skills, adoption of 
new technologies in key areas of competitive strength, and enhanced links among all the 
key stakeholders in the digital ecosystem, including the public sector, the private sector, 
civil society, and the scientific community.
Global experience indicates that disruptive technologies such as the Internet of 
Things (IoT), data analytics, quantum computing, artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, 
blockchain, and so on transform business models and challenge policy makers to find 
ways to maximize social and economic gains at the regional, national, and global levels. 
Policies should focus on creating an enabling environment for innovation and devising 
mechanisms for effective governance, strategic future planning, and institutional agility 
supported by a flexible legal and regulatory framework. Global best practice emphasizes 
the need to catalyze digital innovation across the economy by strengthening the 
innovation ecosystem, balancing stimulation and competition policies, ensuring the 
availability of funding, and building new skills for the digital age while providing for 
adequate protection of national security, personal privacy, consumer interests, and 
intellectual property rights.xxiv COMPETING IN THE DIGITAL AGE: RUSSIA DIGITAL ECONOMY REPORT
In an increasingly digital world, digital platforms are the enablers of cross-sectoral 
transformation as they empower the performance of ecosystems by facilitating rapid and 
continuous communication, cooperation, and co-creation across organizations, borders, 
and time zones. Government as a platform (GaaP) enables the co-creation of a wide 
range of services by all economic actors. Platform-based digital factories revolutionize 
industrial production. Platform-based marketplaces transform services and agriculture. 
Educational platforms empower learners of all ages, social groups, and so on. In a 
number of areas, Russian digital platforms today dominate the Russian market, in spite 
of competition from global giants. Some Russian companies have emerged as global 
leaders. Thus, Russian policy makers need to pay special attention to encouraging this 
model for digital transformation across economic sectors. It is important to strike the 
right balance between the protection of national interests and consumer interests and 
the support of the growth of digital platforms to gain digital dividends in all the areas of 
economic activity these platforms transform.
In terms of public sector transformation, Russia has adopted global best practices and 
achieved a degree of success in developing a robust national broadband infrastructure, 
extensive mobile penetration, and e-government service delivery, as well as in launching 
digital adoption in education, health care, culture, and social services. Barriers remain 
at the cross-agency level and in back-end government transformation, as well as in 
data management. There are also significant disparities at the level of regions and 
municipalities. Strong leadership is required to ensure enhanced cooperation between 
federal, regional, and municipal governments, as well as for the implementation of a 
data-driven GaaP approach for offering user-centric services. The transition to data-
driven administration and the innovative use of emerging digital technologies such as 
data analytics, blockchain, IoT, and AI will accelerate the transformation to the next 
level of digital government in Russia and create the foundation for future technological 
breakthroughs.
Conversely, Russian business, with the exception of a few leading enterprises, is 
generally lagging in digital adoption, especially in the traditional sectors. Russia needs 
to adopt digital tools to strengthen the competitiveness of its key industry sectors 
while exercising a top-down approach to accelerate the transformation of the dominant 
state-owned enterprises (SoEs). Leveraging existing initiatives such as TechNet NTI 
and 4.0 RU for the development of a single digital industry strategy would help achieve 
industrial development objectives. Engaging the private sector in digital transformation 
partnerships, fostering connections with the scientific and research and development 
(R&D) community, ensuring cooperation among the key stakeholders in the digital 
industry ecosystem, prioritizing resources, and creating favorable taxation regulation to 
incentivize investments into digital technologies and R&D are all mechanisms that need 
to be used to maximize breakthrough opportunities.
Boosting R&D into new digital technologies and understanding their potential to 
transform traditional industries and create new ones should be high on the government 
and private sector agendas. Understanding the impact of emerging technologies on 
existing business models is key to gaining competitive advantage. The digital industry 
strategy should ensure a high level of coordination between industrial development 
objectives and digital transformation goals to accelerate the creation of clusters of 
innovative companies and new drivers of economic growth.
Digital innovation has also started a revolution in agriculture. In recent years, Russian 
agriculture has experienced significant growth and became a leader of Russian exports, 
as some large Russian agribusinesses started to drive the adoption of cutting-edge 
digital technologies in farming practices. In developing the Digital Agriculture Project 
to be included into the Russia Digital Economy Program, Russian policy makers should 
focus on encouraging broader adoption of digital technologies by large agribusiness 
farms as well as empowering small and medium farms to take advantage of digital 
tools to transform their business and service models. It is critical to focus on the digital EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  xxv
transformation of the entire agribusiness cluster that includes not only production but 
also storage, transportation, and logistics companies, financing and telecom service 
providers, the scientific community, venture capital (VC), machinery, biotechnology and 
chemical industry players, and others and use digital platforms and other tools to enable 
collaboration, gain access, and provide products and services to new customers and 
market segments regionally, nationally, and globally.
The services sector in Russia was generally faster to react to the opportunities inherent 
in digital adoption. E-commerce, digital marketplaces, and digital platforms have been 
growing rapidly, while some service sectors, notably Russian digital finance, have 
become global leaders.
Digital finance solutions underpin digital platforms and drive the transformation across 
the services sector. The Russian market for financial technologies has been experiencing 
rapid growth driven by the adoption of online payments and remittances characteristic of 
emerging economies, on the one hand, and the adoption of FinTech solutions for more 
mature markets such as insurance, lending, and investment management, on the other 
hand. The sector has also been an early adopter of cutting-edge technologies such as 
biometrics and blockchain and has been driving the adoption of a national digital ID 
system. Policy makers should further encourage innovation in this sector by adopting 
appropriate regulation and fostering partnerships in the digital finance ecosystem, 
including the public sector, regulatory agencies, FinTech companies, banks, and other 
financial organizations.
For more Russian companies to emerge as digital leaders on the global stage, support 
of innovation and digital entrepreneurship is key. Today it is supported by a number 
of government initiatives, yet weaknesses in the innovation ecosystem as well as a 
historical lack of an open innovation culture that respects entrepreneurs and encourages 
risk taking have led to stagnation in this space. VC investments have plateaued and 
the number of successful exits has declined in recent years. Improving the coordination 
between different policy instruments, incentivizing SoEs to drive demand for innovation, 
ensuring the predictability of the business environment, and internationalizing the 
Russian start-up ecosystem are necessary.
Specific policies should be implemented to encourage innovation and entrepreneurship  
in the digital transformation context. Sustainable innovation requires close coordination 
between the government, the private sector, and the academic community. The public 
sector should not only support fundamental research and drive the development 
of world-class R&D units in Russia but also implement policies to encourage the 
commercialization of R&D outputs, while the private sector should focus on go-to-
market strategies and new business model development. An efficient regulatory system 
encouraging innovation should be further developed, with a special focus on intellectual 
property rights protection and patent regulation.
To accelerate the digital transformation of Russian business, policies should be aimed 
at the development of a receptive domestic market that values the processes and 
outputs of digital transformation. These include specific steps aimed at improving the 
local business climate and focused market development initiatives to boost local demand, 
especially through driving digital transformation of the large dominant state-owned 
enterprises (SoEs). Initiatives aimed at building the public’s trust in the digital economy 
are also important.
Policy makers should also focus on ways to leverage digital technologies to alleviate 
disparities in the development of Russia’s regions and municipalities and to enable the 
less-advanced regions to take advantage of and effectively localize the implementation 
of the national digital economy programs. Policies should focus on local digital skills 
development, management training, local public-private sector partnerships and 
innovation cluster building, local market development, and funding mechanisms. Special xxvi COMPETING IN THE DIGITAL AGE: RUSSIA DIGITAL ECONOMY REPORT
attention should be given to the development of digital infrastructure in remote and rural 
areas and to educating rural populations about the benefits of digital services. There are 
several overarching takeaways from this study.
First of all, to prepare for digital disruption and to uncover opportunities for digital 
creation, policy makers around the world and in Russia need to strengthen the non-
digital foundations of their economies by maintaining leadership focus on the role of 
digital transformation in achieving national performance objectives; ensure agility in 
revising regulation to address the rapidly changing needs of the new digital economy; 
and empower an ecosystem of decision makers, institutions, and organizations 
responsible for stimulating digital transformation and managing digital disruption.
Effective project management is also of the essence. Detailed road maps need to be 
developed and implemented in line with key strategy objectives and project portfolios 
prioritized to identify quick wins, as well as longer-term strategic initiatives. New 
governance mechanisms that engage all the key stakeholders in the decision-making and 
governance process should be introduced to accelerate the pace of transformation in line 
with stated goals. Budgets and financing mechanisms need to be firmly in place.
The dividends of building a competitive digital economy are high, and a high-level 
leadership focus on tightly targeted policies and flawless execution is required to 
accelerate the pace of this transformation.
Second, the government needs to continue to strengthen the digital foundations  
by preemptively investing into a scalable intelligent secure infrastructure capable of 
anticipating the exploding demand for the digital economy.
Third, it is about strengthening the digital transformation ecosystem both horizontally, 
across all sectors of the economy at the national, regional, and municipal levels, and 
vertically, throughout the sectors and subsectors of government, industry, and services.
Weak links between the government, private sector, research organizations, and 
academic institutions negatively affect the pace of digital transformation, the 
implementation of key government programs, the adoption of new technologies and 
business models, proactive responses to technological and economic disruptions and 
crises, and the speed of innovation. A strong and effective operational ecosystem is the 
foundation of the technological breakthrough envisioned by the Russian leadership.
Fourth, it is about boosting digital skills, as any technological breakthrough requires a 
highly-trained workforce. In spite of its traditional strength in theoretical science, the 
Russian education system is not sufficiently agile to respond to the digital transformation 
requirements in all economic spheres. Strengthening the training and education 
ecosystem, starting at the level of kindergarten and all the way up to higher education, 
including coordination between enterprises and educational institutions in higher 
education and R&D, is a must. So are investments into educational platforms for the rapid 
development of digital economy skills across the country and training and upskilling the 
existing workforce with a focus on learner-centric life-long educational models. Policy 
makers should also focus on reversing brain drain and attracting and retaining talent, as 
well as attracting the best and brightest back into the country.
And finally, it is about cultural transformation. As digital transformation breaks down 
barriers between sectors, regions, organizations, and individuals, it challenges traditional 
centralized hierarchical governance structures and requires a new culture of ongoing 
innovation. Key elements of this culture include open communication and knowledge 
sharing, horizontal cross-team collaboration and co-creation, proactive experimentation 
and problem-solving, risk taking, and the ability to translate failure into opportunity. 
Specific initiatives aimed at promoting a culture of open innovation should become a 
priority for Russian policy makers.EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  xxvii
In summary, the ongoing Russian government commitment to digital transformation as 
a national priority, if complemented by effective policies across key economic sectors 
and a results-oriented focus on implementation, will enable the country to join the 
world’s digital transformation leaders and position it for a technological breakthrough 
and the achievement of the economic and social benefits it implies.1 COMPETING IN THE DIGITAL AGE: RUSSIA DIGITAL ECONOMY REPORT

in national broadband infrastructure, relative strengths in science and technology, a 
developed legislative and policy framework, and a competitive cybersecurity industry 
position it to become a global digital leader. Yet, structural weaknesses in the digital 
transformation ecosystem, inadequate digital skills, restricted access to capital markets, 
and a lack of an open innovation culture constrain Russia’s ability to achieve fundamental 
technological breakthroughs in the near term. Critical to Russia’s midterm success are 
improvements in the transparency of its business environment, investment into digital 
skills, adoption of new technologies in key areas of competitive strength, and enhanced 
links among all the key stakeholders in the digital ecosystem, including the public sector, 
the private sector, and the scientific community.
In July 2017, Russia adopted the Russia Digital Economy Program with an expected annual 
budget of US$1.8 billion until 20253 to address the current weaknesses preventing the 
country from joining global digital economy leaders.
The program is quite comprehensive, focusing on both analogue and digital foundations  
of digital transformation and addressing the legal, technical, organizational, and financial 
aspects of this process. In preparing this program, its authors were able to draw upon 
international best practice in digital transformation.
They prioritized changes in the legal and regulatory framework; addressed key aspects 
of building digital skills, education, and research and development (R&D); proposed 
investments in digital infrastructure and cybersecurity; emphasized strict program 
management requirements; and proposed specific initiatives in e-government, smart cities, 
and e-health. Given the high priority assigned to this program at the most senior levels 
of government, along with the funding allocated through the federal budget, there are 
reasons to believe that if properly implemented, this program will allow Russia to make 
significant progress in its digital transformation process.
To gain a better understanding of the challenges that are likely to face the Russian 
government in implementing the Russia Digital Economy Program, in 2017, the World Bank 
in cooperation with the Institute of the Information Society (IIS) and other local partners 
in Russia conducted a Digital Economy Country Assessment (DECA) for Russia by doing 
the first global pilot of this holistic benchmarking tool being developed under the Digital 
Development Partnership initiative.4
CHAPTER 1
3 COMPETING IN THE DIGITAL AGE: RUSSIA DIGITAL ECONOMY REPORT
The approach to the DECA was based on the digital development vision initially presented 
in the World Bank’s World Development Report 2016: Digital Dividends (WDR 2016).5 
The report examined the socioeconomic effects of digital transformation—the digital 
dividends—and the conditions for achieving them.
The assessment focused on evaluating the key conditions for the development of a digital 
economy: its non-digital foundations; the use of digital technologies to transform key 
sectors of the economy and the society at large; and the impact of digital technologies on 
socioeconomic development in terms of economic growth, jobs, and quality of services. 
The assessment yielded several important findings (Figure 1.2).

BOX 1.1
DIGITAL ECONOMY COUNTRY ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY
The DECA methodology is focused on assessing the 
existing level of digital economy development to deter-
mine the current maturity level of the digital economy 
in a country. The assessment helps identify key gaps, 
challenges, and opportunities for future growth as well 
as areas that require more careful analysis. The digital 
economy—the economy based on the development 
and use of digital technologies—is built on foundations 
that enable economic and social transformation (see 
Figure 1.1). It consists of:
 ●Non-digital foundations, including policy and stra-
tegic planning, leadership and institutions, regula-
tory framework, human capital, innovation, business 
environment, trust, and security, which provide the 
enabling environment within which digital transforma-
tion can occur;
 ●Digital foundations, including digital infrastructure, 
shared digital platforms, and emerging digital tech-
nologies; and
 ●The digital sector of the economy, comprising the 
ICT-sector and the content and media sector.
Digital transformation affects the public and private sec-
tors of the economy, as well as society at large. Thus, the 
methodology includes the assessment of the:
 ●Digital transformation of the public sector, which 
includes digital and non-digital foundations, as well as 
the use of traditional and emerging digital technolo-
gies in the public sector; ●Digital transformation of the private sector, consist-
ing of digital and non-digital foundations, as well as 
the use of traditional and emerging digital technolo-
gies in the private sector; and
 ●Digital citizens and consumers addressing citizen 
access to and use of digital technologies for social 
and economic activities, including work, the purchase 
of goods and services, education, social networking, 
political participation, and so on.
Digital transformation has a significant impact on eco-
nomic and social processes, primarily on economic 
growth, the labor market, and the quality of services.
Each subject area of the assessment is characterized 
by a set of indicators of two types—quantitative indica-
tors (including those used by international organizations) 
and qualitative indicators that characterize important 
aspects of development, which do not have metrics. To 
determine the relative strengths and weaknesses and 
the focus areas for the digital economy development in 
a country, all the indicators are assessed on a five-point 
scale based on benchmarking of global international 
experience and best practices.
The DECA framework is designed following the “matry-
oshka doll” principle: a common set of indicators can be 
applied to an entire country, a region, or to a particular 
sector of the economy (for example, education or health 
care).DIGITAL ECONOMY IN RUSSIA: KEY RESULTS OF THE DIGITAL ECONOMY COUNTRY ASSESSMENT  4

PUBLIC POLICY AND STRATEGIC PLANNING
While Russia has developed a clear vision and strategy for its digital transformation and 
has set ambitious goals, more work needs to be done in devising detailed action plans and 
creating road maps for the implementation of this strategy.
More effort needs to be invested into optimizing the governance of this process (for example, 
creating strategic foresight units to improve agility) and into the development of monitoring 
and evaluation tools to access the effectiveness of the implementation of the strategy.
It is also critical to develop a mechanism for ongoing engagement of all the key stakeholders 
in the transition to a digital economy and for ongoing coordination at the federal, regional, 
and municipal levels.
LEADERSHIP AND INSTITUTIONS
There is a very high level of leadership commitment to and responsibility for the acceleration 
of digital transformation in Russia, which was once again emphasized as a top strategic 
priority in the May 2018 Presidential Decree. The decree targets a threefold investment in the 
digital economy relative to 2017 levels. However, the commitment of the traditional enterprise 
and commercial sectors in digital transformation is not as strong. Incentives may be required 
to stimulate a more active adoption of digital tools and strategies by the business sector and 
the public at large.
LEGISLATION AND REGULATION
Hard work on Russia’s legal framework in the last decade has led to the development of 
updated regulations on digital payment systems, digital infrastructure, and cybersecurity 
policy. Moreover, according to the 2016 World Bank Global Indicator of Regulatory 
Governance, Russia was ranked 4 out of 6 in transparency and general public inclusion in the 
legislative process.6 In 2018, Russia’s top standard-setting agency, Rosstandart, ordered the 
expansion of responsibilities of the technical committee for standardization in “cyber-physical 
systems” to cover the Internet of Things (IoT), smart cities, big data, smart manufacturing, 
and artificial intelligence (AI).7 The May 2018 Presidential Decree emphasizes the need for a 
flexible approach in regulating digital adoption in different sectors of the economy. More work 
needs to be done in the area of protecting the rights of online users and in terms of regulation 
of digital transactions.
Another area for development is creating the mechanisms to stimulate the use of digital 
goods and services. Existing gaps in the regulations create barriers for the implementation of 
digital technologies in the private sector, which in turn slows down its digital transformation.
HUMAN CAPITAL
In terms of human capital, in 2016 Russia scored a fairly high 28th place out of 130 countries 
on the World Economic Forum (WEF) Index of Human Capital 2016.8 High international rank -
ings in human capital development have been a reflection of Russia’s strength in this area

Capital 2016DIGITAL ECONOMY IN RUSSIA: KEY RESULTS OF THE DIGITAL ECONOMY COUNTRY ASSESSMENT  6
since Soviet times. Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) rankings in reading, 
science, and math skills remain high to this day. However, most current educational programs 
have not been updated in line with digital economy requirements, and training in digital com-
petencies remains insufficient, so there is a lack of skilled digital economy graduates. Most 
educational programs have not been updated and do not provide for the development of 
core competencies in digital transformation.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Boosting innovation and R&D is a key objective that requires focused efforts to enable 
digital economy growth. While Russia has a reasonably well-developed innovation 
infrastructure, the innovation mentality and the institutional commitment to innovation are 
lacking. This is evident from a low overall share of R&D spending, low levels of enterprise 
R&D spending, low share of R&D in ICT spending, weak links between businesses and 
universities, insufficient research in the digital economy field, and low availability of 
venture capital (VC) resulting in few start-ups. A joint effort by the government, business 
leaders, and the scientific community is required to overcome the barriers to effective R&D, 
entrepreneurship, and innovation.
This situation is exacerbated by the continuing challenges in Russia’s overall business 
environment. While the country was ranked 35 in the World Bank’s 2018 Doing Business 
index,9 up from 53 in 2016 and 112 in 2013, some key challenges need to be addressed. 
For example, a relatively high total taxation rate impedes business innovation. In the WEF 
Global Competitiveness Report 2017–2018, Russia ranked 101, at 47.4 percent taxation10 
(compared to 44 percent in the United States, 30.9 percent in the United Kingdom, and 
21 percent in Canada). Access to new technologies remains limited, the protection of 
intellectual property rights is insufficient, the perception of corruption remains high, and 
judiciary independence is seen as low.
1.2 Digital Foundations
In the past years, Russia has focused on developing broadband access and has built a fairly 
strong and advanced digital infrastructure marked by a competitive telecommunications 
market, high rates of mobile penetration, affordable broadband, and a high level of 
cybersecurity (Figure 1.3). This infrastructure has enabled the growth of strong domestic 
and localized digital platforms and should now be used to launch 4.5 and 5G mobile 
networks to create a more efficiently distributed network of data centers, to develop local 
companies in the data analytics space, and to introduce new/emerging technologies 
such as the IoT, AI, robotics, and blockchain. The interest in the new/emerging digital 
technologies in Russia is very high, with Russian products starting to appear in the AI, 
blockchain, and robotics space.
More broadly, however, this interest has yet to translate into specific strategies, new 
products and services, commercialization models, and national projects that could bring 
Russia into a leadership positions in this field.
Investment into a globally competitive secure infrastructure to support the growth of a data-
driven economy remains a top priority, as emphasized in the May 2018 Presidential Decree.

1.3 Digital Transformation of the 
Different Sectors of the Economy
DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION
In the development of digital government, Russia has achieved some successes in recent 
years, most notably an increase in the number of digital state and municipal services using 
the e-government infrastructure and an increase in the number of registered users (70 
million as of March 201811) of the Unified Public Services Portal (Figure 1.4).
The impact of digital government implementation has been felt by citizens and corporate 
users alike and the former have reported particularly high levels of user satisfaction. Russia 
has also done well in setting the stage for open government. Disparities still exist in the 
use of digital technologies at the federal, regional, and municipal levels of government, 
with only 10 percent of local self-government organizations in line with national digitization 
requirements. To move to the next stage of maturity of digital development, a significant 
transformation of the current e-government architecture will be required, including the 
reengineering of administrative processes and the emphasis on the use of national 
databases, the sharing of digital services by local governments, and the provision 
of proactive digital government platform services for direct citizens and businesses 
interaction.
In cybersecurity, Russia is among the global leaders, ranking 10 in the 2017 International 
Telecommunication Union (ITU) Global Cybersecurity Index.12 Still, two-thirds of Russian 
companies believe that in the last three years, the number of cybercrimes has risen by 75

percent,13 which suggests that cybersecurity should become a focus for the private sector 
as well. Also, further work is required to educate the public about cybersecurity threats as 
more Russians become active online.
DIGITIZATION OF SOCIAL SERVICES SHOULD BE HIGH  
ON THE GOVERNMENT AGENDA
E-health implementation is still in its early stages. While the digital infrastructure required for 
e-health transformation is largely in place, and legislation has been adopted to enable the 
use of electronic medical records nationally as well as for providing telemedicine services, 
the use of digital and innovative technologies in health care remains low and requires 
further effort. There are also significant regional disparities in e-health adoption. While large 
cities are making progress, most of the country is still far behind.
In e-education, the digital infrastructure is also in place, available to educational institutions 
of all levels. There is a strong focus on training teachers and administrative staff in digital 
education skills and on creating new education materials and curricula. Digital education 
platforms are emerging, with more opportunities for course selection and personalization. 
Distance learning and digital exams and certifications are gaining popularity. The private 
sector is an active provider of a variety of digital education services, though the budget 
allocated to digital services in public educational institutions is low. Still more needs to 
be done in increasing the quantity, quality, and variety of online education content in line 
with the growing demands of the digital economy. The continuing lack of highly qualified 
teachers and trainers is yet to be addressed (Figure 1.5).
A lot has been done to develop a digital culture in terms of the use of digital technologies 
to transform arts and culture-related organizations such as libraries, museums, archives, 
and theaters. Here again, the digital infrastructure is in place, complete with the necessary

regulations and program documents. The digital transformation is taking place in a number 
of cultural institutions, with new databases and formats of interaction defined. Still, digital 
platforms in this field are underdeveloped, partly due to unresolved conflicts between 
copyright owners and ICT firms.
DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS PROGRESSING SLOWLY
Apart from some automation initiatives, including the implementation of enterprise resource 
planning (ERP) systems in some large enterprises, there are few examples of digital 
transformation successes in the private sector. The government-led digital transformation 
has focused on top-down public sector digitization, while the private sector, for the most 
part, has suffered from a lack of relevant knowledge and management experience among 
enterprise managers and employees, as well as a lack of competitive pressures caused 
by a high degree of market consolidation in key sectors and high barriers to entry for new 
players. Private sector innovation is stagnating due to limited corporate R&D budgets and 
taxation regulations that do not provide incentives to invest in R&D. Links with the academic

DIGITAL EDUCATION PLATFORMS IN RUSSIA
In 2015, the “National Platform for Open Education” association, with the support of the Ministry of Education and 
Science of Russia, created the online “Open Education” platform linking the top 9 out of 814 Russian universities. 
Today there are more than 120,000 students attending 140 courses on this national platform for online training. In 
addition, there are several popular nongovernment digital educational platforms: the Lectorium (www.lektorium.tv), 
the Universarium (www.universarium.org), Uniweb (www.uniweb.ru), and so on. Leading Russian universities are also 
represented on global educational platforms like Coursera and EdX. Data analysis is widely used to monitor student 
progress.FIGURE 1.5  Russia’s Digital Economy Assessment: Digital Education

community locally and internationally are weak, and little has been done to set industry 
standards for data analysis and integration (Figure 1.6).
These trends are observed across large emerging economies, notably the so-called BRICS. 
According to the World Bank’s Digital Adoption Index,14 public sector transformation in 
Brazil, China, India, and South Africa (BRICS) is significantly ahead of digital technologies 
adoption by the private sector.
Despite the challenges the private sector is facing, there are enterprise leaders pioneering 
digital technologies in a number of sectors and competing with foreign players in their 
fields. Overall, according to the McKinsey, digitization-level assessment,15 ICT, education, 
and finance are ahead. But in key industrial sectors such as mining, manufacturing, 
transport, and agriculture, Russia is behind global leaders.
The e-commerce market is growing, despite the relatively underdeveloped logistics 
channels throughout the country and competition from cross-border players.
The national focus on digital transformation in Russia and the rollout of digital services has 
caused a rapid rise in the numbers of online users and the participation of the population 
in the digital economy. This is particularly visible in large cities, less so in rural areas. It is 
worth noting that there are no gender disparities relating to the utilization of digital ser -
vices, and in the rural areas, women outnumber men in most areas of Internet use.16 More 
and more households enjoy broadband connectivity, including on mobile devices. Expert 
assessments point to a growing confidence of the Russian population in digital government, 
digital participation, the sharing economy, and the use of payment cards.

1.4 The Social and Economic Impact 
of Digital Transformation
In terms of the social and economic impacts of the transformation to the digital economy, 
Russia is beginning to experience certain benefits and gains (Figure 1.7). According to a 
composite subindex for impact assessment created from the WEF Network Readiness Index 
2016,17 Russia ranks 41 on reaping social and economic benefits from digital transformation. 
The lowest rankings for Russia are on the impact of ICT on new business models, goods, and 
services (97th place), on accessibility of basic services (88th), on new forms of organization 
(75th), and on government effectiveness (61st).18 It rates higher on the impact of new forms of 
financial services related to digital technology (FinTech) developed in Russia, mainly due to 
two widely used products in the country: online payments and transfers of funds.19
In 2011–2012, both McKinsey and the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) estimated the 
contribution of the Internet to Russia’s economic growth to be between 1 percent and 2 
percent.20 The Economist proposed the existence of a “threshold effect,” whereby the use of 
ICT starts to positively influence economic growth after reaching a certain level of penetration 
of technologies into the economy and/or after a certain period.21
Given the ongoing discussion and lack of consensus to date among digital development 
academics and practitioners on ways and methodologies to measure the size of the digital 
economy and the impact of digital transformation, these rankings and calculations should be 
taken with a grain of salt.22

In 2015, McKinsey estimated that the share of the digital economy in Russia’s gross 
domestic product (GDP) rose to 3.9 percent (compared to 8.2 percent in the European 
Union (EU), 10 percent in China, and 10.9 percent in the United States),23 whereas BCG 
suggested 2.1 percent24 — a significant increase over five years, yet still not on par with 
global leaders. Russia’s business climate shortcomings continue to negatively affect 
potential digital dividend gains. Moreover, given the reliance of the Russian economy on oil 
and gas, economic growth is strongly affected by fluctuations in global oil prices that may 
overshadow the measurement of a smaller digital economy. Yet, that share is growing, and 
BCG predicts that by 2021 the share of the digital economy in Russian GDP will reach 5.6 
percent.25
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
In summary, the DECA analysis results (Figure 1.2) confirmed 
the World Bank’s earlier assessment of Russia as a country 
that is transitioning to a digital economy, having created a 
solid platform for the digital leap in terms of both non-digital 
and digital factors. It has built on its traditional strengths such 
as human capital, scientific excellence, strong leadership, 
and security, while its recent focus on digital infrastructure, 
strategic planning, and regulation has started to pay off. 
However, the digital transformation of the public sector 
(government, education, health, and culture), especially the 
transformation of business through the application of digital 
technologies, needs to be accelerated. R&D, innovation, and 
entrepreneurship are underdeveloped by global standards. Adoption of digital technologies 
by the general public outside the large cities is quite low. All of these may explain the lack 
of significant quantifiable social and economic effects—the digital dividends—from the 
digitization process.
The work ahead requires specific policies and steady dedication to accelerate the pace 
of private and public sector transformation; raise public awareness of the use of digital 
technologies, to foster links between the scientific community and private and public 
sectors; and focus on developing a business climate conducive to innovation, R&D, and 
entrepreneurship—all of which are key elements of a digital economy culture now in short 
supply in Russia. Improving the regulatory and taxation environment, boosting investment 
in innovation, and fostering entrepreneurship should become top policy priorities.
ASSESSING DIGITAL ADOPTION AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL
To join global digital leaders, it is critical for Russia to address the disparities in digital 
adoption at the regional level, which could slow the progress of its digital transformation. 
Differences in the economic development of the different parts of the Federation are likely 
to be reflected at the digital level too.
To better understand the challenges Russian regions are facing in implementing digital 
transformation, the World Bank has conducted a Digital Economy Assessment (DECA) of 
the Ulyanovsk Oblast of Russia by applying the same methodology principles used in the 
assessment of Russia at the national level. This was the first global pilot of the DECA at the 
subnational level.

The regional government’s commitment to driving digital transformation and attracting 
investment has translated into a relatively well-developed digital infrastructure, a competitive 
telecommunications market, high mobile penetration rates, affordable broadband access, and 
high user awareness of cybersecurity issues. Municipal services are provided electronically, 
and 98.9 percent of users are completely or partially satisfied with online government 
services.26 The region also has a reasonably well-developed infrastructure for innovation: it 
ranks 16 out of all Russian regions and is among the most innovative regions in Russia and 
the share of R&D expenditure in the gross regional product (GRP) is quite high.27 The region’s 
government lends strong support to the development of the digital sector of the economy, 
specifically encouraging small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and offering taxation and 
other preferences to the ICT sector. The region was among the first in Russia to do this. 
As a result, 3.3 percent of the local workforce is employed by the region’s almost 200 ICT 
companies (compared to 2 percent in the ICT sector in Russia overall).28
Nevertheless, despite the relatively well-developed infrastructure, there is a lack of innovation 
in traditional industry and few start-up successes. Persistently weak links within the innovation 
cluster may be a cause, with insufficient communication and few partnerships between 
businesses, the R&D scientific community, the public sector, and other players. The business 
environment, which is reflective of Russia’s general business climate challenges such as 
corruption, limited access to new technologies, and insufficient protection of intellectual 
property rights, is also a constraint. In line with the general trend in Russia, emerging 
technology services such as cloud computing and data analytics are underdeveloped.
In terms of private sector transformation, the situation is also reflective of that in Russia, 
as examples of digital transformation leadership in the private sector and of resulting 
changes in business models are limited to a few individual enterprises. Moreover, the share 
of enterprises engaged in innovations related to digital transformation is half the Russian 
average, although the share of business expenditure on R&D is more than double the 
Russian and even global average. This should be cause for concern and a call to action for 
26 Estimates provided by the government of the Ulyanovsk Oblast.

THE ULYANOVSK OBLAST OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION
The Ulyanovsk Oblast is located in the heart of the Volga region, in the southeast of European Russia. It has a popula -
tion of 1.3 million and an area of 37.2 km2—0.22 percent of the Russian territory. Its location at the heart of the Volga 
federal region puts it advantageously at the crossroads of transport and logistics links between the Volga region and 
Europe, Central Asia, China, and the Middle East. Industrial development historically focused on mechanical engineer -
ing, hosting Europe’s largest aircraft factory, Aviastar-SP, and the Ulyanovsk car factory, which traces its roots back to 
World War II with the production of the UAZ off-road vehicles. In 2018, Ulyanovsk announced a plan to open а compe -
tence center for unmanned systems set in the “Ulyanovsk-Avia” cluster. The fifth International Air Transport Forum will 
be held in Ulyanovsk in August 2018.a
The region is also active in tool making and machine tools, as well as textiles, food processing, construction, woodwork -
ing, and forestry. A nuclear innovation cluster has been created in the city of Dimitrovgrad. Innovation in Dimitrovgrad 
and at Ulyanovsk Avia has led to the formation of the region’s Innovation Cluster that made it to the national list of the 
top 11 advanced development territories of the country. Industrial development zones and special economic zones have 
been established to attract investment by Russian and foreign companies. More recently, the city has adopted a smart 
region development program aimed at transforming the region by using digital technologies.

the region’s leaders, who possess sufficient authority to formulate policy and implement 
meaningful reforms without waiting for solutions from the federal level.
As elsewhere in Russian regions, a shortage of ICT specialists and of ICT training is a key 
factor holding back the digitization of the Ulyanovsk Oblast. This is another issue that can be 
addressed locally, without waiting for a solution at the federal level.
As the case of Ulyanovsk Oblast demonstrates, the impact of digital transformation may be 
more tangible at the regional than at the national level. Today, 100 percent of doctors have 
access to online medical information, 25 percent of students have used distance learning 
courses to improve their qualifications, and the rate of growth of the digital sector of the 
economy is five times higher than that of the real economy of the region. In terms of social 
dividends, Ulyanovsk is already ahead of the national Russian impact, according to statistics 
related to the provision of basic services (medical, educational, financial, and so on).29
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The Ulyanovsk DECA results (Figure 1.8) are broadly in line with the World Bank’s findings in 
the Russia DECA, and the differences, especially with respect to weaknesses, are indicative 
of the situation at the regional level across Russia.
Overall, both the digital and non-digital foundations required to succeed in the digital 
transformation process of the region are in place. In Ulyanovsk, the commitment of the 
region’s leadership to digital transformation is perceived as even higher than at the national 
level, as is the strength of public policy and strategic development plans.
More work needs to be done to overcome the challenges 
posed by the business environment and to address the digital 
literacy and skills gap of the population. It is critical to find 
ways to counteract the brain drain from the region and raise 
and attract qualified personnel, as well as to build trust in the 
digital economy and encourage the public to actively engage 
in economic activity online, through shared digital platforms, 
digital content creation, and other digital mechanisms.
Specific incentives are required to accelerate the back-end digital transformation of public 
and private sector entities and to encourage innovation. The government, business, and 
nonprofit sectors in the region will have to work closely together to overcome these 
challenges and achieve further dividends inherent in digital transformation success.

DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION IN THE KALUGA OBLAST
The Kaluga Oblast has positioned digital transformation at the heart of its economic development strategy whose goal 
is to create an economy driven by digital technologies and digital services in all the key areas of production, as well 
as in education, health care, and urban management. Regional business should also be actively engaged. The region 
intends to focus on developing an appropriate legislative framework, defining its competitive advantages, and selecting 
the priority areas for digital transformation. The northern areas of the region and the city of Obninsk—the first science 
city in Russia—will become the testing ground for rolling out key digital transformation projects.

30 World Bank 2016.The spread of disruptive technologies such as the IoT, data analytics, quantum computing, AI, 
robotics, blockchain, and so on transforms business models and challenges policy makers to 
find ways to maximize social and economic gains at the regional, national, and global levels. 
Policies should focus on creating an enabling environment for innovation and on devising 
mechanisms for effective governance, strategic future planning, and institutional agility 
supported by a flexible legal and regulatory framework. Global best practice emphasizes 
the need to catalyze digital innovation across the economy by strengthening the innovation 
ecosystem, balancing stimulation and competition policies, ensuring the availability of 
funding, and building new skills for the digital age while ensuring adequate protection of 
national security, personal privacy, consumer interests, and intellectual property rights.
2.1 The Rise of the Digital Economy
The digital economy is rapidly transforming countries, regions, and continents. The use of 
digital technologies, tools, and data is dramatically changing traditional business practices 
and service delivery across all sectors. Extending far beyond e-commerce, the digital 
economy now permeates all aspects of society, changing the way people live, work, interact, 
make decisions, learn, and play.
Digitally advanced countries have taken full advantage of the power of the digital economy to 
drive inclusive economic growth, enhance the productivity of traditional sectors, expand and 
diversify trade, and create new services and markets. WDR 2016 identifies three mechanisms 
through which digital technologies affect economic growth: inclusion, efficiency, and 
innovation.30 Digital technologies promote inclusion by enabling companies, including SMEs, 
to expand trade. They increase efficiency by helping companies make better use of capital 
and labor. New technologies enhance innovation and intensify competition by enabling 
companies to exploit scale effects through online platforms and services that compete with 
conventional business models.
Disruptive technologies such as the IoT, additive manufacturing, AI, blockchain, quantum 
computing, robotics, 3-D printing, drones, and cryptocurrencies are used to create innovative 
solutions in transportation, financial services, manufacturing, education, health care, 
agriculture, retail, media, entertainment, and other sectors. Big data analytics is becoming a 
source of competition, productivity growth, innovation, and consumer surplus.
New business models are disrupting traditional industries. Horizontal platforms are eliminating 
insufficiently agile players. Consumer-to-consumer transactions through online platforms, 
websites, or apps have spurred a new “sharing” economy. The so-called “gig” economy is 
transforming the labor market as more individuals break away from traditional lifelong jobs 
CHAPTER 219 COMPETING IN THE DIGITAL AGE: RUSSIA DIGITAL ECONOMY REPORT
to take advantage of remote working, short-term, and temporary positions where they act as 
independent contractors.
As WDR 2016 shows, countries that couple investment in cutting-edge technologies with 
strong leadership, a favorable business environment, a creative workforce, and the ability 
to foster a culture of innovation can reap digital dividends in the form of faster growth, jobs 
creation, and better services. With the appropriate enabling environment, digitally advanced 
organizations are reinventing operational processes, using new business models, and 
delivering innovative and personalized experiences to customers.
Change is often driven by the public sector. For example, the Chinese government plays an 
active role as a supporter, investor, developer, and consumer of digital technologies allowing 
digital players to experiment before enacting official regulation. The result—a rapidly growing 
digital economy in China (Box 2.1). Conversely, weakness in leadership, policy, regulatory 
frameworks, and institutional and human capacity leads to a lack of impact of digital 
innovation, when investments do not result in boosted growth and productivity or in reduced 
inequality in economic and social development.31
New and disruptive technologies will continue to develop, and the challenge for policy 
makers is to continuously address this accelerating pace of change.

BOX 2.1
BOOSTING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY IN CHINA
China’s double-digit GDP growth in the mid-2000s was fueled by even faster growth in the flow of goods out of the 
country. As exports surged from US$257 billion in 2000 to US$2.4 trillion in 2016, China became the world’s top exporter. 
China now has the world’s largest e-commerce market, accounting for more than 40 percent of the value of worldwide 
e-commerce transactions.
In 2016, China had 731 million Internet users, more than the EU and the United States combined. It also became a major 
global force in mobile payments, with 11 times the transaction value of the United States. The share of digital payments in 
China is 68 percent, compared to just 15 percent in the United States. Available, affordable, and easy-to-use digital tools 
facilitate rapid adoption of innovation by Chinese consumers and make Chinese digital players and their business models 
competitive. One in five Internet users in China relies on mobile only, compared to just 5 percent in the United States.
China has one of the most active digital investment and start-up ecosystems in the world. One in three of the world’s 262 
unicorns (start-ups valued at over US$1 billion) is Chinese. The digital ecosystem is now spreading beyond giant compa-
nies such as Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent (BAT), eliminating inefficient and fragmented offline markets. The BAT companies 
have been developing a multifaceted and multi-industry digital ecosystem that touches almost every aspect of consumers’ 
lives. The functionality offered by their “super apps” has increased about seven times since 2011. In 2016, BAT provided 42 
percent of all VC investment in China. Other digital innovators and traditional players are rapidly building their own ecosys-
tems, taking advantage of close links to domestic hardware manufacturers, such as, the producers of connected devices 
in the Pearl River Delta industrial hub.
The Chinese government initially gave digital players space to experiment, before enacting official regulation. Now it 
plays an active role in building world-class infrastructure to support digitization as an investor, developer, and consumer. 
Recognizing the catalyzing power of cutting-edge technologies, China became a leader in public and private VC invest-
ment in virtual reality, autonomous vehicles, 3-D printing, robotics, drones, and AI. As its capacity for innovation deepens, 
China has become one of the leading global hubs for AI development. Recognizing that the nation’s vast population and 
diverse industry mix can generate very large volumes of data and drive demand for innovation, China’s biggest tech com-
panies are making significant R&D investments in AI.

change in the pace of change and our ability to develop the learning systems, training 
systems, management systems, social safety nets, and government regulations that 
would enable citizens to get the most out of these accelerations and cushion their 
worst impacts… if it is true that it now takes us ten to fifteen years to understand a new 
technology and then build out new laws and regulations to safeguard society, how do 
we regulate when the technology has come and gone in five to seven years? This is a 
problem.”32
To realize the full potential and transformative power of disruptive digital technologies, 
governments should identify the trends with the greatest potential for economic impact. 
To leapfrog, the focus should be on creating an enabling environment with an adequate 
legal and regulatory framework and fostering agile institutions. Leadership should be 
strengthened at all levels of government. New partnerships, funding mechanisms, and 
incentives for the business community to innovate should be explored. Building digital 
skills and nurturing and retaining digital talent should be a top government priority.
At the same time, effective policies should be adopted and implemented to guarantee 
data privacy, cybersecurity, consumer protection, and intellectual property rights and to 
address ethical issues arising from digital disruption.
2.2 Disruptive Technologies as 
Drivers of the Digital Economy
Digital technologies are becoming a powerful catalyst of inclusiveness, linking companies, 
customers, communities, professionals, and the general public. Today, people everywhere 
rely on mobile communications, Internet access, and social media to interact, learn, access 
services, and even share assets. Governments and businesses in many countries favor 
online channels for cost-effective delivery of services, marketing, and doing business. 
However, technology trends are changing rapidly.
Some illustrative examples of opportunities as well as risks and challenges for policy 
makers caused by digital disruption are presented in the following paragraphs.
LEVERAGING OPPORTUNITIES OF THE INTERNET OF THINGS
According to a recent World Bank report on IoT,33 governments and businesses around 
the world have already begun to use connected devices to tackle global development 
challenges and solve problems such as pollution, road safety, urban transportation, and 
energy conservation. Innovative IoT solutions include sensors mounted on lampposts that 
measure and share environmental or pollution data, GPS devices that track and provide 
real-time updates on transit, and smart meters that monitor energy consumption.
Moreover, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is giving rise to the next generation of 
industry, as universal wireless connectivity, cloud computing, cheap sensors, and AI are 
combined with data analytics to transform industries such as manufacturing, energy, 
mining, and transportation in digitally advanced countries. IIoT adds a new layer of 
technology that helps optimize operations, track and analyze equipment, implement 
predictive maintenance, interpret massive amounts of data, and make real-time decisions 
that were not possible before.34

DIGITAL TWINS: MERGING THE PHYSICAL AND VIRTUAL WORLDS
By 2020, there will be more than 21 billion connected sensors and endpoints, creating 
digital twins for billions of things.35 Digital twins are a recent phenomenon with important 
applications for business, industry, and government. Digital twins are a complete digital 
representation of individuals, objects, places, or processes and can be used to reconstruct, 
simulate, test, and predict real-world behavior, performance, and products. Created 
through IoT, smartphones with sophisticated cameras, and advances in augmented, virtual, 
and mixed Reality devices and applications, digital twins are increasingly high-fidelity 
digital representations of the real world. They increase agility, reduce time to market and 
production costs, and dramatically improve the efficiencies of supply and production chains.
More and more industries and businesses in digitally advanced countries are taking advan -
tage of the opportunities created by digital twins. For instance, Siemens (Germany) has 
integrated digital twins into manufacturing processes, including simulations of products, 
manufacturing process, and maintenance, enabling virtual verification before manufacturing 
begins.36 General Electric (USA) is also among the earlier adopters, exploiting digital twins 
in production37 to operate on its Internet operating platform, Predix—an open community of 
partners and systems integrators.38
There are also early public sector adopters of digital twin technology. Singapore has 
announced the “Virtual Singapore” program in 2014. With a budget of US$73 million and 
a tentative launch date of July 2018, the program is being implemented collaboratively by 
the National Research Foundation, the Prime Minister’s Office, and the Land Authority.39 A 
3-D digital twin of the city will be used for virtual experimentation, modeling, and simulation 
of crowd dispersion in case of emergency evacuation, as well as for R&D, planning, and 
decision making. The digital twin will be available to government agencies, businesses, the 
research community, and the public.
Like many other disruptive technologies, IoT and digital twins are at the early stages of 
incorporation into government services. To leverage the full potential of IoT, governments 
should strengthen the legal and regulatory environment to ensure privacy, security, and the 
appropriate use of data collected from connected devices and develop business models to 
sustain the required high-capacity infrastructure. Managing disruptive technologies requires 
superior managerial and technical skills both in the public and private sectors.

DUBAI ROADS AND TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY
IoT has been used to reduce traffic congestion in Dubai. In 2014, the Dubai Roads and Transportation Authority (RTA) 
created 29 smart transport initiatives, ranging from smart bus stations to journey planners to building the city’s ability 
to optimize transport, streamline services, and improve the lives of its residents using IoT. Among the initiatives is a 
smart parking system that identifies open spaces in real time. Using a network of 2,000 sensors installed in public 
parking, multilevel lots, and shopping malls, motorists can use an app to locate open slots. Since Siemens estimates 
that the search for parking is the cause of as much as 40 percent of all inner-city traffic worldwide, this initiative reduces 
congestion while saving drivers’ time.

TRANSFORMING TRADITIONAL SECTORS WITH BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGIES
Blockchain is another disruptive technology that is beginning to transform industries, 
reconfigure financial processes, and create new markets. Blockchain is a type of distributed 
ledger technology (DLT) that is a cryptographically secure, decentralized, distributed, 
tamper-resistant ledger. Along with other DLTs, blockchain has the potential to reduce 
costs across global value chains.
Recognizing the benefits of blockchain, the Dubai government recently announced a 
comprehensive blockchain strategy to help its agencies run more securely and efficiently, 
with projected savings of US$1.5 billion per year.40 Estonia developed a scalable blockchain 
solution to protect the integrity of data stored in government repositories against cyber 
threats.41 In 2016, the Estonian E-Health Foundation launched a development project using 
blockchain as an additional layer of security to help ensure the integrity of patient health 
records.42
One of the most interesting blockchain applications is emerging in the area of land 
registries. Over the last few years, pilots have been conducted in Russia (Rosreestr), the city 
of Dubai (ERES/ConsenSys), Georgia (Bitfury), Ghana (BenBen), and Sweden (Chromaway) 
to test blockchain technology’s applicability in the land sector.
Blockchain solutions challenge traditional business and government models. As a DLT, 
it can operate without the need for a central authority, partially or entirely replacing the 
authority of the government in identity authentication, certification, land titles issuance, 
health records storage, social security benefits management, and voting and civic 
participation management.43 For a blockchain-based solution to work effectively, other “off 
chain” issues need to be kept in mind. Policy makers and regulators should establish an 
appropriate framework to ensure the security of private blockchains. In addition, adequate 
capacity should be built to promote the understanding of blockchain advantages and 
disadvantages, manage data storage (particularly ownership history), and address issues of 
customary ownership and legal recognition of blockchain transactions.

DUBAI REAL ESTATE BLOCKCHAIN
The Dubai Real Estate Blockchain links the Dubai Land Department (DLD) with other government agencies (for example, 
utilities), commercial banks, developers, and brokers to create a one-stop-shop solution for citizens and businesses, 
thus increasing the security and transparency of records and transactions and providing accurate real-time real estate 
information in a market that is worth close to US$75 billion. As of March 2018, the DLD platform has already placed 
0.5 million titles and 1.5 million records on the blockchain. Additionally, roughly 250 titles are created daily on the 
blockchain. The DLD is planning to launch services that are based on smart contracts or self-executing programs 
encoded on a blockchain that are triggered once predefined requirements or conditions are met. The DLD’s planned 
services include smart checks for payments, smart mortgages integrated with smart sale contracts and commercial 
banks, and smart escrows to oversee real estate transactions while reducing the risk taken by transacting parties.23 COMPETING IN THE DIGITAL AGE: RUSSIA DIGITAL ECONOMY REPORT
DISRUPTIONS BY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AI systems such as robots, autonomous vehicles, computer vision, natural language 
processing, virtual agents, and machine learning are increasingly used to deliver benefits 
in retail, electric utilities, manufacturing, health care, and education. AI can help improve 
forecasting and sourcing, optimize and automate operations, develop targeted marketing 
and pricing, and enhance user experience. The most promising applications of AI are 
machine learning and deep learning, where algorithms are created and iterated from a 
collection of data. Accenture estimates that AI uptake can double economic growth rates 
by 2035.44 Recognizing the tremendous opportunities of AI, digitally advanced countries 
are investing in AI R&D, with China taking the lead in this space.
Public sector applications of AI are growing worldwide. Early experiments used AI to 
make government agencies more efficient, improve public servant job satisfaction, 
and increase service quality. Governments are using AI, for example, to make welfare 
payments and immigration decisions, detect fraud, plan new infrastructure projects, 
answer citizen queries, adjudicate bail hearings, triage health care cases, and establish 
drone paths.45 The potential benefits of AI are perhaps greatest in health care, given AI’s 
ability to discern patterns in the vast amount of data generated by patient analysis, R&D, 
retailers, and caregivers. For example, IBM Watson for Oncology is a cognitive computing 
system that uses deep learning technology to read health care data and help identify 
individualized treatment options.46 McKinsey Global Institute estimates that optimizing 
innovation, improving research and clinical trial efficiency, and developing new tools to 
individualize treatment could generate up to US$100 billion revenue a year in the United 
States alone.

Policy makers should prepare for the next wave of AI growth. As McKinsey highlighted in 
its recent study,47 many of the challenges of AI are global in nature, but the implications for 
specific governments vary across countries. Concerns about ethics, morality, values, potential 
risks of labor disruption due to automation, algorithmic bias, privacy concerns, and security 
have all been identified as fundamental issues by the WEF.48
GROWING DEMAND IN QUANTUM COMPUTING
Quantum computing is among the most far-reaching and challenging of disruptive 
technologies. Through quantum computing, machine learning could scour enormous datasets 
of video or audio, find new ways to isolate risk and improve financial models, simplify 
complex chemical reactions to yield new biomedical innovation and research, and analyze 
supply chains to optimize shipping routes or logistics processes and eliminate bottlenecks 
and delays.49 It can also be used to solve very large prime numbers needed to develop 
bulletproof cryptography or decipher highly encrypted communications.50
Quantum computing has been hailed as an industry changer, offering unfathomable 
computing power and opening the door to new applications through quantum effects.51 The 
first company to sell a commercially available quantum computer was D-Wave Systems, 
a Canadian firm backed by Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP) Investments, 
Goldman Sachs, NSA, and Jeff Bezos. Major tech companies such as Google, Microsoft, 
and IBM have now entered the field. Google tested the D-Wave Systems in 2013 but is 
concurrently developing its own quantum system. Microsoft set up Station Q at the University 
of California, Santa Barbara, to research topological quantum computing. IBM has made 
quantum computing available on its cloud since 2016 and developed both a machine capable 
of breaking the barrier between quantum computing and traditional supercomputing and IBM 
Q, a division developing quantum computing for commercial and scientific uses.
At the same time, governments in various countries have started investing considerable 
resources in quantum computing. For instance, the EU’s Future and Emerging Technologies 
(FET) program was launched to promote quantum technologies aiming to transform Europe’s 
academic achievements into competitive advantage.52 Recently the Chinese government has 
built a 2,000 km link between Beijing and Shanghai to test quantum cryptography. A public-
private sector partnership between technology titan Alibaba and the Chinese Academy of 
Sciences is developing a quantum computing prototype of 50 to 100 qubits by 2030.53
2.3 The Data Revolution
Data fuel the growth of the digital economy, where they are constantly produced by sensors, 
mobile devices, digital cameras, social networks, digital platforms, and so on. Data have 
grown exponentially in recent years.54 The United Nations (UN) describes high-quality data as 
“the lifeblood of decision-making and the raw material for accountability.”55 Data management 
transforms business models through increased personalization of services and products, 
communication, asset sharing and collaboration, and usage-based pricing.56 The explosion 
of data requires new ways of data management not just at the company or organizational

level but across the full spectrum of economic, social, and cultural interactions as the “data 
continuum” spans the public and private sectors as well as society at large.
The explosion of data also poses increasing threats to privacy, safety, and national security. 
Cybercrime costs the global economy some US$400 billion in annual losses through 
consumer data breaches, financial crimes, market manipulation, and theft of intellectual 
property.57
Government policy makers should carefully consider the risks of data theft and fraud and 
adopt effective consumer protection laws and appropriate supervision and enforcement 
mechanisms.
The EU has launched an initiative to build a data economy, promoting data-driven innovations 
to harness the opportunities from data and analytics. The EU is currently enhancing its data 
policies and laws and encouraging investment, aiming to more than double the value of the 
European data economy to reach 4 percent of EU GDP by 2020,58 mainly through improved 
analytics and processing of data.
DATA ANALYTICS FOR COMPETITION, PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH, AND INNOVATION
Data analytics are becoming fundamental to maintaining competitive advantage. The latest 
global survey on data and analytics indicates that more and more companies are using data 
and analytics to generate growth.59 It is expected that worldwide revenues for big data and 
business analytics (BDA) will grow to more than US$203 billion in 2020.60 By leveraging the 
value of aggregated data, companies are changing their core business functions, marketing, 
and sales practices, developing new business models, providing new services to their 
customers, and even directly selling data-enabled products. For example, China’s Tencent 
built a big data platform that can access information from different applications such as QQ, 
WeChat, video, and games in real time.61 Big data and predictive analytics are transforming 
service industries by creating innovative information products and services, to increase 
productivity across all economic sectors through improved business intelligence.
Moreover, predictive analytic tools are helping to better address social challenges, improve 
research and accelerate innovations, and increase efficiency in the public sector through 
cost reductions and more personalized services. The city of Seoul used data to build a 
widely used and very popular late-night public transportation system, lowering commute 
times and improving user satisfaction.62 Big data and predictive analytics can be used by 
law enforcement to anticipate and prevent crime (for example, PredPol and HunchLab in the 
United States).
2.4 The Transformative Power 
of New Business Models
Disruptive technologies affect the fundamentals of economic activity. Three main trends 
are rapidly evolving in this space: the platform, the sharing, and the “gig” economies.

and adaptability translates into a high level of flexibility for producers and consumers, 
an emphasis on collaborative production, consumption, co-creation, and human 
relationships. New business models improve efficiency and the ability to reach global 
markets by leveraging communications and data processing capacity. At the same time, 
competition from new business models provide incentives to traditional businesses to 
innovate.
To benefits from these trends, policy makers should adopt effective consumer protection 
laws and appropriate supervision and enforcement mechanisms. Governments should 
also be actively involved in ongoing global and regional discussions on how to tax goods 
and services provided through digital platforms at the national, regional, and global 
levels. For instance, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD) has recently initiated public consultations on tax challenges raised by digitization 
and is seeking inputs on possible ways to address these challenges.63 Tax policy reform 
is being debated in the EU to address emerging digital economy taxation challenges and 
ensure a fair and efficient tax system for the digital single market.64
PLATFORM-BASED APPROACH IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS
The platform-based business model is now well accepted in both the private and public 
sectors. Governments in most digitally advanced countries, and some nongovernmental 
organizations, are adopting the “government as a platform” (GaaP) approach to enable 
them to deliver innovative public services in more efficient and user-friendly ways. 
In the United Kingdom, the Government Digital Service has adopted this approach, 
allowing government agencies to build faster and cheaper digital services for citizens 
and business; currently, more than 100 services across 26 government departments 
and agencies are using GaaP tools, components, and guidance.65 Equipped with this 
new business model, “government acts as an intermediary—orchestrating participants, 
facilitating collaboration, connecting people and providers, and ultimately, overseeing 
public service delivery models that will advance beyond what we can even imagine 
today.”66
E-commerce platforms are giving small businesses access to regional and global markets 
and connecting customers and suppliers in other countries. They facilitate the creation of 
new jobs and help generate economic benefits. It was estimated that the value of cross-
border e-commerce will grow to US$994 billion in 2020.67 Unprecedented opportunities 
exist for start-ups, which can more efficiently promote their products and services and 
process payments through platforms provided by big companies. According to a recent 
study,68 176 platform companies already represent US$4.3 trillion in market capitalization 
worldwide through the value-creating power of their platform ecosystems and digital 
assets. It is expected that platform-driven interactions will enable approximately two-
thirds of the US$100 trillion value at stake from digitalization by 2025.69 China’s TaoBao 
is an example of the way digital platforms contribute to inclusive economic growth by 
creating new jobs not only in cities but in rural areas as well and enabling previously 
excluded populations to engage in economic activity (Box 2.5).

NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FROM THE SHARING ECONOMY
Sharing economies operate via consumer-to-consumer transactions through an online 
platform, website, or app, in which access is temporarily provided to a good or service 
with no transfer of ownership.70 The sharing economy model helps individuals better 
utilize assets such as homes or cars, providing unprecedented business opportunities and 
reducing the need for ownership, and generates broader benefits by lowering transaction 
costs for consumers and delivering better-quality products and more convenient 
services. According to the U.K. Secretary of State for Business, Innovation, and Skills, “the 
contribution to the wider UK economy of this sector goes far beyond just an economic 
one – it’s creating new networks within communities and having a positive impact on the 
environment by using resources more efficiently.” In the United Kingdom, it is estimated 
that the sharing economy, worth £0.5 billion in 2014, will be worth £9 billion to the U.K. 
economy by 2025.
THE GIG ECONOMY: CHANGING THE NATURE OF WORK
The gig economy, characterized by an abundance of short-term and temporary positions 
staffed by independent contractors, often arranged remotely via digital platforms, is 
changing the nature of employment. The arrangement has potential benefits for both 
organizations and contractors. Independent work enables people to work flexibly and

ENABLING INCLUSIVE GROWTH THROUGH DIGITAL TRADE PLATFORMS IN CHINA
In China, the giant platform company Alibaba hosts 
Taobao, the world’s largest online marketplace for peer-
to-peer (P2P) buying and selling. This approach has 
produced a curious side effect in China: small, previously 
ignored rural areas found new life as producers and 
sellers of goods on the platform. China’s massive 
investments in rural connectivity and the sheer scale 
of Taobao have created millions of new jobs, in effect 
becoming a new strategy to rebuild the countryside and 
integrate it into the digital economy.
Alibaba designates “Taobao Villages” as those where 
at least 10 percent of households are actively running 
online outlets and netting e-commerce sales of more 
than CNY 10 million (US$1.58 million) per year. Alibaba’s 
research arm Ali Research reports that in China today 
there are 2,118 Taobao Villages and 242 townships 
that include three or more Taobao Villages. Two-fifths 
of merchants are female and one-fifth were previously 
unemployed. These home industries make trinkets to 
sell on Taobao: a variety of items ranging from theater 
costumes to handicrafts, bicycles, and shoes. They are 
driving the rejuvenation of areas previously hampered by low incomes, an outflow of labor, and poor infrastructure. 
Taobao’s platform and ecosystem keep fees low, reduce 
the cost of advertising, and enable quick delivery. 
Online ratings, escrow services, and conflict resolution 
mechanisms build online trust. The increased sales 
volume has created new jobs for rural population, 
enticing villagers to return from large cities to take 
advantage of rising income rates.
Due to their success at providing jobs and reducing 
poverty, Taobao Villages are now a national policy 
priority in rebuilding rural China. In 2016, the State 
Council Office on Poverty Alleviation joined 16 
other ministries in calling for a massive expansion 
of e-commerce in rural areas as a poverty reduction 
strategy. Some local governments have sponsored 
training classes, provided low-cost loans, and 
encouraged hiring locals who are below the poverty 
threshold.a Alibaba has also offered its support, investing 
CNY 10 billion to build 100,000 service centers in remote 
areas, expanding logistics and last-mile buildout, and 
assisting young people to start their own businesses.b

specialize, increasing work productivity. Companies that may not need or be able to afford 
employees for specialist roles can engage freelance experts as needed. The gig economy 
also provides potential opportunity for previously excluded populations, such as women, 
people with disabilities, the unemployed, and those living in remote areas—to access 
employment.
In some countries, governments have taken the lead in helping unemployed and low-
income individuals to take advantage of opportunities provided by the gig economy. 
Increasingly, digital platforms such as TaskRabbit, Upwork, Freelancer.com, and 
Thumbtack create efficient online marketplaces to connect organizations seeking to hire 
with professionals looking for contracts. A recent estimate suggests that up to 162 million 
individuals in the United States and the EU are engaged in independent work.71 To prevent 
exploitation, issues of worker protection, income security measures, benefits, access 
to credit, and training and credentials must be solved. Training initiatives will also be 
necessary to integrate low-skilled workers into the gig economy.
ADDRESSING THE CHANGING NATURE OF WORK
The changing nature of work makes it important to develop a strategic approach to 
managing the workforce of the future. Increasing automation of organizational and 
decision-making processes, in both public and private sectors, has given rise to a major 
concern that large numbers of low-skilled and even semi-skilled jobs may be eliminated, 
with resultant unemployment or underemployment.
To be well prepared for the outcomes of digitization, coordinated decisions and actions 
are needed from governments, the private sector, and educational and training institutions. 
This requires innovative ways to help workers adjust to fast-moving labor market shifts 
due to automation and other types of technology disruption. This could be achieved 
through organizational restructuring, investments in people and infrastructure, building new 
relationships inside and outside the organization, and overcoming resistance to change. 
Expected positive impact can be produced through significant transformation of processes 
and organizations as well as changing managerial mindsets. By creating a culture of 
rapid yet sustainable change, organizations are turning technology-driven disruption into 
business advantage.
At the same time, it is also expected that new technologies will create entirely new 
categories of jobs that will require a combination of digital and soft skills such as critical 
thinking, problem solving, creative design, digital marketing, and data analytics. In

particular, the central role of big data in the economy is creating a significant need for 
new jobs. Policy makers and business will need to meet the challenge of designing and 
implementing innovative education programs and new models of training and retraining.
Governments should encourage new forms of technology-enabled entrepreneurship 
and intervene to help workers develop skills best suited for the automation age. The full 
potential of data and analytics cannot be realized without appropriately skilled data experts 
and those who have been termed “business translators,” whose task is to turn analytical 
insights into profit and loss impact.
In addition, data visualization is an increasingly important skill set, particularly for data 
scientists and business translators, requiring visual design skills as well as experience 
in creating effective user interfaces.72 Governments should use the tools of the digital 
economy: strategic foresight, big data, and AI for predictive analytics—to identify demand 
for new jobs and inform the design of new education programs to meet the needs of 
future employers. Given the growing demand and existing shortage of data experts, 
governments should also work with the private sector to ensure that such gaps are filled, 
establishing new institutions along with new education and training possibilities. The 
Singapore government recently launched Big Analytics Skills Enablement (BASE)73 in 
collaboration with public and private sector partners to develop the future workforce of 
data professionals.

MEASURING THE IMPACT OF THE DIGITAL ECONOMY
Internationally comparable statistics on the digital 
economy combined with robust cross-country analyses 
are crucial for developing and implementing effective 
evidence-based policies. The WEF has consistently 
engaged in monitoring the development of the 
Information Society and, more recently, the digital 
economy. The World Bank in collaboration with the IIS 
has developed a DECA methodology to help countries 
and regions assess their readiness for digital adoption. 
To maximize the benefits of digital transformation for 
innovation, growth, and social prosperity, the OECD is 
constantly refining its measures of the digital economy 
and member countries’ capacity to reap the benefits 
of digital transformation. It recently incorporated 
measures to assess the barriers to entrepreneurship, 
trade, and investment and the degree of restrictiveness 
of regulations on telecommunications, professional 
services, retail trade, and international trade.
Recognizing concerns that existing macroeconomic 
statistics may not fully capture the gains from digital and 
digitally enabled products or cross-border transactions, the International Monetary Fund recently initiated 
discussion among policy makers, researchers, and the 
business community on how to measure the digital 
economy.b Some of the unresolved questions are how to 
assess the contribution of the sharing, platform, and gig 
economies to GDP and productivity growth.
Digitally advanced countries are also addressing the 
issue of impact measurement. The Chinese National 
Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released an index of China’s 
digital economy.c The Republic of Korea plans to add 
the digital sharing economy to its GDP measure in 
2019.d The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is 
developing tools to better capture the effects of fast-
changing technologies on the U.S. economy and on 
global supply chains. The BEA wants to calculate the 
digital economy’s contribution to GDP and improve 
measures of high-tech goods and services, international 
trade, the sharing economy, and free digital content and 
to explore economic measures beyond GDP to better 
understand the contribution of the digital economy to 
well-being in general.e

2.5 Implications for Policy Makers 
and Recommendations
Given the pace of technological disruption, policy makers should prioritize investment into 
scalable digital infrastructures investments that anticipate demand while at the same time 
focusing on strengthening non-digital foundations for digital transformation. Strong public 
and private sector leadership and cooperation is required to deal with new challenges as 
they arise and to create mechanisms to foresee future opportunities and crises. An agile 
regulatory environment, connected and adaptive institutions, and a proactive approach 
are prerequisites for catalyzing digital innovations, nurturing talent, and ensuring targeted 
investment. Specifically, policy makers should consider the following recommendations:
 ●Adopt a strategic foresight approach to scenario planning, horizon scanning, and 
prioritizing technologies that are likely to become important and may offer significant 
opportunities or present significant risks.
 ●Boost collaboration between the public and the private sectors for uncovering where 
the most significant bottlenecks are, designing the most effective interventions, 
periodically evaluating the outcomes, and learning from the mistakes being made in 
the process.74 Experiment with public and private sector regulatory sandboxes and 
“Challenge Tenders” (for example, Israel’s Ministry of Health). Several countries have 
started to experiment with actively breaking down siloed government structures, 
creating innovation and co-creation-oriented horizontal structures, and appointing Chief 
Data Officers to manage the explosion of data and the emerging cross-sectoral “data 
continuum.”
 ●Increase the agility of regulation and institutions. Encourage cross-sectoral policy 
making between government agencies to translate strategic foresight into actionable 
policies and projects. Agile approaches are already being mainstreamed for digital 
government initiatives, for example, in the United Kingdom (Government Digital Service). 
In the private sector, ING Bank, for instance, has put in place an organizational model 
with a focus on agility.75
 ●Review legacy laws and regulations that obstruct digital 
adoption and cross-border business and prevent the 
emergence of new digital technologies, new business 
models, and services.
 ●Update competition policies to support platform-based 
business models, multi-sided markets, and network 
effects76 with special attention to guarantee consumers choice, lower prices, and high 
quality of new Internet, broadcasting, and transmission services.
 ●Strengthen cybersecurity through the development of a cybersecurity ecosystem 
focused on implementing a cybersecurity strategy, 
mitigating cyberattacks, strengthening cybersecurity in 
the critical sectors, and ensuring effective coordination 
and deployment in response to cyber threats, as well as 
education and outreach programs. Adopt a secure-by-
design approach.
 ●Develop a mechanism to address ethical issues.
 ●Strengthen the digital innovation ecosystem. Encourage 
VC investments and crowdfunding of innovative start-
ups. Create sandboxes to enable high-tech companies

to experiment within a well-defined space and duration without fear of breaking laws 
and with safeguards to limit the consequences of failure and maintain the stability of the 
technology-enabled systems.
 ●Invest in the future digital economy workforce. Develop a mechanism to identify demand 
for new jobs and inform the design of new education programs to meet the needs of 
future employers. Support SME growth to drive new jobs creation and remove barriers 
to cross-border digital flows.
 ●Improve tools for measuring the impact of the digital economy.

STRATEGIC FORESIGHT BEST PRACTICES
Many digitally advanced countries, including Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, France, 
Finland, and others, have established strategic foresight agencies to track risks and opportunities ahead and develop 
or maintain their competitive advantage. One of the best examples of the use of strategic foresight by governments 
is that of Singapore. Strategic foresight in Singapore is anchored in the Prime Minister’s Office and is tightly coupled 
with the planning, budgeting, and implementation process. In response to the fourth Industrial Revolution, Korea has 
recently adopted a Master Plan for the Intelligent Information Societya and established a Joint Steering Committee for 
the Intelligent Information Society, comprising government ministries and private sector experts to better anticipate and 
manage the social and economic impact of rapid technological change.

82 Constantiou, Marton, and Tuunainen 2017.Digital platforms enable transformation across all sectors of the economy. They empower 
the performance of ecosystems by enabling rapid and continuous communication, 
cooperation, and co-creation across organizations, borders, and time zones. While 
supporting this model for digital transformation across economic sectors, it is important to 
strike the right balance between the protection of national security and consumer interests 
and the support of the growth of digital platforms to gain digital dividends in all the areas of 
economic activity these platforms transform.
3.1 Global Trends in Digital Platforms
Digital platforms are “multisided marketplaces with business models that enable producers 
and users to create value together by interacting with each other.”77 Multi-sided platforms 
(MSPs) allow for members of each side to interact through tools that facilitate matching, 
searching, exchanging, and carrying out transactions.78 Platforms can be internal to a 
production process or supply chain based (enabling coordination between clients and 
suppliers) or multi-sided industry platforms, where “a platform leader pools external 
capabilities from complementors.”79 The total size of the global platform economy in 2016 
was approximately US$4.3 trillion, based on the total value of 176 platform companies.80
The impact of digital platforms on a global scale is often captured by their ability to displace 
and disrupt existing business models. For example, Airbnb created the equivalent of 257 
hotels for guests during the 2016 Olympics in Rio.81 Similarly, the value of crowdfunding as 
an alternative to traditional means of funding projects reached US$34.4 billion in 2015.
Digital platforms are the product of an evolutionary process mixing physical as well 
as market and behavioral enablers (Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2). Moreover, individuals 
participate in economic activities through privately owned resources such as assets and 
labor, which would otherwise remain idle, or participate in the ownership of privately owned 
assets in a shared mode, as in crowdfunded ownership of a real estate project. Platform 
business models allow for the “asset-as-a-service” mode, such as shared access to tractors 
and agricultural equipment. This is sometimes called collaborative consumption.82
Digital industry platforms aim at the aggregation of different players in a specific industry 
cluster or across industries. They facilitate the digitization of industry and the promotion 
of R&D, innovation, and technology transfer within a specific industry or firm. For example, CHAPTER 3

AstraZeneca has adopted an open innovation model that crowdsources research and 
innovation solutions across a range of scientists and technicians. A global community of 
researchers is activated around specific problem-solving tasks, without being formally 
integrated in AstraZeneca production or research facilities. Similar experiments have 
been launched by FIAT in Brazil and Procter and Gamble.
DIGITAL PLATFORMS CAN ALSO BE OWNED AND LED BY THE GOVERNMENT
In these cases, the ecosystem around these platforms (Figure 3.3) follows a hub-
and-spoke model, where particular applications and services are linked to an open 
architecture and open application programming interfaces (APIs) enabled by a 
government- managed digital platform. Digital identity platforms are examples of how a 
single platform related to a concrete government service (the provision of identification) 
can be used to develop a host of interdependent applications and services.
Platforms are both a disruptive and a creative force in many economic sectors and 
their influence is likely to spread. Successful platforms can be a source of competitive 
advantage, but they can also potentially suppress SMEs or crowd out competition. 
Platforms have also attracted the attention of regulators given concerns about labor 
practices (for example, the conflict between Uber and local taxi drivers), arbitration issues 
(measures for users to resolve online disputes), discrimination, taxation issues, and the 
risks involved in large platforms using the massive amounts of data they accumulate 
to manipulate and overcharge consumers.83 Thus, regulation to protect both service 
providers and consumers and prevent platforms from monopolizing entire sectors is 
important.
As noted in the Harvard Business Review, while in a traditional world strategy revolves 
around erecting barriers, in a world of platforms, while guarding against threats remains 
critical, the focus of strategy shifts to eliminating barriers to production and consumption 
to maximize value creation. To that end, platform executives must make smart choices 
about access and control.84
Policies should include tools that not only manage the sociopolitical issues surrounding 
platforms but also encourage the growth of platforms and support entrepreneurs creating 
or participating in them. Regulators should specify performance objectives rather than 
dictate behavior or manner of compliance that platforms must adopt, using available 
alternatives to direct regulation.

BOX 3.1
THE DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM
Gartner defines the digital ecosystem as an interdependent group of actors (enterprises, people, and things) sharing 
standardized digital platforms to achieve a mutually beneficial purpose. In 2017, Gartner surveyed 2,598 chief 
information officers (CIOs) across 93 countries, representing approximately US$9.4 trillion in revenue/public sector 
budgets and US$292 billion in information technology (IT) spending. One important conclusion from this survey was 
that enterprises that were more mature in their digital transformation process (the leading performers) were also more 
actively involved in leveraging the digital ecosystem. In fact, 79 percent of the survey’s top performers indicated that 
they participated in a digital ecosystem while far fewer average (49 percent) and trailing (24 percent) performers did.
a. Gartner 2017.39 COMPETING IN THE DIGITAL AGE: RUSSIA DIGITAL ECONOMY REPORT
In many countries around the world, platform companies face barriers to working in multi-
sided markets. Airbnb and Uber, for instance, have faced outright hostility and bans from 
numerous cities and countries around the world. Sometimes regulators are justifiably 
concerned about national security, taxation issues, public safety, and labor standards. 
However, outright bans may also be indicative of the challenges that 
regulators face struggling to understand the platform’s business model or of a 
desire to protect entrenched interests as exemplified by the resistance Uber 
and Airbnb are facing from traditional hospitality and transportation service 
providers. The inclination to overregulate may slow down economic growth 
and digital adoption, as is already evident in the EU where the desire to limit 
competition from foreign platforms has led to an overreliance on antitrust 
regulation and overshadowed the need to deregulate offline service markets and adopt 
SME-friendly privacy and taxation legislature to boost competitiveness. In many cases, 
policy responses from governments are not based on a fully considered cost-benefit 
analysis.
One of the solutions for this can be co-regulation. In the co-regulatory model,85 a variety of 
stakeholders, including companies and platforms, academics, think tanks, and regulators, 
gather and combine information from different sources to create timely and evidence-
based regulations. The main advantage of the co-regulation model is that it decreases the 
information asymmetry between platform operators, who hold essential data about their 
operations, and regulators who need these data to make informed decisions. This simplifies 
the regulatory environment by reducing barriers to entry into new sectors or services for 
platform companies.

Trust between buyers and sellers is an essential component of the platform economy and 
platform owners go to great lengths to demonstrate that they are secure, reliable, and 
transparent. eBay, for instance, provides an elaborate review mechanism, encompassing 
a range of techniques including one-sided reviews, multi-sided reviews, and third-party 
reviews. Much of this trust is earned through activities and features on the platforms 
themselves, but regulators have a role to play in building consumer/seller trust in platforms, 
especially ones that may not yet be very well known in markets they are trying to serve.
PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE, PAYMENT SYSTEMS, AND LOGISTICS
These are essential attributes for platforms to develop, in common with all elements of 
the digital economy. E-commerce platforms in particular cannot flourish in the absence of 
sound logistics.
Data policies are increasingly critical to manage digital businesses and platforms. An OECD 
report on key issues for digital transformation86 prepared for the 2016 G20 Summit in 
Germany includes recommendations on the importance of standards and interoperability, 
relevant legislature, and measurement tools, all of which are also needed for the promotion 
of effective digital platform operations.
Finally, it is important to consider international competition when regulating the platform 
economy. Data localization is one of the more widely used tools to control international 
firms operating within national boundaries and support local players. Data localization 
laws refer to requirements that “data about a nation’s citizens or residents be collected, 
processed, and/or stored inside the country, often before being transferred internationally, 
and is usually transferred only after meeting local privacy or data protection laws”.
Localization creates its own set of winners and losers in the domestic market. Defenders of 
localization laws cite national security, local cultural and historical context, and economic 
nationalism as arguments in favor of such an approach. Opponents see such laws as a 
major barrier to trade and competitiveness. As with most emerging technologies regulation 
issues, a balance should be found between protecting the interests of national security, on 
the one hand, and encouraging economic growth through digital adoption, on the other.
3.2 Digital Platforms in Russia
The May 2018 Presidential Decree emphasizes the critical importance of digital platforms as a 
key enabler of cross-sectoral digital transformation across the Russian economy.
The government has implemented a policy of data localization, which allows a degree of 
control over transnational companies operating in Russia and helps support the development 
of national players.
The revenue of Russian digital platforms exceeds US$17 billion with a value of about 1 per-
cent of Russian GDP. Digital platforms cover a range of sectors, including social networking, 
employment, tourism, construction, health, e-commerce, and so on (Figure 3.4).

3.3 Policy Recommendations
To promote the effective development of digital platforms as a key element of Russia’s 
digital economy, policy makers should focus on the key areas that affect digital 
development, including investment into a scalable broadband infrastructure, creation 
of an enabling and regulatory environment, and an effective data management policy. 
Additionally, digital platforms adoption requires:
 ●Investment into the development of national transport and logistics capacities that will 
significantly increase the use of digital e-commerce platforms and improve the quality of 
services;
 ●An ecosystem approach to the co-regulation of digital platforms in Russia, involving 
all the key players and stakeholders in the public and private sectors, as well as the 
academic community that will enable effective regulation of digital platforms and help 
regulators maintain an often-uneasy balance between ensuring national and public 
security and promoting economic growth through digital technologies;
 ●Policies aimed at building trust between digital platform participants and enabling safe 
and secure transactions, as well as effective arbitration and dispute resolution that will 
bring more participants to Russian digital platforms;
 ●Launch of open government-driven digital platforms to enable a variety of interactions 
between public and private sector players; and
 ●Stimulating the emergence of industry platforms as a mechanism for the digital transfor -
mation of traditional industry.

GLOBAL BEST PRACTICE 
FOR DRIVING DIGITAL 
TRANSFORMATION IN RUSSIA’S 
PUBLIC SECTOR
92 Di Maio, Mechling, and Howard 2014.Russia has achieved some impressive success in building a robust national broadband 
infrastructure enabling extensive mobile penetration and interagency interaction required 
for the provision of digital services through a single national portal. It has also made 
some early strides in transforming education, health care, culture, and social services. 
Barriers to digital transformation remain at the cross-agency level, and disparities still 
exist at the level of regions and municipalities. There is a need for strong leadership to 
ensure enhanced cooperation between federal, regional, and municipal governments, 
as well as the implementation of a data-driven GaaP approach for offering user-centric 
services. The transition to data-driven administration and the innovative use of emerging 
digital technologies such as data analytics, blockchain, IoT and AI will accelerate the 
transformation to the next level of digital government in Russia and create the foundation 
for future technological breakthroughs.
4.1 Digital Government – Global Best Practice
Digital transformation is disruptive, forcing governments around the world to rethink their 
role and operations from top to bottom. For many OECD countries, making progress in 
digital government has emerged as a top priority.
Digital government builds on previous e-government reforms and aims to enhance 
government services by leveraging new possibilities afforded by digital technologies 
so that government can better serve the public and create an enabling environment 
where its businesses and industry can be competitive. Going beyond simply enhancing 
government efficiency, transparency, and accountability, 
digital government involves a re-engineering of back-end 
processes that enable a digital workflow. It establishes 
horizontal integration across government, and close 
collaboration between government and businesses to 
ensure a balance of interests of all involved, particularly in 
the design of regulatory approaches. Most importantly, it 
deploys a user-centric model to the design and delivery of 
public services.92
The five stages of transformation to digital government have been visualized by Gartner as 
a transition from the initial stage of e-government to open government, onwards to data-
centric government that then evolves into a fully digital government and finally becomes 
smart government (Figure 4.1).CHAPTER 4
Government designed and operated 
to take advantage of digital data in 
optimizing, transforming and creating 
government services9347 COMPETING IN THE DIGITAL AGE: RUSSIA DIGITAL ECONOMY REPORT
In practice, however, the rollout of digital government across the world has faced a number 
of important limitations. In some cases, e-government initiatives have been limited to the 
digitization of existing government services rather than a fundamental remodeling to deliver 
better services to citizens, especially the underserved. In many cases, e-government delivery 
models have been driven by supply-based approaches. This has often been at the expense 
of users, with the deployment of complex and difficult-to-use platforms and resulting in low 
user satisfaction. There have also been persistent gaps in the deployment of digital services 
within and across government departments. The result is often a lack of cross-platform 
interoperability, which is a requirement for many businesses. Finally, the gap between 
efficient, digital, and interactive outward-facing government platforms and traditional, largely 
manual, back-end processes persists, failing to enhance efficiency as was initially envisioned.
As government transformation progresses toward further maturity, key principles of digital 
government as distinguished from e-government are emerging.  These include the following:
 ●Adopting a whole-of-g overnment approach that is digital by default
 ●Committing to a process of digital end- to-end (DETE)
 ●Building a user-centric service design
 ●Deploying services in a way that is device agnostic
 ●Ensuring that policy is data driven
 ●Promoting open data
 ●Adopting open standards and open source solutions
 ●Being open to innovation and disruption
Digital, by default, implies that all government processes should be performed digitally 
without resort to other means. Going digital, however, requires a substantial reengineering 
of administrative processes and digital by default is therefore closely linked with another 
principle.FIGURE 4.1  Digital Government Maturity Levels

DIGITAL END-TO-END
In the early days of digitalization, digital front-end infrastructure coexisted with traditional, 
paper-based back-office workflows. This discrepancy often resulted in procedural delays and 
red tape. By contrast, DETE ensures the production and circulation of digital documents and 
products at all stages as a standard administrative routine. Besides the obvious benefits of 
cost – and time-efficiency, DETE brings greater transparency and accountability, and makes 
possible the use of data analytics at scale, which in turn can give rise to major improvements 
in administrative processes. Fully digitized public services can also be delivered instantly: 
electronic visas for foreign citizens, for example, eliminate the need for physical distribution 
systems, enabling greater efficiency and transparency of process and almost instant delivery.
At its best, digital government is built on a user-centric service design. This principle is a 
radical departure from traditional procedures. It requires public officials to eliminate red tape 
to perform their duties and promotes horizontal cooperation and coordination between 
departments at federal, regional, and municipal levels. As the United Kingdom’s Digital 
Design Principles reinforce, users need to be at the center of this design:93
Essential to this change of mindset is a shift from one-size-fits-all public services to a more 
personalized approach, informed by data analytics that can predict customer needs based 
on past behavior and user preferences. This approach becomes even more possible and 
powerful when all things and people are connected to the Internet, as the IoT envisages.
User-centric design is closely associated with another key principle: device-agnostic service 
delivery. The digitization of the public service was initially designed around fixed computer-
based solutions. The rapid growth of mobile devices since the mid-2000s has changed 
the way people access the Internet and services. In fact, in most developed countries 
more people go online using smartphones and tablets than personal computers. Digital 
government reforms must consider this change, making digital portals that are mobile 
compatible. The design of ICT infrastructure must also adhere to cross-platform/cross-device 
connectivity to deliver integrated, user-friendly services to multiple channels, including mobile 
devices.
A key difference between initial models of e-government and digital government is the 
shift from simply placing services online to a data-centric approach. Central to this is 
understanding the role that data plays in supporting evidence-based policy decisions that 
shape administrative processes. Governments need to ensure that their services are demand 
driven and adapt to changing realities. This means that government services should not 
operate from a preset menu but on an iterative, data-driven approach capable of customizing 
services.94
In a world of limited government spending, smart predictive models that generate scenarios 
based on data-driven probabilities can help governments make decisions about where to 
allocate resources more rapidly and accurately. Such models, for instance, have been used 
by law enforcement agencies to predict crime. Using algorithms and GPS-enabled devices 
that track crime data in real time, police departments can deploy their resources to areas 
where crime is more likely to occur. Predictive analytics is also being used to track financial 
crime, tax fraud, and cyber-crime.

Disruptive technologies are transforming the private sector but also have significant 
potential to improve public services around the world. Blockchain and other distributed 
ledger technologies can be used to record and store transaction data in a high-quality form 
that is secure, efficient, transparent, and resistant to tampering. Governments worldwide 
are already experimenting with the technology for land registries, ID systems, and smart 
contracts. Because of their security and efficiency, government use of these technologies 
has the potential to enhance trust among users.
Similarly, machine learning and AI can fundamentally change administrative processes. 
They have already enabled effective chatbots that can be used in customer service and 
in generating automated answers to the most common questions. Social media and other 
messaging platforms also allow governments to communicate directly and inexpensively 
with large segments of the population, some of which are inaccessible through traditional 
means of communication. These technologies are not only effective but may also 
eventually eliminate the need for fixed assets such as call centers.
With the benefits of these technologies, however, there are also challenges. Some 
technologies and platforms demand a level of digital skill that may not be widespread 
in all countries. Others, like blockchain, are still relatively untested, with their scalability 
remaining to be proven. Privacy and data governance issues about data collection, storage, 
and sharing must also be addressed and resolved, but regulation and legislation lags 
considerably behind technological advances, thereby opening up governments and users 
to risks unanticipated in the past. All of these opportunities and risks need to be considered 
in a comprehensive fashion and in a way that builds on best practice.BOX 4.1
APPLIED DATA ANALYTICS IN ACTION: A CASE STUDY OF DUTCH VAT REFUND RISK MODEL
Over the past 20 years, the Dutch GDP has doubled, accompanied by a corresponding increase in refund claims for 
value added tax (VAT). With the volume of claims rising beyond its capacity to process, the Dutch Tax and Customs 
Authority (NCTA) has started to implement a new risk model that uses predictive analytics and social network analysis 
(SNA) to map and detect possible VAT-related fraud. SNA identifies connections between nodes (for example, 
executives, bank accounts, or contact information) and visualizes them as graphs. Using a predictive model based 
on historic data, these networks can be scored and weighted against risk scales, allowing human analysts to focus 
selectively on high-risk cases. In addition to SNA methods, the NTCA also uses models that predict the likelihood that a 
particular claim will be fraudulent or incorrect. For the NTCA, data analytics are valuable in both revealing areas of risk 
and allowing more efficient allocation of human resources for detailed forensic investigations.

USE OF BLOCKCHAIN IN SWEDEN’S LAND REGISTRY
Sweden’s Lantmäteriat (land registry) is currently in the third phase of testing a blockchain land title system that 
integrates smart contracts into real estate purchases. Built on a private blockchain accessible only to parties to the 
contract, the system allows the process to be tracked digitally from the signing of the contract to the transfer of title by 
buyers, sellers, realtors, mortgage lenders, and government agencies. The end user interface is a mobile app through 
which parties can sign documents, review progress, and automatically receive electronic copies of documentation. In 
addition to being much more transparent, accurate, and secure than the existing system, the blockchain land registry 
will reduce processing times for land title transfers from four months to a few days and is expected to save the country 
more than €100 million each year.

BUILDING BLOCKS OF DIGITAL GOVERNMENT
Current evidence shows that governments need, as a basic foundation, four building blocks 
to successfully implement a digital government strategy:
 ●A unified data governance framework
 ●Re-envisioning GaaP
 ●A commitment to cybersecurity and privacy
 ●A culture open to innovation
UNIFIED DATA GOVERNANCE
Data will play a fundamental role in organizing administrative processes in the future. To 
effectively harness the potential of data, governments will need a robust data governance 
framework that includes three elements:
 ●Unified data governance, shared across the public sector
 ●A shared data infrastructure
 ●The use of advanced data analytics to turn data into smart policy and services
Efficient data governance requires the establishment of a unified data management policy 
that regulates the collection, storage, sharing, and reuse of data across government 
departments in accordance with established legal and ethical standards. The principle of 
unified data implies not only data characteristics but also an agile storage infrastructure 
that allows for prompt, secure updates supporting the once-only principle for data reuse. 
To ensure a unified approach, some countries have established the position of CDO, while 
others have chosen to create specialized agencies responsible for digitizing the public 
sector. In both instances, the mandate is to coordinate, control, and ensure a unified national 
approach to data governance.
Closely related to data governance is the idea of shared data infrastructure. This implies 
the modernization of government IT infrastructure, building standardized infrastructure 
components such as state-of-the-art data centers capable of processing unified data 
instead of investing in application-specific facilities. Cloud computing is an example of such 
BOX 4.3
BASIC DATA MANAGEMENT IN DENMARK
In 2011, the Danish government introduced the ‘Good Basic Data for Everyone - A Driver for Growth and Efficiency’ strat-
egy. The strategy included initiatives for data and registry optimization to promote reuse of data and prevent duplicative 
registration. Six types of databases were prioritized: maps, cadasters, business and company registrations, property, 
and address data. The government then analyzed all the databases and eliminated redundant registers. It then devel -
oped measures to ensure basic data complied with a unified standard that included cross-referencing to optimize 
interoperability and a set of IT solutions to establish a Common Public-Sector Data Distributor to convey updated infor -
mation from basic data registers to the relevant public or private-sector administrative field or business area.
Denmark then created a cross-governmental authority, the Agency for Digitization, responsible for the efficient use and 
development of basic government data. Technologies such as the eID and digital signature were mandated for stan -
dardized use. The program also created a national citizen portal as a single access point for all public services and infor-
mation, and NemHandel, an open e-business framework allowing businesses to send standardized electronic invoices 
in a secure and reliable way. Converting to a fully digital format yielded tangible benefits, reducing the cost of some 
services by as much as 50 percent.51 COMPETING IN THE DIGITAL AGE: RUSSIA DIGITAL ECONOMY REPORT
infrastructure that enabled governments to achieve a flexible, cost-effective, and rapid 
deployment of services. In 2012, Singapore introduced a government cloud service (G-Cloud), 
a private cloud infrastructure built in cooperation with SingTel and Hewlett Packard.
The third component of data governance is the use of advanced data analytics to gain more 
value from collected information and increase the productivity of the public sector through 
IoT. Advanced data analytics are being used to support road traffic control and public transit 
through sensors that adjust traffic signals to manage transit volumes in real time. They are 
also increasingly being experimented with in health care systems to manage patients and 
supply chains.
GOVERNMENT AS A PLATFORM
The transition to GaaP is a critical leap in the transition to a smart government. GaaP is 
commonly referred to as “the use of digital technologies to support the resolution of 
collective action problems at various levels through shared software, data and services.”95 
The philosophy is to make data and decisions made by government open for use by others 
through a platform accessible by all.96 GaaP takes government past its role as a service 
provider and re-envisions it as an enabler of activities in the public space. The model 
encourages citizens to be active participants in policy making and in delivering digital 
government services with the state responsible for creating an ecosystem of participation.
Based on a private sector model, GaaP outsources to reduce costs and enhance efficiencies. 
The government’s role is to create the platform; deliver public services; maintain the 
infrastructure; and regulate, mediate, and oversee its use and the service delivery process 
including third-party applications. The platform should enable effective customization of 
public services and provide users with greater flexibility with respect to choosing and 
customizing government-enabled services.

DEVISING A STRATEGY FOR DATA-DRIVEN GOVERNMENT
Given the emerging importance of data as the driver of the next phase of government transformation, several countries 
have adopted some form of a national data strategy.
For instance, the U.S. Government adopted a Federal Big Data Research and Development Strategic Plan in 2016 to 
build a big data innovation ecosystem that helps develop new capabilities for government agencies and the nation at 
large. Korea’s recent Master Plan for the Intelligent Information Society defines strategies and priorities that focus on 
creating next-generation capabilities by leveraging emerging big data foundations, techniques, and technologies.
Given its great potential for impact, a national data strategy should highlight the importance of improving access to 
anonymous machine-generated data, facilitating and incentivizing the sharing of such data while avoiding disclosure of 
confidential data and minimizing lock-in effects. It should address the issues of data standardization, free flow of data, 
access to machine-generated data, liability and safety issues related to data, creation of data maps, providing support 
to data-matching services, and helping grow data exchanges and markets.
At the same time, cross-border dimensions of data should be properly considered as well. Cross-border data flows 
can improve economic efficiency, raise productivity and afford greater opportunities for digital enterprises. Regional 
approaches like the APEC Privacy Framework and Cross Border Privacy Rules (CBPR) and the EU’s Binding Corporate 
Rules (BCR) aim at dealing with privacy in a regional context.GLOBAL BEST PRACTICE FOR DRIVING DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION IN RUSSIA’S PUBLIC SECTOR  52
Essential components of GaaP include the following:
 ●Open government data, which is collected, processed, and stored in a coherent and easy-
to-use format
 ●Access to data, through open APIs
 ●A set of rules that regulates access and use of data produced and provided through the 
platform
In some cases, governments also allow third-party applications to “write” into government 
databases: the U.K. Verify Service, for example, gives permission to trusted intermediaries 
such as banks to “write” transactions. Yet, overall the need to grant broad access to 
government databases remains an open question. GaaP puts into action unified and 
standardized solutions where users determine and shape how services are packaged and 
delivered, while the government enables and regulates where required.
CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY
Citizens will only use digital services if they believe there are sufficient protections in place 
to safeguard their personal information from threats outside government and misuse within 
government. Because trust is an essential component of the social contract between 
state and society, the acceptable risk threshold for governments is usually lower than for 
private sector actors. As a result, citizens expect that governments will adopt best-practice, 
rigorous, and ethical cybersecurity and privacy solutions instead of minimal, compliance-
based approaches.
A CULTURE OPEN TO INNOVATION
Digital government is about technology, but it is also about a culture shift. Those 
governments successful in their digital transformation have leadership that has promoted a 
culture change that enabled digital government. In Singapore, a commitment to digital has 
permeated all levels of government, and government officials are constantly experimenting 
BOX 4.5
JOINUP: AN EU COLLABORATION PLATFORM FOR DIGITAL GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS
Joinup is a collaborative platform facilitating the sharing and reuse of software, semantic assets, and other 
interoperability solutions developed for public administrations. It offers several services that aim to help e-government 
professionals share their experiences with each other. In the past, information on IT solutions for the public sector used 
to be scattered across numerous repositories and websites, making it hard to find data and to reuse already available 
tools. The European Commission answered this problem by establishing Joinup, a platform that gathers interoperability 
solutions and good practices, and gives everyone an opportunity to share and reuse them across Europe and beyond. 
Joinup is a single-access point to more than 2,800 interoperability solutions for public administrations, included in the 
collections of more than 40 standardization bodies, public administrations, and open source software repositories. It 
includes a catalogue where users can easily find and download already developed interoperability solutions (software, 
specification, data models). The interoperability solutions are described using the Asset Description Metadata Schema 
(ADMS). It provides freely reusable software under an open source licence. The platform allows developers to learn 
from best practices and experiences and collaborate with others. It facilitates communication and collaboration on 
common projects between public administrations, IT professionals, and academia. Users can share information about 
new developments, guidelines, events, or studies with others. News items are also provided by a professional team of 
journalists. Finally, Joinup can also be reused itself. The source code is available on GitHub for anybody interested in 
setting up a similar collaborative platform.53 COMPETING IN THE DIGITAL AGE: RUSSIA DIGITAL ECONOMY REPORT
with agile technologies and testing products using a sandbox approach. Risk taking and 
being open to change are fundamental to digital transformation. Sticking to hard-and-fast 
rules, as most governments are accustomed to doing, often proves counterproductive 
when making the transition to digital government.
These various building blocks are reshaping not only government-to-citizen (G2C) and 
government-to-business (G2B) interactions but also create new opportunities for business-
to-citizen and citizen-to-citizen and business-to-business interactions on the government 
platform. By committing to a unified data governance framework, re-envisioning GaaP 
supporting transparency and participation, committing to best-practice cybersecurity, and 
adopting a culture open to innovation, governments have managed to shift supply-driven 
approaches to user-centric service models enhancing client satisfaction and, in many cases, 
saving time and money.
4.2 Digital Government 
Transformation in Russia
Over the past two decades, Russia has demonstrated a strong commitment to adapting 
its government institutions to the new realities of the digital era. Along with the Public 
Administration Reform process (2003–2013), the government launched its first “Electronic 
Russia 2002–2010” program, aiming to adjust the regulatory capacity of the state and 
improve the efficiency of the public service through ICTs. Initial efforts focused on the 
development of an e-government infrastructure. This led to the establishment of the Unified 
Portal of State and Municipal Services (gosuslugi.ru).
The second phase aimed to build e-government in Russia, envisioned as an integral part 
of the “Information Society 2011–2020” program. This included the further development 
of single-window access for public services through a unified Portal of Public Services 
and multifunctional centers of services delivery, the creation of an interagency system 
for electronic interaction and a document management system, and open access to 
information on the activities of government bodies.
The Russia Digital Economy Program adopted in 2017 includes a special 
initiative on digital government to be implemented starting 2018 outlining 
the key directions to continue to implement digital government as well as 
to address the current weaknesses (such as the enabling environment) 
preventing the country from joining global digital economy leaders.
The May 2018 Presidential Decree emphasizes the need for accelerating the 
implementation of a platform approach in the provision of government services.
The ongoing focus on government digital transformation at the highest levels of government 
allowed Russia to rapidly ascend in international e-government ratings and achieve 
remarkable success. About 72.6 percent of Russian households enjoy broadband Internet 
access, with active mobile broadband penetration at 74.9 percent.97 Internet access is

Digital public service delivery has seen significant improvement, with citizens reporting high 
levels of user satisfaction, though commercial customers are less pleased. According to a 
2016 Rosstat survey, 66.1 percent of citizens are fully satisfied with the quality of public and 
municipal digital services, with another 32.4 percent partly satisfied.100 Russia has also done 
well in setting the stage for open government.
In terms of transitioning to the next phase of digital transformation, Russia’s flagship 
achievement has been the development of an upgraded digital infrastructure capable of 
supporting a “GaaP” approach. Key elements include:
 ●A Unified Portal of Public Services that catalogues services by agencies, categories, 
as well as life events with more than 20 different options. The latter design reflects the 
user-centered services delivery principle of digital government. The portal also has a 
built-in capacity to process transactions, thus enabling a fully digital service delivery;
 ●A System of Inter-Agency Electronic Interaction (SMEV 3.0) with advanced functionality 
that addresses the need to unite federal and regional segments of digital government;
 ●A Unified Identification and Authentication System with a growing number of registered 
users;
 ● The Interagency Electronic Document Management system with a universal format and 
register for electronic documents. The system reduces the time and costs of document 
circulation between government agencies. Most federal agencies participate in the 
system, yet the regional segment remains underrepresented;
 ●An extended network of multifunctional centers that can be used for developing the 
population’s skills in using the online infrastructure of the digital government;
 ● A system to authorize and verify electronic/digital signatures, thus contributing to the 
expansion of fully digital services;
 ●A well-developed and fully digital system of public procurement that provides the 
infrastructure for open and equal access to government contracts. The government has 
also appointed five digital marketplaces that can conduct the entire public procurement 
process digitally; and
 ●A system of state and municipal payments (geographic information system [GIS] GMP).
A Unified Portal of Public Services (www.gosuslugi.ru) has been the front office of Russia’s 
digital government since its inception in 2009, providing users with information, application 
forms, and payment services. It has undergone a series of revisions and upgrades, adding 
new technologies and functionalities as well as adjusting to the new user-centric principle 
of service delivery. The number of users has been growing steadily, although many still 
use the simple registration process (without verifying the identity in person), which limits 
the kind of services that are available to the user. To date there are some 70 million users 
registered, of which 57 percent (36 million) have verified their registrations. The percentage 
of Russians registered on the unified portal is comparable to rates in the United Kingdom 
and Australia.
To further improve, Russia will have to accelerate back-office transformation to increase the 
speed and quality of service delivery, incentivize ID verification to enable full functionality 
and adopt a more standardized approach to public service delivery, both horizontally 
(between agencies) and vertically (across different levels of government), thus erasing the 
legacy of earlier stages of e-government implementation. It will also have to develop a 
standard approach to data management, include data digitization, storage, management, 
and analysis.

As outlined in its “Strategy for the Information Society Development in the Russian 
Federation (2017–2030),” Russia has proposed the following objectives for the next phases 
of transformation to digital government:
 ●The development of a digital government infrastructure for federal, regional, and 
municipal administrations;
 ●The use of big data and advanced data analytics to improve public services;
 ●The use of new technologies to enhance public administration;
 ●The development of digital tools to enable the interactions between the government 
and the public at all levels of government while preserving the possibility of non-digital 
interactions.
To achieve these objectives, a significant transformation of the current e-government 
architecture will be required, including the reengineering of administrative processes and 
the emphasis on the use of national databases, the sharing of digital services between 
federal, regional, and municipal governments, and the provision of interactive digital 
government platform services to citizens and businesses and to enable the use of digital 
government platforms for direct citizen-to-business interactions. A few specific challenges 
will also have to be addressed.
REGIONAL DISPARITIES
A lack of interoperability across the different levels of government at the federal, regional, 
and municipal levels has resulted in disparities in the use of digital technologies. Today 
few local self-government organizations are in line with national digitization requirements. 
This persistent federal-regional-municipal divide has been negatively affecting the speed of 
government transformation in Russia.
The magnitude of the challenge is evident in the large number of municipalities including 
municipal districts, urban districts, and urban and rural settlements. Most municipalities do 
not have sufficient funds to finance ICT-related projects and rely on regional and federal 
contributions.
DATA GOVERNANCE ISSUES
Russia lags behind OECD countries in digitizing its databases. Civil registries were 
supposed to be fully digitized by 2015,101 but the process was delayed and has not been 
fully completed. Other challenges include data redundancy and the loss of sensitive 
data records such as land cadastral surveys and civil property registries in the process of 
amalgamation.102
Russia’s underperformance in these areas can be attributed to three factors.
First, there is a lack of prioritization of enforcing interoperability standards for effective data 
management at the municipal, regional, and federal levels. Second, the federal structure 
of government in Russia has in some cases led to the creation of parallel and duplicative 
databases at multiple levels of government. Finally, there are problems of data ownership, 
sharing, and management, as the current system creates few incentives for agencies 
to release data specific to their domain of interest. For digital government to succeed, 
effective data management at all levels of government is essential.

GOVERNMENT AS A PLATFORM IN RUSSIA
The implementation of GaaP in Russia is still in its very early stages. The website gov.ru 
aspires to reflect the federal nature of government and to provide centralized access to 
all federal-, regional-, and municipal-level services, yet today it remains largely a website 
offering links to other government websites. Back-end government transformation 
has also been slow, hampered by a lack of business process reengineering and data 
management challenges. The introduction of a system of interdepartmental electronic 
communication to support a digital workflow between government agencies and a 
system for identification and authentication of users on the government services portal 
with a broad network of authorization offices around the country has been a step in the 
right direction.
Going forward, it is important to make government services fully available online and 
support multiple channels for service delivery including mobile devices, call centers, 
and physical service points. The portal should evolve as a platform for public and private 
sector interactions including third-party applications.
G-CLOUD
With respect to cloud technologies, the government is in the planning phase and 
has committed to migrating 90 percent of data resources to the state cloud by 2024, 
but progress has been slow due to issues with data readability, conflicts between 
government agencies, and existing barriers in government procurement legislation, 
among other factors. Data remains unstructured and not conveniently accessible for 
stakeholders. This situation complicates the ability of external and internal users to apply 
advanced data analytics to build products and make evidence-based decisions. The 
regional segregation of databases also produces additional obstacles to optimization.
A CULTURE OPEN TO INNOVATION IN RUSSIA
The rapid emergence of new disruptive technologies requires the development of a 
pervasive culture of innovation, which is a challenge in the Russian government context 
where, as in most public administrations, innovation has not been sufficiently encouraged in 
the past. This is no longer an option and special policy measures have to be adopted and 
implemented at the highest level to encourage and stimulate innovation in the public sector 
at all levels of government.BOX 4.6
AGILE APPROACHES IN RUSSIA’S LARGEST PUBLIC BANK
Agile is an approach to quickly test hypotheses and deliver projects in a fast-changing IT environment. Sberbank, a 
state-owned Russian bank and the largest in the country, launched its Agile transformation process in September 2016 
with the goal of revolutionizing its end-user delivery process (time-to-market). Before introducing Agile, the average 
time to market for IT-related systems was several years. This delay meant that newly deployed systems were obsolete 
by the time they were deployed. Sberbank adopted Agile to cut time to market and help improve the design of their 
IT products in a way that reduced routine functions of staff and minimized the bank’s risks through active digitization 
of back-office processes. This led to the emergence of what has been called the ‘SberGile culture’ defined by cross-
functional teams, flat process structures with client-task-based teams. The result has been quick and continuous 
improvements in IT product development. As of March 2018, there are over 200 IT products in development and over 
11,000 employees engaged in the transformation process.57 COMPETING IN THE DIGITAL AGE: RUSSIA DIGITAL ECONOMY REPORT
4.3 Policy Recommendations
Solid progress has been made over the last few years, but given the accelerating rate 
of technological change, Russia’s strategy for the next phases of digital government 
transformation needs constant review and updating.
Achieving a leading position in digital government entails a full back-end digital 
transformation of the public sector, as well as delivering customized services to citizens 
and businesses through multiple channels that are trustworthy, transparent, effective, and 
efficient. The system will have to be data driven based on the principles of data sharing and 
collaboration across all levels of government, as well as the private sector and the public.
This vision is in line with the President’s address to the Federal Assembly in March 2018, 
calling for the digitization of the entire public administration system within six years. This will 
require revising the government’s strategy in a way that commits to establishing a culture 
open to innovation and a consideration of changes in how the system is governed.
To move forward substantively the government will have to address the following 
interrelated areas:
 ●Prioritize data and data analytics for a data-driven administration. Recognize high-
quality data as a reusable national asset and apply common data governance struc -
tures and data management principles. Commit to open data to increase public sector 
transparency.
 ●Implement GaaP delivering trusted, user-centric digital public services.
 ●Adopt a Russian Interoperability Framework at the federal, regional, and municipal levels 
and a federal government-wide enterprise architecture.
 ●Complete the rollout of the shared services and information resources of the digital 
government platform and make its usage mandatory for federal agencies.
 ●Adopt design guidelines for digital services incorporating user-centricity, digital-by-
default, security and privacy, data reuse, and interoperability as the key principles. 
Delivery of these services must be through the digital government platform and through 
multiple channels to address issues of digital inclusion.
 ●Leverage the new digital technologies (data analytics, AI, the IoT, blockchain) to upgrade 
and reengineer government services as well as build new services.
 ●Use secure cloud infrastructures for all platforms and services.
 ●Remove legal barriers relating to the procurement of usage-based services to allow the 
use of existing underused private sector capacity in cloud-related infrastructures. Best-
of-class security and 24/7/365 availability can form part of service-level agreements.
 ●Resolve conflicts between government agencies preventing the creation of an effective 
government cloud.
 ●Use hybrid public/private clouds to prevent issues of data confidentiality becoming 
obstacles to service delivery.
 ●Migrate all ministerial data centers to the government cloud.
 ●Drive a culture of innovation and digital skills for the public sector
— Prioritize middle and senior management training and launch change management 
to support a data-driven public sector.
— Develop a culture of effective data governance and data sharing across government 
agencies.
— Adopt international best practices to build a culture of innovation by setting up 
sandboxes and innovation hotbeds to encourage free-to-fail pilot projects.GLOBAL BEST PRACTICE FOR DRIVING DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION IN RUSSIA’S PUBLIC SECTOR  58
— Drive collaboration between the private sector, the public sector, and the scientific 
community at all levels.
 ●Ensure federal, regional, and municipal cooperation in a common Russian digital space 
with abovementioned characteristics
— Create a platform and sandbox for IT professionals to share standards, solutions, 
and test application.
 ●Prioritize digital transformation of education, health care, and culture and leverage big 
data and AI for maximum near-term impact.
Taken together, these cross-cutting and sectoral action areas should form the blueprint for 
the next phase of digital transformation of the Russian public sector.

GLOBAL BEST PRACTICE FOR 
ACCELERATING BUSINESS 
TRANSFORMATION IN RUSSIA
While traditional Russian industry, with the exception of a few leading enterprises, 
is generally lagging in digital adoption, its services sector, especially FinTech, is 
leapfrogging into the digital age. Russia should leverage lessons learned from local 
digital adoption leaders and international best practice to help late adopters across the 
rest of the economy and invest in entrepreneurship, innovation, and boosting digital 
skills.
5.1 Global Best Practice for Driving 
Russian Industry Transformation
To strengthen the competitiveness of its key industry sectors, Russia should leverage 
existing national initiatives such as TechNet National Technology Initiative (NTI) and 4.0 
RU to develop a single digital industry strategy that would present a vision for adopting 
emerging technologies to achieve industrial development objectives and to accelerate 
the creation of clusters of innovative companies and new drivers of economic growth. 
Engaging the private sector in digital transformation partnerships, driving top-down 
digital transformation of the large dominant state-owned enterprises (SoEs), fostering 
connections with the scientific and R&D community, prioritizing resources, and creating 
favorable taxation regulation to incentivize investments into digital technologies are all 
mechanisms to maximize breakthrough opportunities.
5.1.1 GLOBAL TRENDS IN DIGITAL BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION
As nations develop digital business transformation strategies, it is important to 
identify priorities from a sectoral perspective. The approach should be based on an 
understanding of the importance of the sector to support national competitiveness, on 
the one hand, and the relative ease of driving digital adoption in that sector, on the other.
For example, a recent Gartner survey of a cross-sectoral group of leading industry CIOs 
from more than 90 countries determined that the services sectors, especially the media, 
financial services, and telecom sectors, were the most receptive to digital adoption while 
natural resources extraction sectors were the least aware of the potential impact of digital 
transformation on their businesses (Figure 5.1).
In assessing existing levels of private sector digitization in Europe, McKinsey 
also points to strengths in the finance, media, and telecom sectors while 
assessing transformation of the mining sector as average and assigning a 
low index to agriculture, construction, and hospitality (Figure 5.2). It also 
points to a large remaining potential for the digital transformation of industry, CHAPTER 5

GLOBAL TRENDS IN DIGITAL INDUSTRY
Digital transformation of the industrial sector is key to building a digital economy and reaping 
digital dividends, that is, achieving measurable economic results through digital adoption.
Digital transformation of manufacturing and related traditional industry sectors is a priority 
for all industrial nations that have built their competitive advantage during the 20th century 
Industrial Revolution. Digital transformation of manufacturing should aim to boost efficiency, 
productivity, and the global competitiveness of the sector. Today, industry is undergoing 
massive changes caused by the adoption of intelligent systems prompting the convergence 
of the physical and digital worlds. These enormous technological changes are accompanied 
by the development of fundamentally new business processes at all levels.
At the national level, countries manage these changes through the deployment of large-scale 
programs such as the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership in the United States, Industry 4.0 
in Germany, “Factories of the Future PPP” in the EU, “Made in China 2025,” and so on.
At the sectoral level, industry transformation is characterized by the minimization of 
human involvement in the production process and the transition to effective data-based 
management. In addition to the broad implementation of ERP solutions, technologies driving 
the transformation of manufacturing into “digi-facturing” characterized by a total digital 
integration of production, logistics, and distribution supply chains include:
 ●Digital design and simulation as a combination of computer-aided design, engineering, 
simulation, optimization, and manufacturing with a special focus on additive manufacturing 
and the creation of smart models and smart digital twins;
 ●The use of new materials, especially composite materials, metamaterials, and metal 
powders for additive manufacturing;
 ●Additive technologies: additive manufacturing systems, materials, processes, and services;
 ●Industrial sensing: smart sensing and control systems embedded into manufacturing 
equipment, shop floor, or factory;
 ●Industrial robotics: primarily flexible manufacturing cells;
 ●Smart big data generation, collection, storage, management, processing, and transmission;
 ●IIoT;
 ●Virtual and augmented and mixed reality; and
 ●Expert systems and AI.
If taken separately, none of the advanced manufacturing technologies can provide a long-
term competitive advantage in the market. Complex technological solutions are required for 
the rapid design and production of a new generation of globally competitive products.
These solutions come together in the so-called Factory of the Future, which is a new 
production model based on a multidisciplinary “smart manufacturing” approach, which 
includes:
 ●Creating digital platforms that enable new ways of value creation through the use 
of advanced digital technologies. By leveraging predictive analytics and big data, 
the platform approach enables integration of spatially distributed designers and 
103 McKinsey Global Institute 2016.63 COMPETING IN THE DIGITAL AGE: RUSSIA DIGITAL ECONOMY REPORT
manufacturers and allows to increase flexibility and customization while fulfilling customer 
requests;
 ●Developing a system of digital models of both newly designed products and production 
processes. Digital models must have a high level of adequacy to physical products and 
actual processes enabling the convergence of the physical and digital worlds to generate 
synergy effects ultimately becoming digital twins; and
 ●Digitalizing the entire product life cycle, from concept and design to production, use, after-
sales service, and recycling.
Digital platforms are becoming the key competitive production asset that enables the 
efficiency and flexibility of the production process and ensures the seamless integration 
of Industrial Internet-supported smart machinery, cloud resources, security solutions, data 
analysis, and digital workforce with logistics and business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-
consumer (B2C) sales processes.
Digital factories span the product life cycle from the R&D and product planning 
stage to the development of a digital mock-up (DMU) and digital twin—and to the 
creation of prototypes and small-batch production. A digital factory uses big data 
analytics to create smart models of products (for example, machines, structures, 
units, instruments, and installations) developed through the application of the 
new paradigm of digital design and simulation called “smart digital twin".
The use of robotics in smart manufacturing reduces risks of human error, while 
the development of DMUs, smart digital twins, and prototypes dramatically drives down 
production and testing costs.
Virtual factories link digital and smart factories through a distributed network that allows 
developing and using virtual models of organizational, technological, logistical, and other 
processes to optimize global supply chains.
In addition to transforming supply chains and production processes, the spread of disruptive 
technologies leads to increased competition with other sectors in the digital age and the 
appearance of nontraditional competitors to entrenched industry giants. For example, given 
the emergence of data analytics as a key source of competitive advantage, the United 
Aviation Corporation (UAC), a leader in the Russian aircraft-building industry, sees itself 
competing globally not just with its aircraft-building peers but also with the likes of Google 
and Yandex, as well as RosNano, Sberbank, Tesla, and Space.104 UAC sees the aircraft 
construction process as a constant source of massive amounts of critical data.
NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL TRANSFORMATION STRATEGIES: THE CASES OF CHINA, 
GERMANY, AND THE UNITED STATES
Emerging evidence indicates that countries with specific strategies that identify how they 
will integrate and capitalize on emerging digital technologies to address opportunities 
and challenges across multiple industries are best positioned to succeed. Leaders include 
China, with its comprehensive “Made in China 2025” initiative; Germany, with its Industry 4.0 
strategy; and the United States, with its “Industrial Internet Consortium” (IIC).
In addition to shaping and capitalizing on digital technologies, these countries have 
developed policy and regulatory arrangements that are relevant for the digital transformation 
of industry in Russia, including ways to address competitiveness, productivity, local 
development, as well as skills and technology transfer (Table 5.1)
104 See http://uacrussia.ru/ru/corporation/, accessed July 27, 2018.Use of robotics in smart 
manufacturing reduces risks 
of human errorGLOBAL BEST PRACTICE FOR ACCELERATING BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION IN RUSSIA  64
The varying characteristics of each program demonstrate the range of choices available to 
governments as they invest in digital industry and the importance to develop strategies that 
emphasize unique comparative and competitive advantages. The scale of Chinese top-
down government investment into its industry transformation program compared to that of 
its U.S. and European counterparts is also noteworthy as it is indicative of a very different 
approach to the role of the government in driving digital industry adoption.
While China chose to focus on enhancing its global position in high-technology 
manufacturing and invest in skill development and R&D, Germany preferred to focus on the 
impact of emerging technologies to enhance productivity, increase efficiency, lower costs, 
and improve quality. The United States has decided to promote the creation of coalitions 
between leading industries to reduce barriers to the digital transformation of industry. As a 
consequence, the sectoral focus of the IIC is very broad, while the “Made in China 2025” 
strategy has precise, quantifiable objectives and targets.
China has adopted a top-down approach as the State Council sets the strategy through 
a 10-year plan. This clarity of purpose enables the Chinese government to mobilize 
resources at a scale that outpaces others, allowing for the acquisition of a range of tools 
and technologies as well as the acquisition of foreign competitors or companies. Germany 
adopted a blended approach combining private and public sector initiatives, while in the 
United States, the approach is extremely broad, platform based, and organic.TABLE 5.1  Digital Industry Strategies: China, Germany, and the United States

In terms of tools to implement the strategy, China expects the development 
of 15 additional innovation centers by 2020 and 40 centers by 2025. The 
Chinese state also aims to protect domestic industry through licensing, 
limitation of market access, and regulations. Funded with US$300 billion, 
“Made in China 2025” makes extensive use of preferential access to capital 
to Chinese companies to develop research and competitiveness, as well as 
purchase technology from abroad.
The Industry 4.0 program is part of larger initiatives in support of the industry coordinated 
with EU programs such as Horizon 2020. The German budget funding of Industry 4.0 is 
€200 million.
IIC test beds are funded by governments and industry in the context of mixed PPP models. 
The IIC is also related to several programs of funding of R&D efforts. “Made in China 2025” 
is a large-scale focused government effort to stimulate the growth of national players that 
may influence global competition in emerging technologies adoption.
Two important elements of the abovementioned strategic approaches are SMEs and skills 
development. The IIC initiative in the United States is technology driven and does not 
identify SMEs as a particular class of players.
5.1.2 DIGITAL INDUSTRY IN RUSSIA
Industry plays a central role in Russia’s economy, contributing more than 38 percent of GDP 
and employing a third of the labor force.
The structure of the manufacturing industry in Russia is split among manufacturing (65 
percent), mining (27 percent), and production/distribution of electricity, gas, and water (8 
percent).105 The past five years have been characterized by high variance in production 
rates by subsector with chemicals, food, and refined petroleum products exhibiting 
consistent growth, while other subsectors have seen production levels fall relative to 2012. 
Sectors such as machinery, metal products, and electrical equipment have exhibited the 
greatest decline in production (Figure 5.3).
The Russian economy continues to be highly concentrated in a few sectors. Despite the 
efforts to support a variety of sectors to increase the international competitiveness of 
Russian industry, its high-tech and manufacturing sectors remain laggards globally. This is 
compounded by the relative dependence of the Russian economy on the volatile oil and 
gas value chain.
The digital transformation of Russian industry is a top national priority, as discussed in the 
May 2018 Presidential Decree. Digital transformation of the processing industries as a way 
to boost exports has been given special attention in the decree.
But when it comes to the digitization of key Russian industries such as mining and pro-
cessing, with a few exceptions, for example, Gazprom, Russia lags behind its global peers 
(Figure 5.4).
While the overall level of digital adoption by Russian industry is lower than that of its global 
peers, Russian industrial leaders such as Gazprom, KAMAZ, the UAC, and several others 
have made impressive progress in digital adoption focusing on digital transformation as a 
strategic priority.106 Their experience should be broadly shared as national best practice 
in the digital transformation of Russian industry to enable late adopters to accelerate their 
pace of digital development.

Gazprom is driving the development of an industrial digital platform and believes in the 
huge potential of the digital industry platform market in Russia (which it estimates at 
US$2,27 billon) to transform Russian industries, increase the competitiveness of industrial 
corporations, and boost regional development, including growth in rural areas. It considers 
digital platforms to be a key asset that enables efficiency and flexibility of the production 
process and is aiming to achieve a total integration of the production and logistics supply 
chain as well as B2B and B2C sales through leveraging Industrial Internet technologies, IoT 
and smart machines, AI, data analytics, cloud resources, and a digitally enabled workforce.
KAMAZ (a leader in the Russian automotive industry) has launched a Digitization Program 
that includes the implementation of a corporate digital platform and a transition to digital 
design/engineering, digital production, digital supply chain, digital sales and service, 
digital management, digital technologies, and information management, as well as the 
development of a digital corporate culture. It is also focusing on maximizing the value 
of digital technologies adoption inside the automobiles it produces to increase the 
competitiveness of its products in the local and global markets, taking advantage of digital 
twin technologies and data analytics.
The UAC is a good example of a corporation committed to implementing a comprehensive 
digital transformation strategy anchored in an ecosystem approach that aims to achieve a 
transition to a new business paradigm and a transformation in corporate “thinking.” This 
process starts with the creation of normative documentation to foresee and manage the 
arrival of new technologies and continues with the development of a single corporate 
digital platform and investment into the digital training and education of its workers 
to enable them to collaborate across the digital ecosystem, insists on direct customer 
engagement in corporate digital transformation initiatives, and develops an effective 
mechanism for identifying and applying new technologies and solutions.
This ongoing innovation drive in search of new products and solutions is also anchored in 
an ecosystem approach. The UAC has created a network of 13 higher education institutions 
where it has established special UAC departments that are engaged in researching and 
testing new technologies and solutions. The UAC conducts regular competitions and 
hackathons aimed at designing innovative solutions for the future of aviation. It invests 
in the Skolkovo Innovation Fund in search of new products, works closely with the 
Russian Academy of Sciences, and has created a corporate sandbox for testing potential 
applications of new technologies in a risk-free environment. The objective is not only to 
maintain a competitive edge in local aircraft building, but also to become a leading provider 
of technology and data services that enable the creation of factories of the future across 
the Russian economy, as well as to compete globally with the likes of Google, Tesla, and 
Space X.
For the UAC, its main product, the aircraft, is no longer just a product but an ecosystem 
that allows the corporation to extract and manage data that are used for continuous 
improvement of the production process.BOX 5.1
PILOTING A DIGITAL INDUSTRY PLATFORM AT GAZPROM
Gazprom sees the development of a digital industry platform as one of its top strategic priorities. It has recently 
launched EvOil, an open digital platform, bringing together all the supply, production, and logistics partners to enable 
uninterrupted production management and expand its position in national and global markets. It has initiated the launch 
of this platform in the context of its digital factory pilot at a bitum production plant in Kazakhstan.GLOBAL BEST PRACTICE FOR ACCELERATING BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION IN RUSSIA  68
To accelerate the speed of digital transformation in the company, the UAC has created 
several new executive positions, which, in addition to the CIO, include the digital innovation 
leader, the digital technology officer, and the chief analytics officer.
Unfortunately, this kind of local best practice is not consistently applied across the 
manufacturing sector, with some 65 percent of industry players relying on legacy systems. 
While there are cases of end-to-end automation and partial digitization, the potential has 
yet to be fully realized.
Many Russian industries have not yet started to adopt emerging technologies, such as IoT 
and cloud computing, and have few digital security safeguards in place. The number of 
industrial robots per worker in the manufacturing industries in Russia is 20 times less than 
in China.
As McKinsey underscores, the lack of a digital culture within Russian industry also has 
the compounding effect of making companies unattractive to relevant specialists.107 With 
an inability to attract digital talent, companies simply do not have the ability to develop 
required digital tools, products, and services. This has had a negative impact on the 
competitive position of Russian industry.
In manufacturing, in 2016, Russia ranked 32nd among 40 countries (2016), far behind 
China, the United States, and Germany and down from being 20th in 2010 and 28th in 2013 
(Figure 5.5).108
The lack of focus on digital transformation is likely to further consolidate this downward 
trend in the future. If Russia is to reap the economic dividends of digital adoption, digital 
transformation of the industrial sector should be among its top national development 
priorities.

COMMITMENT TO DIGITAL INDUSTRY TRANSFORMATION
To help focus the country’s attention on digital industry transformation, a clearly articulated 
vision and strategy is required. Today there is no specific document to bring together 
the various policies and programs in support of digital industry in Russia, although critical 
building blocks toward the development of a comprehensive strategy are in place.
Support for digital development exists at the highest levels of Russian leadership. Examples 
include the adoption of the Digital Economy Program in 2017, and implementation of the 
initiatives such as TechNet NTI and 4.0 RU, which have been supported by the Ministry of 
Industry and Trade.
Russia has invested into building an ecosystem of research centers, initiatives, technology 
parks, and industry associations in support of digital industry. These include the “Strategy 
of Scientific and Technological Development of the Russian Federation” and the “Russian 
Technology Transfer Network (RTTN).” For example, the 2017 TechNet NTI Roadmap 
aims to develop a set of core competencies that ensures the integration of advanced 
manufacturing technologies and related business models into the next generation Factories 
of the Future to create new globally competitive high-tech manufacturing products.
Several leading Russian enterprises such as KAMAZ, UAZ, UAC, UEC-Saturn, Russian  
Helicopters, and others have been investing in the creation of digital factories in 
several sectors such as defense, aerospace, engine building, automotive, aviation, and 
shipbuilding, with a focus on computer-assisted mathematical modeling, virtual integrated 
supply chains, virtual testing, and so on.
In 2016, the autonomous noncommercial organization, Agency for Technological 
Development (ATD), was created. The agency was established to promote Russian 
enterprises to implement world-class technology solutions with the goal of making 
BOX 5.2
4.0 RU AND TECHNET NTI
4.0 RU envisions a single digital space to support Russian industry. The concept is the product of a joint initiative 
championed by the Ministry of Industry and companies such as ITELMA, Kaspersky Lab, Siemens, and STAN. 4.0 
RU aims for integrated digital technology adoption at all stages and levels of industrial production. The objective 
is to shorten the time to market for new products, increase production flexibility, enhance product quality, improve 
production process efficiency, and stimulate innovation through new technologies with the ultimate effect of enhancing 
the competitiveness of Russian industry.
TechNet is an action plan produced by the NTI to support “advanced manufacturing technologies.” The action 
plan was approved by the Presidium of the Presidential Council for Economic Modernisation and Innovative 
Development. TechNet promotes technologies including digital design and modeling, new materials, additive and 
hybrid technologies, robotics, sensors for industrial applications, Industrial Internet, big data, information systems for 
production management and enterprise, virtual and augmented reality, and AI. TechNet aims to enhance the global 
competitiveness of Russian high-tech industries, push forward advanced manufacturing technologies through long-term 
planning, and create an ecosystem that can support and sustain best-in-class technology transfers and development 
and the creation of an institutional and legislative environment that is conducive to the growth of the digital industry. 
It is expected that TechNet NTI will increase Russia’s share in global markets of engineering and design by some 1.5 
percent by 2035. The value of exports of products created using advanced manufacturing technologies is expected 
to increase by RUB 800 billion (in 2016 prices). Forty “Factories of the Future,” 25 testbeds, and 15 experimental-
digital certification centers (laboratories) are scheduled to be created. These solutions made up of the best world-class 
technologies and proprietary cross-industry know-how are referred to in the TechNet NTI Roadmap as Digital, Smart, 
and Virtual Factories of the Future.GLOBAL BEST PRACTICE FOR ACCELERATING BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION IN RUSSIA  70
domestic products competitive. The agency has a broad mandate ranging from 
technological research to the introduction of finished projects on the Russian market.
There is also a rich infrastructure of science and technology parks. Today there are 747 
such parks, 50 percent which are private, 46 percent public, and 4 percent operating under 
a PPP model. Overall, however, the quality of ecosystem enablement at these parks is not 
on par with global best practice.BOX 5.3
VIRTUAL TESTING FOR AURUS
The Kortezh project implemented by the Central 
Scientific Research Automobile and Automotive Engine 
Institute (NAMI) focused on building a Russian-made 
official state car (a modular platform-based limousine, 
sedan, SUV, and MPV) for top government officials. In 
2016, after a crash test at an independent test facility 
in Berlin, the new Aurus sedan received a maximum 
five-star European New Car Assessment Program 
(Euro NCAP) safety rating. This ranking validated the 
Russian-developed technology of virtual testing, virtual 
labs and virtual testing environments. The technology 
was developed by the specialists of the Computer 
Engineering Center at the Peter the Great St. Petersburg 
Polytechnic University and the CompMechLab® group 
of companies. The new model, Aurus, was officially 
launched at the Presidential Inauguration ceremony in 
May 2018.
Several research centers have started to work closely 
with leading Russian enterprises in developing smart 
manufacturing products and solutions in Russia. These 
efforts are strongly supported by the government.BOX 5.4
FACTORIES OF FUTURE
The Factories of the Future project is a high-
level government initiative aiming to enhance the 
competitiveness of the Russian high-tech manufacturing 
sector by addressing key industry challenges that 
companies are unable to solve on their own. Participants 
are Russia’s leading enterprises, including the NAMI, 
Sollers, Volgabus, KAMAZ, UEC-Saturn, UEC-Klimov, 
Sredne-Nevsky Shipyard, United Aircraft Corporation/
Sukhoi Civil Aircraft/Irkut Corporation, Russian 
Helicopters/Kamov/Mil Moscow Helicopter Plant, 
NPO OKB Simonov, Kazan Motor-Building Production 
Association, Kazan Helicopter Plant, ROSATOM/
TVEL, and so on. A new NTI Center for Advanced 
Manufacturing Technologies has been established in 
2018 at the Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic 
University, and the eligibility of those technologies to 
receive government support was confirmed.

CompMechLab GROUP OF COMPANIES
Russia’s CompMechLab group of companies has 
developed a unique digital platform CML-Bench 
for the development of digital twins, which won the 
Russian National Industrial Award, INDUSTRIA, in 2017. 
It is a cross-sectoral multidisciplinary platform that 
enables virtual development and testing of globally 
competitive products. The platform already operates 
in automotive, aerospace, helicopter engineering, 
engine building, shipbuilding, machinery industry, oil 
and gas engineering, nuclear energy, and other sectors, 
enabling engineers, suppliers, and customers to work in 
a distributed collaborative environment across different 
companies, countries, and time zones.BOX 5.6
DIGITAL SHIPYARD TO BE BUILT 
IN ST. PETERSBURG
St. Petersburg is among Russia’s digital transformation 
leaders, positioning itself as Russia’s “virtual design 
bureau” for the automotive, aircraft and shipbuilding, 
as well as defense industries. With support from the 
TechNet NTI, and as part of the Factory of the Future 
project, the Middle Nevsky Shipyard is planning to create 
a digital shipyard in the next three years. This will allow 
the company to increase productivity and shorten the 
development time of new products by utilizing advanced 
building technologies such as laser cutting and welding. 
Machines and machine tools will be linked to a single 
information management system to ensure accuracy, 
precision, and efficiency throughout the production 
cycle. Product testing will be done virtually. The goal is to 
double the plant’s production capacity, increase export 
volumes, and reduce the time and costs of production 
and maintenance. The project will be initiated in 2018 
and completed by the end of 2020.

Completing the ecosystem for digital industry are a number of industry and technology 
associations, funds, and organizations, including the Industrial Development Fund (with 
a focus on dual-purpose technologies), the Russian Association of Artificial Intelligence 
(RAAI), the Russian Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Association (RABIK), the Russian 
Association of Robotics (RAR), the Internet of Things Association109 (IOTAS), the Russian 
Association of Industrial Internet (RAII), the SME corporation, the Internet Initiatives 
Development Fund (IIDF), Russian Venture Company (RVC), and the Innovation Promotion 
Fund.
While there is a wide range of institutions, policies, and strategies that affect the 
transformation of industry, they lack alignment and cohesion. This leads to the duplication 
of efforts among ad hoc initiatives, incurs higher coordination and transaction costs, 
and increases the likelihood that critical industrywide enabling investments are being 
overlooked.
Thus, a comprehensive digital industry strategy is required to bring an overarching vision to 
the future of digital industry development in Russia, complete with a clear strategy, a set of 
goals and an implementation roadmap. Potential elements of this strategy can be found in 
existing cross-agency or public-private initiatives, such as TechNet NTI, 4.0 RU, and others.
5.1.3 POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
If Russia is to become a digital industry leader while ensuring that the existing industrial 
base remains competitive, all stakeholders including the government, private sector, 
academia, and research institutions will have to work in close coordination.
Lessons from the global context increasingly indicate that developing a coherent and 
comprehensive digital industry strategy is an essential starting point, but a strategy alone 
will not be sufficient. Digital transformation will bring rapid changes, many of which are 
109 IOTAS; the official name is the Association of IoT Market Participants.BOX 5.7
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE 
MANAGEMENT OF ENERGY NETWORKS 
IN THE KALININGRAD OBLAST
By 2021, the entire power system of the Kaliningrad 
Oblast will be controlled by the automated system 
of operational and technological control “Olympus.” 
The “Digital Distribution Zone” project was already 
implemented in two districts of the Kaliningrad Oblast 
resulting in a fivefold decrease in the average time for 
accident resolution and a twofold decrease in power 
losses. Elements of AI have been introduced to promote 
automated responses to emergency situations including 
the establishment of reserve lines in cases of power 
outage. The automated emergency system kicks in 
within 27 seconds. Under the previous, manual system, 
workers spent approximately three hours on each case. 
The impact is a reduction in operating costs by more 
than 24 percent. It is expected that this system will be 
rolled out throughout the Kaliningrad grid by 2020.BOX 5.8

difficult or impossible to predict, and competitiveness will increasingly depend upon 
the capability of governments, firms, and research institutions to quickly respond and 
adapt to the changing environment. In Russia, industrial competitiveness is hampered 
by a high degree of market consolidation and domination by SoEs, and thus, a top-down 
government-driven digital transformation approach in line with the Chinese model may 
be required to accelerate the transformation process and attempt to catch up with global 
leaders. Without strong top-down leadership, market forces hampered by continuing 
capital outflows and declining local competition are unlikely to force traditional industry to 
make the required significant investments into digital technologies and business process 
transformation. A top-down approach should be amplified by a dynamic horizontal strategy 
built upon platforms of coordination among key stakeholders.
It is also important to perform the following:
 ●Develop a comprehensive digital industry strategy that addresses both industrywide 
digital enablers and sector-specific issues, consistent with international best practice 
and looking both at defending the strategic positioning of Russia’s industry and the 
opportunity to develop high-growth areas. The strategy would benefit from a high-profile 
national initiative, similar to “Made in China 2025” and “Industry 4.0,” that is based on 
a sound analysis of Russia’s comparative and competitive advantages; brings together 
public, private, and research actors; includes specific objectives and target sectors; 
is not limited to large enterprises but fosters a fertile environment for growth among 
SMEs; is backed by a coherent policy coordinated across regions; and is resourced 
adequately. This strategy needs to include concrete metrics against which progress 
can be continuously assessed. Key industrywide enablers that should be the focus of 
the strategy include boosting R&D and innovation, industrial standards alignment, and 
digital skills development.
 ●Strengthen links in the digital industry ecosystem to enable cooperation between the 
private sector (including large companies and SoEs, SMEs, and start-ups), government 
organizations, and academic institutions and research centers to accelerate the pace 
of digital industry transformation. Build partnerships or create consortia to jointly 
develop standards and solutions, drive legislation for emerging technologies, share 
infrastructure, execute large projects, implement training programs, and invest in 
technology start-ups.
 ●Encourage the establishment of strong links between the traditional industry sector 
and the dynamic Russian ICT sector by encouraging traditional industrial SoEs to drive 
demand for locally provided ICT solutions and thus boost both the digital transformation 
of traditional industries and ICT sector growth.
 ●Leverage innovation and encourage spillovers from advanced dual use sectors  such 
as defense, aircraft and shipbuilding, space, and nuclear industry. Experience and know-
how gained in these sectors can accelerate industry transformation and lead to the 
development of new products and services.
 ●Support education initiatives to build digital industry skills:
— Create mechanisms to counteract brain drain and attract leading Russian and foreign 
specialists back to Russia.
— Strengthen the competencies of digital technology specialists through ongoing local 
and international training programs.
— Work with local universities and training institutes to help them understand specific 
industry requirements.
 ●Promote a culture of open innovation and risk taking and highlight successes in digital 
industry transformation.
 ●Create demand for innovation. Encourage digital industry innovation and start-ups, 
including through the creation of corporate venture funds, business incubators, and digital 
factories, as well as technological contests.73 COMPETING IN THE DIGITAL AGE: RUSSIA DIGITAL ECONOMY REPORT
At the sector level:
 ●Assess potential digital industry impact on economic growth, jobs, and service delivery.
 ●For at-risk sectors110 (such as mining and processing), identify leapfrogging opportunities 
through the introduction of digital technologies.
 ●For emerging technology opportunities, prioritize sectors for new technologies 
application and develop short-, mid-, and long-term strategies and implementation-
oriented product-focused consortia.
5.2 Global Best Practice for Enabling the 
Digital Transformation of Russian Agriculture
In recent years, Russian agriculture has experienced significant growth and become a 
leader of Russian exports and a champion in import substitution, as some large Russian 
agribusinesses have been driving the adoption of cutting-edge digital technologies in 
farming practices. Policy makers should now focus on encouraging large late adopters as 
well as boosting the agriculture ecosystem to empower small and medium farms to take 
advantage of digital technologies to transform their business and service models.
5.2.1 GLOBAL TRENDS IN DIGITAL AGRICULTURE
As in all sectors of economic activity, in agriculture, digital technologies are transforming 
farming and agribusiness across the globe, not only for large commercial players and small 
farms in the world’s wealthier countries but increasingly in the middle-income and emerging 
markets as well.
LEVERAGING THE EXPLOSION OF DIGITAL INFORMATION
The adoption of digital technologies has led to an explosion of information and knowledge 
available to all players in the agriculture ecosystem.
One emerging source of information is remote sensing. Satellites are collecting field-level 
information about crop cover, soil, and weather conditions. Drones are capturing detailed 
information at the field level, monitoring crop diseases, soil moisture, property boundaries, 
and so on. This information is then analyzed and shared among farmers, public agencies, 
and industry observers alike.
Satellites also help control farm machinery and customize the application of 
inputs in the fields. Hyper-local weather information drives field-level activity 
and marketing decisions. Digital platforms allow farmers to summon farm 
equipment for hire and find buyers and sellers for their products. Pests and 
diseases can be identified remotely (using digital imaging) and responses can 
be mobilized rapidly. Soil moisture monitors trigger irrigation and enable new 
customized approaches to water management. The ever-expanding availability 
of digital tools helps small and remote farms to link with partners and buyers, 
carve out niche markets, and explore new business models.
Digital solutions such as integrated agricultural production control systems, wireless 
monitoring and diagnostics, integrated sounding technologies, climate risk management, 
and so on help in soil and ground water restoration and pest management and enable 
110 Following Digital McKinsey 2017, p. 41–42.Satellites are making field-
level information available 
to farmers, agribusiness, 
and governmentGLOBAL BEST PRACTICE FOR ACCELERATING BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION IN RUSSIA  74
remote integrated monitoring of compliance with the certification requirements, for 
example, in organic agriculture.
Digital platforms empower farmers by expanding access to relevant practical information 
such as farm product prices and availability, local weather forecasts, best farming and 
animal breeding practices, seed varieties, pest and disease control, and so on (for example, 
Farmer Business Network in the United States, WeFarm and Twiga Food in Kenya, and 
eKutir Global in India).
The IoT enables “Precision Crop Management,” for example, monitoring wheat crop 
nutrition status in real time. Then, data analysis, digital task management, and automation 
enable precise water and nitrogen application. IoT is also used on-farm to establish real-
time communication between farm machines.
IoT technologies also enable on-the-ground sensors to continuously relay 
information to farmers about water usage, soil moisture, field (or greenhouse) 
temperature, and other important production variables. This allows rapid 
response to current conditions by adjusting irrigation pumping, for example, or 
turning on or off water and heaters in greenhouses.
Strategically placed weather ground stations relay critical, detailed, and 
location-specific weather information to weather information services. Sensors on farm 
machinery record the location of the machinery as well as operational and performance 
data.
LEVERAGING DIGITAL TOOLS TO SUPPORT “PRECISION AGRICULTURE”
More than ever before, digital tools and services make it possible for knowledge to be 
made available directly (through push or pull services) to farmers and to other stakeholders 
in the agricultural sector. In Russian agriholdings, for example, detailed technical 
instructions are relayed from agriholding headquarters to staff in the fields, instructions can 
be sent directly from satellites to farm workers and farm machinery in real time, as they 
work with crops and livestock in fields and barns—adapting seeding rates, fertilization, feed 
mixes, etc. on the go—in what is called “precision agriculture.”
Farmers can also “pull” information about markets and prices, disease threats and ways to 
address them, weather data, and location-specific forecasts.
Digital soil databases and digital soil mapping manage data on the state of soils and soil 
cover to enable combating desertification, halting and reversing land degradation, and IoT is used on-farm 
to establish real-time 
communication between 
farm machines
BOX 5.9
ENABLING PRECISION AGRICULTURE
An example of a private sector initiative to make detailed and local information available directly to farmers and 
agribusiness is the platform developed by a U.S.-based firm called aWhere. aWhere operates a global-scale agronomic 
modeling environment with immense processing capacity that collects over 7 billion points of data every day to create 
unprecedented visibility and insight across the agricultural earth. aWhere’s hyperlocal information and insight support 
precision agriculture. Using proprietary blending and predictive modeling, aWhere provides field-level observed 
and forecast weather, growth stages, and pest and disease risks. aWhere’s information platform and tools transform 
agricultural decision making by grounding them in data and analytical insight that has never existed before.75 COMPETING IN THE DIGITAL AGE: RUSSIA DIGITAL ECONOMY REPORT
improving agricultural land quality to support sustainable agriculture and enhance food 
security.
On a global level, the International Soil Reference and Information Centre (ISRIC) has 
created the SoilGrids soil information system.111 The system provides public access to global 
soil map, as well as access to the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB). The 
SoilGrids system is constantly updated, which facilitates reliable assessments of the impact 
of climate change and land degradation on food production.112
On a country level, in the United States, for example, collection, storage, management, 
and dissemination of information on the soil cover are the responsibility of the Natural 
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
(USDA). The NRCS has created soil-geographical databases, such as the Soil Survey 
Geographic Database (SSURGO) and the State Soil Geographic Database (STATSGO).
This database was developed mainly for the planning and management of natural 
resources at local and regional levels such as farms and ranches, settlements, and districts.
Another example of soil data use at the state level is the Department of Agriculture of 
Uruguay, which also provides public access to soil information. Soil types are classified 
according to their productivity and measured according to an index called “CONEAT.” 
113 The CONEAT index of a property also correlates with the price of the land and makes 
market transparent: it is easy to compare properties.

GLOBALIZATION OF AGRICULTURE KNOW-HOW THROUGH DIGITAL 
TECHNOLOGIES: INTERNET OF FOOD & FARM 2020
Technology deployment to obtain, extract, and manage 
agriculture information from and to farms is only 
economically viable at a large scale. The Internet of 
Food & Farm 2020 (IoF2020), a mega IoT pilot project 
in agriculture co-funded by the European Commission 
aims to convene key private, public, and not-for-profit 
stakeholders throughout the value chain to validate 
technology choices, for example, timely and precise 
farm data analysis; IoT for productivity enhancement and 
traceability; GPS and censor for livestock movement; and 
machine learning technology for dairy quality assurance.
In addition, IoF2020 seeks to address issues of systems 
interoperability, data security, and localization to 
structure optimal business models and processes and to 
provide agri-tech entrepreneurs with relevant data and 
market entry support.
Along with Wageningen University Research in 
the Netherlands, the 70 partners of IoF2020 from 14 countries focus on five work pillars—(1) project 
management, (2) trial management, (3) IoT integration 
and capabilities, (4) business support, and (5) ecosystem 
development—and on five agriculture value chains: 
arable crops, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and meat. Notably, 
among the 38 private sector partners, 24 are SMEs. The 
project places an emphasis on actively involving end 
users, the farmers, to codesign and to provide feedback 
on user experience.
Launched in the first and second quarters of 2017, 
IoF2020 has developed 19 cases to date with 
various areas of progress. For example, “Within Field 
Management Zoning,” an IoT deployment for potato 
farming, aims to develop detailed soil maps and establish 
automation and machine communication. The pilot 
seeks to reach higher yield and quality with decreased 
production costs through improving farm management, 
serving small size farms of 50 to 200 ha.GLOBAL BEST PRACTICE FOR ACCELERATING BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION IN RUSSIA  76
In Europe, the main source of soil data is the European Soil Database (ECDB). It includes 
the territory of Belarus, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine.114 In addition, soil information 
is included in the Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe (INSPIRE) as one of 
34 themes. INSPIRE is a directive of the EU established in May 2007. It obliges all EU 
members to create an infrastructure of spatial data on the Internet to facilitate the 
standardized exchange of geographical information between countries. Different types 
of spatial data that are provided by different organizations are used simultaneously and 
are combined into layers in different user apps. It is believed that ensuring the wide 
availability of such information will allow many industries and government institutions to 
improve operating efficiency and reduce costs. The project implementation will end in 
2019, with the expected economic effect estimated at more than €1 billion per year. 115
HELPING SMALL FARMS THROUGH DIGITAL PLATFORMS
Digital tools are important not only for helping farmers to harness the power of technical 
knowledge and information. They also allow farmers and other agricultural actors to 
overcome traditional barriers such as isolation and asymmetric information to become much 
more effective participants in both input and output markets. Two important dimensions of 
these phenomena have to do with dramatically improving and expanding links between 
market participants and facilitating reliable and rapid transactions of financial assets even in 
remote and cashless locations.
LINKING MARKET PARTICIPANTS THROUGH DIGITAL PLATFORMS
Platform economics are transforming agriculture.116 Today, these platforms not only match 
supply and demand at digital marketplaces but also encourage collaboration, services 
exchanges, and create links to other economic sectors such as tourism, hospitality, and 
catering, to name a few. Digital technology allows these platforms to target the global market 
while still being rooted in the local (national) economy. From tractors to organic honey, the 
economics of platforms are emerging as an accelerator that is also simplifying trade in the 
fields of agriculture and food. But it also acts as a disruptor: farmers evolve into providers of 
services (from agricultural work to the accommodation of tourists).
Agricultural produce and food, as well as equipment and supplies, are available on many 
platforms. In France, Le Bon Coin sells second-hand equipment. In some U.S. cities, Amazon 
Fresh allows customers to do grocery shopping online. Airbnb offers farm holidays, while 
crowdfunding platforms aim to provide funding for agricultural projects. But there are also 
specific platforms for agriculture and food. They can be divided into five major categories.
NEW MARKETPLACES
Platforms are coming into being as “marketplaces,” or virtual meeting places, that match 
the supply and demand of goods and services by bringing together users and professional 
suppliers.
Initially, these marketplaces specialized in agricultural equipment and inputs. 
The Agriconomie platform, for instance, is a meeting place for distributors (retailers and 
wholesalers) and farmers in the market for inputs (seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides), spare 
parts, or small farming equipment. The “open” interface allows any company acting in a 
professional capacity to sell products on the website.
114 Stolbovoi et al. 2001.
115 INSPIRE Framework Definition Support Working Group 2003.
116 The discussion of platforms is based on Abelow, Abidi-Barthe, and Abiteboul 2016.77 COMPETING IN THE DIGITAL AGE: RUSSIA DIGITAL ECONOMY REPORT
A global leader in agricultural equipment, Agriaffaires is an open platform that was established 
in 2000 and specializes in the wholesale distribution of agricultural equipment (cars, trucks, 
tractors, combine harvesters, and so on). Both new and used products are offered for sale 
or lease by dealers/distributors, traders, manufacturers, and farmers—in over 25 countries, 
including the United States, Germany, and Great Britain.
These marketplaces do not only involve intermediate consumption, but also agricultural 
production, thus replacing wholesale markets. The usefulness of these platforms is not limited 
to bringing together buyers and sellers. They also offer management services for contracts 
and invoices, to simplify administrative procedures. Furthermore, an independent lab analyzes 
and controls the products for sale.
Trade and sharing on collaborative sites, whether commercial or not, form a second category 
of platforms, which puts the emphasis on sharing and exchange and in which both users and 
providers are professionals.
WeFarmUp, a platform for the “sharing of equipment” among farmers, is the latest example in 
the world of agriculture to help solve two major problems facing farmers: massive debt and 
irregular income. Farmers rent out some of their equipment via the site, to obtain a source 
of income. Other farmers lease the equipment, to meet a specific need or to test a machine 
before purchasing it.
In the United States, MachineryLink solutions by Farmlink offers a similar platform. It works on 
the same principle, but on MachineryLink solutions, farmers renting out equipment can also 
offer their services.
Collaborative platforms promoting local production and combatting waste have also emerged 
in the food industry. In compliance with the public procurement code, the French platform 
Agrilocal tries to bring together local suppliers and “public buyers that need mass catering 
services” (secondary schools, retirement homes, hospitals, and so on). A buyer starts by 
expressing their needs. The information is then transmitted via the platform to local suppliers 
who may or may not respond. The buyer then chooses among the different propositions and 
places the order. The Loc’Halles Burgundy platform has a similar goal.
The Californian Copia platform aims, in turn, to connect companies that have a food surplus, 
such as restaurants, with people in need, to fight against food waste and assist the needy. 
The companies order a vehicle that collects leftover food and brings it to a food bank or a 
homeless shelter. The Food Neighbourly platform in Britain and Foodsharing in Germany work 
according to the same principle.
There is also another type of collaborative platform that brings together users who are private 
individuals and professional suppliers. The best-known example in France is La Ruche qui dit 
oui. Created in 2011, this platform links producers and consumers for selling/buying foodstuffs 
(fruits, vegetables, bread, cheese, meat, and so on) produced within 150 miles of the point of 
distribution. As of today, it comprises some 4,000 suppliers and over 100,000 regular users. 
The open platform allows any producer to sign up as long as the producer meets a number 
of agricultural production standards (environmentally responsible agriculture versus industrial 
agriculture). Its specificity consists, on the one hand, in the “hive”—a point of distribution close 
to consumers’ homes, where they can pick up their orders and even meet producers—and, 
on the other, in the “hive manager,” whether a private individual, an association, or a business. 
Producers determine the selling price of their products themselves and pay a commission on 
sales as compensation for the platform and the hive manager. Other French platforms that 
follow the same model include Locavor, Marchands de 4 saisons, and Label Fourmi.
Some such platforms allow customers to order food directly from producers and retrieve it 
in a locker inside a store (Au bout du champ) or to contact farmers directly to purchase their 
products. Others even organize visits, meals, and leisure activities on the farms themselves 
(Bienvenue à la ferme).GLOBAL BEST PRACTICE FOR ACCELERATING BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION IN RUSSIA  78
Crowdfunding platforms are also interested in the agricultural sector and the food industry. 
In this case, providers are private individuals, consumers, or professionals.
French start-up MiiMOSA provides a link between “project leaders” and “contributors” 
who are private individuals. The former present their project to the site and specify the 
amount of funding they need to carry it out. The latter fund the projects through donations 
in accordance with their means and wishes. They do, however, receive a sort of in-kind 
compensation (product, meal, or weekend). The platform is financed in the form of a 
commission of on the required amount.
The Blue Bees platform presents several distinctive features as compared to MiiMOSA. 
It finances environmentally friendly projects in the agro-food industry (especially organic 
farming projects), including abroad. It also provides funding in the form of loans. Finally, it 
involves “local actors” (design office, associations, NGOs, fair trade companies, and so on) 
who “identify and structure projects and support their implementation.”
On P2P platforms private individuals come into play. This type of platform only involves 
private individuals, who, according to a P2P logic, figure as both suppliers and users. 
These exchanges, whether commercial or not, concern mainly catering and gastronomy 
and involve private individuals eating together or sharing prepared meals or even food 
products.
VizEat is a collaborative platform for sharing meals (also known as food surfing) . It aims at 
connecting tourists and hosts who wish to have them over for a meal at their homes. The 
site takes a commission on the price set for the user. VizEat is present in over 60 countries. 
Other platforms based on the same principle include VoulezVousDiner and BonAppetour in 
France, as well as Feastly and Bookalokal internationally.
Sharing also extends to food products via food barter platforms for exchanging fruits, 
vegetables, fish, meat, eggs, mushrooms, seeds, plants, honey, pasta, and spices. There are 
many examples in North America, such as LA Food Swap in Los Angeles and Chicago Food 
Swap in Chicago. As part of the LA Food Swap, the community organizes various “events,” 
during which its members, who previously registered on the platform, barter homemade or 
homegrown products.
Platforms are gaining ground in the emerging markets as well. For example, in Nigeria, 
Kenya, and South Asia, HelloTractor brings tractor services through mobile platform to 
farms upon request. A similar model to Uber, HelloTractor leverages the notion of the 
sharing economy to improve farm productivity through tractor rental. Instead of purchasing 
the machinery at a huge amount of up-front investment, the service creates a space for 
tractor owners to earn additional income when their fleet is idle and for renters to free up 
part of the financial resources through tractor service purchase on demand. HelloTractor 
equips compact tractors with GPS monitoring devices to keep track of the fleet’s location 
and workload, giving insights into the tractor’s status. With the wealth of data gathered 
through the devices, HelloTractor envisages capitalizing on data analysis possibilities to 
provide additional services in the future.
DIGITAL TOOLS ALSO FACILITATE ACCESS TO MARKET AND FINANCE
In emerging markets, specifically, digital technology is used to address issues stemming 
from the lack of market information, market information asymmetry, impediments to business 
development and access to finance due to distance, crop insurance, and the challenges of 
connectivity to various existing platforms.
For small farms, the barrier to accessing timely and appropriate financing is often a deal 
breaker or maker in operation planning and business investment. To address this issue by 
leveraging digital technology, in Kenya, for example, financial tech start-up Umati Capital 79 COMPETING IN THE DIGITAL AGE: RUSSIA DIGITAL ECONOMY REPORT
provides small agribusiness suppliers to 80 percent the value of its receivable amount in 
cash on behalf of the buyers. This financing method, also known as factoring and invoice 
discounting, can now be extended to small size agribusiness players by using digital tools for 
the evaluation of debtor credit worthiness. The digital solution also extends to the payment 
option. By partnering with Citi Bank, Umati Capital processes payments online, providing 
clients with quick access to funds within 24 hours upon receipt of relevant documents.
In Turkey, a FinTech company called Tarfin provides point-of-sale financing to small farms 
by working with input suppliers through an online platform and is developing an algorithm to 
structure a credit assessment tool for farmers without prior lending experience.
Designed specifically for the African market and supported by Vodacom’s Mezzanine 
software, Safaricom rolled out “Connected Farmer Solutions,” a mobile-based platform for 
agribusiness to process payment transactions with small farmers and “DigiFarm,” for small 
farmers to receive extension services, input supplies, and financing through mobile devices.
In insurance, U.S. Climate Corporation/Monsanto, for example, uses data analytics, machine 
learning, and climate and agronomic models to produce weather simulations, measure 
potential loss, and price their products. After adjusting for climate change, Climate Corp 
names a price and creates customizable weather policy for each client. Policyholders get their 
checks automatically for the specific weather events that will cause them financial loss.
BLOCKCHAIN
Blockchain can benefit the global food system by improving the process in which food 
is produced, delivered, and sold117 by increasing the transparency of the food supply and 
facilitating mobile payments, credits, and financing. The improved traceability and the 
immutability of data can also help verify the accuracy of food production, certification, and 
food processing as well as reduce food loss and food waste. Moreover, smart contracts 
enable involved parties to transact without intermediaries, eventually lowering the final price 
of the product for the end consumers.
To date, the majority of the blockchain applications in agriculture is in the 
concept stage or early pilot phase with the private sector as the main driver of 
adoption.118 Most projects are housed in the United States, Europe, or Australia; 
around 30 percent of the pilots are in Sub-Saharan Africa.119
In Australia, AgriDigital recently piloted the blockchain technology in facilitating 
the national grain supply chain transparency.120 On the blockchain system, digital title is 
created and the grower holds the title until payment is received from the buyer, after which 
the title is transferred, with quality and quantity of the commodity recorded in the system. 
In between, the system also handles auto-payment through cryptocurrency in parallel with 
standard banking methods. The exchange of digital currency and title can be processed at 
the rate of four transactions per second.121 The platform also tracks physical inventory routes, 
creating identification of authenticity of products through the various data points captured 
along the way.122
In 2017, IBM piloted blockchain applications for the food industry and agribusiness financing 
in the United States and Africa, respectively. Working with major retail stores such as Walmart, 
Nestlé, and Costco, the IBM blockchain system aims to improve food products traceability to 
improve food safety.

In 2018, IBM Africa in Kenya partnered with a local agriculture logistics start-up Twiga Food 
to extend financing for the small agribusinesses it serves. Twiga Food helps smallholder 
farmers deliver their product to the kiosks across the country. By using blockchain, farmers 
are able to receive microfinance loans for working capital use, owing to the transaction data 
stored on the mobile money platform M-Pesa that is the main financing and transaction 
channel for majority of the population in Kenya. The blockchain platform assesses business 
creditworthiness through an AI algorithm to make lending decisions. Blockchain technology 
helps increase the transparency of lending processes and decrease fraud.
MANAGING DIGITAL INFORMATION WITHIN THE AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEM
Digital tools are transforming the way that knowledge and information about agriculture 
is managed at every level. As discussed earlier, at the level of farms and agribusinesses, 
effective data analysis is key to increases in productivity and profitability.
At the level of ministries and public agencies, digital tools enable better communication and 
coordination, help formulate policies, adapt regulation, and collect feedback, thus improving 
the efficiency of agriculture public policy tools.
The leading international organizations and national governments are paying increasing 
attention to smart agriculture—the use of automated decision-making systems, integrated 
automation and production robotics, as well as technologies for the design of agriculture 
ecosystems.
As in other sectors, data analysis and AI enable evidence-based decision making, 
customization and tailoring, transparency, and measurement of public programs in this sector.
One of the most basic agricultural information functions of the public sector is in the area of 
agricultural statistics. Historically, public agricultural statistics systems in many countries have 
often been unreliable and difficult to use. A digital national agricultural statistics system (linked 
to the national statistics authority) can overcome earlier obstacles to ensure easy collection, 
storage, access, and analysis of agricultural data.
ROLE OF THE AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEM IN DRIVING DIGITAL ADOPTION
For the adoption of technologies such as hyper-spectral imaging, the up-front investment 
required often proves prohibitive to small and even medium farms. Thus, a coordinated 
ecosystem approach is often required to devise the right mechanism to enable small 
players to benefit. Some private companies are working with the public sector to explore 
the option of flipping technology ownership: instead of farms owning the technology, the 
public sector can bear the up-front cost of installment, leveraging the data captured for 
program design, tailored extension, and advisory services delivery. The key is to make data 
available to relevant stakeholders beyond the financial and technical constraints that often 
hinder small farms’ access to necessary information.
5.2.2 DIGITAL AGRICULTURE IN RUSSIA
The digital transformation of Agriculture has been highlighted as a top priority for export 
growth by the May 2018 Presidential Decree. In fact, digital technologies are already 
beginning to transform Russian agribusiness where some large agriholding companies 
operate at the cutting edge of the application of digital technologies. These industrial 
farms, with large land and livestock holdings, possess the financial resources and the 
management know-how to own and leverage the most advanced technology. Some have 
sophisticated IT staff to develop and manage the digital transformation of farm operations.81 COMPETING IN THE DIGITAL AGE: RUSSIA DIGITAL ECONOMY REPORT
At some large farms in Russia today, satellites control farm machinery and customize the 
application of inputs to specific areas in farmers’ fields. Hyper-local weather information 
drives field-level activity and marketing decisions. Platforms allow farmers to plan and 
monitor the use of farm equipment and to find buyers and sellers for the products they 
use and produce. Pests and diseases can be identified remotely (using digital imaging 
from drones and satellites) and responses can be mobilized rapidly. Soil monitors measure 
soil moisture to trigger irrigation and enable new customized approaches to water 
management. Mobile phones send actionable signals to farm equipment. Sophisticated 
management applications help do farm planning. Production and harvest monitoring tools 
make it possible to control the quality of the farm products.
These developments have had a positive impact on the performance of the agriculture 
sector, leading to a boost in domestic consumption, ensuring import substitution, as well as 
increasing exports (Figure 5.6).
THE EMERGENCE OF PLATFORMS IN RUSSIAN AGRICULTURE
A cloud-based farm data management platform, ExactFarming, collects and analyzes 
satellite farm operation data including pesticide usage, farm vehicle operation, and 
vegetation status to inform farm decision making. The platform also tailors weather and soil 
data and enables the monitoring of farm vehicle location, tasks, and performance, such as 
completion rate and speed, through the Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS)/
GPS.
Data analysis then enables agro-dealers to bridge gaps throughout the supply chains 
and financial institutions as well as agribusiness companies to extend credit to small and 
medium farms.FIGURE 5.6  Agriculture Exports in Russia, 2004–2017

Among the 5,000 accounts on the platform, the majority of the farmlands under 
management are above 1,000 ha, with around 30 percent of accounts managing land 
below 1,000 ha.
USE OF DRONES IS ON THE RISE
Within the Russian agri-tech spectrum, the development of unmanned aerial vehicles 
(UAVs), commonly known as drones, for crop and soil quality monitoring is comparatively 
mature. Several products and services have undergone pilots and are moving on to 
mass commercialization. AgroDronGroup and GeoScan employ drones equipped with 
cameras to conduct aerial surveys. These surveys are capable of obtaining, among others, 
orthophotos, data for vegetative index mapping (NDVI), snapshots of crop conditions 
and levels of germination, and information about water erosion. As opposed to standard 
satellite images of 15–30 meters per pixel resolution, GeoScan UAV provides images of 
5 centimeters resolution, covering farm sizes from 30,000 ha to 100,000 ha. Information 
resulting from image analysis helps farms with soil cultivation, disease monitoring, yield 
control, and flood modeling.
COLLECTING SOIL INFORMATION
The National Soil Database is in the experimental stage of development. It is compatible 
with similar databases of the EU, the United States, the Food and Agriculture Organization 
of the United Nations, and WRB. Work is under way to extend the functionality of the 
database for a wide range of practical applications. An internationally recognized standard 
GeoRSS was used in a pilot project in the Rostov region to enable data exchange between 
regional databases and the National Soil Database. Russian soil data are also available in 
the Global Soil Organic Carbon Map (GSOC17), which was created using technologies of 
data exchange between regional data collection centers.
Interestingly, there also exists a series of large – and medium-scale national soil maps of 
Russia as well as the rest of the world that remain from a large mapping effort undertaken 
in Soviet times. There is currently an initiative under way to update and digitize these maps 
by using satellite data and digital soil mapping technologies and taking into account more 
recent attempts to create a unified digital soils database at the country level.123 The Russian 
Ministry of Agriculture relies on a digital database created from a 1987 soil map of Russia124 
and has launched its own data collection initiative.125

INTERNET OF THINGS IN THE FOREST INDUSTRY
Russian timber reserves are estimated at 83 billion cubic meters and are among the world’s largest. IT Metsa Group 
Russia has introduced the virtual forest concept by connecting forest resources to IoT. Monitoring, data collection, and 
ground assessment are done with the help of drones and using sensors installed on special harvest cars. One car can 
replace an entire logging team, and all its actions are recorded by the onboard computer, including the breed and the 
characteristics of the timber. Log trucks are also equipped with GPS sensors, allowing the company to control loading, 
unloading, and delivery.

Once it is completed, this initiative will enable the creation of many products and 
agribusiness applications in line with global best practices in “smart agriculture,” thus, 
for example, enabling the sustainable use of soils, creating a cadaster of land plots, and 
providing a platform for launching global projects in food security and the protection of the 
environment, 126 as well as equipping small farmers with modern tools to help them find a 
competitive niche for their products in the markets.
Data interoperability standards are key to allowing the use of and contribution to the 
database by all the members of the agriculture ecosystem, including government agencies, 
private sector organizations, related and supporting industry firms, and the farming 
communities.
ROBOTIC SOIL TESTING AND MAPPING
To complement the current soil test methods, RoboProb designed a robotic platform for 
automated soil sampling to minimize human error and to increase efficiency. The platform 
is a self-propelled complex that can work as a stand-alone device or as a trailing unit on 
any transport vehicle. The automation service of RoboProb soil sampling, labeling, and 
packaging is able to reduce farm labor from a team of five to a one-man team that can carry 
out 36 samples in one go. The data extracted from the farm are compiled into an electronic 
soil map, detailing the fertilizer application of each plot.
BLOCKCHAIN IN AGRICULTURAL VALUE CHAINS
There are several blockchain pilots in Russian agribusiness today (TakeWIng, Agrivita Farm, 
LavkaLavka, and others). These include applications to improve meat products traceability, 
streamline payments, and other financial transactions. A company in Tatarstan, for example, 
is experimenting with cryptocurrencies to track meat bull health and trace meat throughout 
the supply chain.127 In central Russia farms are beginning to leverage blockchain for smart 
contracts.
To encourage the adoption of blockchain beyond the initial pilots, the government should 
work with the private sector to assess the advantages and risks of this technology and 
to enhance regulation accordingly, as well as to launch initiatives to help the public 
understand the value the technology can deliver.
THE DIGITAL AGRICULTURE PROJECT
In spite of some success in the digital transformation of agriculture, the overall level of 
digital adoption in agriculture is quite low. Many Russian farms still lack the connectivity 
and skill sets needed to take advantage of such technologies. Today 63 percent of large 
agribusinesses, 42 percent of small farms, and 16 percent of individual farms are connected 
to the Internet.128 There is a broad lack of general knowledge and understanding of new 
technologies and their potential application in the sector. Due to the insufficient level of 
digital adoption in Russian agriculture, in 2018, work has begun on the development of the 
Digital Agriculture Project. Once finalized, the project will be submitted for approval to the 
Russian government by the end of 2018.
Project goals are ambitious and include increasing agriculture exports growth from 
US$20 billion in 2018 to US$45 billion by 2025, achieving a RUB 8.9 trillion contribution 
to the GDP, as well as increases in efficiency and productivity in the sector, decreases in 
126 Alyablina et al. 2010.

production costs, creation of new technology-intensive products and services, and a rise in 
the overall standard of living in the rural areas.
The project rightly aims to mobilize all the key players of the digital agriculture ecosystem 
with the goal to accelerate digital adoption in the sector by providing fixed and mobile 
broadband connectivity, enhancing data collection, storage, management, and analysis, 
implementing digital platforms in the sector, launching innovative financing mechanisms, 
and taking advantage of the latest in AI and IoT technologies.
Participants in the digital agriculture ecosystem mobilized by this project include key 
government and private sector contributors as well as NGOs and the academic and 
scientific communities. Specifically, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Timiriazev Agrarian 
University, the HSE, Sberbank (the largest Russian public bank and a leader in digital 
transformation), Skolkovo Foundation, Rostech (a leading Russian technology company), 
Mobile Telesystems, agricultural equipment producers such as Rosselmash, agriculture 
production unions, IoT and Internet associations, as well as regional government 
administrations and ministries, such as the Tambov, Kaliningrad, Moscow, Stavropol, and 
Belgorod regions as well as the Republic of Tatarstan.
A Digital Agriculture Competencies Center was established in June 2018. It is expected 
that the project will set the stage for Russia’s Smart Agriculture Strategy, contribute to the 
FoodNet initiative, and be integrated into the Russia Digital Economy Program by the end 
of 2018.
5.2.3. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
Overall, while large agribusiness companies have made some progress in leveraging 
the power of new digital technologies, small and medium farms in Russia are falling 
behind.129 Accelerated digital adoption will help large agribusinesses further improve 
their performance and enable small and medium farms to expand production and build 
competitiveness in niche and premium markets underserved by large agribusiness 
companies.
The public sector should actively facilitate the engagement of small farmers with digital 
tools that will improve productivity and incomes on their farms.
The adoption of a single digital agriculture/smart agriculture strategy as part of the Russia 
Digital Economy Program will certainly help accelerate the digital transformation of this key 
sector.
Specifically, it is necessary to:
 ●Develop and strengthen cooperation in the digital agriculture ecosystem that links key 
stakeholders within the sector and at the cross-sectoral level. These include farmers, 
industry and services suppliers, telecom and digital solutions providers, transport and 
logistics providers, FinTech solution providers, tourism operators, and others;
 ●Improve the data infrastructure: a system of policy measures, institutional arrangements, 
technologies, data interoperability standards, and qualified staff to enable effective data 
collection, storage, management, and analysis;
 ●Launch open government-driven digital platforms for farms and agriculture communities 
to help them access relevant information, assets, and services and reach out to new 
markets and clients. Enable seamless mobile access to user-friendly applications;
 ●Develop financing mechanisms to bring digital transformation to small farms;
129 Hakobyan et al. 2017.85 COMPETING IN THE DIGITAL AGE: RUSSIA DIGITAL ECONOMY REPORT
 ●Develop greater capacity in the public sector at each level of government to use digital 
tools to manage and curate agricultural information;
 ●Launch education and training initiatives to help farmers understand and use digital 
tools effectively and stimulate broad testing and uptake of digital tools;
 ●Encourage entrepreneurship and attract investment into agri-tech start-ups to pilot and 
implement cutting-edge technologies in agriculture; and
 ●Promote Russia’s participation in global digital initiatives in agriculture.
5.3 Global Best Practice for Advancing 
Services Transformation: The Case 
of Digital Finance in Russia
The Russian market for financial technologies has been experiencing rapid growth driven 
by the adoption of online payments and remittances characteristic of emerging economies, 
on the one hand, and the adoption of FinTech solutions for more mature markets such as 
insurance, lending, and investment management, on the other hand. The sector has also 
been an early adopter of cutting-edge technologies such as biometrics and blockchain 
and has been driving the adoption of a national digital ID system. Policy makers should 
further encourage innovation in this sector by adopting appropriate regulation and fostering 
partnerships in the digital finance ecosystem, including the public sector, regulatory 
agencies, FinTech companies, banks, and other financial organizations.
5.3.1 FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY IN GLOBAL CONTEXT
The financial sector is experiencing a dramatic shift caused by the rapid advancement 
of new financial technologies, widely referred to as “FinTech.” The financial sector has 
historically been an early adopter and an extensive user of new technologies. Yet, the focus 
to date has been on computerization, enhancing efficiencies of existing processes and 
introducing additional transactional channels. Recent developments in FinTech represent 
a fundamental transformation across the entire financial service industry. New players 
and incumbents are introducing business models that depart radically from a “business as 
usual” approach.
The terms digital finance and FinTech have generally been used synonymously, though 
there are subtle differences. Digital finance describes the broader trend of digitization in 
financial services and the overall financial sector component of a digital economy.130 In its 
2017 report on FinTech, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) put forward a working definition 
of FinTech as “technologically enabled financial innovation that could result in new 
business models, applications, processes, or products with an associated material effect 
on financial markets and institutions and the provision of financial services.” In this chapter, 
we use digital finance and FinTech interchangeably and have adopted the FSB definition of 
FinTech.
FinTech’s disruptive potential is attracting investment banks and other financial service 
providers, VC firms, and other investors. Private investment in FinTech ventures grew from 
US$1.8 billion in 2010 to US$19 billion in 2016, according to a recent report by Citigroup.131 
As Figure 5.7 shows, recent investments center on the most profitable areas of global 
banking.132
130 World Bank 2016.
131 Citi GPS 2016.
132 Ibid.GLOBAL BEST PRACTICE FOR ACCELERATING BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION IN RUSSIA  86
Compared to traditional financial services, FinTech solutions are not limited to 
“licensed,” or government-regulated, operators. Many FinTech players are not 
covered directly by the regulated financial system, including, but not limited 
to, mobile operators, FinTech start-ups, and digital companies. These drive 
innovations beyond the limits of traditional financial institutions—however, 
banks and other financial institutions remain key players in the financial 
inclusion landscape, particularly in emerging economies. The disruptive nature 
of new technologies challenges the traditional business models of financial institutions 
and drives them to create new strategies to stay profitable. Accordingly, banks and other 
regulated financial institutions are also rapidly embracing the FinTech developments and 
transforming their products and services.
FinTech takes advantage of existing infrastructure to apply a range of emerging 
technologies to new service creation. At the same time, it can drive the improvement 
of existing financial infrastructure. Interoperability and open APIs of most solutions may 
contribute to the inclusivity of many FinTech solutions. Because of open APIs, it is possible 
to utilize the same technologies globally and enable entrepreneurs to develop, test, and 
refine services for consumers at a very low cost and develop solutions that may promote 
inclusion based on shared technology or platforms.BOX 5.12
INNOVATION IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
Payment services and market infrastructures. E-money 
and mobile money products; DLTs to restructure key 
market infrastructures (for example, payment systems, 
central securities depositories, clearing houses, and 
central counterparties) and cross-border payments.
Crypto-assets and Central Bank-issued digital 
currencies. Crypto-assets as a means of payment; bridge 
currency for cross-border payments; central banks’ pilot 
programs to issue digital fiat currency alongside broader 
use of scriptural ledger and physical notes and coins.
ID, authentication, and know your customer (KYC) 
utilities. Digital interfaces to ID platforms for supporting 
account opening and authentication of transactions, 
leveraging DLTs to establish mechanisms for sharing 
KYC data, and establishing shared KYC repositories.
Alternative data and credit appraisals. Transaction 
data from e-commerce and payment platforms (for 
example, Alibaba and Paypal), mobile phone usage data, 
and social network-related data are all being used as 
alternative sources of information for assessing credit 
worthiness.
Trade finance and SME credit services. Risk 
management and payments are combined in a way 
that embeds and distributes financial services through 
nonbank companies while improving on previous models 
such as letters of credit.New ways for deposits, lending, and capital raising. 
Crowdsourced ideas and fundraising through online 
crowdfunding and P2P lending platforms and using 
Internet-only banks. Initial Coin Offerings for raising 
capital sometimes through community engagement.
Investment management. Automated processing and 
dissemination of investment advice decreasing human 
interventions and reducing costs.
InsurTech. Insurance technologies that leverage new 
developments in big data, industrial sensors, and IoT 
to gather and analyze data to enhance underwriting 
processes, P2P insurance, and leveraging DLTs and 
smart contracts to automate insurance payouts.
Contextual finance. Finance-related services by retailers 
such as Alibaba, transport companies such as Uber, 
agri-tech firms, distributors, and other technology firms 
integrated into financial architecture.
RegTech. Services that leverage technology for 
increased effectiveness and efficiency of regulatory 
and compliance requirements (for example, ‘big data’ 
analytics for anti-money laundering/combatting the 
financing of terrorism analysis, distributed ledgers to 
share statutory returns, smart contracts to enforce 
regulatory requirements).

THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL INNOVATION
Developments in the FinTech space offer banks new opportunities to enhance efficiency 
and grow their business. Traditional players in the financial sector have used these 
avenues to find new solutions to old problems, with large players investing heavily in 
FinTech and actively pursuing pilots for innovative programs. At the same time, new 
players are able to develop and bring new products to market directly through emerging 
delivery channels and new business models. The potential benefits of FinTech can be 
broadly summarized as follows:
 ●Efficiency: FinTech can bring about substantial efficiency gains for the financial 
services industry and its customers through removing constraints hampering the 
expansion of financial services and delivering a wider range of products to a broader 
range of consumers.133
 ●Competition and new business models: Technological developments and support-
ing regulatory frameworks for services such as e-money and platform models have 
enabled a new class of players to unbundle various financial services and offer a wide 
range of targeted financial services to customers.
 ●Data analysis: Data from an ever-increasing number of digital platforms and appli-
cations—telephone call records, business performance on e-commerce platforms, 
devices connected to IoT, social media and professional networks, and digital transac-
tion histories—can be used to better customize products and services, assess client 
credit worthiness, and evaluate risk.
These developments have encouraged the appearance of new forms of partnerships to 
serve a variety of market segments.
133 Almost 60 percent of adults without an account cite “lack of enough money” as a reason, sometimes among other reasons.

PARTNERSHIPS WITH FINTECH SERVICE PROVIDERS
Traditional banks no longer regard FinTech firms as competitors, but rather partner with 
them to reach new populations and improve routine transactions. Partnerships allow 
financial institutions to quickly, cheaply, and efficiently reap the benefits of new financial 
innovations through the digitization of financial services.
These partnerships are mutually beneficial. Banks receive access to new markets and 
customers. They diversify their payments processes through mobile or digital payments. 
Both can rapidly respond to developments and adapt using agile techniques and new 
technologies. Furthermore, they can develop innovative services, such as mobile loan 
origination, without large capital expenditures and research costs. FinTech companies can 
operate without the constraints of market entry barriers and regulations. Banks also have 
huge customer networks, existing infrastructure, big data analytics, and name recognition 
that new start-ups may lack.
Examples of existing partnerships include use of open APIs to open the bank up to 
developers; use of new technology to provide digital payments procedures or equity 
investments, perhaps in small amounts that would be impractical or difficult for a large 
bank; improved customer authentication and KYC, including biometrics; data analytics to 
better understand and attract customers; and seamless delivery options.
Partnerships allow consumer credit cooperatives to partake of the benefits of digital 
financial services. Digital methods can allow credit cooperatives to provide basic financial 
products to the underserved quickly, cheaply, and easily. They use new marketing channels 
to reach and respond to customers, develop new tailored products and services, and use 
data to provide products to consumers considered risky due to a lack of traditional metrics.
Innovative ways of combining technology with the human “touch” at the front end are 
also important. Frontline agents can help customers with low digital literacy become more 
comfortable using the financial system, assisting in product adoption, solving problems, and 
facilitating trust when using new services.
Empowering the financial partnerships model through the use of cloud-based platforms 
dramatically reduces the costs and improves the efficiency of service provision.
EMPOWERING SME s THROUGH DIGITAL FINANCE
Globally, FinTech companies have developed innovative solutions that can substantially 
improve efficiencies at each step of the lending process. Some of the benefits of FinTech 
for SMEs include the following:
 ●Loan origination. FinTech can reduce costs for banks to originate loans by using plat -
form approaches. For instance, an aggregator’s platform or an online loan comparison 
platform can be used as alternate channels for customer origination. Sophisticated 
e-KYC solutions can be embedded for digital onboarding and the verification of 
customers.
 ●Underwriting. FinTech can use alternative data (such as utility bill payment, social data, 
mobile phone data such as call records, text messages, psychometric data, and so on) 
to determine the creditworthiness of potential borrowers through alternate credit scor -
ing solutions. Manual intensive tasks such as analysis of borrower’s bank statement, 
company’s financial statements, and tax documents can be automated through FinTech 
solutions reducing the credit assessment time drastically. Other solutions such as geo-
tagging provide additional information about the existence and location of the borrow -
er’s property. These help financiers access additional information on small businesses, 
make more informed credit decisions, and potentially reduce collateral requirements.89 COMPETING IN THE DIGITAL AGE: RUSSIA DIGITAL ECONOMY REPORT
 ●Disbursements and collections. E-mandate and pull-payment facilities are helping finan-
cial institutions collect payments on time with minimal manual intervention.
 ●Service and monitoring. Early-warning systems that use multiple-structured and 
unstructured data points assist financial institutions in loan monitoring by assessing 
potential to default.
 ●Marketplace lending. It provides credit to SMEs (and individuals) through online plat -
forms that match lenders (savers, investors) with borrowers. The speed and convenience 
of such loans, as well as the lack of the need for collateral, are important advantages. 
They can also come with lower interest rates if low-cost structures are passed on to 
consumers.
 ●Value chain finance. A significant percentage of the suppliers and distributors are 
SMEs. Technology platforms and e-payment solutions can facilitate access to finance to 
product suppliers and distributors and help gather data about SMEs that would enable 
lending decisions, as well as provide SMEs access to business management tools.
LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY TO ENHANCE REGULATION: REGTECH AND SUPTECH
Regulation and supervision of financial institutions are key areas for ensuring the stability 
and sustainability of the financial market, especially in the era of digitization. There has 
been a dramatic increase in the complexity of operations and the volume of data processed 
since FinTech emerged. This has led to the development of new financial services and 
caused a tightening of regulatory requirements, placing added expense on financial 
organizations to ensure compliance with these requirements. To deal with this fast pace of 
change and regulatory shake-up, a new area of development has emerged called RegTech 
(regulatory technology) and SupTech (supervision technology). RegTech represents the use 
of innovative technologies by financial organizations to improve the efficiency of regulatory 
compliance and risk management. SupTech involves the use of innovative technology by 
regulators to improve the efficiency of regulatory processes and the supervision of financial 
market participants.
THE IMPORTANCE OF DIGITAL ID
Stronger digital authentication and verification mechanisms can provide a necessary step 
toward better digital financial services and digital payment mechanisms. This requires 
striking a necessary balance between the multilevel identification of users and the 
verification of their digital activity online.
ENABLING FINANCIAL INCLUSION
FinTech has the potential to expand the reach of financial services to the unserved and 
underserved populations. Mobile money is illustrative of this potential. As per GSMA, 276 
mobile money deployments are now live in 90 countries and count 690 million registered 
mobile money accounts worldwide. The overall revenue of the mobile money industry was 
estimated at US$2.4 billion in 2017.134
FinTech also has the potential to address the gender gaps in financial inclusion by giving 
women greater control over their finances, removing the barriers of distance and physical 
safety when clients can transact online and are no longer required to travel long distances 
carrying cash to banking institutions.

MANAGING GROWING RISKS
FinTech brings new challenges that may negatively affect financial integrity, consumer 
protection, and financial stability. Maintaining a level playing field between services and 
enhancing consumer protection are major challenges. While overly cautious or inflexible 
regulation may constrain the expansion of FinTech services unnecessarily, the absence of 
effective regulation could increase risks and vulnerabilities for the financial sector and for 
consumers. From a risk perspective, traditional risks pertaining to the underlying product 
and institutions remain while other risks such as money laundering/financing of terrorism, 
data piracy, and consumer vulnerability could be heightened. Specifically, the use of big data 
and new forms of data processing in credit risk assessments raises potential data protection 
and privacy concerns for consumers whose online activity and purchasing patterns are 
analyzed.135
In terms of ensuring a level playing field, the challenge is in finding the right balance between 
regulating financial service providers and opening up opportunities for new entrants into the 
sector. Part of this has to do with ensuring that new entrants and incumbents have fair access 
to financial infrastructure and customer data (or customer interfaces).
5.3.2 FINTECH IN RUSSIA
Digital transformation of the financial sector in Russia is advancing rapidly, setting an example 
for the transformation of other sectors and placing Russia among the top five global leaders in 
this space (Figure 5.8).136
The digital transformation of the finance sector remains a top national priority as emphasized 
in the May 2018 Presidential Decree.
According to the Ernst & Young FinTech 2017 index, the penetration of FinTech solutions in 
cities with a population of over 1 million inhabitants is about 42 percent in Russia, compared 
to 33 percent in the United States. The most common services are e-payments and online

money transfers (68 percent), while savings and investment (12 percent), insurance (14 
percent), planning (4 percent), and cash loans (3 percent) are less common. These solutions 
are provided by both traditional financial institutions such as banks and new market 
entrants.137
Banks have been leading financial innovation. According to a 2017 survey by 
PriceWaterhouseCoopers Russia, 74 percent of financial service providers in Russia plan 
to prioritize FinTech partnerships in the next three to five years with investments in data 
analytics (76 percent) and mobile services (60 percent).138
The world’s largest independent online bank is Russia’s Tinkoff Bank 139—with competitive 
interest rates and a net profit of RUB 7.6 billion (US$131 million) in January–June 2017. The 
digital banking model is being adopted by many lenders, to lower operating costs and 
attract new customers.140
At present, about 250 financial technology sector organizations are registered in Russia. 
These include lenders (microfinance institutions, P2P loans), cryptocurrencies (exchanges, 
digital wallets, digital coins), financial products, and financial management. P2P lending 
is offered by companies such as Loanberry (loans up to RUB 500,000), Fundico (P2P 
cofinancing with risk assessment and legal support), and platforms such as Zaymigo 
and Suretly. Financial management companies include Seeneco (cloud-based financial 
management service for SMEs) and FactorPlat (electronic factoring, integration with all 
accounting systems, a single electronic document management system). Personal financial 
management offerings include Sense (Alfa-bank product) and PandaMoney (Figure 5.9).
Two fully digital banks registered under their own banking license—Tinkoff Bank and 
Modulbank—have been operating since 2002.
According to the IIDF, in 2017, RUB 2.3 billion was invested in the financial technology 
sector and RUB 10.3 billion in solutions for business, totaling to RUB 12.6 billion.141
FinTech development is regulated by the Central Bank of Russia, which supervises financial 
markets, financial activities, and the licensing of new financial technologies. The Central 
Bank also monitors the cryptocurrency market. It has recently published a draft road map 
and strategy for FinTech development in Russia.

MASTERCHAIN
Developed by the Fintech Association (under Russia’s Central Bank), MasterChain is an Ethereum-based blockchain 
software enhanced by domestic cryptography to be tested first as a national payments system, and eventually as a 
supra-national payments system at the level of the EAEU.
Potential applications include a decentralized depository system for the registration of mortgages; Know-Your-Customer 
remote client identification initiatives to reduce the risk of fraud; increasing the security of bank guarantees through 
distributed regsitry and the use of smart contracts; increasing operational efficiency by automating financial transactions 
and reducing paperwork through issuing electronic letters of credit.GLOBAL BEST PRACTICE FOR ACCELERATING BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION IN RUSSIA  92
In February 2018, it issued the Guidelines for Financial Technologies Development for 
2018–2020.142 The new guidelines propose a series of measures that govern the use 
of financial technologies, including the adoption of relevant legislation as well as the 
development of remote identification platforms, platforms for financial products and 
services, and the application of blockchain and cloud technologies in the sector. Open APIs 
are recommended to communicate effectively. The objective is to level the playing field for 
new entrants to the market and boost the competitiveness of the Russian finance sector.143
THE CASHLESS ECONOMY IN RUSSIA
The move toward a “cashless economy” is one of the priorities of financial regulators in 
many countries, including Russia. The goal is to use digital technologies to dramatically 
reduce reliance on cash, thus helping to decrease the influence of the informal economy, 
improve efficiency in the financial sector, and enhance transparency, growth, and inclusion.
Cash is the most common payment method for retail payments in the Russia144. Bank-
issued debit and credit cards are by far the most popular mode of noncash payments. In 
addition to internationally branded cards, a domestic national debit card under the brand 
name “MIR” was launched in 2015 by the National System of Payment Cards (NSPC), 
a fully owned subsidiary of the Central Bank of Russia. International remittances are 
typically transferred through money transfer operators (MTOs), which are licensed as credit 
organizations under banking legislation to provide fund transfer services.
Today Russians are increasingly using online and mobile channels for transactions, 
providing an opportunity to increase both access and usage. About 22.0 percent of 
account holders used the Internet for transactions, and 13.9 percent of adults used mobile 
phones to make transactions, including making payments, purchases, or sending and 
receiving money.145 This places Russia in line with Germany (12.8 percent) and well above 
the average of 3.8 percent in the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) Region.

In 2015, more than 317 million active e-money accounts (prepaid cards, e-wallets, and so 
on) were reported in Russia and over 1.2 billion e-money transactions were conducted, 
the total volume of which amounted to RUB 912 billion.146 Internet payments are on 
the rise. In 2017, 40 percent of total payments were made through Internet banking 
systems.147
Opportunities exist to further shift to digital channels to increase access and usage for 
consumers and lower operational costs for providers. For example, of the pensioners 
with deposits/savings in an account, only 6 percent have used a mobile device to make 
payments.148 Similarly, the use of mobile channels for sending and receiving remittances 
stands below 10 percent, which could be further increased, as according to the 2016 
National Agency for Financial Studies (NAFI) survey149, only 3 percent of respondents said 
they had used their e-wallets in the last 12 months. Leveraging frontline agents with a 
“human touch” can be the missing link to encourage new users to use digital solutions.
More growth is also expected in e-commerce. E-commerce transactions using digital 
wallets reached 26.7 percent in 2016.150 Although the size of the e-commerce market in 
Russia grew by 21.4 percent in 2017 and is expected to grow by 33 percent in 2018, it still 
only represents 3–4 percent of the total Russian retail market. 151 The implementation of a 
national digital ID system would accelerate e-commerce growth.
Thus, in the broader context of the Russian digital economy, advances in FinTech help 
enhance financial inclusion and the development of a cashless economy. Improved 
financial inclusion allows for greater integration into the formal economy, making it easier 
to conduct day-to-day transactions, finance businesses, mitigate economic shocks, and 
improve welfare. A cashless economy promotes benefits in transparency, increased 
economic sustainability, and higher rates of growth.

CASHLESS PAYMENTS IN RUSSIA
According to a report from the Skolkovo School of Management, the share of cashless retail payments in Russia today 
is about 40 percent, while cashless payment methods are actively used by more than 50 percent of the population—yet 
the growth of cashless payments has remained slow.a For Russia, cashless payments have benefits for the government 
in reducing the influence of shocks and increasing the speed and number of transactions. They help merchants, 
infrastructure, and technology service providers secure new clients while retaining old ones. They help banks become 
more profitable and devise new products through big data analytics. They also help consumers through offering 
added convenience and security and enable law enforcement agencies to conduct investigations and increase the 
transparency of financial flows, with the potential impact of shrinking the shadow economy. At the global economy 
level, it helps enhance efficiency of the customs union, lower costs across the value chain, and facilitate new decisions 
for regulators and the Central Bank.b

DIGITAL ID
The growth of FinTech offers an opportunity to create an end-to-end digital identification 
mechanism (including remote and digital ID) that enhances and streamlines digital 
payments in Russia and thus creates a national digital payments infrastructure.
Biometric solutions, for example, the biometric identification platform recently piloted 
by Rostelecom that enables clients to open a bank account remotely, are also useful in 
providing a template for strong digital customer authentication systems that are digital by 
default and device agnostic by design.
The FinTech Strategy of the Central Bank of Russia emphasizes remote ID legislation as 
a key goal. The strategy establishes the use of biometrics in the Unified Identification 
and Authentication System and expands the use of electronic signatures for online 
services. At present, credit organizations are prohibited from opening accounts and 
deposits remotely. In 2017, the Central Bank launched the implementation of the Unified 
Identification and Authentication System for the government state services portal that 
enables users to open an account in any bank remotely after receiving digital approval 
from one of Russia’s credit institutions. Further development of these solutions will 
simplify digital transactions over the Internet and increase the availability of financial 
services.BOX 5.15
ATTITUDES TOWARD FINTECH IN RUSSIA
In 2017, the Skolkovo School of Management conducted a field survey, which covered 1,500 respondents in Russia. 
This survey focused on retail payments and assessed perceptions toward financial innovation.
Sixty-three percent of all respondents found it difficult to answer what “financial innovations” were, 13 percent replied 
that this was something new in the financial sphere, and 4 percent indicated that financial innovations were about 
convenience and simplicity. When choosing from the list of proposed options, respondents most often considered 
payments by bank cards (60 percent) and e-payments via a mobile phone (52 percent) as financial innovations.
When it came to electronic financial transactions, 41 percent said that they did not use them, 27 percent indicated 
that they predominantly used computers, and 26 percent used mobile phones. The share of gadgets used by young 
people under 25 years was almost twice as high as those older than 55. Thirty-three percent of respondents indicated 
a reluctance to use electronic devices for banking transactions, while 23 percent said that the operations were too 
complex. The most common services used to make financial transactions were through mobile banking applications (64 
percent). The second most popular mode was through Internet banking (57 percent). For all services, older respondents 
were less likely to use these services.
In terms of the urban-rural divide, 78 percent of respondents in cities with population of 500,000—1 million used mobile 
banking applications and the same rate was recorded for cities with 50,000–100,000 inhabitants. Among villagers, 56 
percent of respondents used mobile banking and 42 percent used Internet banking.
In terms of what respondents considered to be the main advantages of financial technologies, 54 percent said it was 
about saving time, and 49 percent about convenience and comfort. Significantly, respondents had more confidence and 
trust in financial innovations developed by banks (54 percent) than other developers (40 percent).

RUSSIA’S SUCCESS IN FINANCIAL INCLUSION152
The number of adults with accounts at a financial institution stands at 67.4 percent, which is 
well above the average rate of 51.4 percent in the Europe and Central Asia Region. Account 
penetration has increased by nearly 20 percent since 2011, with increases experienced 
across all segments of the population, including for the poorest 40 percent and for 
women.153 Access to traditional financial institutions is high with 30 branches per 100,000 
adults in 2016—higher than China (9) and slightly lower than the United States (33).154
Success has been enabled by a combination of targeted financial services and govern -
ment-led financial education efforts.
In September 2017, the Government of Russia approved the National Financial Literacy 
Improvement Strategy. It has also established three federal training centers for financial 
literacy with a network of 13 regional training centers to train the trainers and develop 
user-friendly educational material. In addition, an online portal and an online kiosk platform 
providing guidance to consumers on their rights have been launched.155
Digital finance can help address the remaining gaps in financial inclusion, such as reaching 
the “last mile”—those segments of the population that are difficult to reach through 
traditional means. Physical access to financial services remains centered in major urban 
areas, and account penetration drops outside of these urban centers. Low-income and 
elderly populations are also underserved.
Improvements in rural broadband infrastructure, targeted financial education initiatives, 
as well as further partnerships between e-money providers, mobile network operators, 
and traditional financial providers would help offer services adapted to the needs of the 
currently underserved market segments.
5.3.3 POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
There are seven broad opportunities for Russia to leverage digital finance technologies:
 ●Develop appropriate regulatory and legal frameworks to help provide a conducive 
environment for the further development of FinTech in Russia in a way that ensures the 
stability, safety, efficiency, and integrity of the financial system.
 ●Apply technology (RegTech / SupTech) to enable agile regulation to maintain a balance 
between service innovation and the privacy and security of user data, as well as to 
enhance the transparency of financial products and services, guarantee customer rights, 
and protect financial market players from unreasonable operational risks.
 ●Maintain focus on cybersecurity and prepare to manage new risks.
 ●Strengthen Russia’s financial infrastructure to accelerate the move to an increasingly 
cashless economy through developing an ecosystem approach among all the players in 
the field.
 ●Expand the reach of financial services to underserved customers by fostering 
partnerships between FinTech companies, e-money providers, banks, nonbank credit 
organizations and consumer credit counseling (CCC) services while also encouraging 
CCC services to further embrace digitization, including through the use of cloud-based 
solutions.

159 World Bank. 2016.Digital entrepreneurship is a critical area for future innovation breakthroughs. In Russia, 
it is supported by a number of government initiatives, yet weaknesses in the innovation 
ecosystem as well as a historical lack of an open innovation culture that respects 
entrepreneurs and encourages risk-taking have led to stagnation in this space. VC 
investments have plateaued and the number of successful exits has declined in recent 
years. Improving the coordination between different policy instruments, incentivizing 
SoEs to accelerate digital transformation and drive demand for innovation, ensuring the 
predictability of the business environment, and internationalizing the Russian start-up 
ecosystem are necessary.
6.1 Global Trends in Digital Entrepreneurship
Digital technology is transforming and disrupting traditional brick-and-mortar sectors as 
the boundaries that once protected them disappear. Manual and cognitive human labor 
is being augmented and displaced by technology, creating new efficiencies, but affecting 
labor markets in both developing and developed countries in uncertain ways. Value 
creation is more and more driven by scalable businesses that embrace new digital business 
models and markets. Evidence shows that digital data flows have increased exponentially 
in the last 12 years, while the value of trade of goods in the global economy has been 
stagnating or declining for the last 5 years.156
The exponential pace of technological development is reducing both the cost.157 and the 
barriers of access to markets and resources for technology start-ups. Digitization has thus 
led to radically lower barriers for innovation, which is no longer only driven by scientific 
breakthroughs that are commercialized in large companies but increasingly by agile, fast-
growing start-ups. In the words of one private investor, if in the 1990s an entrepreneur 
needed US$2 million and months of work to develop a minimum viable prototype, today 
s/he would need less than US$50,000 and six weeks of work.158 Technology start-
ups have driven innovation and economic transformation faster than any other type of 
entrepreneurship in the past. According to the World Bank’s WDR 2016,159 countries in 
transition should pay special attention to the competition and disruption that new agile 
entrants can bring to previously protected or uncompetitive markets as a way of introducing 
new type of dynamism into the economy.CHAPTER 6
101 COMPETING IN THE DIGITAL AGE: RUSSIA DIGITAL ECONOMY REPORT
As innovation shifts from large R&D facilities to ecosystems where 
collaboration, cumulative inventions, rapid prototyping, adoption, and 
entrepreneurial activity are the norm, supporting and facilitating start-up 
entrepreneurship is fast becoming central to public innovation policies.160 
Recognizing that new modes of knowledge production and innovation 
largely take place outside the direct influence of government agencies,161 
innovation policy makers have started to experiment with a more versatile 
mix of funding and other policy instruments that encourage innovation from 
both supply and demand sides. These include proactive regulation, support 
for experimentation, innovative procurement mechanisms, and ecosystem 
facilitation.162
Significant increases in investments in science and technology, particularly in 
China, but also in other emerging markets, have shifted the global distribution 
of knowledge and innovation resources in favor of Asia. Whereas innovation 
used to flow mostly in one direction, from highly developed to emerging 
economies, these flows are becoming increasingly two-way.163 The OECD164 predicts that 
while global production and diffusion of new knowledge will intensify, so will competition 
for talent and resources between countries and regions.
The centrality of technology start-ups in the digital economy presents an opportunity for 
developing countries. India hosts major start-up ecosystems in New Delhi and Bangalore, 
which have raised US$1.5 billion in funding in 2016,165 respectively. São Paulo ranks among 
the top 20 start-up ecosystems with more than 1,500 active start-ups, closely followed in 
the region by Santiago and Buenos Aires.166 Bangkok has been adding over 3,000 jobs a 
year to its ICT industry.167 Unicorns, those start-ups that raise more than US$1 billion, are 
no longer just a U.S. or European phenomenon. Indian, Chinese, and Indonesian start-ups, 
such as Lu.com, Flipkart, or Go-Jek, have reached this valuation, and African Internet Group 
from Nigeria is poised to be the first African unicorn.168
Beyond the direct impacts start-ups have on organizations and people associated with 
them, their economic and societal impact is also realized through creating and exploiting 
new knowledge, products, services, and business models. Local entrepreneurs develop 
new business solutions that address domestic demands. Start-ups can stimulate 
competition and efficiency in the markets and expand the total amount of knowledge in the 
ecosystem, strengthening the basis for new innovations and ideas to emerge. Even if the 
companies themselves fail, they can create lasting societal impact and spillovers, although 
the latter require a well-functioning, supportive ecosystem to be realized.169
The innovation systems approach to developing national innovation capabilities has 
influenced policies and funding agencies around the world, especially in Northern Europe in 
countries such as Sweden and Finland. Key elements of this have been systematic support 
for knowledge transfer, PPPs and support for science-technology-industry collaboration, 
often with the state in a facilitation role through triple-helix models or competence-
centers.170 While the basic tenets of these type of approaches still hold, globalization and 
the changing nature of innovation processes challenge traditional PPP models.171

INGREDIENTS FOR SUCCESSFUL START-UP ECOSYSTEMS
The OECD predicts that as global production and diffusion of new knowledge intensifies, 
so will competition for talent and resources between countries, regions, and cities, and their 
start-up ecosystems.
A start-up ecosystem consists of people, tech start-ups at various stages of development, 
and other stakeholders and organizations supporting or connecting these start-ups, 
interacting in multiple dimensions to create and scale new start-up ventures.172
Whereas traditional business clusters have been characterized by a pattern of horizontal 
competition between companies in similar value-chain positions, start-up, or entrepreneurial 
ecosystems are often marked by horizontal cooperation and networking but vertical 
competition against industry incumbents located outside the cluster. There is often a 
strong sense of community between start-ups, which assists in creating conditions for P2P 
learning, for example, in business skills development and scaling up of radical business 
models.173
From an innovation policy perspective, the public sector can support ecosystem-level 
organization in several ways. It can provide accelerators and co-working spaces, facilitate 
interaction dynamics between the ecosystem participants, encourage business model 
experimentation and spillovers of experiences, and generate momentum around new 
digital platforms. Creation of regulatory sandboxes has been explored in many countries to 
create spaces for experimentation outside existing regulations. Encouraging private finance 
in the form of business angel funding or VCs has a key role in ecosystem development, in 
addition to public R&D funding.
To build thriving innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystems, many key factors need to 
be in place. A World Bank working paper174 identified four general categories of ingredients 
needed for these ecosystems to succeed. These elements can be used to assess the 
maturity of each ecosystem.
 ●Supporting infrastructure. The quantity and quality of support programs and resources 
for start-ups to succeed. Tech start-up infrastructure can be characterized as the institu -
tions, programs, and networks that support entrepreneurs and their teams. Supporting

ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GOVERNMENT INNOVATION POLICIES
Governments can improve a country’s science, technology, and innovation (STI) performance by correcting for the 
uncertainties inherent in the process of innovation. However, few governments can answer with confidence, basic 
questions of how much is being spent, by whom, for what purpose, and with what results, and especially whether 
public policy is generating expected results and impact on social and economic development. In innovation policy, it 
is common for governments to act on the assumption that providing more money will automatically boost innovation. 
Governments also underestimate the complexity of innovation policy development process and the multiple factors that 
influence policy results and affect policy impact.
The World Bank Public Expenditure Review (PER) framework helps governments assess the impact of STI public 
spending on economic and social development. Resulting recommendations propose program and policy reforms to 
help increase the operational efficiency and effectiveness of public spending.a
a. Correa 2014. 103 COMPETING IN THE DIGITAL AGE: RUSSIA DIGITAL ECONOMY REPORT
infrastructure encompasses accelerators and business incubators, mentors, events, and 
other ecosystem and/or skills building resources. Accelerators are support programs for 
entrepreneurs and start-ups typically in the early stages of development. Incubators are 
spaces that support start-ups by providing an office space and administrative support 
services.
 ●Skills. The availability of human capital and the educational and work experience 
that start-up founders have. It is crucial that the education system can provide skills 
to respond to demand from the digitalizing economy and new ventures. The role of 
universities in supporting student-led entrepreneurship movements and academic or 
research-based entrepreneurship has been important in many countries. Bootcamps, 
accelerators, and mentors should be leveraged to produce future skills and jobs. The 
OECD175 predicts that while global production and diffusion of new knowledge will inten-
sify, so will competition for talent and resources between countries and regions, and 
their start-up ecosystems.
 ●Finance. The availability of capital critical to the success of a tech start-up ecosystem. 
This includes all organizations that invest in high-growth start-ups: public agencies 
and funds, VC firms, angel investors, and other individuals. New developments such 
as crowdfunding platforms can also help the development of microentrepreneurs and 
provide access to seed financing as equity investments are being developed.
 ●Community. The maturity of the ecosystem as a network of stakeholders that support 
each other (directly or indirectly) for the successful outcome of start-ups. The tighter and 
more connected an ecosystem, the more efficient are knowledge spillovers and access 
to resources. Social connectivity matters because the success of start-ups is affected

ISRAEL, THE START-UP NATION: SUCCESS FACTORS
 ●Government’s strategic positioning of Israel as a 
‘start-up nation’ at the core of the global knowledge 
economy.
 ●Government taking the lead by laying the foundations 
for private industry to support innovation, and through 
heavy investment into human capital through the 
public higher-education system, resulting in a highly 
skilled workforce (further enhanced by highly skilled 
immigrants arriving from Russia in the 1990s).
 ●Spillover effects from government investments into 
military and defense technology.
 ●An effective ICT ecosystem in Tel Aviv and Haifa, 
close to leading public academic institutes: Technion - 
Israel Institute of Technology and Tel Aviv University.
 ●Government policies to attract large multinational 
corporations in search of new technologies to buy 
small start-ups and establish local R&D centers. Today 
there are 298 multinational companies in Israel with 
local R&D centers, for example, IBM, Intel, Apple, 
Cisco, Motorola, and Microsoft, to name a few. ●Export orientation of ICT companies enabled by 
moving marketing and headquarters out of Israel 
close to U.S. and European customers while keeping 
R&D in Israel.
 ●Focus on software and cybersecurity. About 200 
Israeli companies specialize in cybersecurity, one-
quarter of the world’s VC-funded cybersecurity 
start-ups are Israeli. A comprehensive cybersecurity 
development complex is built in Beersheba.
 ●Promoting an innovation culture that encourages 
young people to take risks, a supportive business 
environment, a vibrant start-up community, and 
access to capital.
 ●Attracting experienced Israelis living abroad back into 
the country.
 ●Academic institutions’ dedication to engineering, 
emphasis on world class education, excellence in 
math a foundation for educating engineers.
 ●A superior infrastructure to support the growth of the 
high-tech industry.

by their network and access to other ecosystem stakeholders and their networks. The 
success of start-ups is closely linked to the maturity, health, and sustainability of the 
community.
Previous World Bank research176 shows that centrality—the number of ecosystem stakehold-
ers to which a founder is directly or indirectly connected—is critical for start-up success. 
This finding is also consistent with research from Endeavor Insight that showed that access 
to mentors increases the probability of start-up success. In this environment, the supporting 
infrastructure acts both as a skills and network provider and is critical for ecosystem sus -
tainability. The ecosystem’s supportive infrastructure mainly comprises networking assets. 
(Figure 6.1) Interactions and collisions among people are critical in creating and maintaining 
entrepreneurial ecosystems.177 Interaction can be facilitated by various events and spaces: 
meetups, competitions, hackathons, co-working spaces, accelerators, 
and boot camps. These networking assets are central to the connections 
among entrepreneurs and the sustainability of the start-up communities.
Successful start-up ecosystems rely primarily on the availability of private 
capital, as well as investment from publicly owned or supported VC funds or 
public R&D and innovation funding targeting local start-ups.178 Evidence from 
public sector involvement through public VCs is mixed, but it seems that a 
modest amount of public finance and an active but relatively small role of the 
state improves the performance of ventures in relation to ventures supported 
by purely private venture capitalists.179 For example, in China, government 
R&D support policies and instruments have a positive effect on SME growth but only in so far 
as the companies supported are privately owned.180 A recent evaluation of the role of Tekes, 
the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation, on start-up growth and performance came to the

START-UP COMMUNITY BUILDING IN FINLAND
The success of the Finnish start-up community has its 
origins in a student-led entrepreneurship movement that 
began about 10 years ago. Through a collective, commu-
nity-based approach, key initiatives such as the Start-up 
Sauna accelerator and the Slush start-up event were 
developed by student-led management teams supported 
by a network of experienced mentors and the Startup 
Foundation established in 2012. The movement’s initiatives 
continue to prosper. The Aalto Entrepreneurship Society, 
created by Aalto University students, has now become 
the largest community for university entrepreneurship in 
Europe. Start-up Sauna accelerator now attracts around 
1,500 global applications per year, with acceptance rates 
of less than 2 percent, and Slush has become one of the 
world’s biggest start-up events, expanding into Asia. The 
2018 Startup Genome Global Ecosystem Report ranked 
Helsinki #1 for local connectedness, demonstrating the 
strong connections within the community.
The hallmark of this movement has been a kind of “think 
big, act small” approach and a pay-it-forward culture, in which successful entrepreneurs repay their debt to the 
community in many ways. The state has provided ample 
support for the grassroots movement, but has never 
dictated what the community should do or where it should 
focus. Finland’s start-up community has excelled in inte-
grating investors deeply into start-up ecosystems, some-
times getting investors to volunteer as start-up coaches. 
Given the limited size of the Finnish market, small compa-
nies and start-up ecosystem actors need to internationalize 
rapidly, which has been helped by experienced mentors’ 
international contacts.
Helsinki hosts the Slush conference for young innovative 
companies, that in 2017 attracted close to 20,000 visitors 
from 130 countries. The national innovation funding agency 
Tekes has been a substantial early-stage investor in start-
ups, providing 33 percent of early-stage funding in 2016. 
The significant decline since 2011, when Tekes provided 55 
percent of early-stage investment, is a sign of the growing 
role of private VCs and angels and the success of the com-
munity (Figure 6.2).GLOBAL BEST PRACTICE FOR BOOSTING DIGITAL INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN RUSSIA  106
ASSESSING THE MATURITY OF A START-UP ECOSYSTEM
Based on the above elements, it is possible to assess the maturity of a start-up 
ecosystem.182 The assessment introduces three stages of ecosystem maturity: nascent, 
advancing, and mature. A nascent start-up ecosystem is typically characterized by a limited 
number of start-ups, most of which are at an early stage, with a low density of connections 
between founders, investors, and other stakeholders. Business acumen and experience 
among founders is limited, the number of serial entrepreneurs who can enrich ecosystem’s 
skills base is very small, and substantial start-up exits are nonexistent. Mentors are scarce 
and inexperienced, and the ecosystem does not have international linkages.
In an advancing ecosystem, more start-ups emerge within the ecosystem: most of them 
are still in early stage but there are some successful examples of scale-ups. Several strong 
concentrated clusters emerge, increasing the density of connections within the ecosystem. 
While business acumen is still in short supply, successful start-up exits and serial 
entrepreneurs begin to appear, as well as mentors with practical experience in the field. 
Financial pipeline is established and effective, though some gaps still exist. Private early 
stage investments are available, and international linkages begin to strengthen.
A mature start-up ecosystem consists of a large number of start-ups at all stages. The 
ecosystem comprises highly dense clusters that are connected to each other. Founders, 
investors, and mentors with business acumen and practical experience are plentiful within 
the ecosystem, and start-ups successfully exit. International players are aware of the 
ecosystem and interested in developing stronger linkages with founders, investors, and 
mentors. Private early-stage financing is readily available and sustainable.
Findings from a recent World Bank report on Beirut’s start-up ecosystem183 illustrate this 
assessment approach. Beirut has an early-to-middle stage start-up ecosystem that has 
passed its nascent growth phase but is still far from maturity. The key strengths of the 
ecosystem are highly educated start-up founders with sufficient relevant experience, and 
the availability of funding for early-stage start-ups. The supporting infrastructure and the 
community is still maturing; like-minded individuals do not connect easily with one another to 
form clusters, suggesting a silo approach among ventures from different networks.

Cairo, Medellín, Bogotá, Singapore, Santiago, Beirut, Dar es Salaam, and West Bank and Gaza to estimate and rank 
the effects of support programs, founder characteristics, and business environments on funding outcomes. The study 
included 2,887 unique start-ups, 68 accelerators, 247 incubators, and other support programs, 717 individual investors 
(“angels”), and 869 institutional investors (“VC firms”) gathered through surveys of over 3,000 entrepreneurs between 
2013 and 2017. The study confirmed that start-up participation in support programs (supporting infrastructure) has the 
greatest effect on its ability to attract funding compared to other factors such as founder skills or the regional business 
environment. Furthermore, the study found that support programs such as mentorship may be just as effective as 
improvements in business environment or founder skills.b

The performance of accelerators varies between ecosystems, and accelerator programs 
do not always add value to participating start-ups and the ecosystem. The study184 also 
demonstrated that only ecosystems with more advanced and sophisticated international 
accelerators, such as New York and Santiago, have a substantial positive impact on 
sustainable start-ups beyond the first round of funding.
IMPACT OF START-UPS ON EXISTING INDUSTRIES
Existing companies are struggling to adapt to the rapid pace of digital transformation and 
the resulting changes in the competitive environment. This causes transformative changes in 
core sectors of the economy, from hospitality to retail and urban transportation. Established 
companies tend to have good structures for marketing, distribution, processes, and scaling up 
products but are often weaker in generating and rapidly applying creativity to develop new 
products and services. Traditional innovation models to create products and services are ill-
suited to match the pace and agility of competitive disruption from tech actors, whether large 
technology platforms with unbeatable access to data and capital, such as Google or Amazon, 
or small and agile local start-ups. Thus, a new corporate innovation model, “Corporate 
Innovation 2.0,” is emerging.
Through it, traditional businesses are trying to address their weaknesses by adopting open 
innovation practices, where multiple players interact and reinforce each other through 
collaboration and cumulative inventions. Existing companies are increasingly trying to absorb 
innovations and technology developed by start-ups. This is demonstrated by the growing 
interest by large corporations in scouting, nurturing, and growing start-ups in maturing 
ecosystems. A recent survey of almost 3,000 firms with revenues over US$250 million in 
the United States and Europe found that almost 80 percent of them are using some kind of 
open innovation methods and practices.185 Some companies are integrating tech shops into 
their facilities to develop open innovation and rapid prototyping. Most of these practices are 
internal and are more prevalent in large companies and technology-driven sectors.

Governments can help foster an environment for open collaboration through spaces such 
as industry innovation labs that bring together companies, academia, entrepreneurs, users, 
and government to build networks, share knowledge, and produce shared inventions. A 
good example is the digital manufacturing lab in Chicago, which comprises a network of 
universities, companies, and government with an open innovation approach in manufacturing. 
In Europe, there is a network of living labs that are evolving organically toward a more 
connected ecosystem structure with universities, companies, government, and civil society.
THE INNOVATION ECOSYSTEM DRIVES NEW JOBS CREATION
The majority of new jobs associated with innovation and start-ups are not in the start-
ups themselves but in traditional industries that have incorporated new knowledge and 
technology in their processes due to competitive pressures from new business models 
generated by start-ups, or innovation absorption from the start-up ecosystem. In New York 
City (Box 6.5), traditional industries generated three times more of these new jobs than start-
ups themselves, serving as multipliers of new jobs catalyzed by the start-ups. Interestingly, 
these new jobs include both low – and high-skilled tech workers in similar proportions,186 
allowing for equal-opportunity growth.
In maturing start-up ecosystems, large corporations often become actively involved 
in scouting, nurturing and growing start-ups co-developing solutions that benefit the 
corporations. Three main approaches are used to identify and nurture such relationships and 
solutions:
 ●Corporate accelerators. This approach consists of creating corporate accelerators in 
areas linked to the corporation’s market. The goal is to link with new business ideas and 
ultimately invest or absorb these ventures as they grow. This is the approach followed by 
Telefonica with Wayra187 accelerator and Barclays Bank with its program of FinTech accel-
erators.188 Softbank in Japan has taken this approach further, operating as one of the larg-
est VC funds in new technology ventures.
 ●Competitions to generate new products and services. Corporations apply this mecha-
nism to generate business ideas for new products and services. The result of a competi-
tion such as BBVA’s annual open talent189 is a minimum viable prototype from the start-up, 
which is then acquired by the corporation. As in the previous case, the challenge is 
absorption of the product and, more broadly, the absorption and sustainability of the 
process itself by the corporation. These competitions have been managed directly by 
corporations but also increasingly by accelerators and other intermediaries such as Start-
up500190 and Nest191with access to a global reach of innovative start-ups.
 ●Co-creation of new products and services. This approach takes the competition 
process a step further, significantly increasing the likelihood of innovation absorption 
by the corporation. Innovative ideas are sourced from start-ups through challenges. 
Once a short list of these ideas is selected, start-ups work with the corporation’s devel-
opment team to jointly co-create a new product or service. This co-creation process is 
essential, because it enables the corporation’s direct absorption of the new product or 
service while also transforming the corporate innovation culture and process. In Europe, 
a network of living labs is evolving organically toward a more connected ecosystem 
with universities, companies, government, and civil society. This network has introduced 
collaborative common approaches, providing a platform to build connected innovation 
ecosystems.

NEW YORK TECH START-UPS
In response to massive layoffs in the wake of the 2008–2009 financial crisis, New York City, a city heavy on 
traditional industries such as finance, fashion, media, and health care, adopted a range of policies to support the rapid 
development of the start-up ecosystem in the city to help retain the workforce in New York and productively absorb 
new talent. New York City government rapidly introduced a number of mentorship programs, accelerators, incubators, 
co-working spaces, events, skills training programs, and other supporting services. The boom in New York’s urban tech 
start-up ecosystem followed, creating new jobs and new markets, as well as increasing competitiveness of traditional 
New York City industries through digitization. Jobs in the city’s technology sector have increased faster than in other 
sectors and accounted for 12 percent of city tax revenue.a From 2006 to 2013, the technology innovation ecosystem in 
New York City created over 500,000 new jobs.
Not only have New York City tech start-ups introduced technology to the city’s local industries, but they have also 
created new market categories. Figure 6.4 provides examples of new market categories and business models created 
by the tech start-up ecosystem. As the ecosystem matured, it attracted R&D, innovation, and product development 
functions from leading tech companies outside the city such as Google, Facebook, and IBM, further diversifying the 
local economy and providing another source of competitiveness.

6.2 Digital Entrepreneurship 
and Innovation in Russia
LANDSCAPE OF INNOVATION AND DIGITAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN RUSSIA
Overall gross domestic spending on R&D in Russia is still low at 1.1 percent of GDP in 2016, 
compared to 2.7 percent in the United States, 2.1 percent in China, and 4.3 percent in Israel.192 
Key weaknesses are the low business contribution to gross domestic R&D expenditure 
amounting only to 26.5 percent in Russia, comparing to 74.4 percent in China, 64.2 percent 
in the United States, 48.4 percent in the United Kingdom,193 and the low level of R&D and 
innovation activity within Russian firms. Russian manufacturing companies demonstrate a very 
low-level engagement in innovation compared to high-income and most low – and middle-
income countries. For example, only 8 percent of manufacturing companies in Russia in 2015 
stated that they engaged in product innovation, compared with 43.8 percent in Germany, 
28.4 percent in the United Kingdom, 16.8 percent in South Africa, and 26.1 percent in China.194 
Russian patent applications constitute around 1.5 percent of global applications and domestic 
patent applications have declined in recent years (8.6 per cent from 2015 to 2016).195 Labor 
and capital productivity have been in decline since 2014.
In terms of its overall innovation landscape, Russia’s progress is still noticeable. In the 
quality of its business environment, Russia ranks 35 in the 2018 World Bank Doing Business 
Indicator, up from 123 in 2011, now close to Japan (34) and France (31), and ahead of Israel 
(54), Belgium (52) and all the BRICS countries.196
It is 45th in the 2017 Global Innovation Index,197 up from 53rd in 2014, and 38th in the 2017 
Global Competitiveness Index.198 In high-tech exports, Russia ranked 30 of 132 countries 
with exports of digital goods and services constituting 0.5 percent of GDP, compared to 
India at 2.9 percent and China at 5.8 percent. Exports of software, mainly offshore software 
development, was the fastest growing export service niche with an average growth rate of 15 
percent.199
Whereas overall spending on R&D is still relatively low, government support for private sector 
R&D in Russia, including both direct funding and indirect instruments such as tax incentives, a 
share of GDP is high by international comparison, well above OECD countries such as France, 
Japan, or the United States.200 This implies both commitment from the Russian government 
to invest in private sector R&D and innovation and a possible over-reliance on government 
funding.
In recent years, Russia has prioritized supporting domestic technology development, 
creating local technology start-ups, and encouraging innovation within SoEs. Moreover, the 
government has strongly promoted cooperation between academia, the private and public 
sectors in the context of the Russian Digital Economy Program, the NTI, and the National 
Champions Initiative. Both initiatives encourage the development of national high-tech 
companies to become international leaders of the future. The May 2018 Presidential Decree 
highlights technology innovation as key to achieving the 2024 national development goals

and sets the target for 50 percent of all Russian organizations to be actively engaged in 
technology innovation.
Some commercial success is visible, although not attributable to recent government 
initiatives, as Russian companies lead in several consumer segments. Russian social networks 
VKontakte and Odnoklassniki have nearly 160 million active users and operate as digital 
platforms. Yandex, a popular search engine with a diverse digital product portfolio, is one of 
the 25 largest internet companies in the world.201
Compared to global peers, however, the international outreach of Russia’s technology 
companies is limited, so is their rate of growth. There is only one Unicorn (Avito) (Figure 
6.5)—a sign of structural weaknesses in the start-up and innovation ecosystem.
ASSESSING THE MATURITY OF THE RUSSIAN ECOSYSTEM
An analysis of the Russian start-up ecosystem (the case of Moscow) based on data from the 
Global Startup Ecosystem Report 2017 by Startup Genome reveals strength in supporting 
infrastructure and skills and weakness in community development and investment.
Overall status of the Russian ecosystem – Ascending (Figure 6.6).
SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE STRENGTH
Strong Government Support
The role of the state is significant in supporting the Russian start-up ecosystem. The 
Government Resolution 218 on cooperation between research institutions and organizations 
sets forth subsidies distributed competitively to enterprises to fund complex high-tech 
projects in cooperation with universities. These funds, however, are mostly used to support 
existing projects rather than for investment in new innovative and potentially risky initiatives.

The key state agencies driving start-up entrepreneurship are the Agency for Strategic 
Initiatives, the Innovation Promotion Fund, the SME Corporation, Skolkovo Innovation 
center, the IIDF, the RVC, and Russian Corporation for Nanotechnologies (RUSNANO).
In the last few years the government implemented a number of programs to support 
technology exports. In 2015, the Russian Export Center was established to serve as the 
primary point of contact to help technological companies boost exports, working together 
with EXAIR, the export credit and investment agency, and ROSEXIMBANK. And technology 
exports have been growing steadily (Figure 6.7).FIGURE 6.6  Maturity of BRICS Countries Ecosystems

The focus on implementing locally developed digital solutions in growing Russia’s digital 
economy, emphasized in the May 2018 Presidential Decree, should help stimulate domestic 
demand for technology innovation and further boost the growth of the Russian ICT sector.
WEAKNESSES IN THE START-UP ECOSYSTEM
While the key players of the start-up ecosystem are in place in Russia, ecosystem 
performance is negatively affected by the weak links and coordination among key players.
Several government organizations specialize in ICT R&D in Russia, but they are not 
integrated into a single ecosystem with the ICT sector, which leads to a poor understanding 
of business needs and a poor ability of developing the right products for the right customer.
Weaknesses in the ecosystem links negatively affect cooperation between Russian 
academia and business. The share of industrial enterprises in joint research projects has 
decreased by 9 percent since 2015. Universities have an average of just 4.3 agreements 
with technology companies per 100 researchers.202 This is partly caused by the preference 
of large corporate players to procure tried and tested solutions from established local 
and global players, on the one hand, and their frustration with the perceived lack of ability 
of local research institutions to understand corporate needs, generate the products and 
services to address them and commercialize and market those solutions to potential 
customers, on the other hand.
Government support for innovation in the regions through regional technoparks and 
innovation clusters has not yielded expected results. Most technology parks do not 
adequately address the infrastructure and ecosystem requirements of potential tenants.203
Efforts for stimulating commercialization of research results and creation of innovative 
businesses in universities, as postulated by Federal Law 217 are hampered by weak 
links between universities and research organizations, where innovation is supposed to 
be taking place, and business customers that generate demand for innovation. A lack 
of understanding of market needs and innovation commercialization strategies leaves 
isolated islands of innovation in the academic world that do not deliver broader value to the 
economy.
LOW INNOVATION DEMAND FROM S oEs
Innovation development programs for SoEs have not stimulated them to increase 
investments in innovations, and enterprises have not leveraged innovation to implement 
structural changes. The 2016 National Report of Innovations in Russia by the RVC 
discussed in length the experiences and opportunities for supporting innovation within 
large corporations in Russia, noting that state efforts so far have had very limited impact 
in increasing their R&D investments and innovativeness. The RVC sees opportunities for 
innovation especially in the oil and gas, automotive, aircraft and agriculture sectors, but 
lack of competition, high entry barriers, and low innovativeness within value chains remain 
obstacles.204
Given the high degree of consolidation in the Russian economy where SoEs account for a 
large share of the economy, enterprises do not feel the competitive pressure to invest in 
innovation on par with global corporate leaders.

204 Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation, Open Government, and RVC. 2016.GLOBAL BEST PRACTICE FOR BOOSTING DIGITAL INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN RUSSIA  114
A high degree of verticalization in the management structure of those enterprises, a 
traditional centralized top-down approach to decision making and risk aversion inherent in 
traditional corporate cultures, especially in SoEs, stifles innovation internally and makes it 
difficult for smaller, often more innovative solution vendors to win tenders and build long-term 
relationships with large players. Thus, the largest contributors to GDP growth do not create 
the demand for innovative solutions.
UNPREDICTABILITY OF THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
Russian incubators and accelerators have difficulties in attracting private investors and have 
fewer private partners than incubators and accelerators in developed markets. This is largely 
due to weaknesses in the Russian business climate and what investors refer to as a high level 
of market unpredictability driven by local and geopolitical factors that heighten the perceived 
risks of investment in local ventures.
INVESTORS ARE CAUTIOUS
According to the RVC Annual Report,205 the Russian venture market has in recent years been 
characterized by a growing caution of investors, who are moving away from early-stage 
investing to more mature companies, as well as a diversification of investment portfolios in 
favor of an increase in the number of transactions and a decrease in the average volume of 
investments (Figure 6.8). The most significant sector of investment was ICT which altogether 
accounted for 90 percent of the transaction volume.
The growth of the VC market is hindered by a lack of exits for VCs in Russia and a modest 
international interest in the country’s markets.206 After a continuous decline since 2013, 
the market demonstrated 8 percent growth in venture funds capital at the end of 2017 and 
reached US$4 billion. The total number of venture funds grew by 10 percent and amounted 
to 194 funds.207 The number of exits in 2017 was quite limited because of the decrease of 
investments in 2013–2014. Russian Venture Capital Association (RVCA) reported 20 exits 
worth a total of US$52 million.208
The significant capital outflow since 2013 had a major impact on investors’ strategies, making 
them invest more cautiously, with smaller investments in more mature stages. Thus, in 2012 
and 2013, the average transaction volume was US$2.7 and US$1.5 million, respectively. As of 
2014, it has decreased even further and fluctuates at the level of US$0.6–0.8 million.209
In 2017, the ICT sector remained the most preferred sector for investments at 58 percent of 
the total, followed by industrial technologies (22 percent) and biotechnology (7 percent). The 
same year, a total of US$125 million was invested in 178 companies, which is comparable to 
the figures for 2016 (US$125 million and 204 companies).210
In 2017, the state continued to play an active role, providing almost a third of the VC for the 
entire market and supporting 4 out of 22 newly opened venture funds. For start-ups outside 
the ICT sector, venture funds with state participation were the primary source of investments.
PUBLIC SUPPORT TOOLS NEED FURTHER REFINEMENT
Thus, there is no lack of public support for innovation and technology entrepreneurship in 
Russia, but there are signs that the existing instruments may not be designed or targeted

optimally, and there is a lack of alignment and coordination. There may have been too 
much focus on developing direct funding instruments, resulting in individual actors 
becoming too dependent on state funding and the public sector crowding out private 
finance. Horizontal connections are weak, as is a cooperation between key players, 
and flexible instruments and programs expected to address the lack of cooperation and 
encourage PPPs have not worked so far. 211
PRIVATE AND CORPORATE INVESTOR INTEREST IS LACKING
In 2017, there were 17 corporate venture funds with US$535 million of VC (13 percent of 
total VC market) and the total amount of VC investments into ICT projects reached just 
US$7 million.212 The number of deals closed by corporate venture funds has not exceeded 
5 per year for the last three years, accounting for 2 percent of overall venture deals in the 
market. The global share, by contrast, is 17 percent and growing.
As explained earlier, the limited number of corporate venture funds is partly a result of low 
demand for new technologies and innovation from large corporations, especially SoEs. 
The appetite for launching corporate venture funds is also low, as large corporations are 
reluctant to invest in high-risk ventures.
INNOVATION IS HIGHLY CONCENTRATED IN URBAN AREAS  
WITH MOSCOW IN THE LEAD
According to a report from the Martin Prosperity Institute, VC investment across the world 
amounted to US$42 billion in 2012 but was quite concentrated. The top 10 metros account 
for approximately 52 percent, the top 20 metros account for almost two-thirds, and the 
top 50 for more than 90 percent of the total global venture investment. Ultimately, global 
venture investment is highly uneven and spiky—concentrated in a small number of large 
cities and metros around the world, and the same is true for Russia.

Russian venture financing is centered largely in Moscow, where all major venture funds and 
most active accelerator programs, such as the accelerator of IIDF, GenerationS, GVA Launch 
Gurus, Skolkovo accelerator, VC Club, and private venture funds, are based. In 2017, 52 
percent in investment volume and 79 percent of all deals were closed in the Central Federal 
District, which is in line with the global trend. In Europe, for example, London is first with 
US$842 million or 14.8 percent of the European total, followed by Paris (US$449 million, 
7.9 percent), and Moscow (US$318 million, 5.6 percent). Together, these three metro areas 
make up more than a quarter (28 percent) of the total European venture capital.213 While 
VC investment in the Moscow area is adequate by international standards (Figure 6.9), 
investment in the rest of the country has slowed down. A weak start-up ecosystem produced 
very few exits in recent years, thus forcing many start-ups to look for opportunities in foreign 
markets.
ANGELS ARE FEW
The market for angel investments in Russia is still emerging, fragmented, segmented, and 
opaque, and reliable data is hard to come by. According to the Russian Angel Monitor,214 
in 2016, there were just 92 transactions registered and official sources recognize only 
25 individuals as serial business angels. In reality, both the numbers of business angels 
and transactions are likely to be greater. As with VC, angel investment activities are 
concentrated in Moscow. Angel investors cite Russian law and the inconvenience of 
conducting transactions as an obstacle. The legal status and regulations of crowdfunding 
are not clear in Russia, an issue that is currently being addressed.215

DIGITAL SKILLS ARE LACKING
In 2016, Russia ranked a relatively high 28th (out of 130 countries) in the WEF Index of 
Human Capital. Russia’s strengths are in the level of education in different age groups and 
in participation in higher education among those ages 15–24 (14th place). On the other hand, 
according to a WEF survey of business managers of the educational system’s compliance 
with the tasks of ensuring the competitiveness of the economy, Russia occupies 69th 
place out of 138 countries (3.7 on a seven-point scale). The leaders for this indicator are 
Switzerland, Singapore, and Finland.216 In the PISA in reading, mathematics, and science, 
Russia occupies 26th place out of 71, with an index value of 491.8, well behind the leaders, 
Singapore and Hong Kong SAR, China.217 In an assessment of the quality of science 
education, Russia stands below the OECD average while in math it is slightly above it, 
having shown significant improvement in the last six years. These rankings may surprise 
those who frequently point to Russia’s historical strength in the sciences.

CROWDFUNDING IN RUSSIA
In the last 5 years, over US$16 million was raised through the largest Russian crowdfunding platforms. While the 
average amount spent on supporting one project in 2012–2013 was US$8–9, in 2016–2017, it grew to US$24.a The 
largest crowdfunding platforms—Planeta.ru with over 700 thousand younger users interested in creative and charity

POLICY RESPONSES TO DIGITAL SKILLS DEVELOPMENT
Most policy responses to the skills shortage in the 
digital economy have focused on science, technol-
ogy, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education 
and hard technical skills. A Talent for Europe Report 
takes a more holistic view, making the following policy 
recommendations: 
 ●Continuous national and local skills diagnostics of 
supply and demand of high-tech talent, benchmark -
ing policies, best practices sharing, and improving of 
measurement and forecasting methodologies”
 ●The establishment of agile, just-in-time “software 
universities” and industry-relevant digital talent 
development ●A platform-based ecosystem of digital services for 
skills self-assessment using existing tools such as 
the European Classification of Skills/Competencies 
(ESCO) and the European e-Competence Framework 
(e-CF)
 ●Government use of incentives for lifelong learn-
ing and tools such as pre-commercial procurement 
of innovation, to position the state as an effective 
supporter of long-term innovation 
 ●Launch joint training programs in partnership with 
the industry and academia for leadership skills 
education to create a pool of high-tech and innova-
tion leaders, such as those at CERN and AirbusGLOBAL BEST PRACTICE FOR BOOSTING DIGITAL INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN RUSSIA  118
A recent report from McKinsey on digital skills in Russia.218 reinforces this point. Even though 
Lomonosov Moscow State University and the St. Petersburg National Research University 
of information technologies, mechanics, and optics (ITMO) are ranked among the 100 best 
universities of the world in computer science, and Russian teams perform well in math and 
natural science Olympics, overall the Russian education system is not producing enough 
skilled personnel for the digital economy. As a result, Russia lags behind the leading countries 
in terms of employment in high-tech and knowledge-intensive industries.
As elsewhere, the future of work in Russia will be affected by global trends in automation, 
robotization, and AI. Apart from eliminating certain types of jobs, these technologies will also 
enable policy makers to address certain Russia-specific challenges, such as its vast territory 
and regional disparities. Already second-tier cities, for example, Omsk, have started to lead 
in providing services over digital platforms. New digital-driven initiatives are appearing in 
many regions of Russia, for example, Kaluga and Ulyanovsk. Broadband connectivity and 
the gig economy will create new opportunities for talent in small cities and remote areas of 
the country, potentially slowing down the pace of urbanization and breathing new life into 
small towns and rural areas. Policy makers should proactively adopt regulation to manage 
gig economy labor issues such as worker protection, arbitration, dispute resolution, income 
security measures, and so on. A broad program of retraining and reskilling with a focus on both 
technical and soft skills is also a must.
The Agency of Strategic Initiatives (ASI) names several barriers for the development of new 
skilled labor for the digital economy:
 ●The Russian education system does not recognize the needs of organizations as future 
employers. Current internships and apprenticeships do not create young professionals with 
necessary skills and experience.
 ●The education system is not flexible and does not allow fast adoption of new standards and 
methods. The standard implementation cycle usually takes up to seven years.
 ●The lack of cooperation between enterprises and educational institutions leads to a limited 
number of joint trainings and educational programs.
 ●Most colleges and universities do not have the latest technologies and equipment.219
To overcome the gap, the ASI and other government institutions and universities launched 
several programs such as WorldSkills Hi-Tech, AgroSkills, and DigitalSkills championships, 
and NTI Olympics for high school students. Moreover, the agency published the atlas of new 
professions and leads the establishment of University 20.35.
Lifelong learning, flexibility of educational trajectories, modularity of educational courses, 
interpersonal skills, and “interdisciplinary” problem-solving are key to success in the digital 
age.

University 20.35 is a new education format, providing “networked” tailored personalized education by offering the 
best courses from a variety of educational institutions on a single platform. A digital competencies profile will replace a 
diploma. Education will be targeted at business owners, C-level managers, marketing managers, and researchers. The 
first educational track will be launched in July 2018 in the Far Eastern Federal University for 1,000 students in six areas. 
The budget for 2017–2018 exceeds US$26 million.119 COMPETING IN THE DIGITAL AGE: RUSSIA DIGITAL ECONOMY REPORT
Skills and education development is a major part of the Russian Digital Economy Program that 
aims for 40 percent of the population to possess digital skills by 2024.220
The importance of a broad skill set has been highlighted by a recent investor survey221 that 
identified the key challenges facing Russian start-ups: three out of four mentioned the lack of a 
coherent business model, almost 70 percent pointed to team weaknesses, and more than half 
identified a narrow market orientation. By far the majority of entrepreneurs have an engineer-
ing background and thus lack marketing and business skills to commercialize their offerings.
ESTABLISHING GOVERNMENT-LED REGIONAL INNOVATION CENTERS
Another way of facilitating innovation and fostering digital entrepreneurship at the regional 
level is to establish a network of government-led regional innovation centers by encouraging

DIGITAL SKILLS IN THE TULA OBLAST
A modern training and education cluster based on a partnership between schools, universities, professional training 
centers, government organizations, and large enterprises has been created in the Tula Oblast. The parties have signed 
an agreement to enhance the quality of physics and math training in the region. The regional government, the leading 
Rostech corporation, and the WorldSkills Russia development agency have agreed to launch the first higher technical 
school in the country at the local Oktava plant to train highly qualified specialists that are most in demand.
The regional government has also initiated the Composite Valley Project aimed at the creation of an industrial 
innovation cluster in the region at the Tula State University in partnership with the Lomonosov Moscow State University 
and other leading national universities. Students will also be offered opportunities to apply their knowledge at the 
Uzlovaya special economic zone.a

DRIVING REGIONAL INNOVATION IN KOREA
The Korean government is establishing Centers for Creative Economy and Innovation (CCEIs) across the country to 
drive focused regional innovation through PPPs. Each region of Korea has been assigned with developing a distinct 
set of competencies; for example, Seoul focuses on SME exports and cooperation with China. Kyonggi region drives 
FinTech, gaming, and IoT, while Sejong region focuses on agribusiness and smart agriculture. Regional specialization 
has been at the heart of the government’s national competitiveness vision.
The centers focus on establishing regional innovation ecosystems. As of July 2015, 18 centers have been established. 
They act as start-up hubs that promote SME innovation and drive new business creation and new job opportunities. 
Anyone with creative ideas can visit CCEIs and receive one-stop support including product development, financing, 
legal and technology support, marketing, and business development. The centers encourage collaboration with 
innovation agencies, universities, and companies to support regional flagship industries and match start-ups with new 
graduates in the regions. As of late 2016, CCEIs have supported 3,870 start-ups.GLOBAL BEST PRACTICE FOR BOOSTING DIGITAL INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN RUSSIA  120
large SoEs to work closely with individual entrepreneurs and university-housed research 
institutions with appropriate stimulation mechanisms; large corporations can play a significant 
role in building digital entrepreneurship ecosystems. These centers in close collaboration 
with academic institutions could also provide tailored education for business owners. A similar 
model based on private-public sector partnership has been rolled out in Korea (Box 6.10).
6.3 Policy Recommendations
To boost the Russian entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystem, first of all, it is critical 
to continue to improve the local business climate and launch specific initiatives aimed at 
building private sector and investor confidence in the transparency, stability, and predictability 
of the local market dynamics.
 ●Review existing regulation and public programs and policies governing entrepreneur-
ship and innovation in Russia and ensure its international competitiveness compared to 
the world’s leading centers of innovation, so as to make it attractive for local start-ups to 
grow locally rather than relocate abroad, and to support domestic and attract international 
investment.
Second, it is crucial to strengthen the innovation ecosystem by launching specific initiatives 
to boost links between the government, the private sector, and the scientific community. 
Specific initiatives include the following:
 ●Prioritize digital entrepreneurship in implementing the Russia Digital Economy Program. 
Develop a coordinated vision and road map for ecosystem enhancement through engag-
ing a wide array of start-up ecosystem stakeholders and by drawing on an accurate analy-
sis of the state of innovation and entrepreneurship in Russia.
 ●Improve horizontal links between different sectors, especially through creating cross-
sector innovation-oriented teams tasked with interpreting the value of new technologies 
for different verticals of the economy.
 ●Encourage universities, research institutions, and the scientific community to work closely 
with the private sector to understand market needs. Engage marketing and sales experts 
as active ecosystem participants to link products and solutions to private sector demand 
by driving commercialization and go-to-market strategies.
 ●Develop mechanisms to attract professional mediators, independent financial consultants, 
and financial and technological brokers to support investors in different deal stages.
Third, it is necessary to review the role of the public sector in start-up ecosystem develop-
ment and facilitation. Assess the effectiveness of government involvement in start-up support 
and funding to understand which support mechanisms are the most effective and which are 
less so. A system of regular assessment of existing support tools in line with innovation objec-
tives and key performance indicators (KPIs) and an agile mechanism of funds reallocation is 
key to the distribution of government support. A variety of support mechanisms should be 
continuously explored, including the role of government in crowding in private funding and 
targeted support to address market failures.
Fourth, coordination across government agencies and government programs needs 
improvement. Today there is a lack of a coordinated approach to the management of 
innovation policy instruments across sectors, and existing policies governing industry, science 
and technology, and education innovation development lack alignment. Several initiatives 
exist in Russia for improving the targeting of public funding, strengthening horizontal and 
cross-sectoral cooperation, and supporting joint projects between research institutes, 
universities, and companies. Most of the initiatives operate based on short-term time frames, 
when longer-term commitments are needed. Rather than launching new funding instruments 
and programs, it is recommended to focus on coordinating and improving existing ones 121 COMPETING IN THE DIGITAL AGE: RUSSIA DIGITAL ECONOMY REPORT
through feedback and evaluation. Special attention should be given to investigating barriers 
for cooperation, such as Intellectual Property in Russia (IPR) legislation, poor capability to 
manage IPR in joint projects, or regulatory obstacles. The national strategy of venture market 
development must be updated to reflect the priorities of the digital economy.
Fifth, it is necessary to accelerate the digital transformation initiatives of large SoEs to 
create demand for innovation locally and encourage them to increase open innovation 
activities through corporate accelerators and venture funds. SoEs have resources that can 
significantly benefit the start-up ecosystem, but they also need to be able to work through 
modern, agile models of cooperation. Special targeted and regularly reviewed tax benefits or 
co-investments could be used by the government as incentives. Qualitative innovation KPIs at 
SoEs should also be enforced.
Sixth, establish links with the global and regional entrepreneurial ecosystem.
 ●Develop partnerships with key players in the global VC market and attract experienced 
venture fund managers who can mentor investors. Setting up an ongoing training program 
for venture investors and specifically for corporate venture funds management is also 
recommended.
 ●Strengthen the Russian start-up community by engaging internationally experienced 
Russian entrepreneurs as mentors and champions.
 ●Leverage existing relationships beyond Moscow to support regional start-up communities. 
Build dedicated incentives to attract Russian scientists and entrepreneurs back to Russia. 
Engaging the Russian community abroad can help network and grow the Russian start-up 
ecosystem globally.
 ●Consider setting up regional innovation centers to encourage regional collaboration 
between innovation agencies, universities, and companies to support regional flagship 
industries and start-ups.
Seventh, develop and promote a culture of innovation.
 ●Review and analyze international best practice to select mechanisms for promoting a 
culture of open innovation that can work well in the Russian environment.
 ●Create innovation sandboxes for start-ups to implement new and promising innovations 
without fear of whether they meet legal or regulatory guidelines. Establish reasonable 
safeguards to limit the consequences of failure and maintain the stability of the technol-
ogy-enabled systems.
 ●Develop public relations strategies to improve the perception of entrepreneurs and the 
value of innovation in the eyes of the Russian public. Promote innovation success stories, 
encourage innovation evangelists, and promote high-profile successful entrepreneurs.
Last but not least, develop and nurture innovation talent at all stages of the education 
process.
 ●Develop digital education skill-set requirements appropriate for different educational 
levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary.
 ●Engage the private sector in formulating requirements for digital innovation and establish 
joint education programs with the private sector.
 ●Improve education for digital entrepreneurship at universities through multidisciplinary 
programs and through collaborative efforts between business and academia.
 ●Pay special attention to the growing needs of digital economy start-ups to employ talent 
from sectors beyond science and technology, such as business, design, and marketing as 
well as soft interpersonal skills.
 ●Develop multidisciplinary learning modules for use by incubators and accelerators in their 
training programs.GLOBAL BEST PRACTICE FOR BOOSTING DIGITAL INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN RUSSIA  122

CONCLUSION  126
CONCLUSION
There are several overarching takeaways from this study. Consistently and continuously 
addressing these five areas is fundamental to the success of the digital transformation 
process. These apply at the national, regional and municipal levels of the country, as well as 
at the sectoral level.
First of all, to prepare for digital disruption and to uncover opportunities for digital 
creation, policy makers around the world and in Russia need to strengthen the non-
digital foundations of their economies by maintaining leadership focus on the role of 
digital transformation in achieving national performance objectives; ensure agility in 
revising regulation to address the rapidly changing needs of the new digital economy; and 
empower an ecosystem of decision makers, institutions, and organizations responsible for 
stimulating digital transformation and managing digital disruption.
Effective project management is also of the essence. Detailed road maps need to be 
developed and implemented in line with key strategy objectives, project portfolios 
prioritized to identify quick wins as well as longer-term strategic initiatives. New governance 
mechanisms that engage all the key stakeholders in the decision-making and governance 
process should be introduced to accelerate the pace of transformation in line with stated 
goals. Budgets and financing mechanisms need to be firmly in place.
The dividends of building a competitive digital economy are high, and a high-level 
leadership focus on tightly targeted policies and flawless execution is required to 
accelerate the pace of this transformation.
Second, the government needs to continue to strengthen the digital foundations 
by preemptively investing into a scalable intelligent secure infrastructure capable of 
anticipating the exploding demand for the digital economy.
Third, it is about strengthening the digital transformation ecosystem both horizontally—
across all sectors of the economy at the national, regional, and municipal levels—as well as 
vertically, throughout the sectors and subsectors of government, industry, and services.
Weak links between the government, private sector, research organizations, and academic 
institutions negatively affect the pace of digital transformation, the implementation of 
key government programs, the adoption of new technologies and business models, 
proactive responses to technological and economic disruptions and crises, and the speed 
of innovation. A strong and effective operational ecosystem is the foundation of the 
technological breakthrough envisioned by the Russian leadership.
Fourth, it is about boosting digital skills, as any technological breakthrough requires a 
highly-trained workforce. In spite of its traditional strength in fundamental science, the 
Russian education system is not sufficiently agile to respond to the digital transformation 
requirements in all economic spheres. Strengthening the training and education ecosystem, 
starting at the level of kindergarten and all the way up to higher education, including 
coordination between enterprises and educational institutions in higher education and R&D 
is a must. So are investments into educational platforms for the rapid development of digital 
economy skills across the country, and training and upskilling the existing workforce with 
a focus on learner-centric lifelong educational models. Policy makers should also focus on 
reversing brain drain and attracting and retaining talent, as well as attracting the best and 
brightest back into the country.127 COMPETING IN THE DIGITAL AGE: RUSSIA DIGITAL ECONOMY REPORT
And finally, it is about cultural transformation. As digital transformation breaks down 
barriers between sectors, regions, organizations, and individuals, it challenges traditional 
centralized hierarchical governance structures and requires a new culture of ongoing 
innovation. Key elements of this culture include open communication and knowledge 
sharing, horizontal cross-team collaboration and co-creation, proactive experimentation 
and problem solving, risk taking, and the ability to translate failure into opportunity. Specific 
initiatives aimed at promoting a culture of open innovation should become a priority for 
Russian policy makers.
In terms of priorities, first, it is key to maintain the high-level government focus and 
strategic prioritization of the national digital transformation so as not to lose the existing 
momentum and concentrate on addressing the objectives outlined in the May 2018 
Presidential Decree and effectively reaching the 2025 goals set out in the Russia Digital 
Economy Program, the EAEU Digital Agenda, and other relevant policy documents.
Second, there is a need to accelerate the pace of the digital transformation of the 
traditional-industry sector where the application of ICT and new digital technologies 
can yield significant dividends across all parts of the value chain, thus improving 
the competitiveness of key industry sectors. Engaging the private sector in digital 
transformation partnerships, sharing best practice from the national leaders in this space, 
fostering connections with the scientific and R&D community, and creating favorable 
taxation regulation to incentivize investments into digital technologies and R&D are all 
mechanisms that need to be leveraged. Current industrial policy should be closely aligned 
with the digital economy policies and programs. It is also critical to invest in back-end digital 
transformation and organizational restructuring in private sector companies and especially 
the large SoEs.
Third, boosting R&D into new technologies and understanding their potential to transform 
traditional industries and create new ones should be high on the government and private 
sector agendas. Understanding the impact of emerging technologies on existing business 
models is key to gaining competitive advantage. A high level of coordination is required 
between industrial development objectives and digital transformation goals, so it can 
accelerate the creation of clusters of innovative companies and new drivers of economic 
growth.
Fourth, specific policies should be implemented to encourage innovation and 
entrepreneurship in the digital transformation context. Sustainable innovation requires 
close coordination between the government, the private sector, and the academic 
community. Public sector should not only support fundamental research and drive the 
development of world class R&D units in Russia but also implement policies to encourage 
the commercialization of R&D outputs, while the private sector should focus on go-to-
market strategies and new business-model development. An efficient regulatory system 
encouraging innovation should be further developed, with a special focus on intellectual 
property rights protection and patent regulation.
Fifth, the government needs to focus on ways to leverage digital technologies to alleviate 
disparities in the development of Russia’s regions and municipalities  and to enable 
the less-advanced regions to take advantage and effectively localize the implementation 
of the national digital economy program. Policies should focus on demand creation by 
large regional SoEs, local digital skills development, management training, local PPPs, and 
regional innovation cluster-building, local market development and funding mechanisms. 
Special attention should be given to developing digital infrastructure in remote and rural 
areas and educating rural populations about the benefits of digital services.
And finally, policies should be aimed at the development of a receptive domestic 
market that values the processes and outputs of digital transformation . These include 
a focused top-down approach to the digital transformation of large industrial enterprises 
and especially SoEs where technology adoption can be managed throughout the existing CONCLUSION  128
strong vertically integrated industry structures to boost demand for digital technologies, 
as well as specific steps aimed at improving the business climate, focused market-
development initiatives to boost local demand, public sector technology procurement 
preferences, and incentives for market players to procure locally. Initiatives aimed at 
building the public’s trust in the digital economy are also important.
In summary, the ongoing Russian government commitment to digital transformation as a 
national priority, if complemented by effective policies across key economic sectors and 
a results-oriented focus on implementation, will enable the country to join the world’s 
digital transformation leaders and position it for a technological breakthrough and the 
achievement of the economic and social benefits it implies.129 COMPETING IN THE DIGITAL AGE: RUSSIA DIGITAL ECONOMY REPORT
