Abstract
Purpose –This paper aims to identify the dynamic capabilities of government organisations in Woredas of
Ethiopia that digitally innovate on the existing government digital platform, the WoredaNet.
Design/methodology/approach –The study adopted a qualitative interpretive case study strategy
using three government administrative regions in Ethiopia (called Woredas), which digitally innovateusing the government digital platform, the WoredaNet. A structured interview protocol was
implemented for data collection. In total, 5 respondents representing users, information and
communication technology (ICT) staff and management were selected from each of the Woredas(districts), yielding a total of 15 respondents.
Findings –Drawing from the dynamic capabilities literature, the ﬁndings reveal that the digital platform
governance model plays the strongest role in digital government innovation. Speci ﬁcally, the Woredas exhibit
highly developed adaptive capabilities through learning from the affordances offered by the digital platform.Also, despite the collaborative nature of their absorptive capabilities, there are no clear organisational
structures to manifest these capabilities (integrating new learnings). The innovative capabilities (creating
digital government products or service innovations) are constrained by the governance model, which iscentralised in one ICT unit.
Research limitations/implications –The research is limited to one of the Regional States of Ethiopia.
Further studies would be needed to consider other regional states and more Woredas.
Practical implications –The research provides a means through which dynamic capabilities can
improve digital innovation on government digital platforms, despite the scarcity of resources, especially inlow-income countries.
Originality/value –The paper contributes to digital government and dynamic capability literature in
revealing how digital innovations in government agencies might be organisationally enhanced throughdistributed digital platform governance models.

In the recent past, many low-income countries have improved their national information and
communication technology (ICT) infrastructure, especially concerning mobile technology
(Katz and Callorda, 2018 ). It has been shown that an improvement in ICT infrastructure,
mobile in particular, signi ﬁcantly improves the economies of low-income countries,
particularly in Africa (Esselaar et al., 2007 ;Aron and Muellbauer, 2019 ;Ejemeyovwi et al.,
2019). The assumption is that such infrastructure provides a platform for contextual
innovation (Taghavi et al., 2014 ;Armey and Hosman, 2016 ;Soni et al.,2 0 1 7 ;Sinha, 2018 ). In
terms of contextual innovation, it is important to note that what counts as an innovation inone context will differ from what counts in another. In particular, a digital innovation in a
low-income country might be regarded as common in a high-income country. Nonetheless,
the fundamental thesis of digital innovation remains the creation and activation of newproducts, services or organisational models using digital technology or the use of digitaltechnology in the creation process (Nambisan et al.,2 0 1 7 ;Hinings et al.,2 0 1 8 ;Susanty et al.,
2018).
It is, therefore, surprising that despite the infrastructural improvements in low-income
countries, the e-government development index (Stier, 2015 ;Daset al., 2017 ; Tokdemir et al.,
2017) remains consistently low, especially in Africa (Stier, 2015 ;Daset al.,2 0 1 7 ;Zhenmin,
2018;Mensah et al., 2020 ). The existence of a well-de ﬁned digital government platform does
not necessarily guarantee its usage nor innovation (Roengtam et al. , 2017 ;Toots, 2019 ).
Some of the challenges have been identi ﬁed as unstable internet access, digital illiteracy, a
digital divide amongst users and the use of the platform by people with disabilities. Other
limitations are unclear government strategies and policy guidelines and the cost to retainskilled personnel to guarantee the appropriate use of the platforms (Waller and Genius,
2015;Danneels et al.,2 0 1 7 ;Roengtam et al., 2017 ;Naranjo-zolotov et al.,2 0 1 9 ;Toots, 2019 ).
In this study, the attention is turned to beyond infrastructure to understand how
government organisations in low-income countries are being innovative on the existingdigital platforms within their resource constraints. Government digital platforms play asigniﬁcant role, such as consultation, decision-making, government-citizen collaboration,
voting and participatory policymaking
(Nugroho et al. ,2 0 1 5 ;Waller and Genius, 2015 ;
Albiman and Sulong, 2016 ;Naranjo-zolotov et al.,2 0 1 9 ).
The study drew on the dynamic capability theory from organisational theory, which
suggests that organisations need to rearrange their internal resources to take the advantage
of the increasingly dynamic environment (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000 ;Pisano, 2017 ;
Sabahi and Parast, 2019 ). The main objective of this study was, therefore, to identify the
dynamic capabilities of government organisations of low-income countries that digitallyinnovate using existing digital government platforms.
The choice of dynamic capabilities was twofold: ﬁrstly, the dynamic capability theory
shifts the focus from resources to resourcefulness, an important element for resource-constrained contexts; and secondly, the theory takes into account digital technology as animportant element of the innovative use of existing resources. The dynamic capability
theory has also been used to make sense of digital innovation in low-income countries
(Xiao
and Dasgupta, 2009 ;Sharma and Shanks, 2011 ;Owoseni and Twinomurinzi ,2018a, 2018b ).
However, there has been little to no research done on the dynamic capabilities that supportdigital government in low-income countries, especially in Africa (Senshaw and
Twinomurinzi, 2018 ).
Speciﬁcally, the study sought to understand the dynamic capabilities of Ethiopia ’s local
government administrative regions, known as Woredas and how they digitally innovate onthe existing digital government platform, the WoredaNet.Government
digital
platforms
813Ethiopia initiated the WoredaNet project as a digital platform in 2007, which saw a
massive rollout of ﬁbre and satellite installations across the entire country. The name
WoredaNet comes from “Woreda ”, which is Amharic for an administrative region with a
population of about 100,000. It has the equivalent meaning of a district. Ethiopia has the
second largest population in Africa with 112,078,730 people (Mettler, 2019 ) and is the 10th-
largest country in Africa with 1,104,300 km2. As much of the central and northern part of
Ethiopia is covered by a rugged mass of mountains, the WoredaNet in such areas isprimarily through satellite installations. Of the 1,050 Woredas, 976 (93%) have access to the
WoredaNet. Yet, despite the signi ﬁcant investments, only a few of the Woredas digitally
innovate government services using the digital government platform (Miruts and Asfaw,
2014).
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: The next section presents the
literature review of digital platforms, digital government and dynamic capabilities theory.This is followed by a description of the WoredaNet digital platform and materials and
method. The next section presents data analysis and results followed by a discussion of
ﬁndings. Finally, the conclusion, limitations and further research areas are highlighted.
2. Literature review
2.1 Digital platforms
The notion of digital platforms is emergent and often de ﬁned dependent on the context
(Constantinides et al.,2 0 1 8 ;Pereira et al., 2018 ). In this study, digital platforms are de ﬁned as
the technological systems that facilitate online citizen engagement as part of a co-creation
process (Constantinides et al. ,2 0 1 8 ;Ezeet al. , 2020 ). Digital platforms are socio-technical
systems that bring data, services, technologies and people together to take action to change
societal interests (Berto et al.,2 0 1 6 ;Gawer, 2020 ).
Digital platforms differ mainly in their market capitalisation, the sector they are involved
in and their governance models (Koskinen et al.,2 0 1 8 ). The governance model dictates who
makes what decisions about a platform. The sector in ﬂuences the way the platform is
shaped and how it runs. The ownership structure in ﬂuences the ﬁnancial structure and
whether the platform should target pro ﬁt-making or welfare maximisation.
Digital platforms are attractive as an organising model as they reduce transaction costs,
including distribution, search, contracting and monitoring costs (Waller and Genius, 2015 ;
Ariana et al.,2 0 2 0 ;Gawer, 2020 ). For instance, aggregation platforms such as TripAdvisor
and Expedia collect travel information from several sources into one platform, therebyreducing the cost of searching for information. Digital platforms also provide a technical
development environment (Parker et al.,2 0 1 6 ;Salge, 2017 ;Reuver et al.,2 0 1 8 ).
Other additional attributes of digital platforms are their generativity (Sedera et al.,2 0 1 6 ;
Reuver et al. ,2 0 1 8 ) and cross-side network effects (Janowski, 2015 ;Kenney et al. ,2 0 1 9 ).
Generativity is the capacity of a platform to create new outcomes motivated by large and
heterogeneous users (Fielt and Gregor, 2016 ;Hein et al.,2 0 1 9 ). For instance, the generativity
of crowdsourcing helps to create new ways to solve challenging problems using
contributions from a large number of participants. Cross-side network effects demonstratehow the value for a participant on one side increases if the number of participants on the
other side increases. For instance, in the case of eBay or Amazon, the value of the digital
platform for a seller increases when there are more buyers on the other side, and vice versa.
There are two other ways that digital platforms are discussed; as products and as
ecosystems. The product-oriented view is where digital platforms are physical products
produced by the engineering of architectural designs, where economies of scale andscope can be attained by the reuse of components
(Zahra and Nambisan, 2011 ;JSTPM
13,4
814Wareham et al. , 2014 ;Reuver et al. , 2018 ;Skog et al. , 2018 ). In terms of the ecosystem
view, platforms are seen as a system of business centres that control and coordinate
exchanges amongst organisations (Ghazawneh and Henfridsson, 2013 ;Parker et al. ,
2016 ;Reuver et al. , 2018 ;Sako, 2018 ). This paper takes an ecosystem view, where the
government provides a digital platform that enables different government departments
to coordinate exchanges with each other and other stakeholders.
2.2 Digital governmentDigital government is a government digital innovation solution to societal, economic andother pressures
(Janowski, 2015 ;Panori et al. , 2020 ;Pérez-Morote et al. ,2 0 2 0 ). The digital
innovation of government services is an essential element in a wider social innovation
ecosystem. In this regard, governments are the key actors for creating these ecosystems,acting through policies that encourage innovation for economic, social and culturaldevelopment (Sorn-in et al. , 2014 ;Nugroho et al. ,2 0 1 5 ;Choi and Chandler, 2020 ). Digital
government can be used by a legislative, executive and interpretive body of a government to
improve the effectiveness and ef ﬁciency of public service delivery (Janowski, 2015 ;Mainka
et al.,2 0 1 5 ;Janssen and Van der Voort, 2016 ;Pérez-Morote et al.,2 0 2 0 ).
Digital government is expected to improve public sector performance by reducing
expenditure, improving revenue and minimising transaction costs (Siddiquee, 2008 ;Irani
and Kamal, 2016 ;Mawela et al.,2 0 1 7 ;Mensah et al., 2020 ). It is seen as a means to improve
the performance of government and public administration and as a prerequisite foreconomic and social development. Social and economic development is more relevant for
low-income countries where public administration is often characterised by inef ﬁciency,
limited capacity and poorly trained personnel (Schuppan, 2009 ;Janowski, 2015 ;Abu-shanab
and Shehabat, 2018 ;Twizeyimana and Andersson, 2019 ).
It is important to take into account the institutional, cultural and administrative contexts
of low-income countries to implement digital government successfully (Twizeyimana and
Andersson, 2019 ;Gil-Garcia and Flores-Zúñiga, 2020 ). Because of the different
administrative characteristics and cultures in low-income countries, a mere transfer ofdigital government concepts does not work (Chatterjee and Kar, 2017 ). This is because there
is an inherent danger that the solutions may be merely implemented in existing
organisational structures and even abused by bureaucratic elites for their interests. Theresult could be corruption, centralism, hierarchy and inef ﬁciency in government services. In
other words, a context-oriented approach is a more promising strategy to implement digital
government successfully in low-income countries (Abu-shanab and Shehabat, 2018 ;Visvizi
et al.,2 0 1 8 ;Twizeyimana and Andersson, 2019 ).
The failure of digital government in low-income countries is attributed mainly to culture,
the widening digital divide, computer illiteracy, inadequate infrastructure and a lack ofskills and competencies for design, implementation, use and management of digital
government systems
(Schuppan, 2009 ;Abu-shanab and Shehabat, 2018 ;Twizeyimana and
Andersson, 2019 ). Moreover, digital innovation in resource-constrained governments
requires more investment in non-infrastructure capabilities (Schuppan, 2009 ;Janowski,
2015;Abu-shanab and Shehabat, 2018 ;Twizeyimana and Andersson, 2019 ). It is from this
need to innovate using any available internal resources within constraints and within thecontext that the study drew on the theory of dynamic capabilities.
2.3 Dynamic capability theory
Dynamic capabilities are the capabilities of an organisation to recon ﬁgure and recombine its
internal resources to improve organisational performance (Collis, 1994 ;Hristov, 2017 ;Government
digital
platforms
815Augier and Teece, 2018 ;Chong et al.,2 0 1 8 ). The dynamic capability framework emphasises
the appropriate and discerning use of available organisational resources, physical and non-
physical, towards attaining an organisational goal in unpredictable and dynamicenvironments (Chong et al.,2 0 1 8 ;Kankanhalli et al., 2019 ).
Dynamic capabilities enable an organisation to innovatively realise plans and strategies
to enhance its effectiveness and ef ﬁciency (Kankanhalli et al. , 2017 ;Nason and Wiklund,
2018). The most important concern in the dynamic capability theory is the utilisation of
existing and available internal resources rather than the acquisition of more resources(Lawson and Samson, 2001 ;Hossan Chowdhury and Quaddus, 2021 ). Dynamic capabilities
help to investigate not only the non-infrastructural resources that are required but also how
the internal resources are continually restructured and reused for organisational
effectiveness and ef ﬁciency (Wang and Ahmed, 2007 ;Chong et al.,2 0 1 8 ;Kankanhalli et al.,
2019). Dynamic capabilities re ﬂect the ability to also recognise the changing external
environment and reinvent existing routines (Huet al. ,2 0 1 2 ;Janssen and Van der Voort,
2016;Chong et al. ,2 0 1 8 ). Dynamic capabilities can result in greater social and economic
progress in low-income countries as they enable them to use their limited resources wisely(Mohammed et al., 2016 ;Irani and Kamal, 2016 ;Siddiquee, 2008 ).Wang and Ahmed (2007)
identify the three overarching aspects of dynamic capabilities as adaptive, absorptive and
innovative capabilities.
2.3.1 Adaptive capability. Adaptive capabilities are the capabilities of an organisation to
scan the external environment to identify relevant opportunities and threats. These
capabilities are used to determine continuously the opportunities from the environment,
which will lead to ideas and strategies that enable the organisation to adapt to the dynamicenvironment
(Teece, 2007 ;Kelly et al. , 2020 ;Shen et al. ,2 0 2 0 ). From a government
perspective, scanning the environment would include examining the needs and the usage of
ICT by other government agencies, businesses and citizens (Bataineh and Abu-Shanab,
2016). Therefore, this study sought to answer the following sub-question:
SQ1. How do government organisations in Woredas that digitally innovate using the
WoredaNet manifest their adaptive capabilities?
2.3.2 Absorptive capability. Absorptive capabilities are the capabilities of an organisation to
recognise the signi ﬁcance of external opportunities, assimilate the value of the opportunity
and apply it for the bene ﬁt of the organisation (Breznik and Lahovnik, 2016 ;Howell, 2020 ).
Ideas from external opportunities can be evaluated based on previous experience, expertise
and capabilities. These capabilities enable an organisation to learn from the external
environment in the process of creating organisation-embedded knowledge (Teece et al.,1 9 9 7 ;
Dzhengiz and Niesten, 2020 ). From the government perspective, absorptive capabilities
would include undertaking collaborative-based research and development activities that can
evaluate externally obtained opportunities for effective use (Bitencourt et al. , 2019).
Therefore, the study sought to answer the following sub-question:
SQ2. How do government organisations in Woredas that digitally innovate using the
WoredaNet manifest their absorptive capabilities?
2.3.3 Innovative capability. The innovative capabilities of an organisation demonstrate the
ability of the organisation to create new services or novel ways of offering the existing
services (Story et al. , 2014 ;Breznik and Lahovnik, 2016 ;Lipovka et al. ,2 0 2 1 ). These
capabilities enable an organisation to create new organisational structures or forms that
beneﬁt from the surrounding dynamic environment. These organisational capabilities haveJSTPM
13,4
816the power to combine, introduce, modify and integrate resources so that the organisation can
beneﬁt from the dynamic environment (Teece, 2007 ). They provide an organisation with the
opportunity to select appropriate resources and carry out practical implementations withinnovative ideas to create new organisational forms (Breznik and Lahovnik, 2016 ;
Magnusson et al.,2 0 1 9 ). From the government perspective, the innovative capabilities would
include designing and developing better ICT infrastructure, as well as enhanced ICT policiesand strategies that can facilitate better digital government services (Lappi et al.,2 0 1 9 ). This
study, therefore, sought to answer the following sub-question:
SQ3. How do government organisations in Woredas that digitally innovate using the
WoredaNet manifest their innovative capabilities?
The WoredaNet, which Woredas are expected to innovate upon to deliver innovative
government services, is explained below as a digital platform.
3. The WoredaNet digital platform in Ethiopia
The WoredaNet is a government ICT infrastructure initiative in Ethiopia that is district-
based. The infrastructure includes broadband, terrestrial and satellite-based networksconnecting the lowest levels of government
(Hare, 2007 ;Lessa et al., 2011 ;Lessa et al.,2 0 1 5 ).
The WoredaNet serves as a digital platform upon which Woredas can provide ICT servicessuch as video conferencing, directory services, mail services and internet connectivity tofederal-, regional- and Woreda-level government agencies in the country (Lessa et al., 2011 ;
Madebo, 2019 ).
The WoredaNet is managed and administered by the former Ethiopian ICT Development
Agency, now called the Ministry of Science and Technology. Its responsibility is to deviserules and regulations on how Woredas use the WoredaNet. The WoredaNet uses a three-tierarchitecture, namely, the national data centre (NDC), regional data centre and Woreda datacentre
(Belachew, 2010 ). The NDC is considered the heart of the WoredaNet that centrally
provides all the services across the different regions and Woreda-level data centres. It isresponsible for managing, monitoring, supporting and coordinating activities of all regionaland Woreda data centres. It also provides maintenance and training support to the lowerlevel data centres.
There are 11 regional data centres located in the regional capital cities of Ethiopia. These
centres provide services to regional government departments and support to the Woredacentres in their corresponding regions
(Miruts and Asfaw, 2014 ). The Woreda data centres
are located in the main towns of each Woreda and provide services to the lowest levelgovernment agencies in the Woreda.
4. Materials and method
This research adopted a qualitative-interpretive research paradigm as this enabled the
researchers to investigate digital innovation in its natural setting (Dubé and Paré, 2003 ;Yin,
2005;Owoseni and Twinomurinzi, 2018b ). Qualitative-interpretivism provides a degree of
ﬂexibility to conduct an in-depth investigation into patterns (Thanh and Thanh, 2015 ),
giving signi ﬁcant attention to process, context, interpretation, meaning or understanding
using inductive reasoning (Eyisi, 2016 ). This method captures the in ﬂuences that actions
and experiences of respondents have on a phenomenon of interest without usingstandardised and predetermined response categories (Yilmaz, 2013 ;Eyisi, 2016 ).Government

8174.1 Role of the researcher
In qualitative research, it is necessary to recognise any researcher bias as it helps readers to
understand the perspectives that led to a research outcome (Owoseni and Twinomurinzi ,
2018a, 2018b ). The principal researcher in this study resides in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia and has
10 years of experience as a university graduate assistant, assistant lecturer and lecturer in acomputing faculty at a leading Ethiopian university.
4.2 Data collection
A case study research strategy was adopted, and a structured interview instrument was
used for data collection. Figure 1 shows the location of Ethiopia in Africa and the Amhara
Regional State in Ethiopia where the research was conducted.
4.3 Case design
There are 1,050 Woredas in Ethiopia, 976 of which (93%) have access to the WoredaNet. Six
Woredas were selected for the study; three Woredas that digitally innovate with theWoredaNet (the Amhara Regional State, Dangila town and Woreta town) and three that donot digitally innovate (Bahir Dar town, Bahir Dar Zuria district and Farta). The choice of theWoredas was by the ICT management of the Amhara Regional State Science, Technologyand Information Communication Commission. Due to length limitations, only the dynamiccapabilities of the three Woredas that digitally innovate with the WoredaNet are examinedin this paper. The path dependencies that inhibit digital innovation in the other threeWoredas are examined in a separate paper.
From each of the Woredas understudy, three ICT systems supporting three different
public agencies were selected; the judiciary system, human resources (HR) and the ﬁnance
system.
4.3.1 The sample
4.3.1.1 Judiciary (court) process. The court process is s upported by computer-based
information and database systems. This system hosts court activities such as cases, records,
proceedings, charges, verdicts and sentences at the federal, regional and Woreda levels. Videoconferencing technology is used to make online court services available. This technology isimportant mainly for geographically remote districts or locations where it is dif ﬁcult for
citizens with court cases to be available in person where the judge resides.

8184.3.1.2 Human resource management process. The HR management process uses video
conferencing technology to provide timely information and training for employees,especially in remote areas. This technology saves unnecessary time that may be lost movingfrom the workplace to the training centre and vice versa. This also reduces travel andadministrative costs that may be incurred for the training.
4.3.1.3 Finance management process. Finance management is an administrative process
where the WoredaNet infrastructure is used for allocating and distributing the budget forgovernment organisations at different levels such as federal, region and district. The processuses the Integrated Budget and Expenditure system for recording, processing and reportingﬁnancial information.
4.4 Interview selection
Three process owners (those who manage similar tasks or processes in the government
agency), one from each government agency, one ICT support and a district administrator (ora representative) from each of the three Woredas, were selected. This made up a total of 15interviewees.
4.5 Interview design
The interview questions were designed based on literature about eliciting adaptive,
absorptive and innovative capabilities
(Wang and Ahmed, 2007 ). Theoretical concepts such
as dynamic capability theory were operationalised into interview questions to measure thedynamic capabilities of the Woredas. The interview protocol is presented in
Appendix 1 .
4.6 Reliability and validity
The reliability and validity of qualitative research are expressed in terms of trustworthiness,
rigour and quality (Golafshani, 2003 ;Owoseni and Twinomurinzi ,2018a, 2018b ). The
quality of qualitative research depends on its credibility, dependability, con ﬁrmability,
transferability and authenticity (Connelly, 2016 ). Credibility refers to the con ﬁdence in the
truth of the study, and therefore, the ﬁndings of the study. For credibility, the researcher
conducted in-depth interviews using open-ended questions. This interview strategy enabledan understanding of the lived experiences of respondents. The interview protocol wasmanaged consistently for all interviews in similar situations. Dependability refers to thestability of the data over the period of the study. The researcher carried out the datacollection process in similar circumstances for all interviews. The interviews were audio-recorded, and ﬁeld notes were also taken during the interview process. Con ﬁrmability refers
to the degree to which the ﬁndings are consistent and could be repeated. For this study, the
recorded interviews were transcribed into text and presented back to the respondents toconﬁrm that what was transcribed was what they said. Atlas.ti8 was used to keep detailed
notes during the analysis process. Transferability is the extent to which ﬁndings are useful
to other settings. The research was conducted in three Woredas with similar socio-economicand political contexts. Authenticity refers to the extent to which researchers fairly andcompletely show a range of different realities and appropriate participants for the study.The sample Woredas were selected by the appropriate government organisation in theAmhara Regional State. The respondents further represented a cross-section of civilservants at different levels of management, users and ICT personnel.Government

8195. Data analysis and results
The interview data were transcribed and analysed using thematic content analysis methods
in Atlas.ti8.
5.1 Content analysis strategy
Thematic analysis is the process of identifying themes in qualitative data. The process of a
thematic analysis of unstructured data considers a sequence of steps (Braun and Clarke,
2012). An inductive approach was followed to elicit the codes and produce categories
(themes) from the content of the data (Appendices 2 –4 and Appendices 5 –7). Process coding
was adopted as it aligns with the interpretive nature of the study. Process coding enabled
the identi ﬁcation of action statements in words that end in “ing”as they frequently indicate
actions in data. Moreover, process coding helped to ﬁnd out continuous actions or
interactions engaged in response to problems (Cooper and Saldaña, 2009 ;Stuckey, 2015 ).
5.2 Results
This section presents the results of the analysis based on the research questions:
5.2.1 Adaptive capabilities. In total, 22 unique codes were elicited with a total count of 124
and 9 themes were elicited from the codes ( Table 1 ).
The themes suggest that Woredas scan their external environment using the WoredaNet
mainly through feedback of reports, as well as learning and growth programmes, using the
internet and social media, learning from experience sharing and analysing best practices of

adaptive capability codes:
We set experience sharing programmes with the neighbouring Woredas (districts) to identify new
ways of providing services. (Male, ﬁnance process owner)
We use social media and the internet to acquire knowledge on how to manage a court case
management system that records audio ﬁles and transcribes to other format types. (Male, Court
service process owner)
5.2.2 Absorptive capabilities. In total, 15 unique codes were elicited with a total count of 70
and7 themes were derived from the codes ( Table 2 ).
The themes suggest that the Woredas use the WoredaNet to absorb the new learnings
through self-driven efforts, mainly through online training. This is closely followed by
seeing what others do and creating partnerships with other Woredas or technical experts.Formal training and workshops are less preferred. A few quotes from the interviews
illustrate how some Woredas apply their absorptive capabilities:
We usually engage ourselves in online training to solve problems in administering WoredaNet
services. (Female, ICT support)
We conduct an expert discussion forum through multicast video conferencing to evaluate the
value of new technologies before the actual implementation. (Male, Human resource management
process owner)
5.2.3 Innovative capabilities. In total, 10 unique codes were elicited with a total count of 33
and 3 themes were elicited from the codes ( Table 3 ).
Regarding the Woredas using the WoredaNet to create new services, new solutions and/
or new ways of adopting, the themes suggest that they turn primarily to technical ICT. This

6. Discussion of ﬁndings
Theﬁndings suggest that government organisations in Woredas exhibit highly developed
adaptive capabilities through the WoredaNet digital platform. The Woredas comfortablyunderstand changes in their dynamic environment to identify any needed opportunities and
mitigate any threats. Similarly,
Owoseni and Twinomurinzi (2018a) in their work identi ﬁed
that small and medium enterprises in Lagos, Nigeria use feedback, social media andinternet-based technologies, amongst others to identify emerging market opportunities. Thecomparison holds, as the organisational elements such as resources, routines and
capabilities that permit improved performance are found with the same logic in both
government organisations and private ﬁrms(Pablo et al., 2007 ;Klein et al.,2 0 1 3 ;De Vries
et al.,2 0 1 6 ).
The attempt to translate and exploit these opportunities (the absorptive capability) is
mainly through self-driven efforts as provided in online learning and through partnerships
with Woredas and technical experts. Moreover, the absorptive capabilities of governmentorganisations (
Table 2 ) were related to learning the innovation of others. This could
demonstrate that learning the innovation of others instead of investing in innovation is
considered to be important to deploy dynamic capabilities in government organisations
(Pablo et al. , 2007 ;De Vries et al. ,2 0 1 6 ;Moussa et al. ,2 0 1 8 ). However, there are no clear
formal Woreda structures on how to exploit identi ﬁed opportunities. In large organisational
structures such as in government, self-driven efforts that are not part of an organisational
structure tend to become frustrated. This is an effect of path dependency whereorganisations continue in certain patterns even when those patterns are no longer useful.Other organisations exhibit their absorptive capabilities through organisational learning
where individual agents in the organisation use the structure of the organisation to gain
knowledge from the environment and then communicate amongst the members and

822subunits to incorporate the shared knowledge with the working procedures of the
organisation (Roberts et al.,2 0 1 2 ;Sharma and Singh, 2012 ).
As can be observed from Tables 1 and2of the results section, the same capability codes
overlap between different capabilities with different contexts. For instance, government
organisations in the Woredas visit ICT trade fairs and workshops as both adaptive andabsorptive capabilities. The context in which they use these capabilities varies. As anadaptive capability, they use these capabilities to scan the environment to use opportunitiesand manage threats. On the other hand, as an absorptive capability, they also use the same
capabilities to evaluate new information or ideas based on the knowledge obtained from the
visit. This demonstrates that dynamic capabilities are correlated but conceptuallydistinctive (Wang and Ahmed, 2007 ).
In terms of the ability to create new digital products and service innovations that take
advantage of the identi ﬁed opportunities (the innovative capabilities), government
organisations in Woredas turn entirely to technical ICT. Also, the underdeveloped
innovative capability, as seen in the number of codes and themes generated, re ﬂects a
dependence on an external competence that might not be readily available in the Woredas.
6.1 Implications for research, practice and policy
Theﬁndings have practical and policy implications particularly for resource constrained
countries such as Ethiopia as the main concern in the dynamic capability framework is theutilisation of existing and available limited resources wisely. In terms of practice, the
dynamic capability framework can guide policymakers and practitioners to better
understand key considerations in designing digital government platforms that can assistdigital innovation in a rapidly changing dynamic environment. The identi ﬁed capabilities
can also then be taught to other Woredas that are not actively using the platform. Moreover,theﬁndings have research implications and can serve as a basis for researchers to further
study the design and implementation of digital government in low-income countries from
the innovation perspective of dynamic capability theory.
Theﬁndings also re ﬂect the governance model of the WoredaNet platform, which is
managed by a central ICT unit. The central unit devises the rules and regulations on howWoredas use the WoredaNet. Such a governance model limits digital innovation at a locallevel. In many other organisations, there is a growing move to decentralise digital
innovation from a traditional central ICT department to within each department through the
use of more ICT-savvy business users rather than ICT technical experts
(Nambisan et al.,
2017;Gomez et al. ,2 0 1 8 ). The governance model re ﬂects further in the constrained
generativity and cross-side effects. The next section concludes with a re ﬂection on the above
ﬁndings and with recommendations for policy and practice.
7. Conclusion
The objective of the study was to identify, using qualitative-interpretive methods, thedynamic capabilities of government organisations in Woredas that digitally innovate usingthe existing government digital platform of Ethiopia, the WoredaNet.
The Woredas exhibited well-developed adaptive capabilities in being able to leverage the
digital platform to understand their environment and identify opportunities, but theorganisational structures to translate the opportunities into potential digital innovationswere not in place. The governance structures around the digital platforms remain traditional
and centralised to an ICT unit. This governance structure inhibits digital innovation.
The preference for self-learning and collaborative partnerships as a means to exploit
identi ﬁed opportunities and to integrate them into new learnings from the externalGovernment
digital
platforms
823environment is a strength that can be leveraged. However, the dependence on an external
innovative capability inhibits the possible digital innovations that are possible.
The research therefore, recommends that policy on the governance model of digital
government platforms should be reconsidered to allow for a more distributed model, whichemphasises greater collaboration with non-technical-savvy personnel supported bytechnical ICT. For practice, the study recommends that practical efforts should be made toincentivise the self-learning and collaborative approach. This research contributes to thedynamic capabilities and digital government theory by revealing how government agenciesin low-income countries, in this instance Ethiopia, might demonstrate stronger adaptivecapabilities but are constrained by the digital government platform models. This paper alsocontributes to government practice and policy by providing a means through whichdynamic capabilities can improve digital government services.
7.1 Limitations and future research
One limitation of the study was that it focussed on Woredas in the Amhara Regional States
of Ethiopia. Future research should consider increasing Woredas from different RegionalStates and different stakeholders across Woredas. Future research should also consider thepath dependencies of government agencies in the Woredas that do not actively use theWoredaNet digital government platform.
