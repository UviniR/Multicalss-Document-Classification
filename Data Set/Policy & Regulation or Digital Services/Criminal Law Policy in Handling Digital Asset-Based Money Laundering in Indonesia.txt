ABSTRACT  
 
The rapid development of information technology has given birth to a variety of 
services with a variety of digital information facilities, where the sophistication of 
information technology -based products is able to integrate all information media so as 
to make the world become borderless and cause significant social, cultural, economic 
and law enforcement changes take  place quickly.  Nevertheless, the conditions in 
Indonesia which are growing and developing towards an information technology -
based industrial society, in some cases are still lagging behind to follow the 
development of information technology. The concepts and theories used to analyze are 
Criminal Law Policy, Law Number 8 of 2010 concerning Money Laundering.  The 
paper emphasized that the development of information technology that is developing 
now, especially in the field of digital assets is able to become an opportunity for 
money laundering.  The paper highlighted that in the case of committing the crime of 
money laundering is carried out using the digital currency -based information 
technology method and can be used for cross -country trade.  So that the crime  of 
money laundering based on digital assets is very easy to do and can have a worldwide 
network.

INTRODUCTION  
 
I.BACKGROUND  
A. Technology Development and Crime Opportunities  
 
The development of Information Technology that has developed now, has presented a 
variety of digital services, in which the technological information sophistication is 
able to easily integrate all fields of digital services so as to make the world become 
borderless, this has led to social, cultural, economic and economic changes. and fast 
and significant legal behavior.  Nevertheless, the conditions in Indonesia that are 
growing and developing towards an information technology -based industrial society, 
in so me respects, especially in the Legal Sector, are still lagging behind to keep abreast 
of such information technology.  
The development of information technology which currently has many benefits 
for people in Indonesia, such as some development and advancem ent in facilities that 
occur in the fields of business, government, education, and many more.  The ease in 
question is very young in interacting without having to deal directly with each 
other.  So that this can have a negative advantage, on the other hand i t also impacts the 
negative impact on the unprepared regulations that are proportional to the effects of 
criminal acts which will continue to grow and be misused by the community, 
resulting in unlawful acts.  
Utilization of the development of information te chnology which has many 
positive impacts but also cannot be denied many also have negative impacts.  Crime 
that uses information technology based is considered more effective and efficient, this 
is because it can easily access to all corners of the world, m eaning conventional crime 
such as fraud, theft, threatening, embezzlement, gambling, defamation, money 
laundering to criminal acts of terrorism and attorney through the Information 
Technology media can be done  online  by individuals or groups and or a corpo ration, 
with the risk of being caught or in contact with a very small law with a result of 
greater losses for both society and the state.  This causes the behavior of individuals 
and groups in committing criminal acts to be increasingly sophisticated by uti lizing 
information -based information technology from the internet. Development is always 
evidenced by the existence of innovation and creativity, in this case in the field of 
information technology which has provided many conveniences for human life.  The 
business world is increasingly competing to always innovate and win the market, 
where when business people do not do that, then they will always be left behind and 
businesses will not easily survive to face market demand.  132           JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20

Published by Postgraduate Program, Master  of Laws , Faculty of Law, Universitas Negeri Semarang, Indonesia  Joseph Schumpeter (1934) has argued  that based on his theory that “ creative 
destruction”  entrepreneurial values will bring up new markets through new methods.  If 
Joseph Schumpeter's thoughts were clashed with legal instruments, then of course the 
law is not able to catch up with the dynam ics of this very dynamic business. That 
what has been stated by Josseph Schumpeter the value of entrepreneurship is an 
innovation and creativity that is always developing in the business market using new 
methods, where the intuitive thing will greatly faci litate the community in using a 
population offered by Business Actors, so because it is product which has been 
introduced to the public by providing conveniences, then the legal basis or regulations 
or legislation may not necessarily be used as a legal bas is for these stone products.  
 
B. Financial Technology  in the Industrial Revolution  
 
Financial Technology  (Fintech) is a form of application of information technology in the 
financial sector.  This is evidenced by the emergence of various digital financial 
innovation models that first started in 2004, financial institutions in the UK that run 
money lending services.  Then the digital financial model through software, the crypto -
currency that was conceived by Satoshi Nakamoto in around 2008. In histo rical 
perspective, the core concept of the development of information technology is actually 
inseparable from the application of the concept of  peer -to-peer landing  (P2P) used by 
Napster in 1999 for  music sharing (Pratama 2016).  
The rapid development of th e Investigation Technique was marked by the 
emergence of fintech, where the intended fintech  is one of the digital currencies (cyrto -
curency) which in  relation to the history of this currency was made by Satoshi 
Nakamoto in 2008, using a  peer -to-peer  (P2P)  concept application  ), so that the 
development of the P2p technique is emerging, then there are financial service 
invasions in the field of financial services.  
The Industrial Revolution has many new technical developments, as it develops, 
the forms of cri mes are also developing, but generally the crimes are still conventional, 
only the methods applied always change with the times.  Ronni R. Nitibaskara argued 
that: "Social interaction that minimizes physical presence is another feature of the 
information te chnology revolution.  With this kind of interaction, social relations 
deviation in the form of crime will adjust its shape to that character. "  
  
C. Renewal of Criminal Law in Technology Issues  
 
Reform in criminal law as part of a criminal law policy in which the rapid 
development of information technology is also important for the renewal of new 
norms that apply in accordance with existing values in Indonesian society.  The 
importance of reforming a criminal justice system as a whole with due regard to legal 
culture, legal structure, and legal substance so that criminal law policy occupies a very 
strategic position in the development of modern criminal law to achieve certainty and 
usefulness of the law.   JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20          133

Published by Postgraduate Program, Master  of Laws , Faculty of Law, Uni versitas Negeri Semarang, Indonesia  "That there are many reasons that can be cited as the cause of a change in society, 
but changes in the application of the results of modern technology are widely cited as 
one of the causes for social change (Raharjo, 1980). That the occurrence of these 
changes can be related to a social values, behavioral pat terns, organization, 
arrangement of state / community institutions, and the authority of social interaction 
and so on where a change that occurs in the community will have an impact on the 
legal pattern in society.  
The globalization process gave birth to a  phenomenon that changed the 
conventional communication model by giving birth to reality in the virtual 
world  (virtual reality)  that is known today with the internet.  The internet is developing 
so rapidly as a culture of modern society, said to be a cultur e because through the 
internet a variety of cyber community activities such as thinking, creating, and acting 
can be expressed in it, whenever and wherever.  Its presence has formed a separate 
world known as cyber -space  or pseudo world is a world of compute r-based 
communication offers a new form of virtual reality (indirect and intangible) 
(Rahardjo, 2002)  
As stated by Agus Rahardjo above, a globalization mechanism is shown by the 
initial to interact through conventional methods to change into interaction in  
cyberspace or interact using the internet, in relation to the internet, then a separate 
world directly or indirectly will occur a society and free to interact throughout the 
world.  
Information technology is growing so rapidly that it must be made responsi vely 
related to the regulation, the law cannot be made before the problem, but in general 
the countermeasure is made first, and this will be much better.  The development of 
digital crime has indeed been known as  cyber war or cyber law  , where there are so 
many  positive  impacts  , but on the one hand there are also many negative 
impacts.  This is in line with the term Barda Nawawi Arief which states 
that :  cybercrime  identical with "criminal acts in  cyber space  " or  " cyber space  " or commonly also 
known as "  cybercrime  "( Nawawi Arief, 2006)  
Nawawi Arief (2003), Criminalization policy is a policy in determining an act 
that was not a criminal offense (not convicted) into a criminal act (an act that can be 
convicted).  So in essence, the policy of criminalization  of information technology 
crime is part of a criminal policy ( criminal policy  ) using the means of criminal law 
(penal  ), and therefore includes part of the "criminal law policy" ( penal policy  ), especially 
the formulation policy.  Furthermore, according t o the BNA, the criminalization policy 
is not just a policy of establishing or formulating or formulating what can be convicted 
(including criminal sanctions), but also includes the problem of how the formulation / 
legislation policy is arranged in a unifie d harmonious and integrated legal system 
(legislative policy).

FORMULATION  
A.  Identification of the P roblems  
 
From the background description above,  problems  can be identified  , namely, starting 
from (1) Digital assets which are always developing rapidly can be used as a tool for 
money laundering;  (2) The criminal law in force in Indonesia regulates the crime of 
money laundering, which does not mean that the regulation of the criminal act in force 
in I ndonesia is carried out on the basis of digital assets;  (3) The  legal policy 
perspective is a legal renewal, in which criminal law must be able to keep up with the 
times as a form of countermeasures for a crime, especially in this case digital assets 
that are growing very fast.  
B. Limitation of the Problem  
 
The problem is limited  based on above problem identification, the research will focus 
on the  "Criminal Law Policy Against Money Laundering Prevention -Based Digital 
Asset" . With the limitation of this proble m, it is hoped that researchers will focus 
more on studying and examining the problems that exist in  the Criminal Law Policy 
Against Digital Asset -Based Money Laundering Crime . 
 
C. Formulation of the Problem  
 
The problems studied will be more assertive and writing legal research to achieve the 
objectives it is necessary to formulate the problem as follows:  
1. Does digital assets open up opportunities for money laundering;  
2. Whether the current criminal law policy is a comprehensive provision in deal ing 
with digital asset -based money laundering crimes;  
3. What is the prospect of a comprehensive criminal law policy on the prevention 
of digital  asset -based money laundering  in the future  
  
LITERATURE REVIEW  
I. CRIMINAL LAW POLICY  
A. The Foundation of Criminal Law Policy  
 
National development is development that aims to realize people.  Where is the 
national development of Indonesia to achieve a just, prosperous and prosperous 
society both materially and spiritually based on Pancasila and the 1945 Consti tution. 
So that one part of national development is development in the field of law, which is 
known as  law reform . . The renewal of national law as part of a series of national 
development is carried out thoroughly  and integrated both criminal law, civil l aw, and 
administrative law, as well as formal law.  
Efforts to reform the law are inseparable from public policies in controlling and 
shaping the pattern of how far the community is regulated and directed.  Thus it is  JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20          135

the law and public policies that are published will have broad implications in the 
social, economic and political fields.  Unfortunately, specialization both in work, 
education and research are based on these two di sciplines (law and social science), so 
that various information sourced from the two do not always meet  (converge)  even 
often not the same and congruent  (incongruent)  . 
Fifth  UN Congress  (1976) stated that the term policy comes from 
English  policy  or in Dutch  politie.  Black's  Law  Dictionary  identifies  Policy  as: The general 
principles by which a government is guided in its management of public affairs,... or 
principles and standards regarded by the legislature or by the  policy should be 
coordinated and th e whole should be integrated into a general social policy of each 
country. "  
Sudarto (1965) stated that the crime prevention policy or commonly known as 
“criminal politics” according to Sudarto is a rational effort from the community in 
tackling crime.  This definition is taken from the definition of Marc Ancel 
who  formulated criminal politics as "  the rational organization of the control of crime  by 
society  ", Marc Ancel,  Social Defense  (translation of  La Nouvelle Defense Sociale ), 
The purpose of dealing wi th crime is to protect the community to achieve 
community welfare.  The formulation of the objectives of such criminal politics is 
stated in one of the 34th training course reports organized by UNAFEI in Tokyo in 
1973 as follows:  Summary Report, Resource Ma terial Series Most of the group members agreed 
some discussion that "protection of the society" could be accepted as the final goal of criminal policy, 
although not the ultimate aim of society, which might perhaps be described by terms like "happiness of 
citizens", "a wholesome and cultural living", "social welfare" or "equality"  (UNAFEI, 1974: 95)  
Agreement on the results of the course can be a foundation in criminal policy as 
an effort to tackle crime for  social welfare  and social  protection.  
  
B. Criminal Law Countermeasures  
 
The use of criminal law in regulating the public (through criminal legislation) is 
essentially part of a policy step ( policy ). Furthermore, to determine how a rational step 
(effort) in conducting a policy cannot also be separa ted from the objectives of the 
development policy itself integrally.  Thus in an effort to determine any policy 
(including criminal law policy) is always related and cannot be separated from the 
national development goal itself, namely how to realize prospe rity for the community.  
Nawawi Arief (2006) stated that crime prevention policies or commonly 
known as “ penal policy ” According to GP Hoefnagles can be pursued by:  
1. The application of criminal law ( criminal law application ) 
2. Prevention without crime ( prevent ion without punishment ) 
3. Influencing the public's view of crime and punishment through mass media 
(influencing views of society on crime and punishment ) 
The first category is categorized into efforts to overcome crime through 
the penalty  line, while the sec ond and third includes efforts to overcome crime through 136           JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20

Published by Postgraduate Program, Master  of Laws , Faculty of Law, Universitas Negeri Semarang, Indonesia  the non -penalty  line.  With regard to the 2 (two) facilities, Muladi (2002) emphasized 
that: Criminal policy is a rational and organized effort of a society to tackle 
crime.  Criminal policies aside fr om being repressive through the criminal justice 
system (the  penal  approach  ) can also be carried out by means of "  non -penal  " means 
through various prevention efforts without having to use the criminal justice system, 
for example efforts to improve commu nity mental health, legal counseling, legal 
reform and civil law administration, and so on.  
The non -penal  approach  covers a  very broad  area of  crime  prevention  and covers 
both policy and practice.  Non -penal  means  are basically preventive measures, starting  
from the education of the code of ethics  to the renewal of civil law and administrative 
law.  The policy varies from one country to another according to the cultural, political 
and intellectual backgrounds that exist in each society.  
Furthermore, criminal policy ( criminal policy ) which includes a penal approach 
through the criminal justice system, it will naturally come into contact with 
criminalization that regulates the scope of acts that are against the law, criminal 
liability, and sanctions that can be imposed, both in the form of a criminal ( punishment ) 
and actions ( treatment ). It is means of crime prevention policies are carried out using 
the means of  penal  (criminal law), then criminal law policy ( penal policy ) must pay 
attention and lead to the achie vement of the objectives of social policy in the form 
of social welfare  and social defense .  
Tackling crime must have a balance between the means of  punishment  and non -
 reasoning  (integral approach).  From the perspective of criminal politics, the most 
strategic policy is  through  non -penal  means  because it is more preventive. Even 
so, penal  policies are  still needed in the prevention of crime, because criminal law  is one 
of the means of social policy to channel "  social dislike  " or  social disapproval/ socia l 
abhorrence which is also expected to be a means of social protection ( social defense ). The 
means of  "penal"  is "penal policy"  or "penal law enforcement policy"  very vital role in the 
process of law enforcement to tackle crime.  The 3rd criminology seminar in 1976 in 
one of its conclusions stated:  
 
Criminal law should be maintained as a means of  social  defense  in the sense 
of protecting the public against crime by  repairing or  rehabilitating  the 
creator without reducing the balance of the  interests of the individual 
(maker) and the community  (Muladi & Nawawi Arief, 1998).  
 
Muladi (2002) also emphasized political crimes committed by means 
of penal  means the use of the criminal justice system, ranging from criminalization to 
the criminal exe cution.  The approach by means of  punishment  must be continuously 
carried out through various efforts to improve the criminal justice system, both from 
the aspect of legislation (criminalization, decriminalization and depenalization ), 
improvement of system infrastructure, improving the quality  of human resources, and 
increasing public participation in the criminal justice system.  Systemically, the 
criminal justice system includes a network of justice systems (with sub -systems of the  JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20          137

means.  Criminal law in this case includes material criminal law, formal and criminal 
law.  
The operationalization of legal policies by means of  "penal"  (criminal) can be 
done through a process that consists of three stages namely:  
1. Formulation stage (legislative policy)  
2. Application phase (judicial/judicial policy)  
3. Stage of execution (executive/administrative policy).  
Based on the description of the three stages of the criminal law enforcement 
policy c ontained within three powers/authorities, namely legislative/formulative 
authority in terms of determining or formulating what can be criminally oriented to 
the main problems in criminal law include acts that are against the law, error / 
responsibility wha t penalties and sanctions may be imposed by lawmakers.  The 
application stage is the power in terms of implementing criminal law by law 
enforcement officers or the court and the executive/administrative stage in 
implementing criminal law by the executing / criminal execution apparatus.  
 
C. Policy  Formulation  
 
Judging from the perspective of criminal law, the formulation policy must pay 
attention to internal harmonization with the criminal law system or the general penal 
code in force today.  It cannot be said th at there is a harmonization/synchronization if 
the formulation policy is outside the current criminal law system  
Formulation policy is the most strategic stage of the “ penal policy  “ because at 
that stage the legislature has the authority to determine or f ormulate criminal actions 
which are oriented to the main problems of criminal law, including acts that are 
against the law, mistakes , criminal liability and witnesses what can be 
imposed.  Therefore, efforts to tackle crime are not only the task of law enf orcement 
officials but also the work of lawmakers (legislative apparatus) (Nawawi Arief, 2012).  
Planning  (planning)  in combating crime with the criminal law system at the 
stage of formulation in essence according to Nils Jareborg covers three main problems  
in the structure of the criminal law system, namely the problem: Formulation of 
criminal acts / Criminalization and Criminal Threatened  (criminalization and threatened 
punishment)  
1. Criminalization  (adjudication of punishment sentencing)  
2. Criminal  execution (execution of punishment)  
In line with the above concept, the draft of the new Criminal Code is prepared 
by departing from 3 (three) main materials / substances / problems in criminal law, 
namely:  
1. Criminal matters  
2. Problems of error or criminal liability.  
3. Criminal and criminal matters.  
All material/substantive criminal law, formal criminal law and criminal 
implementation law can be seen as a single unit of the criminal system ( the sentencing 138           JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20

Published by Postgraduate Program, Master  of Laws , Faculty of Law, Universitas Negeri Semarang, Indonesia  system ). LHC Hulsman put forward the notion of a crimin al system as “ Statutory rules 
relating to  criminal sanctions and crimes” ( the statute rules relating to penal sanctions and 
punishment ). 
From the above understanding Barda Nawawi Arief provides a broad 
understanding of punishment as a process of giving or imposing a criminal sentence 
by a judge, it can be said that the criminal system includes the understanding of:  
1. The whole system (laws and regulations) for criminalization;        
2. The whole system (the rule of law) for granting or imposing and carrying out 
criminal offenses.        
3. The whole system (statutory regulations) for the functioning or operationalization 
or concretization of crime;        
4. The whole system (legislation) that regulates how the criminal law is enforced or 
operationalized concretely so th at someone is given sanctions (criminal law).        
The question of the formulation of a criminal act/criminalization arises when 
we are confronted with an act that is detrimental to another person or community 
whose laws do not yet exist or have not been found.  In connection with the 
criminalization policy according to Sudarto, attention needs to be paid to the 
following core matters:  
1. The use of criminal law must pay attention to the goals of national development, 
which is to realize a prosperous just soci ety that is evenly materially and 
spiritually based on Pancasila;  in connection with this (the use of) criminal law 
aims to tackle crime and make granting to the act of prevention itself, for the 
sake of welfare and community protection.  
2. Actions that are e ndeavored to be prevented or endured by criminal law must 
constitute "undesirable acts", such asacts that bring harm (material and 
spiritual) to the community members.  
3. The use of criminal law must also take into account the principle of costs and 
results ( cost and benefit principle ) 
4. The use of criminal law must also pay attention to the work capacity or 
capability of law enforcement agencies, namely the network until there is 
overloading of the workload ( overbelasting ). 
Teguh Prasetyo and Abdul Halim Barkatullah (2005) based on the above 
considerations, it can be concluded that the reasons for criminalization in general 
are: The existence of victims:  
1. Criminalization is not solely intended for retaliation;  
2. Must be based  on the principle of principle ratio  ; and 
3. There is a social agreement  (public support)  
Criminal law policy issues related to the criminalization of what conduct is 
made criminal acts and  penalization  such as what should sanction imposed on the 
offender. Criminalization and  penalization  are central issues for which a  policy -oriented 
approach is needed  . Criminalization ( criminalization ) covering the scope of an unlawful

excessive criminali zation (  over -criminalization ), which actually reduces the authority 
of the law.  Criminalization in  material criminal  law will also be followed by pragmatic 
steps in formal criminal law for the purpose of investigation and prosecution  (Muladi, 
2003).  
D. Law E nforcement Policy  
 
Criminal law enforcement is part of criminal politics as one part of the overall 
crime prevention policy, indeed the enforcement of criminal law is not the only 
hope for being able to resolve or overcome the crime completely.  This is rea sonable 
because in essence the crime is a humanitarian and social problem that cannot be 
solved solely by criminal law.  
Muladi, (1995: 25 -26) highlighted that although criminal law enforcement 
in the context of overcoming crime is not the only hope, but it s success is expected 
because in this field of law enforcement is at stake the meaning of the State based 
on law.  The role of law enforcement officers in the State based on the law was also 
stated by Satjipto Rahardjo  . Satjipto Rahardjo who stated,  "The l aw does not have any 
function, if it is not applied or enforced for lawbreakers, those who enforce the law in the field are 
law enforcement officers." Henry Campbell Black (1999: 797).  The term enforcement in 
English is known as  enforcement  in the  black la w dictionary,  meaning  the act of putting 
something as a law into effect, the execution of a law.   Whereas  law enforcement 
officer  means  those whose duty it is to preserve the peace.  In a large Indonesian dictionary,  
Sudarto (1986) in the same context also emphasized that law enforcement is 
attention and cultivation, both acts that are against the law that actually happened 
(onrecht in actu  ) and acts against the law that might occur ( onrecht in potentie ). 
Meanwhile, according to Soerjono Soekanto, conceptua lly, the core of  law 
enforcement lies in the activity of harmonizing the values relations that are set out 
in the rules that are solid and manifest and action attitude as a series of translation 
of the final stage values, to create, maintain, and maintain peace association of life.  
For this reason, Adji (2005) concerned that part of  social policy  , this law 
enforcement policy covers the process of what is called  criminal policy  . This 
conception of law enforcement policies will later be applied thr ough the 
institutional level through a system called the  Criminal Justice System , hence there is 
a link between the Law Enforcement Policy and the Criminal Justice System, 
namely this sub -system of the Criminal Justice System will implement a law 
enforceme nt policy in the form of preventing and overcoming the occurrence of a 
crime in which the roles of this sub -system will become more acceptable together 
with the role of the community, and without the role of the community, law 
enforcement policies will not  be optimized.  
Soerjono Soekanto (2009) stated that the main problem of law enforcement 
actually lies in the factors that might influence it.  According to Soerjono Soekanto 
the factors that influence law enforcement have a neutral meaning, so that  the 
posi tive or negative impact lies in the contents of these factors, as follows:  
1. The legal factor itself (the law)  140           JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20

Published by Postgraduate Program, Master  of Laws , Faculty of Law, Universitas Negeri Semarang, Indonesia  2. Law enforcement factors are those who form and apply the law.  
3. Factors of facilities or facilities that support law enforcement.  
4. Community factors, namely the environment in which the law applies or is 
applied.  
5. Cultural factors, namely as the results of works, inventions, and tastes based on 
human initiative in the association of life.  
These five factors are closely interrelated, because it is the essence of law 
enforcement, also a measure of the effectiveness of law enforcement.  Among all 
these factors, according to Soerjono Soekanto law enforcement factors occupy a 
central point as a m easure of the extent to which contributions to the welfare of 
society. Law enforcement is very bound by criminal procedure and 
proof.   Harahap  (2000)  stated that proof is a problem that plays a role in the 
process of hearing court hearings.  Through proof, the defendant's fate is 
determined.  If the results of the evidence using the evidence determined by the law 
"are not enough" to prove the guilt of the defendant, the defendant is "acquitted" of 
the sentence.  On the other hand, if the defendant's guilt can be proven with 
evidence called Article 184 of the Criminal Procedure Code the defendant is 
declared "guilty".  He will be sentenced.  
Harahap also highlighted that the Criminal Procedure Code (KUHAP) 
explicitly mentions several pieces of evidence that can be  submitted by parties 
who litigate before a trial.  Based on Article 184 of the Criminal Procedure 
Code,  the evidence is: (1) Witness statement; (2) Expert statement; (3) Letter; (4) 
Hints; and (5) Defendant's statement.  
While the explanation of Article 184  of the Criminal Procedure Code is 
explained  "In the event of a quick examination, the judge's conviction was sufficiently supported 
by a valid piece of evidence ". Based on Article 184 and its explanation, it means that 
except for a quick examination, to s upport the judge's conviction, more than one 
or at least two valid evidences are needed.  For this matter Article 183 of the 
Criminal Procedure Code  Explanation of Article 184 of Law No.8 of 1981 
concerning the Criminal Procedure Code of the State Gazette o f the Republic of 
Indonesia Number 76 is explicitly formulated that "Judges may not impose a crime 
on a person except if at least two legitimate pieces of evidence he gained the 
conviction that a crime had actually taken place and that the defendant was gu ilty 
of it ”.  Thus in the Criminal Procedure Code explicitly provides legality that in 
addition to being based on the elements of the judge's conviction, proof with at 
least two valid evidences is necessary to support the element of error in 
determining wh ether a person is actually proven to have committed a crime or not.  
  
E. Understanding of Criminal Law Policy  
 
The development of globalization and the advancement of information technology 
demand the renewal of criminal law as part of the applicable criminal  law policy in 
accordance with the values of Indonesian society.  Countermeasures against 
information technology criminal acts need to be balanced with improvement and 
development of the criminal law system as a whole, which includes the  JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20          141

Published by Postgraduate Program, Master  of Laws , Faculty of Law, Uni versitas Negeri Semarang, Indonesia  development of cu lture, structure and substance of criminal law.  In this case, 
criminal law policy occupies a strategic position in the development of modern 
criminal law.  
Law policy  (legal policy)  within the meaning of state policies  (public policy)  in 
the field of law sh ould be understood as part of social policy is the effort each 
society / government to improve the welfare of its citizens in all aspects of life.  This 
can contain two dimensions that are related to each other, namely  social welfare 
policy  and social prote ction  policy.  
While the definition of criminal law according to Sudarto is to contain legal 
rules that bind to acts that meet certain conditions  in the form of criminal 
consequences.  The granting of criminal law in the general sense is a field of 
lawmakers  based on the principle of legality, which originated from the 
Aufklarung era, which in short reads:  nullum crimen, nulla poena, sine praevia  lege 
(poenali)  . In short,  nullum crimen sine lege  means there is no criminal offense  without 
law and  nulla poena sine lege  means there is no criminal without law.  So the law 
establishes and limits which actions and penalties (sanctions) can be imposed on 
violators.  So to wear  poena  or criminal requires the law (criminal) first.  
The definition of legal policy and crim inal law above provides a definition of 
a criminal law  policy (criminal policy / strafrechtspolitiek  ) as, how to try or make 
formulate a good criminal law.  Such an understanding can also be seen in the 
definition of " penal policy”, proposed by Marc Ancel,  that  penal policy  is a science as 
well as an art which ultimately has a practical goal to enable positive legal 
regulations to be formulated better and to provide guidance not only to legislators, 
but also to courts that apply the law and also to the orga nizers or executors of 
court decisions  (Ancel, & Paul, 1965: 4 -5). Ancel argued that the twentieth 
century criminal law system still had to be  created.  Such a system can only be 
devised and refined by the joint efforts of  all people of good will and also b y all 
experts in the social sciences.  126 The criminal law system consists of (1) criminal 
law regulations and sanctions; (2) a criminal law procedure;  and (3) an 
implementation mechanism (criminal).   
 The definition of the "criminal law system" from Marc Ancel provides  A. 
Mulder's  foundation  in providing a policy or political understanding of criminal 
law ( penal  policy /Strafrechtspolitiek  ), to determine:   
1. How far the applicable criminal provisions nee d to be changed or updated ( in 
welk opzicht de bestaande straf bepalingen herzien dienen te worden ); 
2. What can be done to prevent the occurrence of criminal acts ( wat ganggrad 
worden om strafrechtelijk gedrad verkomen  ); 
3. The method of investigation, prosecu tion, trial and criminal conduct must be 
carried out ( hoe de operating, vervolging, acting en tenuitvoerlegging van straffen  dient te 
verloppen ). 
Based on the above policy, efforts and policies to make  criminal law regulations 
which in essence cannot be separated from the purpose  of crime prevention.  So, the 
policy or politics of criminal law is also  part of criminal politics.  In other words, from 142           JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20

Published by Postgraduate Program, Master  of Laws , Faculty of Law, Universitas Negeri Semarang, Indonesia  the perspective of criminal politics,  the politics of criminal law is identical to the 
understanding of crime  prevention policies with criminal law.  
 
METHOD  
 
Legal research  according to  Cohen and Olson  is "Legal research is the process of finding the 
law that governs activities in human society  " legal research is a process that constructs the 
discovery of legal thinking that governs community activities.  In line with  this , P. 
Mahmud Marzuki stated "that legal research is a process to find the rule of law, legal 
principles and legal doctrines to answer the legal issues at hand".  
Legal research is research to find  a formulation of legal development.  Research 
is a basic tool in the development of science and technology.  This is because the 
research aims to reveal the truth systematically, methodologically and 
consistently.  Through the research process, analysis and construction of the data that 
has been collected and processed is carried out.  Legal research is a scientific activity 
that is   based on certain methods, systematic and thinking, which aims to study one or 
several specific legal phenomena, by analyzing the m. So that the legal facts are then 
used as a reference resolution for problems that arise in the symptoms in social and 
state life. Ashofa (2013: 20 -21) states that a qualitative approach which means 
focusing on the general principles underlying the manif estation of symptom units in 
human life, or patterns that are analyzed by socio -cultural phenomena using the 
culture of the community concerned. to get a picture of the prevailing patterns.  These 
patterns are analyzed again using objective theory.  
 
DIGITAL ASSETS AND MONEY LAUNDERING IN 
INDONESIA  
 
I. DIGITAL ASSETS BECOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR MONEY 
LAUNDERING  
A. Development of Digital Assets  
 
The industrial revolution has reached the era of 5.0 in which industry 5.0 
conceptualized the continuation of the  cloud  and computer  -based 4.0 
industry.  Technology 5.0 by using calobaration from biology, for example, is artificial 
intelligence  AI, robotics,  internet of things  (IoT) and  big data.  Reported by  Bluenotes  
(2019), according to a 2018 report by Japan's leading business body, the Japan 
Business Federation (Keidanren), Society 5.0 will depend heavily on AI, robotics, 
internet of things (IoT) and big data to provide excellence technology needed by 
Japan to over come the problem of aging today.    
The emergence of Society 5.0 that was echoed by Japan was considered 
inseparable from the condition of the population in the State of Sakura.  The number of 
young Japanese who are shrinking into the workforce has found the  prospect of  JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20          143

researchers on population trends is Professor Ryuichi Kaneko, a visiting professor at 
Meiji University and former Deputy Director General of the National Population a nd 
Social Security Research Institute His research shows that based on current trends, 
Japan's population tends to shrink from 127 million in 2015 to 88 million in 2065 and 
59.7 million at the turn of the next century in 2100. As people move towards the tu rn 
of the century, many other countries will face the challenges of a labor force that is 
declining and a rapidly growing population  (TechnoZone, 2019).  
Indonesia itself has entered the industrial revolution 4.0, in which the industry 
revolutionary presents disruptive technology that results in rapid changes and has the 
ability to undermine large companies that were previously pioneers in mastering 
technol ogy.  This phenomenon also allows people to invest in investments with a 
different model than before by utilizing digital technology as part of the development 
of information technology.  In addition, digital assets are starting to feel the effects of 
indust ry development 4.0.  One of them we can see from the development of crypto -
currency that allows to be able to invest in digital currencies on a P2P basis and not be 
limited worldwide  
However, technological developments not only facilitate banking -based non -
cash transactions, but give birth to financial digitalization in a new platform in 
the form of digital currency or crypto -currency.  The practice developed by Bitcoin and 
Farad Egypt.  In its development, digital -based currencies are able to show a more 
stab le value compared to conventional currency rates.  This currency has been used by 
some of the world community in trade transactions. OJK will only regulate fintech  
business actors whose core business includes deposits (lending funds), lending (fund 
distribu tion), capital raising (capital collection), and market provisioning (market 
provision). Whereas BI will regulate fintech business actors whose main business is in 
the form of clearing and settlement (settlement of payment transactions).   
  
B. Blockchain Tech nology and Its Complexity  
 
As a vast country, Indonesia faces two main challenges in the midst of rapid economic 
development and national development, namely the urgency of an integrated 
infrastructure and the credibility of governance in various sectors.  Lack of business 
infrastructure, high cases of corruption in many sectors and  human error  in managing 
data in both the government and private  sectors are still common  factors that shape 
Indonesia's reputation in the eyes of the global community. Regarding data 
management, the obstacle to achieving accuracy lies in the centralized approach of the 
internet -based system that was built.  A software system that is basically designed to 
send data from one party to another requires a  centralized  server  as a publish er and 
data manager.  When there is a disruption to the  server , the website cannot be accessed 
and automatically the user cannot use the service optimally.  
Blockchain  technology  was born in response to the concerns of a number of 
parties about the workings  of a centralized  software . This technology was born in 
2009 at the same time as the emergence of Bitcoin —a virtual currency that is 144           JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20

Published by Postgraduate Program, Master  of Laws , Faculty of Law, Universitas Negeri Semarang, Indonesia  becoming the current trend.  Technology  blockchain  is the underlying technology 
Bitcoin  goes without relying on  server  centrally and thus avoid the risk of  downtime . 
The blockchain  system  comes with changing the centralized approach to 
decentralized. In principle, blockchain   technology  conditions each  server  that runs 
this software to  form a consensus network automatically to mutually replicate 
transaction data and mutually verify existing data.  Therefore, when one  server  is hacked , 
the server  can be ignored because it is considered to have data that is different from the 
majority of  the other server  networks  . 
This makes  blockchain  technology  relatively far stronger against attacks than 
centralized technology because there is always at least 1  server  running to handle 
transactions.  Blockchain  technology  allows network consensus to record and  validate 
each transaction so that data that has been entered cannot be falsified, lost or 
damaged so that it cannot be manipulated by the network provider.  
The analogy of how a  blockchain  works is  almost the same as a cash book in a 
bank which records all  transactions made by its users.  The difference is that only the 
authorities can access the transaction information in the bank cash book, while 
transactions through the  blockchain  can be seen by all users because the information 
collected is also distribu ted to everyone who runs the  server . In addition, 
because  server  access is  granted to everyone, no party can falsify or modify 
transactions.  
The sector that first explored the  blockchain  was certainly the financial 
sector.  Bank OCBC, for example, conducted  a pilot transfer between Singapore and 
Malaysia branches which proved to only take 5 minutes.  Bank Santander, one of the 
largest in the  UK, projects that this technology can save bank operating costs by more 
than 20 billion dollars per year.  
During its de velopment,  blockchain  technology was  also utilized by other 
sectors.  Sony Global Education in collaboration with IBM published articles and 
diplomas on the  blockchain  network  so that they could not be forged, damaged or 
lost.  In the health sector, its appl ication is carried out on a broader scale by several 
countries, one of which is Estonia.  One patient's record or medical record at hospital 
A can be accessed by hospital B when the patient is treated at hospital B, in a short 
time because it has been recor ded in the  blockchain  network  . 
In the food sector, IBM is collaborating with food manufacturers and 
distributors to reduce contamination in the global supply chain.  Through 
the blockchain  , food transactions around the world can be collected massively, so  
that if there is a case of food contamination, it is very easy for the relevant authorities 
to track the source and carry out rapid isolation.  Another example is Alibaba in 
collaboration with Pricewaterhouse Coopers to help solve China's food security. Er nst 
& Young's accounting and consulting firm, in a different case, launched  a blockchain 
platform  to facilitate a shared  car ownership scheme. Thus blockchain technology  is 
basically a 'digital transcript' that was created to avoid fraud, but at the same t ime 
allows access for third parties as needed.  
This technology, which is still very young, has not yet been applied in all fields, 
and many experiments continue to be carried out by many companies.  But I believe in  JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20          145

in the financial sector and also throughout the industrial sector.  This system is 
believed to be effective in promoting transparency, security and accuracy of 
transaction data.   
 
C. Crowd Funding  
 
Fundraising, charity, and other social activities can now also be done through startups 
engaged in  crowd funding . More precisely,  crowd funding  is a startup that provides a 
fundraising platform to be channeled back to people in need, such as victims of 
natural disasters, victims of war, funding the creation of works, and so on.  The 
fundraising is done  online.  One example of the  biggest  crowd funding startup  is 
Kitabisa.com.  This startup creates a place  where  we can help others in an easier, safer 
and more e fficient way.          
bookisa.com  is a fintech startup that provides an internet -based platform 
for online  fundraising.  In the past, fundraising was generally done conventionally or 
took to the field, a website of Kitabisa.com now creates a forum for us to be able to 
help others in an easier, safer and more efficient way.  In accordance with the culture 
in our c ountry, Indonesia, which adheres to the philosophy of mutual cooperation, 
Kitabisa.com  is an  online  mutual cooperation platform  that allows many people to raise 
funds with various humanitarian objectives, such as social activities, funding the 
creation of works, and in the future not close the possibility of donations in order to 
realize creative ideas in the digital age. But broadly speaking, Kitabisa.com  is more 
fundraising for social purposes.      
Fundraising activities through Kitabisa.com also pay atte ntion to the security 
aspect, where all fundraising activities carried out have been ensured to have followed 
the verification procedures or processes to ensure their accuracy.  Besides that, 
Kitabisa.com  also tries to monitor every fundraising activity tha t takes 
place.  Fundraisers must also make financial use reports of funds collected so donors 
can clearly know where the money they have contributed, for example, is to help 
victims of natural disasters, medical assistance, various national issues, and othe r 
social or humanitarian activities.  
  
D. E- Money  
 
E-Money or electronic money, as the name suggests, is  money that is packaged  into 
the digital world, so that it can be said to be an electronic wallet.  This money can 
generally be used to shop, pay bills, et c. through an application.  One of those 
electronic wallets is Doku . Doku is an application that can be easily uploaded 
on smartphones.  Doku is equipped with a credit card link feature and electronic money 
or cash wallet , which we can use to shop both  onlin e and offline  anytime and anywhere 
through the application.             
Doku is an electronic wallet in the form of the dokuwallet.com application that 
can be easily uploaded on  smartphones  . Doku is equipped with a credit card link feature 146           JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20

various  merchants  that have joined with Doku.  The benefits of this service, we can use 
Doku  anytime and anywhere through the application.            
Besides that, even if we don't have a credit card or bank account, we can still 
make transactions  online . We can also pay household bills such as electricity, 
telephone, PAM, installments and other p ayments through Doku.  Uniquely, when you 
run out of cash or balance from your Doku account, you can also request and receive 
money from fellow Doku users, the way you can learn from the website.  Doku is also 
trusted as a service that applies security stand ards in accordance with applicable 
regulations.   
 
E. Insurance  
 
The type of startup engaged in insurance is quite interesting.  Because usually 
insurance that we know so far is conventional insurance, where we set aside some 
money per month as a mandatory cont ribution to get benefits from such insurance in 
the future, this type of startup insurance does not all work that way.  There is also an 
insurance startup that provides services to its users in the form of information about 
the nearest hospital, trusted doc tor, hospital reference, and so on.  HiOscar.com  is a 
startup type like this.  This startup was built with the aim of providing a simple, 
intuitive, and proactive way to help its customers navigate their health system.  This 
startup  collaborates with provider s or with world -class doctors and the best hospitals 
who want to work together to help manage the health of their members.   
HiOscar.com  was founded in 2012 in New York, Texas and California, which 
provides a  platform  for your health care plan.  How is this health insurance startup 
different from conventional insurance?  HiOscar.com was built with the aim of 
providing a simple, intuitive, and proactive way to help its customers navigate their 
health system.  The high cost of hospitals in the United States  encou rages this startup 
to provide services to the community to get easy access to better and more efficient 
health care.  In order to meet the needs of these customers, HiOscar.com collaborates 
with providers or with world -class doctors and the best hospitals w ho want to work 
together to help manage the health of their members.  Oscar also strives to be a 
provider of accurate and consumer -friendly health services.  Oscar currently has 
135,000 patients who prove that the startup is successful and will continue to g row in 
the future.    
Through HiOscar.com we can do routine maintenance at an affordable cost.  In 
addition, we can also get health guidance from expert doctors, nurses, and treatment 
guides as well as possible, and  find doctors who understand the health sch edule that 
you want to go through for the whole body, while saving money.  Consulting or 
talking directly by phone for free with a great doctor is also not a taboo thing to do 
at HiOscar.com.

G. Payment  Gateway  
 
The growth of  e-commerce  companies  also triggers more startups to become a 
bridge between  e-commerce  and customers, especially in the case of payment  
systems.  The service provided by startup for  e-commerce  is called the  payment 
gateway  service.  Payment gateways  enable people to choose a  variety of  digital 
payment gateways  (digital payment gateways ) managed  by a number of  start -
ups,  thereby increasing  e-commerce  sales volume . Payment gateway  one of which is 
iPaymu .                
The proliferation of  online  businesses  today has begun to change people's habits 
in shopping.  No exception in the payment method.  Now, the public is offered a variety 
of digital -based payment methods ( digital payment gateways ) that are managed by a 
number of  start -ups. One of them is iPaymu.

2013, for example, iPaymu launched a Quick Response Code (QR Code) based 
payment solution.  With iPaymu solution, in addition to being able to 
make  online  transactions  faster, it is hoped that a sense of security, comfort and trust 
will be created betwee n buyers and sellers.  
The presence of the  QR Code -based  mobile payment  feature  is inseparable from 
one issue related to  online  shopping, namely payment system security. Although 
online  stores  already offer a method of payment with multiple layers of secur ity, 
doubt still surrounds a number of people with its security.       
So, with this service, iPaymu account holders can enjoy payment transactions, 
check balances, and withdraw cash orders directly from the cell phone quickly, safely, 
and comfortably.  This  service can also be an alternative device for payment of debit 
and credit card transactions with  Electronic Data Capture  (EDC) owned by banks in 
large companies.  In addition, iPaymu uses 256 bit SSL  encryption  and has been verified 
by Thawte. But, users s till have to maintain the confidentiality of the username and 
password  and are advised to change the  password  regularly to prevent misuse by 
unauthorized parties.           
To realize the speed, convenience, and security of the service, this startup has 
integrated its payment system with national and international banking networks and 
developed a payment system that guarantees the security and convenience of online 
transactions  via the internet or  mobile phone .    
All merchants  that have been certified by th is startup will get a "Safe Shopping" 
Certificate from iPaymu.  To get the certificate logo, the  merchant  must first apply 
for merchant  certification  to iPaymu.  In addition, this startup has also collaborated 
with more than 21 thousand ATM Bersama  networks,  Link, Prima, Alto, Visa, Master 
Card, and JCB.  Synergy is also carried out by iPaymu with Pos Indonesia.  Concretely, 
iPaymu users can withdraw money through the post office.  Not only that, now 
iPaymu also accepts transactions through PayPal.        
There a re three types of user accounts offered, namely Personal, Business, and 
Enterprise.  Interestingly, there are no monthly fees charged to users.  Registration for 
all three types of users is also free.  However, there are differences in withdrawing 
funds to a bank account.  In the Personal type, withdrawing funds to a bank account 
takes seven days.  In the type of business, the time required is three days.  Funds 
withdrawals to bank accounts in  real time  can be enjoyed by Enterprise users.  In order 
to enjoy real t ime services, users must  upgrade their  membership to a Business account 
with a minimum withdrawal of IDR 10 million or Enterprise with an unlimited 
number of withdrawals  (terms and conditions apply).  Other services that can be 
enjoyed by all three types of  user accounts include transfers between  users , bulk 
transfers, and sending bills.  Each transaction is subject to a fee of 1% for users who use 
eWallet Debits.  The percentage of transaction costs is greater if the user uses a credit 
card.  Funds withdrawal or transfer through eWallet Debit and post offices are also 
subject to fees that vary in amount.

Remittance is a type of startup that specifically provides international money transfer 
services.  Many of these startup  remittance  establishments  are in order to help people 
who don't have an account or access to banking.  The existence of this type of startup 
is very helpful for migrant workers or anyone who might be a member of his family 
abroad, because of the easy delive ry process and lower cost.  In Singapore, for example, 
stood a fintech startup named SingX.   Fintech startup in Singapore SingX Pte Ltd has 
launched  an online remittance platform  that is faster, safer, more convenient and cheaper 
for consumers than they usu ally pay when sending money abroad.    
The launch of the  online remittance  is supported by American Express Bank and 
DBS which aims to help consumers, small and medium businesses in order to save 
shipping costs by up to 90%.  SingX also offers transaction ad vantages transparently.    
SingX has launched the 2017 Singapore -India money transfer service  . since 
mid-January, which allows Singapore -based consumers to send their funds to India.  In 
the long run, SingX plans to expand  the money transfer  platform  from S ingapore to 
Malaysia, Hong Kong, Australia and other countries, where it also holds 
licenses.    Atul Garg, SingX CEO said that:  "SingX technology can serve  consumers in smarter, 
faster, smoother and cheaper ways.  They no longer need to queue at the bank or  fill out forms. 
"   SingX's  online remittance  platform is  quite simple and  user -friendly  . Customers can 
register an account on the company's website.  After document submission and face -
to-face verification, his account will be approved and he can start u sing this 
service.  The customer can send the amount of money he wants to send, to the SingX 
bank account, and the recipient will receive the money in his country within a few 
hours after the funds are received from the customer.  SingX is a subsidiary of Ea sy 
Transfer Pte Ltd, licensed by the Singapore Monetary Authority.  SingX also holds 
a remittance  license  in Hong Kong and Australia.

II. ACTS OF  MONEY LAUNDERING USING DIGITAL ASSET 
MEDIA  
A. Cases of Money Laundering Using Digital Assets Media  
 
The Center for Reporting and Analysis of Financial Transactions or 
PPATK  found  indications of the  flow of funds in  the crime  of money laundering  
through digital currenci es. Acting Director of PPATK Transaction Analysis, Danang 
Tri Hartono, who gave information to business tempo in central Jakarta Tuesday, 
December 19, 2019, said the indication was successfully traced because transactions 
in digital currencies were still c arried out by conventional banks.  indications of 
money laundering are from corruption to terrorism.  But he was not yet willing to 
specify which digital currency provider site he intended.  PPATK will continue to try 
its best to explore this indication.      
The Center for  Reporting  and Analysis of Financial Transactions (PPATK) 
considers the development of virtual money including Bitcoin to be potentially used 
for money laundering and financing of terrorism.  as a financial intelligence agency, 
PPATK has the a ttention and priority of tracking transactions that are allegedly 
related to money laundering and financing of terrorism by utilizing virtual money 
including Bitcoin.  
PPATK formed a  financial technology  (fintech) and  cybercrime  desk  , and increased 
coopera tion with members  of the National Coordinating Committee on Prevention 
and Eradication of Money Laundering (TPPU), namely  Bank Indonesia (BI), the  JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20          151

Published by Postgraduate Program, Master  of Laws , Faculty of Law, Uni versitas Negeri Semarang, Indonesia  Financial Services Authority (OJK), and Ministry of Trade (Ministry of 
Trade).  PPATK also supports BI's polic y as the payment system authority which is 
authorized to issue policies prohibiting the use of virtual money in processing 
payment transactions, as stipulated in Article 34 of Bank Indonesia Regulation (PBI) 
Number  18/40 / PBI / 2016 concerning the Impleme ntation of Payment Transaction 
Processing and Article 8 paragraph (2) PBI Number 19/12 / PBI / 2017 concerning the 
Implementation of Financial Technology.     
The step of the central bank to exercise its authority in accordance with the 
Law is considered as  a progressive effort from the perspective of preventing money 
laundering and terrorism financing.  Although it can be traced, it needs a very hard 
effort to detect identity, source of funds and the purpose of the transaction using 
virtual money.  Therefore,  PPATK as the authority in the field of prevention and 
eradication of the crime of money laundering and criminal acts of financing terrorism 
appealed to the public to be wiser in utilizing virtual money, including the use of 
Bitcoin and the like as digital  assets, especially in the context of investment 
( speculative investment purposes  ) . 
The presence of the internet brings convenience in carrying out daily activities, 
including money launderers.  Therefore, the term  cyber -laundering  then emerged  , whose 
definition is simply the practice of money laundering carried out in cyberspace, 
namely through online transactions.  In principle  cyber -laundering is the  same as the 
practice of conventional money laundering which consists of three stages:     
1. Placeme nt, placing dirty money into the legal financial system.  
2. Layering, transferring or changing the form of money through complex 
transactions to obscure the origin of funds.  
3. Integration, returning money that has been washed so that it can be used safely.  
It's just that online transactions offer a wide range, speed, convenience, and 
low costs for money launderers.  In any corner of the world, as long as there is internet 
access, money launderers can launch the action.  
According to laws on crypto -currency such as  Supervisory Board Commodity 
Futures Trading (Bappebti) finally issued Regulation No. 5 of 2019 on Technical 
Requirements Implementation of the Physical Markets Asset Crypto (Crypto Asset)

Based  on the  Financial Action Task Force  (FATF)  Report on Virtual 
Currencies Key Definitions and Potential AML/CFT Risks  Bitcoin is one of the new 
payment  methods (  NPM) which includes the use of i nternet -based payment services 
( Internet -Based Payment Services  ) is a digital representation of value that can be 
digitally traded and functions as: (1) a medium of exchange;  and / or  (2) a unit of 
account;  and / or (3) a store of value, but does not hav e a legal tender status (ie, when 
tendered to a creditor, is a valid and legal offer of payment) in any jurisdiction.  It is 
neither issued nor guaranteed by any jurisdiction, and fulfills the above functions only 
by agreement within the community of users.  Virtual currency is distinguished from 
fiat currency.  It is also distinct from e -money, which is a digital representation of fiat 
currency used to electronically transfer value denominated in fiat currency.      
Whereas based on Bank Indonesia Regulation N umber 18/40/PBI/2016 
concerning the Implementation of Payment Transaction Processing, the 
understanding of  virtual currency  is: digital money issued by parties other than 
monetary authorities obtained by means of  mining  , purchasing, or transfer 
of rewards  ( rewards  ) including Bitcoin , BlackCoin, Dash, Dogecoin, Litecoin, 
Namecoin, Nxt, Peercoin, Primecoin, Ripple, and Ven.  Not included in the definition 
of virtual currency  is electronic money.       
In addition, Bitcoin uses  blockchain  technology  that pro vides solutions to 
problems that exist in conducting transactions, which are not found in the financial 154           JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20

Published by Postgraduate Program, Master  of Laws , Faculty of Law, Universitas Negeri Semarang, Indonesia  industry.  Blockchain  technology  makes all financial transactions carried out in 
a ledger  (digital  ledger ) digitally and not managed by one particular or ganization or 
party.  This ledger record is distributed publicly and is managed by thousands of 
computers in the world at the same time, so everyone can know that a transaction has 
taken place and no one can oppose that fact.  These things cause Bitcoin to b e the most 
popular.    Allen & Overy, Virtual Currencies Mining the Possibilities, 2015. Bitcoin 
was only developed in 2009 by someone under the pseudonym  Satoshi Nakamoto  , so 
that the true identity of the founder of Bitcoin has never been known.    
Bitcoin is a  virtual web  currency  and is an interesting economic experiment 
where many people now use it to buy  real items  . Simply put, Bitcoin is cash on the 
internet, which does not require banks,  credit  cards  , fees, or fears of identity theft as 
is rife in the  online  world  . Some people call it  cash for the internet  . Bitcoin is the  latest 
digital  peer -to-peer  (P2P) currency that can be used to r eplace cash in  online  trading 
transactions (Bains, 2015).  
Unlike other  online  currencies  that are related to banks and use payment 
systems such as PayPal, Bitcoin  is directly distributed between users without the need 
for intermediaries.  Bitcoin combines cryptography and  peer -to-peer  architecture  to 
avoid oversight of financial authorities.  Thus, transactions using Bitcoin do not leave a 
trail because there is no n eed to pass  intermediary institutions such as banks. Bitcoin 
can be transferred to any country in the world if connected to the internet.  Bitcoin 
will be saved into a  bitcoin wallet . The wallet  application  must be  installed  on both 
parties' devices with personal computers  or laptops  , tablets or  smartphones  . After 
installing the wallet application, the user will get a  bitcoin address .           
At present, the use of Bitcoin is free to operate and has been used by many 
countries, both as a commodity and to  be equalized as a currency in conducting 
transactions.  However, Bitcoin is often misused by criminals to carry out criminal acts 
(Irwin, 2014).  
 
B. Bitcoin and Money Laundering in Indonesia  
 
In Indonesia, Bitcoin is widely used by business people in investin g and even because 
it is  pseudonym  (does not use real identity) and decentralized (there is no financial 
authority or third party who oversees and controls transactions) so that it is often 
used by criminals in committing criminal acts.  Like, money launder ing (a process in 
which the proceeds of crime are then transformed as if it were  net money or bought 
assets).  Terrorism funding (providing  funds for terrorist activities)  , and other 
criminal acts that use the Bitcoin media in transactions.  This is a probl em for a 
country in eradicating money laundering and financing of terrorism.    
Indeed there are no international rules or standards that apply globally related 
to virtual currencies , especially Bitcoin.  However, some countries are currently trying to 
regul ate virtual currencies  and there are also other countries, such as the United States, 
China, and Japan, which have regulated them.  Based on the recommendations of 
the Financial Action Task Force  (FATF) No. 15 it is regulated that each country is 
required t o make comprehensive rules regarding the  New Payment Method  (NPM)  JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20          155

Published by Postgraduate Program, Master  of Laws , Faculty of Law, Uni versitas Negeri Semarang, Indonesia  including  Internet -Based Payment Services  (FATF 2015) and each country is required to 
apply  a risk assessment  before establishing a related business NPM technology (FATF 
2012).  The need to l ook at policies or rules made by other countries and FATF 
recommendations is to find out what and how to regulate  virtual currency  in 
Indonesia.                
Regulations in force in Indonesia related to  virtual currencies  are only prohibited, 
which refers  to Bank Indonesia Regulation Number 18/40 / PBI / 2016 concerning the 
Implementation of Payment Transaction Processing.  Article 34 letter a of Bank 
Indonesia Regulation states that Payment System Service Providers (PJSPs) are 
prohibited from processing pa yment transactions using  virtual currency . In other words, 
Bank Indonesia (BI) does not prohibit the use of  virtual currency , but prohibits  PJSPs 
that have obtained licenses from BI to process payment transactions using  virtual 
currency  .       
The virtual currency , specifically Bitcoin, is not a legal payment instrument in 
Indonesia as regulated in Act Number 7 of 2011 concerning Currency and BI is not 
responsible for risks arising from the use of  virtual currency  by the public.  This 
regulation does  not regulate the risk of using  virtual currency  in criminal financing of 
terrorism and other criminal acts that use Bitcoin as a transaction medium so that it 
becomes a loophole for terrorists and other perpetrators to commit their crimes.        
In addition, Bank Indonesia Regulation Number 19/12 / PBI / 2017 concerning 
Financial Technology Implementation has also been issued.  In Article 8 paragraph (2) 
of this regulation it is stated that, "In addition to the obligations referred to in 
paragraph (1), Providers of Financial Technology are prohibited from carrying out 
payment system activities using  virtual currenc  ." Prohibition of conducting payment 
system activities using this  virtual currency  is due to  virtual currency  is not a legal 
payment ins trument in Indonesia  
There is already a  Bitcoin Exchange  in Indonesia which is an  intermediary  between 
buyers and sellers of Bitcoin that can make  online  transactions  through the 
indodax.com site (previously: bitcoin.co.id) and allows someone to withdraw r upiah 
from their  bitcoin wallet  account  . Bitcoin Exchange  in Indonesia provides Bitcoin 
exchange services in rupiah, and vice versa, although there are no rules that regulate it 
so that it becomes an attraction for terrorists and other perpetrators in fun ding 
terrorism and other criminal acts.  In addition, its  pseudonym  and borderless transaction  are 
of particular interest because terrorists can transfer Bitcoin across countries easily and 
quickly without being able to trace their identity.              
Seeing this fact, if it is not a concern of the government in terms of regulations, 
it will be difficult to eradicate funding of terrorism and other crimes because they 
freely use the internet network used by the  Bitcoin Exchange  and Bitcoin trading websites  to 
commit crimes and there is no obligation for  BitcoinExchange  to report any suspicious 
transactions and there is no obligation to implement  Know Your Customer  (KYC).  So, as 
long as the Indonesian government does not recognize the existence of Bitcoin, th e 
application of KYC has no meaning as long as it has not been regulated by the 
authorities in Indonesia.           156           JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20

Published by Postgraduate Program, Master  of Laws , Faculty of Law, Universitas Negeri Semarang, Indonesia  There have been a number of cases that have occurred in Indonesia related to 
the use of Bitcoin as a tool for committing crimes, namely narco tics and terrorism.  The 
use of Bitcoin to launch criminal financing for terrorism has been a concern for a long 
time by law enforcers around the world.  Moreover, since the ISIS ( Islamic State of Iraq 
and Syria ) uprising  in Syria many Bitcoin transactions a re used by ISIS groups to  fund 
acts of terrorism  . Bitcoin is also widely used by terrorists as a transfer media t o fund 
terrorist activities in Indonesia and to fund foreign terrorists who want to join ISIS.    
Examples of terrorism cases related to Bitcoin that have been decided by the 
Tangerang District Court in  2016 are in the name of Leopard Wisnu Kumala, a 
suspected bomber in Mal Alam Sutera, who blackmailed mall managers with  money 
requests  in the form of Bitcoin.  He sent an  e-mail  to the mall manager to ask for money 
in the amount of  Rp300 million in the form of Bitcoin.  Because the mall manager only 
sent a small  portion of b itcoin to the suspect's account then the suspect blew up Mal 
Alam Sutera.      
With such a mode, it is feared that it will become a trend of further threats 
from other terrorists and then the results of the transfer of Bitcoin to terrorists will be 
used to fund acts of terrorism in Indonesia, such as carrying out bombings in 
Indonesian territory or other terrorist activities.  This is a mechanism for funding 
terrorism through  self-funded  fundraising  .   
Recently the Minister of Trade issued Regulation of the Minister of Trade No. 
99 of 2018 concerning General Policy for the Implementation of  Crypto Asset  . With the 
existence of these rules, then bitcoin and other virtual currencies are commodities 
worth trading as subjects of Indonesian futures contracts on th e Futures 
Exchange.  However, is this regulation sufficient to overcome the current situation, 
where criminals use bitcoin and other virtual currencies to carry out their crimes?   
The absence of legislation in force in Indonesia related to  virtual currencie s such 
as Bitcoin will provide a loophole for perpetrators of crime in committing crimes.  The 
prohibition on using  virtual currency  in Indonesia only causes problems and does not 
support efforts to prevent and eradicate criminal acts such as terrorism and 
narcotics.       
In addition, the prohibition of Bitcoin in Indonesia has caused economic losses 
because domestic investors will buy digital assets abroad that have legalized Bitcoin 
transactions.  Finally, many domestic assets flow to other countries.  Techn ology 
continues to develop and cannot be avoided.  When referring to the  principle of neutrality 
of e -commerce technology  that applies globally, technology can be used for useful 
purposes as well as for committing criminal acts.  That is, the technology itse lf is 
innocent, the guilty are individuals who use the technology for illegal activities.     
Thus, the  government  needs attention  in terms of  virtual currency  regulation  so 
that the government can monitor as well as obtain digital money transaction data 
which will later be used to prevent and minimize acts of terrorism and narcotics as 
well as other financial related crimes.  In addition, the government can also prepare to 
face the development of financial technology in the future.

LAUNDERING CRIME  
 
If previously the money laundering mode was developed through splitting funds into a 
number of bank accounts, now as various new business models grow such as  peer to 
peer lending,  online loans, buying and selling online investments, online insurance 
policies, the mode of smuggling illicit funds originating from  predicate crime  has great 
potential to target the  financial technology  (fintech) sector, especially  fintech  which is not 
registered with state authority (il legal fintech).          
Anticipating various modes of money laundering, the  Financial Action Task 
Force  (FATF) has issued 40 recommendations related to international standards in the 
area of money laundering and financing of terrorism adopted by the majo rity of world 
jurisdictions through the supervision of FATF - style Regional Bodies (FSRBs)  . FSRBs for 
countries in the Asia Pacific region are handled by the  Asia Pacific Group on Money 
Laundering  (APG).   APG is tasked with evaluating compliance with the fulfillment of 
40 FATF recommendations for members, both in terms of  technical compliance 
assessment  and asset effectiveness  through  mutual evaluation reviews  (MER) of members every 
4 years.  Indonesia itself has been a member of the APG since 1999.    
In the 2017 -2018 range,  Indonesia has shown quite good results with 
improved  ratings  obtained for 2 (two) Recommendations, namely Recommendation 4 
regarding  the legal framework for  confiscat ion and seizure of assets and 
Recommendation  8 regarding the  legal framework for non -profit organizations , and 2 
(two)  Immediate Outcome (IO)  , namely IO2 related to the effectiveness of 
international cooperation and IO8 related to the effectiveness  of confiscation and 
seizure of assets.         
To note, the legal ba sis for implementing anti -money laundering and 
preventing terrorism financing (PPT) in Indonesia is contained in several regulations 
such as  Law No.8 Year 2010  concerning Prevention and Eradication of Money 
Launderi ng (TPPU)  Act , Law No.9 Year 2013  concerning Prevention and Eradication 
of Terrorism Funding Crime (TPPT),  PP No.43 of 2015  concerning Reporting Parties 
in PPTPPU and  POJK No.  12 of 2017  concerning the Implementation of the PPT APU 
Program in the FSS.  Specifically  fintech  P2P lending , its specific arrangement in relation 
to anti money laundering regulations refers to POJK No.  12 of 2017. It's just that, for 
reasons of time adjustment, the POJK only came into force in the coming year 
2021.           
Referring to Article 1  a quo  POJK  , the fintech industry which is an information 
technology lending and borrowing service provider is categorized as a Financial 
Services Provider (PJK) in the non -bank financial industry sector.  Consequently, 
Fintech (PJK) must identify, assess and understand the risks of TPPU and / or TPPT 
related to customers, countries or geographical areas, products, services, transactions 
or distribution networks.    158           JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20

Published by Postgraduate Program, Master  of Laws , Faculty of Law, Universitas Negeri Semarang, Indonesia  In addition, the fintech industry will also be required to document TPP U / 
TPPT risk assessments;  consider all  relevant risk factors before determining the 
overall level of risk, as well as the level and type of risk mitigation sufficient to be 
applied;  updating risk assessments regularly;  and has an adequate mechanism relate d 
to providing risk assessment information to the authorized agencies.   
  
A. CDD or EDD Obligations  
 
Analyst Senior Executive in Functional Quality Control and Monitoring Supervision 
Sector -Group Handling APU PPT Financial Services Authority (FSA), Dewi 
Fadjarsarie Handajani, explained that there are several divisions obligation execution 
due diligence  customer  by the bank  fintech,  the CDD (  customer due  diligence) in a simple 
and EDD (  enhance due diligence  ). Simple CDD, must be  fintech  PJK for low -risk 
customers TPPU / TPPT, while EDD must be done for high -risk customers / 
customers.    The CDD and EDD p rocesses are included in the APU PPT 
implementation scheme as stipulated in POJK No.  12 of 2017 concerning the 
Implementation of the PPT APU Program in the FSS.  It is important to note, Dewi 
said that the implementation of the PPT APU obligation specifical ly for P2P Lending 
fintech will only take e ffect in the coming year 2021.  The CDD process includes 
identification, verification and monitoring by the PJK to ensure the transaction is in 
accordance with the profile, characteristics and / or transaction patterns of 
Prospective Customers, Customers or WIC.  Whereas EDD is a more in -depth CDD 
action undertaken by  PJKs against high -risk pro spective customers/clients/ WIC such 
as having background, identity and history that are considered high risk of conducting 
TPPU and / or PEP, including  Political Expose Person  (PEP).   For example, to conduct 
EDD, PJK can create a customer profile.  From that profile, PJK must know the funding 
portfolio of both lenders and debtors.  Not just the background / identit y of lenders 
and debtors, PJK also needs to make a  range of  transactions.  For ranges  below Rp. 50 
million, for example, they are classified as  low risk  transactions  so there is no need to 
get extra supervision.  If transactions in the range of Rp 50 million  to Rp 500 million 
are categorized as medium risk, while  high risk  that requires extra strict and 
important supervision by EDD is in the range of transactions above Rp 500 
million.           
Furthermore, the risk also depends on the nominal, then monitoring  is done 
afterwards.  There it can be seen that what is called the  risk base approach  is not 
necessarily beaten all flat.  It can be seen i n accordance with the profile.  In addition  to 
the nominal transaction value  , the high risk  AML  category  can also be seen from the 
size of the company, the fo rm of the company (foundation/cooperative/limited 
company ), customer profile, regional location, the field of corporate services to 
the Beneficial Owner  (actual beneficial  owner / BO) of the co rporation .           
A clear example,  foundation customers are considered to be at higher risk of 
being exposed to TPPU /TPPT if affiliated with NGOs engaged in activities related to 
radicalism, otherwise if the foundation is engaged in education the risk is 
moderate.  Another example, large companies with more employees, subsidiaries  JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20          159

Published by Postgraduate Program, Master  of Laws , Faculty of Law, Uni versitas Negeri Semarang, Indonesia  spread across several regions and have a more  sophisticated  transaction system  can also 
be categorized as  high risk  AML  .    
Each OJK supervisor, will make an individual risk assessment of all PJKs and 
do a mapping related to the level of  transaction risk  safety  in all of these lines.  When 
the tr ansaction category is in the form of a  high risk  AML  , OJK will conduct PPT APU 
checks every year.  For AML the  middle risk  category  , the inspection is conducted every 
2 years, while for  low risk  in the range of 3 years.          
With regard to  foreign  PEPs  , in addition to implementing CDD, the PJK 
fintech also needs to conduct EDD periodically, at least by analyzing information 
about customers or  beneficial owners  , sources of funds and sources of wealth.  Even if 
CHD fintech business relations or transacti ons originating from High -risk countries 
published by the FATF, it is important take preventive measures ( countermeasures  ). 
There, PJK is not only required to do EDD, but also must ask for confirmation and 
clarification from the competent authority.   
 
B. Not Required To  Report TKM  
 
The obligation to  report  suspicious financial transactions (TKM) by  fintech  P2P 
Lending to the  Financial Intelligence Unit  (FIU), namely PPATK, has yet to be 
regulated.  Supposedly, said Dewi, PJK fintech P2P was also required to  report to 
PPATK, only then was PPATK and law enforcement officers working and ascertained 
whether in a TKM the TPPU and TPPT practices were actually carried out.  The 
importance of reporting TKM to PPATK, he said because OJK only functions as a 
supervisor who ensures that PJK fintech has implemented APU PPT properly.     
When referring to the definition of PJK in Article 1 paragraph (4) Perka PPATK 
No. PER -09 / 1.02.2 / PPATK / 09/12 concerning Procedures for Submitting Suspicious 
Financial Transaction Repor ts and Cash Financial Transaction Reports for Financial 
Service Providers Customers, indeed P2P Lending is not included in the PJK category 
which is required to report TKM based on the  a quo  PPATK Perka  , only the 
fintech  payment gateway  entity  is regulate d . Although there is no P2P obligation as a 
reporter, there is still no obstacle for the public to report to PPATK.      
When confirmed, the Head of PPATK Ki Agus Ahmad Badaruddin said his 
party was still in the process of reviewing the reporting obligatio ns of TKM by fintech 
P2P Lending to PPATK.  "There is no regulation about Tkm to PATPK.   
  
C. Illegal Fintech and Money Laundering  
 
To note , Indonesia through the Financial Services Authority (FSA) has now stopped 
the operation of 803  illegal fintech  entities . So far, Dewi also mentioned that sanctions 
obtained  by illegal fintechs were  indeed limited to stopping company activities such as 
blocking in collaboration with the Ministry of Information and Communication 
(Communication and Information). While the Uni ted States (US) did not even 
hesitate to take legal action against  fintech  entities  that do not comply with 160           JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20

Published by Postgraduate Program, Master  of Laws , Faculty of Law, Universitas Negeri Semarang, Indonesia  federal  Anti -Money Laundering  (AML)  provisions.  The action was taken through the US 
financial audit authority,  the Financial Crimes Enforcement Netw ork (FinCEN) which is 
under the Ministry of Finance.        
The  first  Fintech  said to have to deal with US AML law enforcement in the form 
of fines worth US $ 700 thousand, namely Ripple Labs.  Ripple Labs at that time 
carried out its activities without bein g legally  registered  . So firmly the US law provides 
sanctions against  illegal fintech in  line with the high awareness of the US authorities 
about the dangers of the circulation of funds from money laundering in 
the fintech  industry  . If registered, it is clear that it will make it easier for FinCEN to 
detect sources and inflows of funds in and out, so that the money supply chain from 
TPPU can be easily broken.         
TPPU expert, Yenti Ganarsih, said that any industry based on digital 
technology would inde ed be very vulnerable to being a means of money laundering if 
the government control function did not go well.  In the politics of anti -money 
laundering law, all business activities that can raise funds and enter capital must be 
applied to reporting obligat ions.  If technically the transfer of funds is done through a 
bank, the bank should automatically be obliged to report the transaction to PPATK if 
the transaction value is above Rp 500 million.  
It is a problem, he said, if P2P Lending does not cooperate with the Bank in 
conducting transactions, so PPATK will have difficulty  sniffing out  indications of AML 
violations because it does not get reports from the Bank.  Conversely, the origins of 
large amounts of transactions thought to originate from p roceeds of crime can be 
easily tracked by the formal system of government through reporting 
obligations.  Finally, through its data, authorities can track the source of the flow of 
funds more quickly and efficiently.    
 The Chairperson of the OJK Investment  Alert Task Force, Tongam Lumban 
Tobing, reminded that all  P2P Lending  fintechs  were required to register their company 
in the OJK in accordance with POJK No.  77 / POJK.01 / 2016 concerning Information 
Technology -Based Money Lending and Borrowing Services.  The reason for the 
compulsory registration is called Tongam, which cannot be separated from fears of the 
tearing of TPPU / TPPT practices in the fintech industry.  If it is not registered with 
the OJK, he said, financial statements related to fintech fundi ng sources will be 
difficult to trace.    
The Task Force's steps to anticipate this, the Task Force announced to the 
public that the community does not participate  in illegal fintech  activities  as well as 
blocking related to illegal fintech sites or applica tions through the Ministry of 
Communication and Information.  After that, Tongam said that his party would 
submit information related to the TPPU's indication to law enforcement.    
Regarding sanctions, there are no specific criminal provisions governing the  
matter of fintech.  So that when a crime occurs, he explains that the sanctions are still 
included in the category of general criminal offenses that are snared using the 
Criminal Code, be it fraud fraud.  If the billing is disturbing then it can be included  in 
the snare of unpleasant acts or even can be sanctioned using the provisions of the ITE 
Law.   JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20          161

Published by Postgraduate Program, Master  of Laws , Faculty of Law, Uni versitas Negeri Semarang, Indonesia  Bank Indonesia (BI) prohibits the use of virtual currencies like  Bitcoin  as a 
means of payment.  In its policy, other than rupiah, there is no other legal currency as 
a means of payment.  Responding to this, the CEO of Bitcoin  Indonesia, Oscar 
Darmawan said that his company strongly supports BI's policies.  Oscar also said 
that his company agreed that transactions in Indonesia must use Rupiah.    
Quoted from Indoprimer that the last few years, we often hear about 
cryptocurrency o r known as digital currency.  Cryptocurrency is a technology 
making digital currencies that uses cryptography for security that makes it, so it 
cannot be falsified.  Over time, this technology is increasingly popular and continues 
to be developed by various companies and teams of experts in various parts of the 
world to be able to cause a 'hot fund' raising trend where a start -up generates 
millions of dollars in capital by issuing virtual tokens to investors in exchange for 
money.  The company offers digital t okens (ICOs) that can be used to pay for goods 
and services on their platforms or saved as investments using blockchain technology, 
create whitepapers as platforms, software or products they want to build, then 
people buy these tokens using crypto received  broadly (like bitcoin) or fiat 
currencies for example USD.  
In cyrptocurrency, the price value is determined by the 'buy and sell' power of 
the users of this technology, meaning that we can buy at low prices and sell at high 
prices or buy when there is an opportunity to rise and sell when prices are higher 
than the purchase price.  But because the basic value of cryptocurrency is purely 
based on the strength of 'buy and sell' and the absence of supervision from the 
relevant financial departments and clear le gal rules, it is not uncommon for 
cryptocurrency to have a value of more than 20% down in a trading day that is 
actually used to make a profit.  According to Smith + Crown, a blockchain research 
and consultancy group, said that start -ups have raised more th an one billion dollars 
this year in coin sales and in recent months, only four crypto projects have raised 
more than $ 660 million combined.  Since the birth of bitcoin digital currency and 
blockchain technology in 2008, the two jargons have been quite cont roversial, due to 
their pseudonym, decentralized and encrypted nature, making it difficult to track 
every transaction made, and the individuals behind it.  In addition, cryptocurrency 
uses peer -to-peer technology so that the process of sending money is fast er, cheaper, 
more extensive and safer than using ordinary banking services, especially utilizing 
Western Union services.  Theoretically, anyone who has an internet connection and 
a digital wallet can be part of a coin sales event.  
But the ease with which th is technology is triggered concerns for many 
because it can be used as a money laundering facility or to fund terrorist activities 
and engage in other fraudulent behavior - especially in countries where corruption is 
rampant.  On August 1, the Singapore Mon etary Authority (MAS) as the financial 
regulatory body and Singapore's central bank said in a newspaper that the ICO "is 
vulnerable to the risk of money laundering and terrorist risk because it is anonymous 
in conducting transactions, and concerns the ease  of large and fast amounts of 
money. go up in no time. Meanwhile, a legal entity in the United States, the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provides guidance on its website so 
that investors can consider before participating in the sale of digital tokens.  The SEC 162           JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20

Published by Postgraduate Program, Master  of Laws , Faculty of Law, Universitas Negeri Semarang, Indonesia  asks potential buyers to look carefully and identify investment schemes that are not 
true.  
Although terrorism financing is not uncommon in Asia Pacific compared to 
the Middle East or North Africa, experts told CNBC that crypto -essence money  
laundering was a major concern among the authorities.  To avoid fraud or money 
laundering, fundraising companies are asked to do customer due diligence, certify 
their identity and track their source of wealth and require companies to arrange 
their products , a process that is sometimes expensive according to Phillipps, who 
previously worked with Australian regulators Securities and Investments 
Commission.  Phillipps said ICO and cryptocurrency were only new avenues for old 
age problems: "People are endlessly looking for ways to avoid going through all the 
efforts of regulation, compliance and so on."  
Responding to concerns about cryptocurrency opportunities as a money 
laundering container, this blockchain -based system is actually considered to be 
uncomfortable  for 'unscrupulous individuals' who want to try to misuse because 
every digital token transaction is recorded permanently in a digital ledger that can 
be seen publicly, allowing investigators to track the person who has done a 
transaction and what matters related to their activities regarding the cooperation.  
To the CNBC, the experts also added that with the inclusion of ICO on a 
large scale, it means that there are now hundreds of obstacles that can be imitated 
by criminals.  At the same time, there have be en developments in exchanges that may 
have tended not to cooperate with the authorities. It has already recorded more than 
500 cryptocurrency created based on coinmarketcap.com.  Even Google Ventures 
also invests in one of these Cryptocurrency technologies.  Some cryptocurrency has a 
variety of different concepts and some have concepts that mimic other coins. Experts 
say the process on the ground makes ICO a perfect vehicle for money laundering, for 
example when Innocent Bob buys a digital token in the hope h e can sell his shop 
later at a higher price on the main exchange (which spends money to record 
customer information to match regulatory regulations), or he can switch to fly -by-
night exchanges where prices are better.  Prices are better on the second exchan ge 
because of money laundering candidates, Dirty Harry is willing to pay a premium to 
launder their funds.  Dirty Harry, who wanted to make his dirty money look clean, 
bought a digital token from Bob.  Then Bob makes more money than he has on a more 
regular exchange, and Harry now has digital tokens that are not related to criminal 
companies.  Harry can then go to any exchange and sell his digital tokens for digital 
currencies or general fiat according to the prevailing currency in the country.  
Alternatively, criminals could have bought the ICO themselves, hoping that 
novice technology would not have strong know -the-customer practices.  In order to 
track and prevent and protect investors from fraud, many argue that emergency 
crypto requires some form of regulati on - especially digital coins which sometimes 
act like securities but are not subject to strict main regulations. Seriously addressing 
the issue, late last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission released an 
investigative report that said companies  planning to use ledgers or buffering devices 
that could be used to raise capital should take appropriate steps to comply with US 
federal securities laws Union. The Singapore MAS also clarified this week that it  JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20          163

Published by Postgraduate Program, Master  of Laws , Faculty of Law, Uni versitas Negeri Semarang, Indonesia  would regulate the sale of digital tokens in t he city -state if the product is regulated 
in Singapore's securities and futures regulations. After regulatory oversight of the 
ICO, several sources told CNBC that the benefits would be seen cleanly.  Most agree 
that having the right rules can protect invest ors in the same way that is maintained 
in the securities market.  
Having the right regulations is expected to gain more traction, especially 
among retail investors.  This can be seen from the Data Tokens released by Smith + 
Crown, which show that in the firs t half of 2017, there were more sales than in 2016, 
with the number of fundraising increasing from month to month since March.  Data 
Tokens are another site that tracks future token sales, listing dozens of ICOs in the 
coming months.  
Kapron explained that, at present, to invest in ICO, people need to have some 
technical understanding and interest in this matter.  This is needed to buy ethereum 
or bitcoin and then invest in coin sales.  While the current environment is limited to 
a subset of investors, he said regulations would be very useful when investing in ICO 
so that it would be easier to invest and therefore more people would be involved 
without having to realize the risks or challenges behind several platforms.  
However, there are also many general critici sms made on the sale of tokens 
because it is believed that many beginners 'play' but do not have the experience or a 
decent business model.  In other words, there is a possibility that bigger businesses 
fail and investors cannot return their money.  In contr ast, in a venture fundraising 
round, investors consider the viability of a start -up business plan as an executive 
strategy before supporting it.  VC-supported founders are obliged to answer their 
investors.  
"Tokens are not dilutive, (usually) do not have vo ting rights, and have very few 
rights, if any, attached to them. They are not in debt, who enjoy mandatory 
payments in the event of failure, and also their equity. Give the privileges of some 
shareholders ordinary vis -a-vis preferred, "Justin Hall, princip al at the early stage 
Golden Gate Ventures venture capital, told CNBC.  
On the other hand, critics would call back investor protection to dispute the 
rules, he said, adding it might be difficult to reconcile the two parties.  Moreover, 
Hall said, given how n ew the technology was, many regulators still "did not fully 
understand this developing industry."  Implementing unplanned policies can be more 
dangerous than good, he said.  To be sure, the SEC and MAS have learned a lot of 
crypto -crypto.  MAS issued a notice  in early March 2014 saying that virtual 
currencies are not regulated, but that virtual currency intermediaries will be 
regulated for the risk of money laundering and the risk of terrorism. "  
That all, of course, raises the question of why someone is inter ested in buying 
an ICO that has been overlooked.  For most people, the answer is simple: They think 
there is money to be made. Tee, a veteran of the banking industry, explained to 
CNBC that a digital token is "a representation of contractual rights in an ea sily 
transferable form of media. If the rights associated with tokens fall into the latter 
category, most jurisdictions will consider it security, "regardless of whether the 
rights are digital tokens, written contracts or formal security such as stock or d ebt 
instruments," Tee said.  164           JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20

Published by Postgraduate Program, Master  of Laws , Faculty of Law, Universitas Negeri Semarang, Indonesia  At present, to overcome regulatory oversight, many ICOs prevent residents of 
the United States and Singapore from participating in the sale of their tokens - 
either by blocking internet protocol addresses from these locations or  by relying on 
self-declarations from participants.  But experts told CNBC that people could easily 
overcome it by using virtual private network connections to cover their locations or 
simply by asking third parties in different places to participate on the ir behalf.  
  
IV. PENAL POLICY IN THE HANDLING  OF DIGITAL ASSET -
BASED MONEY  LAUNDERING CRIME  
A. Current Criminal Law Policy towards Countering Money Laundering Crime  
 
The eradication  of money laundering in Indonesia has begun with Law No.  15 of 2002 
concerning Criminal Acts of Money Laundering.  The law has stated that the act of 
money laundering is a criminal offense.  The new thing about this law is the birth of a 
new institution called the Financial Transaction Reports and Analysis Center 
(PPATK).  Travel  Law No.  15 of 2002 a year later amended by Law No.  25 of 2003 
concerning Prevention and Eradication of Money Laundering (PPTPPU).  Lapse of 8 
years later, the Parliament passed Law No.  8 of 2010 concerning Prevention and 
Eradication of Money Laundering  (PPTPPU), Money Laundering cannot be separated 
from the formulation of criminal law.  Criminal law formulation policy is defined as an 
effort to make and formulate a good criminal law.  
This understanding can also be seen in the definition put forward by  Marc 
Ancel  which states that  penal policy  as a science as well as art which aims to enable 
positive legal regulations to be better formulated and to provide guidance not only to 
the legislators, but also to the courts that apply The law and also to the organ izers or 
executors of court decisions  (Nawawi Arief, 2008).  
The philosopher Aristotle states that " a supremacy of law will be far better than 
compared to the rule of rampant tyranny ". This translation reads, "it is more proper that law 
should govern than any of the citizens: upon the same principle, if it is advantageous 
to place the supreme power in some particular persons, they should be appointed to 
be only guardians, and the servants of the laws"(Aristotle, Politics).  
that in the legislative legis lation of the Government of Indonesia together with 
the House of Representatives in the context of handling  money laundering  crimes  has 
formed several legal products to deal with money laundering issues including Law 
Number 15 of 2002 which has been amende d by Law Number 25 of 2003 concerning 
Eradication of the Criminal Act of Laundering money, and last amended by Act No. 8 
of 2010. Crime   is a portrait of the concrete reality  of the development of the life 
of society, directly  or indirectly, or being sued  condition of society, that in social life 
there is undoubtedly potential vulnerability gap child birth deviant individuals. In 
society there are struggles of  interests that are not always  filled with the right path, 
meaning that there are ways that are not  right and  violate the law carried out by 
a person or group of people  to fulfill their interests  (Wahid & Labib, 2005).  
The threat of  transnational crime, transnational, has become one of  the world's 
main concerns.  Region  Southeast Asia or East Asia,  which  includes Indonesia as  JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20          165

Published by Postgraduate Program, Master  of Laws , Faculty of Law, Uni versitas Negeri Semarang, Indonesia  a whole relatively vulnerable to the threat of transnational crime,  such as money 
laundering activities of money laundering almost always involve banks because of the 
globalization of the banking system through the payment system, es pecially that of 
electronic equipment ( electronic funds transfer ), proceeds crimes which in general will 
flow in large numbers or even move beyond national borders by utilizing bank secrecy 
factors that are generally upheld by banks.  Likewise, not only the  legal aspects related 
to this crime, but also other non -legal aspects such as economic, political, and social 
culture.  Various crimes both committed by individuals and companies within national 
borders or across national borders are increasing.  The aforem entioned crimes are in 
the form of liquor trading, gambling, arms trafficking, corruption, and smuggling.  In 
order not to be easily traced by law enforcers regarding the origin of the crime funds, 
the perpetrators do not directly use the funds referred to but are attempted to 
disguise / hide the origin of these funds in the traditional way, for example through 
casinos, horse racing or entering these funds into the financial system or 
banking.  Efforts to conceal or disguise the origin of funds obtained from these 
criminal acts are known as  money laundering .  
At present the perpetrators of crimes have many choices about where and how 
they want the proceeds of crime to be seen as "clean" and "lawful".  The development of 
international banking technology that has  given way to the growth of local / regional 
banking networks into a global financial institution has provided opportunities 
for money laundering  actors  to utilize the service network which results in money from 
illegal transactions becoming legal in the b usiness world on international financial 
markets.  At present money laundering activities have crossed the jurisdiction's limits 
offering a high level of confidentiality or using a variety of financial mechanisms where 
money can 'move' through banks,  money transmitters  , business activities and can even 
be sent abroad so that it becomes  clean laundered money  . 
The crime of money laundering or  money laundering  is increasingly getting special 
attention from various groups ranging from the community, academics and state 
administrators who are not only on a national scale, but also regional and globalized 
through cooperation between countries.  This movement was triggered by the fact that 
nowadays  money laundering  crimes are rife, while most countries have not est ablished a 
legal system to combat or define them as crimes that must be eradicated.  Such a large 
negative impact on a country's economy, so that countries in the world and 
international organizations feel moved and motivated to draw more serious attention 
to the prevention and eradication of money laundering crimes, so that the creation of 
law enforcement.  Law enforcement in eradicating money laundering in Indonesia is 
still not optimal.  As the main problem in the matter of law enforcement and 
awareness, it  can be pointed out that there is a lack of a harmonious relationship 
between laws and regulations, law enforcement behavior, law enforcement facilities, 
and public expectations. As the development of perpetrators and types of crimes of 
money laundering is  not balanced with the human resources of the law enforcers, 
more and more  money laundering  cases  cannot be resolved and dealt with quickly and 
appropriately because of the lack of quality human resources from the law enforcers 
themselves. so that if there  is a new mode and type of crime for which there is no way 166           JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20

are inadequate in imposing  criminal  acts  which should be alleged to ensnare them, so 
that it is necessary to im prove the quality of law enforcers themselves to realize law 
enforcement officials professional.  
Improving the quality of law enforcement officers in the framework of the 
realization of professional law enforcement officers, realized through efforts:  
1. provi de opportunities for law enforcement officials to attend education and 
vocational training;  
2. organize education and training among fellow investigators in certain cases in 
order to obtain a common perception in handling criminal cases;  
3. collaboration with te rtiary institutions to provide education and training in order 
to increase the knowledge of the investigating apparatus related to the 
implementation of the task;  
4. develop a transparent and professional human resource management system;  
5. establish guidelines  and procedures for coaching members; and  
6. supervise the performance of law enforcement officers fairly.  
Improving coordination between law enforcement institutions in order to 
create synergistic cross -agency relations through:  
1. Mapping the problems that ari se related to cross -agency coordination;  
2. Increasing the formation of cooperation institutions between related agencies;  
3. Form a supervisory institution in charge of overseeing the implementation of the 
tasks of each institution;  
4. Integrating and synchronizing community services so that service mechanisms can 
run simply, quickly and without overlapping;  
5. Each agency meets periodically both formally and informally to discuss various 
problems that arise related to coordination problems as well as find ing solutions;  
6. Increasing discussion forums and meetings between law enforcement officials 
aimed at obtaining common ground in carrying out investigative tasks;  
7. Prepare MoU which contains cooperation and coordination across agencies 
related to law enforcem ent. Seek to establish and / or improve legislation related to 
law enforcement in order to realize legal certainty.  
In terms  of state financial interests, the PPATK is given authority by Law No.  8 
of 2010 concerning the Prevention and Eradication of Crimin al Acts of Money 
Laundering, to make a temporary stop or delay in transactions containing suspicious 
transactions.  The suspension or postponement is intended to save the state money 
that is suspected of being the result of  predicate crime  or to cut off the  operations of 
crime organizations to expand their crime networks.  
The policy of criminal law enforcement against the handling of money 
laundering in the context of criminal law reform in Indonesia can be started with the 
establishment of appropriate legal  products through the government and is endorsed 
by the House of Representatives so that Law Number 8 of 2010 is formed in addition 
to the products of money laundering crime when this has received special attention 
from various groups ranging from the comm unity, academia and state administrators 
who are not only on a national scale, but also regional and globalized through 
cooperation between countries so that requires the readiness of law enforcement  JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20          167

policies in  money laundering is the burden of reverse proof which is considered the 
most revolutionary policy  . 
Constraints faced in the application of criminal law enforcement policies 
against tackling money laundering in the context of reforming criminal law in 
Indonesia and how to overcome them.  The crime of money laundering is increasing 
and the effect is very large not only is a problem in the field of law enforcement, but 
also concerns the threat of national and intern ational security of a country, obstacles 
in dealing with money laundering in addition to investigator resources that are still 
very limited but also lack of coordination between law enforcement agencies, as well 
as legislation that overlaps and conflicts w ith one another.  
  
B. The Application  of Money Laundering Crimes from The Perspective  of 
The Money Laundering Act of 2010  
 
Law No. 8 of 2010 (UUTPPU) is a means to realize the expectations of many parties as 
a law to anticipate various patterns of crime that lead to money laundering 
activities.  As for who is being targeted in  This TPPU  Law  is to prevent and eradicate 
money laundering systems or processes in the form of  placement, layering  and 
integration.  Then because the main targets in money laundering activities are bank 
and non -bank financial institutions, the regulatory objectives of  the UUTPPU include 
the active roles of these institutions to anticipate money laundering crimes.  
              Bank and non -bank financial institutions are ide ntified in the regulation of 
UUTPPU with Financial Service Providers.  Financial Service Providers are defined as 
service providers in the financial sector or other services related to finance including 
but not limited to banks, financial institutions, secu rities companies, mutual fund 
managers, custodians, trustees, depository and settlement institutions, foreign 
exchange traders, pension funds, insurance companies and post offices.  Then many 
crime handling systems in this law are processed with special cri minal procedure law, 
because the legal principles are  lex specialis  . 
Article 68 of this Law stipulates that investigations, prosecutions and 
examinations are carried out based on the provisions of the Criminal Procedure 
Code, unless otherwise specified in  this Law.  From this arrangement it appears that 
lawmakers want the law to be adjusted more to the nature of the development of 
the problem  of money laundering  crimes    
Problems  are governed  by legislation other.  Thus it appears that this law does 
indeed h ave a  lex specialis  nature  and the principles in this law can be exceptions to the 
provisions of other laws based on the  lex specialis  derogate legi lex generalis 
principle                
Furthermore, crimes that are threatened against those who carry out t rials, 
assistance or conspiracy in money laundering are equated with criminal threats 
against criminal offenses that have been completed as regulated in article 3, article 4, 
and article 5 of the UUTPPU.  In other words the threat of sanctions that are 
thre atened in article 3, article 4, and article 5 from those contained in article 10 is not 
distinguished.  168           JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20

Published by Postgraduate Program, Master  of Laws , Faculty of Law, Universitas Negeri Semarang, Indonesia  The provisions in article 10 of this UUTPPU differ or deviate in principle from 
the provisions in the Criminal Code, because in articles 53 and 57 of the  Criminal 
Code stipulates that  qualifications for trial, assistance or conspiracy are distinguished 
from qualification from criminal acts that have been completed.  
In this UUTPPU INTRAC function becomes wider than sub  - earlier law 
which functions such as  : 
1. Prevention and eradication of money laundering.  
2. Management of data and information obtained by PPATK.  
3. Supervision of the reporting party's compliance.  
4. Analysis or examination of reports and information on financial transactions that 
indicate money laundering and / or other criminal acts.  With the existence of these 
functions, the PPATK's authority becomes  wider in order to carry out these 
functions.  
The act of blocking of the assets of a suspect or defendant can be carried out if 
the assets are know n or reasonably suspected to be the proceeds of crime.  Article 71 
UUTPPU determines that investigators, public prosecutors and judges are authorized 
to order Financial Service Providers to block the assets of every person that has been 
reported by PPATK to  investigators who are known or reasonably suspected to be the 
result of a criminal offense. In Article 73 of Law No.  8 of 2010 which is evidence in the 
examination are:  
1. evidence as referred to in the Criminal Procedure Code.  
2. other evidence in the form of information that is spoken, sent, received, or stored 
electronically with optical devices or similar devices such as optics and 
documents;  and 
3. documents as referred to in article 1 number 16  
  
The provisions in article 1 number 16 of Law No.  8 of 2010 are:  
 
"Documents are data, records or information that can be seen, read, and / or 
heard, which can be issued with or without the aid of a means, whether 
stated on paper, any physical object other than paper, or recorded 
electronically, including but not limit ed to:  
a. writing  , sound or image  
b. map, design, photograph or the like;  
c. letters, signs, numbers, symbols or perforations that have meaning or can be 
understood by people who are able to read or understand them. "  
  
Evidence used in the examination of a crime of money laundering according to 
article 73 of Law no.  8/2010 is indeed very diverse.  This is clearly a necessity in 
eradicating money laundering because the problem of money laundering is a very 
complex problem because of the mode  and the crime syst em practiced by money 
launderers has involved high -tech equipment.  
Unlike the Criminal Code, this UUTPPU determines the minimum and 
maximum criminal threats.  We can see this, among others, in article 3, article 4,  JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20          169 
 
© Au thor(s). This work is licensed under a  Creative Commons Attribution -NonCommercial -ShareAlike 4.0 International License . 
Published by Postgraduate Program, Master  of Laws , Faculty of Law, Uni versitas Negeri Semarang, Indonesia  article 5, and article 7 of this law which  sets the threat of imprisonment for a 
minimum of 5 years and a maximum of 20 years and  a minimum fine of 
Rp. 1,000,000,000 (one billion rupiah) and a maximum of Rp.  100,000,000,000  (one 
hundred billion rupiah).  
The specificity  of criminal procedure law us ed by Law no.  8 of 2010 is the 
implementation of the justice system  in absentia . Justice  in absentia  is justice done by a 
court decision in which the defendant was not present although it has been 
summoned legally in accordance with applicable regulations.  
The regulation of the judicial system  in absentia  regulated in article 79 of the 
Law on Laws is aimed at making the judiciary run smoothly even without the 
presence of the accused.  Another objective is to save property from the proceeds of 
crime committed  by the defendant. Law No.8  of 2010 also adopts a reverse proof 
system, in which the defendant himself is required to prove his innocence.  The 
provisions in article 77 state: "For the purpose of examining the court, the defendant must prove 
that his assets  are not the result of a criminal offense."  
In article 79 paragraph (4) of Law No.8 Year 2010 it is stated that if a defendant 
dies before a judge's decision is handed down, where there is convincing evidence that 
the accused committed the crime, then the judge can make a determination regarding 
the assets of the defendant that has been confiscated to be seized and owned by the 
state.  The provisions of article 79 paragraph (4) are very contrary to the principle of 
the presumption of  innocence,  where a perso n cannot be found guilty before a judge's 
decision states that he is guilty of the charges charged with him.  
In contrast to Law No.15 of 2002, in Law No.25 of 2003 there are articles that 
explain the meaning of money laundering, whereas in Law No.  8 of 201 0 the 
definition of Money Laundering was expanded again to read "Money Laundering is 
all acts that meet the elements of criminal acts in accordance with the provisions in 
this Law".  In Law No. 15 of 2002, the notion of money laundering is not explicitly 
explained but only given its categorical meaning (in article 2 of Law No. 15 of 
2002).  The meaning of money laundering as explained in article 1 paragraph (1) of 
Law No.25 of 2003 is:  
 
"The  act of placing, transferring, paying, spending,  granting, donating, 
depositing, bringing abroad, exchanging, or other acts of assets that are 
known to be or suspected to be the result of a criminal offense with the 
intent to conceal or disguise the origin of the assets so that as if it were a 
legitimate asset  . " 
  
In Arti cle 2 of Law No. 8 of 2010 is set on the types of criminal offenses  
the results of these actions are assets as referred to in Law No.8 of 2010. This is a 
unique feature of the Money Laundering Law, because this crime is related to other 
criminal acts refer red to as  predicate offences.  As stated in article 2 of Law No.8 of 2010 
are: Results of Criminal Acts are Assets obtained from criminal acts, corruption, 
bribery narcotics,  psychotropics,  labor smuggling  , migrant smuggling  , in the 
banking sector,  in the  capital market,  in the insurance sector, customs, excise, 170           JOURNAL OF LAW & LEGAL REFORM  VOLUME 1(1) 20 20

Published by Postgraduate Program, Master  of Laws , Faculty of Law, Universitas Negeri Semarang, Indonesia  There are two PPATK tasks that are very prominent in  relation to efforts to 
prevent and eradicate money laundering in Indonesia.  The first task is to detect the 
occurrence of money laundering, and the second is the task to assist law enforcement 
related to money laundering and  predicate crimes . In carrying out its duties as an 
independent institution that aims to prevent and eradicate money laundering 
activities in Indonesia, PPATK will cooperate with many parties.  In addition to the 
police and prosecutors as law enforcement agencies who are authorized to co nduct 
investigations and prosecutions in money laundering, PPATK will also collaborate 
with Bank Indonesia, the Director General of Taxes, the Director General of Customs 
and Excise, the Capital Market Supervisory Agency, the  Ministry of Finance, the 
publi c and other institutions both from within and outside the country.  Seeing so 
many parties involved in the effort to prevent and eradicate money laundering, it can 
be realized that money laundering is a very dangerous threat that requires cooperation 
from m any parties to be able to deal with it.  
  
CONCLUSION  
 
The research concluded and highlighted that in order to optimize the results of the 
research in this paper a number of suggestions are put forward to increase concrete 
efforts in the politics of criminal law against the handling of digital asset -based money 
laundering. The development of information technology that is developing now, 
especially in the field of digital assets is able to become an opportunity for money 
laundering.  The case of committing the crime of money laundering is carried out using 
the digital currency -based information technology method and can be used for cross -
country trade.  So that the crime of money laundering based on digital assets is very 
easy to do and c an have a worldwide network. Whereas in the case of the crime of 
money laundering currently regulated as in Law No. 8 of 2010 concerning TPPU, it is 
felt to be highly irrelevant, because basically digital assets in Indonesia have no 
regulations yet.  
That p olitics is a legal product, which in this case digital assets using 
Blockchain technology based on information technology has been very fast developing 
in developed countries there are already their own authorities.  Because the velocity of 
money is so extr aordinary that it will have an impact on the country.  Digital assets 
should have been made in legislation in order to obtain certainty, usefulness and 
fairness to their users, and not to use them for money laundering
