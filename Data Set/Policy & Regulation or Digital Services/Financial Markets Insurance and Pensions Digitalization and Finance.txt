Foreword  
Technology and digitalisation are  rapidly transforming the way in which  the financial 
sector is operating . Innovative applications of digital technology for fina ncial services, or 
Fintech , are being used to alter the interface between financial consumers and service 
providers and are helping to improve communication with consumers and increase their 
engagement . 
This publication compiles a series of articles that focus on the impact of digitalisation and 
technology in the areas of financial markets, insurance, and private pensions. It also 
discusses the tools and policies needed to ensure that the challenges pose d by 
digitalisation result in better outcomes and better management of the risks involved.  
The first article provides a framework to help financial regulators understand the 
developments in financial markets being driven by digital technologies and innovat ion. It 
does so by making a clear distinction between the underlying technologies and their 
applications to financial services. It also addresses how these developments are affecting 
the various aspects of the financial landscape, and the implications this  may have for 
financial markets.  
Technology and digitalisation, and their related applications are also affecting the 
management and delivery of insurance and pensions. These developments are the focus of 
the second and third articles, which respectively c over digitalisation in pensions and the 
insurance sector. The second article provides an overview of how digital technology is 
being used to improve pension design and delivery , and how regulators are managing the 
changes  involved. Innovation hubs and regu latory sandboxes are emerging as key 
components of governments' efforts to support the development of Fintech  and help new 
businesses understand how existing regulation applies to their ideas.  
The third article examines the various ways in which technolog y and innovation  are 
affecting  the insurance sector , and where regulation and legal developments are , in turn,  
having feedback effects on digitalisation . The article concludes with some insights into 
how these developments could affect the future of the in surance sector . The use of 
regulatory platforms to allow innovative technologies to enter the insurance market brings 
many benefits (e.g . more customised insurance coverage to more people), but digital 
offerings need to satisfy the requirements of insurance regulations as well as wider data 
protection and cyber security considerations. The implications of using big data and 
algorithms need to be carefully assessed.  
The final two articles focus on concrete examples of the application of technology an d 
digitalisation, and discuss the benefits, risks and challenges that digital technology and its 
applications bring. The fourth article provides an overview of the types of robo -advisor 
that are now available. The robo -advice model has emerged as one poten tial solution to 
the need to increase the accessibility and affordability of advice and support for 
individuals seeking to invest savings for retirement. But these models also pose risks as 
they challenge traditional distribution channels, and are rapidly gaining market share in 4 │  FOREWORD

      terms of assets under management. Policy makers need to ensure that existing legislation 
applies with respect to the applicability of duty of care requirements, avoidance of 
conflicts of interest, transparency of disclosure and acce ss to redress in the case of an 
unfair outcome for the consumer. Moreover, regulators and supervisors may need to have 
processes in place to ensure that the algorithms that these platforms use are accurate and 
robust.  
The final article focuses on another e xample of the application of digital technology to 
finance, in this case the open application programming inter face (API)  in banking. It 
looks at the creation of open API standards in banking and explores the competition 
problems that API standards in bank ing address. It argues that by fundamentally changing 
the way in which consumers buy and use banking services this method represents the 
development of a more entrepreneurial approach to remedying malfunctioning markets. 
The article also underlines the imp ortance of competition authorities having the ability to 
investigate market failures on the demand side and to take action to resolve those failures, 
and notes that these remedies may have consequences for other markets where consumers 
lack property rights  over the data that is collected about their behaviour.

 1. Framework for digitali sation in finance  
This article presents a framework to help financial regulators understand the 
developments in financial markets that are being driven by digital technologies and 
innovation. The framework makes a clear distinction between these underlying 
technologies and thei r applications to financial services. The article then discusses how 
these developments are impacting the various aspects of the financial landscape, and the 
implications this may have for financial markets.

FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   1.  Introduction  
This article  seeks to provide a f ramework to help identify the various issues that emerging 
technologies and digitalisation present for financial markets . The framework  cover s several 
new and emerging digital technologies , including distributed ledger technology, Big Data, 
the Internet of  Things (IoT), cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), biometric 
technologies and augmented/virtual reality. In the article , these technologies are linked to 
such applications  as payments, planning, lending and funding, trading and investment, 
insur ance, security, operations, and communications. The article  then notes that the new 
and emerging technologies and their applications to financial services have the potential to 
influence numerous aspects  of the financial landscape, including new business m odels and 
product designs, competition, operational efficiencies, intermediation, accessibility, 
consumer engagement, speed, automation, analytics, privacy and transparency, and digital 
security risk.  
The article incorporates material obtained from OECD work over the past several years 
on a range of related topics, including innovation  in financial services, financial 
institution and market restructuring , and competition in financial services . It comple ments 
the tri -partite framework of digital technologies, applications, and aspects with additional 
material to separate the aspects impacted by the developments related to digitalisation of 
financial services from the implications of these developments.  
The paper proceeds as follows: The next section seeks to describe  what the Fintech  
revolution is all about. It does so by first taking a look  at technological innovations in 
finance over a longer time span  and at previous work assessing their impacts . This 
theoretical backdrop suggests relevant questions to ask in assessing the potential effects 
of new Fintech  innovations. The paper  then looks at alternative definitions of Fintech  
developments that have been put forward and at analytical frameworks that have been 
developed to examine the Fintech  phenomenon.  
The section following the definition of Fintech  looks at the digital technologies involved 
in these innovations. It is followed by a consideration of the most notable applications of 
new technologies. Keeping with the framework developed in the previous article, the 
succeeding section discusses the asp ects of financial services being affected by these 
technologies.  
While the article does not seek to draw definitive conclusions, it does explore the 
potential structural implications of these developments. The OECD, along with other 
international organisa tions and individual governments, are fully engaged in assessing the 
implications of technology -driven changes in the financial landscape and determining the 
appropriate policy responses needed to address these changes.   
2.  What is ' Fintech '? 
To help clarify the Fintech  phenomenon this article takes a step back in time to recall that 
technology -driven innovation in the financial services sector is not new. Rather, 
developments that are now being brought together under the umbrella label “ Fintech ” are 
the most recent evolution of a process of structural development that links back to the 
liberalisation of entry and ownership restrictions in the financial services sector in the 
1980s and 1990s. Those restrictions, along with interest -rate controls and credit allo cation 
guidelines had succeeded in limiting competition between banking institutions and 
between the banking sector and other types of financial business, as a means of 1. FRAMEWORK FOR DIGITA LISATION IN FINANCE  │ 9 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 preserving safety as the overarching policy objective. But they left these institutions  with 
limited financial resilience, owing to regulation -induced distortions in the allocation and 
pricing of credit, and vulnerable to competitive inroads by entities not subject to the 
restrictions. It was in part owing to the success of the threat to reg ulated institutions that 
the reform effort was introduced. Among other developments, the reforms enlarged the 
set of activities and lines of business in which institutions could engage and also allowed 
for much broader participation in the provision of fin ancial services.  
In retrospect, it is the combined effects of deregulation and technology that helped to spur 
institutional change.1 This was noted, for example, in the “Report on Consolidation in the 
Financial Sector”, which was published by the Group of Ten in 2001. The study cited 
technological change as one of the major driving forces behind the wave of consolidation 
(mergers, acquisitions, and strategic alliances) then taking place in the financial sector. 
The Group of Ten report drew the general concl usion that technological advances had 
altered the competitive functioning of the financial sector at both the production and the 
distribution levels, which among other effects had resulted in a need for service providers 
to find new sources of output effic iencies.2  
In the Group of Ten’s overall assessment, information technology, along with 
deregulation of product offerings, were seen as playing a role in facilitating competition 
on a product -by-product basis and in enabling institutions to harness informa tion more 
productively to develop tailored products that could be channelled to specially targeted 
customers. This process was aided by growing acceptance of electronic delivery channels 
on the part of financial consumers, which enabled service providers t o gain access to new 
customers without the necessity of a physical presence. These same arguments are re -
surfacing in the discussion today about some Fintech  innovations.  
In the years since the Group of Ten’s report was published, technological advances ha ve 
continued to drive structural changes in the financial services sector, having both direct 
and indirect effects. The question for the current report is where Fintech  developments fit 
in this process. The sheer pace of recent product and market innovatio ns and the wide 
range of different functions being targeted at present appear to raise some causes for 
concern. The following section seeks to gain some insights into Fintech  innovations, 
beginning with recent attempts to define the activity.  
Fintech  defin itions  
 “Fintech ” is a catchy label for the rapid developments in financial services that are 
largely being driven by digital technologies, but the term is not precisely defined in 
practice. In some references, the Fintech  label has become synonymous with the 
companies that provide any of the underlying technologies or services, and often comes 
with the misleading connotation of encompassing only start -up companies. Other 
definitions do not distinguish between the digital technology used and the financial 
services to which the technology is applied.  
While most definitions contain references to new technologies, to innovation, and/or to 
disruption, definitions that specify 'new technologies' tend to leave out innovations that 
rely on existing technologies, su ch as digital and mobile payments. Likewise, the focus 
on technology potentially ignores developments linked more to innovations in business 
models, such as the peer -to-peer platforms that are emerging. Also, the implicit 
assumption that Fintech  businesses  are start-up companies ignores the large number of 
well-established financial  service providers using these new digital technologies or 
offering similar services.  10 │ 1. FRAMEWORK FOR DIG ITALISATION IN FINAN CE 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   Some recent examples of Fintech  definitions include:  
 "finance enabled by new technologies" (EU Parliament)3,  
 "innovations in financial technology" (US National Economic Council)4, 
 "digitally enabled financial innovation" (FSB)5,  
 "newly emerging digital technologies adopted in the finance industry" 
(HKMA)6,  
 "a variety of innovative business mo dels and emerging technologies that have 
the potential to transform the financial services industry" (IOSCO)7, and  
 “emerging innovation involving the use of digital technologies for the 
provision of financial services”  
If the objective is to capture all financial innovations enabled by the use of digital 
technology, then most definitions will fall short. The FSB's definition and classification 
of 'digitally enabled financial innovation' sensibly links various innovations to their 
relevant economic functio n. But it does not differentiate between innovative technologies 
(e.g. wearables) and innovations in financial services (e.g. e -trading).  
The definition used by IOSCO of "a variety of innovative business models and emerging 
technologies that have the poten tial to transform the financial services industry" explicitly 
recognises both emerging technology and the new business models, but does not 
recognise the linkages between the two. Their proposed categorisation puts the categories 
of financial applications and new technologies on equal footing, but does so without 
recognising, for example, the applications of data and analytics to insurance or the 
relevance of digital currencies powered by blockchain  technology to payments. Nor does 
it recognise certain new technologies which can be used by financial service providers, 
including for example the use of biometric technology in security applications.  
Finally, none of these definitions and classifications recognises all of the relevant 
applications of digital tec hnology to financial services. Notably, the use of technology to 
improve the efficiency of internal processes, regulatory compliance, and communications 
is absent. The inclusion of such applications in the discussion about the changing 
financial landscape is therefore necessary.  
The shortcomings regarding the definitions and categorisations of Fintech  underline the 
need to develop a more comprehensive framework to help guide policy makers in 
approaching the topic of the digitalisation of financial services.  While a basic 
understanding of the technology may be necessary, a main concern of policymakers and 
regulators will be the applications of digital technologies and their implications for 
business models, organisational processes, etc.  
As long as technolog ical innovations provide for increased efficiencies, these 
developments will continue to drive significant changes in the way financial service 
providers operate, and will have significant implications for financial consumers, 
including micro and small bus inesses relating to the cost and security of services.  
All told, Fintech  involves not only the application of new digital technologies to financial 
services but also the development of business models and products which rely on these 
technologies and more  generally on digital platforms and processes.8 The framework 
elaborated in this article aims to overcome the limitations in the definitions and 
categorisations developed to this point. It distinguishes among new technologies that are 
emerging, the applica tions of these technologies and digital processing to financial 
services, and the most relevant aspects that are impacted by these trends. These 1. FRAMEWORK FOR DIGITA LISATION IN FINANCE  │ 11

 developments cut across a wide range of financial policy concerns and objectives relevant 
for the OECD Committe e on Financial Markets (CMF), including market structure, 
market stability, consumer protection, financial education and financial inclusion to name 
a few. The next section looks at the technologies that are behind the Fintech  wave of 
developments.  
Digital  technologies used in financial services  
The ongoing advances in telecommunications and computing technology have been an 
important force in the  transformation of finance. Technological advances have greatly 
improved quality and processing speed and helped to lower information costs and other 
costs of transacting. These developments have had implications for both providers and 
users of financial pr oducts and services.  
The discussion that follows provides a brief overview of new and emerging technologies 
that are being applied to financial services. These include distributed ledger technology, 
Big Data, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing,  artificial intelligence, biometric 
technologies and augmented/virtual reality. While these technologies are discussed 
separately it should be noted that there are interdependencies among many of them. For 
example, AI is enabled by Big Data, cloud computin g and increasingly the IoT.9 
Distributed ledger technologies  
Distributed ledger technology (DLT), also commonly referred to as blockchain  
technology, which is its most commonly used form, is a database technology that allows 
the creation, secure transfer ( with finality) and storage of information. Contrary to other 
ledgers, however, distributed ledgers are not centrally controlled and administered. 
Rather, the responsibility for administering and verifying transactions is shared across the 
users of the bloc kchain. Box 1 provides a brief introduction to how DLT works.  
DLT first emerged as the technology that underlies the cryptocurrency bitcoin. Since 
bitcoin was introduced, other such currencies have also been developed, perhaps most 
notably the Ether crypto currency using the Ethereum blockchain. However, numerous 
potential applications of DLT to financial services beyond digital currencies are 
becoming apparent. As such, given the link of DLT to the payments system, the 
technology has been receiving relative ly more attention than other technologies, as 
regulators see the need to understand the underlying concept and its implications and to 
address potential shortcomings and concerns on the consumer protection front.  
As a ledger technology, DLT could potential ly be applied to any sort of financial 
transaction relating to payments, including, for example, trading, post -trade settlements or 
insurance payouts. DLT has been used to establish smart contracts, or arrangements 
which automatically execute the agreed tr ansaction when certain conditions are met.  
DLT could also be used for a variety of recordkeeping tasks. Some applications have 
been to make compliance with Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements more efficient, 
or to streamline a mortgage application proce ss where documents from numerous parties 
are required. The transparency of these records may also facilitate the supervision of 
financial institutions by authorities.  12 │ 1. FRAMEWORK FOR DIG ITALISATION IN FINAN CE 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   Box 1. Distributed Ledger Technology  
DLT is a protocol used to build a ledger system to store records, such as those 
relating to ownership, transactions or contract agreements. DLT is not centrally 
controlled by a single party, or intermediary, however, and instead shares the 
responsibility of adding to and maintainin g the ledger with all participants. Each 
participant has their own identical copy of the ledger, and any new addition to the 
ledger must be approved and agreed upon by all participants. The ledgers are 
formed through a series, or 'chain' of blocks of infor mation. When a transaction 
has been approved by the participants, a new block is formed on the chain of 
transactions. This information is permanently recorded on the ledger, and cannot 
be tampered with.  
Unpermissioned or permissionless ledgers are open to anyone to contribute. 
Unpermissioned ledgers require participants to perform "mining", which involves 
solving complex and computationally intensive algorithms to validate 
transactions. This mechanism is known as "proof of work". Given the resources 
require d to mine, participants need to be provided some incentive to contribute to 
this process. This reward can be in the form of cryptocurrency, for example, as is 
done for bitcoin.  
Distributed ledgers can also be restricted to a group of approved participants,  
known as a permissioned or private ledger. Permissioned ledgers are less 
computationally intensive as the mining process is not required, and the 
participants in the consortium simply check the validity of the transaction. This 
structure also increases th e security of the ledger and reduces the risk of cyber -
attacks. Furthermore, as the ledger is not available to everyone, this format is 
more suited to recording confidential information.  
Source: ASTRI (2016), "Whitepaper on Distributed  Ledger Technology",  commissioned by the HKMA  
Given these applications, DLT has the potential to greatly improve the efficiency of 
operations in the financial sector. However, the immutability of the underlying code and 
the subsequent irreversibility of transactions could pre sent potential problems for 
financial transactions, as ultimately the accuracy of the underlying code is still exposed to 
human error. Mutable blockchains have been proposed as a way forward, even though 
such an approach may put the original purpose of the  technology, or at least some 
important aspects of it ( e.g. finality), in question.  
Big Data a nalytics  
The digitalisation of day -to-day activities has dramatically increased the amount of data 
available, creating extremely large and complex data sets commonly referred to as “Big 
Data”. Such data are not only drawn from text or numeric forms, but also from i mages, 
video and audio clips as well as from data generated by communication and other devices 
(e.g. smartphones, Internet -connected PCs). The rapid advances in information 
technology are now allowing for the processing and analysis of such large data sets .  
Big Data can potentially be used at every point along the value chain of financial 
products, from conception to sale. Analysis of Big Data could be used to improve market 
research and inform product design. It could also be used for more granular price 1. FRAMEWORK FOR DIGITA LISATION IN FINANCE  │ 13 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 discrimination by allowing a more accurate assessment of a given individual's risk profile 
or willingness to pay. Profiling can also lead to targeted advertising, which in one 
application could tailor online promotions to an individual's characteristics in ferred from 
their Internet use. Big Data could also potentially be used for internal risk management 
and outside monitoring of financial services and institutions and thus make supervision 
more efficient. For example, analysis of large data sets could impr ove fraud detection.  
Three concepts closely connected to Big Data are the “Internet of Things”, cloud 
computing and artificial intelligence. The Internet of Things is a source of Big Data, 
cloud computing facilitates the processing and storage of large dat asets, and finally 
artificial intelligence is an advanced way of analysing and using Big Data. These 
concepts are discussed in turn.  
Internet of things  
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the numerous connected devices that capture 
information regarding  movement and other sensing data of objects in the physical world, 
and is expected to represent an increasing source of Big Data. The IoT can provide rich 
information regarding individuals’ behaviours; thereby, the resulting data can be used for 
increased tailoring of products, risk profiling and pricing.   
Cloud computing  and storage  
Cloud -based services provide cost -efficient and relatively easily scalable on -demand 
processing and storage capacity for data. Cloud technology has greatly increased the 
capaci ty of financial institutions to collect and analyse data, thereby facilitating the 
growth in data analytics and their various applications.  
Artificial intelligence  
The sub -fields of this science can focus on a range of different aspects of human 
intelligen ce, including recognition, understanding, learning, problem solving, reasoning 
and decision making.10 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is often used in reference to machine learning, whereby 
machines are trained with historical data to recognise patterns and cl assify new data. 
Through advanced algorithms a machine can learn patterns with new experiences to 
improve its performance. However, the machine is not learning entirely on its own; 
rather, the learning process requires a significant level of human input to  make sure the 
data is interpreted correctly.11  
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. It takes a layered approach to calculations, 
starting from high -level abstractions and gradually moving to more specific features. As 
deep learning is able to ta ckle unstructured data such as text and images, it has many 
potential applications for the analysis of Big Data.  
Biometric technologies  
Biometric technologies rely on the recognition of physiological or behavioural 
characteristics, and can be used for ide ntity authentication by detecting characteristics 
unique to individuals. Techniques that are now being used for verification include 
fingerprint scanning, voice authentication, face recognition, iris scanning, and gait 
recognition.  14 │ 1. FRAMEWORK FOR DIG ITALISATION IN FINAN CE 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   Biometric technologies represent a great improvement in security over verification by 
passwords, and could be used to increase the security of financial transactions, thereby 
reducing the risk of fraud or data theft. Nevertheless, these technologies are still in 
development and security is being improved to reduce the risk that biometric information 
is compromised.  
Augmented/v irtual reality  
Augmented and virtual realities provide new ways for consumers to perceive or interact 
with their environment. The difference between the two  is that augmented reality 
provides an enhanced view of the actual physical world in which individuals find 
themselves, whereas virtual reality creates a simulated world.  
3.  Applications of d igital technologies in financial services  
As noted previously, tech nological advances and new innovations have had effects all 
along the value chain for financial products and services, in numerous applications, some 
of which have been introduced by new entities while others have come from incumbent 
financial institutions  and other existing service providers.  
The framework presented here classifies the applications covered into eight distinct 
categories: payments , planning , lending and funding , trading  and investment , 
insurance , cyber security , operations , and communicatio ns.  
Table 1 provides a mapping of the selected digital technologies to the categories of 
financial activities and services being affected. As shown , some digital technologies have 
wide ranging applications while others remain more limited, but all have the potential to 
significantly impact financial services/markets.  These categories and the effects of 
Fintech  developments on financial contracting in these activities and services are 
discussed in the following sub -sections.

Payments  
Payments represent the most basic application of digital technology to financial services, 
one which, while not new, is evolving with emerging technologies. Although digital 
payments began with physical instruments (e.g. credit cards), payments have been 
moving more and more into the virtual domain. These innovative payment services can 1. FRAMEWORK FOR DIGITA LISATION IN FINANCE  │ 15 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 broadly be classified into online payments and mobile payments, although the increased 
use of mobile broadband connections for mobile communications is admittedly lessening 
the importance of the distinction. Online payments are defined as payment orders which 
are placed using devices connected to the Internet, and mobile payments as those which 
rely upon devices connected to a mobile communication network.12 Therefore online 
payments encompass online banking, electronic commerce (e.g. Amazon) and payment 
services (e.g. PayPal).  
Mobile payments include mobile money transactions using mobile network operators 
(e.g. payments by SMS) and pre -paid cards linked to mobile phones. Pay ments are not 
restricted to the banking sector either; mobile payment applications also exist for 
insurance, where registration and insurance payments can be performed using a mobile 
device.13  
In other developments, digital transactions are being used in n ew business models 
established to facilitate cross -border payments, namely through peer -to-peer currency 
exchange platforms, which can match currency buyers and sellers to eliminate the spread 
on the exchange rate.  
Innovative payments applications are also  making use of DLT. The first payment 
application made possible through this technology was the cryptocurrency bitcoin, and 
the technology has since been used for other cryptocurrencies like Ether. 
Cryptocurrencies can be used as regular currency, and can be managed with digital 
wallets stored on a smartphone. All transactions are permanently recorded on the 
blockchain, and new currency can be generated by 'miners' who succeed in solving the 
required algorithm.  
Smart contracts are a more recent development in the use of DLT for payments, but they 
have not as yet raised the same types of concerns as the other DLT -related forms of 
payment. These agreements are self -enforcing and automatically execute a transaction 
when certain conditions are met. Such arrangem ents can be used, for example, to 
facilitate swap payments. They have also been used in the insurance sector to 
automatically pay out insurance claims when the insured event, such as a delayed flight, 
occurs.14 Additional applications are also being develop ed for insurance, such as the 
automatic settlement payments for natural catastrophe swaps or optimising payments for 
international fronting for captive insurers.15 Smart contracts could also be combined with 
IoT technology to automatically link connected de vices with the related insurance 
policy.16  
In more recent applications, market participants are attempting to design a solution using 
DLT to make post -trade payments, clearing, and settlement more rapid and efficient. 
However, such applications have not ye t succeeded at being implemented in practice and 
some observers have expressed doubts as to whether blockchain would be well suited to 
such transactions.17 
Advice and planning  
The rise of digital platforms presents numerous opportunities for engaging and as sisting 
consumers with their own financial planning. Websites and online courses can facilitate 
consumer access to financial information and training. Advice and planning have also 
been facilitated by augmented reality, which can be combined with gamificat ion to 
improve the learning experience. Training can also be made more interactive through 
gamification, which can help to develop consumers’ competencies and confidence in 16 │ 1. FRAMEWORK FOR DIG ITALISATION IN FINAN CE 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   managing their finances. Budget tools and retirement planning tools can help consum ers 
to better plan their spending and savings. Other applications, such as self -commitment 
tools which help consumers to save, can help consumers to address their own behavioural 
biases. Such digital tools to support financial education have been widely de veloped.18 
Digital platforms can also be used to help consumers to keep track of their finances. 
Some countries have developed pension “dashboards” which enable beneficiaries to 
obtain an overview of all of their sources of pension income and to take corres ponding 
actions, such as adjusting their contribution rates.19 
Digital platforms can also help consumers to compare financial products and decide on 
those  products in which to invest. Comparison platforms have been developed to help 
consumers choose insuran ce products, mortgages, and investment/savings products. Both 
are being applied notably to financial education and financial planning services.  
Advice and planning have also been facilitated by augmented reality, which can be us ed 
to improve the learning e xperience through “gamification”.20 Augmented reality can help 
to facilitate the comprehension of complex data sets through immersive data 
visualisation. For consumers, augmented reality has been used to help investors visualise 
their investments and facili tate their investment decisions.21 
Another application of digital technology in the advice and planning sphere takes the 
form of robo -advisors , which are beginning to use AI technology for client services and 
to provide investment advice based on an individual's account activity. AI is also being 
used for consumer support, whereby chatbots  can interactively answer questions that 
consumers may ha ve about their product or service.   
Virtual reality applications similar to those of augmented reality have also been 
developed in applications for financial advice that provide virtual consultations with 
banking or insurance experts.22 
Investment and tradi ng 
Digital technologies have also been used to create new and/or more efficient ways to 
access and optimise trading and investment. For example, direct trading and investment 
platforms are facilitating access to markets for both institutional investors and  retail 
consumers. For institutional investors, these platforms are reducing reliance on market 
makers for trading purposes. For retail investors, trading and investing can be done at a 
much lower price than going through an intermediary, and some platform s even offer 
ready -made professionally designed portfolios.23 Social trading platforms are another 
example. They can allow investors to automatically copy the trading strategies of traders 
that they choose to follow.  
At a basic level, the application of alg orithms to trading and the speed with which 
transactions can be executed has enabled high -frequency trading. But algorithmic trading 
is now being expanded to new applications.  
Robo -advice platforms offer investment and portfolio management services which can 
automatically trade to maintain the desired risk profiles of portfolios or to realise 
investment losses for tax purposes.24 Robo -advice platforms can also use algorithms to 
recommend a certain investment strategy given an investor's profile or risk. Sim ilar 
services marketed to businesses can help them to manage portfolio risk or optimise asset -
liability management.  1. FRAMEWORK FOR DIGITA LISATION IN FINANCE  │ 17 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 AI also has potential applications for the optimisation of investment, by recognising 
patterns and predicting which investments will be high  future performers.  The 
technology is already being applied for hedge funds.25 Some hedge funds are already 
using AI in their investment models. AI is also being used to integrate ESG variables into 
the investment strategy.26  
In another application of digi tal technology to investment and trading, augmented reality 
has been tested as a means to help traders improve their ability to quickly digest financial 
market data and recognise trends.  
Lending and funding  
Applications of digital technology to lending an d funding operations are helping to make 
credit accessible to individuals or businesses that previously may have had difficulty 
accessing the traditional credit market.  
New business models for lending and funding are emerging, notably peer -to-peer 
platform s. These peer -to-peer platforms can take on one of several different models. With 
donation and reward -based platforms, the individuals funding the counterparty donate 
funds outright, e.g. for a social cause or in exchange for a future reward (typically a 
product or service generated by the funded project). With loan -based platforms, 
individuals expect to be repaid their investment with a return. With equity -based 
platforms, individuals receive a stake in the company raising funds.   
Big Data is also providin g an opportunity to better assess the risks related to lending. 
New methods for calculating credit scores based on non -traditional variables such as 
social networks are emerging in practice, refining these scores to better represent an 
individual's risk ch aracteristics.   
In another application of Big Data, payment processor Worldpay began extending loans 
to SMEs in partnership with Liberis, a London -based nonbank business -to-business 
lender, offering unsecured cash advances based on projected card sales. Wo rldpay is able 
to analyse the sales data going through its system to determine in advance what amount 
customers are able to repay and over what time period and, thus, is able to advance only 
amounts of capital that are within those limits.  
Insurance27 
Appli cations of digital platforms and new technologies are also transforming insurance. 
First, they are changing the way insurance is accessed and distributed. Providers are now 
offering access to insurance through mobile devices, for example. Peer -to-peer insu rance 
platforms are also emerging, whereby individuals can form their own group of individuals 
with whom to pool risk.28 
The biggest impact to insurance, however, may be the uses of technology to improve 
underwriting and the pricing of risk. Big Data and im proved data analytics, including AI, 
are increasing the number of variables which can be taken into account for the pricing of 
a policy. However, while this may increase precision, it also may push the boundaries of 
the goal of insurance to pool risks and lead to exclusion from insurance for risks deemed 
to be “bad risks”.  
This increased precision and efficiency in underwriting also enables new types of 
products to be offered. Insurance contracts can be issued for very short periods of time, 
for example, fo r specific car trips or for short -term home rentals.  18 │ 1. FRAMEWORK FOR DIG ITALISATION IN FINAN CE 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   Digital technology is also changing how policies can be underwritten. For example, facial 
recognition technology can be used to estimate the health and age of an individual for the 
underwriting of life insurance. Sensors and cameras in cars can detect the driver's 
behaviour on the road, and this information can be used to determine the premiums for 
auto insurance.  
In the health arena, AI can also be used to analyse photos to identify certain medical 
cond itions or the health of individuals. It has successfully been implemented, for 
example, to detect skin cancer from a photo on par with the performance of 
dermatologists.29  
Cybersecurity30 
While the increased reliance on digital technology may increase the r isk of cybersecurity 
being compromised, digital technology also presents numerous opportunities to improve 
the security of digital financial services.31 Data encryption to protect digitally stored data 
is improving with technology. Biometric technology can be used to improve identity 
verification and authentication to reduce the risk of stolen passwords or falsified 
transactions. Data analytics can be used to detect irregular patterns and pinpoint if fraud 
has occurred. DLT could increase the transparency of  transactions, making them easier to 
track and control, and also reduce the risk of falsified transactions.  
Operations  
For all types of financial institutions, technology has the potential to greatly improve the 
effectiveness of processes and efficiencies with which they operate and reduce overall 
overhead costs. Day -to-day processes can be streamlined through increased automation. 
Compliance functions can be more efficient, and applications of technology are being 
devoted to facilitating regulatory complia nce, which are often referred to as “RegTech”. 
Such applications can facilitate regulatory reporting requirements or other compliance 
processes, for example through the use of DLT or another digital database to facilitate 
Know Your Customer (KYC) requireme nts. Applications are also being developed to 
facilitate risk management functions.  
Communications  
New technologies are also changing the way financial services providers communicate 
with their clients. They are changing the way financial products are mark eted. Online ads 
are often targeted to the profile of their viewers, which is inferred from their online 
behaviour and browsing habits. Once consumers are engaged with a product or service, 
regular communications can be tailored to them individually, for e xample, via text 
message reminders to contribute to a savings plan or pension fund or to pay bills. 
Consumer support functions can also be transformed with technology, such as the use of 
chat bots or virtual reality sessions with an advisor.  
4.  Aspects of fin ancial activities and services affected by Fintech  developments  
Generally speaking, understanding the impacts and implications of Fintech  developments  
can be approached in one of three ways . The first way is to start with the technology, 
such as DLT, and t hen look at the applications of this technology to financial services and 
the potential implications that it can have. The second is to look at a specific application, 
such as crowdfunding, and consider the implications specific to this application. The th ird 1. FRAMEWORK FOR DIGITA LISATION IN FINANCE  │ 19 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 way is to start with a focus on the impacts that these changes are having, such as 
increased cyber -risk, and what these changes imply for specific policy objectives.  
Figure  1. Dimensions from which to assess the digitalisation  of financial services  
 
The applications of these new digital technologies are having a major effect on key 
aspects of financial activities and services. To understand it helps to start with the basics 
of financial contracting. Financial transactions can be executed on a bilateral or 
multilateral basis, either directly between counterparties or through markets or indirectly 
through financial intermediaries. A core objective of the financial system is to help 
facilitate these interactions. The pooling and a llocation of scarce and dispersed capital to 
facilitate the exchange of goods, services, and ideas is one of the core intermediation 
functions.  Other main functions of the financial system and the intermediaries operating 
therein include:  
 Facilitating an efficient storage of wealth  
 Facilitating maturity transformation  
 Facilitating the exchange of domestic payments  
 Facilitating the exchange of currencies between countries; and  
 Providing a means by which financial and other risks can be managed  
Technological  progress, broadly construed to include technical aspects of digitalisation 
along with Fintech  innovations, is affecting many aspects of the financial intermediation 
process, ranging from upstream activities associated with the creation/origination of 
products and services all along the value chain to activities associated with their 
distribution to end -consumers. The evolving digital production functions, embodying 
digital products transmitted over digital channels, are changing the economics of the 
financ ial intermediation process.  
Growing acceptance and trust on the part of consumers, at least for some aspects of 
digital life, is a big part of this development. As financial consumers have become more 
knowledgeable about financial products and services, an d as their comfort level with

FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   technology (e.g. online delivery channels) has grown, the number and type of activities 
they require to be carried out in direct physical proximity to the service provider have 
declined. This trend has been longstanding for ma ny services at the wholesale end of 
financial services, but it has also firmed for many retail financial services, as the Internet 
and other electronic delivery channels have grown in popularity. Financial education 
plays a role in this process by helping consumers better understand financial markets, 
products and services, but technology has played a major role. By lowering search costs, 
ICT has enabled financial consumers to more easily acquire information, not only about 
alternative products and services  but also about the providers of these services, including 
about the quality of the customer experience they offer.  
For the financial services sector as a whole, these factors have given rise to 
multidimensional effects on competition. New competitors hav e entered, including 
various types of non -traditional competitors, offering more flexible terms and improved 
quality. Examples of the aspects of financial intermediation that have been affected are 
described in the following sub -sections.32 
Operational effi ciencies  
In the merger wave period in the wake of financial liberalisation, competition for savings 
was increasing both within financial service sectors and among intermediaries from 
different financial services sectors. This phase was mainly about consoli dation and 
integration of financial services, both vertically and horizontally, across products and 
geography, in the quest for scale and scope economies.  
While scale and concentration pose potential risks for stability, these risks are fairly well 
unders tood by the policy making community, so apart from the occasional intervention by 
competition authorities, the process of consolidation was allowed more or less to continue 
for some time, as long as managerial expertise and capital kept pace with the expan sion in 
size and scope of operations. Among other benefits, new ICT technology brought lower 
infrastructure costs, which helped to increase the feasible scale of providing certain types 
of financial products and services (e.g. custody, risk management and asset management). 
Lower infrastructure costs also facilitate increased distribution capacity, even globally, 
given the ubiquitous nature of the Internet.  
Scale economies can still exist in th e Fintech  world, but in contrast to the physical size of 
an enterprise, in this case it relates to access to data. Customer data becomes the principal 
source of comparative advantage and a potential barrier to entry. There can be data scope 
effects as well. This is certainly the case for many Internet firms, with busi ness models 
that involve the collection and analysis of large streams of data collected from the 
Internet .33 By collecting and analysing “ Big Data ”, Internet companies are able to 
automate their processes and to experiment with, and foster, new products and  business 
models at much a faster rate than non -Internet based competitors. In particular, the 
advanced use of data and analytics enables Internet firms to scale their businesses at 
much lower costs than other ICT firms.  
In the financial sphere, the increased efficiency that technological innovation allows in 
terms of processes and operations can also result in lower operational and regulatory 
compliance costs. While new entrants tend to be more nimble and flexible in adap ting to 
changing markets, mainly on account of not being burdened by legacy systems, securing 
these benefits can prove challenging for incumbent players, which are required to update 
their IT systems and administration, especially those entities formed via  mergers of 1. FRAMEWORK FOR DIGITA LISATION IN FINANCE  │ 21 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 various separate institutions, each with their own systems, which can present 
compatibility problems.  
Intermediation  
The disintermediation of financial services providers is often the focus of discussions 
relating to the digitalisation of finan cial services, but these trends also result in changes in 
intermediation or even new intermediaries being created. The use of cryptocurrencies as a 
means of exchanging payment s is a prime example of a technological innovation 
challenging the business model  of incumbent providers, as electronic payments no longer 
have to go through banks. Peer -to-peer platforms change the intermediary structure, with 
the digital platforms, which match both sides of the transaction, replacing the traditional 
bank as counterpa rty.  
Robo-advisors also remove a level of intermediation, giving consumers direct access to 
the types of tools that financial advisors have been using for years. Mobile distribution 
agents who sell mobile insurance or provide mobile payment services in em erging 
countries are another new form of intermediary.  
Speed  
Speed has two meanings in the context of the digitalisation of financial services; it refers 
both to the speed of operations and the speed of change. On the one hand, digital 
transactions can be executed much more quickly than could be done previously. This may 
also imply that consumers may take less time to reflect on their transactions. The speed of 
trading in the market also may impact market movements and stability. On the other 
hand, the spee d of change means that technologies and services are evolving rapidly, and 
both regulators and consumers alike will need to stay on top of these changes to ensure 
that these services can be used safely and effectively.  
Accessibility  
The digitalisation of f inancial services has generally increased the accessibility of various 
financial products and  services to consumers and has great potential to help attenuate 
financial exclusion of more vulnerable groups. New models have targeted previously 
underserved mar ket segments , and mobile banking in particular has brought banking 
services to these market  segments  in developing economies. Nevertheless the trend 
towards digital and online -only services may inadvertently contribute to the financial 
exclusion of groups who lack the connectivity and/or the technical skills or knowledge to 
use them, such as the elderly.  
As financial services are also becoming accessible from a large variety of devices this 
may have implications for how consumers perceive the products and services in which 
they are engaging and how these services are adapted to a given device.  
Consumers a nd small businesses may need new technical skills to use digital financial 
services that also expose them to new risks. These trends have implications for the 
educational and legal protection needs of the population, and the question for policy 
makers is h ow financial education and financial consumer protection can be made more 
effective in this environment34. 22 │ 1. FRAMEWORK FOR DIG ITALISATION IN FINAN CE 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   Consumer engagement  
New customer interfaces and the ease of use of digital financial services have the 
potential to increase the degree to which consu mers are active in managing their finances, 
and offer new opportunities to engage consumers with technology such as text messages 
and videos. Nevertheless these trends may also lead to consumer disengagement, as the 
ease of transacting may require less fol low-through on the part of the consumer. The 
reliance of some services on automation may also lead to a lack of attention by 
consumers, as no real action is required on their part to manage their investment. Such 
ease of use may also create new risks for t he consumer, and may lead to overuse and cost 
increases on the side of the provider  
Automation  
Along with the use of digital technology in financial services comes the increased 
reliance on algorithms and the automation of processes. While in some respects  reduced 
human involvement also reduces the chances for human error, the algorithms themselves 
rely initially on human input; therefore, this exposure is not fully eliminated. 
Furthermore, with automation any potential errors may be more difficult to detec t before 
a problem occurs and may spread faster and more widely before being remedied. 
Automation, particularly with respect to investments, could also lead to herding 
behaviour, potentially affecting market valuations and stability.  
Product delivery  
Techn ological improvements have transformed the way financial institutions develop and 
distribute their products and services. Quite simply, face -to-face interaction has given 
way to online delivery for most standardised products, and products and services that  
were once thought necessary to be tailored to the specific ities of particular customers can 
also now be developed, contracted, and delivered remotely.  
The global nature of the Internet, as a basis for delivery, makes a global scale feasible, 
even for sma ller entities, providing for cross -border access without the necessity of a 
physical presence. The upfront fixed costs can be sizable, but once in place the marginal 
costs are much more trivial.  
Digital security risks  
The increased reliance on digital tech nology and digital financial services clearly goes 
hand in hand with higher digital security risk. While cybersecurity risk is not unique to 
Fintech , greater connectivity from digital solutions expands the number of entry points 
for cyber hackers in search  of a weak link in the network.35 This may be particularly 
relevant for client -facing applications using customer data, and new devices, including 
those connected to the “Internet of Things.” Indeed, a number of recent incidents have 
involved fraud and thef t through mobile banking apps, and there have been breaches of 
personally identifiable information, particularly as a large number of mobile devices lack 
anti-virus software.  
The OECD report on the Next Production Revolution  notes that cybersecurity risks  and 
lack of trust are often indicated as the most common reasons that financial consumers 
with access to the Internet do not use some digital technologies and applications and 
refrain from engaging in online or mobile transactions.36 Among the concerns com monly 
expressed are the growing risk of online fraud and the misuse of personal data as well as 1. FRAMEWORK FOR DIGITA LISATION IN FINANCE  │ 23 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 the rising complexity of online transactions and related terms and conditions. 
Uncertainties about the existence and effectiveness of redress mechanisms in the event of 
a problem with an online purchase add to their reluctance. The following sub -section 
discusses these issues in more detail.  
Data analytics, privacy and transparency  
Information technology influences the gathering of information, its analysis, and its 
transmission. Digital technological progress has greatly increased the ability for advanced 
analytics to be used in financial services. While this development can lead to better -suited 
products and services, it also raises the issue as to whether there  should be a limit to 
individual profiling. This issue has particular implications for consumer protection and 
privacy relating to targeted marketing as well as the pricing of insurance and access to the 
insurance market. It also creates policy issues rela ted to exclusion of disadvantaged 
individuals from lending and other financial services more generally.  
The use of AI, in particular, requires consideration as to  how such algorithms should be 
audited and monitored, and what sort of impact implementing in vestment models that use 
AI could have on market valuations and stability.  
The increased availability and use of consumer data raises issues relating to the 
ownership and use of this data and the implications this could have for consumer privacy. 
It also raises questions about the extent to which available data should be shared to 
enhance regulatory and consumer protections. There will need to be a balance found 
between these two objectives of protecting consumers’ privacy and ensuring transparency 
of tran sactions.  
5.  Structural i mplications of Fintech  innovations  
As the discussion in the previous section suggests, many key aspects of the production 
and distribution of financial products and services are being affected by developments 
linked to new digital te chnologies. All of these developments affect the way that investors 
and financial consumers interact with providers of financial products. But underlying 
these developments are some basic needs that haven’t changed, and it is important in the 
attempt to as sess the potential implications of Fintech  innovations to have a clear idea of 
the “big picture”.  
Financial service providers can certainly structure new products and call on their sales 
and marketing teams to try to convince clients that they really ‘need ’ the products in 
question, but most successful products satisfy an existing need. In this context, retail 
clients still have a need for some type of current account, for loans to finance large 
purchases and investments, for financial advice, and for remit tance capabilities and 
money transfers. Corporate clients still have a need for equity, debt, M&As, advice, cash 
management, foreign exchange operations, etc. These basic needs remain more or less the 
same. What is changing, from the viewpoint of the end -users, is how the needs are met.  
In effect, the traditional relationship between consumers and financial service providers is 
being altered by the new digital technologies and related services. The channels through 
which funds flow from sources of funds to users, are changing.  
The various components of the financial system – the institutions, markets, and 
infrastructures – help to support sustainable long -term growth of the economy by helping 
to ensure that scarce savings are allocated optimally among compet ing investment 24 │ 1. FRAMEWORK FOR DIG ITALISATION IN FINAN CE 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   opportunities. The functions that support the attainment of this objective include credit 
allocation, price discovery, and facilitation of payments. These financial intermediation 
functions help to link providers and users of funds and allow  consumption decisions to be 
smoothed over time and across geographic space.  
Digital technologies and their applications are resulting in much lower costs of interaction 
and less importance of geographical proximity. The importance of physical locations fo r 
providing these functions, such as bank branches, has dropped considerably for many 
types of financial transactions (e.g. payments) as has their importance as primary sources 
of information about the consumer (especially at the retail level). This shift in information 
and some basic banking services hits traditional intermediation at its core and, at a 
minimum, threatens the revenues incumbent service providers have derived from 
providing these relatively standardised products and services. In some concei vable future 
scenarios, the economic viability of traditional business models linked to these services 
becomes highly questionable.  
Competitive ch allenges to incumbent service providers  
Theoretical arguments have long held that the process of financial intermediation is 
mainly about processing information of one form or another. In the strictest 
interpretation,37 intermediaries owe their very existence to the information asymmetry 
between would -be users and sources of funds and to other market imperfectio ns that 
make it costly for users to find sources (search costs) and negotiate directly.38  
A few decades ago, as the digital revolution was picking up in earnest, and as regulatory 
barriers to entry were coming down, researchers began to hypothesise that th is particular 
function of intermediaries would cease to add value (i.e. warrant remuneration) if relevant 
information about prospective users of funds were readily available. The particulars of the 
hypothesis put forward was that, as costs of interaction f ell, more sources of funds would 
go directly to prospective users and serve as new points of interface, and that new forms 
of intermediaries would emerge to provide online markets and to assist in solving the 
matching problem between the supply of funds an d demand.  
Researchers further hypothesised that this process would result in the eventual complete 
deconstruction of the value chain  for financial services, whereby product creation would 
be completely unbundled  from distribution: upstream would be  institu tions that supply 
products linked to  specific, stand -alone businesses, and downstream would be specialised 
entities  that use  their distribution networks to market products of institutions from 
whatever service segment.  
Many arguments put forward in this co ntext stopped short of full ‘open architecture’ but 
nonetheless identified a number of alternative competitive scenarios, which collectively 
contained the following key characteristics:  
 unbundling of production from distribution  
 less value to vertical int egration  
 decline in the role of traditional intermediaries  
 increase in disaggregation, including outsourcing  
 increased specialisation (e.g. product specialists, channel specialists, relationship 
specialists)  
 new forms of intermediaries  1. FRAMEWORK FOR DIGITA LISATION IN FINANCE  │ 25 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 A couple of decades ago when these scenarios were formulated, the likelihood of their 
becoming reality seemed remote. But as data capture and analytics have grown and as 
digital technologies have further developed, costs of interaction have indeed declined and 
numerous market  segments (e.g. credit extension, provision of risk capital, insurance, 
advisory services, wealth management) have been challenged by new digital -based firms, 
including entities from outside the traditional types of service providers.  
These new companies have a number of advantages over incumbents, including 
importantly, their adaptability to individual client needs. Unencumbered by legacy 
infrastructures and focused on only a few core services, these new companies are able to 
offer users a more tailored, faster, and more cost -effective service.  
As the discussion on applications indicates, digital -based financial services are being 
targeted at various market segments, lending being a prominent example, and transactions 
are increasingly being executed across  more than one jurisdiction (subject to local 
restrictions), which again points to the waning importance of location as a determinant of 
how consumers access financial products and services.  
The decline in the importance of geography is certainly at odds with historical 
arrangements established to service the retail market segment. The importance of the 
face-to-face relationship led services providers to devote considerable attention and 
investment on developing or gaining access to such distribution chann els. The classic 
examples include the branch -based distribution network of commercial banks and the 
local agent/broker network of insurance companies. The problem with these 
infrastructures, especially the physical branch networks  of commercial banks, is t hat they 
are very costly to establish and maintain. Given the high fixed costs, to make them more 
cost-effective and efficient requires increasing the volume of products and services that 
are distributed through them.  But these strategies are not without l imits and the existence 
of more efficient specialised (online) providers will continue to put pressure on margins 
derived from physical interface points.  
It is difficult to pass a high enough volume of products through physical distribution 
channels to spr ead the fixed costs to levels that achieve competitive pricing against digital 
delivery methods. And digital delivery has other advantages: it makes it feasible to reach 
dispersed clients who are geographically remote or even across borders, provided they are 
connected to the Internet; digital delivery also facilitates adding to  the services that are 
on offer; in the process potentially creating products that are better tailored to the end 
user; and, digital technology makes it feasible to provide the same  product or service in 
several languages and deliver it via multiple platforms to reach different population 
segments, including vulnerable groups such as migrants and those with disabilities. Given 
these advantages, it seems clear that physical distributi on channels face a serious 
competitive threat if clients no longer require a face -to-face interface. Incumbent 
institutions face the difficult challenge of finding ways to rationalise their existing 
physical distribution points or to close them.   
New busin ess models and product design  
While it is far from clear that the point of complete deconstruction of the value chain for 
financial products and services is near, evidence is emerging in favour of most of the 
components of the future scenarios hypothesised  some years back. Digital technology is 
becoming a means of offering faster, more convenient, and more cost -effective service, 
which is proving to be a major competitive advantage.  26 │ 1. FRAMEWORK FOR DIG ITALISATION IN FINAN CE 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018    On the consumer side, new payments technologies and digital financial serv ices are 
altering the relationship between consumers and financial service providers and could 
prove disruptive for bank business models. New types of marketplace lenders, such as 
peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding platforms, have emerged to support the  financing 
of SMEs. These new players are also targeting previously excluded or underserved 
market segments, including in particular mass market and more vulnerable groups,  while 
offering higher returns or diversified investment opportunities to institutio nal investors.  
Financial innovations and digital technologies are also emerging in the asset management 
and wealth management industries, through the emergence of online automated and 
algorithm -based portfolio managers (robo -advisors).   
The emergence of p eer-to-peer platforms, which match consumers and borrowers/lenders 
with one another, is one of the key innovations in terms of business models that have 
been driven by the digitalisation of finance.  
These digital innovations drive costs down and in serving  borrowers who might be 
overlooked by traditional banks have the potential to increase consumer welfare and 
support increased growth of the economy. As the competitive pressure on incumbent 
service providers has increased, so, too, have the prospects for n ew forms of industry 
configuration. Digital technologies make it feasible for institutions to specialise either in 
production (where they bear the risks of the products and services) or in distribution 
(where they manage the customer interface).  Banks, in contrast, tend to offer a range of 
products and services, without necessarily being optimised for any of them.  
Hence, the potential is certainly there for these innovative models to take substantial 
market share  from pre -existing products and firms. The th reat of disintermediation is 
apparent . But is  it an existential one? There are arguments in favour of increased 
specialisation as a means of providing more tailored and cost -effective service, but do 
they imply that all multi -product financial services org anisations will become financially 
non-viable and need to be unwound?  
The outcome will depend in part on three factors. The first is the extent to which 
consumers perceive the products from digital financial service providers to be close 
substitutes for t hose from traditional intermediaries and the market configurations that 
enable consumers to easily switch from one service provider to another ( e.g. flexible 
types of distribution channels, low entry barriers, low switching costs), the second is on 
consume rs’ loyalty to specific products, and finally on the perceived quality of the 
existing product relative to alternatives.  
Temporal issues related to financial innovations  
In some market segments, digital provision may appear to be safer (e.g. avoiding human 
error or human biases), but that is not the case in all contexts (i.e. cybersecurity issues),39 
and that latter risk may constitute an important limiting factor of digitalisation, as it 
bumps into the underlying need for trust in all financial transac tions. There is a temporal 
aspect to this question.  
New products and services may appear to be successful when first introduced, but 
properly functioning markets for the products can take longer to develop, part of a less 
rapid process of learning and str ategic adjustment. Many episodes of financial instability 
have occurred in the wake of a change in the structural regime that often reflected some 
form of market innovation that altered the nature of competition and had unintended 
consequences. Given this history, it is rational to exercise some caution to ensure that the 1. FRAMEWORK FOR DIGITA LISATION IN FINANCE  │ 27 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 new innovations do not have negative externalities or, worse, constitute new sources of 
systemic risk.   
In this sense, the new business models that have been introduced have not been around 
long enough to prove their long -term viability, such as through the financial and 
economic cycle. For example, one might ask whether Fintech  credit is a source of long -
term funding that can survive a crisis. Clients will be more likely to accept Fintech  credit 
as a direct or even improved substitute for bank credit if it remains available through an 
economic downturn.  
There is a second temporal aspect of financial innovati on. It relates to the fact that 
innovations can have many potential applications, and the application that proves to have 
the greatest impact may not be the one initially adopted.  
The competitive response of incumbents  
A second factor to consider is the c ompetitive response of incumbents. Traditionally, or at 
least since the early 1980s when regulatory barriers between different segments of 
financial services began to be removed, many large financial services institutions have 
engaged in the joint producti on and distribution of a range of financial products and 
services, including all sub -components, through integrated operating structures. But the 
use and spread of digital technologies has begun to challenge the economic rationale 
underlying the value of i ntegration, in lieu of what some call the superior economies of 
specialised providers (e.g. back -office operations, accounting processes, provision of 
ATMs, etc.)  
But institutions have begun to respond to the challenges from the digital sphere. Digital 
technologies also make it possible for existing providers to reduce their costs and possibly 
retain or recoup some of the customers they’ve lost to more nimble online competitors. 
Digital technology has become an intrinsic part of the financial services indu stry, 
influencing how financial institutions conduct their business and the products they offer, 
although progress in this capacity is uneven.  
Nonetheless, squeezed margins in some core product areas and higher compliance costs 
associated with Know your c ustomer (KYC) and Anti -Money Laundering (AML) rules 
are forcing institutions to rationalise their cost structures. Institutions have become more 
strategic. The days of the one -stop shop offering all products to all comers appear to be 
receding in favour of  concentrating on areas of perceived comparative advantages in 
order to realise scale and (where they exist) scope economies, while disintegrating other 
parts of the value chain and relying on the marketplace or strategic partnerships to carry 
out the othe r functions. Some of these partnerships are with Fintech  entities; after all, "if 
you can’t beat it, buy it".  
While some institutions have been reluctant to entrust “core” aspects of their business to 
third -parties, outsourcing has more generally become mo re widespread and some 
institutions distribute non -proprietary products through their networks in addition to their 
own. In the future, they may become distributors only. Technology makes it feasible for 
institutions to specialise either in production or d istribution, customers demand the 
benefits of better service and better pricing, and there do not appear to be any specific 
rules to prohibit it.  
Business models are also changing in terms of pricing structures, with many moving 
towards more transparent s tructures than the traditional banking models provided and 
with lower fees.  28 │ 1. FRAMEWORK FOR DIG ITALISATION IN FINAN CE 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   Concerns about the regulatory perimeter  
Some institutions are also raising concerns about the constraints imposed on them by the 
regulatory framework, which impedes their ability t o compete. The effects of prudential 
regulation have a direct bearing on competitive level playing field issues. In this context, 
the third factor affecting the structural response to new Fintech  innovations relates to the 
contours of the regulatory perime ter. Existing regulation may not adequately cover these 
new models, may present impediments for these models to operate efficiently and 
effectively, or alternatively prohibit them from operating at all.  
Technically, the system is functioning as it should. In the absence of market 
imperfections and with competitive market structures, the market mechanism works by 
encouraging new players to enter profitable market segments, and in the process drive out 
excess returns, while the market for corporate control we eds out firms that are 
operationally inefficient or unable to innovate. This appears to be happening.  
There are advantages to having risks being spread more widely throughout the economy, 
a result of the entry and broader participation of new entities in t he financial system. For 
example, compared with banks, new lenders tend to have different risk management and 
investment objectives, which may result in less cyclical provision of credit. But the 
opposite may also be true and there are growing concerns tha t some new activities and 
participants may constitute sources of instability.  
The challenge is to find ways to secure the benefits of new innovations while avoiding the 
hazards. Guidelines on how to do so were put forward some years ago by former Federal 
Reserve Board Chairman, Alan Greenspan, who suggested that policy makers should: 
“Proceed cautiously, facilitate and participate in prudent innovation, allow markets to 
signal the winners and losers among competing technologies and market structures, and 
overall – as the medical profession has advised – do no harm”.  
To operationalise these guidelines requires linking them with the three longstanding 
principal objectives of financial policymaking: ensuring  financial stability, ensuring 
adequate protection for  investor s, and ensuring market integrity.   
Financial innovations raise issues concerning the regulatory perimeter.40 One difficulty 
arises, for example, in situations in which financial arrangements having the same 
intrinsic characteristics can fall outsid e regulatory coverage if they are offered by an 
institution beyond the regulatory perimeter. An example would be a nonbank provider of 
payment services, which would avoid regulations applied to bank providers of the same 
services. Customers clearly derive benefits from having more flexible, mobile payment 
options, so the solution is not to impose capital requirements on the providers. Capital 
requirements exist in part to ensure the integrity of the deposit insurance system and its 
ability to protect deposi tors, as well as ensuring an adequate buffer against losses and 
avoiding any messy failure that becomes contagious. The new payment providers do not 
take deposits. But how does one ensure the systemic integrity of the payments system, 
which has been based largely on the protections inherent in the interbank system?   
The special nature of banking, which derives in part from the contagion effect, tends to 
result in the special application of competition and antitrust policies in the banking sector. 
For stabi lity reasons as noted before, entry and exit conditions in banking are not free and 
open. Deposit taking remains the preserve of depository institutions. But entry into some 
of the other core product areas of commercial banking, like lending, is open.  1. FRAMEWORK FOR DIGITA LISATION IN FINANCE  │ 29 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 Entry is also not free and open in the provision of some types of insurance, but in this 
case on grounds of the need to ensure that financial consumers (including SMEs) and 
investors are adequately informed and protected.41As a consequence, when an entity 
wants  to become licensed as an insurer or as an insurance agent/broker, it faces  
potentially prohibitive capital and/or fit -and-proper requirements that must be met before 
it receives an  authorisation to operate. This requirement is perhaps partly why very few 
InsurTech start -ups have gained insurance underwriting licenses  and are limited mainly to 
broker licenses. 42  
These prudential  requirements are a core component of the policy framework to ensure 
adequate protection of insurance policyholder s. But they can also constitute a barrier to 
new market entry, where applicable.  
Another relevant consideration, similar to the mobile -payment issues in banking services, 
is whether the insurance  regulatory framework should  allow for new insurance products 
that target sp ecific limited risks that are low in value . This is particularly the case in 
emerging economies which can benefit from greater penetration of insurance policies 
while having a limited policyholder impact. But microinsurance  can also be beneficial in 
OECD countries , by providing for increased flexibility and lower transaction costs via 
mobile apps. 
While InsurTech innovations can provide a number of benefits , there are nonetheless a  
number of areas in which greater regulatory  discussion may be required , in particular 
where the  transparency of the technology and the impact on a policyholder’s choice and 
rights is unclear. The same types of data protection issues also arise, along with the 
potential for exclusion of certain segm ents of the population based on data aggregation. 
This is an area that will require closer examination by regulators, as the volume of 
personal data handled by insurers increases and the consensus on its use becomes blurred. 
Ensuring that policyholders are  appropriately protected when the implications of certain 
innovations and technologies are uncertain will be important for regulators.  
These comments imply that structural issues  that are not adapted to a digital world, such 
as local ownership requirements , bank -focused or  insurance -focused regulation , and non -
electronic requirements to comply with “Know -Your -Customer” rules, will tend to 
impede innovation. Consistency of regulatory treatment and interpretation so that 
businesses know how they will be treat ed and can scale -up is a second challenge. Even 
where rules are technically the same, interpretations of their application may differ not 
only across jurisdictions but even within the same jurisdiction.  
The OECD considers that two sets of measures are nee ded to make the financial system 
more resilient and capable of withstanding disruptive financial innovations.43 One set of 
measures relates to improvements in the infrastructure for financial services. Other 
necessary measures are directed at various types of innovations. In the end, the 
Committee agreed on the following recommended steps:  
 Step 1: ensure that the necessary framework conditions for markets to function 
properly are in place  
 Step 2: Acknowledge that there is no one policy measure that can be considered 
optimal in all circumstances  
 Step 3: Ensure that the policy instruments needed to achieve incentive -compatible 
objectives are in the toolkit  
o clarify what is meant by maintaining systemic stability  
o properly address exit problems for large institu tions  30 │ 1. FRAMEWORK FOR DIG ITALISATION IN FINAN CE 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   o establish a proper macro -prudential framework  
o establish a proper framework to ensure adequate protection for consumers  
 Step 4: Ensure regulators and supervisors have the requisite skills and experience  
 Step 5: Ensure a proper balance between regulati on and governance  
 Step 6: Ensure there is appropriate monitoring of new products, markets, and 
processes  
 Step 7: Adapt the regulatory system as necessary to the market environment it is 
intended to regulate  
Many of these components are found in the methods  being undertaken in practice, which 
include, for example, sandboxes,44 accelerators and innovation hubs  to facilitate 
monitoring (Step 6) and calls to assess the regulatory perimeter  and updat e it on a timely 
basis  (Step 7).  
6.  Concluding remarks  
OECD work in the financial area has tended over the years to focus on questions that 
have structural or longer -term implications45, such as changes in the topography of the 
financial system (e.g. the types and sizes of participants, the products and services they 
offer, to which categories of customers, via what types of channels). Examining changes 
in institutional restructuring of markets, as in changes in institutions’ business models, 
has been a core part of this body of work.  
Financial intermediaries, like many firms, are not static entities, but instead evolve in 
response to changes in various factors, some of which are internal to the firm, while 
others, such as changes in the competitive environment and overall economy are external. 
Firms may lose their compar ative advantage in the provision of some products and be 
forced to shed particular lines of business, which in some cases may have been a core part 
of their previous business model . Previously unbundled activities may be rebundled  or 
vice-versa, which coul d result in changes in the size variation of providers .  
International organisations and governments are fully engaged in assessing the 
technology -driven changes in the financial services landscape and determining the 
appropriate policy responses needed to  address these changes. Given the complexity of 
these changes and the numerous interrelated factors involved, the angle with which to 
approach this topic is not necessarily obvious.  
Notes
 
1.  The regulatory framework can either accommodate innovations or endeavour to block them.  
2.  This argument is in line with the OECD (2016) report “Stimulating Digital Innovation for 
Growth and Well -Being” which highlights that “There is evidence that the adoption of ICTs 
have been largely driven via heightened competitive pressure in ICT using sectors (see 
Conway et al., 2006; Agh ion et al., 2008). When comparing Japan and the United States, for 
example, Kushida and Zysman (2013) observe that ICT adoption rates remained lower in 
ICT intensive sectors such as finance, retail, and healthcare in Japan, despite higher 
broadband penetra tion rate. The authors argue that the ICT revolution developed largely in 
the United States instead thanks to “lead users of ICT tools [that] faced newly liberalized 
environments, pressuring them into intense competition”.

40.  There are many examples  of the challenges posed by innovative products. An example from 
the early 1980s relates to US regulations controlling the payment of interest on various 
deposits. The restrictions applied to institutions formally licensed as “depository 
institutions”. Tha t meant that banks and savings and loan associations were subject to the 
restrictions, but the rules did not apply to securities firms, as the latter were not formally 
licensed depository institutions. By the same token, securities firms, not being banks o r 
thrifts, could not technically offer checking accounts, but a number of securities firms took 
advantage of the loophole in the formal definition to create money market mutual funds with 
check -writing privileges, using contractual agreements with partner commercial banks to 
gain legal access to check clearing systems. The products were functionally equivalent to 
bank checking deposits, but were not subject to the same regulatory controls on payment of 
interest and proved to be extremely popular among retai l investors, prompting a considerable 
outflow of deposits from banks and thrifts, which lacked equivalent products to offer.

OECD has also been contributing to the design of the post -crisis regulatory landscape with 
the aim of ensuring a proper balance between financial stability and  growth. This work 
includes promoting long -term investment finance, especially by institutional investors, as 
well as financing SMEs. It also covers issues of financial education (with a large OECD 
International Network on Financial Education (INFE)), comp lemented by work on financial 
consumer protection. Ever more interconnected, complex and global financial markets and 
institutions require enhanced international co -operation – in terms of monitoring, supervision 
and regulation as well as policy responses to crises.  In monitoring financial market 
developments and providing a platform to discuss, analyse and design financial policies, the 
OECD is well placed to contribute to making financial systems not only safer and more 
resilient, but also improve their efficiency and thus their role in fostering economic growth.  2. DIGITALISATION AND P ENSIONS │ 35

 2. Digitalisation and p ensions  
Technology is rapidly transforming the way that the financial sector is operating, and the 
management and delivery of pensions is no exception. Innovative applications of technology for 
financial services, or Fintech , are already being used to improve comm unication with consumers 
and their engagement with their pension plans. While regulators are keen to promote innovative 
ideas that can lead to consumer benefit, they also have to proceed with caution to ensure that 
consumer protection is not overlooked. Ma ny jurisdictions are dedicating significant resources to 
keep up with the rapid technologically -driven changes so that the regulation can strike a balance 
that is both adequate and appropriate in this new environment.  This article provides an overview 
of how technology is being used to improve pension design and delivery and what regulators are 
doing to encourage innovation that will benefit consumers.  
  36 │ 2. DIGITALISATION AND PENSIONS  
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   1.  Introduction  
This article explores the early regulatory implications of the growing role of technology 
in pension provision, and look at what governments are doing more generally to support 
its development for the benefit of consumers.  
Financial innovation enabled by digital technologies  ("Fintech ") and related technological 
developments such as RegTech (us ing technology to facilitate regulatory compliance) 
have the potential to re -shape private pension design and delivery. Individuals are 
increasingly required to make complex choices about their pension finances, and 
consumer engagement with financial servi ces in general  is becoming more digital.  
Fintech  can improve the ways in which pension providers interact with individual 
members: enhanced communication techniques can encourage greater engagement; 
digital disclosure can reduce compliance costs; robo -advice can make financial planning 
more accessible. New technologies are also relevant to pension providers’ internal 
processes, including product design, transaction processing, risk management and 
compliance. The improvements in efficiency that technology a llows can also translate 
into lower costs both for pension providers and for members.  
Reliance on technology can also create new risks. Less educated and less well -paid 
workers might be excluded from technological progress because they cannot or will not 
engage with new methods of communicating. Non -regulated entities from other sectors 
might cherry -pick some aspects of pension provision, leaving traditional players with less 
profitable businesses and creating regulatory risks. There are also concerns over data 
protection and data security as well as consumer protection issues relating to the 
suitability of the services and products offered.  
Regulation  must therefore achieve a balance between the objective of encouraging the 
development of Fintech -enabled s olutions to benefit consumers and that of  ensuring 
adequate protection against the potential risks  to consumers . Several jurisdictions have 
been addressing this balance through programmes that intend to work directly with 
providers to foster and encourage the development of Fintech -enabled services, while at 
the same time closely monitoring and mitigating the potential risks that emerge in the 
process. These types of programmes go by several names, but typically include those 
referred to as innovation hubs,  Fintech  accelerators or incubators, and regulatory 
sandboxes. Such programmes can be useful tools to ensure that the financial consumer 
risks presented by technological innovations are mitigated while also ensuring that 
protections in place do not inadver tently stifl e innovation, thereby maximising the 
ultimate benefit for consumers.   
The key findings of this article are:  
 Fintech  applications are increasing the accessibility of investing in pensions to a 
broader consumer base and making communications with  pension savers more 
effective.  
 Fintech  is increasing the efficiency of the operation of pension schemes through 
risk management applications, the automation of investment processes and the 
facilitation of regulatory compliance.  
 Governments are making sub stantial efforts to support the development of 
Fintech .  
 Innovation Hubs are becoming a key component in regulatory support to help 
new businesses understand how existing regulation applies to their ideas.  2. DIGITALISATION AND P ENSIONS │ 37

2.  Using technology to enhance interactions with pension members  
Fintech  is being deployed across a range of financial ser vices to enhance interactions with 
consumers. Fintech  can help to increase trust in financial products, by making them more 
accessible, transparent and comprehensible. It can improve data collection and analysis, 
aiding product design and personalisation. It can encourage participation in financial 
decisions through gamification and education. These developments are likely to be 
especially valuable in interactions with millennials, who expect to use technology to 
access financial services and who are now en tering the workforce.  
Financial advice is the area where the impact of Fintech  is most evident. Although its 
primary application is currently in wealth management, insurance companies are also 
adopting the technology. Robo -advice is generally cheaper and m ore accessible than 
“human” advice and so could be especially useful for DC plans where members are faced 
with a number of financial choices and where accumulated savings may be relatively 
small. According to the UK Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser, Fintech  companies 
can increase the availability of financial advice to previously under -served populations, 
thanks to their “lower cost structures, greater customer reach or superior ability to 
monitor or score risk”.  
Digital communications  
Fintech  can hel p to generate member engagement through the use of digital technologies 
in communications, including periodic reporting, marketing communications and other 
information. Digital communications can involve simply the storage and delivery of 
documents electro nically, or it can involve “smart” communications, which use of other 
media, gamification, personalisation, or interactivity to attract readers.  38 │ 2. DIGITALISATION AND PENSIONS  
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   The trend away from paper documentation and towards electronic communications is being 
recognised by regulator s, who increasingly permit financial service providers to use 
electronic communications as the default option for regulatory disclosure. For example, the 
SEC allows mutual funds to post their prospectus on line, and ASIC (Australia) has a 
“publish and noti fy” regime. Electronic communications are cheaper than printed 
communications and it is easier to track who has received and read them. However, digital 
disclosure poses certain risks in terms of disclosure standards: framing of the information is 
importan t so that readers are not distracted from the most relevant information by additional 
features. Providers could face liability risks if there is a discrepancy between the framing of 
the printed information and the electronic information. Regulators may the refore need to 
provide best -practice guides for digital disclosure to help make sure that consumers will 
read and understand the most relevant information.  
Overall, digital technologies are likely to enhance the quality and effectiveness of 
interactions be tween pension providers and their members. Smart communications can 
take advantage of behavioural insights; for example, by using push notifications to nudge 
people into checking their balances or increasing contributions. The UK Competition and 
Market Aut hority’s inquiry on personal current accounts found that “annual interest 
statements have virtually no effect on consumer actions, but given immediately 
actionable information – text alerts and internet banking – overdraft charges can be 
reduced by consume rs by almost 25%.”  Fintech  enables on -demand interaction between 
pension providers and their members outside the regulatory reporting periods. In 
Australia, members of superannuation schemes can access their accounts through a 
mobile phone app; in the UK,  Aviva’s Shape My Future app provides online tools and 
calculators to help members visualise their lifestyle in retirement.  
Platforms and dashboards  
Digital technologies could also encourage greater transparency and allow people to 
manage their own data m ore efficiently, ultimately increasing their bargaining power and 
lowering the cost of private pensions (especially personal pensions). E -aggregators 
facilitate comparison sites or allow people to aggregate and analyse their own data. 
Ultimately, individua ls might be able to manage all their finances from a single platform.  
A number of countries have created “pensions dashboards” to give members and 
beneficiaries an easy -to-use overview of their likely pension finances (see Box 1). These 
dashboards vary in terms of the depth of the data they contain and the functionality they 
offer, but research indicates that they can be a powerful tool for transmitting information, 
encouraging people to take action, and in particular for keeping track of multiple pension 
pots as individuals move between several different employers. There are considerable 
technical challenges and costs in building a dashboard, however, and policy 
considerations include both funding and governance in addition to functionality. For 
example, wh ether the dashboard should be funded by the private sector or whether 
advertising should be allowed need to be considered.  
As for digital disclosure, it is important to ensure that such platforms do not lead to less 
engagement or encourage members to skip  important information. For example, plans to 
launch an auto -consolidation of small DC pots on Australia’s pensions dashboard were 
postponed because inactive accounts in some cases offered better protection than active 
accounts; users of pension dashboards  should be given all the relevant information as well 
as a simple “one click” option to take action.  2. DIGITALISATION AND P ENSIONS │ 39

 Box 1. Pensions Dashboards  
A pensions dashboard provides a one -stop shop for individuals to see their pension situation. 
Depending on the functionality of  the dashboard, they can see their public and private pension 
entitlements, compare different private schemes, enter personal information (such as a change of 
address) just once for transmission to multiple providers, receive regulatory and marketing 
commu nications, compare different payout options, and consolidate small pots.  
While dashboards can provide considerable utility to both pension providers and pension 
members, and bring transparency, a number of questions need to be addressed in setting them 
up: 
 Cost: upfront costs may be paid by the government or private providers; ongoing 
costs will ultimately be borne by members unless private sponsorship or advertising 
is permitted, which raises consumer protection and competition issues.  
 Technical challenges : individual records will need to be cleaned, standardised and 
digitised.  
 Quality and scope of information : the content and display of information needs to be 
controlled so that individuals are not tempted into making a decision such as 
consolida tion on the basis of attractively -displayed but incomplete information.  
AUSTRALIA  
The Australian Tax Office portal provides up -to-date valuations of all an individual’s super 
accounts and of any unclaimed money in “lost” accounts. Individuals can trigger  the process of 
consolidation on the portal. It is estimated that streamlining processes and consolidating smaller 
pots could save AUSD 1 billion per year in running costs.  
THE NETHERLANDS  
The government set up a website in 2011 to increase engagement and  awareness of pension 
entitlements. It includes information on state and occupational pension rights on both a gross and 
net of tax basis. Occupational schemes are legally required to provide data, but information and 
functionality are relatively limited, though a pension simulator may be included in the future. Work 
is also being conducted to look at the feasibility of including personal pensions.  
SWEDEN  
The minpension site was established in 2004 and has evolved to provide real -time information 
about sta te and DB pensions, the current value of pension entitlements, a projection of retirement 
income and a simulator to model changes in the projection at different retirement ages. Around 
half of eligible users are registered with the site and data suggests t hat people are most likely to 
use the site as they get close to retirement age.  
UNITED KINGDOM  
The government has set a goal of establishing a pensions dashboard by 2019 where individuals 
would be able to view all of their pension pots, including state pe nsions, in one place. As a 
preliminary step, the government has launched a pension finding service to help individuals easily 
locate unclaimed pensions. An initial prototype of what the dashboard could look like has also 
been developed in collaboration wit h the industry. Participation by the industry has not yet been 
mandated, however, and it is not clear how the project will be funded.

Scheme management  
Fintech  can also help to facilitate pension scheme administration and risk management, 
particularly for smaller plan sponsors who may have fewer resources and could benefit 
the most from lower costs and improved efficiency. For example, Fintech  has been used 
to create platforms to facilitate the management of pension schemes for employers by 
providing a digital auto -enrolment platform (see Figure 1). These are especially useful for 
small employers who may not have the resources or expertise to select a scheme or 
connect it with their payroll systems.  
Figure  1. Digital Auto -Enrolment Platform Example  
 
Fintech  can also facilitate risk management for pension providers. Financial software 
such as RiskFirst gives smaller pension schemes access to the same risk managem ent and 
reporting tools as larger schemes. Improved risk estimates and forecasting could be 
particularly powerful in avoiding large downward swings in DC pots, for example.  
New analytical techniques and big data could lead to the creation of more efficient  and 
more personalised retirement solutions, in particular for the pay -out phase.  Financial data 
and analytics improve our understanding of consumers and their savings and spending 
habits, therefore solutions for financing retirement could be better tailo red to individuals’ 
specific circumstances.  
Investment management  
Lowering investment costs is recognised as an important contributor to increased 
portfolio returns. Fintech  is helping to reduce the cost of portfolio management, through 
low-cost investmen t products such as bespoke tracker funds and automatic portfolio 
rebalancing and algorithmic trading. Several robo -advice firms are positioning 
themselves as business -to-business operations, offering automated portfolio management 
services to businesses pr oviding pensions for their employees. Direct trading between

 players on the buy side, especially in the corporate bond market, are helping to offset the 
decline in market making as investment banks withdraw liquidity, but in doing so they 
transfer trading risks to investors and make markets less transparent, so may need 
additional supervision. Fintech  is also enabling the emergence of entirely new asset 
classes, such as peer -to-peer lending.

Regulatory compliance  
Technological applications can support risk management and compliance through making 
Management Information Systems, compliance monitoring and risk training more 
efficient and transparent. Technology can support labo ur-intensive regulatory and 
compliance processes such as real -time transaction analysis, online registration, risk -
weighted asset calculations, data analytics and aggregation; modelling, scenario analysis 
and forecasting; monitoring internal culture and be haviour and complying with customer 
protection processes. Data -mining algorithms can organise and analyse large sets of data, 
including qualitative data such as e -mails and recordings.  
Technology could also facilitate data sharing between regulators withi n or across 
jurisdictions, or the creation of open -source compliance tools, although this would require 
harmonisation of data. As financial regulation requires more and more data, new 
technologies might help to streamline both data capture and data analysi s. New 
mathematical tools could lead to more powerful risk models; emerging techniques such as 
agent -based modelling to simulate the likely impact of new policies such as MiFID II 
before they are introduced; while smart contracts (computer protocols that c an self -
execute, self -verify and self -constrain the performance of a contract) could reduce the 
need for some areas of supervision.  
Blockchain  
Many of the technologies described above rely on blockchain, or distributed ledger, 
technology (Box 1.2). Althou gh the application of blockchain to pensions is so far 
limited, it has potential use in dashboards, trading and many Regtech solutions.   
42 │ 2. DIGITALISATION AND PENSIONS  
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   Box 2. Blockchain Technology  
Blockchain – or distributed ledger – technology makes it possible to connect multiple 
parties to each other without passing through intermediaries. These multiple parties all 
have access to identical copies of a digital record (for example, a contract or t ransaction 
data), they can update these records to register a transaction that has taken place and 
have their amendments validated by the other parties in close to real time.  
This makes transactions cheaper and in some ways safer. For example, company sha res 
can be traded by investors without passing through multiple custodians, as the 
shareholder register can be updated directly once an exchange takes place between 
buyer and seller. The existence of multiple copies of the transaction means that there is 
less risk of a single systems failure reversing the transaction. Once validated, 
transactions cannot be reversed.  
Distributed ledger technology is potentially applicable to a number of aspects of pensions:  
PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT - Trading (including bespoke derivatives contracts), 
reconciliations, foreign exchange management, portfolio rebalancing and proxy voting 
could all be made more efficient through the use of dedicated blockchains.  
COMPLIANCE - Blockchain would facilitate many aspects of pensions admin istration, 
such as automated identification solutions (KYC) and data recording and transfers. By 
giving sponsors, trustees and tax authorities access to a unified, tamper -proof database, 
the need for reconciliation of transfers/contributions would be sharp ly reduced.  
DASHBOARDS - Dashboards that allow transactions, such as consolidating multiple 
pots, could use this technology.

3. The impact of technology on business models  
Technology is changing business models in financial organisations in two main ways. 
Within internal operations, it is leading to disintermediation between front, middle and 
back offices. Within commercial operations, it is changing consumer behaviour and so  
forcing adaptation by providers. These trends are already evident in other financial 
institutions but they are likely to affect pension providers in the future. De Nederlandsche 
Bank suggests how insurers might be faced with new types of competition for c ertain 
parts of their business, making them less able to bear the cost of their legacy books  
(DNB, 2016 [4]). 
Incumbent pension providers may be at a disadvantage to newer players in exploiting new 
technologies, because they are constrained by existing IT infrastructure that is expensive 
to change or replace. This could enable new entrants with lower costs to ente r some areas 
of pension provision, as has already been seen in the area of advice. As an example of the 
potential costs of upgrading legacy systems, UBS is reported to have invested USD 1 
billion in redesigning processes across its wealth management operat ions to introduce 
robo-advice in the UK.   
Fintech  is bringing increased transparency and a greater use of comparison sites. This 
trend could lead to pressure on pension providers to provide more granular reporting on 
their cost structures and the fees the y charge, ultimately leading to a drop in pricing.  2. DIGITALISATION AND P ENSIONS │ 43 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 4. Risks associated with  the greater use of technology  
Each of the potential advantages of Fintech  carries corresponding risks. Some of these 
risks are not new, although they may be more acute because of the applications of new 
technologies, for example data security and privacy risks. Fintech  also has the potential to 
create new types of risk, such as structural changes in the financial services industry and 
the entry of non -regulated players. Regulators may wish to impose new training 
requirements on pension providers, sponsors and trustees to address Fintech  risks as well 
as build their own internal capacities to supervise these risks.  
In the area of interaction with members, there are a number of potent ial risks. Fintech  
could aggravate financial exclusion for those who do not engage with digital 
communications; conversely, there is some concern that consumers will place too much 
trust in technological solutions and so the fall -out from any problems with  Fintech  will be 
particularly damaging. One example of this is crowd funding, where small investors 
might take more risk than with traditional investment products.  
Data privacy and security risks are heightened with the introduction of technologies that 
rely on the capture, storage and analysis of large quantities of data in order to provide 
improved services. Fintech  providers that use cloud -based IT services may pu t data 
beyond the reach of regulators.  
Technological advances may lead to a greater degree of advice from and outsourcing to 
specialised providers, for example enhanced analytics companies. These companies may 
fall outside the scope of pensions regulators,  but a failure by them could have negative 
consequences for confidence in private pensions.  
5. Regulatory approaches to Fintech  
Regulation of Fintech  has to strike a balance between encouraging innovation in order to 
reap the potential benefits of lower co sts, improved transparency and higher consumer 
engagement, providing space for the evolution of business models, and ensuring that 
consumers are protected and incumbents are not faced with unfair competition from non -
regulated entities. It also needs to be  adaptive in order to accommodate the impacts of 
future, unanticipated technological developments and encourage knowledge -sharing 
between regulators, supervisors, incumbents and potential new entrants to the pensions 
industry.  
Regulators also need to be vi gilant that the benefits of technology are indeed passed on to 
pension members and beneficiaries. Philippon argues that the financial services industry 
has so far kept IT efficiency gains for itself, and that the role of the Regulator is to ensure 
that dis ruption is allowed to take place (Philippon, 2017 [5]). The regulatory framework 
needs to accommodate such disruption and ensure that the same rules are applicable for 
both new entrants and incumbents.  
Government sponsored progr ammes to support innovations in the provision of financial 
services have been implemented in numerous jurisdictions. The ultimate objective of 
these programmes is to ensure that innovation is encouraged, that these developments are 
in consumers' interests,  and finally that any consumer risks resulting from these 
innovations are adequately mitigated and financial consumer protection ensured.  44 │ 2. DIGITALISATION AND PENSIONS  
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   These programmes can intervene in various stages of an idea's development, from the 
initial brainstorming phase to th e implementation or even expansion of the resulting 
product or service:  
 Idea stage : to promote the generation of ideas to improve the provision of 
financial services and benefit consumers  
 Compliance stage : to facilitate the identification of applicable reg ulations and the 
process of compliance  
 Financing stage : to facilitate the raising of capital to fund the implementation of 
the project  
 Implementation stage : to provide a controlled and safe environment for testing 
the idea in the market and to use the feed back and information learned to adapt 
product offering or regulation which may be inadequate or inappropriately 
constrictive  
 Expansion stage : to facilitate the exportation of the idea to other markets and 
allow consumers to benefit more rapidly  
These stage s of development are not necessarily chronological and the programmes 
offered may span several stages of development, which is often the case for incubator -
type programmes which offer end -to-end services. Programmes may also target specific 
stages, such as  an agreement between two jurisdictions to facilitate cross -border 
expansion.  
While the criteria for a Fintech  candidate to participate in these types of programmes 
generally includes having an innovative idea that will improve financial services for 
consumers and result in a tangible consumer benefit, the types of participants targeted 
may vary across jurisdictions. Some programmes explicitly target start -ups, such as the 
10,000 Start -up programme in India, while others favour developments by incumbents 
such as banks, as is the case in Hong Kong, China. Many programmes, however, are open 
to any market participant having an innovative idea to benefit consumers and improve 
financial services with technology.  
The sections below provide some details on the spe cific types of support that various 
programmes can offer in each stage of the Fintech 's development.  
Idea stage  
Several jurisdictions have developed programmes or incentives to engage with the 
industry and to encourage ideas to be put forward for the appli cation of technology to 
solve certain challenges observed in the market and to benefit consumers. These 
initiatives typically take the form of a network or community which facilitates the 
exchange of ideas, support to vet ideas for specific applications in  financial services, or 
organised competitions to develop concrete Fintech  solutions to specific challenges.  
A few governments have established or funded efforts to facilitate idea generation and 
communication to capture the potential benefits that technol ogy can offer to financial 
consumers and engage in discussions with the industry. The Hong Kong Monetary 
Authority has created a Fintech  Facilitation Office, which includes a dedicated platform 
to liaise with the Fintech  sector. This platform facilitates t he exchange of ideas among 
stakeholders to find applications of technology for financial services. It also initiates 
research with the industry on specific applications of Fintech , for example the application 
of blockchain technology to financial services.  The Belgium government sponsors the 
“B-hive”, a platform intended to facilitate innovation and the liaison between traditional 2. DIGITALISATION AND P ENSIONS │ 45 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 financial service providers and Fintech  start-ups. Australia has established a digital 
advisory committee made up of industry re presentatives, academics and consumer 
representatives to provide feedback on how the regulators/supervisors are engaging with 
the sector and to identify which issues are the most important to address. Canada has a 
similar committee, and also invites ventur e capitalist and tech experts to the table to 
understand the challenges they face with particular regulations.  
Other governments have established dedicated support for businesses to bring solutions to 
solve particular market challenges and benefit consumer s. The Advice Unit established 
by the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom is one such an initiative. The 
Advice Unit provides regulatory feedback and published resources for businesses 
developing models to provide automated advice, either in the form of a personalised 
recommendation or through automated investment management services. Businesses 
wishing to benefit from the service must meet a number of criteria, including the potential 
for lower cost services, consumer benefit and a clear and well thought -out proposal.  
Another emerging trend is to host Fintech  competitions, commonly referred to as 
“hackathons”, to generate ideas for solving specific challenges presented in financial 
markets, including those related to financial consumer protect ion. While more common in 
the private sector, one of the first government sponsored events was the TechSprint 
sponsored by the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK, a two -day event where market 
players came together to develop ideas to use technology to i mprove the efficiency and 
effectiveness of financial regulation. More recently, the Canadian securities regulator 
sponsored a hackathon for Fintech  applications for regulatory compliance, Know -Your -
Customer requirements and improving financial literacy. Th e United Arab Emirates has 
sponsored a virtual hackathon for applications of blockchain technology, with one 
objective being the reduction of financial fraud and cybercrimes.  
Compliance stage  
Assisting businesses in understanding the regulatory requirement s applicable to their 
business idea is the most common approach governments have used to encourage 
innovation in financial services and ensure that appropriate consumer protections are in 
place. Such services or programmes are commonly called “innovation h ubs”, Fintech  
incubators or Fintech  accelerators, though there is no universally agreed definition across 
jurisdictions.  The goal of these services is to help Fintech  companies understand how the 
regulation applies to their ideas and to facilitate the reg istration or licensing process, 
which can significantly reduce start -up costs and time -to-market. These services often 
operate based on a 'hub and spoke' model (e.g. Australia, Canada, United Kingdom), with 
a dedicated team being the central point of conta ct who can refer specific issues to 
relevant contacts in other departments as need be.  
This approach helps to ensure that the business models are compliant with requirements 
put in place to protect consumers. Often, the regulators/supervisors will also tr y to reach 
out to and engage with market participants who may not realise that the activity they are 
engaging in is subject to regulation. The OSC in Canada, for example, provides a website 
that uses plain language (no legalese) and provides plain examples  of how securities law 
may apply, and issues media releases to make participants aware of required regulation 
where a lack of awareness has been observed for a specific type of situation.  
An example of a dedicated team is the Innovation Hub in the United K ingdom, which is 
dedicated to working on innovation and supporting the growth of Fintech s. The 
Innovation Hub provides qualified applicants with a dedicated advisor who sees them 46 │ 2. DIGITALISATION AND PENSIONS  
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   through the compliance process, identifying the relevant aspects of the regul atory regime, 
facilitating the application for authorisation, and providing support for up to a year 
following authorisation.  
Short of having a dedicated advisor, most jurisdictions with a programme in place to 
support innovation in financial services will  at least provide a service to help aspiring 
innovators to understand the applicable regulations. This is true in Abu Dhabi, Australia, 
Brazil, Canada, France, Hong Kong, China, Indonesia, and the Netherlands, for example.  
Financing stage  
While not as common, governments may also provide assistance for innovators to raise 
capital or cover the costs for the development of their projects, with the end -goal that 
these projects will ultimately benefits consumers. The B -hive platform in Belgium, for 
example,  facilitates the creation of partnerships between start -ups and traditional market 
players to help the business concepts scale -up their idea. The programme 10,000 Start -
ups in India, supported by the government, helps innovators by providing direct access to 
venture capital and angel investors. In France, innovators can have access to government 
grants or contracts which will help to ensure future revenues. The French government 
may also help with operational costs by providing office space, for example. Th e Abu 
Dhabi Global Market assists start -ups connect with potential investors and helps them 
with logistical resources.  
Implementation stage  
Programmes which offer support for the implementation of the innovative idea are most 
often in the form of what has become commonly known as a regulatory sandbox. The 
principle of the sandbox is to provide a controlled environment in which the business idea 
can be tested in real time and where some licensing and/or regulatory requirements may 
be relaxed. It also provide s a safe environment for the idea to be tested where risks to 
consumers are controlled. This not only speeds up the time -to-market, but provides 
valuable feedback both to the participant and to the regulator as to how the regulation 
does and should apply, including rules relating to consumer protection. This feedback can 
then be used to either adapt the product or service offering, or to adapt the regulation 
itself. As such, these services are typically reserved for innovative business models for 
which ther e is no direct precedent as to how the regulation should apply, as these types of 
ideas require more interactive support. The participating businesses also need to have 
considered potential risks to consumers and how to mitigate them.  
Jurisdictions which h ave implemented a sandbox -type approach (date of launch in 
parentheses) include Australia (Dec. 2016), Bahrain (June 2017), Canada (Oct. 2016), 
Hong Kong, China (Sept. 2016), Indonesia (Nov. 2016), Iran (Dec. 2016), Malaysia (Oct. 
2016), the Netherlands (J an. 2017), Thailand (Oct. 2016), Singapore (Nov. 2016), United 
Arab Emirates (Nov. 2016) and the United Kingdom (May 2016). China has also 
announced that it will launch a regulatory sandbox.  
One type of flexibility that sandboxes may offer is relaxed regis tration or licensing 
requirements. The sandbox in the United Kingdom allows participants a temporary form 
of authorisation which allows them to try their idea within a defined period of time, after 
which they may apply for full authorisation. In Abu Dhabi,  firms are allowed to operate 
in the 'RegLab' for up to two years without a traditional license, but may be subject to 
limitations such as the number of products, types of consumers, size of transactions and 
the geographies where products and services are offered. The Netherlands allows for 2. DIGITALISATION AND P ENSIONS │ 47 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 'light' licensing requirements, granting temporary licensees to test -run ideas. Australia has 
issued a licensing exemption for businesses offering products to a small number of clients 
or for small amounts, and also offe rs modular licensing, where participants can be 
licenced to provide specific services and/or products.  
Sandboxes may also have the power to relax certain regulatory and compliance 
requirements. In the United Kingdom, certain rules can be 'switched off', a llowing the 
business to freely test their ideas, albeit within an agreed set of parameters. A 'no 
enforcement' action may also be offered, so that in the event the product does not work 
the supervisor will not take enforcement again against the company. Wh ile not officially 
a 'sandbox', the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued its policy on innovation 
in February 2016, which establishes a process for Fintech  companies to proactively seek 
‘No Action’ letters so that regulatory uncertainty does not hinder innovation.  
The OSC Launchpad in Canada and the RegLab of the Abu Dhabi Global Market have 
the power to tailor regulations for individual companies. In Hong Kong, China, 
compliance requirements can be relaxed to allow banks to experiment with new i deas, 
and Singapore allows new products to be offered to consumers that are subject to relaxed 
compliance rules for a limited amount of time. In Iran, regulation and tax rules can be 
relaxed for start -ups. The Astana International Finance Centre planned in  Kazakhstan will 
offer flexible regulations for start -ups. Where principles -based regulations apply, 
providing another interpretation as to how the regulation should apply may be sufficient 
and a modification of the rule may not be necessary.   
As relaxing licensing and compliance requirements can potentially expose consumers to 
additional risks, other measures can be taken or controls put in place to ensure that 
adequate consumer protections are in place. In the United Kingdom, applicants must f irst 
be qualified to offer the product or service. The process also requires that the innovators 
have a dedicated advisor to follow the process and check the outcomes. In the event that 
consumers are harmed from a product or service being tested, the compa ny is required to 
provide redress to the consumer to avoid enforcement action. Also, certain rules, such as 
suitability requirements, may not be allowed to be relaxed. In Australia companies must 
maintain basic requirements such as having professional inde mnity insurance, joining an 
approved external dispute resolution service and meet conduct and disclosure obligations 
such as best interest standards for advice and responsible lending obligations for credit. 
Senior executives may also be required to have p revious financial services experience. In 
Malaysia, requirements relating to confidentiality, appropriate handling of assets and anti -
money laundering must be adhered to.  
Following the observations during the testing of the product or service, lessons lea rned 
may be used to adapt existing regulation to ensure that appropriately accommodates the 
new business model or product while maintaining adequate levels of consumer 
protection. The OSC Launchpad in Canada, for example, uses this feedback to modernise 
regulations and remove the pain points for these businesses.  
Expansion stage  
Governments are increasingly putting agreements in place which facilitate the expansion 
of innovative and successful ideas that benefit consumers into new markets. These may 
take th e form of agreements to fast -track the application process to participate in the 
innovation hubs of other jurisdictions or platforms to facilitate the exchange of 
information or ideas across jurisdictions.  48 │ 2. DIGITALISATION AND PENSIONS  
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   Some jurisdictions have entered into agreements wh ich directly facilitate businesses from 
one market to enter into another. The Financial Conduct Authority in the United 
Kingdom has made bilateral agreements with Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, China and 
Singapore which allows each jurisdiction to refer Fintech firms to the other, which 
enables the firms to more quickly test their ideas in the new market. A French initiative in 
Korea has launched the "French Tech Seoul", which facilitates the entry of Fintech  
entrepreneurs from one market into the other. In the same vein, the B -hive of Belgium has 
signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Innovative Finance, the trade body for 
Britain's Fintech  sector, facilitating collaboration between the two bodies. The Abu Dhabi 
Global Market has established a Fintech  bridge with the Monetary Authority of Singapore 
to establish a strategic framework to assist innovators to understand the respective 
regimes and provide support in the authorisation process and facilitate joint innovation 
projects.  
Agreements facilitating mor e general collaboration and the exchange of information 
relating to Fintech  innovations are also becoming more common. An agreement between 
the United Kingdom and Korea allows the regulators of the two jurisdictions to more 
easily share information regardi ng emerging trends, innovative ideas and regulatory 
issues. Such agreements can also help to identify and share any emerging risks to 
consumers which may result. Australia has signed a similar agreement with Kenya, 
Indonesia and Singapore.  
6. Challenges t o implementing successful programmes to support the development 
of Fintech  
There are numerous challenges to successfully implementing programmes to support the 
development of Fintech . These challenges relate to the motivation for developing such 
programmes  and their focus, and having appropriate rules in place and ensuring the 
effective functioning of such programmes.  
The first challenge that oversight bodies may have to address before establishing a 
programme to support the development of Fintech  is the ne ed to ensure there is sufficient 
scope within their existing mandate to do so. The Financial Conduct Authority in the 
United Kingdom is unique in having a mandate to promote competition in the financial 
markets, and it uses this mandate to support its regu latory sandbox programme as a way 
to encourage innovative new entrants into the market. A more common mandate for 
oversight bodies is to promote market efficiency, which many jurisdictions felt was 
sufficient to allow them to take measures to support busin esses with innovative ideas 
using technology in a way which would reduce the firms’ operating costs and in turn the 
costs for consumers. Nevertheless, even just having a mandate for consumer protection 
should be sufficient in many cases to support those bu sinesses which are rendering costs 
that are typically very opaque for consumers, such as the spreads charged on currency 
exchange rates, more transparent.  
The culture of the organisation also plays a role in the extent to which programmes will 
be able to s uccessfully interact with Fintech  businesses. Many programmes are centred on 
a hub which offers direct support to the businesses. However, while these hubs will 
certainly be geared towards technology and innovation, new businesses will ultimately 
still hav e to interact with other areas of the organisation to ensure their ideas are 
implemented and become operational. The hub therefore also needs to engage with other 
areas of the organisation to help spread the type of culture which embraces change and 
innova tion and get the buy -in from senior executives in all areas of the organisation. 2. DIGITALISATION AND P ENSIONS │ 49 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 Having this buy -in may also help to overcome the functional and practical constraints that 
come with the necessity of having many different types of knowledge and functions 
involved in the process. Professional biases may contribute to the difficulty in cultural 
adaptation, so additional human resources may need to be called upon, ones who not only 
have experience in technology but also have a better understanding of the potent ial risks 
involved. The language used to communicate with companies may also need to be 
adapted to facilitate understanding. In this context, several jurisdictions are making an 
effort to simplify the language used on websites to avoid “legalese” and make the 
application of the regulations clearer.  
Another challenge is finding the right balance to allow regulatory barriers to be lowered 
without compromising on the core principles of the regulatory framework. Given the 
speed of the evolution in this area, t he framework in place needs to be nimble enough to 
facilitate growth while ensuring that the risks are mitigated effectively. Technology and 
innovations are also being directed at reducing frictions in transactions. However, 
eliminating all frictions may n ot be desirable as this could result in reduced consumer 
engagement and attention with respect to the transactions that they are executing and 
which they may not fully understand.  
Clarity in regulation is clearly desirable but not always so easy to achieve . Many 
unanswered questions remain about how certain innovations should be regulated, such as 
the legal issues around the use of distributed ledger technology or settlement finality. Yet 
it is very difficult to keep pace with the changes arising from innov ation to make sure that 
this clarity can be provided effectively without unnecessarily slowing down the pace of 
innovation.  
Numerous challenges also present themselves for the effective functioning of these 
programmes. First is whether the necessary struct ures and rules are in place. Structural 
issues which are not adapted to a digital world such as local ownership requirements, 
bank -focused regulation, and non -electronic requirements to comply with “Know -Your -
Customer” rules will impede innovation. Consist ency of regulatory treatment and 
interpretation so that businesses know how they will be treated and can scale -up is a 
second challenge. Even where rules are technically the same, interpretations of their 
application may differ not only across jurisdiction s but even within the same jurisdiction. 
The target of these programmes may also be unclear, as the term Fintech  lumps together 
many concepts, such that it is not always apparent what is meant, which works against 
developing a consistent focus and approach  to oversight. The programmes need to be 
designed to work for innovative businesses that come in myriad forms and sizes.  
A final challenge is the limited resources available to the regulator or oversight body. If 
the demand for regulatory support and tailo red regulations exceeds the resource capacity 
of regulators and supervisors, the regulatory body will not be able keep up with demand 
and scaling these programmes could prove difficult. Industry led solutions, such as the 
industry sandbox being proposed by  Innovate Finance, could potentially help to meet 
some of this demand, but would still require the active involvement of regulators.  
Insights and suggestions to help make programmes successful  
The suggestions made by participants at the roundtable to effec tively support the 
development of innovation in finance centred around some key themes: culture, 
engagement and capacity.  50 │ 2. DIGITALISATION AND PENSIONS  
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   First, regulators/supervisors need to shift their organisational culture to be more accepting 
of and adaptable to innovation and chang e. Having a dedicated team is just the first step 
towards achieving such a cultural shift in this new environment. The support of senior 
executive leaders of relevant business teams is also important for the success of this team 
and to support the alignmen t of outcomes for the regulator. Regulators and supervisors 
also need to learn from their interaction and experience with these programmes, and adapt 
their approach and/or regulations where necessary.  
Another way to help achieve a cultural shift is to try to approach regulation through a lens 
of consumer benefit in addition to consumer risks. Such a shift in focus could also inform 
resource allocation. Measures of success of regulatory efforts could be used which align 
with this focus, such as measures of p rice or consumer satisfaction.  
Engagement should be another priority. The engagement of regulators/supervisors with 
both internal and external stakeholders at the various stages of a business's development 
is crucial for regulators/supervisors to keep up with developments and to define their role 
within the Fintech  ecosystem. Their role and objectives in supporting the development of 
Fintech  will be defined in terms of their mandate. Having a mandate to promote 
competition is not necessarily needed in orde r for the regulator to play a role in this 
ecosystem. Rather, even just having a mandate for consumer protection should provide 
them with the means to encourage more consumer -friendly business models and 
transparent fee structures. Engaging with stakeholde rs will help them to identify where 
these objectives can align with their mandate, and internal engagement within the 
regulatory body can promote an integrated approach.  
Engagement with external stakeholders will aid regulators/supervisors in building their 
knowledge and keeping up with new developments. Several jurisdictions have established 
Fintech  advisory committees, which gather financial, technology and policy expert s as 
well as stakeholders who may provide a source of funding. Such forums are useful to 
understand the challenges the industry is facing and the potential regulatory barriers that 
may exist.  
Engagement with start -ups from a very early stage can facilitate  communication and limit 
unnecessary costs of compliance. With early engagement, start -ups can build in the 
expected controls, for example, which could become quite expensive to implement at a 
later stage. Making an effort to engage with new businesses wil l also help to establish a 
common language and help these businesses to understand the regulator's expectations 
and requirements. Many jurisdictions have also observed that such engagement helps 
make firms more willing to be regulated and to embrace regula tion as a means to gain 
consumer confidence and ultimately help their business expand. Furthermore, more 
regulatory focus and support could give investors more confidence to invest and thereby 
contribute to the growth of the sector, even though the financi al sector remains more 
regulated than other sectors.  
Inter -regulatory engagement will also be critical to improve the consistency of regulations 
and the consistency of their interpretation. While many participants acknowledged that 
having the same rules in  all jurisdictions is not a realistic expectation at this stage, they 
also lamented the lack of consistent interpretation and application even within Europe for 
rules implemented at the European level.  
Finally, the new environment may call for new ways to engage with market participants 
and increase regulatory capacity. While regulatory sandboxes are a positive development 
and have been well received by industry participants, participants also acknowledged the 2. DIGITALISATION AND P ENSIONS │ 51 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 difficulty in scaling up these types of solutio ns given the resource constraints faced by 
regulators/supervisors. Industry -led sandboxes could help to address these constraints and 
provide a solution to solve shared problems across the industry with the 
regulators/supervisors and help provide them with  a good vantage point to follow 
developments. Nevertheless, regulatory involvement would remain a necessary 
component. Other formats to ensure that the design of policy is effective could also be 
envisaged. The traditional approach of issuing written consu ltations on proposed 
regulation may not effectively engage new market participants who could be most 
affected by the rules. One proposed solution was for the regulator to host hands -on 
workshops with industry participants to design policy that works for re al-world cases.  
7. Key takeaways  
The way in which pensions are set up, managed and delivered to consumers is 
transforming with the increased use and applications of technology. Fintech  applications 
are increasing the accessibility of investing in pensions to a broader consumer base and 
making communications with pension savers more effective. Fintech  is also increasing 
the efficiency of the operation of pension schemes through risk management applications, 
the automation of investment processes and the faci litation of regulatory compliance.  
Overall, governments' efforts to support the development of Fintech  and the benefits this 
can bring to consumers is a positive trend. Several jurisdictions have successfully hosted 
brainstorming 'hackathon' sessions to de velop solutions to specific market or regulatory 
challenges. Innovation Hubs are forming a key component in such support to help new 
businesses understand how existing regulation applies to their ideas. Regulatory 
sandboxes are also emerging quickly as a w ay to offer flexibility in how regulation 
applies for business models and ideas that have no precedent. Nevertheless, as these types 
of programmes have only just started, and time will tell if they will be able to be truly 
effective in their aim to ensure adequate consumer protections without stifling innovation.  
The regulator will need to define its role within this new ecosystem to support innovation 
in a way which is aligned with its mandate and will need to work to shift its 
organisational culture and c apacity to align with these objectives. Significant engagement 
will be required to accomplish this, both internally to obtain the support at all levels of the 
organisation, but also externally to stay on top of developments and establish productive 
relatio nships with new businesses. Engagement with counterparts internationally will also 
be necessary to try to ensure a certain level of consistency in the regulations and their 
interpretation and application. Effective engagement will be a key factor in succes sfully 
supporting innovation in financial services, so new ways to engage with all stakeholders 
will need to be established to ensure that the organisation and regulations will be able to 
adapt to a constantly changing environment.

 3. Digitalisation  and the i nsur ance s ector  
There have been a number of technological advances that are impacting the insurance 
sector in diverse ways, and conventional insurers are also actively seeking investment 
opportunities to advance their engagement with thes e innovations too. This article  
examines the various ways in which technology and innovations are impacting the 
insurance sector , and where regulation and legal developments are influencing this. The 
article concludes with some insights into how these developments could affect the future 
of the insurance sector as well as policy issues governments may wish to consider going 
forward . 
  54 │ 3. DIGITALISATION AN D THE INSURANCE SECT OR 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   1. Introduction  
Innovation is a key driver  of the financial sector and has led to immeasurable efficiency  
gains , even though this can initially be accompanied by uncertainty and doubt. In recent 
years, such innovation has happened on the back of new te chnological developments, 
with the phenomenon often being described as “ Fintech ”. As financial services deal in 
intangible products, it is well suited for technological innovation to lower transaction 
costs and expedite  the delivery of services. Although this has, in fact, been happening 
over the history of finance, the recent proliferation of internet connection, home 
computing and mobile devices , and the development of applications ha s led to the 
possibility of lowering ba rriers for market entry and leading to greater competition in or 
“disruption” of the financial industry. However, slating technological and innovation as 
“disruptive” technology can be misleading, and it is likely to be more a hindsight 
observation than th e everyday trial and error that accompanies innovation and 
technological advances.  
The insurance sector is not an exception to this, with developments in technology leading 
to possibilities of new methods of service provision as well as greater opportuniti es for 
data collection that can lead to better risk identification and mitigation measures, which 
are being referred to as “InsurTech”. InsurTech, as compared to Fintech , is more often 
related to service improvements for individuals, as opposed to business es.  
Innovation is generally regarded as a positive development, delivering convenience and 
efficiency. For example, t he advent of cash points (ATMs) assisted people to gain access 
to cash even out of business hours. Improvements in communication networks and 
processing capacity have led to faster payment processes. Insurance claims can be 
processed via online platforms, with less time for processing. Comparative sites permit 
product comparison of various insurance products.  
How the insurance sector respond s to economical and society -wide technological 
innovations, and provides insurance processes and policies that integrate  such changes 
would be an important development to consider. For example, the sharing economy  has 
made startups , such as Uber , making av ailable ridesharing more conveniently and widely. 
While c ommercial motor liability insurance would be a requirement for taxi drivers, Uber 
drivers may not have the appropriate coverage as it is often their side business or a part -
time job. Insurance compan ies are already responding to this specific case, but it presents 
a wider question of how insurance responds to new risks that do not fit the traditional 
lifestyle and/or economic activity of individuals or businesses.  
Given that underwriting is largely based on the analysis of historical data to carry out the 
risk assessment of a policyholder, insurance, on first glance, appears particularly well 
suited for “big data” analysis . Big data and blockchain have been major topic s in many 
insurance discourses  of technology .  
InsurTech has attracted large venture capital investments, and the trend of financing 
indicates th at many startups are considered by investors to be commercially viable on a 
mass -scaled basis. Insurers themselves are making strategic invest ments in insurance 
startups , allowing them  to have a stake in these development s while providing the capital 
for such enterprises to develop their business .   
There have been a number of insurance start -ups such as Friendsurance, Lemonade and 
Policygenius tha t have attracted large investments. To comprehend how disruption may 
be happening in the insurance sector, case studies of startups are presented throughout 3. DIGITALISATION AN D THE INSURANCE SECT OR │ 55 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 this article , to provide context, and better understand how such businesses are being 
developed and  how they are different from traditional business models.  
There are new forms of processes that may be improving the efficiency of intermediation 
and claims management. Most insurance startups involved in distribution have sites with 
well-developed conten ts, often accompanied by the application of artificial intelligence or 
robo-advice. These are intended to give an improved customer experience and lower 
commission/fees for when products are sold, although the initial fixed cost will likely be 
higher. There are some outlooks which predict the number of insurance employees will 
drop as a result of some of these evolutions (McKinsey, 2015).  
This article  examines the various innovations taking place in the insurance sector, and 
what policy and regulatory i mpact they may have, as well as the benefits that could be 
reaped from innovation in the insurance sector, especially for policyholders. There are 
regulatory and competition considerations that need to be made as “disruption” to the 
industry is often about  new market entries as well as new modes of service provision 
which may not fit the mode in which regulations were  conceived upon. There are also 
wider privacy and data protection issues which require close attention given that 
InsurTech by nature usually involves a digital component to the technology.  
2. Funding of InsurTech1 
Funding for new technology and innova tion in the insurance sector is  impacted by the 
wider venture capital (VC) possibilities in the market. In the US, InsurTechs have 
benefited from  a rich and competitive market place for VC funding, and many insurance 
startups have successfully completed a number of funding rounds. Some markets do not 
have a strong VC culture, so the approach to raising capital would be different, with 
public source s becoming more important. For example, the French startup, InsPeer, has 
funding from a number of public sources.  
Funding levels for InsurTech  saw record levels in 2015 , with funding estimated to be 
USD2,669 billion in total. The 2016 Q3 saw funding level s of USD1,401 billion, and the 
number of deals in 2016 Q3 were 126, already exceeding the number of deals in 2015 
(see Figure 1). It should be noted that in 2015, nearly 1/3 of funding went to Zhong An, a 
Chinese internet -only insurer that was established in 2013 with backing from Alibaba 
Group Holding, which raised USD931 million in 2015, and is said to be planning a IPO.  56 │ 3. DIGITALISATION AN D THE INSURANCE SECT OR

https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/2016 -insurance -tech-funding/ . 
 
In 2016 , 59% of InsurTech deals went to US -based startups, followed by Germany ( 6%), 
UK ( 5%), China (5%) and India ( 3%) (CB Insights, 2017a ). This may not perfectly match 
the population of InsurTechs, but is indicative of the VC possibilities in the market, in 
particular for the US, although Asian InsurTech is much weaker compared to the wider 
VC funding in the region. The number of VCs that are investing in InsurTech startups has 
increas ed from 55 funds in 2012, to 141 in 2016 YTD  (CB Insights, 2017b) . 
In addition, insurers are providing funding structures that would allow them to have first 
pick of successful new technology and innovation that could support their existing 
operations and impr ove the customer experience. This has been via both general VC 
funding opportunities and targeted InsurTech investments, as well as establishing 
incubators that host InsurTech entrepreneurs and employees (see Box 1). A number of 
insurers have provided investment to InsurTech startups, as well as Internet of Things 
(IoT) startups.

 Box 1. Funding of InsurTech by (re)insurers  
The wider funding landscape for InsurTech is described above, but a more 
interesting development has been how (re)insurers are fundi ng InsurTech. Some 
of the larger insurers have set up specific funds and VCs to invest in startups, 
including for InsurTech, indicating the likelihood of greater investment into 
InsurTech, and the strategic investments existing insurers will make to ensure  
they have a stake in a startup that may be able to scale their business.  
The number of deals made by (re)insurers in 2016 was 100 deals, compared to 67 
in 2015 and 28 in 2014) (CB Insights, 2017c).

https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/2016 -insurance -cvc-total/  
Reflecting the wider Insu rTech landscape but with certain specific differences, 
US (re)insurers are making the majority of investments in InsurTech with 64% of 
deals being made (as opposed to the actual funding level, for which data is not 
available)(CB Insight, 2017c). Most likel y reflecting investments that Ping An 
Insurance has made in Zhong An, and Taipang Insurance has made in Alibaba 
Health, Chinese (re)insurance investments is 10% of deals made by (re)insurers. It 
may be that given the lower penetration of insurance in China , it is being 
anticipated that the market may develop based on the new intermediation models 
that are being introduced in China. France and UK (re)insurers make respectively 
11% and 6% of deals by (re)insurers (CB Insight, 2017c).  
Many of the deals are ma de by (re)insurers’ strategic VC arm. Ping An Venture 
has been making some of the largest investments in InsurTech with over 20 deals. 
Axa Strategic Ventures has also completed 20 deals and together with Ping An 
have been the most active in deal making of strategic investments. US -based 
insurers MassMutual Venture, USAA, American Family Ventures, Transamerica 
and New York Life follow with between five and ten deals each. After which, the 
European insurers Allianz Ventures, MunichRE/HSB Ventures and Aviva 
Ventures continue.  
58 │ 3. DIGITALISATION AN D THE INSURANCE SECT OR 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   More historically, Axa Strategic Ventures, Transamerica Ventures and American 
Family Ventures have been the most active investors in private tech investing 
since the start of 2012. Axa provided seed funding for five European start -ups 
under a fund set up in France in 2013, before launching Axa Strategic Ventures in 
2015. The €200 million (USD223.47 million) venture capital fund has a mandate 
to invest in innovations in insurance, asset management, financial technology and 
healthcare servic es. Axa created Kamet in 2015, which is a €100 million 
InsurTech incubator working with both internal and external entrepreneurs. Axa 
recently invested €75m to take an 8% stake in e -commerce company Africa 
Internet Group and has become the exclusive insura nce provider through Jumia 
and other platforms.   
3. Insurance intermediation and distribution models  
Insurance intermediation has traditionally used either the agent/broker or bancassurance 
model. While this remains the main intermediation channel for most developed insurance 
markets, many InsurTech startups are proposing new distribution models for insurance. 
These new modes of distribution are in particular interesting for less developed insurance 
markets, where insurance penetration is low and the co nventional intermediation model 
of agent/brokers may not be efficient or effective. Asia and Africa have witnessed large 
investments being made into startups and technology based in their region.  
BIMA  (Box 2) , Friendsurance, InsPeer and Guevara (Box 3) are all distribution -based 
insurance startups, providing new insurance services. While they do not intermediate 
policies in the more traditional sense, they all have brokering licenses to triage the 
appropriate policy using different business models. BIMA ope rates in less developed 
markets, and has had wide success in intermediating health insurance products through 
their model of combining agents with mobile platforms. BIMA has acquired a 
microinsurance license in some of the markets it operates. Friendsuranc e, InsPeer and 
Guevara are all peer -to-peer (p2p) insurance companies that rely on peer pressure for risk 
mitigation.  3. DIGITALISATION AN D THE INSURANCE SECT OR │ 59 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 Box 2. BIMA  
BIMA uses mobile technology to provide insurance services in developing and 
emerging markets, which the technology permits wit h the lower entry costs. In 
many developing countries, in Africa in particular, mobile phones are widely used 
for not only telecommunications, but also for accessing banking and payment 
services. The proliferation of mobile phones (penetration of 70% of po pulation) 
and the acceptance of the technology for financial services have enabled BIMA to 
expand its health services in 16 markets. The success of this model has enabled 
BIMA to reach profitability in several markets already.  
The main innovation of BIMA is the creation of a proprietary back -end tech 
platform which creates a mechanism for both registration and payment. 
Policyholders register using their handset to fill in some basic identification 
details which process takes approximately 2 minutes. Premiu m payment is 
collected via automatic deduction of prepaid airtime credit; unlocking a new 
payment channel that makes insurance affordable and accessible.  
Distribution is carried out by a trained agent force. BIMA agents make the initial 
contact with poten tial policyholders, providing product education about all 
aspects of the policy including basics like the cost (just a few cents a day) and the 
coverage level. Post -sale, the customer will receive a confirmation SMS plus a 
monthly reminder of their coverag e status and amount to be deducted.  
BIMA sells a range of personal insurance products, including accident, life and 
hospitalisation cover (this policy pays a fixed amount per night spent in hospital). 
To claim, policyholders call customer support that wil l help them to file their 
claim which is paid in cash within 72 hours of the claim being completed.  
BIMA is primarily licensed as an insurance intermediary and/or a licensed 
microinsurance provider, where applicable, and not an underwriter. Data is stored  
in Sweden which data protection regulation would apply.  
In total, BIMA has raised USD75 million in capital so far. In 2015, BIMA closed 
its series C funding round with USD38 million raised from existing investors, 
including Investment AB Kinnevik, LeapFr og Investments and Millicom. This 
builds on a successful B series funding of USD22 million and USD15 million of 
capital invested before these rounds.

FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   Box 3. Friendsurance, InsPeer and Guevara  
Friendsurance, InsPeer and Guevara are based on similar business models, although 
operating in different markets (respectively Germany, France and the UK).  
Friendsurance  
Friendsurance was launched in 2010 and has funding from a number of internet 
venture capitalists (Horizons Ventures, VantageFund, e.ventures, the German 
Startups Group as well as the European Regional Development Fund). They are 
licensed as insurance brokers in Germany. Friendsurance is considered a pioneer 
of “social” or “person -to-person ” “peer -to-peer” (p2p) insurance, offering 
household, personal liability and legal expenses and car insurance. Policyholders 
with the same type of insurance form small groups, which could either be with 
friends or find a group on their site. A part of the group’s premiums are paid into 
a cashback pool. If no claims are submitted, the members of the group can get up 
to 40% of their premiums paid from the cashback pool at the end of the year. 
Claims are settled using the cashback pool, and thus the claims dec rease the cash 
back amount at the end of the year. Large claims are covered by normal insurers, 
with whom the firm has partnerships.  
The benefit of p2p insurance is that the network effect discourages the group from 
making claims for very small amounts and  policyholders seek participation from 
friends to increase the size of the pool.  
InsPeer  
InsPeer was launched in 2015 in France, and is a p2p insurance scheme that enables 
a group of people to share their deductible when a claim is paid.  InsPeer is backe d 
by angel investors, Bpifrance, the City of Paris, and Region Ile de France.  
As the higher the deductible, the lower premiums become, a policyholder can 
raise their deductibles and share the risk with the designated group of people. 
InsPeer provides servi ces for auto, motorcycle, and homeowners insurance 
policies. Other than increasing the deductible, InsPeer does not require changes to 
insurance contracts.  
Users form small groups which share the risk that one or all will file a claim. 
Users can participat e in as many insurance groups as they like but their exposure 
is limited to €100 pledged to any one participant and €1,500 across the platform. 
The service is completely free if there are no claims. In the case of a claim, 
InsPeer keeps a 10% of the claim paid by the insurer.  
To assist policyholder assess who to share their risks, a risk indicator has been 
developed that indicates the expected claims rate of one person. This risk 
indicator for consumers is expressed in years, for example 8.5 years means tha t 
there is a chance of paying a claim once every 8.5 years.  
Guevara  
Guevara is a UK based insurer, and offers a choice of groups to join for auto 
insurance policyholders, to which their premium is split into one portion that is 
paid into the individual gr oup (protection pool) and the rest into the single 3. DIGITALISATION AN D THE INSURANCE SECT OR │ 61 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 collective pot (insurance fees) that supports all of the individual groups. The split 
of premium is determined by the number of members in a group.  
Claims are first paid from the protection pool until it is exhausted, after which 
claims are paid from the insurance fees. When the insurance fee is also exhausted 
and the combined ratio exceeds 100%, reinsurance is taken out. Any funds left in 
the protection pool remain in the pool the following year, and requ ires being 
topped up only, in addition to the annual insurance fees.  
By using peer pressure, the objective is to keep claims low. Guevara is authorised 
as a peer -to-peer insurance provider by the FCA, and can operate as a broker.  
The best known carrier model is Lemonade, which has acquired an insurance carrier 
license, and attracted one of the largest seed funds for an InsurTech startup in 2016 
(Box  4). 
Box 4. Lemonade  
Lemonade is one of the InsurTechs to have raised the largest amounts of seed funds, 
with a USD13 million seed round from venture capital Seqouia Capital and Aleph, as 
well as investments from XL Innovate, XL Catlin’s venture capital arm. Lemonade 
Insurance  Company is a property and casualty insurance company based in New 
York and with a New York state license as a full -stack insurance carrier.  
Premiums are paid into a claims pool, and from that a fixed fee (20% of premiums) 
is taken out monthly for reinsur ance coverage and expenses, with the remaining 
being used to pay claims. If the total of premiums paid is more than the fees and 
paid claims, moneys are returned to policyholders in the form of an annual 
'Giveback'. Giveback is donated to charities of the policyholder’s choice, and for 
this purpose virtual groups of 'peers' are formed around the charities of choice. 
Reinsurance is used to pay for claims that exceed the size of the pool.  
Premiums are calculated individually for each policyholder and are bas ed on a 
number of different factors including credit history, recent claims and information 
about the property including its age, size, and construction quality.  
Lemonade has developed an AI app, Maya or Jim, to make the offer of an insurance 
policy. Risk  mitigation factors such as sensitivity of homes to windstorms, severe 
weather damage, and fires are taken into account, and discounts made for protection 
equipment that may have been installed, such as fire and burglar alarms.  
It has hired a renown behav ioural scientist, Dan Ariely, as its Chief Behavioural 
Officer. Lemonade is a benefit corporation and a certified B -Corp, the only in the 
insurance industry, which is certified by the non -profit B Lab and must meet high 
standards of social and environmenta l performance, accountability and 
transparency . A benefit corporation is a for -profit corporation with a mission to 
achieve positive impact on society, workers, the community and the environment 
in addition to profit as its legally defined goals.   
Lemonade ’s reinsurance partners are Everest Re, Hiscox -Lloyd’s of London, XL 
Catlin -Lloyd’s of London and Berkshire Hathaway’s National Indemnity.  62 │ 3. DIGITALISATION AN D THE INSURANCE SECT OR 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   Finally, there is the self -governing model that often uses blockchains to auto execute the 
contract. There are poten tial benefits that could be reaped for risk transfer tools, such as 
cat bonds, which will be another area that blockchains are likely to further explore.  
Blockchain is based on distributed computing, which results in a decentralised network. It 
is by desi gn meant to avoid centralised  control  and is characterised by free participation. 
One of the advantages of blockchains in terms of financial transactions would be the 
improved cyber security due to it decentralised nature. Another is the transparency of 
transactions, which are all recorded in the node of the blockchain. Linked with this is that 
when a smart contract is part of the blockchain, there will be no need to authenticate the 
transaction, as it is effectively announced through its transparency and i t is irreversible , 
which is another feature of the blockchain.  
There are a number of ways in which blockchain technology could be applied to 
insurance services. InsurETH described below presents a case study, but if a blockchain 
can use external, third -party data sources, claims management could be automated 
potentially reducing the transaction cost. Para -metric insurance could benefit from such a 
process, especially for agriculture or disaster -related insurance for retail policyholders. 
Fraud detection co uld also be improved if blockchains were able to access data on 
purchase records, police reports, ownership etc.  
The blockchain by nature does not permit amendments to transactions after the fact. This 
means that while for standard policies the technology could be a useful tool, for complex 
policies it may have limitations in its application. The legality of a blockchain -based 
contract is unclear, and thus its enforceability could be compromised as a result. As the 
policy would be written in the code of the  blockchain, for regulatory and legal purposes 
an administrative step could become necessary for it to be transformed into a legal 
document, until the law recognises a blockchain as a legal document.  
Blockchains do have limitation in the volume of data it can store and process. As it is 
decentralised and consensus -based, scaling a blockchain technology could face 
limitations. As blockchain transactions may be  carried out using the applicable 
cryptocurrency, this would require those involved in a transaction  to hold the respective 
cryptocurrency, which is subject to exchange rate fluctuation, albeit this could be smaller 
than fiat currency.  3. DIGITALISATION AN D THE INSURANCE SECT OR │ 63 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 Box 5. The use of blockchains in insurance  
Blockchains have the potential to change how transactions are processed, and this 
wave is coming to the insurance sector as well. Allianz Risk Transfer and ILS fund 
manager Nephilia Capital are piloting the use of blockchain smart contract technology 
for p rocessing a natural catastrophe swap. The technology would process the 
transaction and settlement between insurers and investors.  
The pilot demonstrates the technology has the possibility to simplify and accelerate 
contract management. Each validated cont ract on the open shared infrastructure 
contains data and self -executable codes inherent to that contract. When a triggering 
event occurs, meeting the agreed conditions, the blockchain smart contract picks up the 
predefined data sources of all participants,  and then automatically activates and 
determines payout to or from contract parties.  
Another similar initiative taking place between insurers and reinsurers is to explore the 
potential of distributed ledger to streamline paper work and reconciliations for  (re-) 
insurance contracts and accelerate information and money flows, while greatly 
improving auditability. The B3i initiative is a cooperation between Aegon, Allianz, 
Munich Re, Swiss Re and Zurich, which will pilot the feasibility of using anonymised 
transaction information and anonymised quantitative data, in order to achieve a proof -
of-concept for inter -group retrocessions by the use of the blockchain technology.  
"Cat bond" payments between insurers and investors can take weeks or even months 
after the  triggering event due to manual processing and authentication through 
intermediaries is not required. As blockchains cannot be altered, their characteristic 
assists in ensuring that ownership cannot be duplicated or forged.  
A study forecasts that for the reinsurance industry, more efficient data processing and 
reductions in claims leakage and fraud through blockchain solutions could remove 15% to 
25% of reinsurance expense ratios which are typically 5% -10% of premiums (PwC, 2016).  
One of the promising exam ple of insurance using blockchain is the startup InsurETH. 
InsureETH uses one of the blockchain platforms, Ethereum. Ethereum is one of the 
most popular blockchain platforms which is public and has a smart contract 
functionality. InsurETH offers automated flight insurance which relies on Ethereum 
smart contracts, and recording premium payment in the Ethereum blockchain. Travel 
insurance policies often cover delay of flights or lost baggage, but policyholders are 
not often aware of this coverage and often on ly make claims for higher expense claims 
such as delays due to a medical emergency or to access medical benefits. This is in 
contrast to the flight delays and lost baggage being a much more frequent incident and 
one which can be tracked using third party d ata sources. InsurETH uses this advantage 
by selling flight insurance, and automatically sources proof for claims using a public 
data feed Oraclise. This automates the process, in that if a flight delay occurs claims 
are paid automatically based on the dat a feed information.  
The simplification of the contracting, which is done by inputting the flight number and 
coverage amount, enables travellers to easily access the coverage. The payment is done 
through the deposit of Ether, although denominated primarily  in pound sterling, which 
is the cryptocurrency of Ethereum. So the traveller would be required to create a Ether 
wallet which is also a simplify process using applications.  64 │ 3. DIGITALISATION AN D THE INSURANCE SECT OR 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   4. The sharing economy and insurance  
The sharing or gig economy is becoming a lar ger part of the economy, as services such as 
ridesharing (Uber, Lyft, BlaBla Car) and homesharing like AirBnB become common and 
popular service platforms. As a commercial service, these services will be required to 
have insurance coverage for certain aspec ts of their business.  
As part of this, there is strong recognition that millennials ,2 which are one of the largest 
age cohorts in the US and are entering their highest consumption period, have a 
preference for having digital solutions available for transa ctions (Goldman Sachs Global 
Investment Research, 2016), and this is also prompting insurers to review how to 
approach distribution and claim management. Millennials have a 10% less positive 
customer experience of insurance transaction than other age cohor ts, which is indicative 
of the dissatisfaction felt by this generation to conventional insurance solutions 
(Capgemini Consulting, 2015).  
One of the key features of millennials and the sharing economy is that complete strangers 
share their personal experie nce/review, car, house, quite freely, while confidence in 
established business processes, such as insurance, is considered less positive. From the 
distribution sites, robo -advice and data analytics discussion below, it could be that 
insurers can expect gre ater willingness by policyholders to provide more personal data 
and prefer computer generated advice. Insurer may have to adjust their business processes 
in accordance with such consumer behaviour and take greater care of privacy.  
While the provision of i nsurance coverage for ridesharing services is improving, the 
nature of the service creates unique challenges to underwriting. Public transport and taxis 
require insurance coverage as commercial service providers which are excluded from 
standard auto insura nce. Commercial coverage is based on the driver having certain 
qualification and experience transporting the public, and the vehicle being maintained to a 
certain standard on a periodic basis. Ridesharing typically uses drivers not authorised to 
drive taxi s and their personal vehicles, although in some cases they are licensed drivers 
providing services in their spare time.3  
Some insurers are addressing the unique nature of ridesharing . For example, Uber has 
coverage by separating the coverage to the core p olicy of when a driver has picked up a 
customer and dropped them off, lower coverage for when the driver is logged on to the 
system and waiting for a pick up and a separate coverage for physical damage to the 
driver’s vehicle while it is being used for the  rideshare services. There is still a potential 
gap of when a commercial coverage is in effect, and when the driver’s personal auto 
insurance will be expected to cover any unplanned incidents.  
Peer-to-peer homesharing, such as AirBnB, would likely require  additional coverage as a 
homeowner policy would not cover liabilities caused by a renter. When renting out a 
home on a single occasion, it is likely that homeowner  or renter’s insurance  will cover 
such an occasion, although it may require notification to the insurer in advance. However, 
for repeated homesharing/renting, an add -on to the policy or commercial insurance may 
be required, in particular to cover liability from guest damage. Monthly coverage is 
becoming available for such additional coverage by a  number of insurers.  
Beginning in January 2015, Airbnb began including no -extra -cost USD1 million “Host 
Protection Insurance” for hosts – and in some cases their landlords – designed to cover 
the liability associated with a peer -to-peer rental. Intentional  acts that aren’t the result of 3. DIGITALISATION AN D THE INSURANCE SECT OR │ 65

 an accident are not covered by the insurance, as well as what the website terms “property 
issues,” such as mold, bedbugs and asbestos.  
5. Robo -advice and artificial intelligence  
While price comparison and distribution sites are becoming wide spread, much effort is 
being made to develop sites that provide financial guidance which is tailored to the 
policyholder’s income and needs with greater automation through algorithms for products 
with investment and/or long -term saving co mponents. This could assist in narrowing the 
protection gap of the lower income population as the cost of such services is lowered.  
In comparison to robo -advice, h uman interaction has benefits in that long -term relations 
can nurture trust and understanding  between a policyholder and financial 
advisor/broker/agent, in particular in times of financial difficulty. Financial advisors may 
be better at persuading policyholders to take certain actions. In addition, robo -advice has 
not been challenged in poor marke t conditions where assets lose value. How robo -advice 
might cope in such situations is unclear.  
However , robo -advice has the ability to develop  a financial plan addressing multiple 
goals, including retirement, protection needs, estate planning and health/l ong-term care 
coverage. Robo -advice has the privacy which some may feel more comfortable with 
given the sensitivity in discussing money matters.  
What would be important for many  policyholders is that the fee would be lower than  the 
fee charge by  financial  advisors. In the investment advisory sector in the US, for example, 
financial advisers generally charge 1% of the assets under management as fees, this is 
opposed to the between 15 to 35 b.p. of assets under management charged by investment 
robo-advisors (Investor Junkie, 2016).4 In comparison, in the UK, for example, 
Santander’s branch -based investment advice fees are 2.5% of assets invested, with a 
minimum investment of £500 and a maximum of £150,000.  
AI is being used in a number of sites such as through  the algorithm used by Lemonade for 
its policy  offering and PolicyGenius ( Box 6). AI has the potential to simplify and tailor 
policy offerings to match the needs and financial situation of the policyholder. This is 
different from robo -advice, where  AI is specifically designed for personal advice , 
primarily on investments.  66 │ 3. DIGITALISATION AN D THE INSURANCE SECT OR 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   Box 6. PolicyGenius  
PolicyGenius was founded 2014 to provide users with price comparison 
information on life insurance, long -term disability insurance, renters insurance 
and pet insurance.  As opposed to most insurance comparison sites, it is not based 
on a lead generator model, which interprets an inquiry as a request for a quote and 
sells the client inquiry to insurance brokers/agents who would then try and sell the 
policy. Also the user e xperience is considered a key factor of the business and 
contents is developed for an improved user experience and provides advice on the 
offers being made. They are not affiliated with any particular insurance company 
and their algorithms work to match th e user with the best policy to fit their needs. 
It is licensed as an independent broker in New York state.  
Life insurance is the company’s most popular product, followed by disability 
insurance. Through its “insurance checkup tool” it analyses and generat es the 
advice that is suited for the user.  
It raised USD750 thousand in seed funding, and has raised USD5 million in a 
series A and $15 million in a series B round of funding. Revolution Ventures led 
the Series B round, with previous investors including K arlin Ventures, Susa 
Ventures, Axa Strategic Ventures, Transamerica Ventures and MassMutual 
Ventures. PolicyGenius reached 800,000 users by the end of 2015 although 
whether the user inquiries led to actual policies is undisclosed.  
However , the algorithms are a blackbox, which in some instances could be leading to 
poor advice. A study indicates that for the majority of age groups, a combination of robo -
advice and personal advice was deemed to be optimal (E*Trade Financial, 2016), which 
has generally been th e way in which most insurer AI would be developing their robo -
advice (Acord & Surely, 2016).  
The underlying algorithm of robo -advice and AI are not transparent in most cases, and 
biases could be built in, both unintentionally and intentionally, leading to inappropriate 
advice. The understanding of how this impacts policyholder behaviour and how 
regulation should address this is unclear but an area that requires greater discussion (see 
Box 11).  
6. Data aggregation and analytics  
Internet, the Internet of Things (IoT), hand held devices, and applications are all 
contributing to the possibilities that technology can have in collecting more data from 
businesses and individuals. Social media as well as devices such as Fitbit and Apple  
watch permit device operators to collect individual activity data as well as health related 
data. While insurance has traditionally relied on quantitative data to make risk 
management decisions, data analytics goes beyond this remit and can be contentious  in 
some occasions. Underwriting and claim management are particularly data rich, and 
insurers use data collected for fraud prevention, marketing, claims management and 
pricing risk.  
For example, personal auto insurance in the past relied on internal data sources such as 
loss histor y. However, auto insurers have started to incorporate behaviour -based credit 3. DIGITALISATION AN D THE INSURANCE SECT OR │ 67 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 scores from credit bureaus into their analysis, based on empirical evidence that people 
who pay their bills on time are also safer drivers. There is an issue of risk awareness, as a 
US Government Accountability Office report in 2005 reported that 53% of respondents to 
a survey in the US did not know this when they could request credit scores to be excluded 
for premium considerations in times of hardship ( GAO, 2005).  
Some insurers are engaging such data by having an arrangement with the data collector or 
purchasing the data from a data aggregator. As insurance depends on making an actuarial 
assessment of the risk, having more relevant data would assist the analysis. The release of 
previously unavailable or inaccessible public -sector data has greatly expanded potential 
sources of third -party data. The US and UK governments and the European Union have 
recently launched “open data” websites to make available ma ssive amounts of 
government statistics, including health, education, worker -safety, and energy data, among 
others.  
One example of such endeavour is the marriage of longevity data, face recognition 
technology with underwriting for the provision of life insu rance. Face recognition 
technology is used to predict factors such as chronological age, gender, smoking habits 
and body mass index ( BMI). Based on this data, and accompanied by an activity sensor, 
such a FitBit or physical activity tracker on a mobile pho ne, your expected life 
expectancy is provided. A term life offer is made based on this, and the term period can 
be selected by the policyholder.  
Telematics and insurance is another avenue in which data analytics is being used to 
monitor the behaviour of po licyholders and mitigate risks in advance as well as 
discounting premiums where applicable. Motor insurance related data has been 
abundantly accumulated in insurance companies as it is one of the largest lines in most 
countries. Telematics insurance is whe n a device is fitted into motor vehicles and used to 
track driving. For example, the Italian Insurance Association estimates that blackboxes 
have been installed in over 2 million cars in Italy, to support the provision of blackbox 
insurance, “telematics ca r insurance” or Usage Based Insurance (UBI), and is one of the 
large markets for telematics car insurance. Blackboxes devices track speed, braking, 
acceleration, cornering and the time of the day a journey is made via satellite technology. 
The data is tran smitted to the insurer by GPS which enables the insurer to estimate the 
likelihood of a claim being made. Such programmes benefit young drivers that do not 
have a track record to influence their premiums, for example. While there is no research 
that clearl y indicates the link between telematics and accident rates (UK Transport 
Research Laboratory, 2015), anecdotal evidence suggests telematics solutions can reduce 
collisions by up to 20%, operating costs by up to 10%, and fuel consumption of between 
8% and 1 1% (Zurich Fleet Intelligence, 2016). It is estimated that the number of 
consumer subscribers to telematics insurance is expected to grow to 142 million globally 
by 2023 (IHS Markit, 2016).  
On a risk management level, there are a number of data analytic so lutions that could 
assist insurers. These include integrated geospatial analytic tools, geo -spatial analysis, 
and data quality management tools and claims/exposure matching.  In particular, claims 
processes could benefit from the use of pictures taken and f iled vie smartphones and 
concierge services to smooth the process.  
If data aggregation is being used for actuarial purposes, it could lead to potential ly too 
high premiums or uninsurabil ity of certain segments of the society or individuals, or 
ethically q uestionable outcomes . If premium are risk -based, granularity of the data could 
have both a positive or negative impact. The negative impact would be when potential 68 │ 3. DIGITALISATION AN D THE INSURANCE SECT OR 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   policyholders are not able to purchase insurance at a reasonable premium level when it is 
a risk-based premium (Keller & Hotte, 2015).  
The Internet of Things (IoT) is when sensors and actuators embedded in physical 
objects —from roadways to pacemakers —are linked through wired and wireless 
networks, often using the same Internet Protocol (IP) that connects the Internet. The 
connection permits large volumes of data to flow to computers for analysis (McKinsey, 
2010). Telematics insurance is the best known example of insurance using the IoT. Other 
examples of IoT devices being used for insurance are se nsors in private homes, farms or 
businesses to alert policyholders about risks such as bad weather conditions and security 
surveillance, or to provide feedback about individual risks. Biometric data such as 
electrocardiogram (EKG ) and arrhythmia detection,  pulse and variability, blood pressure, 
respiration information, blood sugar level, muscle activity, sleep patterns, body 
temperature, blood oxygen levels, skin conductance levels, brain activity, hydration 
levels, posture, eye tracking data, ingestion and  fertility information can also be generated 
and applied in data analysis for insurance purposes.  
Having granular data may have a number of unintended consequences. The most 
immediate would be the privacy of those who provide the data. While the data prote ction 
of data relevant to the contracting of an insurance policy is clear, the treatment of data 
collected additional or outside of this may not be. Tracking of data, whether by a 
blackbox device or an activity sensor, provides much data beyond what the in surer may 
require to determine the behaviour of the policyholder or the premium reductions. 
Insurers would not only have data on the driver’s behaviour, but where they travel to and 
visit, and the frequency of this. While activity sensors permit a better u nderstanding of a 
policyholder’s lifestyle, genetics also account for a large part of a policyholder’s health 
and life expectancy. It would become important that a distinction is drawn by insurers for 
when a poor lifestyle caused ill health, for example, a nd when a person is born with poor 
health which have no way of being addressed by lifestyle choices.  
The ownership of data generated through the IoT, as with many digital devices, is still 
being discussed, and currently general privacy and data protection  regulations would 
apply. The US Federal Trade Commission issued a report in 2013 (FTC, 2015), 
examining some of the issues on the IoT and privacy. The manner in which IoT collects 
data makes it difficult to gain consent every time data is collected, and i s not necessary 
either. However, it is important that a choice can be made by the individual before data is 
collected, although not in instances when the context of collecting data is consistent with 
the transaction the individual is entering with the comp any (FTC, 2012). Where the use of 
data would be inconsistent with the context of the interaction, a clear and conspicuous 
choice should be offered.  
Another issue is how cross -border data transfers should be treated. Data can be ubiquitous 
if structured, a nd can be used to analyse behaviour in other countries. This is discussed in 
detail in the next section.  
7. Policy and regulation: its role in InsurTech  
Insurance regulation and innovation hubs  
While innovations are generally a positive development, there are a number of potential 
policy and regulatory ramifications which can create some uncertainty and certain 
limitations in business developments. In terms of competition policy, the potential to have 
new entrants to the market through the application of in novations and new technologies 3. DIGITALISATION AN D THE INSURANCE SECT OR │ 69 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 could bring greater consumer utility. The rationale for competition law or policy is to 
improve the consumers’ welfare and the efficiency in production and supply, which 
would lead to lower prices and wider choice. The possib ility of new entrants in the form 
of startups and greater choice as a result of innovation and technology could bring a 
number of positive developments to competition in the insurance market.  
When startups want to become an insurer or an insurance agent/br oker, there are 
potentially prohibitive capital and/or fit and proper requirements that must be met to gain 
authorisation to operate. Perhaps for this reason, there are very few InsurTech startups 
that have gained insurance underwriting licenses, and most have broker licenses. While 
for prudential purposes these requirements are an important cornerstone to ensure 
policyholder protection, these could potentially be a barrier to new market entry. There is 
a constant tension in the financial sector regarding  the appropriate balance between 
financial regulation and competition, and this is very much relevant in the context of 
innovative technology.  
To address this, some financial regulators have established platforms relaxing some of the 
regulatory requirements  to enable Fintech  startups experiment with their technology. The 
UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)’s Innovation Hub is one of the first applying the 
“regulatory sandbox” approach  (Box 7) . Singapore’s Monetary Authority of Singapore 
(MAS) has also adopte d the regulatory sandbox approach  (Box 8) . Australia’s Securities 
and Investment Commission (ASIC) has established an Innovation Hub to mitigate risks 
by engaging early with Fintech  innovators and helping new entrants understand the 
regulatory requirements . The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and Canada’s Ontario 
Securities Commission have also launched similar platforms in recent months. These 
platforms are all designed to assist new market entries that would encourage greater 
competition and innovation in th e market, ultimately benefiting consumers.  
Box 7. UK Financial Conduct Authority’s Project Innovate  
The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) launched Project Innovate in 
October 2014 to encourage innovation that would benefit customers, and promote 
compe tition through disruptive innovation. Project Innovate is led by the 
Innovation Hub which assists innovative business gain access to fast, frank 
feedback on the regulatory implications of their solutions, and identifies areas 
where the regulatory framework  needs to adapt to enable further innovation in the 
interests of consumers.  
Support through the Innovation Hub is based on an eligibility criteria that includes 
whether it is a genuine innovation, what would be the consumer benefit, has the 
business invest ed appropriately to understand the relevant regulations, and does 
the business have a genuine need for support from the Innovation Hub. The 
Innovation Hub has had over 600 requests for support and offered direct support 
to over 300 firms.  
The FCA has also developed a Regulatory Sandbox. The objective of the 
regulatory sandbox is to create safe spaces in which businesses, both authorised 
and unauthorised, small and large, can experiment with innovative products, 
services, business models and delivery mechani sms without immediately 
incurring the normal regulatory consequences of engaging in the activity in 
question. Unauthorised firms are subject to a tailored authorisation process and 70 │ 3. DIGITALISATION AN D THE INSURANCE SECT OR 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   must meet threshold requirements, but it grants them restricted authorisati on to 
test their ideas. The restricted authorisation option is not available for a banking 
license. For authorised firms, the sandbox could provide clarity to applicable rules 
that do not easily fit into existing guidelines. Consumer benefits would be a 
prerequisite for applications to the sandbox.  
The FCA has stated that it has accepted four applications from the insurance 
sector to develop towards testing.  
 
Box 8. Monetary Authority of Singapore's approach  
The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has adopted the regulatory 
“sandbox” approach to Fintech , which is applicable to the Singapore financial 
sector. The approach that MAS has taken is to acknowledge that new technologies 
can increase efficiency, mana ge risks better, create new opportunities and 
improve people’s lives.  
A regulatory sandbox approach is being proposed to carve out a safe and 
conducive space for Financial Institutions and Fintech  players to experiment with 
Fintech  solutions, while contai ning any consequences of failure. However, 
Financial Institutions are free to launch new solutions without MAS’ guidance if 
they are satisfied with their own due diligence and there is no breach of legal and 
regulatory requirements.  
MAS carried out a publ ic consultation in June/July 2016 and issued the finalised 
Fintech  Regulatory Sandbox Guidelines in November 2016. The below 
summarises some of the key points of MAS’ regulatory sandbox approach.  
The regulatory sandbox approach would involve MAS’ support b y relaxing 
specific legal and regulatory requirements prescribed by MAS for the duration of 
the sandbox. It would generally not be available to Fintech  solutions that are:  
 Similar to those already being offered in Singapore unless the applicant 
can show th at either a different technology is being applied or the same 
technology is being applied differently, and  
 When the applicant has not demonstrated that it has done its due 
diligence, including testing the proposed financial service in a laboratory 
environ ment and knowing the legal and regulatory requirements for 
deploying the proposed financial service.  
There should also be an intention that the Fintech  solution would eventually be 
deployed in Singapore after exiting from the sandbox.  
MAS has identified requirements that should continue to be applied even to sandbox 
applicants, and those that could be relaxed. Requirements that will not be relaxed are 
related to customer information confidentiality, fit and proper criteria particularly on 
honesty and integrity, handling of customer’s moneys and assets by intermediaries, 
and prevention of money laundering and countering terrorism financing.

 The regulatory sandbox approa ch intentionally creates a space for insurance technology 
to be experimented in a different regulatory regime from the regular. Although it is early 
stages of the approaches, it would be worthwhile to understand when technologies are 
deemed successful and scalable, how they will be graduated into the regular regulatory 
framework. Going forward, this will be important in ensuring that a level playing field is 
applied at the appropriate stage.  
A relevant development that is taking place between MAS, FCA and t he Australian 
Securities and Investment Commission are bilateral cooperation agreements between the 
authorities that allow them to make referrals on innovati ve businesses seeking to enter 
each other’s market. This would assist in enabling startups transfer  their business models 
on a cross -border basis, assisting with the businesses to scale when the opportunity arises.  
Another relevant consideration, for developing countries in particular, is whether there is 
merit in having a specific regulatory framework  to allow new insurance products that 
target specific limited risks , that are low in value and may benefit from greater 
penetration of insurance policies while having a limited policyholder impact.5 To date, a 
number of countries (Brazil, India, Mexico, Pa kistan, Peru, the Philippines, South Africa, 
and Taiwan and other African countries) have specific microinsurance regulation (Biener, 
Eling & Schmit, 2013). Microinsurance can also be beneficial in OECD countries, as the 
example of the startup Trov demonst rates. Trov is on -demand insurance for your 
possessions, which can be switched on and off through a mobile device. The mobile app 
enables the value of the inventory of possessions to be tracked in real time and insurance 
premiums as well. With the lower tr ansaction costs that mobile technology can bring, 
microinsurance may find a way to be more readily provided in developed insurance 
markets as well.  
In the age of new technology, insurance regulations which will likely be affected are 
governance and market  conduct related rules. The OECD Guidelines on Insurer 
Governance recommends that board members and key executives should establish 
internal controls that ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulation and standards, as 
well as an incentive structure t hat promotes the fair conduct towards consumers and 
policyholders. Controls functions are expected to assess the appropriateness of policies, 
processes and procedures, and identify and follow up on any deficiencies.  
If an insurer does adopt new technologi es or innovates processes/products, it should 
consider whether the appropriate internal control considerations have been made, as well 
as being appropriate in terms of market conduct.  
A number of countries are engaged in a wider discourse on, for example, autonomous 
cars, which will have on impact on auto insurance coverage. The recent fatality resulting 
from a self -driving car in the US (see Box 9 ) has brought to the attention the reality of 
autonomous cars and how to ensure their safety. Together with thi s, how the liability of 
such a car in an accident has yet to be fully resolved. The UK and US have carried out 
consultations that touch upon this issue, and how this proceeds will likely impact how 
other markets respond as well.  72 │ 3. DIGITALISATION AN D THE INSURANCE SECT OR 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   Box 9 Autonomous cars and insurance  
The advent of mass autonomous or driverless cars is expected to be not in the far future, 
and a number of countries (US, UK, France, Switzerland and Singapore) have started to 
permit the use of certain roads for driverless cars. In the US, severa l states have enacted 
laws on the use of autonomous cars. Driverless cars do have the potential to improve 
road safety by preventing human error, and efficient traffic flows and fuel usage. As 
trials take place, the appropriate framework for insurance cove rage for such for vehicles 
will also become an important aspect for governments to consider.  
The UK carried out a consultation on product liability insurance that would be required 
for autonomous driving or driverless cars in July 2016. The expectation is  for driverless 
cars that can be parked by remote control within the line of sight of the driver, and/or 
cars that can be auto -piloted with human oversight at high speed will be available for 
sale in the coming few years.  
The US Department of Transportatio n and National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration have issued a paper that proposes updates to its Federal Automated 
Vehicles Policy in September 2016. In the US, states have responsibility for mote vehicle 
insurance and liability regimes. As part of th is, states are asked to consider how liability 
should be allocated among highly automated vehicle (HAV) owners, operators, 
passengers, manufacturers, and others when a crash occurs.  
Insurance coverage of a motor vehicle is for damages and third -party liabi lity (TPL). The 
difficulty for driverless cars is with who the liability is placed with: the driver or car 
manufacturer. The manufacturer would be involved through product failure (liability) that 
resulted in a collision while the driver would be liable wh en s/he did not take control of the 
vehicle in certain circumstances resulting in a collision. There is much uncertainty as to how 
the liability of a collision would be addressed when there is a mixture of human input and 
autonomy involved in driving.  
In May 2016, a Tesla self -driving car was involved in a collision when driving on 
autopilot mode on the motor way which was fatal to the driver. TPL insurance would 
not cover the driver unless supplemental insurance was acquired. Some motor 
manufacturers are offering self -insurance to their automated vehicles.  
The UK government inquires on whether there is a need for supplemental insurance 
coverage such as product liability, and drivers and passengers. The industry has responded 
that insurers could provide cov er for all liabilities, and then take over possible liability 
claims to the manufacturer for any potential product liability.  
The Bank of England recently published projections that with the development and uptake 
of autonomous cars, the UK motor insuranc e market may contract by 21% by 2040.c

 AI and the regulation of  technology -based advice  
As AI and robo -advice become more widely used, there could be uncertainty as to how 
current regulation applies. For example, in New Zealand, current regulation requires that 
advice be provided by a ‘natural person’. Planned changes  in New Zealand seek to 
broaden the definition of advice in order to accommodate technological innovations, and 
require that entities providing robo -advice be licensed and held to the same requirements 
as other types of advisors (New Zealand Ministry of Bu siness, Innovation and 
Employment, 2016). Fully automated services are not allowed to provide advice in 
Canada, and any robo -advice service must provide some access to personalised advice 
from an advisor (Lortie, 2016).  
Regulators in several jurisdictions have been assessing how technology -based advice 
should be regulated going forward. The Australian Securities & Investment Commission 
(ASIC) issued a regulatory guide on robo -advice to retail clients in August 2016 (ASIC, 
2016). The guide maintains that the  qualification requirements for providers of robo -
advice be the same as those for normal advisors, and lays out the requirements for testing 
the algorithms used and the governance controls and processes in place.  
In April 2016, the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a rule proposed 
by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) that require s developers of 
algorithmic trading to be registered as a securities trader, and be subject to the same 
qualification requirements as securities tr aders to reduce market manipulation (SEC, 
2016). The European Supervisory Authorities (European Banking Authority, European 
Securities and Markets Authority and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions 
Authority) have issued a joint discussion paper on  the automation of financial advice 
looking at the potential benefits and risks of such innovations in order to determine any 
additional regulatory action needed to address automated financial advice (Joint 
Committee of the European Supervisory Authorities , 2015).  
The regulations and consultations taking place indicate the need for consistency with the 
regulation of human financial advice and proper risk and governance controls of the robo -
advice being provided. The type of advice being provided by the plat form should clearly 
indicate whether the advice being generated is general or has been personalised. If the 
advice is determined to be personalised advice, clear processes would need to be in place 
with respect to how suitability for the client is determin ed. The algorithms used for 
automation should be extensively tested, and controls in place to ensure that procedures 
are in place to ensure their proper functioning.  
There is also the issue of whether algorithms may have biases that, whether intentional o r 
unintentional, may be leading to inappropriate advice. This could impact policyholders on 
a wider base than advisors, as the bias would be built in and anyone who uses the 
algorithm will be subject to it. Another issue that has been highlighted is that r obo-advice 
and risk management algorithms could lead to herding, increasing pro -cyclicality 
(Carney, 2017).  
Privacy and data protection issues  
Technology that engages big data is complex, opaque and often uninterpretable. For this 
reason, even those who de velop the technology for usage of big data may not fully 
comprehend the impact or appropriate usage of data. Firms should be able to demonstrate 
that their use of data is appropriate and free of biases in so far as possible.  74 │ 3. DIGITALISATION AN D THE INSURANCE SECT OR 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   Privacy and data protection re gulations for big data and data analytics by insurers, should 
be rigorously addressed, and ethically uncertain use of data should be fully assessed. In 
this respect, the wider data protection regime will have a large impact on how this is 
addressed. In add ition, when notification requirements for data breaches are introduced, 
insurers will need to ensure that databases have the capacity to support this requirement. 
However , notification requirements are also likely to assist the development of standalone 
cyber insurance markets.  
Under the current EU regime, for example, cross -border data transfers are not permitted 
unless made to an Adequate Jurisdiction or the data exporter has implemented a lawful 
data transfer mechanism (according to EU Data Protection Di rective (95/46/EC) and the 
EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)(Box 10). To be deemed an Adequate 
Jurisdiction, the GDPR will be extending the requirements from the Directive for the 
jurisdiction to have inter alia  fundamental rule of law and legal  protection of human 
rights, access to transferred data by public authorities, and effective and functioning data 
protection agencies (DPAs), international commitments and other obligations in relation 
to the protection of personal data. For transfer of da ta within the corporate group, GDPR 
requires corporate to have Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) that are legally binding and 
apply to and be enforced by every member of the group of undertakings envisaged in 
joint economic activity, and have DPA approval of the BCR.  
 
Box 10. EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  
The EU Parliament and the European Council agreed on the General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR) in December 2015. It would be applicable to firms 
that process personal data from those resid ing in the EU irrespective of whether 
their services are free or fee -based, whether the firm is based in the EU or not. It 
is an update to the Data Protection Directive which came into force in 1995. 
Under the GDPR, fines can be up to €20 million or 4% of global annual turnover, 
whichever is the higher, if the action of the firm leads to a loss of information or a 
data breach. It will take effect in member states from 25 May 2018.  
GDPR requires private information to be erased without undue delay when the 
data is no longer required in relation to the purpose for which it was collected. 
The data used must also restrict use of data when the data quality has been 
contested by the data subject. The firm must maintain an accurate record of the 
data subject’s agre ement for their data to be used for primary and any secondary 
purposes, without which the firm may not have the right or ability to use the data.  
Depending on how and where insurers process their data, this could have 
implications on how new technologies c ould be introduced. In addition, the 
market of cyber risk insurance could expand depending on how GDPR is 
implemented. It could also impact data analytics which may have relied on data 
collected for different purposes.

FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 In the EU, outsourcing arrangements and distribution agreements must be agreed with 
caution, in terms of who is controlling and processing data. Under the current EU 
directive data protection regime, the processing of personal data cannot take place unless 
there are legitimate g rounds to do so, which under GDPR will require insurers (data 
controllers) to carry out a “data protection impact assessment” before processing personal 
data. Insurers are expected to implement sufficient consents and effective protocols for 
collecting, ha ndling and processing all data an insurer controls.   
Further, under the GDPR, data controllers will be required to notify personal data 
breaches to the competent supervisory authority, where feasible, no later than 72 hours 
after becoming aware of the brea ch, unless the data controller is able to demonstrate that 
the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects 
concerned. Notifications must also be made to data subjects “without undue delay” if the 
breach is likely to result in a high risk to their rights and freedoms. Businesses could be 
fined up to €20 million or 4% of annual global turnover in the most recent financial year, 
whichever is greater, for failure to comply with GDPR.  
RegTech  
RegTech is an emerging are a in Fintech , that uses technologies to solve regulatory and 
compliance requirements more effectively and efficiently (IIF, 2016). Given the various 
regulatory reforms introduced after the financial crisis, RegTech has the potential to 
ensure more effectiv e compliance of complex regulations. T echnologies that are deemed 
to be applicable for RegTech include machine learning and artificial intelligence, 
biometrics, the interpretation of unstructured data such as e -mails and Facebook posts, 
and the use of appl ication programming interfaces (APIs). Box 11 discusses RegTech and 
algorithms. Those tools can be brought to bear on such areas as aggregating big data, 
mode lling risk for stress -testing, monitoring of capital -requirement compliance, updating 
compliance m anuals, improving anti -money laundering and know -your-customer (KYC) 
programs and preventing fraud and in -house violations.  
RegTech is an area where countries which have developed regulatory approaches to 
Fintech  have benefited more from startups, with 31%  of RegTech startups incorporating 
in the UK, as opposed to 20% in the US (Mulder, 2016).  
For insurance, for example, there are data analytics platforms that allow internal data of 
financial institutions to be converted into regulatory reporting formats, a nd this could be 
applied to the insurance sector. There are a number of know -your-customer ( KYC ) 
platforms which may use external, open data to verify customer identity. As solvency 
modernisation initiatives require asset managers of insurers to be able to  report 
investments on a look -through basis, RegTech solutions could provide a platform for 
insurers to grasp their asset -under -management in a simple interface.  76 │ 3. DIGITALISATION AN D THE INSURANCE SECT OR 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   Box 11. RegTech and algorithms  
While a number of solutions are being proposed for insurance in  the area of 
RegTech, in particular for fraud prevention and solvency compliance, an 
emerging area is how insurance companies can ensure that their algorithms are 
compliant with market conduct regulations. Some startups are working to address 
unintended co nsequences of algorithms, to ensure that financial institutions, 
including insurance companies, can integrate algorithms in their customer 
interface as well as enterprise risk management in a manner that corresponds to 
the objective of efficiency and effec tive of business processes while minimising 
potential risks of algorithms.  
ORCAA is a NY -based technology startup founded by a data scientist to carry out 
audits of algorithms. The model being used is examined from four phases: data 
collection and integrit y, objective of algorithm, the basis in which the algorithm 
has been built, and monitoring and updating of the algorithm. Algorithms have 
been known to use certain proxies, such as post code, which could result in certain 
segments of the population being u nfairly treated depending on how the algorithm 
is modelled.   
An area that financial regulation has been relatively exposed to algorithms is in 
high-frequency trading, where trading algorithms are used to execute high 
volume, high speed automated trading i n financial markets. Financial regulators 
such as the Federal Reserve Board (2009) and the French Autorité des Marché 
Financiers (2009) had issued reports on this issue; nevertheless, a mutual fund 
trade resulted in a mass withdrawal by high frequency trad ing and the subsequent 
crash of the Dow Jones (“Flash Crash”) in May 2010. Germany adopted the High -
Frequency Trading Act in 2013, which requires high frequency trading firms, not 
previously supervised by BaFin, to be supervised by BaFin. Firms are require d to 
ensure that markets are not distorted or interrupted. The algorithm -tagging rule 
mandates that exchanges have to implement rules requiring all exchange members 
to flag all algorithmically generated orders with a unique key when sent to a 
German exchan ge so as to allow the market surveillance system to allocate all 
orders to the generating algorithm (Coombs, 2016). The EU Commission has 
issued a technical standard to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 
(MiFID) II, which will be implemented in  2018, on how to implement articles 
relevant to high frequency trading in April 2016.  
Monitoring of algorithms is complex, requiring special skills and expertise, and 
regulators and supervisors are often not equipped to understand or assess 
algorithms and /or whether big data is being appropriately used. In the insurance 
sector, the known uses of algorithms are primarily related to the customer 
interface, although solvency initiatives are likely pushing insurers to use 
algorithms for the measurement of solv ency as well.  
Regulators should consider how to approach the use of algorithms and big data by 
insurers that would ensure that they are being appropriately developed and are 
avoiding, in so far as possible, biases and unintended consequences. In particula r, 
stress testing might be carried out to determine how robo -advice would cope in 
certain extreme market conditions.  3. DIGITALISATION AN D THE INSURANCE SECT OR │ 77

 8. Conclusions  
It appears that InsurTech businesses are developing business models that may, in fact, 
better address the insurability of policyholders by using technology to simplify the 
contracting process, and tailoring policies to better suit their needs. There is als o scope 
for insurance to adapt to wider changes in economic activity, such as the sharing 
economy and the large millennial cohort. Another  characteristic of many InsurTechs are 
the social and environmental considerations that their business models incorporate. Many 
of the InsurTechs try to improve the transparency of the contracting as well as the claims 
management process , including fraud d etection , providing greater clarity to where the 
premiums paid go, which could have an impact on the wider insurance industry.  
There also seems to be a wider recognition that the fine print of an insurance quotation is 
tedious to read, without giving much  insight into the actual coverage of the policy for 
retail clients. Sites are being developed that simplify the information on coverage of a 
policy and try to clarify the level of premiums, while introducing peer pressure for risk 
mitigation. There is ofte n an algorithm to carry out the risk assessment using a few 
questions which may also use external data sources to assist the assessment.  
The scale of InsurTech investment is growing, and by (re)insurers in particular. As 
InsurTechs start to attract a larg e number of users/policyholders, and provide an improved 
customer experience, (re)insurers will likely hope to capitalise on the success of such 
startups by having a stake in them. A number of (re)insurers have created strategic 
venture capital arms for th is purpose, and have been making strategic investments in a 
number of  startups.  
Some countries are establishing regulatory platform s, such as the regulatory sandbox 
approach,  that allow innovative technologies to enter the market, and this will assist in 
encouraging startups to develop their business model while becoming acclimatised with 
regulatory requirements. Startups may opt to initiate their business in markets which have 
such a ready platform.  
More broadly, these technologies have the potential to bring better and more customised 
insurance coverage to more people, including those in the lower income bracket , and 
bring greater financial protection. In addition, the new distribution models can simplify 
the insurance process, and bring insurance to les s developed markets.  
However, InsurTech will have to meet insurance regulations as well as wider data protection 
and cyber security requirements as they try to scale their business. Ensuring that not only is 
the customer experience positive when it is scal ed up, but that consumer protection and safety 
standards are met will remain a challenge for startups and regulators alike.  
The development of innovation hubs and regulatory sandbox approaches provides an 
environment for new technologies and innovations t o be nurtured, and has the potential to 
enable a greater understanding of their impact on the markets. However, greater clarity on 
the appropriate level of regulation in such platforms and how they graduate into full 
regulation requires further discussion in order to balance the need for innovation as well 
as the need for adequate protection of policyholders.  
The impact of the use of big data and algorithms and how regulators could approach their 
evaluation is unclear. The complexity involved has implicati ons for how regulators organise 
themselves as well as for how the spirit of regulation is applied. Firms should be expected 
to demonstrate that their use of data is appropriate and free of bias in so far as possible. 
RegTech may have a role to play in assi sting that this is carried out going forward.  78 │ 3. DIGITALISATION AN D THE INSURANCE SECT OR

 4. Robo -advice  
The accessibility of appropriate and suitable financial advice has become a topical issue 
alongside the increasing prevalence of defined contribution pensions for which 
individuals need to manage their own investments. Riding the wave of technological 
innovati on in finance, the robo -advice model has emerged as one potential solution to 
increase the accessibility and affordability of getting help to invest savings for retirement. 
These models are challenging traditional distribution channels, and are rapidly gai ning 
market share in terms of assets under management. This article provides an overview of 
the types of robo -advisors that are now available and discusses the potential benefits, 
risks and challenges of such platforms.

FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   1.  Introduction  
This article discusse s the robo -advice platforms that are rapidly emerging as an 
alternative to traditional financial advice and that are increasingly available for investing 
pension assets. These platforms automate much of the investment process, suggesting 
particular investm ents based on information provided by the consumer.  
The emergence of robo -advice platforms has been driven by a combination of regulatory, 
market and technological trends. Regulation of financial advisors has been moving 
towards increased transparency for consumers with respect to what they are paying for 
financial advice and the potential conflicts of interest that their advisor may face. This has 
been achieved through the requirement of simplified and comprehensive disclosure 
requirements as well as limit s on opaque remuneration structures that present conflicts of 
interest  (OECD, 2016 [6]).  
These developments have had an impact on both the supply and demand for financial 
advice for retirement, particularly for low to moderate  wealth consumers. On one hand, 
the limits on opaque remuneration structures can result in an increase in the use of more 
transparent structures such as fees based on a percentage of assets under management, 
which reduces the profitability of lower wealth clients and thereby the incentives for the 
advisors to serve these clients. On the other hand, the increased transparency has made 
consumers more aware of the cost of advice, and many are simply not willing or able to 
pay the high fees. This has directly i mpacted the advice gap, reducing the availability and 
the perceived affordability of financial advice.  
These trends have created an opportunity for low -cost technology -driven business models 
offering investment advice services to enter the market. Robo -advisors, a term coined to 
refer to digital platforms which offer automated portfolio management services, have 
multiplied exponentially in recent years, with assets under management expected to reach 
USD 1 trillion by 2020  (BI Intelligence, 2017 [7]). Their business models rely heavily on 
automation and algorithms, allowing them to offer services at significantly lower costs 
compared to traditional investment services due to gains in efficiency. Many of the early 
movers in this mar ket were independent. Established players in the investment advice 
market are also beginning to offer their own proprietary robo -advice services as a lower 
cost alternative to their traditional advice channels in order to be able to compete in this 
market.  
While all robo -advisors generally emphasise their lower cost services and transparent fee 
structures, they can differ widely in their individual value propositions.  The majority 
target individual retail investors, though an increasing number are also off ering services 
for institutional investors such as pension funds or even to financial advisors themselves 
as a means to increase the efficiency of their services. Robo -advisors also differ in terms 
of their investment approach and advice services offered. The low -cost feature of robo -
advice has been its main draw, but these types of platforms also offer additional benefits 
for consumers such as increased accessibility and objectivity. Nevertheless, this 
innovation is not without risks. Regulators will need to ensure that the appropriate 
framework is in place to ensure adequate consumer protection for the users of these 
platforms and to mitigate the potential investment and other risks that these platforms 
present.  4. ROBO -ADVICE │ 83

 The key findings of this article are:  
1. Robo -advice platforms have the potential to increase accessibility of investing to 
a broader market and to do so relatively more cheaply than through the traditional 
channels.  
2. Robo -advice platforms have the potential to deliver financial advice that is 
objectiv e, consistent and transparent.  
3. However, the increased level of automation may require different approaches to 
ensure that the users have a sufficient level of understanding of the investments 
they are making.  
4. Policy makers will need to ensure that existin g legislation applies to robo -
advisors with respect to the applicability of duty of care requirements, avoidance 
of conflicts of interest, transparency of disclosure and access to redress in the 
case of an unfair outcome for the consumer.  
5. Regulators and su pervisors will need to have processes in place to ensure that the 
algorithms that these platforms use are accurate and robust.  
The structure of the article is as follows:  
Section 1.   presents the introduction and key findings.  
Section 2.   describes the m ain features of robo -advice platforms.  
Section 3.   highlights the benefits that these platforms can present to consumers.  
Section 4.  discusses potential risks that these platforms could present.  
Section 5.  addresses additional challenges that policy makers may face with the 
increasing prevalence of robo -advisors.  
Section 6.  concludes.  
2.  The value proposition of robo -advisors  
The main value proposition of robo -advisors for retail clients is to make investing more 
affordable and accessible by relying on user-friendly digital platforms, algorithms and 
primarily low -cost passive investments. Those targeting mass retail consumers and 
younger generations often have low initial investment requirements to encourage new 
investors to begin investing. There are al so a few robo -advisors that target more affluent 
investors and therefore require a higher minimum investment, and often also include 
some level of access to a human advisor.  
Robo -advisors are also increasingly offering their services to institutional inve stors, 
particularly for pension providers. These platforms can allow pension providers to reduce 
the costs for their members and more easily manage their investment risk profile.  
Still other robo -advisors target financial advisors as a way to improve the a dvice services 
they offer to their clients and remain competitive given the increasing prevalence of retail 
robo-advisors. These services propose to reduce the time the advisors spend on 
monitoring the portfolio and meeting regulatory requirements, and to improve the 
investment interface for their clients.  
While robo -advisors all tend to offer a lower -cost alternative to existing investment 
advice solutions, they differ in their approach to providing investment recommendations 84 │ 4. ROBO -ADVICE  
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   and portfolio management. These differences can relate to the types of investment 
accounts offered, the funds which are available to invest in, the algorithm to generate the 
recommended investment, the additional services offered and finally how they are 
compensated for their services.  
Type of account  
Robo -advisors can allow their retail clients to open various types of accounts on their 
platforms. The standard type of account is a simple brokerage account which allows the 
client to invest in the securitie s market. However, tax -sheltered accounts, such as those 
used for retirement savings, can also be offered subject to meeting the relevant regulatory 
requirements. In the United Kingdom, for example, many robo -advisors offer Individual 
Savings Accounts (ISA s) for which the capital gains are not taxable, and some also offer 
investment for personal pensions. In France, life insurance, which offers reduced taxation 
on capital gains, is commonly offered by robo -advisors. In the United States, robo -
advisors offer  Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) which either defer tax to retirement 
or allow capital gains to be tax -free at retirement. For the moment, the focus of most of 
these services for pensions is on the accumulation phase, as automated services for the 
decumulation phase are much more complex.  
Robo -advisors also offer services for institutions sponsoring pension plans. Betterment, 
for example, offers a service directly targeting employer -sponsored 401(k) retirement 
savings plans in the United States, and D ecimal offers a wrapper for superannuation 
funds in Australia.  
Investment products offered  
Most robo -advisors focus on offering low -cost passive investment. The most common of 
these are Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), favoured for their low cost, high liquid ity and 
high diversification potential. ETFs behave like index funds, in that they are designed to 
track a basket of underlying assets. They are regularly traded on exchanges, and can be 
purchased in small amounts making them convenient for individual inve stors.  
Robo -advisors typically use a set of criteria to select the ETFs they make available on 
their platform based on the desired profile of investment options. These criteria can 
include cost, liquidity, tracking performance, spread, sector, risk level a nd volume, 
among others.  
While many robo -advisors offer ETFs exclusively, some robo -advisors also offer other 
options, such as direct investment in indices. Other robo -advisors may not subscribe fully 
to a passive investment strategy, and may offer activel y managed options such as mutual 
funds.  
The provider of the product may also be a consideration in product offer when the robo -
advisor is not fully independent. Some robo -advisors have partnered with specific product 
providers, and others act as proprietar y distribution channels of large asset managers 
whose products would be favoured for selection.  
Investment recommendation  
The type of recommendation provided by robo -advisors varies in the extent to which it is 
tailored to the situation of a specific indi vidual.  At the very least, the recommendation 
will take into consideration the investment goal and the time horizon of the investment in 
order to define the risk level of the recommended portfolio. If the goal is retirement 4. ROBO -ADVICE │ 85 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 savings for someone under the a ge of 40, for example, the initial recommendation would 
include a higher proportion of equities given the long time horizon. A more thorough 
assessment of an individual’s risk tolerance is also often performed before making a 
recommendation. This assessmen t usually takes the form of a questionnaire and many 
rely on insights from behavioural economics to more accurately assess the individual’s 
willingness and ability to take investment risk.  
While most robo -advisors currently only take into consideration the  individual’s goals for 
the specific investment in question, some platforms offer recommendations based on a 
more comprehensive view of the individual’s particular financial situation. For example, 
such recommendations may also take into consideration othe r assets and investments, 
spousal income and tax implications.  
Based on these inputs, algorithms will generate a recommended asset allocation based on 
commonly accepted financial theories such as mean -variance optimisation, which aims to 
maximise return fo r a given level of risk. While the individual usually does not have 
much of a choice in which specific funds are invested in, they may still be able to adjust 
the risk level of their portfolio, for example by increasing the proportion of equities. 
Algorith ms can then automatically continue optimising the portfolio on a regular basis. 
While this process can be fully automated, some robo -advisors include a certain level of 
manual management of assets by investment managers which can take into account 
dynamic considerations such as current events. Robo -advisors targeting non -retail clients 
may offer more flexibility in how the portfolio is determined. Decimal, for example, 
allows the institutional client to select the algorithm applied.  
Hybrid robo -advisors of fer the possibility of consulting with a human advisor in addition 
to automated services, though usually in a limited manner. For example, this component 
could be reserved for those with sufficiently high balances, or the length or frequency of 
the consult ations could be limited. These consultations are usually offered via telephone 
or internet, but Yellowadvice is an example of a platform which also provides this service 
through physical branches if the client prefers to discuss in person.  
Platforms which are the most automated naturally tend to offer lower fees, while those 
offering higher levels of human involvement and/or interaction also charge more for their 
services. Jurisdictions vary with respect to the type of business model which is most 
prevalent . Platforms in the United States, for example, tend to offer higher levels of 
automation, while those in continental Europe tend to maintain relatively high levels of 
human interaction with their clients.  
While the types of robo -advisors discussed here pro vide an explicit recommended 
investment strategy, the term ‘robo -advisor’ is also commonly applied to a wider range of 
digital trading platforms which may not provide an investment recommendation. Box 1 
provides a brief overview of other types of automated  trading platforms which also aim to 
increase the accessibility and affordability of investing through user -friendly platforms 
which have low and transparent fees, but which do not make a specific recommendation.  86 │ 4. ROBO -ADVICE  
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   Box 1. Other 'robo' trading platforms  
Online platforms which facilitate investing in securities at a low cost are 
increasing in prevalence along with robo -advisors. While these platforms are 
more self -directed and do not provide specific investment recommendations, they 
can incorporate a certa in level of automation (e.g. rebalancing or tax optimisation) 
and a variety of pre -packaged investment strategies that individuals can choose 
from.  
One type of platform offers the opportunity for individuals to invest in pre -
defined strategies which can be  purchased as -is or can be adjusted by changing 
the exposure of each of the underlying securities. Folio, for example, offers 
target -date funds which reduce investment risk as the target date approaches, and 
offers conservative, moderate and aggressive ris k options. Other portfolio options 
offered include those based on investment strategy, geography, or sector. Motif 
offers a similar platform, including professionally built portfolios based on certain 
income strategies, values, even global opportunities, a mong others.  
Online investment platforms have also facilitated the phenomenon of social 
trading, where investors can copy the strategies of others or be copied themselves 
and be compensated. Motif, for example, allows individuals to also construct their 
own portfolios in which other people can then invest.  eToro offers an algorithm 
that automatically copies the investments of selected traders.  
Other services offered  
Beyond the initial portfolio recommendation, robo -advisors can offer numerous 
additional automated services for their clients. The most common are automatic 
rebalancing of investment to maintain the desired level of risk and automatic 
reinvestment of dividends. Tax efficient investment is also commonly offered for taxable 
accounts, namely usin g tax -loss harvesting algorithms which sell securities generating 
losses to offset capital gains for tax reporting purposes. This can improve total net returns 
for the investor.  
The robo -advisor may also provide suggestions for the investor that are not au tomatically 
executed. These could be suggestions to buy or sell, or simply a suggestion to stay put 
during a period of market turmoil, providing some of the hand -holding that human 
advisors claim to provide to prevent their clients from panic selling follo wing a market 
downturn. Indeed such communications can be quite effective; advize reports that 90% of 
clients follow its recommendations within 15 days  (Finance Innovation and Cappuis 
Holder & Co., 2016 [8]). Some services also suggest actions to meet specific goals on an 
ongoing basis, for example additional deposits or suggestions on how much income to 
withdraw from a pension. Active Asset Allocation, for example, provides proposals for 
pension funds on how to best reach their funding objectives or optimise drawdown.  
Several platforms offer self -directed tools that the individual can use to help them plan 
for their financial goals, particularly for retirement. Such tools can recommend how much 
an individual needs to save to main tain their desired standard of living, taking into 
account factors such as spousal income, desired location and tax implications. Others can 
help individuals decide how to draw down their pension savings. Evalue, for example, 4. ROBO -ADVICE │ 87 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 has created a pensions freedom  planner in light of the removal of the requirement to 
purchase an annuity in the United Kingdom, helping individuals to decide what to do with 
their assets at retirement. Some platforms also promote financial education, such as 
Yellowadvice, which provide s easy -to-read articles on financial news and incorporates 
gamification on its website to improve investment knowledge. WealthKernel stresses the 
importance of educating clients, as if they understand the risk they face, they will stay 
invested longer and ultimately be more profitable clients in the long term.  
Services can also be provided to facilitate the fulfilment of regulatory requirements for 
institutional investors or financial advisors. For example, suitability reports can be 
automatically generate d in compliance with regulatory requirements. Regulatory alerts 
can also be provided to help advisors stay up -to-date with any changes.   
Pricing structures  
As one of the main benefits of robo -advisors is their ability to offer investment services at 
a lower cost, they tend to be upfront and transparent about the fees that will be charged to 
consumers. Generally, the platform charges a management fee as a percentage of assets 
under management. The level of this fee varies widely from one platform to the next, 
however, and also depends on the additional services offered. The high end of the range 
charges around 1%, but often management charges are significantly lower than this. The 
management cost can also be defined in terms of a flat fee, but this is les s common 
particularly for investments above a certain minimum threshold.  
On top of this management fee are the expense fees of the underlying funds which are 
invested in. For robo -advisors which concentrate on offering ETFs these fees are 
generally quite l ow, coming in at under 0.2 -0.3% on average. Fees for other investment 
offerings, however, may be higher.  
The services that robo -advisors offer to their clients are usually included in the 
management fee. However some business models offering ultra -low mana gement fees 
may generate their revenues from charging for complementary services. WiseBanyan, for 
example, charges 0.25% for tax -loss harvesting which intends to increase total net returns 
on investment by reducing the taxes owed.  
Despite the increased tra nsparency in costs, the potential for conflicts of interest remains. 
Proprietary platforms face the conflicts of offering their own funds for investment. Some 
services also accept retrocessions and rebates from third parties. Therefore although the 
cost th at the consumer pays upfront may be transparent, there may still be hidden costs 
with respect to the criteria used for the selection of investments available on the platform.  
3.  The benefits of robo -advice  
The increased prevalence of robo -advisors has the pot ential to greatly increase both the 
affordability and accessibility of financial advice, particularly for mass affluent clients. 
The use of digital platforms and algorithms can reduce costs and improve efficiency, 
while user -friendly interfaces can facilit ate investing and make the process more 
transparent and accessible. The use of algorithms can also increase the objectivity of 
financial advice, overcoming the challenge of human and emotional bias in traditional 
channels. Furthermore, algorithms make the logic and rationale of the financial advice 
transparent, facilitating the audit and supervision of such platforms.  88 │ 4. ROBO -ADVICE  
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   Increased affordability and accessibility  
First, robo -advisors can reduce the cost of financial advice in terms of direct fees paid by 
the cl ient. Robo -advisors can automate many of the time -consuming activities of financial 
advisors such as the monitoring and rebalancing of the portfolio, reducing the need for 
costly human intervention. Indeed, algorithms can perform some portfolio management 
tasks such as rebalancing and tax -loss harvesting much more efficiently and effectively 
than a human advisor. Furthermore, the reliance on passive instruments reduces the cost 
of investment compared to actively managed funds.  
Given the online nature of the se platforms, robo -advisors can also reduce the search costs 
and the time individuals spend to make their investment decision and monitor their 
investments. The time it takes to make a recommendation can also be significantly 
reduced. For the fully automat ed platforms, clients may spend only around 15 minutes 
filling out the questionnaire about their goals and risk tolerance. Once invested, 
consumers have the ability to access their account and see their investments on demand 
whenever is convenient for them . 
These platforms have the potential to have a significant positive impact on financial 
inclusion. The user interfaces of robo -advisor platforms are typically designed to be user -
friendly, making them easy to use and understand. This increases their access ibility to a 
much wider audience, even those with lower levels of financial literacy. Clients are 
prompted with questions and proposed recommendations in simple and concise language, 
and these platforms often make linking to other accounts straightforward.  
Furthermore, digital platforms offer flexibility of access that investors could not 
previously have. People can access their portfolios when it is most convenient for them, 
such as in the evenings or on weekends. They can take the time to look up terms or  
concepts that they do not understand without embarrassment or feeling pressured.  
The benefits of the affordability and accessibility of robo -advice furthermore have the 
potential to increase the proportion of individuals investing, particularly in stock m arkets, 
which could help to address the problem of the inadequacy of pension savings by 
allocating more savings to investments with higher expected returns. One study with a 
German bank showed that sending customers an invitation to use their robo -advice 
service significantly increased client participation in the stock market  (Scheurle, 2016 [9]). 
As an invitation to receive personal advice did not have the same observed effects, the 
author attributed this participation to the re duced perception of the cost of participating, 
both in terms of time and potential advisor fees.  
Increased objectivity, consistency and transparency  
The use of algorithms allows investment recommendations to be based on financial 
techniques and theory free  from the behavioural bias of an advisor, resulting in objective 
recommendations for the client. This is a key benefit of robo -advice, as advisor bias can 
significantly influence the investment recommendations they make to their clients, though 
some bias m ay still remain in the selection of the algorithm itself. Conflicts of interest, 
particularly those relating to the compensation received from advisors’ recommendations, 
has been shown to result in recommendations that are not in the client’s best interest  and 
that result in inferior investment performance.  
The use of algorithms will also result in consistent recommendations. The standardised 
profiling of clients to assess their goals and risk tolerance will be free from subjective or 
emotional judgements of the financial advisor, resulting in consistent recommendations 4. ROBO -ADVICE │ 89 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 for clients with a given profile. Critics of this type of profiling cite the lack of ability to 
check the accuracy of the responses or the ability to follow up if responses are not 
consisten t. However, such profiling techniques can also include consistency checks, and 
should define how any inconsistencies are treated, and some platforms such as Easyvest 
still follow up with the client with a human advisor to address any anomalies.  
Finally th e use of algorithms increases the transparency of the process followed and logic 
used to make the recommendation. Unlike advice from a human, the reasons why a 
specific recommendation is made are unambiguous, as the recommendation simply 
follows the logic underlying the algorithm. This facilitates supervision to ensure that the 
advice is compliant with regulation and that the necessary due diligence was performed 
and duty of care standards respected.  
4.  The challenges and risk s of robo -advice  
The potential ben efits of robo -advice in helping individuals reach their retirement savings 
goals are clear, but policy makers must also be aware of the potential risks from these 
platforms and make sure measures are in place to mitigate these risks. Regulators need to 
ensure that existing regulation for financial advice is appropriately applied to robo -
advisors, particularly with respect to how the recommendations made by these platforms 
fit within the definitions of financial advice, how potential conflicts of interest sh ould be 
addressed and how the robustness and appropriateness of algorithms is assessed. Ensuring 
that consumers continue to pay attention to their investment is also likely to be a 
challenge, as an automated process where no large decisions are required by  the 
consumer may result in consumer disengagement from the investment process even when 
financial circumstances may change. Finally, mechanisms need to be in place to protect 
consumer’s assets and mitigate potential systemic risk from these platforms.  
Definition and suitability of financial advice  
A key challenge for the regulation of robo -advice platforms is determining to what extent 
they actually provide financial advice and how the existing regulation of financial advice, 
particularly relating to duty of care standards, should apply. Regulation often stipulates 
that a recommendation is considered advice only when it is personalised, i.e. is tailored to 
an individual’s specific circumstances, rather than a general recommendation 
(OECD,  2016). Which perso nal details need to be taken into account for advice to be 
considered personalised therefore need to be clearly defined. It needs to be determined, 
for example, whether a recommendation based on a goal of retirement in 20 years’ time is 
simply a general re commendation or one which is personalised.  
Where regulation determines that the recommended advice is personalised and/or in 
scope of the regulation, it must also clarify the scope of the advice. Regulation often 
distinguishes between simplified advice, wh ich is provided for a matter of limited scope, 
and comprehensive advice which considers the entire financial situation of the individual 
(OECD, 2016 [6]). Many robo -advisors provide recommendations which relate only to the 
specific account and investment goal. However several robo -advisors are now also taking 
other assets or spousal income into account. The definition between the two types of 
advice will need to be clear in order to determine the level of due diligence required,  as 
established by the existing regulation. Policy makers will also need to consider whether 
the existing regulation is sufficient for these platforms and business models.  90 │ 4. ROBO -ADVICE  
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   Ultimately, whether or not the client perceives the investment recommendation as bei ng 
personalised for them should determine the applicability of regulation. Numerous 
platforms have tried to avoid regulatory requirements by including a disclaimer that the 
recommendation they provide is a general recommendation and should not be interpret ed 
as personalised. Regulators will need to ensure that suitability requirements still apply to 
the recommendation provided if it is likely that the client would feel that it has been 
tailored according to their characteristics.  
The effectiveness of the questions asked to determine the suitability of a recommendation 
for an individual should also be considered. Robo -advisors vary with respect to the 
number and types of questions asked to determine an individual's needs and risk profile. 
Among the platform s participating in the roundtable, the number of questions used to 
profile clients ranged between five and 22. Yomoni, which was at the high end of this 
range, asks not only how much money individuals are willing to lose in a market 
downturn but also how m uch they have ever lost in order to determine a client's risk 
tolerance. All participants recognised the importance of getting the profiling right and 
providing a suitable recommendation to their client, however. If clients are invested in 
line with their risk tolerance and needs, they will be more likely to stay invested for 
longer and less likely to panic sell in a market downturn. Therefore regulators and 
supervisors should emphasise this point and ensure that the interests of the provider and 
the consum ers remain aligned.  
Conflicts of interest  
While the use of algorithms can remove human bias in the recommended portfolio, there 
may still be bias with respect to the funds chosen to be available on the platform, as this 
choice in particular could potential ly be influenced by conflicts of interest. Platforms that 
are not independent may have incentives to recommend their own products and funds 
more frequently, which could result in higher costs for the consumer. There are also robo -
advisors that accept retro cessions and other payments from third parties relating to the 
funds or their trading. As such, even if the consumers are not paying these fees directly, 
there may be hidden costs in terms of the fund options which are available to them and 
the process fol lowed to execute the trade. These costs and conflicts are not always made 
clear to the consumer.  
Regulators therefore need to ensure that the relevant regulation requiring the avoidance, 
mitigation or disclosure of conflicts of interest is applied to robo -advisors and consider 
whether adaptation of the current regulation is necessary to ensure that issues specific to 
robo-advisors are in scope. Avoidance and mitigation of conflicts of interest could be 
enforced, for example, through a required conflicts of interest policy, which is already 
mandatory in several jurisdictions for entities providing financial advice. Applied to robo -
advisors, such policies could require details of transparent and objective processes and 
criteria used to select funds, and define  the frequency that funds are reviewed to ensure 
that they continue to fulfil the criteria. Regulators also need to ensure that full disclosure 
requirements are being met, particularly with respect to how these services are being 
compensated and earning re venue.  
Robo -advisors should not be held to lower standards than their equivalent human 
counterparts. For example, the robo -advisor quirion is registered in Germany as a fee -
remunerated investment advisor, and must therefore pass all commissions and kickbac ks 
received to their clients, in line with regulatory requirements for all investment advisors 4. ROBO -ADVICE │ 91 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 registered as independent. By contrast, Vamoo (also operating in Germany) did not 
register, as it claims that it is simply a placement agency and not an advisor.  
Robustness and transparency of algorithms  
Given the high reliance on algorithms for providing investment recommendations and 
managing portfolios, it is vital that these algorithms are accurate and robust. Procedures 
need to be in place to ensure proper ov ersight of the development of the algorithms, 
thorough auditing, and testing for resilience in extreme scenarios as well as mechanisms 
to allow consumer access to redress in the event that the algorithms fail.  
The individuals developing the algorithms mus t have a sufficient understanding of the 
financial theory underlying the algorithm and its output. Some jurisdictions are 
considering aligning the qualification standards of those who develop the algorithms with 
those of financial advisors to help ensure t hat this is the case. The process to set and 
update assumptions used for inputs into the model also needs to be clearly laid out to 
make sure that the models can adapt to changing financial environments, and checks need 
to be in place to ensure that the un derlying model continues to be relevant.  
Existing regulation for financial advice, however, may not address the need for auditing 
and stress testing of financial advice provided. Regulators will need to make sure that 
these aspects are addressed to ensure that the algorithms are robust and will not cause 
problems for consumers or the financial markets particularly in extreme scenarios, such 
as the flash crash of 2010, where markets fell dramatically before rapidly rebounding. 
Even in normal markets, however , coding errors could result in large -scale systematic 
mis-selling to consumers.  
In addition, robo -advisors should be required to be affiliated with the relevant dispute 
resolution scheme in the jurisdiction to ensure consumer access to redress as a result  of 
any flaws in the algorithm or investment process.  
Consumer disengagement  
Another risk in automating the investment process is that consumers may not take the 
time to understand how it works or to consider the assets underlying the investment, 
though th e reduced need to do so is arguably one of the benefits of robo -advice. Reduced 
engagement is even more probable where mass market consumers are targeted, who have 
lower levels of wealth and are also likely to have lower levels of financial knowledge. 
Further, given the automated nature of robo -advice, individuals may simply disengage 
from monitoring their investment, which could lead, for example, to not updating their 
information and needs following a change in circumstances.  
One potential way to address this concern is to require that the algorithms and 
investments are appropriate for their targeted consumers. For example, high risk 
investments such as leveraged instruments are not likely to be appropriate for consumers 
with lower levels of wealth and fin ancial knowledge, and should not be included in 
automated platforms targeting the mass market. Such requirements to ensure that 
products are appropriate for the market that they target are already included in the 
insurance regulation in several jurisdictio ns to ensure that the products being developed 
are likely to be suitable for the consumers who purchase them.  
Regular communication with consumers could also aid in maintaining a certain level of 
engagement. For example, emails or texts could be sent to co nsumers to inform them of 92 │ 4. ROBO -ADVICE  
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   their progress towards their financial goals and/or to remind them to update their 
information if their situation has changed.  
Required disclosures should also be presented in a simple and comprehensible manner so 
that consumers w ill read and understand them. Simplified and standardised disclosures 
are already becoming a mainstream requirement in many jurisdictions for financial 
advice.  
Consumer engagement is not only an issue for retail clients. Regulators will need to 
ensure tha t businesses using robo -advice services to manage the investments that they 
offer to their own clients understand how these platforms operate and make their 
assessment of suitable recommendations. Since these businesses are the contact point for 
their cons umers, they will need to be held responsible for inappropriate investment 
recommendations and should not be allowed to fully pass this responsibility to the third 
party provider.  
Sustainability of business models  
While the use of algorithms and automated p rocesses allows robo -advisors to charge 
lower management fees than traditional channels, some critics are concerned that the fees 
which are charged in practice may be too low to sustain their business models. Reasons 
for this include high cost of customer acquisition, low average account balances and short 
average holding periods  (SCM Direct, 2016 [10]).  
Client acquisition seems to be a major challenge for these types of platforms. Many rely 
at least partially on referrals by ex isting clients to expand their consumer base. There is 
also some evidence that the market is becoming overcrowded, contributing to the lower -
than-expected levels of consumers investing with a given platform  (BI Intelligence, 
2017 [7]). Scaling up for platforms that have started by targeting a niche market may prove 
to be challenging.  
Given these potential concerns and the fact that many of these platforms are start -ups for 
which the business model has not been tried and tested ov er the long run, regulators need 
to ensure that mechanisms are in place to protect the assets that consumers invest with 
these platforms in the event that these platforms fail. Robo -advisors should be required to 
be affiliated with any relevant securities insurance fund that other brokers or asset 
managers are required to join.   
Systemic risk and pro -cyclicality  
A final concern is the potential for robo -advisors to lead to pro -cyclicality in the market 
and affect the stability of the financial system. This  could be a concern where the 
algorithms used by robo -advisors recommend very similar investment strategies leading 
to herd behaviour, and where the robo -advice market achieves a significant volume to 
move markets with its trading activity.  
This concern is  partially mitigated by the fact that differences do exist in the assumptions 
behind the inputs into the algorithms used to generate the recommended investment 
portfolio for clients. This is true even where the investment propositions are very similar, 
for example focusing on the offer of low -cost ETFs through mean -variance optimisation. 
First, robo -advisors use different criteria to select the funds available on their platform. 
Second, the granularity of asset classes across which the portfolio is diversif ied can differ, 
which impacts the overall balance of the recommended portfolio across funds. Third, 
even where an equivalent financial theory is employed, the derivation of the underlying 4. ROBO -ADVICE │ 93 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 assumptions (e.g. mean return and variance) can differ based on the methodology used. 
Finally, the optimised portfolio will differ depending on the individual’s inputs regarding 
their investment objectives, risk tolerance, and other personal characteristics.  
With respect to pro -cyclical selling in market downturns, these t ypes of platforms do not 
seem to necessarily present more risk than traditional advisory channels. Participants who 
had experience in both anecdotally noted that they even observed more pro -cyclicality 
with traditional channels. However, mechanisms do need  to be in place to prevent pro -
cyclical investing, namely through an accurate assessment of risk tolerance and effective 
communications to reassure clients in volatile markets.  
The volume of trading activity by robo -advisors relative to the markets they tr ade in 
should be monitored by supervisors. The size and liquidity of a fund can be criteria in its 
selection in order to prevent regular trading activity of the robo -advisor from having an 
influence on the price. For the moment, the volume of assets invest ed by robo -advisors 
does not pose a concern, but these volumes are expected to grow rapidly and should be 
followed closely to prevent increased pro -cyclicality and market volatility.  
5.  Additional challenges for policy makers  
The digitalisation of the financial advice market is not new, and actually began over a 
decade ago as advisors started using digital and automated models to inform their own 
advice to their clients. Regulators and supervisors have therefore had a gradual 
introduction to the types o f issues that robo -advice presents in its current form. 
Nevertheless, existing regulation may not always be adapted and ensuring its continued 
relevance remains a key challenge for policy makers going forward.  
In many cases, new legislation may not be requ ired, but regulators will need to assess 
how existing rules apply and help new businesses to understand the regulatory 
requirements that they must abide by. New businesses may not understand, for example, 
whether they are required to be licensed and which regulations will apply to them. Some 
roundtable participants noted, however, that many businesses want to be licensed and 
regulated, as this lends more credibility to their business and may help them gain 
consumer trust and confidence.  
 Existing legislatio n should also be examined to assess any regulatory barriers that exist 
for the robo -advice market to successfully develop in a way that is most beneficial for 
consumers. Regulatory requirements should not be an undue burden for small players to 
enter the m arket, and regulation should apply proportionality in its application, taking 
into account the size of the business and risks that it may present. Inconsistent regulatory 
requirements across sectors may also hinder the development of some types of models. In 
Europe, for example, banks and insurance companies are not held to the same disclosure 
standards. Cross -border regulations will also need to be addressed to take advantage of 
the portability that digital investment platforms can offer and to facilitate the international 
expansion of the platforms. Fragmented regulations, and in particular different tax 
regimes, present large challenges for cross -border transactions to become the norm.  
Regulators and supervisors may also need to undergo a cultural shift i n how they operate 
and enforce their rules. Going from supervising humans to auditing algorithms, for 
example, will require a different mind -set and skill -set. Compliance with regulatory 
processes will also need to be adapted to a digital world. For exampl e, Know Your 
Customer requirements and contract signing will need to be able to be fulfilled digitally 
to maximise the benefits of increased accessibility that robo -advice platforms can offer.  94 │ 4. ROBO -ADVICE  
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   Regulators will also need to be mindful of the challenges of li kely future developments in 
the provision of robo -advice. While many of the platforms existing today focus on 
pension accumulation, pension decumulation will become an increasingly important 
issue. Regulators will need to consider the scope of products tha t these platforms are 
required to offer. Purchasing an annuity, for example, could be a better solution in some 
cases than gradually drawing down invested assets in retirement.  
Another looming challenge is the development of platforms using artificial inte lligence to 
provide investment recommendations. Such developments would make the underlying 
algorithms less transparent to supervisors and more difficult to determine the basis of the 
recommendation and whether or not it was suitable for the client. Policy  makers should 
be forward -looking in how they approach regulation of the robo -advice market in order to 
be able to address these types of issues more easily when they arise.  
6.  Key t akeaways  
Robo -advice platforms vary widely with respect to the level of autom ation and the value 
for money that they offer to their clients. One thing that virtually all have in common, 
however, is an aim to increase accessibility of investing to a broader market and to do so 
relatively more cheaply than the traditional existing ch annels.  
These new channels present many of the same regulatory challenges as traditional 
financial advice from human advisors. Policy makers will need to ensure that existing 
legislation applies with respect to the applicability of duty of care requirement s, 
avoidance of conflicts of interest, transparency of disclosure and access to redress in the 
case of an unfair outcome for the consumer.  
Robo -advice platforms also present new challenges which will need to be addressed. 
Regulators and supervisors will ne ed to have processes in place to ensure that the 
algorithms that these platforms use are accurate and robust. The increased level of 
automation may require different approaches to ensure that the users have a sufficient 
level of understanding of the invest ments they are making.  
With risks appropriately managed, however, robo -advice platforms have the potential to 
greatly increase the accessibility of investing in the capital markets for pension savers, 
thereby helping individuals to accumulate more retirem ent savings.

 5. Competition and open application programm ing interface  
standards in banking  
Given the erosion in the public’s trust in market mechanisms and globalisation as a 
means for delivering inclusive prosperity for all, the creation of effective markets is a 
priority for policy makers. This article looks at the creation of open application 
programming interface (API) standards in banking, and explores the competition 
problems that they address. It argues that by fundamentally changing the way that 
consumers buy and use banking services this represents the development of a more 
entrepreneurial approach to remedying malfunctioning markets. It also underlines the 
importance of competit ion authorities being able to investigate market failures on the 
demand side (and to take action to resolve those failures), and notes that these remedies 
may have consequences for other markets where consumers lack property rights over the 
data that is co llected on their behaviour.

FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   1.  Intro duction   
The role that the state plays in innovation has become a matter of great debate since the 
financial crisis. While some continue to argue for the state to stand back, get out the way, 
and let firms innovate, othe rs such as Mazzucato (2013) and Rodrik (2012) argue with 
force and some success that crowding out effects are sometimes illusory, and that the 
state can play a key role in generating innovations for the economy (citing its success in 
developing the interne t, GPS, AI, and pharmaceutical compounds) and should continue to 
do more to form its own vision as well as simply plugging the gaps where private sector 
investment is lacking, as Keynes suggested.1 At the same time as this debate has 
unfolded, competition authorities have increasingly seen their role as protecting 
competition not simply to keep prices down, but also to drive innovation and quality. 
Concerns over the impact that a lack of competition has on innovation have therefore 
increasingly come to the fore (e.g. in the European Commission’s recent Dow/Dupont 
merger decision).2  
A longer -term trend has been for competition authorities to look to remedy a lack of 
competition through remedies that operate on the demand side. This has led to market 
studies that recommend or require measures to help empower consumers to drive 
competition and make markets work better (rather than divestments or conditions that 
apply to the firm’s behaviour). These include the provision of better information that 
helps consumer s compare products and measures to make switching easier. At the 
intersection of these trends is the case of open application programming interfaces (APIs) 
in banking.  
A competition investigation in the UK by the Competition and Markets Authority 
provided  the grounds for pushing through requirements that the largest UK banks enable 
consumers not just to share their data with third parties, as required by the European 
Union’s second payment services directive (PSD2), but to do so using open access and 
commo n standards for data, security and APIs (which enable software applications to 
share data and functionality). The remedy was expressly designed to create a new class of 
innovative business models in which third parties would help consumers to drive 
competi tion by providing tools to manage their money and their banking services so as to 
obtain better value. The remedy recognises that consumers have been unable on their own 
to drive the market to offer this better value by switching, or considering switching,  and 
that efforts to help them do so by providing better information or reducing switching 
costs have proved inadequate.  
As an intervention it articulates a middle way by which the state, can develop and 
exercise entrepreneurial vision and pro -actively in tervene in markets to stimulate and 
incentivise innovation in particular areas. Moreover this can be consistent with the 
established principles of competitive neutrality which sit less comfortably alongside some 
of the direct interventions proposed under t he auspices of new and so -called modern 
industrial policy that are becoming increasingly popular across the OECD. Such remedies 
will therefore be of interest to those considering interventions in other markets in which 
consumers are found to be reluctant t o switch, either due to a lack of confidence in their 
ability to compare products (e.g. energy), or as a result of strong network effects (e.g. 
social networks).  5. COMPETITION AND OPEN APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE STANDARDS IN BANKING  │ 99

 2.  What is API?  
Whereas a User Interface (UI) allows a human being to use a software application, an 
API allows one piece of software to use another application’s data or functionality. For 
example, the API on Google Maps gives third party developers the building blocks that 
make it simple to embed Google Maps on their own webpages (see Ub er or CityMapper 
for example). In a similar fashion, access to consumers’ bank data through APIs (where 
they give consent) would make it easy for third party developers to program applications 
that help consumers to better understand and manage their finan ces.3  
A key difference in what is to follow is between open and closed APIs, and standardised 
and non -standardised APIs. An open API can provide a third party access to public ly 
available data (such as a bank’s product offerings) and secure shared access to private 
data (such as a user’s transaction history).  This access can be provided to either a broad or 
a narrow group of third parties that meet certain criteria, hence where a broader list is 
used the API is more open than those where a highly restricte d list is used.   
A standardised API may increase competition by allowing entry, promoting innovation 
and reducing costs. In contrast a non -standardised API might be useful if a bank wanted 
to make it easier for third party developers to create applications for the banks own 
customers. However, in order for these developers to make applications that work across 
banks, and hence allow both comparability and management of multiple accounts with 
different banks, they are likely to need a standardise d API to be agreed amongst the 
banks. If not, a different building block would be required for each different bank, and 
these would need to be updated if a bank subsequently altered its API. This could be 
expected to radically increase the third parties co sts and therefore prevent entry and 
innovation in this space, particularly from smaller app developers. By requiring 
agreement on a standard set of APIs that are available to wide list of third parties, these 
costs can be kept low and entry and innovation can be stimulated amongst a broad range 
of entrepreneurial firms.  
What type of applications might third parties develop?  
There are a number of different types of application that might be developed by third 
parties. These might require APIs for account in formation, or payment initiation, or both.4 
For example:  
 Applications that compare bank  accounts, open new accounts, and automatically 
switch money between accounts in order to maximise the consumer’s returns.  
 Applications that help consumers analyse and understand how they use their 
money, and prompt them to change the way they manage their money in order to 
achieve their goals.  
 Applications that make payments straight out of the consumer’s bank account 
(without going via a credit card) such as Amazon’s one-click payment option.  
 Applications that draw together information on offers available (including 
cashback) when the consumer makes a purchase.  
 Applications that help banks to offer better value personalised savings or loans 
services to consumers (by providing access to the data required to personalise an 
offer which traditionally only your existing bank has and hence has little 
incentive to use).  100 │ 5. COMPETITION AND OPEN APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE STANDARDS IN BANKING  
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018    Applications that include a ffordability check s that speed up loan processes by 
giving lenders access to a user’s data.  
 Applications that connect o nline accounting  software with their  bank accounts.  
 Applications that offer f raud detection across multiple accounts.  
 
Box 1. Three Example s of Open API driven Banking  Applications  
Safteynet Credit.  This app makes a  secure connection to the user’s bank account 
during the application process, and uses this to track the users balance and to 
deposit money into the account to prevent the user incurring unauthorised 
overdraft charges, and then takes repayment when there a re sufficient funds in the 
account. Similar applications optimise the interest users receive (rather than 
minimising fees incurred) by automatically moving money into higher interest 
paying accounts.   
Yolt.  This app provides a single view by which users c an monitor their current 
accounts, savings accounts, and credit cards. It analyses user spending, provides 
insight to users on their spending patterns, and allows users to manage their utility 
bills and subscriptions. It also offers a comparison service.  
Credit Kudos . This app takes the data from the user’s bank account and uses it to 
provide a measure creditworthiness that is based on their most recent data. This 
has the important benefit of enabling those with thin credit records (those that 
have not borr owed and hence have not demonstrated creditworthiness by repaying 
a loan).  
Where banks are not required to make their standardised APIs openly available t hese 
applications are likely to operate as multi -sided platforms that might earn revenue from 
consumers, from banks or from advertisers. Competition agencies would therefore need 
to consider the difference that these other sides make to their analysis. For example, when 
considering market definition, measuring market power or efficiencies, or investigating 
exclusionary conduct or vertical agreements. In particular, a key lesson from the OECD’s 
recent work on rethinking the use of traditional antitrust enforcement tools in mu lti-sided 
markets is the need to assess the importance of cross -platform network effects. These 
quantify the extent to which additional participation or use by one side increases the value 
of the platform to users on other sides of the platform.       
Whil e these applications are currently generally being launched by start -ups it is not 
difficult to imagine that larger established tech platforms might acquire or launch their 
own services as banks’ API data becomes available. Banks are naturally also likely to 
react to this innovation by competing to provide services that analyse consumers 
spending and help them to manage their money.5  
3.  What competition problems arise?  
Banking consumers have, across many jurisdictions, been found to exhibit the same 
inertia t hat is evident across a number of other markets (e.g. pensions, energy). The 
explanation for this may of course be different in different markets. However, a fairly 5. COMPETITION AND OPEN APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE STANDARDS IN BANKING  │ 101 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 typical set of findings are those of the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority, whose 
mark et investigation found that:  
1. “Current accounts for both personal and business customers have complicated 
charging structures, and t he actual cost to the customer depends on how they use 
the account. Customers generally know very little about the charges an d service 
quality provided by other banks. It is therefore hard for customers to know 
whether they could get better value and service from another bank or a different 
product with the same bank.  
2. Personal and business current account relationships are open -ended and do not 
have regular trigger points (like the annual renewal of insurance policies, for 
example) when customers might be prompted to ask themselves whether they 
could be getting a better deal elsewhere on their current account rollover  
3. There is n ow a reliable and efficient Current Account Switch Service (CASS). 
This makes it easy for customers to switch current account from one bank to 
another, but the service is not widely known, and does not command as much 
confidence as it deserves.  
4. Charging st ructures for overdrafts are particularly complicated, making it even 
harder to compare providers. Customers worry that if they switch they might not 
get the same overdraft from their new bank. Moreover, we found that many 
customers underestimate their overdraft use.”6 
The inactive and inert nature of the consumption of banking services therefore emerges as 
the key malfunctioning of the market mechanism. The extent of this inertia can be 
significant – in the UK, the average consumer stays with their bank for  nearly 20 years, 
making them more likely to divorce than switch bank. This means there is very little 
opportunity for rivals to challenge or for comparison websites to earn revenue .  
Perhaps the most important driver of inertia is the first finding that t he costs of the 
selected service can vary significantly depending on how the consumer manages the 
account. If the consumer cannot accurately anticipate their behaviour and hence the costs 
they incur then this suggests that the textbook model of a market in  which rivals can offer 
an alternative product at a better price (or quality) and hope to persuade consumers to 
switch to them, may not apply. In these markets the consumer only finds out the price (or 
quality) of the product after consuming and experienci ng the product. This is because the 
price paid depends on the consumers’ behaviour after selecting the product. In isolation, 
this is a fairly common problem that is often resolved. For example, manufacturers of 
products that break down obtain bad reputati ons and reviews from consumers, and 
consumers learn not to make the same mistake twice, firms therefore learn that there is 
only a short -term gain to producing poor value products when better alternatives exist.  
However, if a consumer is unaware of their own usage pattern then they are unable to 
understand whether the product they have purchased was a good or a bad deal, relative to 
the other products that they might have purchased, and hence whether they might have 
done better or not. This makes the produ ct a ‘credence good’. In markets for credence 
goods, the consumer learns nothing from their own experience, and is likely to repeat any 
mistake they make when choosing again.7 In this context, rival firms have little incentive 
to offer better value product s, since these are unlikely to be recognised as providing better 
value, and hence are unlikely to make additional sales. As a result, the incumbent firm 
has a clear incentive to deteriorate the value of its own product and to exploit its 
consumers.    102 │ 5. COMPETITION AND OPEN APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE STANDARDS IN BANKING  
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   The findings allude to other past and possible solutions to inertia which have failed or 
been considered unnecessary or ineffective. For instance, the changes to the switching 
system have been effectively implemented but have failed to shift perceptions. Simil arly 
removing automated rollover and forcing a choice point for consumers each year has been 
required in insurance products but was not pursued in which the case of bank accounts.  
4.  What is the s olution  to these issues?  
The solution to credence goods proble ms lies not on the supply side but instead on the 
demand side of the market. It involves aggregating experiences of those consumers with 
similar characteristics in order to help consumers understand the average value of 
different products for their ‘type’.  This enables consumers to compare the experiences of 
those like them that have already experienced a specific product sold by a given firm 
against that benchmark. Where consumers expect they can obtain value by searching and 
comparing across products, mor e will do so, and this drives incentives for firms to offer 
better value.  
Since outcomes depend on  post-choice behaviour as well as pre -existing characteristics, 
these benchmarks also require information on this behaviour if they are to be of value. 
For e xample, how much exercise did the patient take, how many lectures did the student 
skip. Otherwise, variations in outcomes can easily be mistakenly attributed to differences 
in the product rather than differences in behaviour of those that purchase the prod uct. 
Where this happens, trust in the validity of the benchmark can evaporate and its value 
therefore diminishes.  
Health and education are classic examples of credence goods. Indeed the credence good 
problem leads many governments to fix the prices of the se services (if indeed they use 
any market mechanisms to improve the quality and efficiency of these services).8 In a 
healthcare setting, say the market for replacement knee surgery, the solution might 
involve a description of the average increase in mobility that patients with a certain 
diagnosis and certain characteristics experience post -surgery. Consumers are th en able to 
compare the average increase in mobility for patients with their diagnosis and 
characteristics at a specific hospital against that benchmark in order to understand 
whether they are likely to get a relatively good deal or not. Alternatively, in a  university 
setting it might be the average wage premium achieved by students that take a particular 
course at a particular university given a particular set of grades at entry. In these cases, 
there can be important unobservable exogenous factors that aff ect the outcome, but which 
are outside the firm’s control. Most notably the effort put in by the patient (or student), 
and unobserved pre -existing conditions that create unexpected complications.  
In banking, things are simpler since the final price is largely dependent on post -choice 
behaviour rather than pre -choice characteristics. Moreover, as result of technological 
developments, almost everything that is relevant to the outcome can be observed and 
recorded in a data file. This data file of a consumer’s behaviour can crystallise the 
consumer’s sometimes -vague recollections of their behaviour and allows them to obtain a 
more accurate quote from rivals. It also creates the possibility for consumers  to use this 
information to analyse and change their own behaviour to better reflect and achieve their 
preferences. A system of open APIs recognises that these data files belong to the 
consumer as much as the firm that collects them.  
Clarifying that th e property right to data collected on their behaviour remains the 
consumers , and cannot be signed away exclusively through small print conditions, allows 5. COMPETITION AND OPEN APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE STANDARDS IN BANKING  │ 103 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 consumers  to trade and hence to extract value from that data. Moreover, the value of the 
data is maximise d by setting a standard format that makes it easier to trade. For example, 
consumers might choose to sell their data file to third party apps that analyse the data and 
create value for the consumer. These apps might reduce the price that consumers pay by 
searching and switching them into and out of different products for different transactions, 
by efficiently reallocating their funds and credit across different products at different 
times; or by opening up new specialised options whose availability depends on the offeror 
knowing more about the consumer’s behaviour (e.g. credit). Alternatively, app producers 
might help consumers analyse and change their spending/saving behaviour by designing 
personalised plans to nudge them into behaviours that help them to a chieve their longer -
term preferences (rather than gratifying their possibly inconsistent short -term 
preferences).  
UK approach  
The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority released its provisional findings on the 
banking market in October 2015, identifying c oncerns and setting out possible remedies 
including the type of Open API that the Open Banking Working Group would later 
recommend in early 2016. In its final decision the CMA decided to require the nine 
largest banks to provide open standardised API data on their retail customer and SME 
account data to third parties (where the consumer elected to do so).9 This uses digital 
technology to create the possibility of a new market for firms to design applications that 
advise and help consumers to better manage t heir money and the financial products they 
use. 
The CMA suggested it had two main aims in adopting the Open Banking Standard into 
regulation, namely:  
 to make it easier for customers to switch current account providers, thus 
increasing competition  
 “to chang e [the] nature of the customer journey itself by facilitating the 
emergence [of] a large scale of new service providers with different business 
models offering innovative solutions.”  
All of this is much more ambitious than traditional demand side remedies to competition 
investigations which have often focused on making information on the product available 
(not on consumers use of the product), and then leaving the consumer with the 
responsibility for using it. Instead, here the objective is to fundamentally  change the way 
that consumers purchase by creating the building blocks (e.g. property rights, data 
standards) that facilitate the emergence of new service providers with different business 
models that offer innovative solution s. This pro -active design of a role for new business 
models in a malfunctioning market is a big step for competition agencies that are 
traditionally minded to let incentivise innovation, remove regulatory barriers, and stand 
back and let it happen (as Price Comparison Websites did).  
Competition Agencies are traditionally sceptical (and rightly so) of arguments that they 
should mandate access for rivals to certain assets that firms have invested in building on 
the basis that they constitute essential facilities. A firm’s right to refus e to deal with a 
rival is therefore very rarely challenged (and then typically only in cases where the firm 
received the asset without investing in it,  for example through privatisation). However, in 
an era of concern at big data and its impact on the abil ity for rivals to compete, there are 
increasing populist demands for such access to rivals to be granted. In contrast, by simply 104 │ 5. COMPETITION AND OPEN APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE STANDARDS IN BANKING  
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   clarifying a consumer’s property right to their own data, the API remedy neatly sidesteps 
questions of whether or not the data is an essential facility, allows firms to continue to 
refuse to deal with rivals if they wish to do so, while also allowing consumers to decide 
whether or not to do their own deals with these rivals. Helpfully, this means that the rivals 
pay a market price  for the data, rather than having a price determined by what is 
considered a fair, reasonable and non -discriminatory price (FRAND).  
It is true that by making it difficult for a bank to agree with a consumer that it will have 
exclusive access to their data , the remedy makes the retention of the consumer less 
valuable to the bank (since the profit to be made by using the data is reduced). In a well -
functioning market, the firm would therefore pay the consumer less for its data. However, 
since the market inve stigation identified that the market was not functioning well, and 
that these nine firms had significant market power, this concern did not arise in this case. 
However, in other cases where the market is working more effectively, the concern might 
have som e merit, and so using the same remedy might have important drawbacks (if 
indeed evidence suggested that the firms paid consumers for the data).  
EU approach  
At the same time, the EU has developed and put in place its new payment services 
directive (PSD2). This applies to all payment accounts not just current accounts. Like the 
CMA approach, it breaks down bank’ s monopoly on their user’s data and allows third 
parties  to make payments for consumers, and to display and manage multiple accounts on 
a single appl ication.  
However, it is in some respects less ambitious than the CMA remedy. Firstly, it does not 
require a common standard and so allows banks to make their data available through 
different standards. This allows the banks to raise the costs of rival thi rd parties and hence 
reduce the strength of the competitive constraint that they provide. Secondly, it opens the 
data only to specific institutions and so does not allow for third parties such as price 
comparison websites or other independent application d esigners to access the data. In that 
sense, it is less open than the CMA remedy.   
These differences appear to demonstrate the added teeth that can be provided where the 
effect of a problematic feature of the market has been evidenced through a market revi ew. 
However, it is also notable that as a result it is not tied to only those markets in which a 
problem had been identified. This means that it can be applied more broadly than the 
CMA remedy and so for example it will apply to markets such as savings acc ounts or 
mortgages in which no competition issues has been identified.  
US and Australian approaches  
In the US, there is not an open API standard, however there are some third party 
applications that are providing some of the services that API can facilita te. They are able 
to do so using screen -scraping techniques that ask consumers for their log in information 
to different accounts and then scrape the account data out of those accounts. There remain 
question marks over the safety of these techniques. This is because the app asks the user 
to share their  bank log -in details, and the app uses these to access the accounts on the 
users  behalf. In effect , the app poses as the user to see the information. Th ere is therefore 
a risk that th is may open users  up to li ability if money goes missing, and may violate the 
bank’s terms of service .10  5. COMPETITION AND OPEN APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE STANDARDS IN BANKING  │ 105 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 US banks are using API, however, they are tending to use it to work with partners to 
develop applications that provide services for their own accountholders. For example, 
Chase a nd Intuit, and Wells Fargo with Xero and Finicity.  
In Australia, the Parliamentary Economics Committee last year announced that, in line 
with the recommendations of the Productivity Commission, Australia’s four largest banks 
will be required to enable ope n API access by 2018. The Treasury was then asked to 
undertake an independent review of what the scheme should involve. The review reported 
in February 2018 and identified the importance of common standards and recommended 
that an “Australian Data Standard  Setting Body, chaired by an independent data 
specialist, should design these Standards (using the UK’s technical specification as a 
starting point).”11 Notably one of those banks (National) has already chosen to make its 
APIs openly available.12 
5.  How might API be blocked? What might  block it ?  
Open common API standards pose a significant threat to banks. These banks face being 
relegated to one side of a new platform market, and hence see their margins squeezed as 
the platforms compete for users. The size of potential damage to banks position could 
therefore be substantial. The Bank of England estimates that competitive pressure could 
mean that in 5 years’ time the aggregate profits of UK banks are £1.1 billion lower than at 
present. Moreover, it consider ed this may well be an underestimate and that Open 
Banking may cause greater and faster disruption to banks’ business models than banks 
project.13 With the stakes this high, there is inevitably the risk that incumbents will 
engage in anticompetitive behaviour to  block or capture rents. For instance, the digital 
platform model in ebook markets led publishers to collude to protect their profit 
margins.14  
In banking, the large banks have historically been very successfully in obtaining 
significant rents by appealing  to their systematic importance (too -big-to-fail) and the 
distribution of these rents has resulted in employees of financial institutions becoming an 
increasingly large proportion of the richest 1 and 0.1% whose income and wealth have 
pulled away from the rest of society .15 This appears to have triggered a corrosive effect on 
the public’s trust in market mechanisms and globalisation as a whole. It is therefore 
important that the slower burning competitive threat to bank profit margins from API is 
allowed to play out in a way that was not possible during the financial crisis (due to the 
urgent need to maintain stability in the interests of all as the crisis unfolded).  
In practice, this means firstly no regulatory protection for banks from the threat of API. 
Secondly, it means zero tolerance on banks refusing to provide open access to their 
consumers’ data  in a standardised format (where their consumers consent). Finally, it 
means careful scrutiny of any collusive or exclusionary allegations, not just against th e 
banks but also against those that might seek to leverage their position in associated 
markets. For instance, firms providing operating systems have been accused of using their 
dominant position in that market to exclude smaller rivals to their online sho pping and 
mapping services. In such cases, there is always a question of why those firms do not 
extract the full monopoly profit straight from the operating system market in which they 
hold the dominant position, rather than reducing the profit they take i n that market as 
leverage in order to create a dominant position in the tied market. The thinking being that 
it can only earn the monopoly profit once (the  single monopoly profit defence). However, 
this often does not hold. For example tying products can i ncrease market power in either 
the operating systems market (further protecting an already dominant position from 106 │ 5. COMPETITION AND OPEN APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE STANDARDS IN BANKING  
 
 
FINANCIAL MARKETS, INSURANCE A ND PENSIONS: DIGITAL ISATION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018   competitive entry), or the tied market, for example by increasing the costs of rivals in that 
market by denying them economies of scale or net work effects. In addition, it can also 
facilitate price discrimination among buyers of operating systems (if buyers use varying 
quantities of the tied product) and/or buyers of the tied product (if there is not a strong 
positive demand correlation between the two products).16  
6.  Might API create additional problems?  
As discussed these API driven applications may benefit from considerable cross -platform 
network effects. This might mean that they, like other platforms with strong cross -
platform network effects, might tend towards tipping into monopolies. The fear is that 
such monopolies are not contestable as they are protected by strong economies of scale 
that are created by the cross -platform network effects. The fear is then that the creation of 
a market for A PI driven applications might simply replace an inert and oligopolistic 
banking market with a monopolised banking platform market. In such a situation, 
consumers that pay higher prices to the platform rather than the banks might feel that 
little has changed  and their situation is not improved.   
This concern is recognisable to those leading the start -ups in this area such as Monzo’s 
CEO Blomfield: “Blomfield is positioning Monzo for precisely this eventuality. “We tend 
to avoid the M word” – monopoly – “for various reasons,” he says. “But I think it's true. I 
do think one player will have a massive market share.”17  
However, such concerns may well turn out to be baseless (or overly optimistic from the 
perspective of aspirant monopolists). Firstly, it is not at  all clear that strong network or 
cross -platform network effects would exist in this new market. For example, if all banks, 
or at least all large banks, have to provide open standardised APIs then any third party 
application would be able to provide the sa me coverage as a potentially dominant 
application provider (thus removing the scope for differences in cross -platform network 
effects enjoyed by different applications). Similarly, it is unclear why consumers would 
obtain more value from using the same app lication as other consumers. Secondly, if an 
incumbent application’s access to some consumer data were, for some reason, to enable it 
to build more attractive services for other consumers (as Google’s search algorithm is 
said to), then there would in any c ase remain the option for third party applications to 
offer to pay consumers for consent to access to their API data. By re -establishing price 
competition this would then provide those entrants with their own attractive product with 
a means by which to ent er and gain a foothold and the volume required to achieve the 
same economies of scale as the incumbent.  
7.  Conclusion  
Open API standards in banking can increase competition by fundamentally changing the 
way that consumers purchase  banking services. In particular, they facilitate the entry of 
new business models that help consumers to obtain better value from their existing 
banking services, and to move between services without consumers having to do the hard 
work of evaluating how different offers fit with their requirements (which can be 
identified in their usage data).  
The article argues that these demonstrate a way for the state, or rather its independent 
competition agency, to be entrepreneurial and exercise a vision of how dig ital innovation 
can make markets work better for consumers, while remaining consistent with the 5. COMPETITION AND OPEN APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE STANDARDS IN BANKING  │ 107 
 
 
FINANCIAL MARK ETS, INSURANCE AND P ENSIONS: DIGITALISAT ION AND FINANCE  © OECD 2018  
  
 principles of competitive neutrality (which can pose challenges to other proposed roles 
for an entrepreneurial state).  
The article also highlight the importanc e of competition agencies not being restricted to 
examining and resolving supply side problems if they are to be effective in making 
competition work for consumers. Effective markets require an active and empowered 
demand -side, and this requires much more than simply protecting them from mis -selling 
and other unfair practices, this is well demonstrated in the case of open API standards.

3. Another example of the use of open APIs in banking has recently arrived in the form of the 
Gates Foundation’s recently released open API for mobile money interoperability. This open  
API makes it easy for mobile money providers to integrate their applications with an open 
source blockchain -powered payment platform called Mojaloop, thereby creating 
interoperability between a customer’s mobile money provider and those banks, merchants, 
government institutions and other mobile money providers that build products using the 
Mojaloop open API.  
4. A slightly different API is needed to construct an application that provides payment initiation services, 
rather than account information services.  Therefore, there is typically one set of APIs for Account 
Information Service Providers (AISPs) and another set for Payment Initiation Service Providers 
(PISPs).

case. However, this automatic roll -over effect has been addressed effectively in other 
markets by restricting the length of contract

Services” OECD, 2017. For example, France, Germany, Norway and the UK all set fixed 
tariffs for hea lthcare services in their publicly funded healthcare markets. Similarly, the UK 
and other countries generally fix the price that they reimburse state schools for each pupil 
whose parents choose to send them there (see OECD, School Choice and School Voucher s: 
An OECD perspective, 2017).

role of the CMA’s remedies has been key in delivering Open API standards.
