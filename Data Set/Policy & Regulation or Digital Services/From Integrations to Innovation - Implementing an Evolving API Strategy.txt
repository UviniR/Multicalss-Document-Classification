THE LIMITATIONS OF  USING API s FOR  ONE-OFF INTEGRATIONSThe Limitations of Using APIs for 
One-Off Integrations 
Making information systems and functionalities available 
to external parties via open application programming 
interfaces (APIs) provides exciting opportunities for 
start-ups and innovation-focused businesses to build 
products that can reach low-income customers. But all too 
often, digital financial services (DFS) providers treat APIs as 
ad hoc contracts that define how each individual third-party 
partner can access their data and services. Used in this way, 
APIs end up creating one-off integrations that are costly and 
inefficient. As these integrations multiply, they can quickly 
create an internal IT architecture that looks like a mess of 
spaghetti and adds to an organization’s complexity.
DFS providers are better off adopting a strategic approach 
to APIs. By getting the basics right from the start, a DFS 
provider can generate early benefits, including faster 
internal product development and lower partner onboarding 
costs.1 A structured, learn-as-you-go model allows DFS 
providers to start with a small number of API offerings that 
match their current business needs. Providers learn from 
their initial experiences, build capacity, and introduce new 
revenue models for their APIs when they better understand 
the market dynamics.
This paper outlines important considerations and initial 
actions for DFS providers who are ready to move from one-off API integrations to an iterative process of building 
open APIs, in which continual learning generates new 
revenue opportunities and helps third parties to develop 
products that bring more people into the financial system.
Getting Started: How to 
Implement
You do not need a completely worked out API strategy 
at the outset. Start small by creating a limited number of 
APIs based on existing partners’ needs. Provide these APIs 
to third-party businesses in a secure manner, learn from 
their user experiences, and iterate. It is essential to build 
the foundations first and gradually expand in partnership 
with external parties who can help you identify business 
opportunities and market value for future API product 
releases. As you observe what partners build, you can test 
business models and pricing strategies. The initial goal is to 
engage a group of businesses whose leaders and developers 
are eager to build commercial applications with your APIs. 
As all of this implies, APIs are not just a technical issue. 
Moving from integration-only APIs toward a more open 
approach means engaging developers and start-ups as 
an important new type of business partner and, in some 
instances, customer.

FROM  INTEGRATIONS TO  INNOVATIONFive Actions to Take Early in Your 
Open API Journey
1.  Get management’s buy-in. The C-level and lines of 
business managers need to understand the potential of 
open APIs to transform business processes and to create 
new products and revenue streams.
2.  Appoint an API team. Your API team should include 
a product manager as well as business, IT, and risk 
management leads. Having a product manager is 
critical, otherwise your API efforts are likely to 
stagnate. He or she will work with a technical lead 
to identify and prioritize business use cases for APIs, 
and to clearly communicate them to the internal 
development team responsible for building your APIs. 
A product manager should also encourage the API team 
to consider additional business model opportunities as 
external businesses begin to use the APIs.
3.  Learn from developers. Talk with third-party 
businesses and their developers to learn which APIs 
they need to build innovative solutions for existing and 
new customers.
4.  Build an inventory. Identify low-risk capabilities that 
have value for third-party business partners and could 
be opened via APIs. Reach out to early adopters of your 
APIs to get a better sense of what they want to build 
and which APIs they will need in the future. These 
developers are co-creators who can help you identify 
your APIs’ business model and revenue opportunities.
5.  Address technology gaps.  Consider conducting a 
technology gap analysis to determine the minimum 
requirements to open low-risk APIs to external 
third parties, such as a minimum viable product 
developer portal.From Integrations to Innovation: 
Creating reusable building blocks
An API evolution model can help DFS providers to move 
quickly from one-off integrations to a steady process of 
opening new APIs gradually and monitoring the market’s 
reaction. There are four stages of growth in this model:
Initial.  The DFS provider builds APIs over and over again 
for each of its individual partners. The inefficiency of this 
approach often causes bottlenecks in processing partnership 
agreements, resulting in a long list of partners waiting 
for the APIs. Costs pile up because the provider plays a 
significant role in each new onboarding project.
Enablement.  The DFS provider shares a standard, secure 
set of APIs with its partners. Partners bear the costs of 
integrating with the APIs, and because it is in their interests 
to do so, they work quickly to integrate the APIs into 
new products. Some may be willing to pay a transaction 
fee immediately for business routed through the API. 
Others may want to experiment with product and service 
integration ideas to gauge their customer’s reactions before 
paying a fee. Partners are often open to discussing the 
options at this state.
Experimental.  The DFS provider works with external 
developers to turn its APIs into full-fledged market products 
with a monetization strategy. It scales open APIs as part of a 
catalog of new products.
Committed. The DFS provider puts in place the final 
arrangements for its new APIs, including partnership 
agreements confirming the availability and performance of 
APIs and clear monetization and revenue-sharing models. It 
starts to build a road map of other APIs that developers in 
third-party businesses may need. New APIs are introduced 
that repeat the enablement and experimental phases.3 WHO IS DOING THIS WELL?Who Is Doing This Well? 
Examples from Industry
Safaricom: In Kenya, Safaricom’s processes for onboarding 
API partners were for a long time neither efficient nor 
transparent. The huge demand for the company’s APIs 
resulted in a significant backlog.2 Because of the impact 
one-to-one integrations had on Safaricom’s ability to build 
an ecosystem of product partners, the company moved to 
an open API model, offering certain low-risk-high-revenue-
potential APIs. Safaricom initially offered open APIs in beta 
(early release) format to see how external businesses engaged 
with them and later upgraded the offering.3
BBVA:  In Spain, BBVA Bank started by creating a suite of 
APIs that were accessible in a self-service portal. The APIs 
were free of charge in a sandbox (testing only) environment. 
The bank has since commercially deployed a rich set of 
product APIs, including a data API that allows third parties

area, by industry sector and consumer demographics.4 
This API is now helping businesses decide where to build 
stores and has stimulated the tourism industry by giving 
it a deeper understanding of travelers’ expenditures and 
demographics.5
MercadoLibre:  In Latin America, e-commerce platform 
MercadoLibre has provided APIs to third parties who offer 
services like accounting, delivery tracking, analytics, and 
marketing to businesses in 19 countries. In Argentina, this 
has allowed small business lending fintech Moon Money 
Online  to lend to small businesses that have not been able 
to get credit from larger financiers.6 Using MercadoLibre’s 
open APIs (after gaining a small business’ consent), Moon 
Money is able to mine the business’ transactions on the 
MercadoLibre platform and calculate a credit score. This is 
a win-win: Moon Money reaches new customers and small 
businesses get access to credit so they can grow.FIGURE 1.  API maturity model for DFS providers

Degree of Openess4
FROM  INTEGRATIONS TO  INNOVATIONDFS providers should assess their own 
strategic efforts against the API maturity 
model:
• What is the current cost of individual integrations? 
How long is the onboarding queue?
• Can a productized approach to opening APIs create 
something useful for most third-party partners?
• Can a conversation with business partners and 
developers help identify which APIs would enable 
them to become ecosystem leaders?And as the businesses sell more products, MercadoLibre 
receives higher sales commissions and sees an increase in 
buyers visiting their platform.
Implications for DFS Providers
Speed is market share. The API landscape for payments and 
mobile money in emerging markets is changing rapidly. 
DFS providers who do nothing with APIs risk being left 
behind in this new competitive landscape.
Third parties will create innovative applications with the 
API platform they are most comfortable using and that 
gives them the greatest potential customer base. Yet as more 
and more DFS providers start offering APIs, providers 
will have to compete to onboard the most innovative API 
partners. Third parties who are already using one provider’s 
APIs will hesitate to move to a new supplier. Early movers 
have the opportunity to learn first, gain traction, and 
building long-term relationships with partners.cgap.org
