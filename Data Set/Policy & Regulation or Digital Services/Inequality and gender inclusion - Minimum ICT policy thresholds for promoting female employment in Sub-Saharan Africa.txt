Inclusive development ABSTRACT  
The study assesses how ICT modulates the effect of inequality on female economic participation in 
a panel of 42 countries in sub-Saharan Africa over the period 2004 –2014. Three inequality in-
dicators are used, namely: the Gini coefficient, the Atkinson index and the Palma ratio. The 
adopted ICT indicators are mobile phone penetration, internet penetration and fixed broadband 
subscriptions. Three gender economic inclusion indicators are also used for the analysis, namely: 
female labour force participation, female unemployment and female employment. The General -
ised Method of Moments is employed as empirical strategy. The findings show that enhancing ICT 
beyond certain thresholds is necessary for ICT to mitigate inequality in order to enhance gender 
economic participation. First, for female labour force participation, a minimum threshold of 
165.714 mobile phone penetration per 100 people is required for the Palma ratio. Second, 
minimum ICT thresholds for the reduction of female unemployment are: (i) 87.783, 107.486 and 
152.500 mobile phone penetration per 100 people for respectively, the Gini coefficient, the 
Atkinson index and the Palma ratio; (ii) 39.618 internet penetration per 100 people for the 
Atkinson index and (iii) 4.500 fixed broadband subscritptions for the Palma ratio. Third, the 
corresponding ICT thresholds for the promotion of female employment are: (i) 120.369 and 
85.533 mobile phone penetration per 100 people for respectively, the Gini coefficient and the 
Atkinson index and (ii) 30.005 internet penetration per 100 people for the Gini coefficient. The 
established thresholds make economic sense and can be feasibly implemented by policy makers in 
order to induce favourable effects on gender economic inclusion dynamics.   
1.Introduction 
In Africa, gender inequality costs approximately 2.5 trillion USD according to a World Bank report (Nkurunziza, 2018 ; World Bank, 
2018 ). In line with the narrative, in nations that are poor, women mostly work in the informal sector of the economy in occupations 
that range from self-employment in petty trading to agricultural activities that are fundamentally devoted to subsistence. Recom -
mendations are made to involve more women in the formal economic sector because such involvement is associated with a multitude 
of positive economic and welfare externalities. The engagement of the female gender in the formal economic sector can be enhanced

2through, inter alia: education, reduction of income inequality, improvements in financial services and provision of basic infrastruc -
ture.1 This research partly builds on the policy recommendations and focuses on how information and communication technology 
(ICT) infrastructure can be used to moderate the effect income inequality on gender participation in the formal economic sector in 
sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). There are also three complementary elements of motivation that merit critical expansion, notably: (i) the 
dual concerns of income inequality and gender exclusion in the post-2015 development era of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); 
(ii) the importance of information technology in the promotion of inclusive development in contemporary literature and (iii) gaps in 
recent literature pertaining to inclusive human development. 
First, in accordance with recent inequality literature, income inequality and female economic participation are crucial in the 
achievement of SDGs in SSA (Robinson, 2015; Bicaba, Brixiova, & Ncube, 2017; Efobi, Tanakem and Asongu, 2018; Tchamyou, 2019, 
2020). Inequality is a critical policy concern because according to Asongu and le Roux (2019) and Asongu and Kodila-Tedika (2017), 
the African poverty tragedy is not being solved because economic growth experienced by SSA over the recent two decades of resur -
gence in economic prosperity did not trickle down to the poorer factions of the population. A consequence of this inequitable dis-
tribution of the fruits of economic prosperity is that close to half of the countries in SSA did not reach the threshold of extreme poverty 
reduction related to the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) extreme poverty target. 
In the light of the SDGs, the concern of reducing extreme poverty to a benchmark of below 3% is even more concerning because 
Bicaba et al. (2017) have concluded that unless inequality is addressed significantly, SSA will not achieve the underlying SDG extreme 
poverty target. Drawing on the high gender exclusion in SSA, it is apparent that gender inequality is a dimension of inequality that will 
further dampen the negative responsiveness of extreme poverty to economic growth. Gender equality in the formal economic sector is 
fundamental in poverty alleviation because it provides women with a plethora of opportunities that help in the improvements of 
household and economic wellbeing (Efobi, Tanaken, & Asongu, 2018). Robinson (2015) maintains that gender equality is central in the 
achievement of SDGs, not only because of improvements in the rights of the female gender but also because the enhancement of 
economic opportunities for women and girls engenders positive human welfare and economic ramifications. According to the author, 
beyond the factor of human rights, gender inclusion is important because no economy can grow sustainably if majority of its popu -
lation is marginalized in the informal economic sector. It is important to recall that SSA has the highest female poverty rate in the world 
(Hazel, 2010) and the underlying poverty rate is substantially traceable to non involvement of women in formal economic activities. A 
policy instrument that can be leveraged upon in order to involve more women in the formal economic sector is the burgeoning ICT 
phenomenon. 
Second, an important body of literature has been recently devoted to articulating the relevance of ICT in mitigating socio-economic 
differences across and within countries. From the perspective of Africa, ICT is documented to improve economic and human wellbeing 
on the plethora of fronts, including: improvement of agricultural productivity, enhancement of corporate performance, reduction of 
income disparities between the rich and the poor, facilitation of improved health outcomes and availment of financial access. Some of 
the contemporary studies supporting these highlighted ICT externalities are: Afutu-Kotey, Gough, and Owusu (2017); Minkoua Nzie, 
Bidogeza and Ngum (2018); Abor, Amidu, and Issahaku (2018); Asongu and Nwachukwu (2018a); Gosavi (2018); Humbani and Wiese 
(2018) and Asongu and Boateng (2018). It is also worthwhile to emphasize that information technology is particularly important in 
promoting inclusive economic and human development in SSA because the sub-region has a high potential for ICT penetration, 
compared to other regions of the world which are characterised by higher levels of economic inclusion and saturation in the pene-
tration of information technology. According to the attendant literature, the high potential for ICT penetration in Africa implies that it 
can be leveraged as a policy instrument to address growing needs for more human inclusion and socio-economic development (Asongu, 
2013; Asongu & Odhiambo, 2019a; Penard, Poussing, Yebe, & Ella, 2012; Tchamyou, 2017). In the light of these insights, this research 
is positioned on the relevance of ICT in modulating the effect of inequaliuty on female economic participation because of a gap in 
contemporary literature. 
Third, to the best of our knowledge, the concemporary development literature with emphasis on gender inclusion in Africa has 
largely focused on, inter alia: connnetions between access to finance and mobile money with moderations from social and gender 
networks (Bongomin, Ntayi, Munene, & Malinga, 2018); the involvement of rural women and rural farmers in programs that are 
oriented towards ICT-driven agricultural expansion (Uduji & Okolo-Obasi, 2018a; Uduji, Okolo-Obasi, & Asongu, 2019a, 2019b, 
2019c, 2019d, 2019e); linkages beween gender disparities and inclusive finance (Kairiza, Kiprono, & Magadzire, 2017); the imperative 
of promoting females in scientific fields (Elu, 2018); gender involvement in informal and financial sectors of production (Bayraktar & 
Fofack, 2018); the relationship underlying financial inclusion and gender exclusion in microfinance (Mannah-Blankson, 2018); gender 
involvement in agricultural production that is sustainable (Theriault, Smale, & Haider, 2017) and the importance of information 
technology in gender inclusion in the formal economic sector (Efobi et al., 2018). 
Among the engaged studies, the study closest to this research is Efobi et al. (2018) which has investigated how ICT affects the 
participation of the female gender in the formal economic sector. Using data from 1990 to 2014, the study has established a positive 
nexus between ICT penetration and gender inclusion in SSA. It is worthwhile to emphasize that Efobi et al. (2018) use three: (i) gender 
inclusion proxies (female unemployment, female labour force participation and female employment); (ii) ICT dynamics (fixed 
broadband subscriptions, mobile phone penetration and internet penetration) and (iii) regression techniques (i.e. fixed effects, or-
dinary least squares and generalised method of moments estimations). 
This research extends Efobi et al. (2018) from two main standpoints. On the one hand, in line with the motivational strands

participation” and “gender economic inclusion” are used interchangeably throughout the study. S.A. Asongu and N.M.

3discussed in the preceding paragraphs, instead of focusing directly on the connection between ICT and female economic participation, 
ICT is tailored to moderate the effect of inequality on female economic participation. Accordingly, ICT is considered as a policy in-
strument for female economic participation while inequality is acknowledged as a policy syndrome in gender economic inclusion 
because the response of inclusive economic development decreases with increasing levels of inequality (Fosu, 2008, 2009; 2010a, 
2015). To this end, the estimation approach is tailored such that the ICT policy variables moderate the effect of the policy syndrome (or 
inequality) on female economic participation. This interactive specification departs from Efobi et al. (2018) with the argument that it is 
not enough to provide policy makers and scholars with simple nexuses among macroeconomic variables. In essence, going further to 
assess how policy variables interact with policy syndromes to affect the outcome variables is more informative to policy makers. 
On the other hand, as opposed to Efobi et al. (2018) who have presented findings based on signs and magnitude of ICT impacts on 
gender economic inclusion, this paper is tailored to provide ICT policy thresholds that can be leveraged by policy makers to induce the 
targeted effects on gender inclusion. Accordingly, this study argues that it is not enough to simply provide nexuses between ICT 
variables and macroeconomic outcomes: research should go beyond such linkages by disclosing specific ICT policy thresholds that are 
important in modulating the effect of policy syndromes (such as inequality) for gender inclusiveness in the formal economic sector. 
The rest of the paper is organised in the following structure. The theoretical underpinnings are highlighted in Section 2 while the 
data and methodology are discussed in section 3. Section 4 discloses the empirical results whereas section 5 concludes with impli -
cations and future research directions. 
2.Theoretical highlights and intuition 
The theoretical foundation consolidating the nexus between ICT, inequality and gender economic inclusion fundamentally builds 
on the relevance of knowledge diffusion in human and socio-economic developments (Kwan & Chiu, 2015). In essence, neoclassical 
models are supportive of the perspective that ICT is essential for politico-economic and social progress in countries, especially when 
these nations are at the beginning of industrialisation (Abramowitz, 1986; Bernard & Jones, 1996; Asongu, Nwachukwu, & Aziz, 
2018). Examples of contemporary studies that have built on these neoclassical theoretical insights to establish the importance of ICT in 
inclusive development are: Bongomin et al. (2018); Uduji and Okolo-Obasi (2018a, 2018b); Muthinja and Chipeta (2018) and Asongu, 
le Roux, Nwachukwu, and Pyke (2019). 
The theoretical literature is consistent with the position that ICT provides opportunities of inclusive development because, it, inter 
alia: (i) avails networks that reduce distances between economic operators and entrepreneurs who may need to physically displace 
themselves (Efobi et al., 2018; Shaikh & Karjaluoto, 2015; Ureta, 2008, pp. 83–92). (ii) ICT also mitigates asymmetric information that 
is associated with economic activities (Asongu & Nwachukwu, 2018b). Such reduction in information asymmetry decreases economic 
costs and increases the timely availability of information that is essential for the smooth and effective implementation of entrepre -
neurial operations. Moreover with ICT, developmental inputs are more affordable and possibility frontiers are also enlarged (Smith, 
Spence, & Rashid, 2011). (iii) The inclusive development opportunities from ICT are more apparent in poorer fractions of the pop-
ulation compared to their rich counterparts. This theoretical insight is consistent with Asongu (2015) who has concluded that ICT 
reduces inequality in Africa. It is also important to recall that Efobi et al. (2018) have established that ICT enhances female economic 
participation. Hence: the intuition motivating this study on the role of ICT in modulating the effect of inequality on female economic 
participation. 
It is relevant to also emphasize that while this study builds on the discussed theoretical underpinnings, it is equally framed as an 
evidence-based applied economics study in the light of the policy relevance motivating the problem statement. As recently argued by 
Asongu and Odhiambo (2020a), applied economics for policy purpose is not exclusively buttressed on the imperative to accept or reject 
prevaling theoretical underpinnings. It follows that this study is positioned within the context and evolving literature which supports 
the perspective that applied economics can also be relevant in theory-building (Narayan, Mishra, & Narayan, 2011; Costantini & Lupi, 
2005; Asongu & Nwachukwu, 2016a). Following insights from the relevant literature, evidence-based applied economics that is also a 
useful scientific activity should be based on sound intuition. In line with the narratives throughout the introduction, the intuition 
underpinning this study is quite easy to follow: levels of inequality influence female economic participation and ICT can be leveraged 
as a policy instrument to mitigate the negative influence of exisiting levels of inequality on female economic participation. The 
interactive analytical framework is therefore suggestive of the fact that some minimum levels of ICT penetration are needed in order 
for ICT penetration to mitigate the negative incidence of inequality on female economic inclusion. 
The discussed intuition can also be substantiated by providing empirical evidence on the negative role of existing levels of 
inequality on inclusive economic development. Accordingly, the exisiting literature supports the perspective that inclusive economic 
development (which includes inclusive economic participation) is negatively affected by inequality. To put these empirical insights 
into more perspective: “The study finds that the responsiveness of poverty to income is a decreasing function of inequality” (Fosu, 2010b, p. 
818); “The responsiveness of poverty to income is a decreasing function of inequality, and the inequality elasticity of poverty is actually larger 
than the income elasticity of poverty” (Fosu, 2010c, p. 1432); and “In general, high initial levels of inequality limit the effectiveness of growth in 
reducing poverty while growing inequality increases poverty directly for a given level of growth” (Fosu, 2011, p. 11). The conclusions of Fosu 
broadly apply to mainstream measurements of inequality used in the attendant inclusive development literature, namely: the Gini 
coefficient, the Atkinson index and the Palma ratio. These three inequality indicators are used in this study. The conclusions of Fosu are 
also important in justifying this research because, as we have seen from theoretical highlights in this section, ICT policies from 
governments are designed to reduce income inequality and by extension improve inclusive human development which entails gender 
inclusive economic participation. 
Given the above insights, the corresponding research question this inquiry aims to tackle is the following: what minimum ICT S.A. Asongu and N.M. Odhiambo                                                                                                                                                                                  Telecommunications Policy xxx (xxxx) xxx
4policy thresholds are needed to mitigate inequality and promote female economic participation in sub-Saharan Africa? To address this 
question, two hypotheses have to be tested, notably: inequality should affect female economic inclusion negatively while the inter-
action between inequality and ICT should have the opposite incidence on female economic inclusion. 
Hypothesis 1.there are negative unconditional impacts from the incidences of inequality on female economic inclusion. 
Hypothesis 2.there are positive conditional impacts from the interaction between ICT dynamics and inequality on female economic 
participation.2 
It follows that inequality unconditionally reduces female employment and increases female unemployment while ICT modulates 
the unconditional incidence of inequality for a positive effect on female economic participation. 
The discussed hypotheses are in line with stylized facts pertaining to linkages between the dynamics of inequality and female 
economic participation. In Fig. 1, below, associations between an inequality variable (i.e. the Gini coefficient) and female economic 
participation variables are presented. On the figure, from the left hand-side to the right hand-side are respectively, nexuses between: (i) 
inequality and the female labour force participation rate; (ii) inequality and female unemployment and (iii) inequality and female 
employment. It is apparent from the attendant graphs that inequality is negatively associated with female employment (i.e. third 
graph) and positively linked with female unemployment (i.e. second graph). 
3.Data and methodology 
3.1. Data 
This research is focused on 42 countries in SSA using data from 2004 to 2014.3 The adopted sample of countries and periodicity of 
investigation are constrained by issues of data availability at the time of the study. Four main sources are used to obtain the data, 
notably (i) the three inequality indicators (i.e. the Gini coefficient, the Atkinson index and the Palma ratio): are obtained from the 
Global Consumption and Income Project (GCIP). (ii) Three gender-inclusive indicators on female economic participation come from 
the International Labor Organisation (i.e. female labor force participation, female unemployment and female employment). (iii) The 
ICT variables are sourced from World Development Indicators of the World Bank (i.e. mobile phone penetration, internet penetration, 
fixed broadband subscriptions). Moreover a control variable is also obtained from the same source (i.e. remittances). The use of 
selected ICT indicators is motivated by contemporary ICT literature (Asongu & Tchamyou, 2020 ; Ejemeyovwi & Osabuohien, 2020 ; 
Karakara & Osabuohien, 2019 ; Tchamyou, 2017 ). (iv) Another control variable (i.e. political stability) is obtained from the World 
Governance Indicators of the World Bank. 
The motivation for adopting three control variables is consistent with contemporary inequality literature (Meniago & Asongu, 
2018 ; Tchamyou, 2019 , 2020 ). While the Gini coefficient reflects the manner in which income is distributed across the population, 
Naceur and Zhang (2016) have argued that the measurement fails to capture extremities of the inequality distribution (i.e. the lowest 
and highest bounds of inequality). It is therefore for the purpose of providing robust estimations that the Gini coefficient is com-
plemented with two measurements that are tailored to capture extreme ends of the inequality distribution, namely: the Atkinson index 
and the Palma ratio. The Atkinson index measures income inequality based on the percentage of total income that a specific society is 
willing to forego in order to enhance income equality among its citizens. The Palma ratio reflects national income shares of the top 10% 
of households to the bottom 40%. 
The ICT variables that are adopted align with the contemporary literature which has argued for the relevance of involving many ICT 
indicators in empirical analyses in order to provide findings with greater room for policy implications (Asongu, Amankwah-Amoah, 
Nting, & Afrifa, 2019 ; Asongu & Odhiambo, 2018 ; Efobi et al., 2018 ; Tchamyou, 2017 ). The adoption of the control variables is also 
motivated by contemporary inclusive development literature, notably: Meniago and Asongu (2018) , Tchamyou, Erreygers, and Cas-
simon (2019) and Asongu and Odhiambo (2019) . These control variables are: remittances and political stability. In the following 
passages, the expected signs from the control variables are discussed. 
First, in line Tchamyou, Asongu, et al. (2019) and Tchamyou, Erreygers, et al. (2019) and Meniago and Asongu (2018) , this 
research argues that remittances promote exclusive development in Africa because majority of the citizens from the continent going 
abroad are from wealthier segments of society. By deduction, money remitted from abroad for the most part, ends-up in richer 
households compared to poor households. By extension, as recently argued and empirically established by Asongu and Odhiambo 
(2018) , remittances promote gender exclusion in Africa. Hence, this research expects remittances to increase female unemployment 
and reduce female participation in the formal economic sector (and/or female employment). Second, while political stability is 
2 The use of the word “conditional ” is generic and not specific to the choice of authors. This is essentially because estimates from interacted 
variables are considered as “conditional effects ” in the standard literature on interactive regressions (Asongu & Odhiambo, 2020b ; Tchamyou, 
Asongu, & Odhiambo, 2019 ). Moreover, as discussed prior to stating the hypothesis, the hypothesis on the positive conditional effect builds on the 
discussed literature on the role of ICT in reducing inequality. “ICT dynamics ” represent the ICT variables used in the study, notably: mobile phone 
penetration, internet penetration and fixed broadband subscriptions.  
3 The 42 countries include: “Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burundi, Cabo Verde, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Congo 
Democratic Republic, Congo Republic, Ckote d’Ivoire, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, 
Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sao Tome & Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, 
South Africa, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda and Zambia ”. S.A. Asongu and N.M. Odhiambo                                                                                                                                                                                  Telecommunications Policy xxx (xxxx) xxx
5anticipated to promote an atmosphere that is enabling for economic prosperity, investment and associated externalities such as 
employment (i.e. including female economic participation), the overall incidence of political stability is contingent on whether it is 
negatively or positively skewed. Accordingly, a distribution of political stability that is negatively skewed may also be construed as 
political instability. It follows that the expected signs of this element in the conditioning information set cannot be established with 
certainty. It is important to clarify that the political instability indicator is negatively skewed because as shown in Appendix 2: (i) its 
mean value is negative and (ii) the minimum negative value is about as twice as high as the maximum positive value. 
This research devotes some space to clarifying why only two variables are involved in the conditioning information set. Accord -
ingly, the two control variables used in this study are in accordance with the attendant empirical literature based on the generalised 
method of moments (GMM). For instance, in order to avoid concerns about instrument proliferation that are likely to bias estimated 
coefficients, Osabuohien and Efobi (2013) and Asongu and Nwachukwu (2017) have not used any control variable. An example of a 
study that has employed two control variables (as in this study) is Bruno, De Bonis, and Silvestrini (2012). The definitions and sources 
of variables are provided in Appendix 1, whereas the summary statistics is disclosed in Appendix 2. The correlation matrix is covered 
by Appendix 3. 
3.2. Methodology 
3.2.1. GMM specification 
Borrowing from contemporary empirical literature (Asongu & Nwachukwu, 2016a; Tchamyou, 2019, 2020; Asongu & Odhiambo, 
2019c; Tchamyou et al., 2019; Fosu & Abass, 2019), this research motivates the choice of the GMM empirical strategy on four main 
justifications. (i) A prime condition for the adoption of the technique is that the number of cross sections should exceed the time 
periods pertaining to each cross section. This condition is fulfilled in our study because the research is dealing with 42 countries based 
on 11 periods in each country. (ii)The engaged measurements of gender economic participation reflect persistence because the cor-
relations between their level and first lag values are higher than the threshold of 0.800 which is the established rule of thumb for 
assessing persistence in an economic indicator (Tchamyou et al., 2019). In essence, from a preliminary analysis, the corresponding 
correlations are respectively 0.998, 0.982 and 0.999 for the female employment rate, the female unemployment rate and the female 
labour force participation rate. (iii) Given the data structure used in this research, the underlying estimation process does not eliminate 
cross-country differences because they are inherent in panel data analyses. (iv) Endogeneity is taken on board because it is controlled 
from two main angles. On the one hand, the issue of reverse causality is controlled with the employment of internal instruments. On the 
other, the unobserved heterogeneity is controlled by means of accounting for time invariant omitted variables in the estimation 
exercise. 
The extension by Roodman (2009a, 2009b) of Arellano and Bover (1995) has been established in contemporary empirical literature 
to produce more efficient estimates compared to traditional GMM approaches (Asongu & Nwachukwu, 2016b; Boateng, Asongu, 
Akamavi, & Tchamyou, 2018). Hence, the empirical approach adopted in this study is the GMM technique with forward orthogonal 
deviations.

represents the coefficient of auto-regression which is one within the framework of this study because a year lag is enough to capture 
past information, ξt is the time-specific constant, ηi is the country-specific effect and εiCt the error term. 
3.2.2. Identification and exclusion restrictions 
It will be unsound to specify a GMM technique without engaging the corresponding identification and exclusion restrictions 
properties. Such properties are relevant for a robust estimation. Within the framework of this research, following recent empirical 
literature, the “years ” are considered as strictly exogenous while the conditioning information set (i.e. control variables) and inde-
pendent variables of interest (inequality and ICT dynamics) are acknowledged to be endogenous explaining indicators (Asongu & 
Nwachukwu, 2016c ; Boateng et al., 2018 ; Tchamyou & Asongu, 2017 ; Tchamyou et al., 2019 ). The strategy of identification is 
consistent with the argument of Roodman (2009b) which maintains that years are ideal strictly exogenous variables because it is 
unlikely for years to become endogenous after a first difference.4 
Cognizant of the identification above, the assumption of exclusion restriction is assessed with the Difference in Hansen Test (DHT) 
for the exogeneity of instruments. The alternative hypothesis of this test is the position that the identified strictly exogenous variables 
do not exibit strictly exogeneity because they do not affect the outcome indicators (i.e. gender economic inclusion variables) exclu -
sively via the predetermined variables (i.e indicators in the conditioning information set and independent variables of interest). In the 
light of this narrative and clarification, the null hypothesis of the DHT should not be rejected in order for the assumptions underpinning 
the identification strategy and corresponding exclusion restrictions to be valid. Such assumptions and corresponding criteria for the 
assessment of their validity are consistent with other instrumental variable (IV) techniques which require the rejection of the alter-
native hypothesis of the Sargan/Hansen test in order for the identified instruments to influence the dependent variable exclusively 
through the exogenous components of the explaining variables (see Asongu & Nwachukwu, 2016d ; Beck, Demirgüç-Kunt, & Levine, 
2003 ). 
In the light of the above, the role of the exogenous instruments is assessed with the DHT whose null hypothesis should not be 
rejected in order for the strict exogeneity of instruments to be established. As argued by Roodman (2009a , 2009b) , the DHT test should 
be reported for the exogeneity of instruments. The attendant strictly exogenous variables adopted in this study are years because as 
argued by Roodman (2009b) , this indicator can be plausibly considered to exibit strict exogeneity because in first difference, the 
attendant indicator cannot be endogenous.5 
It is also worthwhile to articulate that four main information criteria as employed to assess the validity of the estimations, in the 
light extant GMM-centric literature: “First, the null hypothesis of the second-order Arellano and Bond autocorrelation test (AR (2)) in 
difference for the absence of autocorrelation in the residuals should not be rejected. Second the Sargan and Hansen over-identification re-
strictions (OIR) tests should not be significant because their null hypotheses are the positions that instruments are valid or not correlated with the 
error terms. In essence, while the Sargan OIR test is not robust but not weakened by instruments, the Hansen OIR is robust but weakened by 
instruments. In order to restrict identification or limit the proliferation of instruments, we have ensured that instruments are lower than the 
number of cross-sections in most specifications. Third, the Difference in Hansen Test (DHT) for exogeneity of instruments is also employed to 
assess the validity of results from the Hansen OIR test. Fourth, a Fisher test for the joint validity of estimated coefficients is also provided ” 
(Asongu & De Moor, 2017 , p. 200). 
4 Hence, the procedure for treating ivstyle (years) is ‘iv (years, eq(diff)) ’ whereas the gmmstyle is employed for predetermined variables.  
5 Discussing the test in detail implies that we reproduce most of the content of the papers of Roodman (2009a , 2009b) cited in the study. The 
interested reader can get more insights from the attendant references because engaging the test in detail may be out of scope because this is not an 
econometrics paper. What is relevant is that we: (i) discuss the relevance of the test to our study, (ii) inform the reader of the information criterion 
for the validity of the test and (iii) engage our findings in the light of this information criterion for the validity of instruments. S.A. Asongu and N.M.

104.Empirical results 
4.1. Presentation of results 
The empirical results are provided in this section in Tables 1–3. The first columns of respective tables provide the definitions of 
variables. Moreover, for the respective tables, the first row discloses the dependent variables; the second provides insights into ICT 
variables under consideration while the third shows the corresponding inequality variables. Table 1 discloses findings on linkages 
between inequality, ICT and formal economic participation. In Table 2, the results pertain to nexuses between inequality, ICT and 
female uemployment while Table 3 provides findings on linkages between inequality, ICT and female employment. The presentation of 
results in the tables is designed such that there are three types of specifications pertaining to each ICT dynamic. The first relates to 
mobile phone penetration, the second focuses on internet penetration while the last is concerned with fixed broadband subscriptions. 
In each sub-specification pertaining to an ICT dynamic, three more specifications are apparent: each focusing on one of the three 
inequality indicators (i.e. the Gini coefficient, the Atkinson index and Palma ratio, in this order). For all the engaged specifications, the 
research uses the four principal information criteria (discussed in the last paragraph of the pervious section) to assess the overall 
validity of estimated models. Based on these criteria, the models are overwhelmingly valid. 
In order to assess the overall incidence of ICT in modulating the effect of inequality on female economic participation, net impacts 
are calculated as apparent in the contemporary empirical literature (see Asongu & Odhiambo, 2019 ). For instance, in the fourth 
column of Table 1, the net impact from the role of mobile phone penetration in moderating the effect of the Palma ratio on female 
labour force participation is  0.0842 ([0.0007 �45.330] �[-0.116]). In this calculating, the mean value of mobile phone penetration 
is 45.330; the unconditional impact of the Palma ratio is  0.116 while the interactive effect between mobile phone penetration and the 
Palma ratio is 0.0007. 
The following findings can be established from Tables 1–3. There are net negative effects in the role of mobile phone penetration in 
moderating the effect of the Palma ratio on female labour force participation in Table 1. In Table 2 there are consistent net positive 
effects from the relevance of ICT in the effect of inequality on female unemployment. Only three exceptions are apparent, notably 
insignificant findings are in: (i) the role of internet penetration in moderating the effect of the Gini coefficient and Palma ratio on 
female unemployment and (ii) the relevance of fixed broadband subscriptions in moderating the impact of the Atkinson index on 
female unemployment. 
In Table 3, the significant net negative effects on female employment are apparent in: (i) the role of mobile phone penetration in 
moderating the impacts of all inequality indicators and (ii) the importance of internet penetration in dampening the unconditional 
negative effect of the Gini coefficient on female employment. The significant control variables have the expected signs. 
4.2. Extension with policy thresholds 
It is worthwhile to note that the net effects of the role of ICT in modulating inequality for enhanced female economic participation 
are consistently unfavorable, notably: (i) a net effect in Table 1 pertaining to female labour force participation is negative; (ii) six net 
impacts in Table 2 relating to female unemployment are positive and (iii) the first-four net effects in Table 3 which focuses on female 
employment are negative. Whereas these net effects are quite detrimental to the promotion of gender inclusion in the formal economic 
sector, the corresponding conditional or interactive effects overwhelmingly have signs which indicate that the unexpected net effects 
on gender economic inclusion are traceable to low ICT penetration rates. Accordingly, the positive conditional effects in Tables 1 and 3 
are indications of the fact that enhancing ICT will ultimatately nullify the corresponding negative unconditional effects and change the 
signs of the negative net effects. This explanation extends to Table 2 in which negative conditional or interactive effects are associated 
with net positive effects on female unemployment. Hence, the negative conditional effects are indications that enhancing ICT dynamics 
beyond certain thresholds can completely dampen the associated positive unconditional effects and ultimately nullify the net positive 
effects. In the light of this narrative, positive thresholds which are associated with positive conditional effects are relevant to Tables 1 
and 3 while negative thresholds related to negative conditional impacts are relevant to Table 2. The narrative on thresholds or critical 
mass is in accordance with contemporary development literature that is based on interactive regressions (Ashraf & Galor, 2013 ; Batuo, 
2015 ; Asongu, 2018 ; Asongu, le Roux and Tchamyou, 2019 ). 
Building on the above narrative, in the fourth column of Table 1, the positive threshold is 165.714 (0.116/0.0007) mobile phone 
penetration per 100 people. Hence, at this mobile phone penetration threshold, the corresponding net effect on female labour force 
participation becomes 0 ([0.0007 �165.714] �[-0.116]). Therefore, above the established threshold, mobile phone penetration 
modulates the Palma ratio to induce a positive net effect on female labour force participation. Moreover, for this policy threshold to 
make economic sense and have actionable policy relevance, it should be within the statistical range (i.e. minimum to maximum) 
disclosed in the summary statistics. Hence, the established threshold is feasible because the minimum and maximum values of mobile 
phone penetrations are respectively, 0.209 and 171.375. 
The negative policy thresholds in Table 2 pertaining to female unemployment are: (i) 87.783, 107.486 and 152.500 mobile phone 
penetration per 100 people for respectively, the Gini coefficient, the Atkinson index and the Palma ratio; (ii) 39.618 internet pene-
tration per 100 people for the Atkinson index and (iii) 4.500 fixed broadband subscritptions for the Palma ratio. These ICT policy 
thresholds pertaining to female unemployment make economic sense and have policy relevance because they are within the statistical 
ranges of ICT dynamics. As for a policy implication, ICT penetration should be enhanced by policy makers in order for ICT to 
completely nullify the positive unconditional effects of inequality dynamics on female unemployment and hence, induce overall net 
negative effects on female unemployment. S.A. Asongu and N.M. Odhiambo                                                                                                                                                                                  Telecommunications Policy xxx (xxxx) xxx
11In Table 3, positive ICT thresholds associated with female employment are: (i) 120.369, 85.533, 195 mobile phone penetration per 
100 people for respectively, the Gini coefficient, the Atkinson index and the Palma ratio and (ii) 30.005 internet penetration rate per 
100 people for the Gini coefficient. Only the 195 mobile phone penetration per 100 people threshold is not within statistical range 
because the maximum limit of mobile phone penetration in the summary statistics is 171.375 per 100 people. The remaining 
established thresholds are within statistical range and hence have policy relevance. Therefore, ICT should be enhanced above the 
established thresholds for the negative unconditional effects of inequality on female employment to be completedly dampened in order 
to ultimately induce overall positive net effects on female employment. 
5.Concluding implications and future research directions 
The study assesses how ICT modulates the effects of inequality on female economic participation in a panel of 42 countries in sub- 
Saharan Africa over the period 2004 –2014. The three inequality indicators used are: the Gini coefficient, the Atkinson index and the 
Palma ratio while the adopted ICT indicators are mobile phone penetration, internet penetration and fixed broadband subscriptions. 
Three gender economic inclusion indicators are also used for the analysis, namely: female labour force participation, female unem -
ployment and female employment. The Generalised Method of Moments is used for the empirical analysis. 
The findings overwhelmingly show unexpected net effects, notably: positive net impacts on female unemployment and negative net 
effects on female employment and female labour force participation. Fortunately, the corresponding conditional or interaction effects 
are favourable and indicate that enhancing ICT beyond given thresholds can nullify the unfavorable unconditional effects of inequality 
on gender economic inclusion in order to change the signs of established net effects. Hence, with the established ICT thresholds, further 
enhancing ICT has an overall effect in modulating inequality dynamics to reduce female unemployment and increase female 
employment and female labour force participation. First, for female labour force participation, a minimum threshold of 165.714 
mobile phone penetration per 100 people is required for the Palma ratio. Second, minimum ICT thresholds for the reduction of female 
unemployment are: (i) 87.783, 107.486 and 152.500 mobile phone penetration per 100 people for respectively, the Gini coefficient, 
the Atkinson index and the Palma ratio; (ii) 39.618 internet penetration per 100 people for the Atkinson index and (iii) 4.500 fixed 
broadband subscritptions for the Palma ratio. Third, the corresponding ICT thresholds for the promotion of female employment are: (i) 
120.369 and 85.533 mobile phone penetration for respectively, the Gini coefficient and the Atkinson index and (ii) 30.005 internet 
penetration per 100 people for the Gini coefficient. The established thresholds make economic sense and can be feasibly implemented 
by policy makers in order to induce favourable effects on gender economic inclusion because they are within the statistical ranges 
disclosed in the summary statistics. 
Overall from the findings, it can be concluded that ICT penetration needs to be enhanced in order to effectively mitigate inequality 
for the enhancement of the participation of women in the formal economic sector. The need to enhance ICT may also be traceable to the 
high inequality level prevailing in the sampled countries. Hence, a policy framework of promoting ICT could be accompanied by 
corresponding policies designed to reduce inequality. With such complementary policy actions, the ICT penetration thresholds may not 
be as high as established. Ceteris paribus, the established ICT thresholds are based on the fact that: (i) inequality levels remain un-
changed and (ii) in the light of the unconditional effects of inequality dynamics on gender inclusion variables, inequality should be 
reduced concurrently with the enhancement of ICT, especially when/if financial resources needed to enhance ICT to certain critical 
masses are more than the corresponding funds relevant for reducing inequality. 
Future studies should engage relevant estimation techniques in order to assess if the established findings in this study withstand 
empirical scrutiny when the problem statement is viewed from country-specific settings. The policy recommendation is motivated by 
the caveat that cross-specific effects are eliminated in the panel regressions as it is required in GMM specifications in order to avoid 
endogeneity resulting from the correlation between country-specific effects and the lagged dependent variable. Moreover, in the 
suggested future research directions, considering alternative ICT indicators from the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) is 
also worthwhile. This consideration should clearly separate the effects of “active mobile-broadband subscriptions ” from those of “fixed 
broadband subscriptions ” used in this study.
