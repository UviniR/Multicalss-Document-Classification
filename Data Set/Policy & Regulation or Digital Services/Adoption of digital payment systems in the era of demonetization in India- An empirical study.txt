Abstract
Purpose –This study aims to investigate the actual usage (AU) of digital payment systems by the
consumers during the period of demonetization (from November 9, 2016 to December 30, 2016) in India.
Design/methodology/approach –The conceptual frame work for this study is based on the uni ﬁed
theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT 2) and innovation resistance theory. A total of 766
sample respondents were surveyed using a pre-tested questionnaire. The empirical validation of the
framework and analysis was done using partial least squares (PLS)-structural equation modeling (SEM)technique.
Findings –The results suggest that the behavioral intention (BI) to use and innovation resistance (IR) affect
the usage of digital payment systems. The relation between BI to use digital payment systems and the AU of
digital payment systems is moderated by the stickiness to cash payments.
Research limitations/implications –This cross-sectional study is limited by geographic constraints
and highlights the AU of digital payment systems by using the UTAUT 2 and IR theory only during thedemonetization period.
Practical implications –This study offers valuable insights to the economists, policymakers and digital
payment service providers regarding the usage of digital payment systems by consumers during
demonetization.
Originality/value –This study assumes importance as it empirically examines the in ﬂuence of BI and IR
on the AU of digital payment systems during the demonetization period in India. This study empiricallyvalidates the moderating in ﬂuence of stickiness to cash payments on the AU of digital payment systems.

1. Introduction
The Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on November 8, 2016 regarding the
demonetization, mentioning that 500 and 1,000 rupee currency notes in circulation will notbe legal anymore. The Government of India (GoI) directed the Indian citizens to deposit the
old denomination notes of 500 and 1,000 rupees in their bank accounts and exchange them
for new currency notes. GoI issued new currency notes of 2,000 rupees to avoid the cashcrunch. This unexpected demonetization move, which happened earlier in 1946 and 1978,took everyone by surprise, as it occurred for the third time in the Indian economy ( PWC,
2016).
The Indian economy is largely based on cash based transactions. As per the Reserve
Bank of India, 86 per cent of the Indian bank notes are in 500 and 1,000 rupeesdenominations ( RBI Annual Report, 2016 ). Though 2,000 rupees currency notes wereAdoption of

introduced by GoI to replace the old notes, still the economy witnessed a massive cash
crunch. There were long queues in front of the banks, and automated teller machines
(ATMs) were closed as the supply of cash was limited. One of the important solutions to this
problem is the alternate modes of digital payment systems. GoI noti ﬁed the citizens
regarding the introduction of cash withdrawal limits. Scarcity of cash fueled faster adoptionof alternate methods of digital payment systems.
As per the Indian Payment and Settlement Act 2007, digital payments are de ﬁned as
electronic fund transfers. When an individual initiates the transfer of funds through anelectronic medium by means of authorization or bank instructions to credit or debit an
account maintained with that bank, it is ca lled as digital payment system. It also
comprises ATM transactions, transfer through telephone, point of sale transfer, internet
and card payments along with direct deposits or withdrawal of funds. Hence, the digitalpayment systems are dependent upon the diffe rent technologies which are as discussed
inTable I .
Demonetization triggered millions of citizens to shift and embrace digital payment
systems. According to Nielsen Report Part II (2016) , post the demonetization announcement,
there was a windfall for digital payment system providers like digital wallets. A major
chunk was driven by aggressive advertising along with swift adoption by small business
ﬁrms. There was a quick adoption of digital payment systems by restaurants, cafes, small
vendors, auto-rickshaw drivers and small shops (Kiranas). GoI also provided incentives onusing digital payment systems to progress the pace of adoption. There are many advantagesof digital payment systems –easy and convenient, pay and send anywhere, discount from
taxes, written records easily maintained and less risky. There is also a dark side to digital

payment systems, which citizens faced –difﬁculty for non-technical persons to comprehend,
risk of spending and risk of data theft.
As per UPI Payments Website (2016) , India had seen a remarkable growth in mobile
banking transactions in 2015-2016, which were Rs 4,018bn in total as compared to Rs 60bn
in 2012-2013. The GoI also supported digital payments by announcing incentives andreducing taxes to trigger movement toward a cashless society.
After studying the challenges and bene ﬁts of using digital payment systems, the
knowledge of the various factors in ﬂuencing the adoption from the citizen ’s perspective is
crucial for developing countries and emerging markets like India to understand. During the
demonetization era, the GoI had invested large amount resources for the development anddeployment of digital payment systems for its citizens; however, the success is ultimately
dependent on the user ’s adoption and acceptance. The research deals with this gap by
investigating the adoption of digital payment systems, which were at its nascent stage,during the era of demonetization. The research question is hence formulated as:
RQ1. What is the prevalent situation in India regarding the adoption of digital payment
systems during the period of demonetization and what are the implications for the
future of digital payment systems?
The above research question was answered by using the technology adoption uni ﬁed theory
of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT 2) model and innovation resistance theory(IRT). By conducting a primary survey, the empirical ﬁndings of this survey were analyzed,
and their implications to adoption, resistance and actual usage (AU) of digital payment
systems in India are discussed. This research focuses on the adoption, resistance and AU ofdigital payment systems by the citizens in the era of demonetization. The results can be usedGoI, policymakers and digital payment system service providers to formulate strategies for
improving the acceptance and adoption of digital payment systems.
The previous technology adoption studies are in ﬂuenced by various technology
acceptance models (TAMs) and theories such as social cognitive theory, innovationdiffusion theory (IDT) and TAM. Though the above theories were useful in explainingadoption of different information technologies, however, those theories have explained
adoption based on system perceptions, mainly behavioral and attitudinal link ( Venkatesh
et al., 2012 ). These theories were mainly criticized because of their incapability to broadly
describe the essentials of task technology environment ( Benbasat and Barki, 2007 ). To
surmount the criticism of previous theories, the UTAUT was developed ( Venkatesh et al.,
2003). The UTAUT model is suggestive to information technology-based perception of the
TAM ( Venkatesh et al., 2003 ), and to overcome the criticism of previous theories, UTAUT
was further modi ﬁed by including more contextual factors such as habit and price value
(PV) to form the UTAUT 2 ( Venkatesh et al., 2012 ). UTAUT 2 model was validated by many
empirical studies in different disciplines and task environments ( Kim et al., 2008 ;Liet al.,
2011). To conduct this research on the adoption and acceptance of digital payment systems,
the UTAUT 2 model is considered.
The earlier literature of innovation diffusion has experienced the pro-change bias ( Ram,
1987;Sheth, 1981 ;Rogers, 2003 ). It was considered that all innovations should be adopted, as
they were always good for everyone ( Rogers, 2003 ). It was examined by Sheth (1981) that
consumers do not have the desire to change and argued to concentrate on innovation
resistance (IR) rather than on reasons for adoption. He studied the IR psychology of the
consumers and argued that habit toward existing behavior and perceived risk of adoption ofinnovation are important constructs of IR. Further, Ram and Sheth (1989) developed
functional and psychological barriers to innovation adoption. The functional barriers wereAdoption of

divided into usage, value and risk barriers (RB), and psychological barriers were divided
into tradition and image barriers (IB). With this work of Ram and Sheth (1989) , the theory of
adoption is linked with the theory of IR. So this study considers the IRT with reference toRam and Sheth (1989) to understand the IR to adoption of digital payment systems during
the demonetization period in India.
2. Underpinning theories
The objective of this research is to examine the behavioral intention (BI) and AU of the
digital payment systems with respect to the Indian citizens at the time of demonetization.The term digital payment system means the type of payment which is done through the
digital mode. In digital payments, hard cash is not involved, as both payee and payer use
digital mode to complete the transaction and receipt of payment. This is a new trend,triggering a paradigm shift in India ’s economic culture, and hence, consumer acceptance
needs to be studied. This research uses the UTAUT 2 model to study the consumer adoptionof digital payment systems and IRT to map the apprehensions of the consumers. This study
integrates the UTAUT 2 and IRT as the single integrated framework to study and ﬁnd out
the solution to the research question.
2.1 Uni ﬁed theory of acceptance and use of technology 2
Acceptance of digital or IT is the most discussed area of research. There are many
competing models with different determinants for explaining TAM. After an extensiveresearch of previous studies regarding the technology adoption models, it has been foundthat the UTAUT model ( Venkatesh et al., 2003 ) is the contemporary model, and it has four
constructs: performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), social in ﬂuence (SI) and
facilitating conditions (FC). Many prior studies have con ﬁrmed that the UTAUT model has
been mainly utilized for technology adoption research in the domains of e-banking,e-learning, e-commerce and e-government ( Jain, 2016 ).
The UTAUT model is tested and used in many previous studies. The UTAUT model
was con ﬁrmed as a comprehensive model for acceptance and use of technology; however, it
has some constraints ( Negahban and Chung, 2014 ). Considering the UTAUT model
limitations, the UTAUT 2 model was developed by Venkatesh et al.( 2 0 1 2 ) which has a
detailed framework and includes seven constructs –PE, EE, SI, FC, hedonic motivation
(HM), PV and habit (HA). The UTAUT 2 ( Venkatesh et al., 2012 ) model was tested with
reference to earlier studies on mobile payment adoption ( Slade et al., 2014 ;Dahlberg et al.,
2015;Baptista and Oliveira, 2017 ;Morosan and DeFranco, 2016 ). Hence, this study considers
the UTAUT 2 model for understanding adoption and usage of digital payment systems.
UTAUT 2 is considered with six constructs: PE, EE, SI, FC, HM and HA, to discuss the
BI to use the digital payment systems. The PV construct is not considered in this study, asthe transactions using the digital payment systems during the demonetization period werefree because of GoI incentives.
2.2 Innovation resistance theory
The digital payment systems are innovative and also involve technology. Innovation
acceptance is challenging not only for organizations but also for individuals. Most of thecommercial companies develop innovative products which are consumer centric and makeconscious efforts for consumer adoption. Still companies are facing failure in innovationacceptance by consumers ( Danneels, 2003 ;Moore, 2002 ). Before the adoption or the eventual
rejection decision by the consumers, they exhibit some resistance ( Kuisma et al., 2007 ).
However, resistance and adoption of an innovation can also coexist ( Ram, 1987 ). It is theJSTPM
Downloaded by La Trobe University At 09:19 06 January 2018 (PT)
conscious choice of a consumer to resist the innovation offered by the companies ( Szmigin
and Foxall, 1998 ).
The meaning of IR is the resistance by the consumers due to possible changes in
current satisfactory state or difference from their idea of innovation ( Ram and Sheth,
1989 ). The problem with innovation acceptance is that consumers are not easily ready
for trying the innovation ( Ram and Sheth, 1989 ;Nabih et al., 1997 ;Szmigin and Foxall,
1998 ). However, IR is mainly resistance to innovation or not accepting the innovation
easily. The IRT is tailored from the IDT ( Rogers, 2003 ) and the psychology that
discusses the reasons of IR, though innovations are considered to be desirable andnecessary. The constructs of IRT consists of d imensions such as RB, value barrier (VB),
usage barrier (UB), IB and traditional barrier (TB) ( Ram and Sheth, 1989 ;Laukkanen
et al., 2007 ). Resistance to innovation by consumers can be in three incremental stages
such as postponement of innovation, rejection to innovation or opposition toinnovation.
During the period of demonetization, thou gh citizens faced cash crunch, adoption of
digital payment systems was still a challenge due to involvement of technology and
existence of different digital payment systems such as USSD, IMPS, NEFT, RTGS, PPI,
UPI, mobile banking, mobile wallets, AEP S, BHIM app, Credit Card and Debit Card.
Adoption of technology in today ’s era is dependent on social opinions; it is no more the
choice of individual. With reference to this, study of behavior intention ( Miltgen et al.,
2013 ) is also an important variable to be considered.
3. Research objective
The study focuses on AU of digital payment systems during the demonetization period. It
has the following objectives:
/C15to develop a theoretical model linking BI to use, IRT and AU of digital paymentsystems; and
/C15to empirically validate the theoretical framework.
4. Theoretical background and hypotheses development
The integration of UTAUT 2 and IRT is used to support the theoretical model. The UTAUT
model was used as it was a good predictor of acceptance of information technology ( Martins
et al., 2014 ) till the UTAUT 2 model was discussed ( Venkatesh et al., 2012 ). The UTAUT 2
model is considered in this study, as it is more explanatory compared to earlier models topredict the BI and use of technology.
There are many innovations adopted by the consumers. There were also cases where
some innovations have faced failure in acceptance by the consumers ( Danneels, 2003 ;Moore,
2002), as resisting the innovation is the consumer ’s conscious decision ( Szmigin and Foxall,
1998). In consideration with the consumer ’s resistance to innovation, this study integrates
the IRT with the UTAUT 2 model to study the adoption and resistance of innovation for thedigital payment systems.
During the period of demonetization, it has been observed that consumers were
confused and anxious. There were long queues in front of banks and ATMs towithdraw cash and deposit old notes. Consumers were not much aware of digitalpayment systems, and they had a number of apprehensions about it. Keeping this inmind, the IRT was used in the theoretical model to understand the determinants of
resistance ( Figure 1 ).Adoption of

4.1 Hypotheses development
4.1.1 Relationship between performance expectancy and behavioral intention to use digitalpayment systems. PE is the extent of an individual ’s belief that using the technology will be
useful to increase the job performance ( Venkatesh et al., 2003 ). With reference to mobile
banking, PE is the bene ﬁt that the consumer gets such as economic bene ﬁts, personal image,
satisfaction and convenience (Taylor and Tood, 1995a, 1995b; Rogers, 1995 ). PE is one of the
vital factors which directly impacts BI to use mobile banking ( Luoet al., 2010 ;Hongxia et al.,
2011;Wang and Yi, 2012 ;Yu, 2012 ;Oliveira et al., 2014 ). PE is strongly associated with BI to
use internet banking ( Tarhini et al., 2016 ):
H1. PE positively in ﬂuences BI to use digital payment systems
4.1.2 Relationship between e ﬀort expectancy and behavioral intention to use digital payment
systems. EE is de ﬁned as the ease of use which the customers experience while using the
technology ( Venkatesh et al., 2003 ), and it impacts the customer ’s BI to use technology
(Venkatesh et al., 2012 ). Earlier literature con ﬁrms that cognitive efforts required for
learning and using the information technology impacts the BI to use technology during the
initial phase of use of technology ( Gefen, 2003 ;Venkatesh and Davis, 2000 ). When customers
are at ease while using mobile banking, it increases their expectations for expectedperformance ( Zhou et al., 2010 ;Hongxia et al., 2011 ;Thakur, 2013 ;Mohammadi, 2015 ;
Koksal, 2016 ;Martins et al., 2014 ), con ﬁrming the signi ﬁcant positive association between
EE and BI to use internet banking. It is clear that if there is less effort required, the customerFigure 1.

will surely have intention to use any kind of technology. So, the below hypothesis was
formed:
H2. EE positively in ﬂuences BI to use digital payment systems.
4.1.3 Relationship between social in ﬂuence and behavioral intention to use digital payment
systems. SI means the perception of the consumer regarding the belief of friends, family
members and other consumers toward the use of technology ( Venkatesh et al., 2003 ,2012).
Consumers develop favorable image toward the use of technology when they build up thebelief that they can gain social status and image in their reference groups ( Venkatesh and
Morris, 2000 ;Venkatesh and Davis, 2000 ). SI has an impact toward BI to use mobile
technology ( Sreenivasan and Noor, 2010 ) and mobile payment and banking ( Püschel et al.,
2010;Hongxia et al., 2011 ;Yang et al., 2012 ) SI has strong association with BI for use of
technology ( Tarhini et al., 2014 ;Venkatesh and Zhang, 2010 ):
H3. SI positively in ﬂuences BI to use digital payment systems.
4.1.4 Relationship between facilitating conditions and behavioral intention. Facilitating
comprises software resources, hardware, technical support and knowledge of informationtechnology ( Taylor and Todd ,1995a, 1995b ). When it comes to use of any technology, the FC
are guidance, help and training provided to use. As per Venkatesh et al. (2012) , FC means the
perception of the consumer toward the support and resources available to conduct behavior.
Consumers adopt the use of electronic banking transactions when they are easily able to
access and use internet and computer ( Joshua and Koshy, 2011 ). FC has a positive
association with intention to use mobile communication technology ( Park et al., 2007 ) and
mobile payment ( Zhou et al., 2010 ;Yu, 2012 )
H4. FC positively in ﬂuences BI to use digital payment systems.
4.1.5 Relationship between hedonic motivation and behavioral intention. HM means the
enjoyment, fun and pleasure a consumer derives by the use of technology, and it alsocontributes to BI to use technology ( Venkatesh et al., 2012 ). Consumers enjoy using
technology when technology is fun and pleasurable to use ( Lee, 2009 ;Leong et al., 2013 ). The
association between HM and BI to use information systems is con ﬁrmed (
Kim et al., 2008 ).
Thus, following hypothesis was formed:
H5. HM positively in ﬂuences BI to use digital payment systems.
4.1.6 Relationship between habit and behavioral intention. Habit is discussed as consumer ’s
repeated behavior due to learning ( Venkatesh et al., 2012 ). The study of Nikou and Bouwman
(2014) suggests that habit in ﬂuences the use of mobile social netw orking sites. Earlier research
conceptualizes that habit is separate from behavior ( Khalifa and Liu, 2007 ). Prior research
conﬁrms that habit contributes to BI to use Information technology ( Lankton et al., 2010 ;Aarts
and Dijksterhuis, 2000 ). It was also found that habit has an impact on BI to use mobile payment
(Dahlberg and Oorni, 2007 ). Considering this, the following hypothesis was formed:
H6. Habit positively in ﬂuences BI to use digital payment systems.
4.1.7 Relationship between usage barrier and innovation resistance. When any new
innovation is not well-matched with current systems, habits and practices, consumers resistthe innovation, and it is called as UB ( Ram and Sheth, 1989 ). Previous studies con ﬁrmed the
existence of resistance by consumers with regards to banking technology and suggestcustomer education ( Laukkanen et al., 2009 ). The UB is mainly due to the usability of anAdoption of

innovation. UB affects the IR of consumers to use digital payment systems; so, the following
hypothesis was formed:
H7. UB positively in ﬂuences the IR to use digital payment systems.
4.1.8 Relationship between value barrier and innovation resistance. The value brought by
the innovation with regards to the monetary value and performance is considered as the VB
(Ram and Sheth, 1989 ). The consumer ’s opinion toward the innovation that it adds value to
their performance is considered as VB ( Davis et al., 1989 ). Sometimes innovations fail to
provide better performance as compared to the substitutes available; so, consumers do not
ﬁnd value in the new innovation ( Ram and Sheth, 1989 ). Sometimes consumers also perceive
that online banking does not provide the services and functions which previous services inbanking were offered by banks ( Fain and Roberts, 1997 ). Hence, the following hypothesis
was formed.
H8. VB positively in ﬂuences IR to use digital payment systems.
4.1.9 Relationship between risk barrier and innovation resistance. The degree of risk
involved in an innovation is considered as RB ( Ram and Sheth, 1989 ), and risk may be
related to causing damage to individual or his property. With reference to onlinetransactions, the perceived risk by the consumer is risk associated with psychological,
ﬁnancial, social or physical risk ( Forsythe and Shi, 2003 ). In mobile banking and internet
banking, PIN codes may create the risk, and also, there are crucial security and privacyconcerns ( Kuisma et al., 2007 ;Luarn and Lin, 2005 ;Thakur and Srivastava, 2014 ). Some
customers feel insecure that their PIN numbers will be hacked by hackers ( Poon, 2008 ;
Laukkanen and Lauronen, 2005 ). There is risk perceived by the consumers with any type of
digital payment systems. When it comes to perceived security with reference to internetbanking the main concern is con ﬁdentiality ( Liao and Cheung, 2002 ). In consideration with
above, the below hypothesis was formed:
H9. RB positively in ﬂuences IR to use digital payment systems.
4.1.10 Relationship between traditional barrier and innovation resistance. Consumers tend
to show barriers due to norms, traditions and any kind behavior that contradicts the family,society or group norms ( Herbig and Day, 1992 ).Ram and Sheth (1989) suggested that
societal disapproval leads to IR. TB may occur as consumers are not familiar of paying bills
using electronic medium ( Fain and Roberts, 1997 ). So, they may prefer to deal with bank
clerks rather than paying bills through electronic medium ( Forman and Sriram, 1991 ). The
previous research con ﬁrms the relationship between TB and IR ( Kleijnen et al., 2009 ). The
following hypothesis is formed:
H10. TB positively in ﬂuences IR to use digital payment systems.
4.1.11 Relationship between image barrier and innovation resistance. It is dif ﬁcult to
observe the product functioning or characteristics of an innovation. The images generallyresult from the different types of information, rumors and stereotypes ( Ram and Sheth,
1989). As per Fortin and Renton (2003)
the negative perception of the image of innovation
may occur due to negative media coverage ( Ram, 1989 ), which results in resistance. As
suggested by Fain and Roberts (1997) , the image of electronic and mobile services is
considered negative and hard to use. Consumers perceive that technology is dif ﬁcult to use,
so it has a negative image:
H11. IB positively in ﬂuences IR to use digital payment systems.JSTPM

4.1.12 Relationship between behavioral intention and actual usage of digital payment
systems. BI suggests the individual willingness to perform a particular behavior and BI is an
antecedent of usage behavior. As per Ajzen (1991) , the usage or AU behavior noticeable, is
the evident response in a provided situation with regards to the given target. The previousinformation technology acceptance studies discuss the positive relationship between BI andAU of information technology ( Venkatesh and Zhang, 2010 ;Venkatesh et al., 2003 ,2012;
Tarhini et al., 2013 ,2016):
H12. BI to use digital payment systems positively in ﬂuences AU of digital payment
systems.
4.1.13 Relationship between innovation resistance and actual usage of digital payment
system. The negative response of the consumer dependent on the conscious choice is called
as IR ( Szmigin and Foxall, 1998 ). When it comes to innovation adoption and usage, it is
found that consumers often implicitly develop a consolidated image with relational bene ﬁts
(Rogers, 2003 ). Most of the research regarding innovation adoption provides emphasis on
the advantage of innovation as a key driver to consumer adoption and usage. However,there are many evidences discussed regarding the resistance to innovation ( Molesworth and
Suortti, 2002 ;Garcia and Atkin, 2002 ). Companies try to create consumer centric innovation
to value add to the consumer, but many companies still experienced innovation failure(Danneels, 2003 ;Moore 2002 ). With this, the below hypothesis was formed:
H13. IR to digital payment systems negatively in ﬂuences the AU of digital payment
system.
4.1.14 Moderation relationship of consumer stickiness to cash payment between behavioral
intention to use and actual usage of digital payment systems. The stickiness is de ﬁned as the
capability of any website to capture and retain the user attention ( Demers and Lev, 2001 ;
Maciag, 2000 ). It discussed that stickiness is the intangible ability which provoke customers
to visit frequently and for longer period of time. With reference to this research, digitalpayment systems are new; so, stickiness is considered for using the cash payment. As per
Hsu and Lin (2016) stickiness signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuences a user ’s intention to purchase in-app
for mobile banking. With regards to e-commerce, the user ’s stickiness to website is in strong
association with her/his intention to transaction ( Lin, 2007 ). In consideration with the above,
the following hypothesis was formed:
H14. Consumer stickiness to cash payment moderates the relationship between
behavior intention and AU of digital payment systems.
5. Research methodology
5.1 Measures
The literature review was conducted regarding the UTAUT 2 model and IRT to study the
consumer resistance, BI to use and AU of digital payment systems to prepare the surveyinstrument. The research conducted the survey using the following measures to test thehypotheses.
5.2 Research instrument design
This study used the research instrument from the previous studies conducted with reference
to the acceptance of technology and modi ﬁed for the subject of digital payment systems.
The study has mainly adopted the items from previous studies ( Venkatesh et al., 2012 ;ZhouAdoption of
digital
payment
systems
Downloaded by La Trobe University At 09:19 06 January 2018 (PT)
et al., 2010 ;Laukkanen et al., 2007 ;Ram and Sheth, 1989 ) regarding the UTAUT 2 model and
IRT. As per Fornell and Larcker (1981) , it is imperative to establish the validity of the
constructs and reliability of the scale; so, this study veri ﬁed the scale for each of above
constructs.
Prior to the data collection process, to establish face validity, ﬁve subject matter experts
were identi ﬁed and exposed to the overall scope and objectives of the study. After
incorporating the suggestion and feedback regarding the suitability of all constructs, thequestionnaire for the pre-test was ﬁnalized. To measure the constructs operationalized in
this study, a ﬁve-point Likert scale was used. To assess the research instrument ’s validity
and reliability, a pre-test and pilot test was conducted. A total of 30 questionnaires weredistributed for the pre-test among the target respondents. As per their feedback, the
questionnaires were modi ﬁed to ensure that all the questions were well understood and easy
to follow. To evaluate the reliability and internal consistency of the data, Cronbach ’s alpha
was used. The researcher carried out a pilot test ( N= 150), and the data were analyzed using
partial least squares (PLS)-structural equation modeling (SEM). The main data collectionwas carried out after satisfactory results were obtained in the pilot test (The data set from
the pre-test and pilot-test were not included in the ﬁnal data analysis). The operationalized
constructs used in this study are as shown in Table II .
5.3 Sampling and data collection
The PLS path modeling technique has the bene ﬁt that it is not affected by small sample size.
To ascertain the adequate sample size required for this study the thumb rule ( Gefen et al.,
2000) was considered. For assessing the required sample size, ten times the number of items
of the biggest construct in the research model was used. Hence, the required sample size for
this study is 240 respondents. The primary data collection was done using a structured
questionnaire ( Table II ) which was administered to the respondents. The target respondents
selected for this study were consumers using any form of digital payment systems during
the demonetization period using the convenience sampling method in Pune city and its
suburbs. The respondents included people in restaurants, cafes, markets, bus stands,
railway stations, airport, shopping malls, auto rickshaw and cab drivers, small vendors,
shopkeepers, rickshaw pullers, handcart vendors, retail store owners, house wives, students,working professionals, contract workers along with the common citizens and consumers.
During the demonetization period, every consumer was affected to a certain extent and
triggered to migrate and embrace some form of digital payment system; so, the respondentchosen for this study were appropriate.
5.4 Non-response bias
In survey methods, non-response bias is considered a serious concern, as it limits the
generalization of the ﬁndings ( Michie and Marteau, 1999 ). Hence, it needs to be addressed by
the researchers ( Lewis et al., 2013 ). When the response of the individuals to a survey differs
systematically from those who were invited to participate but did not respond, it results in
response bias ( Menachemi, 2010 ). Hence, appropriate steps were taken by the researcher to
ensure that non-response is not an issue for this study. This was done by dividing the data
into two data sets (early respondents vs late respondents) by performing the wave analysis.
The comparison of the early and late wave responses was done to test for non-response bias(Armstrong and Overton, 1977 ). The t-test analysis showed no signi ﬁcant differences ( p=
0.49) between the early wave (410) and late wave (356) groups, indicating that non-response
bias does not affect this study. Finally, 766 responses were found ﬁt for analysis in all
respects.JSTPM

5.5 Common method bias
A survey-based method for data collection was used to test the research hypothesis in this
work. When the response data are collected from multiple sources, it may suffer from the
risk of presence of common method bias ( Mackenzie and Podsakoff, 2012 ;Podsakoff et al.,
2003;Podsakoff and Organ, 1986 ). The researcher conducted the single factor Harman test
(Podsakoff and Organ, 1986 ) to examine the occurrence of common method bias in this
work. On performing the analysis of the research framework, the results from this test showthat 14.43 per cent of the variance is explained by a single factor which is less than 50
per cent. This proves that common method bias is not a concern in this research.
With reference to the above criteria, there are suf ﬁcient evidences of validity and
reliability in the measures of this study.
5.6 PLS-SEM
As the PLS-SEM path modeling technique has the capability to represent the latent variableconstructs in this work, it is used to test the conceptual research framework and assess thecausal relationship between the indicators and latent constructs ( Gudergan et al., 2008 ).
When the objective of the research is to extend the existing theory ( Hair et al., 2011 ), PLS-
SEM is preferred over maximum likelihood, as it is a ﬂexible technique to model the
research constructs ( Henseler, 2010 ). So, the smart PLS software ( Ringle et al., 2005 ) was
used for data analysis.
6. Results
The demographic pro ﬁle of the respondents is shown in Table III .
6.1 Measurement model
The multi-item re ﬂective constructs in the hypothesized framework was used to calculate
the measurement properties in the ﬁnal measurement model. The indicator ’s factor loadings
were more than 0.5 ( Hair et al., 2006 ). The reliability of the measure was established as the
Cronbach ’s alpha for all the constructs were more than 0.7. This shows high internal
consistency of all the research constructs used ( Nunnally, 1978 ).
The outer item loadings and composite reliability (CR) was checked to evaluate the
reﬂective measurement items. To check the convergent validity, the average variance
extracted (AVE) was calculated. The outer loadings for all the items were more than theMain

minimum threshold value of 0.6, and all the research constructs show high levels of internal
consistency/reliability shown by the CR values as displayed in Table IV . The convergent
validity for all the constructs are con ﬁrmed as the AVE values are more than the minimum
threshold value of 0.5 ( Hair et al., 2006 ).
The assessment of the discriminant validity of the research constructs was done using
theFornell and Larcker (1981) criterion. The discriminant validity of the constructs is
veriﬁed by the off-diagonal values in Table V showing the correlation between the latent
constructs. The comparison of the construct inter-correlations with AVE was done to prove
the discriminant validity as shown in Table V . Discriminant validity was ascertained as the
shared variance values were less than the corresponding AVE ( Fornell and Larcker, 1981 ).
Hence, discriminant validity between the research constructs is veri ﬁed.
6.2 Structural model
After the evaluation of the measurement model, it was found to be reliable and valid. Hence,
the path analysis was carried out to assess the structural model relationships among theconstructs using PLS-SEM by calculating the path coef ﬁcients and its signi ﬁcance. ItTable III.

H1tested whether BI to use digital payment systems is explained by PE. As per the
results of the path analysis, PE (path coef ﬁcient = 0.293, t-statistics = 3.321) signi ﬁcantly
predicts BI to use to use digital payment systems. Hence, the H1was supported, and it is in
line with previous studies ( Hongxia et al., 2011 ;Wang and Yi, 2012 ;Yu, 2012 ) on mobile
payment. This result implies that during demonetization, due to the non-availability of cash,
digital payment systems offered convenience and performance bene ﬁts to the consumers to
perform their daily ﬁnancial transactions.
H2tested whether BI to use digital payment systems is explained by EE. As per the
results of the path analysis, EE (path coef ﬁcient = 0.320, t-statistics = 4.756) signi ﬁcantly
predicts BI to use to use digital payment systems. Hence, the H2was supported, and it also
conﬁrms the extant literature ( Zhou et al., 2010 ;Hongxia et al., 2011 ;Thakur, 2013 ;
Mohammadi, 2015 ;Koksal, 2016 ;Martins et al ., 2014 ). This implied that during
demonetization, less effort was required by the consumers to use digital payment systems
rather than standing in long queues outside the banks and ATMs.
H3tested whether BI to use digital payment systems is explained by SI. As per the
results of the path analysis, SI (path coef ﬁcient = 0.329, t-statistics = 5.004) signi ﬁcantly
predicts BI to use to use digital payment systems. Hence, the H3was supported and
conﬁrms the previous studies ( Tarhini et al., 2014 ;Venkatesh and Zhang, 2010 ;Püschel
et al., 2010 ;Hongxia et al., 2011 ;Yang et al., 2012 ). The result indicated that SI of family
members, friends and other consumers during demonetization period triggered the BI to use
digital payment systems.
H4tested whether BI to use digital payment systems is explained by FC. As per the
results of the path analysis, FC (path coef ﬁcient = 0.303, t-statistics = 3.917) signi ﬁcantly
predicts BI to use to use digital payment systems. Hence, the H4was supported and aligns
with the studies conducted on mobile payment adoption ( Zhou et al., 2010 ;Yu, 2012 ). The

demonetization period, consumers experienced UB which in ﬂuenced the IR to digital
payment systems.
H8tested whether IR to digital payment systems is explained by VB. As per the results
of the path analysis, VB (path coef ﬁcient = 0.322, t-statistics = 3.668) signi ﬁcantly predicts
IR to digital payment systems. Hence, the H8was supported. The transactions using digital
payment systems during demonetization period were free due to the Indian government
initiatives. However, the consumers were aware that post-demonetization period, digital
transactions would be charged as the incentives would be withdrawn by the Indian
government. This led to the VB to AU of digital payment systems.
H9tested whether IR to digital payment systems is explained by RB. As per the results
of the path analysis, RB (path coef ﬁcient = 0.364, t-statistics = 5.158) signi ﬁcantly predicts
IR to digital payment systems. Hence, the H9was supported. The result implies that during
demonetization period, consumers had security, privacy and con ﬁdentiality concerns during
the use of digital payment systems.
H10 tested whether IR to digital payment systems is explained by TB. As per the results
of the path analysis, TB (path coef ﬁcient = 0.168, t-statistics = 2.046) signi ﬁcantly predicts
IR to digital payment systems. Hence, the H10 was supported. The result implies that theFigure 2.

tradition of the consumer to use cash is deep rooted in the psyche and ethos of the Indian
culture, which acts as TB and offers IR to use digital payment systems.
H11 tested whether IR to digital payment systems is explained by IB. As per the results
of the path analysis, IB (path coef ﬁcient = 0.239, t-statistics = 2.245) signi ﬁcantly predicts IR
to digital payment systems. Hence, the H11 was supported. The result show that lack of a
positive image among the consumers due to loss of anonymity and presence of a digital trailof disclosure of all transactions with service providers, act as IB and offers IR to use digital
payment systems
H12 tested whether AU of digital payment systems is explained by BI. As per the results
of the path analysis, BI (path coef ﬁcient = 0.571, t-statistics = 3.951) signi ﬁcantly predicts
AU of digital payment systems. Hence, the H12 was supported, and it is con ﬁrms with
extant studies ( Venkatesh and Zhang, 2010 ;Venkatesh et al., 2003 ,2012;Tarhini et al., 2013 ,
2016). During demonetization, BI to use digital payment systems among consumers
inﬂuenced the AU of digital payment systems.
H13 tested whether AU of digital payment systems is explained by IR. As per the results
of the path analysis, IR (path coef ﬁcient = /C00.114, t-statistics = 2.038) signi ﬁcantly predicts
AU of digital payment systems. Hence, the H13 was supported. The negative value of the
path coef ﬁcient indicates that IR hinders the AU of digital payment systems. This con ﬁrms
that during demonetization, there was IR to the AU of digital payment systems and
supports the existing studies ( Molesworth and Suortti, 2002 ;Garcia and Atkin, 2002 ;Ram
and Sheth, 1989 )
Next addressing H14, the moderating effect of stickiness to cash payment (ST) on AU of
digital payment systems was evaluated using the interaction effect in path analysis of SEM.
Hence, value shows a signi ﬁcant moderating effect on the path connecting BI and AU (path
coefﬁcient = /C00.112, t-statistics = 1.722) which supports H14. The negative value of the
path coef ﬁcient signi ﬁes that stickiness to cash payment acts as an inhibitor to AU of digital
payment systems. Stickiness to cash payments emerged as an important factor affecting the
AU of digital payment systems in the era of demonetization and it also con ﬁrms the
previous research on mobile banking and e-commerce ( Hsu and Lin, 2016 ;Lin, 2007 )
The overall results show that AU of digital payment systems during demonetization is
negatively affected by the IR and stickiness to cash payments.

IR and AU of digital payment systems are as shown in Table VII .
The change in the R2value, when the speci ﬁed exogenous construct is omitted from the
model is measured by the f2. Finally, the f2, as a measure of the impact of a speci ﬁc
predictor variable on the endogenous construct are presented in addition to the R2values of
all endogenous constructs (BI, IR and AU) in Table VIII .
7. Discussion
On the basis of the results obtained after PLS-SEM analysis, it is found that the research
constructs PE, EE, SI, FC, HM and HA have a signi ﬁcant positive in ﬂuence on BI to use
digital payment systems.
PE has signi ﬁcant in ﬂuence on BI to use digital payment systems which is in line with
earlier research work ( Venkatesh et al., 2003 ;Oliveira et al., 2014 ;Tarhini et al., 2016 ). This
shows that consumers use digital payment systems, as it provides bene ﬁts to enhance their
daily ﬁnancial transactions. EE has signi ﬁcant effect on BI to use digital payment system
and con ﬁrms with earlier research ( Venkatesh et al., 2012 ;Zhou et al., 2010 ;Martins et al.,
2014). The result also con ﬁrms that SI has signi ﬁcant in ﬂuence on BI to use digital payment
systems which are similar to the previous research ( Venkatesh and Morris, 2000 ;VenkateshAdoption of
digital
payment
systems
Downloaded by La Trobe University At 09:19 06 January 2018 (PT)
and Davis, 2000 ;Tarhini et al., 2014 ;Venkatesh and Zhang, 2010 ). HM has effect on the BI to
use digital payment systems as per earlier studies ( Kim et al., 2008 ). HA signi ﬁcantly
inﬂuences the BI to use digital payment system which verify previous research ( Lankton
et al., 2010 ;Aarts and Dijksterhuis, 2000 ).
As per the results, IR constructs also impact the IR to digital payment systems. UB, VB,
RB, TB and IB have signi ﬁcant in ﬂuence on IR to digital payment systems which is
conﬁrms to previous studies ( Ram and Sheth, 1989 ;Laukkanen et al., 2009 ;Fain and
Roberts, 1997 ;Poon, 2008 ;Laukkanen and Lauronen, 2005 ;Fain and Roberts, 1997 ;Kleijnen
et al., 2009 ). There are barriers to use digital payment systems such as habits to use,
insecurity and traditional method of payment, that is use of cash. The challenges of digital
literacy among the consumers along with the required supporting infrastructure are the
major barriers in adoption of digital payment systems.
The results suggest that BI in ﬂuences the AU of digital payment systems and con ﬁrms
the earlier research ( Venkatesh and Zhang, 2010 ;Venkatesh et al., 2003 ,2012;Tarhini et al.,
2013,2016). The reach and penetration of the digital payment systems increased during the
demonetization period. This resulted in increase in the average time spent by the consumerand the usage frequency of digital payment systems.
IR has negative effect on the AU of digital payment systems due to various barriers like
UB, VB, RB, TB and IB, and it is alike with earlier studies ( Molesworth and Suortti, 2002 ;
Garcia and Atkin, 2002 ). Lack of high speed internet access, low digital literacy rate among
the consumers and lack of regular electricity supply posed severe challenges to the adoptionof digital payment systems. Digital payments leave a trail of disclosure giving access to theprivate lives of the consumers as banks and digital service providers have information of allthe consumer transactions. This issue of privacy and con ﬁdentiality was a primary source
of concern among the consumers which acts as a hindrance in the adoption process. During
the period of demonetization, commission and service charges were waived off as anincentive to trigger migration of consumers to digital payment systems. However, postdemonetization these charges will be applicable to digital payment systems which would actas an obstacle. This shows that consumers have resistance to use digital payment systems
due to above barriers.
As discussed above, UTAUT is superior predictive model for technology adoption than
other competing models like TAM, TPB and IDT. This study integrated the IRT model tostudy the IR and UTAUT model to study the reasons for adoption of digital paymentsystems which is a unique theoretical contribution.
In this study, ST to use cash payment shows the signi ﬁcant moderation between BI and
AU to use digital payment systems, and it is in line with earlier study ( Hsu and Lin, 2016 ;
Lin, 2007 ). Indian consumers are habitual of cash usage, as it is deeply rooted in the Indian
economic culture. A great level of trust is attached to cash-based payment systems, as it ismost preferred by citizens for buying and selling goods and services. Prior to the
demonetization, 98 per cent of transactions by volume were done by cash (
Jain, 2016 ). Cash
payments have assurance of anonymity, more cultural acceptance in the Indian context andhave dominated the spending habits of the consumers. Considering the abovementionedfacts, the researcher considers stickiness to cash payment as moderator which is a uniquecontribution of this study. Post demonetization, due to change in situational factors like
higher availability of cash and removal of cash withdrawal limits from ATMs and bank
accounts, stickiness to cash payments will actually re ﬂect whether the adoption of digital
payment systems was on a temporary basis or permanent, due to change in consumerbehavior. Stickiness to cash payments was considered in this study, as it highlights thetendency of the consumers to revert back to cash based systems. This requires a paradigmJSTPM

shift in the mentality of the consumers from cash to digital, which needs to be education-
driven and not simply by demonetization. This would ensure a long term and sustainable
usage of digital payment systems taking India toward a cashless society.
8. Theoretical contributions
UTAUT 2 is a well-accepted, empirically tested and valid research model that predicts thebehavioral intentional and AU of technology. This model is widely used due to its
robustness and simplicity compared to other adoption models. ( Venkatesh et al., 2012 ,2003;
Foon and Fah, 2011 ;Tarhini et al., 2015 ;Venkatesh and Zhang, 2010 ). The UTAUT 2 model
is extensively examined in the literature of technology adoption in developing countries
(Kamoun and Almourad, 2014 ;Al-Ajam and Nor, 2013 ;Tarhini et al., 2014 ;Zhao et al., 2012 ).
In this study, the UTAUT 2 model explained 60.9 per cent of the BI to use digital paymentsystems and this is the contribution of this research to exhibit the generality and validity ofthe UTAUT 2 model with reference to digital payment systems.
This research used the IRT to study the resistance of customers to adopt digital payment
systems. The theoretical model explained 44 per cent IR of customers to use digital payment
systems. Previous research studied the resistance with reference to mobile banking andinternet banking, regarding crucial security and privacy concerns ( Kuisma et al., 2007 ;
Luarn and Lin, 2005 ;Thakur and Srivastava, 2014 ). This study adds value to the existing
theory by integrating IRT with UTAUT 2 and generalizing it with the adoption of digital
payment systems in the context of a developing country like India. The integration ofUTAUT 2 and IRT explains the AU of 68.7 per cent of digital payment systems which is the
unique contribution of this study. This research has considered the different types of
respondents to study the AU of digital payment systems, and this study is unique in natureas it examined the adoption and AU of digital payment systems during the demonetization
period.
9. Implications
This study extends the existing literature by i ncorporating sticki ness to cash payments
as the moderator between BI and AU of digital payment systems. This work integratestwo theories –UTAUT 2 and IR to explain the AU of digital payment systems. The
unique theoretical contribution of this study is the integration of the UTAUT 2 adoption
theory along with the IRT. Although the various factors of adoption and determinants ofresistance have been studied independently in earlier studies, there exists no study that
investigates the adoption and resistance fa ctors related to digital payment systems in a
single integrated framework. The valuable insights provided by this study may be
considered by researchers in the areas of adoption of all future technologies.
The digital payment service providers need to ensure that the various barriers such as
UB, VB, RB, TB and IB need to be overcome by making the technology of digital paymentsystems more user-friendly. They need to minimize the privacy and security risk concerns
involved in digital payment systems and provide timely help and support regarding issues
faced with digital payment systems. They should play an active role in facilitating digitalliteracy and spread awareness among the consumers by running promotional campaigns
highlighting the bene ﬁts of cashless digital payment systems.
The results of this study have valuable implications for economist and policymakers. As
demonetization is a rare phenomenon which occurs in any economy, the results of this study
provide valuable insights to economists to systematically design a transition matrix forsmooth migration from cash based systems to cashless digital payment systems. They need
to consider stickiness, as it is crucial for long term sustainable adoption of digital paymentAdoption of

systems. It suggests that government has a crucial role by creating more awareness and
digital literacy among the citizens, facilitate the pace of adoption by greater capacity
building and providing supporting infrastructure. This will enable smooth migration from
traditional cash-based systems to digital payment systems.
This study has policy implications with reference to digital payment systems as the GoI
is promoting the “Digital India ”program. The results of this study can be used by
policymakers to understand the deterrents for people to adopt digital technologies and
digital payment systems. This work provides key insights to study the adoption of different
technologies promoted under the “Digital India ”program in future. The policymakers need
to study the barriers to digital payment systems and need to formulate policies to remove
these hindrances. The policymakers may direct the digital payment service providers to
provide more secure digital payment services. GoI is already promoting the Bharat Interface
for Money (BHIM) mobile app for digital payments in India, and this study has high
implications for policymakers of BHIM too, as outcome of this study can be considered for
the adoption of the BHIM mobile app. The results of this study shall be useful for designing
and optimizing the policies regarding the electronic payment framework for digital
payments and receipts for government to government, government to business, government
to citizens, government to employee and citizens to government. A paradigm shift in the
mindset of the citizens is required regarding the usage of digital payment systems apart
from awareness and training; so, the policymakers can consider the outcomes of this study
and develop policies accordingly.
10. Limitations and future research directions
This study surveyed the consumers in Pune city and its suburbs in India. Due to the
geographic limitations, caution needs to be exercised while generalizing this study in other
countries and cultural contexts. Other research constructs like government support,perceived value, trust and loyalty may be incorporate in further studies. The effects of socio-
demographic moderating variables like gender, occupation, income and education level may
be considered by future researchers. This research is delimited by the factors of UTAUT 2
and IR theory to explain AU of digital payment systems. Future research may consider
other technology adoption models.
