INTRODUCTION  
Digital eye strain (DES) has been a concern for the last 
20 years or so and with the ever increasing use  of digital 
devices ranging from computers, laptops, tablets and 
smartphones, the screen time of a millennial has 
increased exponentially. In April 2019, WHO made 
recommendations regarding screen time for under -five 
children: no screen time for less than 2  year olds; not 
more than 1 hour for children aged 2 -4 years, less  is 
better.1 
Several individuals suffer from physical discomfort after 
screen use for longer than two hours at a time. The Vision Council refers to this collection of symptoms as digital 
eye strain.2 The term ‘computer vision syndrome (CVS)’ 
has been widely used in literature; however, since many 
other digital devices are now in common use, ‘digital eye 
strain’ is a more appropriate term.3 The most common 
symptoms associated with DES are eyes train, headache, 
blurred vision, dry eyes and pain in the neck and 
shoulders.4 The ocular symptoms can be split in two 
categories -those associated with accommodation 
(namely, headache, blurred vision and difficulty 
refocusing) and those closely related to dry eye 
(irritated/burning eyes, dry eyes, tired eyes, sensitivity to 
bright lights and eye discomfort).5,6  
ABSTRACT  
 
Background:  The physical discomfort and collection of symptoms after digital screen use for longer than two hours 
at a time is referred by the Vision Council as digital eye strain (DES). Common symptoms of DES are eyestrain, 
headache, blurred vision, dry eyes and pain  in neck and shoulders. This study aims to know about the prevalence; 
factors associated with and awareness about preventive measures for DES among college students .  
Methods:  A cross-sectional study was conducted for 2 months in 2017 among randomly select ed 200 college students 
of 20 to 30 years of age in Indore city of Madhya Pradesh using a pre -designed semi -structured questionnaire.   
Results:  Mean age of participants was 22.5 years; of which 58% were females. Of the respondents, 89.5% (179 
students) rep orted experiencing DES. Average distance from digital screen, brightness level of digital device, use of 
digital device before going to sleep and awareness about appropriate distance of digital screen from eyes had 
statistically significant association wit h having digital eye strain. 98% of respondents were unaware of the term DES 
while >60% did not have knowledge about the harmful blue light emitted by digital devices, protective use of digital 
screen filters, appropriate distance of viewing digital screen  and the 20 -20-20 rule of taking breaks in between screen 
time.  
Conclusions:  Since digital device use is a necessary evil; better ergonomic practices to avoid DES should be adopted. 
Opportunistic health promotion and patient education undertaken by ophtha lmologists on an OPD basis is one 
solution .

print on paper. Moreover, viewing distances and angles 
tend to differ from normative non -digital viewing. Hence, 
eye focus and movement requirements for digital viewing 
impose additional strain on our visual systems .4 Another 
cause of DES is considered to be blue light, also called 
high-energy visible (HEV) light, emitted by digital 
devices wh ich increases eye strain more so than other 
colors that have a longer wavelength.7  
Ways to relieve DES include: eyewear solutions; taking 
frequent breaks from using digital devices; reducing 
overhead lighting to eliminate screen glare; positioning 
yoursel f at arm's distance away from the screen; 
increasing text size on devices to better define content on 
the screen.2  
DES affects about 90% of the people who spend three 
hours or more a day at a computer.8 There is clearly a 
surge in the use of digital scree ns which is here to stay. 
However, paucity of studies regarding correct practices 
and awareness to avoid DES remain despite proven 
hazards of this condition which led to this exercise. This 
study aims to know about the prevalence, factors 
associated with a nd awareness about preventive measures 
for DES among college going students of Indore city, 
Madhya Pradesh.  
METHODS  
A cross-sectional study was conducted for a duration of 2 
months in 2017 among randomly selected 200 college 
going students of age group 20 to 30 years in Indore city using a pre -designed semi -structured questionnaire 
enquiring into their digital device use pattern, symptoms 
of DES experienced by them, and their awareness 
regarding preventive measures for DES. Those who did 
not consent were ex cluded from the study. Sample size 
was calculated using the formula [z 1-a/22p(1-p)]/d2; taking 
expected proportion  (p) of 90%; absolute error  (d) of 5%; 
at type I error  (a) of 5% and 95% confidence interval  
(CI).  Those who experienced one or more symptom 
related to digital device use were considered to have 
DES. Data collected was entered in Excel sheet and 
analysed using software SPSS v.20.0. Descriptive 
statistics was expressed as frequency and percentage. Chi 
square and Fischer’s exact tests were applied accordingly. 
In this study the respondents were made aware about the 
causes and preventive measures for DES; however they 
could not be followed up for change in their digital screen 
practices and DES symptoms . 
RESULT S 
Of the respondents 42% students were males and 58% 
females; mean age being 22.5 years. Figure 1  represents 
the age distribution of the college going students in this 
study. The digital device preference among the students 
was maximum (61%) for smartp hones, 32.5% for 
PCs/laptops and 6.5% for television. Majority (63.5%) 
reported using digital devices for social networking, 29% 
for college related work, 4% for gaming and 3.5% for 
other purposes. Of the respondents 89.5% (179 students) 
reported experienc ing DES and only 10.5% (21 students) 
did not.  Table 1  depicts the intensity of various symptoms 
of DES experienced by the respondents.

DISCUSSION  
Prevalence  
In the present study, 89.5% students stated experiencing 
the symptoms of DES which is similar to that reported by 
Logaraj et al  and R eddy et al.9,10 The prevalence of DES 
or CVS ranged from 53 -73% in several other studies on 
computer users .11-17 In a study in Malaysia conducted on 
795 university students aged between 18 and 25 years, 
89.9% of students surveyed feeling any type of symptom 
of DES .10 
Age/gender  
Mean age of 22.5 years and  female predominance (58%) 
for DES which was found in this study was also shown in 
studies by Shantakumari et al  and Mowatt et  al on 
university students in UAE and Jamaica respectively.12,18 
However, various other studies on college students or computer users found a male preponderance of DES; 
mean age being between 21 to 25 years.9,11,15,16,19  
Digital device preference  
Smartphones and laptops were the most frequently used 
devices reported in similar studies by Ichhpujani  et al and 
Margareta et al.20,21 Students used digital devices mainly 
for social networking and college projects.  
Symptoms  
In the present study, 96.5% had difficulty in focusing, 
89% had headache, 83.5% tired eyes, 80.5% each had dry 
eyes and back pain, 80 % had watery eyes. Studies done 
by Shantakumari et al and several others also reported 
headache as the most common or disturbing symptom 
following the use of digital devices.10,14,18,19,22 Similar to 
the present study results, the other common symptoms 
which included tired eyes, watery eyes, dry eyes and back 
pain were also found by Moldovan et al  among 
Romanian computer using medical students.23 Blurred 
vision was the most common symptom reported by 
Lakachew et al  among bank workers and Dessie et al  
among computer users in Ethiopia.16,17 Choi et al  and 
Pinitpuwadol et al did comparative studies to explore the 
effect of digital device (smartphone and e -book 
respectively) use on tear film and ocular symptoms.24,25 
They concluded that the group using digital d evice 
showed higher fatigue, burning, and dryness scores than 
the control group; and digital device use significantly 
decreased FBUT and NIBUT. Study done by Krupinski 
et al and Salve et al  on radiologists and workers engaged 
in jewellery manufacturing res pectively revealed that 
these professions also pose risk in terms of high visual 
demands in their work hours and resulted in visual strain 
symptoms similar to digital eye strain.26,27 Lodina et al

computer screen task.28 
Factors associated with DES  
Average distance from digital screen, brightness level of 
digital device, use of digital device before going to sleep 
at night and awareness about the approp riate distance of 
digital screen from eyes had statistically significant 
association (<0.05) with having digital eye strain 
according to the present study. Inappropriate sitting 
posture and level of viewing digital screens were 
significantly associated wit h various symptoms of DES 
as reported in studies done by Lakachew et al and many 
others.17 Duration of digital screen time was shown be 
significantly associated in several studies.9,10,13,19,21,29,30 
Better ergonomic practices’ knowledge and practicing the  
preventive measures is significantly associated with DES 
symptoms as shown in studies done by Ranasinghe et al,  
Agarwal et al  and Shantakumari et al.11,14,18 Contact lens 
wearers are more likely to suffer DES than non ‐lens 
wearers according to Tauste et a l.31 Critical fusion 
frequency decreased significantly after visual task 
according to Lin et al  who studied the effects reflected 
glare and visual field lighting.32 
Knowledge about preventive measures for DES  
In the present study, 98% were unaware of the term DES 
while >60% respondents did not have knowledge about 
the harmful blue light emitted by digital devices, the 
protective use of digital screen filters, the appropriate 
distance of viewing digital screen and the 20 -20-20 rule 
of taking breaks in betwe en screen time.  
In the study done by Sitaula et al  only 22.9% had pre -
existing knowledge of CVS and only 25.5% of them were 
practicing the ideal viewing distance.19 According to the 
study done by  Palavets et al, a filter that eliminated 99% 
of the emitted blue light was no more effective at 
reducing symptoms of DES than an equiluminant neutral 
density filter.33 There is little evidence at this time to 
support the use of blue blocking (BB) filters to minimize 
near work–induced asthenopia. Study by Bhargavaa et al 
demonstrated the beneficial effect of orally administered 
omega -3-fatty acids in alleviating dry eye symptoms and 
decreasing tear evaporation rate in patients suffering from 
CVS related dry eye.34 According to the comparative 
randomized double masked  multicentric clinical trial by 
Biswas et al to find out the efficacy and safety of a herbal 
eye drop (itone) with artificial tear and placebo in CVS: 
the herbal eye drop preparation was found significantly 
better than artificial tear.35  
CONCLUSION   
Digit al device use in myriad forms ranging from 
smartphones to laptops lead to a high prevalence of a 
varied number of asthenopic symptoms collectively 
known as DES which is aggravated more due to inappropriate practices like inappropriate distance from 
digital  screen, inappropriate brightness levels and their 
use before going to sleep. Also, since use of digital 
devices in present times is a necessary evil; thus, better 
ergonomic practices like keeping the digital device at an 
arm’s length or more than 50 cm; u sing protective digital 
filters/screens/eye wears; taking visual breaks from 
screen (20 -20-20 rule) and having annual eye checkups is 
a feasible solution for such a public health concern. Also, 
more people should be made aware of the preventive 
measures th at can be taken to prevent DES. Opportunistic 
health promotion and patient education undertaken by 
ophthalmologists on an OPD basis is one solution.
