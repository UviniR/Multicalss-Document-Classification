est recessions over the past century, economic activity in the emerging and devel-
oping countries of Europe and Central Asia (ECA) contracted by 2.0 percent in 
2020. The pace of recovery in 2021 is expected to be at 3.6 percent, reflecting lin -
gering disruptions to activity from an earlier resurgence of COVID-19 and the emergence of more contagious variants of the virus. In the global context, this 
update summarizes recent developments and presents the outlook for the region. 
It also focuses on governance, a key development issue in the region, the impor -
tance of which has also been highlighted during the COVID-19 crisis, since gov -
ernment quality, public trust, and credibility are vital elements of success in fight -
ing the pandemic.
While activity in the region will rebound in 2021, recovery will be subdued. 
Per capita GDP is still forecast to remain almost 3 percent below its pre-pandemic 
trend by 2022.  Economies with strong trade or financial linkages to the euro area 
and those heavily dependent on services and tourism have been the hardest hit. 
The outlook remains highly uncertain and will continue to be shaped by the 
pandemic and vaccine development. Growth in 2021 may be weaker if the pan -
demic takes longer than expected to fade, external financing conditions tighten, or geopolitical tensions escalate again. 
Governments play a critical role in the economies of Europe and Central Asia, 
as government expenditures are close to 40 percent of gross domestic product. This is expected since richer countries tend to have larger governments, and 
many countries in the region are still transitioning to market-based economies. 
Government plays an equally important role in shaping labor markets across the 
region: the public sector employs 86 million people, or 25 percent of total employ -
ment, which is considerably higher than the global average of 16 percent. These shares vary across the region: in Belarus, the public sector employs almost 40 
percent of the labor force, whereas this figure is only 13 percent in Romania. The public sector often attracts some of the best educated workers in the region. Pub -
lic sector employees are considerably more educated than the average popula -
tion, particularly in lower income countries. For example, in the South Caucasus, 
Central Asia, and the Western Balkans, the share of individuals with tertiary edu -
cation employed in the public sector is more than double that in the average population. 
The role of government in ECA countries is likely to increase in the coming 
years. A third of the population in high-income countries and about 45 percent of Executive SummaryExecutive Summary  ●  xiii
citizens in the transition countries support expansion of the public sector. This is 
partly because the aging populations in the region require increased public ser -
vices such as health care, disability services, and long-term care. In addition, 
globalization and technological change have led to reduced job security and in-
comes for the most vulnerable, and the resulting rise in inequality has led to in -
creased demand for redistribution. Finally, the COVID-19 crisis has increased people’s risk aversion and reinforced their desire for the state to socialize indi -
vidual risks and play a more important role in public health systems, education, and social protection.
The significant role that government plays underscores the importance of the 
quality of governance in determining productivity and growth and effectively responding to the region’s economic and social challenges. Among the world 
regions, ECA has the greatest disparity in quality of governance according to the 
World Governance Indicators, as there is significant subregional variability. 
While progress in some parts of the region has been disappointing, overall the 
region has nevertheless seen significant improvement in government quality 
over the last two decades, particularly among countries that were originally un -
derperforming. For example, countries in the South Caucasus and the Western Balkans saw the greatest increases in the quality of governance over the past 20 
years. 
Improving the productivity of the public sector can have a profound impact 
on the economies of ECA, where state capacity in many countries is still weak. Digital technology and the data revolution offer the potential to increase effi -
ciency, transparency, responsiveness, and citizen trust, directly impacting the quality of government. Across the world, the quality of government is increas -
ingly informed by the extent to which governments harness digital tools and GovTech to optimize management, service delivery, and overall state capacity. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the costs associated with delaying digi -
talization and GovTech implementation and the opportunities that lie in public 
sector modernization. 
Technology and data are vital for fostering collaboration between govern -
ments and civil society. Many citizens in ECA mistrust the government and view 
political decisions as not very transparent. The data revolution and digitalization 
offer an opportunity to change this situation by fostering collaboration between 
governments and civil society to enhance public sector efficiency and service 
delivery. One of the most promising mechanisms for doing so is Open Govern -
ment Data, which reduces the transaction costs of gathering, analyzing, and dis-seminating public sector data and allows for a more comprehensive understand -
ing of the quality of governance as a whole. 
The analysis in this report proposes policy recommendations, grounded in 
empirical evidence, for harnessing the data revolution to improve governance 
across ECA. The recommendations include (a) implementing incentive structures 
to encourage the adoption and adaptation of data systems within the civil ser -
vice, (b) expanding the impact of the data revolution through enhanced govern-ment digitalization and intersectoral coordination of decentralized data systems 
across institutions, (c) fostering platforms for citizens to hold government xiv ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update Spring 2021
accountable over their broad approach to using data, and (d) redefining the fire -
wall between citizens and government by experimenting with direct feedback. 
Much has been accomplished, but much more needs to be done. For example, 
21 of the 50 ECA countries—including most of those in Eastern Europe, the West -
ern Balkans, the South Caucasus, and Central Asia—do not have high-level coor -
dination for data governance and management. And 30 countries in the region 
lack a GovTech institution supporting interoperability and interconnectivity be -
tween government agencies. Open Government Data commitments need to be implemented. Many ECA countries do not have centralized web portals where 
individuals can address the government with concerns or provide feedback. Im -
proving broadband internet coverage and use, particularly in Central Asia, needs 
to be a priority for meaningful digital connectivity. PART
The Economic Outlook and 
Long-term ChallengesI3
Global Context
The COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the global economy into a deep recession whose 
depth was surpassed only by the two World Wars and the Great Depression over the past 
century and a half. Although global economic activity has picked up again, global gross 
domestic product (GDP) is not likely to recover for the foreseeable future.  Despite the 
substantial progress made in the development of vaccines, the sharp resurgence of CO -
VID-19 at the start of 2021 has cast a shadow over the global recovery, as countries have 
been forced to retighten social distancing measures. The rebound in global growth is expected 
to be bolstered by gradual improvement in confidence, consumption, and trade, as well as by 
ongoing vaccination. Downside risks still predominate however, including the possibility 
of a further increase in the spread of the virus, delays in vaccine procurement and distri -
bution, as well as financial stress triggered by high debt levels and weak growth.
COVID-19 Pandemic and Overall Trends
Following a collapse in economic activity last year due to the COVID-19 pan -
demic, global growth has rebounded in 2021. The pace of the global recovery, 
however, was subdued at the start of 2021, as countries grappled with the spread 
of more transmissible strains of COVID-19, which forced the extension or reintro -
duction of lockdown measures of varying stringency. The baseline forecast in January envisioned a 4 percent expansion of global GDP in 2021 (World Bank 
2021). This projection was predicated on proper pandemic management and vac-

would help mitigate diminishing fiscal support. After this year’s pickup, global 
growth was forecast to moderate to 3.8 percent in 2022—still above its potential 
pace but weighed down by lasting damage from COVID-19 (figure 1.1, panel A). 
At this rate, global per capita GDP would remain 4.4 percent below pre-pandemic 
projections by 2022, reflecting the dampening effects of lingering risk aversion on 
the demand side and of diminished physical and human capital accumulation on 
labor productivity.
A sharp rise in daily new COVID-19 cases in late 2020 softened the incipient 
recovery in global activity (figure 1.1, panel B). For several economies, however,

renewed weakness was concentrated in service sectors as governments opted for 
targeted or less stringent lockdowns rather than economywide shutdowns. Ac -
cordingly, resilience in industrial activity—which mirrored a recovery in global goods trade—provided support, with output surpassing Consensus expectations 
in several economies in the fourth quarter of 2020 (figure 1.1, panel C). Various 
economic indicators, including the Global Composite Purchasing Managers’ In -
dex (PMI) and the Sentix index, pointed to firming activity in early 2021 as the number of daily new cases stabilized and vaccine deployment supported inves -
tor sentiment. Although vaccination is underway, with about 5.3 percent of the global population having received at least one dose of the many available vac -
cines, progress has been uneven across countries. While vaccinations are gather -
ing pace in advanced economies, doses have not yet been administered in about half of the emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs) and in most 
low-income countries by mid-March (figure 1.1, panel D). 
In 2020, the U.S. economy contracted 3.5 percent (year-on-year)—broadly in 
line with Consensus expectations—leaving output in the final quarter of the year 
2.5 percent below its pre-pandemic 2019 fourth quarter level. Substantial fiscal 
support to household incomes—far exceeding similar measures delivered during 
the global financial crisis—contributed to a robust initial rebound, which was subsequently cut short by a broad resurgence of the pandemic. Heading into 
2021, the economy remained resilient, notwithstanding elevated COVID-19 cases 
and the ongoing drag of pandemic control measures on the service sector. The 
American Rescue Plan was passed in March 2021, and is expected to provide an 
additional $1.9 trillion of support, or about 9 percent of GDP . 
As a result of the COVID-19 shock, output in the euro area collapsed by 6.8 
percent in 2020 and remained 5.1 percent below its pre-pandemic level in the 
fourth quarter. More recently, sharp flareups in new COVID-19 infections, ex -
tended restrictions, and slow vaccine rollout are setting the stage for possible 
deterioration. Resilient growth in manufacturing, however, will help offset con -
tinued weakness in the service sector (figure 1.2, panel A). Against the backdrop of a historical recession, the policy response has been far-reaching and sustained. 
National fiscal support packages were bolstered by grants from the European 
Union (EU) to the hardest hit member countries, which are expected to support 
activity in 2021.
In China, GDP expanded by 2.3 percent in 2020—slightly higher than the Con -
sensus forecast of 2.1 percent—supported by public investment–led stimulus. 
Accommodative fiscal and monetary policies led to a sharp increase in the gov -
ernment deficit and total debt. More recently, incoming high-frequency data, in -
cluding the official Manufacturing PMI and non-Manufacturing PMI, eased amid an uptick in new COVID-19 cases (figure 1.2, panel B). 
Global trade collapsed in 2020—declining an estimated 9 percent—as border 
closures and supply disruptions interrupted the international provision of goods 
and services (UNCTAD 2021a). Goods trade fell more rapidly and rebounded 
more swiftly than during the global financial crisis, with the volume of global 
goods trade surpassing its pre-pandemic level in November 2020 (figure 1.2, 
panel C). The pace of recovery in goods trade, however, appears to be moderat -
ing in early 2021. Meanwhile, services trade remains depressed as the virus 6 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update Spring 2021

continues to persist and impede face-to-face interactions and international travel 
and tourism. Accordingly, the global new services export orders PMI subindex 
has continued to contract in early 2021, signaling further weakness on the ser -
vices trade front. Although international travel has improved from its trough (about a year ago), it has stabilized far below pre-pandemic levels due in part to 
COVID-19 travel restrictions. The departure of the United Kingdom from the 
European Single Market and the European Union Customs Union has thus far 
had only a muted impact on bilateral trade. Still, many businesses are reporting 
difficulties complying with the new regulations.
Aggressive policy actions by central banks kept the global financial system 
from falling into crisis last year. Although the global stock market rally was briefly interrupted in January 2021 amid a spike in risk aversion, risky assets 
continued to appreciate on the back of new stimulus measures in the United 
States and the rollout of vaccines lifted market sentiment. Overall, global finan -
cial conditions remained exceptionally benign as major central banks reaffirmed the continuation of their asset purchases, but signs of rising inflation expectations 
are emerging and triggering a steepening of yield curves (figure 1.2, panel D). 
After a brisk rebound at the end of 2020, portfolio inflows to EMDEs lost mo -
mentum in early 2021 amid rising global yields, asset market rotation, and con -
cerns about monetary policy tightening in some major advanced economies (fig-
ure 1.2, panel E). Despite the uptick in interest rates, aggregate credit spreads on 
EMDE bonds have widened only slightly since reaching post-2020 lows in early 
February. Diverging recovery prospects and increased risks of tighter market ac -
cess for some EMDEs, however, have contributed to a deceleration of bond issu -
ance. Although financial conditions remain somewhat benign, underlying vul -
nerabilities are growing, including rising debt levels and weakening bank balance sheets.
Most commodity prices rebounded over the second half of 2020; however, the 
pickup in energy prices initially lagged the broader recovery in commodity prices due to the prolonged impact of the pandemic on global demand (World 
Bank 2020a). However, energy prices experienced a robust rebound in early 2021, 
and other commodity prices continued to firm (figure 1.2, panel F). Brent crude 
rose above $65/barrel in February for the first time in a year, supported by pro -
duction restraint by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries Plus (OPEC+). Following an agreement reached in January to extend production cuts, 
the group’s production as a whole is expected to be nearly 0.5 million barrels per 
day lower in February and March than during the second half of 2020. The in -
crease in prices has occurred despite downgrades to the International Energy 
Agency’s oil demand outlook due to renewed lockdowns. 
Metals prices are also rising, driven in large part by robust demand from 
China. Agricultural prices rose to their highest level since 2014 at the start of this 
year, with large increases in the prices of grains and oilseeds, with maize prices 
in particular driven by surging demand from China. Production shortfalls in 
some regions, including for soybeans in South America as a result of dry weather 
and palm oil in South Asia, are also supporting food prices. Some EMDE re -
gions are experiencing localized food price spikes that exceed the rise at the 
global level.8 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update Spring 2021
Global Risks
The global forecast published in January expected a baseline recovery of 4 per -
cent in 2021 and 3.8 percent in 2022. Although incoming data point to a poten -
tially stronger rebound, the materialization of several downside risks could de -
rail the global recovery (figure 1.3 panel A). The spread of the virus could 
reaccelerate if pandemic control measures fail or vaccine deployment faces de -
lays or bottlenecks. While the pace of vaccination accelerated at the start of 2021 in advanced economies and some large EMDEs, nearly half of the EMDEs and 
low-income countries had yet to administer any doses by mid-March. The risk of 
the virus and its damaging impact on the global economy thus looms in the ab -
sence of widespread inoculation. The recent emergence of new, more transmis -
sible variants of the virus also poses challenges to containment efforts. 
A renewed worsening of the pandemic would also exacerbate existing 
strains—prolonged economic weakness could trigger a wave of bankruptcies; bank balance sheets could be further impaired; governments might be unable to 
continue providing support; and, in some circumstances, temporary bouts of un -
employment and business shutdowns could become permanent. The risks of fi -
nancial crises are increasing owing to surging debt, weak activity, eroded capital 
buffers in the banking system, and elevated risk asset valuations. Analysis of 
stock prices reveals that the adverse impact of the COVID-19 shock on banks was more pronounced and long lasting than on corporates, suggesting that the coun -
tercyclical lending role that banks around the world are expected to play has put the sector under significant pressure. These vulnerabilities will need to be watched 
carefully as the impact of the pandemic on the corporate sector continues to be re -
vealed (box 1.1).

The spread of COVID-19 represents an unprec -
edented global shock, with the disease itself 
and mitigation efforts—such as social distanc -
ing measures and partial and national lockdown measures—having a significant impact on the economy. In the immediate aftermath, the financial sector, particularly banks, was expected to play an important role in absorbing the shock by supply -
ing vital credit to the corporate sector and house -
holds. In an effort to facilitate this, central banks and governments around the world enacted a wide range of policy measures to provide greater liquid -
ity and support the flow of credit. An important policy question is the potential impact of these countercyclical lending policies on the future sta -
bility of banking systems and the extent to which their strengthened capital positions since the global financial crisis will allow them to absorb this shock without undermining their resilience.
In a recent paper, Demirg üc-Kunt, Pedraza, and 
Ruiz-Ortega (2020) use daily stock prices and other balance sheet information for a sample of banks in 
53 countries to take a look at this issue. They first 
assess the impact of the pandemic on the bank -
ing sector and investigate whether the shock had a differential impact on banks versus corporates, as 
well as by different bank characteristics. Second, 
using a global database of financial sector policy 
responses and an event study methodology, the 
authors investigate the effects that different pol -
icy initiatives had on bank stress as perceived by markets, in the aggregate, as well as across differ -
ent banks. (This data set was compiled and made publicly available by the World Bank). 
The results suggest that the adverse impact of 
the COVID-19 shock on banks was much more pro -
nounced and long-lasting than on corporates and other non-bank financial institutions, revealing the 
expectation that banks are to absorb at least part of the shock to the corporate sector (figure B1.1.1). 
The authors also show that banks with lower pre-
crisis liquidity buffers experienced larger than nor -
mal price drops.Banking sector pandemic: bank stocks and the response to

Next, the authors investigate more than 400 
policy announcements between February and 
April 2020. The financial sector policy initiatives 
are classified as follows. (i) Liquidity support mea -
sures are used by monetary authorities to expand banks’ short-term funding in domestic and foreign 
currency. (ii) Prudential measures deal with the 
temporary relaxation of regulatory and supervisory 
requirements, including capital buffers. (iii) Bor -
rower assistance measures include government-sponsored credit lines or liability guarantees. (iv) 
Monetary policy measures include policy rate cuts 
and quantitative easing. To investigate the mar -
ket response to each policy measure, the authors study abnormal returns to bank stocks around 
announcement days. The results (summarized in 
figure B1.1.2) are as follows:
• Announcements of liquidity support were 
associated with large increases in banks’ 
stock prices. It appears that access to cen -
tral bank refinancing and initiatives that address shortages in bank funding had a 
calming effect on markets, as evidenced by 
BOX 1.1
the overperformance of bank stocks around 
these events. These initiatives also seem 
to reduce the liquidity risk premium, as 
banks with lower liquidity provisions expe -
rienced larger abnormal returns after the 
announcements.
• Borrower assistance announcements had a 
strong and immediate impact on bank stock 
prices in advanced countries. Such policies, 
which typically include the introduction of 
government guarantees, automatically trans -
fer risks from banks’ balance sheets to the 
sovereign, often requiring large fiscal com -
mitments. Relatedly, the authors find that 
for developing countries, where there is less 
room for fiscal expansion, borrower support 
initiatives had no effect on bank stocks.
• In contrast, prudential measures seem to have had only a minor impact on bank stock 
prices, and in some cases the effect appears 
to be negative. The results suggest that mar -
kets are pricing the downside risk from the 
depletion of capital buffers, as well as the

These developments follow a decade that featured the largest, fastest, and 
most broad-based increase in debt on record (Kose et al. 2020). Fiscal support and 
private sector borrowing to weather the shock from COVID-19 have pushed debt 
even higher (figure 1.3, panel B). Although low interest rates mitigate risks for 
some countries, elevated debt levels nonetheless increase the vulnerability to a 
shift in market conditions. Many borrowers would struggle to finance fiscal and 
current account deficits if investor sentiment were to deteriorate suddenly. Un -
derdeveloped capital markets in many EMDEs pose risks to banking, corporate, and government funding in the event of renewed tightening in global financial 
conditions (IOSCO 2020). Although global financial conditions remain somewhat benign, inflation expectations are rising in some large, advanced countries. A 
sharp reassessment of inflation could trigger a sudden tightening in global fi -
nancing conditions—in turn, higher funding costs could lead to forced austerity or disruptive defaults that result in lost access to international debt markets.
Compounding pandemic-related risks are those related to elevated policy un -
certainty, especially as countries navigate the challenge of unwinding macroeco -
nomic support with fostering the recovery. Similarly, an escalation in geopolitical tensions, such as the ones recently observed between the EU and China, could 
also have a material impact on the global outlook.
Europe and Central Asia: Recent Developments 
and Outlook
Economic activity in EMDEs in Europe and Central Asia (ECA) is estimated to have 
contracted by 2 percent in 2020 in the wake of disruptions related to the COVID-19 
pandemic. The pandemic is expected to erase at least five years of per capita income gains 
in about a sixth of the region’s economies and raise the poverty headcount. Economies (continued)
additional expansion of riskier loans in the 
balance sheets of banks. It is possible that in 
countries with financial vulnerabilities before 
the start of the crisis, banks were deemed to 
be in a worse position after the use of coun -
tercyclical measures.
• The results for monetary policy announce -
ments are more mixed. Although such announcements were not associated with 
aggregate bank stock price increases, they 
did seem to reduce the liquidity premium, 
confirming that policy rate cuts and quantita -
tive easing represented a key tool during the crisis.
BOX 1.1
This evidence suggests that the countercycli -
cal lending role that banks around the world are 
expected to play has put the sector under signifi -
cant pressure. Although policy measures such as liquidity support, borrower assistance, and mon -
etary easing moderated this adverse impact for some banks, this was not true for all banks or in all 
circumstances. For example, borrower assistance 
measures and prudential measures exacerbated 
the stress for banks that were already undercapital -
ized and/or operated in countries with little fiscal space. These vulnerabilities will need to be care -
fully monitored in the coming year as the pandemic continues to take a toll on the world’s economies. 12 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update Spring 2021
with strong trade or financial linkages to the euro area and those heavily dependent on 
services and tourism were the hardest hit. The pace of recovery in 2021 is projected to be 
faster than originally anticipated, at 3.6 percent, as firming external demand and stabiliz -
ing industrial commodity prices partly offset a recent flare-up in new COVID-19 cases. Growth is then expected to rise to 3.8 percent in 2022, as the effects of the pandemic 
gradually wane and the recovery in trade and investment gathers momentum. The out-
look remains highly uncertain and growth could be weaker than envisioned if the pan -
demic takes longer than expected to fade, external financing conditions tighten, policy uncertainty spikes, or geopolitical tensions escalate again.
Recent Developments
The COVID-19 pandemic has generated a major health and economic crisis in 
ECA, which has been further compounded by social unrest and conflict. CO -
VID-19 has infected 15.5 million people in the region, making ECA the second hardest hit region in per capita terms after Latin America and the Caribbean.
1 The 
rate of new cases sharply accelerated starting in the fourth quarter of last year, 
forcing governments to maintain or reintroduce mitigation measures well into 
2021. Analyzing the experience with the first wave of the pandemic and the dif -
ferent opening-up trajectories adopted by countries suggests that a gradual and transparent process will again need to be followed to minimize the health costs 
and increase the chances of a faster recovery (box 1.2). 
Following several weeks of restrictions, the number of daily new cases fell by 
about 75 percent in early 2021. Although the Russian Federation accounts for 
about a quarter of the region’s total cases, cumulative cases per capita are higher in all ECA subregions, with the exception of Central Asia. Six ECA countries—
Montenegro, Hungary, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, North Macedonia, 
and Croatia—are among the 10 EMDEs with the highest per capita number of 
deaths from COVID-19 (figure 1.4, panel A).
Regional GDP is estimated to have contracted by 2 percent in 2020 (figure 1.4, 
panel B), with nearly all the economies in recession and roughly two-thirds expe -
riencing deeper contractions than during the global financial crisis. The contrac -
tion was smaller than anticipated due to a robust recovery in Turkey, especially, 
as well as resilience in other economies despite heightened geopolitical tensions. Industrial production rebounded to pre-pandemic levels and goods trade firmed 
on the back of improving external demand, particularly from China. However, 
services activity remained subdued, as social distancing measures and sustained 
weakness in international tourism weighed on its recovery. 
Although the regional recovery was interrupted by a sharp resurgence of the 
virus in late 2020, the slowdown was shallower than during the initial outbreak, 
reflecting resilience in industrial activity and an improvement in commodity 
prices. The development of multiple, effective vaccines also bolstered confidence. 
To varying degrees, the resilience also reflected the regional economy’s ability to adapt and adjust to containment measures (figure 1.4, panel C). Nonetheless, 
1. In this section, ECA refers to the 23 EMDEs in ECA for which the World Bank forecasts 
GDP growth. Chapter 1: The Continuing COVID-19 Pandemic and the Economic Outlook  ● 13
When the COVID-19 pandemic first hit countries 
in Europe during March-April 2020, little informa -
tion was available about the nature of the pan -
demic, and the outcomes of projected scenarios 
were highly uncertain. The policy response was 
essentially a checklist or rules-based protocols 
designed by public health officials in the “fog of 
war” based on experiences with similar commu -
nicable diseases. Once the first wave of the pan -
demic started to wane, countries started to open 
up their economies. 
In a recent paper, Demirgüç-Kunt, Lokshin, and 
Torre (2020) provide evidence on the effects of dif -
ferent reopening trajectories and trust in govern -
ment on economic activity as countries emerged 
from the first set of restrictions imposed during the 
spring of 2020. A second wave of the pandemic 
hit the region in the fall of 2020, prompting the 
reimplementation of restrictions, which have been in place well into 2021. Despite the invention of 
vaccines, new strains of the virus and a slow rollout 
of vaccinations mean that the achievement of herd 
immunity is unlikely before the second half of 2021. 
Hence, the experience with the reopening process 
after the first wave of the pandemic can provide use -
ful guidance as countries embark on their second and future reopenings while the virus and its muta -
tions continue to present a serious health threat. 
In response to the first wave, most countries in 
Europe went into national lockdowns almost simul -
taneously in the second half of March 2020. The 
reopening policies of early summer 2020 did not 
follow such a uniform script, however, with coun -
tries following quite different reopening paths. To illustrate this, figure B1.2.1 plots the median values 
and 25th and 75th percentiles of the Government Response Stringency Index and its distribution at 
every point in time in 45 countries in Europe and 
Central Asia. The Stringency Index represents an 
aggregate of countries’ policy responses to the 
pandemic and ranges from 0 (no restrictions on 
everyday activities) to 100 (complete lockdown of the country) (Hale et al. 2020). The difference 
between the 25th and 75th percentiles was at its minimum on April 11-12, 2020, when more than 90 
percent of the countries had implemented a full 
lockdown. That difference more than doubled by 
mid-June 2020—some countries were still under 
strict social distancing measures while others had 
removed restrictions on most activities. By fall, 
some countries opened further, and others scaled 
back the reopening measures in light of the second 
wave of COVID-19 cases. 
The sequence in which different social and 
economic activities restart their normal operation 
is an important dimension of the reopening pro -
cess. Figure B1.2.2 plots the share of countries that had in place a specific type of nonpharmaceutical 
intervention at every point in time. Most countries 
shifted from having a full lockdown to a partial 
lockdown during the late spring of 2020 and then removed lockdown measures altogether—keep -
ing in place school closures and restrictions on public events. Schools were gradually reopened, 
and many countries also lifted the ban on public 
events. By early September 2020, about 12 percent 
of countries were in full lockdown, 18 percent had 
partial lockdowns, schools remained fully closed 
in 20 percent, and restrictions on public events 
remain in about 50 percent of the countries.
Another important dimension of the reopening 
process is its timing in relation to the pandemic’s 
evolution. The reopening wait is defined as the 
number of days between the first peak of deaths 
and the first date when the Stringency Index 
decreased from its maximum value (the start of 
the reopening process). A short wait is associated 
with an early reopening that started soon after the peak of the outbreak, with the negative wait values 
suggesting that the reopening process took place 
before the peak was reached. In contrast, a long 
wait is associated with a later reopening that starts 
long after the outbreak’s peak. Some countries 
spent a long time in full lockdown and started to Lessons after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic:

undo some of the restrictions only when COVID-
19 cases had decreased considerably. Other coun -
tries began reopening when the infection rates were still high or not decreasing. The median wait 
in the sample of countries is 11 days after the peak 
of the outbreak. A quarter of the countries started 
relaxing their restrictions before the first peak. The 
Russian Federation initiated the earliest reopening, 
only one week after implementing a full lockdown 
and almost two months before its COVID-19 deaths 
peaked. In contrast, Sweden took the longest time 
to scale back its restrictions, 57 days after the peak 
of COVID-19-related deaths, but it never imple -
mented severe restrictions in the first place. 
Another dimension of interest is the speed of 
the reopening process—how fast the restrictions were lifted. Analyzing the changes in the Strin -
gency Index provides a daily measure of the speed 
of reopening. For each country, figure B1.2.3 plots 
BOX 1.2
the average speed of reopening against the Strin -
gency Index at the beginning of their reopening 
process. On average, countries with a higher Strin -
gency Index at the start of the process eventually reopened their economies faster than countries 
with lower levels of restrictions, but the dispersion 
is large. For example, Italy and Ireland had similar 
levels of restrictions at the peak of the pandemic, 
but the average reopening speed for Ireland was 
about four times higher than that for Italy.

reopening process on economic recovery using a 
panel data econometric model. The primary out -

electricity consumption. The results suggest that countries that adopted a gradual and staged

Note: The speed of reopening is expressed as daily changes in the smoothed Stringency In -
dex. The Stringency Index is the Oxford Stringency Index by Hale et al. (2020) at the start of

mobility trends deteriorated and the Composite PMIs and Manufacturing PMIs 
faltered across the region.
All in all, five or more years of per capita income gains are estimated to have 
been erased due to the pandemic in about one-sixth of the economies in 2020. The 
economies that have been hardest hit by the pandemic are those with strong trade 
or financial linkages to the euro area and those that are heavily dependent on 
services and tourism (Croatia, Kosovo, and Montenegro). Mounting job losses in 
Europe and the impact of the oil price collapse in Russia initially weighed on 
remittances, but they have rebounded strongly as migrant workers have (continued)
reopening experienced stronger economic recov-
ery compared with the countries that rushed into 
lifting the restrictive measures. The transition from 
full to partial to no lockdown appears to be a more 
effective strategy of lifting the restrictions than a 
direct move from full to no lockdown. Similarly, 
economic activity seems to react positively to par -
tial school reopening, compared with full school reopening. 
The timing of reopening, defined as the number 
of days countries wait after the first peak of deaths 
before they start reopening, also matters. Open -
ing before the peak reduces electricity consump -
tion relative to the predicted level, while delaying 
reopening past the peak leads to faster recovery. 
However, when this decision is modeled to be 
based strictly on epidemiological considerations, it 
has no effect on the path of economic recovery. The analysis shows that countries that gradually lifted the 
stringency measures, rather than lifting them faster, 
experienced a more robust economic recovery. 
Trust in government institutions is generally an 
important determinant of the effectiveness of poli -
cies on economic outcomes. In this case, high lev -
els of trust in government (and interpersonal trust) 
are likely to be associated with better compliance 
with social distancing measures. Demirgüç-Kunt, 
Lokshin, and Torre (2020) also explore the effects 
of trust in government and people’s perceptions 
about the pandemic on the recovery process, 
using data from the 2018 round of the European 
Social Survey and the 2016 Life in Transition Survey. 
BOX 1.2
They find that governance, particularly trust in gov -
ernment institutions, is an essential determinant of economic recovery. Specifically, their results 
show that a higher level of trust in government is 
associated with a faster recovery among countries 
that carried out a gradual reopening process. The 
analysis also shows that fear and anxiety about the 
spread of the pandemic may hinder the recovery 
of economic activity as countries reopen. There is 
suggestive evidence that providing the population 
objective information and data about the prog -
ress of the pandemic could be an effective policy instrument in promoting faster recovery, although 
causality is difficult to establish.
The findings have important policy implica -
tions for the second wave of the COVID-19 pan -
demic that swept most of the world in late 2020. Given the “pandemic fatigue” and growing public exhaustion and frustration with restrictions, public 
officials in many countries were initially more reluc -
tant to introduce strict interventions, fearing their economic impact, although they quickly found 
themselves with few other options as the second 
wave of the pandemic worsened. As countries start 
their second reopening process, Demirgüc-Kunt, 
Lokshin, and Torre’s (2020) results suggest that a 
careful, gradual, and transparent reopening pro -
cess is likely to be optimal for minimizing the health costs of the pandemic and increasing the chances 
of a faster recovery. The results also suggest the 
importance of building trust for governments to 
increase their chances of success in this process.

2. There could be several explanations for the observed recovery of remittance flows in the 
second half of 2020 and early 2021. Some studies indicate that migrants might have drawn on their saving to send money home during the pandemic, or that some migrants were able to access cash transfers offered by host country governments. Another relevant explanation for ECA is a shift in flows from informal (unrecorded) hand-carrying to formal (recorded) remittance channels. The emerging studies (for example, Dinarte et al., 2021) indicate that the mobility constraints that prevented travelers from carrying cash across borders made electronic wire transfers the only option to remit. Because wire transfers are registered by the central banks, many countries saw an increase in formal remittances over the past sev -
eral months. However, the impact of this compositional shift on the total amount of remit -
tances is unclear. Sources: Haver Analytics; Oxford University; UNCTAD; World Bank.

nounced in some Central European countries and Russia. As countries gradually 
withdraw labor support measures, however, job losses could swell again. This 
could undermine an inclusive recovery in parts of the region, particularly in East -
ern Europe, where increases in the unemployment rate have been higher for fe -
males relative to males during the pandemic (ILO 2021). 
It is estimated that the pandemic will push an additional 2.2 million people 
under the $3.20 a day poverty line in the region. At the $5.50 a day poverty line, 
which is more commonly used in upper-middle-income countries, this figure is 
as high as six million. Household surveys in some countries, particularly in Cen -
tral Asia, have been reporting an uptick in food insecurity (figure 1.5, panels A 
and B) (World Bank 2020h). Even prior to the pandemic, households in some ECA 
economies—mainly in Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and the South Caucasus—
were spending more than 40 percent of their budget on food (UNECE 2020). 
The poor and the vulnerable generally bear a disproportionately higher bur -
den of the pandemic, representing the majority of job losses. Moreover, they sel -
dom benefit equally from the recovery, underscoring the importance of prioritiz -
ing policies to promote inclusive recovery. Box 1.3 expands on this issue by 
providing insights from the Turkish experience with the pandemic and 
recovery.
Economic performance in the ECA region has diverged recently, reflecting the 
fragmented approach to COVID-19 vaccine procurement and distribution. Lead -
ing up to the rollout of multiple vaccines in ECA, activity in the region’s two 
largest economies—Russia and Turkey—was more resilient than previously an -
ticipated. This was especially the case in Turkey, where full-year GDP exceeded expectations and grew 1.8 percent, with growth in the fourth quarter of 2020 
eclipsing all other Group of Twenty (G20) economies except China. In addition to

COVID-19 is the largest public health and eco -
nomic crisis to hit the world in nearly a century. The 
crisis has revealed deep inequalities, with the poor 
bearing a disproportionately higher burden. 
In the case of Turkey, poverty was on a down -
ward trend until the 2018 currency crisis and 
inequality has been on the rise in recent years. 
Recent analysis using micro data on job losses and 
household consumption to gauge the impact of 
the pandemic suggests that the crisis may create 
1.6 million new poor in Turkey, setting back pov -
erty reduction gains by three years. 
To contain the spread of infections when the 
pandemic first struck Turkey in March last year, the government imposed strict measures that reduced 
human mobility by 70–80 percent. As a result, 
economic activity plunged, shrinking the Turkish 
economy by 9.9 percent in the second quarter of 2020. Together with massive disruptions in global 
trade and tourism, this led to the destruction of 2.6 
million jobs (9.2 percent of total employment) in a 
matter of weeks. But a closer look at the numbers 
shows significant variability in the effects of the 
pandemic on different segments of the popula -
tion. Figure B1.3.1 shows that the bulk of the job cuts impacted informal workers, the lower-skilled, as well as women. Compared with male workers, 
female workers were three times more likely to become unemployed given their concentration in 
activities that were highly affected by the contain -
ment measures, such as hospitality, food, tourism, 
and other services. 
All in all, in Turkey, the poor and the vulnerable 
(those above the poverty line but with high levels of economic insecurity), representing the bottom 
40 percent of the income distribution, account for 
6 in 10 jobs that vanished during the crisis (figure B1.3.2). In stark contrast, the better-off were much less likely to stop working, and the top decile of the income distribution even enjoyed net job gains. At the same time, at the peak of the crisis, four mil -
lion people (12.3 percent of employment) opted out or decided not to enter the labor market due to weak job prospects or school closures. This set -
back is particularly worrisome for women, whose labor force participation declined by 5.2 percent -
age points to 29.2 percent between April 2019 and April 2020. Bringing them back to the market may prove challenging. It took Turkey almost a decade of robust and stable growth to lift female labor force participation by a similar rate. Need for an inclusive recovery: insights from the COVID-19

(Continued next page)In addition to the losses in income from the 
crisis, high inflation—largely fueled by monetary 
and credit expansion policies to stimulate the 
economy—further squeezed the already strained 
purchasing power of poor households. In the sec -
ond half of 2020, the prices of basic goods and ser -
vices with a high share in the typical consumption 
basket of low-income families recorded significant 
increases: prices of unprocessed foods rose by 19.8 
percent, bread and cereals by 16.3 percent, and 
transport by 14.7 percent. The overall Consumer 
Price Index rose by 12.6 percent. 
Unequal Recovery 
The Turkish economy rebounded strongly in the third quarter of 2020 as the first wave of COVID-
19 subsided, the stimulus package kicked in, and 
restrictions on mobility were eased. As of Septem -
ber 2020, 72 percent of the jobs that had been lost (1.9 million) had been regained. But the job recov -
ery has been unequal, benefitting mainly formal and skilled workers. As of September, more than 
half a million women remained out of the labor market and another half a million who were unem -
ployed had not recovered their jobs. These dispari -
ties are not exclusive to Turkey. Overall, data from developing countries and advanced economies 
show that the labor market recession for high-wage 
workers has been shorter and milder (for instance, 
lasting only three months in the United States), 
whereas it is still weighing heavily on workers at the 
bottom of the income distribution.
For a robust and sustainable recovery, many 
voices are calling for a renewed emphasis on mak -
ing economies greener and knowledge- and tech -
nology-based in the post-pandemic era. The cur -
rent crisis also offers a great opportunity to tackle 
another long-standing critical challenge that is 
being exposed and further exacerbated by COVID-
19: rising inequality. 
The increase in poverty in Turkey could have 
been three times higher had the government not 
acted swiftly and decisively, implementing a num -
ber of mitigation policies such as increased social transfers, unemployment insurance benefits, and 
unpaid leave subsidies. The Turkish government’s FIGURE B1.3.2  Net job losses at the peak of the crisis across income deciles

pandemic mitigation efforts have been laudable 
and effective but addressing the growing inequali -
ties will require extra policy action. 
Among the most immediate challenges are to 
protect the livelihoods and human capital of dis -
advantaged households. With many individuals 
unable to find a job or work for enough hours, 
guaranteeing a minimum level of consumption 
requires extending the length and adequacy of 
benefits from the ongoing social assistance emer -
gency support. Priority should be given to urban self-employed workers—about a third of total 
employment and comprised mostly by unskilled 
workers in high-risk sectors—who are not covered 
by the wage support mechanisms that are part of 
the crisis response.
The impact of the crisis on education is a seri -
ous concern. According to the World Bank’s  
Europe and Central Asia Economic Update, Fall 
2020 , close to one learning-adjusted year of 
schooling will be wiped out in the region due to school closures. Most of these losses will be borne 
by children in low-income families weighed down 
by the digital divide. Only 6 percent of poor fami -
lies in Turkey own a computer and two in three poor households lack internet access. In addition 
BOX 1.3
to current strategies to strengthen distance learn -
ing, Turkey will have to step up investments in early 
childhood education and learning support to ease 
the transition back to school, close the learning 
gaps of poor children with their peers, and reduce the risk of massive dropouts. 
Finally, the conditions created by the pandemic 
will accelerate preexisting structural changes in the labor market, such as the shift to work from home 
and automation. These forces will weaken the 
demand for some types of labor, particularly low-skilled workers. In Turkey, about 10 percent of jobs can be performed from home, but the overwhelm -
ing majority of them are in sectors and occupations that are only suitable for higher-skilled workers. 
Upskilling, training, and other active labor inter -
ventions, many of which are currently implemented 
by the Turkish Employment Agency, will have to be sustained and deepened in a post-pandemic economy to avoid further widening of those gaps. 
It is not too late to change the course of global 
and regional inequality and make the recovery not only robust and sustainable, but also equitable. It is time now more than ever for trust, solidarity, and above all greater inclusiveness.

Turkey, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan are also among the few economies in the world 
that are estimated to have grown in 2020. However, the recovery in other ECA 
economies has been interrupted by a recent flare-up in COVID-19 cases. Further -
more, the rate of vaccine distribution across the region lags the acceleration in daily new cases, which could lead to disappointing regional growth outcomes. 
ECA’s EMDEs have experienced larger portfolio outflows relative to others 
since the early stages of the pandemic, reflecting a loss of investor confidence and 
a flight to safety (figure 1.6, panel A). These outflows reignited currency depre -
ciation and reserve losses. Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows also collapsed more severely in ECA compared with other EMDEs last year, with levels falling to a near 20-year low as large energy exporters, especially Russia, grappled with 
the decline in extractive investment (figure 1.6, panel B) (UNCTAD 2021b). De -
spite retreating somewhat since the onset of the pandemic, bond spreads are 22 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update Spring 2021
elevated relative to a year ago, and in some cases, they spiked again due to policy 
uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, or external financing pressures. Some ECA 
EMDEs subsequently faced external financing pressures, including from the col -
lapse in FDI inflows, but were partly able to offset these tensions by tapping into Eurobond markets and bilateral funding from Russia.
Monetary policy became more expansionary as economic conditions deterio-
rated in 2020. Several central banks intervened in foreign exchange markets to 
stabilize their currencies and mitigate volatility (Croatia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz 
Republic, Serbia, and Turkey), while others tapped sovereign wealth funds 
(Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan). Some countries have used unconventional poli -
cies, such as asset purchases (Croatia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Turkey) 
(figure 1.7, panel A). Recent currency depreciation and capacity constraints have 
put further upward pressure on inflation and reduced the scope for additional 
policy rate cuts, especially for countries with inflation near or above target ranges. 
Of the 17 ECA economies with stated inflation targets, nearly half reported head -
line inflation that exceeded the upper inflation band in early 2021 (figure 1.7, panel B). As a result of inflationary pressures, roughly a third of ECA’s economies 
were forced to abruptly hike policy interest rates in early 2021.
Fiscal support packages were announced in nearly all ECA economies, with 
several governments receiving aid from official sources, ramping up borrowing in debt markets, and prioritizing spending to bolster health care systems, 
strengthen safety nets, support the private sector, and counter financial market 
disruptions. Job retention and labor market support schemes were also imple -
mented to sustain employment. Although the average fiscal response has been larger in ECA than in most other EMDE regions, there is wide variation within FIGURE 1.6  Portfolio and FDI flows in ECA

actions or extended the previous temporary measures, while others are contem -
plating new legislation. However, many economies will not be able to maintain the level of expenditures needed to support the recovery in 2021–22, which 
could force some countries into premature fiscal tightening. In all, the fiscal

Regional Outlook
The economy of ECA is projected to expand by a moderate 3.6 percent in 2021, 
reflecting lingering disruptions to activity from an earlier resurgence of CO -
VID-19 and the emergence of more contagious variants of the virus (table 1.1; annex 1.1). Although this forecast is stronger than projected in January, the out -
look remains challenging due to a worsening of the pandemic, combined with tightening monetary policy as well as elevated policy uncertainty and geopoliti -
cal tensions. The strength and speed of the recovery will depend on the effective -
ness of pandemic management and the pace of vaccine deployment. Rollouts 
have proceeded in most of the region’s economies, as expected, but the number 
of doses administered remains low amid procurement challenges. 
Growth is expected to strengthen to 3.8 percent in 2022, as the economic effects 
of the pandemic gradually wane and the recovery in trade and investment gath -
ers momentum. Although growth is set to pick up in 2022, it is weaker than en -
visioned in January, reflecting tighter-than-expected macroeconomic policy and elevated policy uncertainty. As a result, per capita GDP is forecast to remain 2.9 
percent below pre-pandemic trends by 2022 (figure 1.8, panel A). The pandemic 
is also expected to exacerbate the slowdown in productivity growth over the long

After peaking in late December, the number of daily new COVID-19 cases more 
than halved in early 2021. Restrictions to slow the spread of the virus are ex -
pected to remain in place until a larger share of the population is vaccinated. Despite the rollout of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine in December, less than 5.4 per -
cent of the population had received a dose as of mid-March, reflecting a general reluctance to be immunized. Unless vaccine uptake accelerates, the Ministry of 
Health’s target of vaccinating 60 percent of adults by mid-2021 could remain a 
distant goal. Internationally, Sputnik V had been approved in about 50 countries 
as of mid-March. 
The contraction in output in 2020 was shallower than anticipated, with the 
Russian economy shrinking -3.1 percent compared with the January estimate of -4 percent (table 1.2). Despite high compliance with OPEC+ production cuts, in -

The COVID-19 pandemic has inflicted a severe 
human and economic toll in Europe and Central 
Asia (ECA), with millions of lives and jobs lost since 
the initial global spread of the virus in March 2020. 
The rollout of multiple effective COVID-19 vaccines, 
however, alongside social distancing measures is 
expected to help rein in the number of daily new 
COVID-19 cases. Widespread vaccination could 
allow for a gradual relaxation of pandemic-related 
restrictions, which would set the stage for a 
rebound in economic activity later this year. In con -
trast, the materialization of risks related to the pan -
demic—including delays in vaccine procurement, 
delivery, or administration—could dim the outlook. 
Against this backdrop, this box examines how 
the regional outlook will continue to be shaped by 
vaccine developments and risks, by addressing the 
following questions: 
• How are pandemic and vaccine trends evolv -
ing in ECA?
• What vaccine assumptions underpin the 
region’s near-term economic outlook?• What are the underlying vaccine risks and what impact could they have on the region’s 
near-term economic outlook? 
Recent pandemic and vaccine trends in ECA 
A sharp acceleration of COVID-19 infections that 
started in late 2020 forced several governments 
in ECA to reintroduce or extend social distanc -
ing measures into 2021. Although initially this appeared to have contributed to a steep fall in 
the number of daily new COVID-19 cases, several 
economies in the region are experiencing a flare-
up as authorities grapple with new, more transmis -
sible strains of the virus or as increases in mobility counteract restrictive measures (figure B1.4.1, pan -
els A and B). A recent rise in the rate of positive COVID-19 tests, particularly in Central Europe and 
the Western Balkans, suggests that the number of 
actual cases could be higher than confirmed by 
current testing capacity. 
Since the start of the year, COVID-19 deaths per 
capita in six ECA countries (Montenegro, Hungary, Vaccination assumptions and the COVID-19 pandemic:

highest death rates. Excess death statistics imply 
that the true rate could be far more devastating, 
with about half of the region’s economies experi -
encing double-digit increases in deaths relative to pre-pandemic years. The relatively high mortality 
rate partly reflects the region’s aging demograph -ics—the population share of individuals ages 65 
and older is larger in half of ECA’s economies than 
the world average.

(Continued next page)istered in the region is low, at about 6.6 doses per 
100 people, and the pace is highly uneven, with 
several ECA countries trailing the world average in 
mid-March (Albania, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakh -
stan, Moldova, Montenegro, and Ukraine) (figure B1.4.2, panel B). The low rate of vaccination partly 
reflects logistical challenges, including insufficient 
procurement and long delivery times (ECDC 2021). 
As a result, several governments have opted to 
prioritize frontline workers, the elderly, and other 
vulnerable groups, including those with underlying 
health issues. As doses become available, vaccine 
administration will be scaled up to include the gen -
eral population. 
Many economies in the region have secured 
advance agreements for vaccines produced by international pharmaceutical companies and other 
countries (Azerbaijan, Hungary, Serbia, and Tur -
key), while others plan to rely on the World Health 
Organization’s COVAX Facility. Of the 2.3 billion 
doses forecast to be rolled out globally in 2021 
through the COVAX Facility, roughly 165 million 
are destined for the broader geographical zone of 
Europe (Gavi 2021). However, vaccine distribution 
remains a challenge—vaccine procurement in ECA 
trails high-income Europe and falls short of the two 
doses per person that is needed for most COVID-
19 vaccines (figure B1.4.2, panel C).
Vaccine assumptions for the near-term 
economic outlook in ECA 
The regional outlook is predicated on a gradual 
rollout of vaccines in the first half of 2021, with 
vaccination gathering pace in the second half of 
the year in ECA’s largest economies. Meanwhile, 
widespread vaccine administration within other 
ECA EMDEs is anticipated to lag by at least one 
to two quarters, as several countries await ship -
ment from the COVAX Facility or face bottlenecks related to the production, procurement, or deliv -
ery of vaccines secured through other agreements (Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Western Balkans). Target inoculation goals vary, with some ECA EMDEs refraining from setting targets given 
procurement and uptake challenges, while sev -
eral economies in the European Union are aiming to vaccinate 70 percent of the adult population in 
2021 (ECDC 2021). Russia and Turkey, the region’s 
largest economies, have stated targets of 60 per -
cent of the adult population in 2021. Absent an acceleration in vaccine procurement and adminis -
tration, however, ECA is likely to fall behind the rest 
of Europe (figure B1.4.2, panel D). 
Differing vaccine timelines are expected to con -
tribute to an uneven economic recovery in ECA, 
with the countries that are rapidly deploying vac -
cines projected to recover at a faster clip in 2021 than those with slower vaccine administration 
(figure B1.4.3, panel A). In the latter group, activ -
ity is anticipated to be dampened by extended pandemic-related restrictions, which are likely to 
push the eventual recovery further into the forecast 
horizon, particularly for countries that rely heavily 
on international tourism. In all, upgrades to base -
line forecasts for 2021 are smaller in countries with slower vaccine progress (figure B1.4.3, panel B).
Underlying vaccine risks to the region’s 
near-term economic outlook
The highly uncertain evolution of the pandemic 
will continue to play a critical role in shaping the 
region’s outlook. Although vaccine rollouts have 
provided cautious optimism for the regional out -
look, a worsening of the recent flare-up in infection rates—alongside delays in vaccine procurement, 
delivery, and administration—could weaken or 
stall the recovery. Even with widespread vaccina -
tion of the adult population, the vaccines that are currently offered are not authorized for pediatric 
use, which, combined with vaccine reluctance, 
could hamper efforts to inoculate the population 
(Murray and Piot 2021). In contrast, progress in 
pandemic management, combined with improved 
vaccine procurement or administration, could lead Chapter 1: The Continuing COVID-19 Pandemic and the Economic Outlook  ● 29

measures and mask wearing. Relative to the base -

a higher proportion of the population to receive 
vaccines (figure B1.4.5, panel B). In turn, govern -
ments are forced to impose longer-lasting and more stringent pandemic control measures, which 
leads to a more subdued pace of recovery. Finan -
cial conditions tighten markedly through 2021, as financial market sentiment continuously deterio -
rates in tandem with a string of unexpected vac -
cine delays and insufficient control of the pan -
demic, and as corporate and bank balance sheets deteriorate over prolonged demand weakness and 
forbearance requirements. While accommodative 
monetary policy keeps financial crises at bay, fiscal 
sustainability concerns limit the size of additional 
fiscal stimulus, leading to insufficient income sup -
port to the unemployed and struggling small and medium-size firms. In this downside scenario, the 
projected economic recovery in ECA would reach only 2.2 percent in 2021 and 1.1 percent in 2022, 
which are 1.4 and 2.7 percentage points lower 
than the baseline forecasts for 2021 and 2022, 
respectively. In the upside scenario, economic activity 
resumes in the near term amid more effective man -
agement of COVID-19 variants coupled with rapid 
deployment of highly effective vaccines, allowing 
countries to meet upper target inoculation rates of 
around 70 percent of adults. Relative to the base -
line, vaccine administration rapidly accelerates and widespread immunization is achieved across and 
within ECA’s economies in 2021. Widespread pub -
lic education campaigns facilitate greater public compliance with pandemic control policies, as well 
as ameliorate vaccine reluctance, allowing econo -
mies to roll back stringent containment measures. As social distancing eases and businesses resume, 
employment is anticipated to lift while investor con -
fidence improves, which should bolster a rebound in domestic demand. In this upside scenario, the 
projected economic recovery in ECA would rise to 4.2 percent in 2021 and 5.2 percent in 2022, or 0.6 
and 1.3 percentage points higher than the baseline 
forecasts for 2021 and 2022, respectively. FIGURE B1.4.5  Risks to the ECA outlook

opted for targeted rather than economywide lockdowns. Additionally, the econ -
omy was aided by firming oil prices and accommodative macroeconomic policy. 
Still, the acceleration of new COVID-19 cases stalled the recovery in the fourth 
quarter of 2020, with the Manufacturing PMI and Services PMI slipping back into 
contraction.
Growth in Russia is envisioned to pick up only modestly in 2021, to 2.9 per -

was increased from a record low in late March amid a recent rise in inflation. As

Turkey
A sharp resurgence of COVID-19 gripped the Turkish economy in late 2020, with 
the rapid acceleration leading to the imposition of strict curfews and weekend 
lockdowns. These measures were kept in place for most of the first quarter of 
2021, which helped stem the spread of the virus, with daily new cases falling to 
less than a fifth of the December peak. As discussed in box 1.3, however, the 
spread of new variants has coincided with a flare-up in daily new cases. Turkey 
began a mass vaccination campaign in mid-January, with nearly 14.4 doses ad -
ministered per 100 people by mid-March, largely with the Chinese Sinovac vac -
cine, and plans to distribute the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Authorities are aiming 
to vaccinate 60 percent of the adult population in 2021.
Turkey’s economy avoided a contraction in 2020, with activity growing at a 
higher-than-expected 1.8 percent amid a substantial expansion in credit. The strength of the rebound was robust, with industrial production and retail sales 
rising above their pre-pandemic levels by the third quarter of 2020 and the Manu -
facturing PMI pointing to continued expansion in 2021. Despite substantial hikes in the policy interest rate, headline and core inflation continue to accelerate, limit -
ing the space available for countercyclical policy responses. However, tighter monetary policy appeared to rebuild market confidence initially, with the Turk -
ish lira partly recovering earlier losses against the U.S. dollar by early 2021. In late 
March, however, markets were roiled by the sudden departure of the central 
bank governor, which triggered about a 15 percent fall in the Turkish lira in the 
hours after the announcement. 
Growth is projected to rise to 5 percent in 2021, as exports benefit from firming 
external demand from neighboring euro area. The recovery is then set to moder -
ate to 4.5 percent in 2022, with activity supported by a gradual pick up in domes -
tic demand. The pace of recovery, combined with the earlier expansion in 2020, is 
expected to help buoy income relative to the regional average. Per capita GDP in 
Turkey is among the few countries in the world where the forecast exceeds pre-pandemic projections, with projections 0.4 percent higher by 2022—but the head -
line data mask growing inequalities, as discussed in box 1.3. Nevertheless, the outlook faces headwinds, including an acceleration in new COVID-19 cases, 
weak international tourism, and elevated policy uncertainty.
Central Europe
Central Europe suffered a severe resurgence of the virus in the fourth quarter of 
2020, which was exacerbated by new, more transmissible variants of COVID-19 
and pressures on health care systems. Although the number of cases fell sharply Chapter 1: The Continuing COVID-19 Pandemic and the Economic Outlook  ● 33
in early 2021—by about 80 percent from the November peak—signs are emerging 
that daily new cases are once again on the rise. The rate of positive tests also re -
mains elevated, implying that cases are likely higher than captured by official statistics. Central Europe has been one of the hardest hit ECA subregions in terms 
of deaths per capita, with Bulgaria, Croatia, and Hungary among the 10 EMDEs 
with the highest COVID-19 death rates in the world. Vaccine rollout began in 
December, but the pace of administration has been uneven—ranging from 5 
doses per 100 people (Bulgaria) to more than 19 doses per 100 people (Hungary), 
owing in part to vaccine import delays and general reluctance. 
Output in Central Europe is estimated to have contracted -3.6 percent in 2020, 
with many countries facing renewed weakness, especially in services and tour -
ism, due to a resurgence of COVID-19. Despite these drags, the economy firmed 
in the second half of last year, benefiting from resilience in the euro area. The 
improvement in external demand bolstered goods exports and industrial activity, 
with the latter exceeding its pre-pandemic level in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Despite challenges related to the pandemic, the Manufacturing PMI points to 
expansion in early 2021. 
Growth in Central Europe is envisioned to firm to 3.6 percent in 2021 and rise 
to 4.1 percent in 2022, supported by the recovery in trade as activity improves in the euro area. The outlook in 2021 remains challenging, however, as the recent 
surge in COVID-19 cases dampened the recovery at the start of the year. Excep-
tional policy accommodation is expected to continue throughout 2021, including 
near-zero policy interest rates (Hungary and Poland). By 2022, GDP per capita is 
expected to remain 5.2 percent below pre-pandemic projections. Among the ECA 
subregions, fiscal support packages have been largest in Central Europe, at 9 
percent of GDP , reflecting sizable discretionary measures and loan guarantees 
and other credit measures. The European Union’s structural fund package to 
Central Europe as part of its COVID-19 response could help support medium-term growth. 
Western Balkans 
Economies in the Western Balkans suffered from one of the sharpest resurgences of the virus in ECA heading into 2021, with the peak number of daily new cases 
far outstripping the regional average. Similar to Central Europe, three Western 
Balkan economies (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and North Macedo -
nia) are among the 10 EMDEs with the highest numbers of COVID-19 deaths per capita—putting further strain on the health care systems. For most economies in 
the Western Balkans, widespread vaccine rollout is not anticipated to begin until 
the second quarter of 2021—slower than initially anticipated—as countries await 
the delivery of vaccines via the World Health Organization’s COVAX Facility. 
Vaccine delivery has been roiled by manufacturing and import delays. Serbia is an exception and began vaccinating in late December, administering 24 doses per 
100 people as of mid-March—far outpacing the regional and global averages. 
Growth in the Western Balkans is expected to rebound to 4.4 percent in 2021 
and to moderate to 3.7 percent in 2022, assuming that consumer and business 
confidence is restored as COVID-19 is brought under control and that political 34 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update Spring 2021
instability eases. Despite this improvement, per capita income is anticipated to 
remain 6.5 percent below pre-pandemic projections by 2022. Tourism-dependent 
economies, particularly Albania and Montenegro, will continue to grapple with 
international travel restrictions. Rising fiscal liabilities in the subregion have re -
duced space for fiscal support and contributed to macroeconomic imbalances. At the same time, government budgets will be further stretched by the additional 
spending necessary to counter the damaging economic effects of the COVID-19 
outbreak. 
Despite these headwinds, medium-term growth and productivity in Albania 
and North Macedonia should be boosted by accelerating structural reforms in preparation for EU membership, assuming negotiations surrounding the acces -
sion process are not further delayed (Rovo 2020). The subregion is also expected to benefit from the EU’s recently adopted Economic and Investment Plan, which 
will mobilize funding to support sustainable connectivity, human capital, com -
petitiveness and inclusive growth, and green and digital transition.
South Caucasus 
Similar to other ECA subregions, the number of daily new cases in the South 
Caucasus surged again in the fourth quarter of 2020. Georgia suffered the most 
severe outbreak, with per capita cases rising at roughly three times the peak rate 
in Armenia and Azerbaijan. However, Armenia faces the highest cumulative 
deaths per capita in the South Caucasus—it is also the only country that did not 
enter into a second lockdown amid the late-2020 resurgence. Vaccine rollouts 
have been hampered in the South Caucasus due to procurement delays, but 
Azerbaijan initiated its immunization campaign in February amid the delivery of 
Sinovac vaccines. Although widespread progress has been slow, agreements with 
the United Kingdom’s pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and with Russia for Sputnik V could help jumpstart vaccinations later this year. High vaccine re-
luctance, particularly in Georgia, could hinder broader vaccination efforts. 
After suffering the sharpest collapse among the ECA subregions in 2020 amid 
armed conflict and high COVID-19 infection and fatality rates, growth in the 
South Caucasus subregion is projected to rise to 3.1 percent in 2021 and to acceler -
ate to 4.2 percent in 2022. The recovery at the start of 2021 remains muted, how -
ever, reflecting subdued domestic demand due to the pandemic, as well as an 
escalation in domestic political tensions (Armenia) and continued weakness in 
transport and tourism (Georgia). Monetary policy also became tighter, with Ar -
menia and Georgia hiking policy rates. In all, GDP per capita is expected to re -
main 7.0 percent below pre-pandemic forecasts by 2022. The outlook over the forecast horizon is predicated on the shocks related to the pandemic and conflict 
dissipating, and on a recovery in tourism alongside improving consumer and 
business confidence. Activity is expected to expand in Azerbaijan over the fore -
cast horizon as oil prices stabilize and the economy benefits from investment and reconstruction spending. The ceasefire agreement between Armenia and Azer -
baijan is expected to help alleviate geopolitical tensions in the region, although risks to stability remain. Chapter 1: The Continuing COVID-19 Pandemic and the Economic Outlook  ● 35
Eastern Europe
Daily new COVID-19 infections accelerated toward the start of 2021 but eased in 
the first quarter of 2021 in Eastern Europe. Cases have been rising rapidly once 
again, however, forcing the extension of COVID-19 restrictions in some coun -
tries. Belarus began administering doses of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine in Decem -
ber and aims to inoculate more than 10 percent of its population by the second 
quarter of 2021. The rollout in Eastern Europe has been slow, however, as these 
economies struggle to procure doses or are stalled by shipment delays. Despite 
these bottlenecks, Ukraine is aiming to vaccinate a third of its adult population 
by the end of 2021, and Moldova has indicated it plans to procure enough doses 
to cover 20 percent of its population. 
The economy in Eastern Europe contracted -3.3 percent in 2020, reflecting the 
dual shock of COVID-19 and an escalation of geopolitical tensions. Despite these headwinds, the recovery in Ukraine—the subregion’s largest economy—was 
more resilient than was anticipated, as the economy benefited from robust con -
struction and agricultural activity and firming retail sales in late 2020. However, monetary policy tightened in Ukraine in early 2021 amid a surge in inflation. 
Growth in Eastern Europe is projected to rise to a tepid 1.9 percent in 2021 and 
pick up to a modest 2.7 percent in 2022—the weakest of the ECA subregions. GDP 
per capita by 2022 is expected to remain 7.4 percent below pre-pandemic projec -
tions. The recovery is constrained by continued challenges related to the pan -
demic, heightened political tensions in Belarus, subdued domestic demand, and ongoing structural weakness. In particular, investment will continue to be damp -
ened amid weak investor sentiment, triggered in part by an earlier intensification of political tensions. 
Central Asia
In sharp contrast to the rest of ECA, the number of COVID-19 cases remains rela -
tively low in Central Asia. However, growing signs of acceleration in early 2021 
forced the extension of various restrictions in some economies to help mitigate 
pressures on the health care system. Kazakhstan, the subregion’s largest econ -
omy, began administering doses of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine in February and aims to inoculate a third of its population in 2021. Meanwhile, vaccination is ex -
pected to begin in March in Uzbekistan. For the rest of Central Asia, vaccine rollout is pending procurement and delivery of doses, mainly through the World 
Health Organization’s COVAX Facility.
In Central Asia, growth is expected to recover to 3.7 percent in 2021 and to 4.1 
percent in 2022—well below historical averages, with per capita income antici -
pated to remain 6.4 percent below pre-pandemic projections by 2022. The econ -
omy is anticipated to be supported by a modest rise in commodity prices, relax -
ation of OPEC+ production cuts (Kazakhstan), and firming FDI as the subregion 
deepens its integration with the rest of the world and with each other. In Uzbeki -
stan, growth should continue to benefit from the implementation of an ambitious reform agenda, which progressed last year despite formidable headwinds from 36 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update Spring 2021
the pandemic. However, the sub-regional rebound has been dampened by rising 
policy uncertainty in Central Asia, particularly in the Kyrgyz Republic, following 
political tensions and social unrest. Inflationary pressures have triggered more 
restrictive monetary policy in some countries, with the Kyrgyz Republic and Ta -
jikistan raising their key policy rates. 
Risks to the Regional Outlook
Risks to the outlook are markedly tilted to the downside, despite the positive progress with vaccine deployment across several ECA economies. The near-term 
growth outlook for ECA is clouded by the sharp rise in uncertainty over the surge 
in new cases, which contributed to social unrest in some countries, as well as the 
risk of geopolitical tensions re-escalating. Several euro area countries were forced 
to re-impose nationwide lockdowns, which may weaken near-term external de-
mand in ECA. Similarly, a persistently high number or increase in number of 
cases within ECA could lead to the extension of stringent restrictions and re -
sponses by households and firms, which would weigh on private consumption and investment. If the downturn in travel is prolonged, growth outcomes could be much weaker, particularly in tourism-dependent economies (Central Europe, 
Turkey, and the Western Balkans). Delays in the production, procurement, or dis -
tribution of COVID-19 vaccines, lower-than-expected vaccine effectiveness, the suspension of vaccines due to safety concerns, higher-than-expected vaccine re-
luctance, or the continuation of pandemic-related restrictions could also delay 
the economic recovery. The challenges of distribution and inoculation are par -
ticularly elevated in Central Asia, where health care capacity is weaker than in other parts ECA. 
The threat of premature fiscal consolidation also poses downside risks to the 
outlook, particularly in economies experiencing continued flare-ups of new CO -
VID-19 cases and ongoing social-distancing measures, as well as those depen -
dent on international tourism. Regional economies face the formidable policy challenge of balancing the need to place public debt on a sustainable path with 
that of supporting a durable and inclusive recovery. However, the optimal timing 
of withdrawing fiscal support will depend on country-specific conditions, in -
cluding those related to pandemic trends, macroeconomic space, and prevailing output gaps. 
In the context of capital outflows, foreign exchange reserves have been drawn 
down sharply in some ECA economies, constraining the capacity of central banks to buffer the impact of further negative external shocks. A sudden reassessment 
of investor sentiment could lead to cascading defaults and rising nonperforming 
loans, especially given the sharp increase in government debt. Despite excep -
tional liquidity support, corporate balance sheet pressures in ECA have contin -
ued to rise in the wake of COVID-19 due to lower earnings and substantial ex -
change rate depreciation, putting strain on the banking sector. For banks that are undercapitalized or operate in countries with narrow fiscal space, regulatory 
forbearance has intensified stress (see box 1.1). The pandemic has also amplified the risk that contingent liabilities will be realized, which could further strain pub -
lic finances. Chapter 1: The Continuing COVID-19 Pandemic and the Economic Outlook  ● 37
The pandemic poses medium-term risks if protracted spells of unemployment 
and school closures have a significant impact on human capital development 
through lost opportunities to acquire skills and gain knowledge (Dieppe 2020; 
Shmis et al. 2020; World Bank 2020c). Renewed school closures in response to a 
worsening of the pandemic would exacerbate these risks. Investment prospects 
have eroded further in response to the slowdown in capital expenditures, with 
the exception of Central Europe. The sizable EU structural funds package to Cen -
tral Europe as part of its COVID-19 response could help mitigate the weakness in investment, but the boost could be tempered by low absorption of funds due to 
challenges surrounding administrative capacity and governance. 
Renewed geopolitical tensions in ECA would also present headwinds to 
growth. Eventual unraveling of the ceasefire agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan, further political pressures in Belarus or the Kyrgyz Republic, or re -
newed involvement by the region’s largest economies in conflicts in Libya, the Syrian Arab Republic, or Ukraine could trigger additional sanctions and generate 
substantial financial market pressures. Disagreements between the EU and other 
major economies, such as China, could also lead to additional sanctions that have 
implications for some ECA countries. A rise in policy uncertainty, particularly in 
some of the region’s large economies, could also undermine the recovery if it triggers financial stress. A protracted deterioration in investor sentiment—
whether from uncertainty related to the pandemic, geopolitical tensions, policy 
uncertainty, or delays in EU accession negotiations—could have material impli -
cations for ECA and erode the outlook.
Long-Term Challenges and Policies
The COVID-19 crisis has left scarring effects on EMDEs in ECA due to the erosion of human capital following significant disruptions to education and health. Despite prog -
ress in institutional reforms over the past decade, longstanding bottlenecks to inclusive, sustainable growth—including weak governance, a high perception of corruption, and 
obstacles to competition—continue to restrain productivity in the region. However, un -
precedented government support packages provide a rare opportunity for green invest -
ment, which could facilitate the transition to a low-carbon future and yield sustainable 
growth dividends. Policy makers can also seize the opportunity to lay the foundations for 
a durable, equitable, and sustainable recovery, including through achieving progress on 
longstanding structural reforms and leveraging digital progress.
Boosting Human Capital and Reversing COVID-19 Damage
The COVID-19 pandemic has gripped the world and is expected to roll back years of hard-won improvements in human capital, including in ECA, as high -
lighted in the Europe and Central Asia Economic Update, Fall 2020  (World Bank 
2020e). Even before the pandemic, the average newborn in ECA could only be 
expected to achieve 69 percent of her potential productivity as a future worker 
(World Bank 2020h). Already over the past decade, all fundamental drivers of 
growth—investment, productivity growth, improvements in education and 38 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update Spring 2021
health, and working-age population growth—had slowed (Dieppe 2020). Absent 
effective policy action or major technological advances, it is expected that the 
pandemic will further slow potential growth in ECA (figure 1.9, panel A) (World 
Bank 2021). 
Counting the costs. The pandemic has disrupted education for 90 percent of the 
world’s children, including those in ECA (World Bank 2020c). In quality-adjusted 
terms, the pandemic could lower average years of schooling by 0.3 to 1.1 years in 
ECA—the steepest decline among EMDE regions—which, combined with the 
deskilling associated with prolonged unemployment, could lead to sizable future 
earnings losses (Azevedo et al. 2020; Fasih, Patrinos, and Shafiq 2020). 
By 2040, about one-third of the world’s workforce will be composed of indi -
viduals whose schooling was disrupted by the pandemic and, on average, the human capital of the global workforce would be almost one Human Capital In -
dex point lower—equivalent to 1 percent below potential productivity—than in the absence of the pandemic (World Bank 2020h). Additionally, the global unem -
ployment rate increased by about 2 percentage points in the first half of 2020 alone. In Europe, COVID-19 triggered the equivalent of a loss of 30 million full-
time jobs in 2020, with seven to 22 million jobs at risk in 2021, depending on 
pandemic assumptions (ILO 2021). The longer unemployment remains high, the more pronounced the associated human capital losses will be. 
Beyond educational costs, long term health impacts of the pandemic may be 
expected. Reduced lung function among COVID-19 survivors—which can repre -
sent a substantial part of the workforce in the worst hit countries—may impact productivity for several years. The disruption of health care services is

A. GDP-weighted averages (at 2010 prices and exchange rates). Potential growth estimates are based on a production function approach as de -
scribed in Kilic Celik, Kose, and Ohnsorge (2020). Pre-COVID prospects for the 2020s assume that investment grows at its historical average rate, working-age population and life expectancy evolve as envisaged by the UN Population Projections; and secondary and tertiary school enrollment 
and completion rates improve at their historical average rate. Post-COVID estimates for the 2020s assume that investment grows as expected by 
Consensus forecasts, working-age population and life expectancy evolve as envisaged by the UN Population Projects, and secondary attainment rates decline by 2.5 percentage points.

particularly concerning for child and maternal health. If immunizations are not 
provided after the pandemic, decreases could leave cohorts of children without 
full immunization and therefore more exposed to preventable infectious diseases 
in the future. Disruption of health care provision can also adversely affect adult 
health if, for instance, regular preventive screenings for noncommunicable dis -
eases are skipped or postponed for too long.
Ensuring access to education. Safeguarding access to education is critical for 
promoting better long-run growth outcomes (Sala-i-Martin, Doppelhofer, and Miller 2004). Increased investment in infrastructure related to education can im -
prove the quantity and quality of human capital (Francisco and Tanaka 2020; 
Barrett et al. 2019). The short-term challenge is a safe reopening of schools and 
keeping students, especially girls because they are at greater risk of dropping out, 
in school, while the long-term challenge is to reverse some of the pandemic-re -
lated losses in learning outcomes.
3 
Long-term improvements start with better measurement of the outcomes in 
education to help target interventions more effectively (World Bank 2019a). School meals programs and early childhood interventions can help better pre -
pare students for learning. To strengthen pedagogical effectiveness, teachers can be supported with coaching, motivated by incentives, and provided appropriate 
technologies. The dividends could be large—going from a low-performing teacher 
to a high-performing teacher can increase student learning by multiple years.
4 
Community and parental support will also be critical to improve learning. 
The COVID-19 crisis underscores the critical need for investment in digital 
skills and technology to ensure educational continuity, as well as for resources to 
upgrade information and communications technology infrastructure to support 
virtual learning, particularly for more vulnerable households. Digital approaches 
to remote learning that have been developed during the pandemic can be lever -
aged gradually to broaden access to affordable education across EMDEs, includ -
ing those in ECA, over the long term (Li and Lalani 2020). In ECA, there is wide 
divergence in internet access, with some EU members having rates similar to those in euro area countries, while Central Asia lags even the EMDE average 
(figure 1.9, panel B). This could heighten educational inequalities between coun-
tries that offer remote learning and those that cannot, and within countries be -
tween children with private tutors and remote learning and those without (Vegas and Winthrop 2020).
Improving educational outcomes . Although ECA fares well relative to other EM -
DEs in higher educational attainment, reforms to increase educational outcomes, 
as well as vocational programs, could improve labor market outcomes (EBRD 
2020). To be competitive in the global market, students will need to be equipped with in-demand skills for the future of work and remain productive in rapidly 
changing economies ( Europe and Central Asia Economic Update, Fall 2020 ; WEF

2021).5 Curricula should be aligned to increase employability and reduce skills 
gaps and mismatches to ensure that students are prepared for the dynamic na -
ture of the labor market and changing needs of employers.6 
In a few economies in ECA, particularly in Central Asia, inadequate invest -
ment in human capital left parts of the workforce poorly equipped for rapid tech -
nological change even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (Flabbi and Gatti 2018). 
Low educational attainment among the workforce and inadequate skills are often 
cited as constraints for doing business, firm growth, job creation, and innovation 
in ECA (Brancatelli, Marguerie, and Brodmann 2020; World Bank 2019b). An ag -
ing workforce, a declining working-age population share, and high emigration rates among young and skilled workers in ECA highlight the need for education to help 
workers adapt to new job requirements and technologies (Aiyar, Ebeke, and Shao 2016; Hallward-Driemeier and Nayyar 2018; World Bank 2018). Beyond formal edu -
cation, access to retraining programs for workers in the hardest hit sectors—whether from the pandemic or automation—can facilitate their re-employment. 
On the health front, the pandemic has laid bare the need to detect rapidly and 
respond to public health emergencies (World Bank 2020g). Aging populations in 
the region and the greater vulnerability of the elderly to many infectious diseases 
make this an even greater priority. Addressing and minimizing the health risks of 
high rates of obesity, smoking, and heavy drinking in the region are also important, 
not only for limiting the impact of noncommunicable diseases, but also for mini -
mizing the loss of lives associated with major outbreaks of infectious diseases.
Strengthening Institutions
Strong institutions and conducive business climates can set the stage for vigorous growth. Institutions can promote forms of economic activity that are associated 
with greater economic complexity and higher productivity growth by encourag -
ing human capital accumulation and innovative activities (Dieppe 2020; Vu 2019). A distinguishing feature of ECA is the large state presence in the economy, 
which partly reflects an incomplete transition process. Even in the decade prior 
to COVID-19, the state’s footprint was increasing (EBRD 2020). The pandemic has 
exacerbated this trend, as governments have been forced to intervene with large-
scale macroeconomic support packages to help counter the downturn and protect 
lives and livelihoods. Given the large and growing role of the state in ECA, reforms that strengthen institutions are key to improve development outcomes. 
Improving governance. Good governance ensures competitive and flexible mar -
kets with limited market concentration, effective regulation, and the efficient and 
equitable provision of public services, including health care, education, and pub -
lic infrastructure (Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson 2005; Dort, Méon, and Sek-kat 2014; Gwartney, Holcombe, and Lawson 2006). Improvements in governance, 
especially to emphasize accountability, can promote trust in government (World 
Bank 2017). The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the importance of public trust 
and credibility—there is early evidence that compliance with pandemic control

measures has been greater in countries and subnational entities with stronger 
trust in government (see box 1.2 and Devine et al. (2020)). 
Strengthening institutions. Weak institutions and governance remain an obsta-
cle to sustained, robust growth of investment and productivity in ECA, under -
scoring the potential benefits of reforms in these areas (World Bank 2018, 2020f). Pervasive corruption and crime, weak administrative capacity, and informality 
are formidable constraints on the ability of private firms to invest, innovate, and 
close the productivity gap with high-income countries. Thus, there is consider -
able scope for governments to stem or reverse a slowdown in productivity and potential growth by strengthening institutions and reducing corruption (Kilic Celik, Kose, and Ohnsorge 2020). Major reform initiatives to improve business 
climates or governance have been followed by significantly higher total factor 
productivity growth in the near term and investment growth in the medium term 
(figure 1.10, panel A). In contrast, reform setbacks have often been associated 
with slowdowns in total factor productivity growth that set in early and were not 
reversed over the subsequent five years. 
Reducing corruption.  Good governance also requires control of corruption. 
While progress has been made in reducing corruption over the past decade, there 
have been setbacks in some countries, including those in ECA (figure 1.10, panel B). Over 30 percent of firms in EMDEs identify corruption and competition from 
the informal sector as major constraints to their growth. Among the EMDE re -
gions, the perception of corruption is second highest in ECA only after Sub-Saha -
ran Africa (Corruption Perceptions Index, 2021). Survey data suggest that the 
perception of democracy has deteriorated further since the COVID-19 crisis be -
gan, particularly in countries facing rising social unrest and other geopolitical tensions (Freedom House 2021).

Reducing corruption is paramount in light of the expansion of government 
activity induced by the pandemic (World Bank 2020d). Addressing corruption 
can play a crucial role in bolstering the recovery and improving the effectiveness 
of resource allocation over the longer run (Avellan, Galindo, and Leon-Diaz 
2020).7 Fostering a more predictable investment climate can help countries attract 
FDI, seize new trade opportunities brought on by ongoing global value chain reconfiguration, and address balance of payments difficulties (World Bank 2020i). 
Reducing corruption can also help increase the quality of government expenditures, 
the effectiveness of social benefit systems, and, by boosting government revenues, 
the amount of fiscal space (Peisakhin and Pinto 2010). 
Promoting digitalization.  Promoting digitalization can have many cross-cutting 
benefits, including strengthening and improving governance.  A prerequisite for 
meaningful digital connectivity—internet coverage—remains highly uneven across and within ECA countries—and even within countries in Central Europe, access is far less prevalent in small towns and rural areas. This digital divide 
hinders opportunities for remote work and virtual learning, which could further 
reverse human capital gains and exacerbate inequality. An expansion of broad -
band and mobile internet access would enable a larger share of the population to access digital services, which could improve connectivity in ECA’s low-density 
areas (EBRD 2020). 
Importantly, digital technology and the data revolution offer the potential to 
increase efficiency, transparency, responsiveness, and citizen trust, directly im -
pacting government quality. Part 2 of this Update takes a closer look at how digi -
tal tools and GovTech can optimize management, service delivery, and overall state capacity in ECA countries. It assesses the extent to which countries in the 
region exploit data and digitalization and includes specific policy recommenda -
tions for harnessing the data revolution to improve governance across ECA. 
Good governance is necessary, but it takes time to improve and will not be 
sufficient to address the challenges faced by ECA governments, since structural transformation requires adequate resources. Unfortunately, the pressing need for 
COVID-19 support and subsequent collapse in activity has triggered a spike in 
government debt and exhausted fiscal space for many countries. To this end, as efforts to improve governance continue, it will be important to target reforms that 
boost inclusive and sustainable growth, reverse the losses in human capital ac -
cumulation, bolster domestic revenue mobilization, and strengthen the public expenditure review process. These will set the stage for a robust recovery and 
medium-term growth, as well as place debt on a more sustainable footing.
Enabling Markets and Fostering Competition 
EMDEs with business-friendly regulations tend to have higher levels of eco -
nomic inclusiveness, have smaller informal sectors, and grow faster (Djankov, 
7. Several studies show that anticorruption reforms have significantly boosted long-term 
growth and investment, albeit with substantial variation in outcomes across countries (Cieślik and Goczek 2018; de Vaal and Ebben 2011; Gründler and Potrafke 2019; Hodge et al. 2011; OECD 2015; Shleifer and Vishny 1993).Chapter 1: The Continuing COVID-19 Pandemic and the Economic Outlook  ● 43
McLiesh, and Ramalho 2006; World Bank 2014). Major improvements in business 
environments have been associated with increased output growth as the im -
provements encourage the entry of more productive firms, including multina -
tional companies, and stimulate spending on research and development (R&D) 
(Alam, Uddin, and Yazdifar 2019; Divanbeigi and Ramalho 2015; Egan 2013; 
Kirkpatrick 2014). However, weak business environments may diminish the 
complementarities between public and foreign direct investment and domestic 
investment (Topalova and Khandelwal 2011). 
Although legacies from centrally planned economies are still evident, several 
ECA countries have made progress over the past decade in facilitating competi -
tion and undertaking structural transformation, with notable improvement in 
Central Asia as well as Azerbaijan and Turkey (EBRD 2020). A handful of coun -
tries in ECA, particularly in Central Asia, have implemented reforms to facilitate the ease of doing business, particularly for small and medium-size enterprises 
(EBRD 2020). These reforms include tax code changes, reductions in regulatory 
burdens, and measures that encourage fair competition and innovation. Mean -
while, some countries have recently adopted reforms to open up agriculture, which should help attract investment and support the expansion of private en -
terprise in agriculture sectors (Ukraine and Uzbekistan). Still, further institu -
tional reforms can be adopted to enable markets, foster competition, and bolster economic growth (Bluhm and Szirmai 2011; Nawaz 2015; Prati, Onorato, and 
Papageorgiou 2013).
8 In Romania, competition is hampered by regulations that 
restrict entry and rivalry, particularly in retail trade, while measures to promote 
competition neutrality to ensure fair market access of public enterprises and pri -
vate firms are largely absent.9
The pandemic has pushed firms, including those in ECA, to rely increasingly 
on digital solutions to remain in the market (Apedoh-Amah et al. 2020). Digitali -
zation has been associated with higher firm-level productivity (Cusolita, Leder -
man, and Pena 2020). In light of social distancing measures, the use of online payment systems and other forms of cashless payments as well as online com -
merce has expanded rapidly (Barrero, Bloom, and Davis 2020; Kenney and Zys -
man 2020). Even beyond the pandemic, digitalization can facilitate job search, 
accelerate the discovery of new job opportunities, and increase employment (El-
Mallakh 2020; Hjort and Poulsen 2019; Viollaz and Winkler 2020). It can also re -
duce uncertainty and information asymmetries in product markets (World Bank 
2019c). And in addition to its productivity-enhancing effects, wider internet ac -
cess has been found to increase female labor force participation (Viollaz and Win -
kler 2020). 
8. Market-friendly reforms have been shown to strengthen the underlying drivers of 
growth by dismantling regulatory barriers to doing business and entrepreneurship, and by removing obstacles to innovation and entrepreneurship, openness, competition, and finan-cial development (Kilic Celik, Kose, and Ohnsorge 2020; Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson 2005; Botero, Ponce, and Shleifer 2012; Glaeser et al. 2004; Glaeser, Ponzetto, and Shleifer 2007).9. https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentde -

Facilitating the Green Transition
Building green objectives into COVID-19 recovery packages will increase resilience 
to future shocks as well as reduce risks. Green stimulus packages, including ef -
forts to improve energy efficiency such as retrofitting buildings, can have large fiscal multipliers as they are labor intensive and productivity enhancing (Agrawala, 
Dussaux, and Monti 2020; IEA 2020). Effective policies in the short term include clean 
physical infrastructure, efficiency retrofits, investment in education and training, 
natural capital investment, and clean R&D; in lower- and middle-income countries, 
rural support spending can be effective (Hepburn et al. 2020). Energy efficiency, 
nature conservation, clean energy options, and the sustainability of transport are 
also priority areas for stimulus investments (Hallegatte and Hammer 2020).
Addressing the gaps between current spending on infrastructure and the level 
needed to meet the Sustainable Development Goals can contribute to a sustained rise in per capita incomes (Canning and Pedroni 2008; Rozenberg and Fay 2019). 
Prioritizing investment in green infrastructure projects with high economic re -
turns and fostering the widespread adoption of environmentally sustainable technologies can support higher growth levels in the long run while also contrib -
uting to climate change mitigation (OECD 2020; Strand and Toman 2010).
Building resilience to the risks posed by climate change—including higher 
frequency of severe storms and droughts, rising sea levels, and lower crop 
yields—is critical in ECA given the region’s large presence of agricultural export -
ers and numerous coastal populations (World Bank 2019a). More than 80 percent of farmland is expected to be depleted from decreased rainfall in the coming 
decades (European Environmental Agency 2019). The cost of investing in resil -
ient infrastructure can be balanced by targeting measures that provide jobs quickly, such as anti-drought technology, landscape and watershed manage -
ment, ecosystem restoration, and sustainable management of forests (World Bank 2020b; Hallegatte, Rentschler, and Rozenberg 2019).
For many EMDEs, investing in renewable energy can increase energy security 
while reducing reliance on energy imports. It can also ease the fiscal burden of energy subsidies, which are quite high in ECA, averaging over 3 percent of GDP 
in 2019 (IEA 2020). To date, fiscal stimulus in G20 countries to combat the pan -
demic has benefited carbon-intensive and environmentally friendlier activities (VFDI 2020). Among G20 members, including those in ECA, energy support has 
mainly gone to carbon-intensive activities (figure 1.11, panel A). The transition to 
low-carbon energy is expected to generate government revenue shortfalls absent 
reforms to energy use and pricing policies (figure 1.11, panel B). In addition, the 
social and economic consequences of green policies need to be carefully man -
aged—particularly job losses in traditional energy industries.
Despite these challenges, the EU Green Deal—which aims for the EU to be 
climate neutral by 2050—has the potential to boost the green transition by desig -
nating portions of EU funds to prioritize climate-friendly projects in all sectors. The alignment of EU initiatives towards ambitious green goals means that ECA 
countries will be increasingly incentivized to support green transition through 
the large amount of EU structural funds typically disbursed in ECA and through 
the EU Eastern Partnership.Chapter 1: The Continuing COVID-19 Pandemic and the Economic Outlook  ● 45
Annex 1.1 Data and Forecast Conventions
The macroeconomic forecasts presented in this Update are the result of an itera -
tive process involving staff from the World Bank Prospects Group in the Equita -
ble Growth, Finance, and Institutions Vice-Presidency; country teams; regional 
and country offices; and the Europe and Central Asia Chief Economist’s office. 
This process incorporates data, macroeconometric models, and judgment. 
Data
The data used to prepare the country forecasts come from a variety of sources. 
National income accounts, balance of payments, and fiscal data are from Haver 
Analytics; the World Bank’s World Development Indicators; and the Interna -
tional Monetary Fund’s (IMF’s) World Economic Outlook, Balance of Payments Statistics, and International Financial Statistics. Population data and forecasts are 
from the United Nations’ World Population Prospects. Country and lending 
group classifications are from the World Bank. In-house databases include com -
modity prices, data on previous forecast vintages, and country classifications. Other internal databases include high-frequency indicators—such as industrial 
production, consumer price indexes, housing prices, exchange rates, exports, im -
ports, and stock market indexes—based on data from Bloomberg, Haver Analyt -
ics, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s analytical hous -
ing price indicators, the IMF’s Balance of Payments Statistics, and the IMF’s 
International Financial Statistics. Aggregate growth for the world and all subgroups 
of countries (such as regions and income groups) is calculated as the gross domestic 
product–weighted average (in 2010 prices) of country-specific growth rates. Income 
groups are defined as in the World Bank’s classification of country groups. FIGURE 1.11  Green recovery

Forecast Process
The process starts with initial assumptions about advanced economy growth and 
commodity price forecasts. These assumptions are used as conditions for the first 
set of growth forecasts for emerging markets and developing economies, which 
are produced using macroeconometric models, accounting frameworks to ensure 
national accounts identities and global consistency, estimates of spillovers from 
major economies, and high-frequency indicators. These forecasts are then evalu-
ated to ensure consistency of treatment across similar economies. This process is 
followed by extensive discussions with World Bank country teams, which con -
duct continuous macroeconomic monitoring and dialogue with country authori -
ties. Throughout the forecasting process, staff use macroeconometric models that allow the combination of judgment and consistency with model-based insights.

51Thirty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the process of transformation continues in 
Europe and Central Asia (ECA). Governments in the region have made strides in devel -
oping their economies through structural reforms and investments in education and healthcare. The quality of government has increasingly come to be seen as the central 
mediator of economic development. Public policy shapes the nature of development 
through both its actions and inactions. Countries’ fates depend on their governance—a 
fact that the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored. 
Governments play a critical role in determining the productivity of ECA econo -
mies, where government expenditures account for almost 40 percent of GDP and 
the public sector employs more than a quarter of the workforce. Given the scale 
of public sector employment in ECA, governments have considerable weight in 
influencing labor market standards through their policies. This significant role of 
the government underscores the importance of improving the quality of gover -
nance in ECA to effectively respond to the region’s economic and social challenges. 
Strengthening state capacity while improving citizen trust is a priority for 
governments across ECA. Digitalization and the data revolution can fundamen -
tally change the quality of government. Public administrations’ use of data is 
vital in catalyzing institutional evolution. As the costs of producing, analyzing, 
and aggregating data plummet, and the availability of analytically trained work-
ers increases, governments across the region are adopting and adapting data sys -
tems within their management and organizational models. To fully exploit the opportunities of the data revolution, governments must situate and coordinate 
their modernization within the unique nature of the public service.Data, Digitalization,  
and Governance52 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update Spring 2021
This report argues that the data revolution and digitalization are among the 
most practical and feasible approaches to improving governance in ECA. The use 
of information technologies in the public sector has been increasing exponen -
tially over the last three decades, penetrating all government sectors: from per -
sonal management systems to judiciary services. A large body of evidence reveals 
the positive impact of digitalization on government efficiency, accountability, 
control of corruption, and service delivery. 
By increasing transparency and the availability of information and reducing 
information asymmetry, the digital revolution was embraced by different politi -
cal regimes and by countries with different levels of economic development. The 
modernization of governments in ECA would also produce large externalities for 
the region and the world. The World Bank’s role is to help its client countries 
internalize such externalities and advise on addressing the social, political, orga -
nizational, and legal challenges of the transition from the “analog” to “digital” governance.  
Digitalization and the data revolution can also help strengthen linkages be -
tween governments and citizens. Transparency and availability of information 
pave the way for a societal paradigm shift. It reduces the information asymmetry 
between governments and ordinary citizens. The accessibility and sharing of in-formation are transforming governance models from hierarchical technocracies 
to open networked economies, creating opportunities for civil society and indi -
vidual citizens to hold governments accountable. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of digital technolo -
gies and highlighted the costs associated with delaying public sector moderniza -
tion. The crisis may catalyze advances in digitalization and the use of data by the 
public. 
This chapter proposes policy recommendations, grounded in empirical evi -
dence, for harnessing the data revolution to improve governance across ECA. They include the following: 
• Implement incentive structures to encourage the adoption and adaptation of data systems within the civil service.
• Expand the impact of the data revolution through coordination of decentral -
ized data systems across institutions.
• Foster platforms for citizens to hold government accountable.
• Redefine the firewall between societies and governments by experimenting with direct feedback between citizens and government. 
The chapter is organized as follows. The first section outlines the significant 
role of government in ECA countries and discusses the importance of good gov -
ernance in determining countries’ productivity and efficiency. The following sec -
tions describe the current conditions of data and digitalization for state capacity 
and for collaborative governance in ECA countries. They underscore the need for 
interoperability of data systems in government and civil society to achieve trans -
parency, data-fueled decision making, and accountability. The last section sum -
marizes the main conclusions and provides recommendations on using the data 
revolution to make governance and civil service management more effective. Chapter 2: Data, Digitalization, and Governance  ● 53
The Important Role of Government and 
Governance in Europe and Central Asia
With many countries still transitioning to market economies, the public sector plays a 
critical role in determining the productivity of economies in ECA. As the employer of 
more than a quarter of the region’s workers, particularly the more educated ones, govern -
ments in the region affect labor market standards through their policies and composition. Although the region as a whole is home to the highest-quality governance in the world, 
average figures conceal large subregional differences in the governance quality. Improv -
ing the quality of governance is critical if ECA is to respond to the economic and social challenges it faces.
The Role of Government in Europe and Central Asia
Government plays a critical role in determining the productivity of the econo -
mies of ECA. Government expenditures in the region account for 39 percent of 
GDP—a larger share than the world average of 33 percent. 
Across the world, government expenditure as a share of GDP increases with 
per capita income (figure 2.1). This correlation suggests that this share is likely to 
rise in ECA, as the region’s middle-income countries experience stronger growth 
in the coming years. 
Within ECA, the richest subregions (Northern, Southern, and Western Eu -
rope) spend more than 40 percent of their GDP on public expenditures; the poor -
est subregions (Central Asia and the South Caucasus) spend less than a third 
(figure 2.2).

Governments in ECA also play an outsized role in shaping labor markets. The 
public sector employs 86 million people (just over 25 percent of total employ -
ment), a significantly larger share than the global average of 16 percent.1 
The share of public sector employment in total employment (formal and infor -
mal) varies significantly across subregions. The Russian Federation and Eastern 
Europe have the largest shares (more than 30 percent of total employment), and 
the South Caucasus and Turkey have the smallest shares (no more than 20 per -
cent). State-owned enterprises account for at least 5 percent of total employment in Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe (Richmond and others 2019).
Given the large scale of public sector employment in ECA, governments have 
considerable weight in influencing labor market standards through their policies 
and compositions. The characteristics of public administration shape broader labor market trends (Hasnain and others 2019; Gindling, Mossaad, and Newhouse 2020). 
Public employment in the region attracts skilled labor: 54 percent of public 
sector employees in the region have tertiary education. This share is highest in 
the South Caucasus and Northern Europe (above 60 percent) and lowest in Cen -
tral Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Western Balkans (below 50 percent). Public sector employees are considerably more educated than the average person in the 
region, particularly in lower-income countries (figure 2.3). In the South Cauca -
sus, Central Asia, and Western Balkans, the share of the population with tertiary education is more than twice as large in the public sector as it is in the population at large.

Women make up about 57 percent of public sector paid employees in the re -
gion (table 2.1). In Northern Europe, 74 percent of public sector paid employees 
are women, the largest share in the region. Kosovo has the smallest share, at less 
than 34 percent. 
In all countries the share of female employees is larger in the public sector 
than in the private sector (figure 2.4), possibly because the female-to-male wage 
ratio is slightly higher in the public sector (0.783) than in the private sector (0.767)  
(Hasnain and others 2019). Turkey and the Western Balkans have the highest fe -
male-to-male public sector wage ratios within the region, and Western Europe 
and Central Asia have the lowest. 
Pay ratios in the private sector in the region suggest that the pay ratio is not 
the only factor behind the larger share of women among public employees, how -
ever. Among the 34 countries in the region for which the comparison can be 
made, female-to-male wage ratios are higher in the public sector than in the pri -
vate sector in 22 and lower in 12 countries (figure 2.5). The better complementar -
ity with family responsibilities and shorter work hours of public sector jobs may 
explain women’s preference for public employment in countries where women 
are still expected to perform most household tasks (World Bank 2012). 
The structure of wages in the public sector is relevant for various aspects of 
career development, including upward mobility, pay progression, and pay satis -
faction, as well as for competition for talent with the private sector. If, for exam -
ple, public sector workers receive significantly lower wages than their private sector counterparts, the supply of qualified personnel in the public sector may 
fall, adversely affecting the quality of publicly provided goods and services. FIGURE 2.3  Percent of

Conversely, high public sector wage premiums may crowd out pro-poor spend -
ing or increase youth unemployment (Gindling, Mossaad, and Newhouse 2019). 
They can also crowd out skilled employment in the private sector. 
In many countries in ECA, pensions and fringe benefits for top-level jobs are 
only slightly less generous in the private sector than in the public sector. The Chapter 2: Data, Digitalization, and Governance  ● 59
public sector also pays higher average wages than the private sector for employ -
ees with similar characteristics. These findings suggest that in the public sector, 
top talent is underpaid compared with lower-skilled labor, making it challenging 
to retain the best employees (Mizala, Romaguera, and Gallegos 2011; Gindling, 
Mossaad, and Newhouse 2019). 
The pay compression ratio is the ratio of the 90th percentile of wages to the 
10th percentile. Low values imply that the best-paid public servants earn little more 
than those at the entry level; high values imply greater differential compensation. 
The average ratio in the ECA region is 4.9, indicating that, on average, the best-paid 
public employees earn almost five times more than the lowest-paid ones. South Caucasus has the highest ratio in the region (8.1) and Kosovo the lowest (2.0). 
Three trends could shape the role of government in ECA in upcoming years, 
for several reasons. First, the aging population of Europe will require expansion 
of healthcare, disability, and long-term care services. These services are more la -
bor-intensive and expensive than other government-provided services. As a re -
sult, the state tends to spend more and employ a larger share of the population 
in aging economies (EBRD 2020). 
Second, support for state ownership is growing. The share of the population 
in advanced economies that favors the expansion of public ownership increased from 27 percent in 2017 to 33 percent in 2020; in the post-transition countries, about 
45 percent of citizens support the expansion of public ownership (EBRD 2020). Sti-
glitz (2015) attributes these trends to rising income inequality and the increased de -
mand for redistribution, potentially through the increased share of state ownership. 
Third, the COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced citizens’ desire for the state to 
socialize individual risks. Even before the pandemic, globalization and techno -
logical change had reduced job security, especially for the most economically 
vulnerable individuals. Like many previous crises, the pandemic increased peo -
ple’s risk aversion, which often leads to increased interest in a larger role for the 
state. Citizens in ECA have already witnessed a massive expansion of their gov -
ernments’ role in public health systems, the welfare state, and education through policy interventions and regulations. 
The Quality of Governance in Europe and Central Asia
The influential role that government has in shaping the broader productivity and the labor market of countries in ECA underscores the importance of looking at 
the quality of governance. Emerging research shows that the quality of gover -
nance is significantly tied to the quality of life, with changes in governance qual -
ity associated with higher quality of life (Helliwell and others 2018). Better gov -
ernance is also associated with better development outcomes, including long-term growth (Kaufmann and Kraay 2002) and reduced inequality and poverty (World 
Bank 2006, 2017).
The average score of the six subcomponents of the Worldwide Governance 
Indicators (WGI) provides a valuable indicator of the quality of governance (box 2.1). ECA scores above average on both relative government expenditure and the 
quality of governance. This finding is consistent with the global trend in which gov -
ernment quality is positively correlated with government expenditure (figure 2.6). 60 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update Spring 2021
How is governance defined?
Governance can be defined and measured in vari -
ous ways. Some definitions cast a broad net. The 
World Bank’s 2017 World Development Report, for 
example, defines governance as “rules, enforce -
ment mechanisms, and organizations.” Other defi -
nitions are narrower, defining public sector gover -
nance as “the manner in which power is exercised in 
the management of a country’s economic and social 
resources for development” (World Bank 1991). 
Several datasets provide intercountry and 
intertemporal comparisons of the quality of gover -
nance. They include the following:
• World Governance Indicators (WGI), pro -
duced by the World Bank annually since 1996 for more than 200 countries (Kaufmann, 
Kraay, and Mastruzzi 2006)
• The World Economic Forum (WEF) gover -
nance dataset, produced since 2007 for more 
than 140 countries (WEF 2018)
• Public Sector Governance (PSG) indicators, 
developed by the World Bank for the EU 
Commission, which focus on the public sec -
tor and public administration (Bernstein, Recanatini and Georgieva-Andonovska 2018)
• The Bertelsmann Transformation Index (BTI) 
(Bertelsmann Stiftung 2020) 
• The International Country Risk Guide (ICRG), produced by the PRS Group (PRS Group 2020). 
Most of these indicators are highly correlated, 
and some of them (such as the ICRG) are used as components in constructing other indexes. The 
WGI uses a consistent methodology and covers 
the largest number of countries over the longest 
time period. This chapter, therefore, uses the WGI 
governance indicators. 
The WGI defines governance as “the traditions 
and institutions by which authority in a country is exercised,” including “the process by which gov -
ernments are selected, monitored and replaced; the capacity of the government to formulate and 
implement sound policies; and the respect of citi -
zens and the state for the institutions that govern economic and social interactions among them” 
(Kaufmann, Kraay and Mastruzzi 2006). It measures 
governance through six subindices: • Control of Corruption “captures percep -
tions of the extent to which public power is 
exercised for private gain, including both 
petty and grand forms of corruption, as well 
as ‘capture’ of the state by elites and private interests.”
• Government Effectiveness captures “per -
ceptions of the quality of public services, the 
quality of the civil service and the degree of 
its independence from political pressures, 
the quality of policy formulation and imple -
mentation, and the credibility of the govern -
ment’s commitment to such policies.”
• Political Stability and the Absence of Vio -
lence captures “perceptions of the likelihood of political instability and/or politically-moti -
vated violence, including terrorism.”
• Regulatory quality captures “perceptions of the ability of the government to formulate 
and implement sound policies and regula -
tions that permit and promote private sector 
development.”
• Rule of Law captures “perceptions of the extent to which agents have confidence in 
and abide by the rules of society, and in par -
ticular the quality of contract enforcement, property rights, the police, and the courts, as 
well as the likelihood of crime and violence.”
• Voice and Accountability captures “percep -
tions of the extent to which a country’s citi -
zens are able to participate in selecting their 
government, as well as freedom of expres -
sion, freedom of association, and a free media.” 
 These subindices reflect more than 30 under -
lying data scores, which represent the views of 
citizens, entrepreneurs, and experts in the public, 
private, and nongovernmental organization (NGO) 
sectors around the world. The values of the WGI 
subindices range from –2.5 to +2.5, with higher val -
ues indicating better governance. This report uses 
the average score across the six subindices as the 
indicator of the governance quality, referred to as 
the governance score.

Figure 2.7 illustrates the country-level variation in governance quality across 
the world. It and figure 2.8 show that ECA has the widest subregional disparities 
of governance quality in the world. Northern Europe and Western Europe have 
the world’s highest governance quality; the Russian Federation and Central Asia 
have the lowest rankings within ECA. 
This subregional variability is also evident for the six subindices of the WGI 
(figure 2.9). Northern and Western Europe have the highest scores across all sub -
indices. Central Asia and the Russian Federation have the lowest scores, except for Political Stability (where Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus, and Turkey 
have the lowest scores). FIGURE 2.6  Correlation

Figure 2.10 shows the change in governance score across world regions, by 
subindex, between 1996 and 2019. Alongside East Asia and the Pacific, ECA leads 
the world in improvement in government quality, not only in the aggregate but 
also over almost all subindices over the past two decades. Over the same period, 
the governance quality in all other world regions declined.
Governance in the region improved significantly in underperforming coun -
tries in the past 25 years. Most countries with low scores in 1996 increased 
them by 2019, and countries with higher scores maintained their scores (figure 
2.11). Countries in the South Caucasus and the Western Balkans saw the largest 
increases in the quality of governance, albeit with some deterioration in recent years, particularly in the Western Balkans. Russia has not improved signifi -
cantly since the mid-1990s, and Turkey has seen some deterioration. The overall governance scores of Hungary, and to some extent Poland, also declined in re-
cent years. 
Countries at the lower end of the ECA income distribution enjoyed larger 
improvements in government quality, and countries at the higher end demon -
strated more stability (figure 2.12). These trends point to the convergence of gov -
ernment quality in the region over time and explain the improvement in the re -
gion as a whole.

Harnessing Data and Digitalization to Improve 
State Capacity 
Technology can make government more efficient. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed the 
costs of delaying digitalization and modernization of the public sector. Improving the 
public sector’s productivity would have a profound impact in ECA, where state capacity 
in many countries is weak. As the data revolution transforms management systems 
worldwide, it offers the public sector an opportunity to optimize its management and 
organizational processes for a more significant societal impact. To capture the full benefits 
of the data revolution in the public sector, governments must integrate data systems 
within the public administration in a manner that actively addresses the public sector’s 
unique constraints to innovation and information.
Data and Digitalization 
ECA is home to some of the most effective governments in the world. But state 
capacity is still weak in many of the region’s countries. Improving the efficiency 
of the state while building citizen trust is a key priority for governments across 
the region. This task is particularly important for members of the European 
Union (EU) and countries aspiring to join it, which are aligning with EU stan -
dards of good governance (Arizti and others 2020).
Data lay the ground for improved decision making, optimized government 
functioning, and more effective resource allocation in government processes such as revenue management, procurement, and citizen interface (Hashim and Piatti-
Fünfkirchen 2018; World Bank 2016, 2020a). Digitalization allows governments to provide higher-quality services more efficiently and at a lower cost, increases 
government accountability and transparency, and reduces corruption (Anderson 
2009; Chopra 2014; Cumbie and Kar 2016; Bearfield and Bowman 2017; Ma and 
Zheng 2017). 
The impact of the data revolution on the public sector hinges on the adoption 
and use of data systems, which entail the collection and use of accessible and 
actionable information relevant to decision making.
2 The reach and sustainability 
of the data revolution are closely linked to digital transformation in the public 
sector. That transformation is marked by  three processes that enable govern -
ments to seamlessly access, engage with, and apply data in an agile, responsive, and proactive manner:
• digitization (the conversion of information from analog to digital formats)
• digitalization (the adoption of digitized data and tools)
• GovTech (a whole-of-government approach to public sector modernization 
that promotes simple, efficient, and transparent government with the citizen 
at the center of reforms). 
The data revolution can transform the internal organization and management 
of the civil service and policy making by making them more empirical. 
2. The “data revolution” refers to the rapidly declining cost of producing, analyzing, and 
aggregating data and the substantial increase in the number of people who are trained in analytical methods. 66 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update Spring 2021
Empiricism is an approach that creates data-based mathematical models, which 
are used to reach conclusions about observed processes and form predictions 
about their progression.3 To fully capture the enormous benefits that improved 
data use can have for the public sector, governments must integrate data systems within the public administration in a manner that addresses the public sector’s 
unique constraints to innovation and information. 
How Does Digital Government Become Better Government?
Across the world, the quality of government is increasingly informed by the ex -
tent to which governments harness digital tools and GovTech to optimize man -
agement, service delivery, and overall state capacity. Technology offers the poten-tial to increase efficiency, transparency, responsiveness, and citizen trust, directly 
affecting government. The COVID-19 pandemic made salient the opportunities 
that lie in fostering public sector modernization and the costs associated with 
delaying digitalization and GovTech implementation.
Digitalization of government has been shown to improve government capac -
ity. Implementation of e-filing of taxes and e-procurement improves government 
capacity to raise and spend fiscal resources by lowering tax compliance costs, improving tax collection and public procurement competitiveness, and reducing 
corruption (Kochanova, Hasnain, and Larson 2020). The association between e-
government and improved capacity is particularly strong for ECA countries, 
given their level of development, Internet penetration and the interoperability of 
their information management systems. Durkiewicz and Janowski (2018) find 
that digital government indicators (the e-participation index, the online service 
index, laws relating to information and communications technology) are strongly 
correlated with government effectiveness and regulatory quality. They conclude 
that ensuring value from digital transformation requires investment in tradi -
tional governance quality. 
Country case studies reveal the mechanisms through which digitalization im -
proves government capacity. The introduction of e-filing of taxes in Tajikistan 
lowered the compliance costs of firms by reducing the amount of time needed to 
fulfill tax obligations. It also made tax payments more equitable, as electronic 
filing greatly reduced opportunities to reduce the tax burden through bribes. 
Firms that were less likely to evade taxes—and were thus charged comparatively 
more by corrupt tax officials—decreased their tax payments (Okunogbe and Pou -
liquen 2018). In Albania, the government worked with the World Bank to intro -
duce more agile electronic services, which significantly increased citizen satisfac-tion and reduced the time needed to process a request. The time needed to register 
a vehicle fell from 5.3 days in 2016 to 30 minutes in 2020, and the process to request 
a health card, which took 5 days in 2016, could be completed in just a few minutes. 
Croatia digitalized its justice system to improve its efficiency (box 2.2).
3. See Hausman (1998) for a discussion of the distinction between a classical approach, 
which starts out with a theoretical model on the functioning of a given process, and an empirical approach, in the context of economics. Chapter 2: Data, Digitalization, and Governance  ● 67
Efficient, fair, and accessible justice systems pro -
mote peace and security, encourage investment 
and growth, and provide citizens with fundamental 
protection of their rights. Digital technology that 
incorporates integrated case management sys -
tems, online conflict resolution, online access to court registries, litigation analysis, and the use of 
artificial intelligence applications can transform the 
justice sector. The benefits of introducing digital 
technologies can be especially significant for coun -
tries with lengthy trials and low public confidence in justice systems. 
Digital justice has the potential to bring the fol -
lowing benefits: 
• greater efficiency and effectiveness of case management, by expediting processing time 
and automating standardized tasks
• improved access to justice services, by using 
digital tools and holding remote hearings 
• increased transparency, by facilitating access to information, securing legal documents, 
and reducing opportunities for corruption
• better quality of judicial decisions and con -
sistent application of the law, by providing streamlined access to the legal text, case law, 
and court decisions
• a more resilient justice system with adequate governance and management structure that 
respects the independence and impartiality 
of the judiciary
• efficient cross-border judicial cooperation
• greater predictability of judicial decision mak -
ing, which allows firms to better assess the 
risk/reward analysis of engaging in litigation
• greater public trust in the judicial system. 
Reform of the judicial system to implement a 
digital justice approach involves transitioning from paper-based processes to digitized processes; 
recruiting new professionals, such as data analysts, 
computer scientists, and designers; promoting 
digital skills that allow judges, prosecutors, judi -
cial staff, and other justice practitioners to use and apply digital technologies and tools effectively; improving the collection and management of digi -
tal information; and developing systems that allow 
various actors, such as police officers, prosecutors, 
courts, and prisons, to exchange information. The 
interoperability of these systems allows the col -
lection and analysis of more accurate information in the context of policymaking and policy reform 
(Cordella and Contini 2020).
Many countries in the ECA region have started 
introducing digital solutions in justice administra -
tion. In 2010, for example, the Ministry of Justice in 
Croatia launched an Integrated Case Management 
System (ICMS) to record and track the progress of 
all court cases. 
The team of the Data and Evidence for Justice 
Reform (DE JURE) program within the World Bank’s 
Development Impact Evaluation group used this 
rich, case-level database to evaluate the impact 
the speed of justice has on the financial outcomes 
of firms, using the random allocation of cases to 
judges to produce estimates of the causal effects 
of fast or slow judges (DE JURE 2019). The analy -
sis suggests that firm revenue is highly responsive to increases in judge speed (figure B.2.3.1). If firm 
resources remain tied up in prolonged court pro -
ceedings, it can impede a firm’s operations. The gains from introducing the ICMS and increasing judicial efficiency could be substantial for courts 
with high and low numbers of backlogged cases. 
Croatia’s example demonstrates how judicia -
ries may leverage case management systems to 
assess the sources of backlog and delays in courts 
and identify where greater investments in justice 
may lead to higher returns on courts’ efficiency 
and economic growth. Nonetheless, this is just 
one example of the untapped potential of the 
data revolution. Data may also be used to identify 
(and address) gaps in access to justice for vulner -
able populations; motivate and incentivize judges to increase their efficiency; diagnose and reduce 
biases in judicial decisions, ensuring equal treat -
ment under the law; and assess the impact of any new laws on citizens and firms (Ramos-Maqueda 
and Chen 2020). Digitalization of justice: the impact of judicial speed on firm 
outcomes in Croatia

Implementation of e-procurement in infrastructure provision in India and In -
donesia significantly improved the quality of outputs, especially by facilitating 
the entry of high-quality contractors (Lewis-Faupel and others 2016). Digital fi -
nancial platforms to monitor the transfer of funds between government agencies reduced leakage in public programs in India (Banerjee and others 2020). 
The impact of digital technologies on government capabilities depends on the 
quality of existing institutions. Strong institutions are ones in which rules, power, 
and resources are structured to incentivize politicians, government officials, and 
citizens to act in the best interest of public outcomes. Digital technologies in 
strong institutions amplify these incentives and can be highly effective in The transition to digital justice platforms also 
presents challenges, including protection of sen -
sitive information. Court documents can contain 
confidential informants’ names, information on 
people’s mental health histories, and information 
about children. Failing to protect these data can 
erode trust in the country’s judicial system, under -(continued)

mining the rule of law and defeating the purpose of reform. But the successful examples in Europe 
and around the world should encourage countries 
to broaden the use of modern technologies to sup -
port their judicial systems and reap the benefits for economic growth and social development.Source: DE JURE (2019).
Note: Figure plots the elasticity of relative firm revenue to judicial speed, measured by the proportion of cas-
es resolved within one year, by geographical jurisdiction. Relative firm revenue is defined as the ratio of firm 
revenue to the average revenue of all firms involved in a judicial proceeding in each jurisdiction during 2010–
17. In the jurisdictions with the highest elasticity (darkest color), a 10 percent increase in judicial speed is as-
sociated with an increase of more than 50 percent in relative firm revenue.
FIGURE B2.2.1  Elasticity of firm revenue to judicial speed in commercial courts in Croatia Chapter 2: Data, Digitalization, and Governance  ● 69
improving public outcomes. In contrast, adoption of digital technologies in the 
context of clientelist institutions can cause politicians to reject digitally enabling 
reforms, because they are accountable to a small set of political elites. Patronage 
bureaucracies resist e-government, because it reduces the room for discretion 
and rent-seeking opportunities. Digital technologies in unaccountable institu -
tions increase the risk of elite capture and wasting public resources on e-govern -
ment projects that are limited (World Bank 2016). 
Digitalization of Government in Europe and Central Asia
The degree of government digitalization can be characterized in various ways. 
One is to use an aggregate, qualitative classification, such as the GovTech Matu -
rity Index (box 2.3). An alternative is to consider how many government systems have transitioned to an electronic format that allows all transactions to be con -
ducted electronically. 
The World Bank database on Digital Government/GovTech Systems and Ser -
vices (DGSS) tracks digitalization at the country level for several core govern -
ment systems.  Five are selected for analysis: 
• human resources management information system (HRMIS)
• public investment management system (PIMS) 
• tax management information system (TMIS)
• financial management information system (FMIS)
• procurement system.
The DGSS assesses these systems at the central administration level. 
The GovTech Maturity Index (GTMI) measures a 
country’s performance on a GovTech trajectory by 
determining the extent to which a whole-of-gov -
ernment approach, focus on simple and efficient government, and citizen-centric modernization are 
incorporated into a government’s advancement of 
digital innovation. The index has four components: 
government core operations, public service deliv -
ery, citizen engagement, and GovTech enablers. It can be used to benchmark countries and identify 
the GovTech solutions that are needed. 
The GTMI is based on the World Bank’s Digi -
tal Government/GovTech Systems and Services 
(DGSS) dataset. The DGSS comprises comprehen -
sive information on 43 indicators collected from the governments of 198 economies about the maturity of GovTech foundational blocks from two 
perspectives: (a) an international outlook based on data available on 198 economies and (b) a regional 
outlook based on a subset of data, with a focus on 
168 World Bank client countries benefiting from 
financial and technical assistance. Six other indica -
tors of the GTMI come from the 2020 UN e-Gov -
ernment Survey, the 2018 Identification for Devel -
opment (ID4D) dataset, and the 2019 Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI). 
The GTMI is the simple average of the normal -
ized scores of four components measuring the 
maturity of GovTech foundational blocks based on 
these 49 indicators. It divides 198 economies into 
four groups based on their average GTMI score

One indicator of government digitalization is the number of central adminis -
tration systems that have been digitalized. All countries in ECA except Tajikistan, 
Turkmenistan, and Ukraine have at least four systems in place (table 2.2 and 
figure 2.13). The system that is most often missing is digital PIMS. 
The degree of functionality and integration of the digital systems in place is 
critical. A fragmented digital HRMIS, in which agencies have separate, stand-
alone systems, is less functional than a centralized platform that is shared across 
all government units. An e-procurement system in which information on forms 
and contracts can only be viewed is less functional than one in which transac -
tions can be carried out. Chapter 2: Data, Digitalization, and Governance  ● 71

Fixed broadband subscriptions per 100 people
Source: 2020 WBG Digital Government/GovTech Systems and Services (DGSS) Dataset and World Development Indicators (World Bank 2020c).In many countries in the region, government digitalization is ahead of digita -
lization of the economy as a whole. Figure 2.15 plots the correlation between the 
number of GovTech systems implemented in a country, weighted by functional -
ity, and the number of fixed broadband subscription per 100 people, a proxy for the degree of digitalization of the economy (using the degree of 4G mobile Inter -
net coverage as a proxy results in a similar pattern). The results show that in many countries, governments are digitalized, but lag in terms of broadband ac -
cess. Increasing connectivity is critical to making full use of digitalization in the public sector. 
Beyond Digitalization: Building an Empirical Public 
Administration 
Data help direct public expenditure to its most productive uses, track the activi -
ties and motivations of the public sector workforce, and manage organizations to 
a 21st century standard. Recent advancements in data and digitalization can 
transform how public sector personnel acquire, interact with, and apply informa -
tion to organizational decisions. Wider access to and engagement with information can, in turn, help optimize public sector management and improve productivity 
(Dal Bó, Finan, and Rossi 2018; Hjort and others 2019; Callen and others 2020). 
Data analytics provide an opportunity to improve government services. In 
2014, for example, the Polish Labour Office implemented automated, data-driven 
decision making to determine eligibility for unemployment assistance. The move reduced bias, inefficiency, and errors. Analysis of transactional data from the 
FMIS of Cambodia and Pakistan by Hashim and others (2019) found that a sig-
nificant share of the budget was not subject to internal controls or was routed Chapter 2: Data, Digitalization, and Governance  ● 75
outside of the system. Data-driven approaches have been shown to improve the 
quality of services, such as police patrolling (Mastrobuoni 2020). City govern -
ments have had success with an empirical approach to performance measure -
ment known as the CitiStat model (Nam 2014). In 2017, the Bulgarian govern -
ment introduced shared services to make the administration more efficient by centralizing and digitalizing general administrative functions (initially human 
resources and financial management). Estonia, North Macedonia, and Denmark 
have also used digitalization and data to improve government capacity (box 2.4). 
To ground the public sector in empiricism and inform policy making with evi -
dence, governments must strengthen their personnel’s capacity to undertake and manage empirical work. The data revolution should not be confined to the top of 
the public sector hierarchy; it should be integrated throughout the public service. 
This integration can be achieved in three ways. 
First, recruitment can help push the public sector toward a data-driven skillset 
and culture. In the status quo, public managers are incentivized to recruit officials 
with policy beliefs that may perpetuate conventional and inefficient perspectives 
on data systems and digitalization (Besley and Ghatak 2005). Recruiting person -
nel who value the data revolution and have the skills to incorporate it into public service practices is key to institutional change. 
Second, capacity building of existing personnel is crucial. The World Develop-
ment Report: Digital Dividends  (World Bank 2016) outlines the need to develop 
analog complements to information technology to construct information systems 
that link decision making to data-driven information. Analog complements in -
clude skillsets that allow public officials to harness opportunities of the digital world and accountable institutions that use the Internet to empower citizens. 
Many governments are introducing data tech -
nologies to improve public sector management. 
A leading example is Estonia’s X-Road system, a 
connected information infrastructure that houses 
administrative data (a population register, a busi -
ness register, a medical prescription database). The digital data exchange facilitates administrative 
processes by capitalizing on data analytics across 
linked databases. The system is so efficient that 
it allows users to register a company in just three 
hours. 
A project in Skopje in North Macedonia relies 
on the Internet of Things to automate the man -
agement of traffic. The system collects data from detectors on the road, air quality sensors, and traf -
fic monitoring cameras to automate traffic lights to optimize traffic flow. The system has reduced travel 
time in the city by up to 20 percent.
The Danish government has devised a data-
driven early warning system to alert authorities of 
socially vulnerable children. The system collects data 
from various sources, such as documented mental ill -
ness, missed doctor’s appointments, and poverty indicators in specific regions, to devise a point sys -
tem. If a threshold is reached, a child is flagged, and the appropriate intervention is initiated. 
The Danish government has also experimented 
with predictive data analytics to assist seniors. 
Drawing on personal health, assistance history, 
and text messages with caregivers, the model can 
predict with 80 percent accuracy when a new level 
of assistance is needed.Using data to improve public management in Estonia, North 
Macedonia, and Denmark
BOX 2.476 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update Spring 2021
The digital revolution can make routine and transaction-incentive tasks 
cheaper, faster, and more convenient. It is more limited in transforming tasks that 
require human judgment, intuition, and discretion for better decision making. 
Therefore, the building of robust information management systems requires ana -
log complements that ensure that the quality, management, retrieval, and reuse of data is maximized for broad-based gains (World Bank 2016, 2021). For exam -
ple, in the CitiStat or PerformanceStat data-driven model used by many local governments to improve performance, the “data” component (the information 
produced by the data collection system) is complemented by an “analog” com -
ponent (meetings to discuss the performance dashboard) (Negoita 2018).
Third, as the vast majority of public sector work is team-based, the creation of 
teams is key for grounding the public sector in empiricism. This is particularly 
true in a context where changes in recruitment policies alone will not substan -
tially alter the composition of the public sector workforce in the short term. The question facing public sector managers is how to complement existing expertise 
with new hires that move public administration toward using data (World Bank 
2021). Recruitment policies should use the stock of personnel as a basis for opti -
mal recruitment and implement approaches that enhance workplace diversity to maximize organizational performance (Lazear 1999; Hong and Page 2001). 
The role of incentives in the data revolution is critical. Individual-level incen -
tives to acquire, absorb, and act on data and analytical insights are necessary to create a data-oriented public service. An individual’s decision to engage with 
data and information determines and is determined by the nature of the hierar -
chy he or she inhabits (Aghion and Tirole 1997). As the core organizational sys-tem of government is a hierarchy, its design will determine the extent to which 
officials capitalize on the data revolution (World Bank 2021). 
The passage of reform will differ across and within countries, depending not 
only on personnel characteristics but also on the nature of the institutional envi -
ronments, which are shaped by cultural and historical features, as Bialas (2013) 
shows in Poland, Gogeanu (2015) and Munteanu (2015) show in Romania, and 
Đorđević (2016) shows in Serbia. Many public services in ECA have a history of 
centralized state control and rigid hierarchy (Meyer-Sahling 2009; O’Connor, Knox, and Janenova forthcoming), which inform the incentives to adopt and use 
data systems. 
Harnessing Human Resource Management Data 
Governments can start implementing a more empirical approach to public sector 
management by using human resource management (HRM) data, as personnel 
management is a key determinant of state capacity and regional productivity. 
The performance of and decisions of public sector workers affect the organi -
zational productivity and fiscal sustainability of government (World Bank 2020a). 
Because of their vast number in ECA, even modest improvements in their pro -
ductivity can have a large impact on public services and the broader economy (Heichlinger and others 2018).
Over the past 30 years, many ECA governments accelerated the adoption of 
data management systems as part of their New Public Management reforms Chapter 2: Data, Digitalization, and Governance  ● 77
(Heichlinger and others 2018).4 The number of ECA countries adopting HRMIS 
rose steadily between 2000 and 2018 (figure 2.16). 
By and large, however, these systems collect only basic information on staff 
rather than information that might make the public service more effective (figure 
2.17). Few ECA countries use data to inform strategic HRM policies (Thijs, Ham -
merschmid, and Palaric 2018; OECD 2019). Instead, policies tend to be based on intuition and past practices (Melchor 2013). 
There is significant scope to increase the type and quality of HRMIS data 
(OECD 2019); integrate such data with a range of complementary administrative 
and survey data on performance, competencies, skills, engagement, and motiva -
tion; and apply these data to decision making. Acknowledgment of the impor -
tance of evidence-based policy making is growing, but public administrations have collected little data on the bottlenecks to the take-up and application of data 
systems. Such information could provide evidence of the efficacy of data for good 
governance (OECD 2019). 
Governments have been strategically using human resources data to improve 
the quality of the civil service (Van Ooijen, Ubaldi, and Welby 2019). For example, 
In Belgium, the Copernicus Reform introduced workforce planning combined 
with efforts to realign institutional objectives with the medium-term budget and the skillsets requirements. In Ireland, the government introduced the Public Ser -
vice 2020, a framework for fostering innovation in Ireland’s public service. In It -
aly, the government has used predictive analytics in the health sector to forecast 
the demand for doctors, nurses, dentists, midwives, and pharmacists. The analysis

helped the government make better projections of which professions had surpluses 
and shortages and prioritize their deployment based on regional demand. 
Challenges to Better Data Use 
Adoption of data reform is fiscally feasible in ECA. But many public administra -
tions are rigid and hierarchical, features that prevent reforms from taking hold. 
As natural monopolies, governments face little competitive market pressure 
to encourage information-sharing (Moore and Hartley 2008). In addition, many 
public sector activities fall under the mandates of multiple ministries—road safety, 
for example, is both a transport and a health issue—but information is typically 
housed within agencies. Making such data and information available beyond its 
source institution is not easy, as shared information must pass across agency filing 
systems and could lead to smaller agency budgets if it becomes clear that some 
resources should be directed elsewhere. As a result, multiple agencies collect infor -
mation that cannot be linked by a network. Information silos reduce the ability of 
organizations and service providers to harness the potential of data revolution 
across and within ministries. Moreover, political incentives may not be aligned 
with such reforms, as they often take a long time to implement, and political lead -
ers often prioritize short-term election cycle gains (World Bank 2016). 
Security concerns can also impede strategic data initiatives (box 2.5). Many 
countries in the region lack comprehensive regulations on how both government agencies and private companies can use the personal information they hold. The FIGURE 2.17  Types of human resource data collected by OECD countries in Europe and Central Asia

The digital revolution has driven exponential 
growth in the high-value data accumulated by 
national, regional, and local governments, includ -
ing vast quantities of personally identifiable infor -
mation collected on government employees, 
taxpayers, students, pensioners, and any person 
or entity interacting with the government. While 
these data have a huge potential to transform how 
the government operates, it also represents a high 
risk of being sought after by cyber-criminals, mali -
cious insiders, and nation-states that may seek access to these data for nefarious purposes. 
To be more transparent and provide better 
citizen services, government agencies need to 
increase data sharing between the agencies and 
citizens and use new technologies for big data ana -
lytics. As governments adopt new technologies, data security becomes more complicated. The 
broader use of mobile devices and IoT and reli -
ance on cloud infrastructure increases the number 
of devices, connections, and networks susceptible 
to attacks. On the other hand, many government 
agencies in the ECA region still depend on legacy 
systems and applications that lack modern secu -
rity functionality and thus are vulnerable to hacker attacks. 
There are clear indications of a global worsen -
ing cyber threat environment. The COVID-19 crisis 
has given rise to additional cyber risks resulting 
from greater reliance on remote working and the 
use of e-government services and mobile bank -
ing. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the number of cyberattacks has increased 
significantly, with public institutions and financial 
services the most targeted victims (IMF 2020b). 
Cybersecurity is increasingly seen as a threat to government operations that rely on digital ser -
vices, such as cloud technologies and application programming interfaces (APIs). Smaller agencies 
and local government departments with smaller 
budgets and IT security teams appear to be the 
most at risk. On the other hand, large centralized 
stores of personal data attract hackers and state 
actors who try to obtain their secrets.A challenge for governments all over the world 
is how to protect these data without imposing high 
costs on data users that would prevent wider use, 
sharing, and analysis of the data. Overly tight con -
trols should not impede strategic data initiatives. Each type of government organization faces its 
own risks. The data protection strategies of every 
organization should depend on the type of data it 
handles and the type of services it delivers.
To create a safe environment for a wide range 
of without compromising the security of agency 
operations, governments can adopt the following 
principles and best practices: 
1. Establish national frameworks to help agen -
cies understand their cybersecurity risks, 
and apply best practices to improve the 
security and resilience of critical infrastruc -
ture and services. 
2. Improve data security by promoting informa -
tion-sharing between government depart -
ments and with the public and private sec -
tors. Cybersecurity advisory councils can be 
created to bring together industry experts, 
academics, and public sector leaders to 
develop cybersecurity strategies.
3. Create a cybersecurity culture by training all 
government employees in cybersecurity.
4. Develop the ability to contain the damage caused by cyberattacks. Develop cyber-
resilience strategies that allow networks to 
adapt, recover, and continue to operate if an 
attack occurs.
5. Improve policies to ensure that government 
vendors comply with procurement rules and 
demonstrate that their tools and services 
comply with security regulations. 
6. Enhance the cross-border coordination of the investigation of and action against cyber -
attacks in order to strengthen deterrence.
7. Develop and test national and cross-border response protocols to improve govern -
ments’ ability to respond to cyber-incidents. 
8. Build skills, resources, and operational capac -
ity in all countries to achieve global impact. How can governments protect the data they collect on 
individuals? 
BOX 2.580 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update Spring 2021
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), put into effect on May 2018 by the 
European Commission, is designed to protect a wide range of personal data on 
EU residents (EU 2021). The new regulation protects not only uniquely identify -
ing information, such as official identity documents, but also information re -
quested by websites, including IP and email addresses; physical device informa-
tion, such as a computer’s MAC address; home address and date of birth; and 
online financial information, including online transaction histories. Countries in 
ECA may need to establish a dedicated data protection agency with independent 
authority and enforcement capabilities. One of the main goals of such an agency 
should be to set and enforce clear standards for the government to access per -
sonal data of its citizens. 
Free-riding concerns also affect the acquisition and absorption of information 
in hierarchical environments. Officials acquire information in the public sector 
based not only on their own circumstances but also on the decisions of others 
(Aghion and Tirole 1997). If a team member undertakes the costly effort to learn 
and organize information for a project, other team members may have little in -
centive to do so—a classic free-rider problem. 
Bureaucratic conservatism may also constrain the broader use of data in the 
public sector. Mission-oriented employees in the public sector are often less likely 
to adopt new practices, because they have a predefined set of missions or beliefs, 
making organizational change more challenging (Williams and Yecalo-Tecle 
2020). Management of these classical characteristics of the public institutions is a 
crucial determinant of whether public officials capitalize on the data revolution 
(Arizti and others 2020). 
Data and Digitalization for Collaborative 
Governance 
Many citizens in ECA mistrust the government and view political decisions as nontrans -
parent. The data revolution and digitalization offer an opportunity to foster collaboration 
between governments and civil society that will enhance public sector efficiency and 
service delivery and increase citizens’ trust in government. One of the most promising 
mechanisms for doing so is open government data (OGD), which reduces the transaction 
costs of gathering, analyzing, and disseminating public sector data and allows for a more 
comprehensive understanding of the quality of public governance as a whole. 
Trust, Transparency, and Opportunities for Digital, 
Collaborative Governance
Trust in government is weak in many ECA countries. According to the 2019 Gal -
lup World Poll, in 29 of the 50 countries in the region, less than half of citizens 
have confidence in their national government. Trust is greatest in Central Asia 
and the South Caucasus, where the share of citizens who have confidence in the 
government exceeds 60 percent (the only subregions in which the share exceeds 
50 percent). Trust is lowest in Central Europe and the Western Balkans, where no 
more than 30 percent of citizens have confidence in their government (figure 2.18). Chapter 2: Data, Digitalization, and Governance  ● 81
Citizens in the region also view decisions in their country’s politics as non -
transparent. The majority (53.5 percent) of respondents to the European Social 
Survey (2018) indicated that decision making in their country’s politics is not 
transparent; only 12.3 percent expressed the view that they are very transparent.5 
Where data are available, perceptions of the transparency of political decisions 
are weakest in Central and Southern Europe and the Western Balkans. 
The data revolution and digitalization can help build strong linkages between 
governments and citizens by reducing the information asymmetry between 
them, transforming governance models from hierarchical technocracies to open 
networked economies (De Blasio and Sorice 2016; Máchová and Lněnička 2016), 
thereby improving trust in and legitimacy of governments. 
Feedback mechanisms have enabled civil society to directly engage with gov -
ernments and suggest ways to improve the usability and quality of public data. They allow civil society to become a stakeholder in the governance of public data 
systems.
Digitally advanced countries in ECA are already making use of digital plat -
forms and data analytics for collaborative governance. Iceland, for example, ex -
perimented with allowing citizens the chance to write parts of its constitution

Serbia, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.6. While the “crowdsourced” draft of the constitution eventually failed to be passed by the Icelandic Parliament, this process provided the opportunity to understand what an inclu -
sive constitutional reform could look like  (Landemore 2015).FIGURE 2.18  Trust in government and views on transparency in Europe and Central Asia, by subregion

Estonia publishes the early stage of draft laws and their development on the 
government website and allows citizens and interested parties to provide feed -
back and share their knowledge (World Bank 2016).
By integrating mechanisms of civic engagement with conventional account -
ability mechanisms (such as political checks and balances, audit systems, and administrative rules), governments can help civil society actively participate in 
decision-making processes (Malena, Forster, and Singh 2004; De Blasio and Sorice 
2016). Inputs from civil society can result in responsive governance if feedback 
on policy implementation is used  for improvement (World Bank 2021). 
Websites can serve as a channel of fluid communication with citizens. Most 
ECA governments have established national websites that allow citizen partici -
pation in policy making. Many have also established websites for citizens to pro -
vide feedback on public services or participate in decision making and websites that are part of broader grievance redressal mechanisms (figure 2.19). The use of 
these websites is limited, however. In ECA, only in Estonia, Iceland, and Switzer -
land more than 20 percent of citizens use the Internet to participate in online consultations to define civic or political issues (figure 2.20). The share of indi -
viduals using the Internet to post opinions on the same kind of issues is only slightly higher. Low take up of online channels of communication may reflect the fact that technological fixes to communication deficits don’t always work in the 
presence of structural weaknesses in political systems (Grossman, Humphreys 
and Sacramone Lutz 2020).
Fostering knowledge collaboration between citizens and governments may 
strengthen the research, monitoring, and evaluation framework of policy-making

processes (Ruijer, Grimmelikhuijsen, and others 2020). Governments can crowd-
source solutions to pressing challenges from civil society, freeing up resources 
that can be reallocated to other priorities (Church 2017). Such collaboration be -
tween civil society and governments can advance democratic participation (Noveck 2009) and improve the quality of data and information, which can be 
used to improve service delivery design and implementation (Nagaraj, Shears, 
and de Vaan 2020). Moscow’s management of pothole complaints shows how 
digital civic engagement can both improve service delivery and bring political 
rewards (box 2.6).
7 For digital engagement tools to be successful in improving 
service delivery, specific, actionable feedback information in the purview of gov -
ernment officials should be provided by citizens, and officials need to be able to 
respond in a relatively short time frame (Grossman, Platas and Rodden 2018). 
Open Government Data and Public Administration Governance 
Open government initiatives vary widely across ECA (table 2.3). Open govern -
ment data (OGD) increase government transparency and civil society collabora -
tion in decision making. Most ECA countries have promoted initiatives that call 
for the release of government data so that they can be freely used, reused, and

distributed by anyone (Ubaldi 2013). The data made available should be open 
both technically (in a machine-readable standard format) and legally (open li -
cense and accessible). 
Several ECA countries have created public data portals. Examples include the 
United Kingdom (data.gov.uk, launched in September 2009); Norway (data.norge.no, launched in April 2010); and Ukraine (data.gov.ua, launched in 2018). 
These sites contain large public government datasets (on healthcare, weather, 
GPS, and the census, for example). The European data portal (europeandatapor -
tal.eu, launched in November 2015) includes more than 1.1 million datasets, cov -
ering the economy and finance, energy, health, population and society, justice and public safety, and the environment in 36 countries. Information and communications technology (ICT) 
allows citizens to engage directly with government, 
thereby improving the quality of public services, as 
citizens create and use data and co-produce solu -
tions (Goldsmith and Crawford 2014). But what are the incentives for governments to promote digital 
engagement? Gorgulu, Sharafutdinova, and Stein -
buks (2020) show that digital participatory gover -
nance can also be a political boon for incumbents.
In 2011, the city government of Moscow 
launched the online portal Nash Gorod  (“Our 
City”). Two years later, it created a mobile phone application within that portal that allowed citizens 
to complain about potholes and attach photos. 
Citizens submit complaints to the responsible 
authority, which, according to the portal, resolves 
most problems within five days. 
The pothole reporting application in Nash 
Gorod was not the first application of its kind. 
Rosyama,  which allows individuals to report vari -
ous road problems, was created in 2010, by the Foundation against Corruption (a non-govern -
mental organization). Rosyama  was developed 
by civil society to highlight the dire conditions of 
road infrastructure and promote local government 
accountability.
Gorgulu, Sharafutdinova, and Steinbuks (2020) 
look at the effect that pothole complaints had on 
the results of the mayoral elections in 2013 and 2018. In order to identify the effect that a higher 
volume of pothole complaints has on the incum -
bent’s number of votes, the authors use within-city 
weather variation that contributed to potholes for 
geophysical reasons. They find that in areas that 
reported more pothole complaints, the incumbent 
mayor obtained more votes and won by a larger 
margin. They argue that this result was driven by 
voters rewarding the incumbent administration for 
its performance and responsiveness in solving pot -
hole complaints. In neighborhoods with a higher prevalence of potholes for climatic reasons, the local 
government could show that it was responsive to 
citizens’ needs by solving the problem quickly and 
fixing the road within five days; the government 
could not make a similar showcase of responsive -
ness in neighborhoods that had fewer potholes.
The experience of the pothole reporting appli -
cation in Nash Gorod  shows that local govern -
ments can simultaneously improve the quality of public services and be politically rewarded for 
doing so by implementing digital participatory 
governance tools. It also shows that politicians who 
are responsive to their citizens’ needs can embrace 
digital governance without the fear of political 
backlash. Talented administrators with a vocation 
for public service should push for increased use of 
digital tools in the relationship between citizens 
and governments. Managing potholes in Moscow through digital public

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of OGD. Demirgüç-
Kunt, Lokshin, and Torre (2020) show that greater trust in government improved 
both health and economic outcomes associated with reopening strategies after 
the first wave of the pandemic (see box 1.2). The pandemic also showed that 
governments’ success in curtailing the spread of the virus while reducing the 
economic consequences depended on their ability to collect data and make data-
driven decisions. Throughout 2020, hotspot (targeted) lockdowns emerged in 
lieu of national lockdowns as governments’ strengthened their data collection 
efforts through better testing and tracing systems. Public Health England, for 
instance, conducts door-to-door testing in areas as small as just a few blocks of a city when a cluster of COVID-19 cases is detected. Epidemiological, economic, 
and open science data were instrumental in facilitating national responses and in 
coordinating global efforts for the development of vaccines and testing and the 
provision of personal protective equipment. 
OGD imply that the public sector is ready to take on a new role as an informa -
tion provider and relinquish its role of information gatekeeper (Davies 2010; 
Reale 2014). Because aggregate public data make information easier to process, 
combine, and analyze, they facilitate greater public scrutiny (Ubaldi 2013). Adop-
tion of OGD thus implies that the government is willing to open accountability processes that allow for constructive criticism and opposing viewpoints (Jans -
sen, Charalabidis, and  Zuiderwijk  2012). Although the initial returns from the 
first bits of data are not substantial, improving systems—through database inte -
gration, for example—can increase returns to open data (World Bank 2021). 
Access to information can increase awareness of government activity and re -
duce corruption if citizens use the information to engage in anti-corruption ef -
forts (Cook 2010). For example, in the Slovak Republic, anti-corruption activists 
spurred the government to reform its public contracting practices. In response, 
between 2011 and 2014, the government put 780,000 public contracts and receipts online and implemented anti-corruption reforms. The public procurement data 
portals received 54,000 visits a month. Ongoing transparency efforts improved 
public perceptions of government (Carolan 2016). 
The expansion of civic space through OGD can foster trust between civil soci -
ety and governments, as citizens use data to express their concerns and hold 
governments accountable on issues that affect them. A thriving and pluralistic 
civic space allows citizens to use and discuss the data and insights from them in 
a nonrestrictive environment to voice their concerns and express discontent. Poli -
cies aimed at expanding civic space signal to citizens that the government is com -
mitted to fostering dialogue and increasing trust and transparency. In the long run, OGD can fulfill citizen’s rights to the public access to government informa-
tion, which is critical in democratic settings (Zuiderwijk and Janssen 2014).
Beyond accountability, both citizens and governments can derive benefits 
from OGD to facilitate decision-making processes. Citizens can make data-driven 
decisions to improve the quality of their lives. Data on crime rates, student–
teacher ratios, and the quality of healthcare, for example, can help people decide 
where to live. For governments, OGD can enhance the efficiency of the public 
sector by building an information network that can facilitate interagency coordi -
nation by allowing information exchange and data reuse (Jetzek, Avital, and 88 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update Spring 2021
Bjorn-Anderson 2014). Civil society can be a partner in improving the quality of 
service delivery through OGD. NGOs in Ukraine, for example, relied on publicly 
available procurement data to construct monitoring platforms that hold both 
procurers and tenderees accountable. This inexpensive mechanism reduced 
prices and collusion in the public procurement process (Baranek, Musolff, 
and Titl 2020). 
The State of Open Government Data in Europe and Central Asia 
Signatories of the Open Government Declaration, issued in September 2011, com-mit to uphold the principles of open and transparent governments and to “foster 
a global culture of open government that empowers and delivers for citizens, and 
advances the ideals of open and participatory 21st century government” (Open 
Government Partnership 2020). As of 2020, the declaration had 78 participating 
countries, 35 of them in ECA. Commitments to make government data available 
to the public range from financial assistance and communication of best practices 
to formal legislation and regulation (Dawes, Vidiasova, and Parkhimovich 2016).

The Global Open Government Index reveals regional variations in open gov-
ernment scores (figures 2.21).9 Constructed by the World Justice Project as a com -
ponent of the Rule of Law Index, it measures government openness based on the 
general public’s perceptions on a scale of 0–1. Estonia, Denmark, Norway, and 
Sweden all have scores above 0.8; Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Belarus, and Albania 
all have scores below 0.5 (figure 2.22).
Signatories to the Open Government Declaration are integrating open data 
policies in legislation aimed at modernizing public entities and adopting policy 
frameworks. The mechanisms through which countries implement OGD vary 
widely. Some countries have a specific open data policy; others have embedded 
it into their national digital strategy or data strategy. For example, Denmark’s OGD policy is part of its digital strategy. It aims to make public sector data acces -
sible in order to strengthen its artificial intelligence capabilities. The government is identifying five datasets that can help realize this vision. In Italy, OGD is part 
of the country’s digital growth strategy for 2014–15. In Slovenia, the policy is part 
of the 2015–20 strategy for public administration. Of the European Union 28 
(EU28) countries that are signatories to the Open Government Declaration, 25 use 
open data as a basis for evidence in policy making, and 24 report that OGD serves 
as a knowledge basis for their daily operations. Three-quarters of EU28 govern -
ments have opted for hybrid governance models that include both central 
8. The Open Government Partnership classifies commitments based on five dimensions; (a) 
anti-corruption (beneficial ownership and open contracting); (b) civic space (assembly, as-sociation, and defense of journalists and activists); (c) open policy making (rules and regu -
lations and participation in lawmaking); (d) access to information (open data on water/sanitation, health, and education and right to information); and (e) fiscal openness (trans -
parency, participation, and oversight). 9. The index is based on scores on four dimensions: publicized laws and government data, right to information, civic participation, and complaint mechanisms. It draws on the World Justice Project’s General Population Poll and the Qualified Respondents’ Questionnaire. The data are normalized on a scale of 0–1. Variable-level data are aggregated to the dimension level for each country, which is then used to come up with an overall score and ranking. Chapter 2: Data, Digitalization, and Governance  ● 89

government and civil society; seven countries (Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Re -
public, Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, and Slovenia) have exclusively top-down 
models for data use (European Data Portal 2019). 
Some governments appear to be implementing their commitments only su -
perficially—making data publicly available without broader transparency com -
mitments (Carolan 2016) or releasing data in harmless domains (Ruijer, Détienne, and others 2020). Released information is often limited to geospatial, 90 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update Spring 2021
transportation, and demographic data and statistics, for example. An analysis of 
30 governments that have made the most advances in OGD commitments and 
actions finds that fewer than one in five government datasets is available for 
public use (World Wide Web Foundation 2018). The Czech Republic has about 
10,000 public sector data providers, but only 30 publish their data on national 
portals, as most of them are small and lack the capacity to publish the data (Eu -
ropean Data Portal 2019). This limited availability may reflect the fact that OGD requires technical expertise, resources, and the interest and willingness of public 
sector bodies.
Frictions in the Supply of and Demand for Open 
Government Data 
Even when OGD is available, its use is often limited, for various reasons  (Attard 
and others 2015; Ruijer and Martinius 2017). Several frictions in the supply and 
demand of open government data may be responsible for this. On the supply 
side, the raw data may of limited use to end-users; only data that are processed 
and customized generate value (Janssen, Charalabidis, and Zuiderwijk 2012; 
Weerakkody and others 2017). For OGD to have an impact, data must be of high 
quality, secure, processed, and used as the basis of public discussion (Halonen 
2012; Huijboom and van den Broek 2011; Carolan 2016; Khemani and others 2016). 
The supply-side incentive structures to release OGD assume that there is a 
political acceptance of OGD—something that may not always be the case. The government may be hesitant to publish data because the public may perceive the 
quality of the data as low. If the public learns that governments rely on low-
quality data for monitoring and evaluation and decision making, OGD efforts 
may erode public trust in governments (Weerakkody and others 2017). 
Governments may also fear the loss of control associated with releasing data 
to the public and engage in “information politics” to safeguard the information 
power vested internally (Barry and Bannister 2014; Davenport, Eccles, and Pru -
sak 1992). Government data are a source of power; the incentive to relinquish this power by making it accessible to the public and/or allowing for multi-stake -
holder decentralized governance may be limited. Carolan (2016) notes that the 
Catch-22 of open data and transparency is that high-value data are often con -
trolled by the same institution that they are meant to hold accountable. 
Because the cost of developing statistical capacity is high, governments may 
forgo investing in building data capacity and data-driven administrations, espe-cially in developing countries (Islam and Lederman 2020).  Other barriers to OGD 
include the lack of real-time provision of data and reusable formats, high cost, and low quality or relevance (World Bank 2021).
The main obstacles hindering OGD impact may stem not from the lack of sup -
ply but from lack of demand (Verhulst and Young 2016). Once data are published, it is often the role of intermediaries—“information brokers”—to strengthen the 
data-processing value chain to yield information that can be understood by the 
public. Obstacles in this process include weak demand for data and the inade -
quate capacity of the public to analyze them (World Bank 2021). Individuals or organizations may not know how to find, process, and use data. These barriers Chapter 2: Data, Digitalization, and Governance  ● 91
The expansion of the Internet and the emergence 
of social media affect the relationship between 
citizens and their governments. Research on tra -
ditional sources of information—mass media like newspapers, radio, or TV—shows that the more 
numerous and pluralistic these sources are, the 
more responsive governments are to their citizens’ 
needs (Prat and Strömberg 2013). Initially, by pro -
viding entertainment and nonpolitical information, the Internet reduced citizens’ interest in politics 
(Zhuravskaya, Petrova, and Enikolopov 2020). The 
expansion of 3G mobile broadband Internet had, 
however, a more substantial impact on governance. 
Guriev, Melnikov, and Zhuravskaya (forthcoming) 
look at the effect of the spread of 3G mobile net -
works on incumbent government approval in 116 countries for the years 2008–2017 and find that 
expansion of 3G increased perceptions of govern -
ment corruption and reduced approval of the gov -
ernment in countries where the Internet is not cen -
sored. The increase in perceptions of government 
corruption is associated with actual corruption 
incidents, providing evidence that mobile Internet 
allows citizens to access information about their 
governments and make them accountable. 
The qualitatively different effect associated with 
the expansion of mobile internet vis-à-vis Internet, 
in general, coincides with the emergence of social 
media. Social media is both a source of informa -
tion and a tool for coordinating citizens. In Russia, for example, it induced protest activity, primarily 
by reducing the cost of coordination (Enikolopov, 
Makarin and Petrova 2020). Qin, Strömberg, and 
Wu (2019) show that in China, collective actions 
spread geographically based on the degree of 
social media connection between locations. 
Little is understood about the effects of social 
media on government accountability through means other than elections and protests  (Zhuravs -
kaya, Petrova, and Enikolopov 2020). An excep -
tion is the study of Enikolopov, Petrova, and Sonin 
(2018) find that blog posts about corruption in large 
state-controlled firms in Russia were associated with higher management turnover and improve -
ments in corporate governance in the long run. 
There is a concern, however, that the increased vis -
ibility of social media activity may threaten bureau -
cratic neutrality if public servants carry out online 
political activity (Cooper 2018). 
Social media can increase the circulation of 
misinformation or false news. While it is not clear whether the prevalence of false news is higher today than in the past, there is overwhelming evidence that false news circulates widely online (Zhuravskaya, Petrova, and Enikolopov 2020). False stories spread considerably more rapidly than true 
ones, probably because of their novelty and emo -
tional charge—and most false stories are spread by humans, not “bots” (Vosoughi, Roy, and Aral 2018). 
During the 2016 US presidential campaign, Face -
book users older than 65 shared seven times as 
many false news stories as younger users, accord -
ing to Guess, Nagler, and Tucker (2019), but false 
news represented a small share of overall activity. Grinberg and others (2019) show that the circula -
tion of false news was highly concentrated among a minority of users.
False news and misinformation are particularly 
problematic for governance if they induce citizens 
to change their beliefs. Barrera and others (2020) 
show that during the 2017 French presidential 
campaign, false news was highly persuasive in 
increasing the voting intention of the candidate spreading misinformation. However, they caution that this result may be driven by the fact that false 
news gives salience to a particular policy issue 
(immigration in the French case), irrespective of 
the truth or falsehood of the news. Their study did 
not involve individuals receiving false news through 
social media; it exposed them to false information 
in an experimental setting. Zhuravskaya, Petrova, 
and Enikolopov (2020) note that it is still unclear whether false news has a persuasion effect when spread through social media. 
The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the risks 
that misinformation spread through social media Information, misinformation, and governance in the era of 
social media

(Continued next page)92 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update Spring 2021
may have on public health. Ajzenman, Cavalcanti, 
and Da Mata (2020) find that adherence to social 
distancing measures decreased when Brazil’s pres -
ident publicly dismissed the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and that this decrease 
was particularly strong in areas with higher levels of 
social media activity. 
How can governments and civil society pre -
vent the spread of false news? Some governments 
have resorted to digital censorship, blocking social 
media. Hobbs and Roberts (2018) show that doing 
so can backfire. When China blocked Instagram, 
millions of Chinese users switched to private net -
works to circumvent the block, accessing censored sites such as Facebook and Wikipedia. Some of 
these users, who had previously been apolitical, 
started consuming political news. 
In a traditional media setting, competition 
among news outlets can reduce bias and improve the quality of information (Gentzkow and Shapiro 
2006). Inducing competition among social media 
platforms could help stem the spread of false 
news. However, social media platforms tend to be 
monopolistic, because of network effects, making 
it difficult to increase competition. 
An alternative strategy for reducing the spread 
of false news is fact-checking, which is usually car -
ried out by civil society organizations. Fact-check -
ing in itself may not be effective in reducing the 
persuasion effect of false news. Barrera and oth -(continued)
 BOX 2.7
ers (2020) show that when individuals exposed to a false statement by a political candidate were sub -
sequently shown information indicating the false -
hood of the statement, they updated their factual 
knowledge on the topic but did not change their 
support for the candidate. 
Fact-checking may reduce the spread of false 
news, however. Henry, Zhuravskaya, and Guriev 
(2021) conducted an experiment in which indi -
viduals were exposed to false news and offered the possibility to share it on Facebook. Providing 
fact-checking reduced the sharing of false news on 
social media by almost half. Imposing a small extra 
cost—asking users to click through an extra screen 
before sharing the false statements—induced a 
further decrease in the rate of false news sharing. 
This evidence suggests that fact-checking has the 
potential to reduce the spread of false news and that creating a very small friction in the act of shar -
ing false news substantially decreases its circulation. 
Twitter adopted such a strategy during the 2020 
US presidential campaign, requiring users to make an extra click to access tweets that included false 
or heavily disputed statements. Labeling false con -
tent and fact-checking may help reduce the spread of false news on social media without resorting to 
censorship and the blockage of the free circulation 
of information, which is fundamental for improved 
accountability and a better quality of governance 
in societies. 
may be particularly significant for disadvantaged communities, where digital 
skills and access to digital tools may be more limited. 
Another issue is that individuals and organizations may focus on single issues 
rather than on broader, more encompassing ones. Networks and communities 
may form around, for instance, environmental protection, education, or health -
care service delivery, making OGD issues more fragmented and less likely to move into national priorities or political agendas. The fact that users of data do 
not always share interests and goals makes advocacy work difficult.
The concept of public interest in OGD has been dubbed a myth, which may 
also help explain the weak demand for OGD (Hellberg and Hedström 2015; Car -
olan 2016). Little is known about the public’s willingness and ability to use data Chapter 2: Data, Digitalization, and Governance  ● 93

2017). Because OGD is a public good, the incentives for civil society to contribute 
to its value chain may be low, as they can enjoy the benefits without having to 
invest resources. 
Even if governments incentivize OGD use, it is unclear that citizens will use 
OGD to monitor the government’s efficiency if formal accountability mecha -
nisms are weak. In the context of endemic corruption, this issue can result in a “second-order collective action dilemma,” in which private actors are more will-
ing to comply with the formal rules (rational strategy) than revert to establish 
informal accountability mechanisms. Formal accountability mechanisms (su -
preme audit institutions, regulatory agencies, the judiciary) are a necessary com -
plement to informal accountability. If OGD reveal failures or problems in service delivery that the government does not respond to, the increase in transparency 
could end up diminishing trust in government institutions. 
High digital connectivity in ECA facilitates the dissemination of OGD, and the 
use of social media can overcome the collective action problem of civil society 
failing to mobilize to hold governments to account. By reducing the cost of infor -
mation and rousing public sentiment about problems and service delivery, social media can help keep governments accountable. However, social media is also a source of misinformation, prompting governments to block or heavily censor it. 
Alternative strategies, such as better fact-checking, may help preserve the func -
tioning of social media without limiting the content that helps improve govern -
ment accountability (box 2.7). 
Beyond frictions in the supply and demand of OGD that may hinder its use, 
limited impact evaluations of OGD policies make it difficult to evaluate the out -
puts and outcomes of OGD efforts (Uhlir 2009). As OGD initiatives are new, it remains too early to evaluate their long-term impact.
Policy Recommendations and Conclusions 
Promoting the intersectoral coordination of decentralized data systems across institu -
tions can expand the impact of the data revolution. Fostering platforms that allow citizens to hold government accountable for their broad approach to using data can help mitigate 
barriers to the use of open government data by civil society. Encouraging direct feedback 
between civil society and governments can break down the firewall between them.
Generating Diagnostics 
Diagnosing the State of the Public Administration 
The quality of public administrations and the level of data use and technological 
sophistication vary widely across ECA. Assessing the state’s capacity can allow 
public administrations to target reform efforts to specific contexts. 
In generating diagnostics, it is important to track the quality of empiricism 
across work units and to analyze what characteristics are linked to the stronger 94 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update Spring 2021
application of empirical methods. Government-wide measurements can high -
light areas of strength and weakness of each organization, unit, or team. 
Survey and administrative HRMIS data can provide input for public admin -
istration diagnostics (Rogger 2017). Schuster and others (2020) show the value of 
timely surveys for coronavirus response. In subsequent research, they evaluated 
the personnel digital readiness for remote work across a range of public admin -
istrations; this exercise laid the ground for adopting a data-driven policy on re -
mote work and digital skill-building. 
Surveys can track the level of data and digital skills and the culture of public 
officials. The results can measure the impact of reforms. Surveys also provide insights into best practices in recruitment, promotion, and capacity building. An example is the Federal Viewpoint Survey (FEVS), which the US federal govern -
ment conducts to improve the management of federal employees. It has been 
used in dozens of pieces of research to examine topics central to public adminis -
tration (Resh and others 2019).
Extending the type of information collected in HRMIS beyond the basic char -
acteristics of the staff is essential to provide a clear picture of staff skills. A survey 
in the United Kingdom found that 40 percent of public sector organizations lack 
the skills needed for digital transformation (GovTechLeaders 2018). Performance-
based testing may be a better measure of digital skills than self-reported 
assessments. 
Maderick and others (2015) and Kaarakaine, Kivinen, and Vainio (2017) at -
tempted to create a performance-based measure of ICT skills for teachers. Assess -
ment of ICT skills can use testing that mimics real-world applications to ensure that staff are able to use a specific dashboard, program, or process. 
Diagnosing the Environment in Which the Public Administration 
Operates
To make meaningful change, governments must first understand the broader 
environment in which the public administration functions. This exercise can pro -
vide insights on regulatory, personnel, cultural, and labor market characteristics that affect the data revolution in the public sector.
The first task in this diagnostic is to take stock of the legal and regulatory 
framework. Such frameworks play an important role in ensuring data security, 
facilitating advances in accountability and trust in the data revolution, and en -
abling the secure and smooth sharing and use of data across institutions and 
sectors. The legal and regulatory infrastructure must be comprehensive and flex -
ible enough to generate an enabling, empirical environment within the public administration. Estonia, a global leader in digital transformation, succeeded in 
modernizing its government partly because of its low legal and public barriers to 
digital transformation (Kattel and Mergel 2019). 
Regulations should aim at breaking down barriers to make way for innova -
tion and implementing unified data classification standards and interoperable IT 
and data systems (World Bank 2021). Examples of regulatory changes that have 
fostered data sharing in Europe include the regulation on the Free Flow of Chapter 2: Data, Digitalization, and Governance  ● 95
Non-Personal Data (FFD), the Cybersecurity Act (CSA), and the Open Data Di -
rective (EC 2020). Further, the New European Interoperability Framework pro -
vides guidance on how to setup interoperable digital services (EU 2017).
Comparative survey data of the private and the public sectors can help iden -
tify agencies that lag behind private sector counterparts and assess the impacts 
of these gaps. Labor market surveys or surveys of potential public sector recruits 
can complement this diagnostic. They could be used, for example, to evaluate the supply of empirical skills (see Thomson, Veall and Sweetman 2018). Surveys can 
also help policy makers understand how these factors affect the decision of em -
pirically minded individuals to apply for or accept public sector positions and the role monetary incentives play in the decision (Dal Bó, Finan and Rossi 2013; 
Mastracci 2009)
Staffing, Capacity Building, and Team Building for Empiricism 
and Innovation
Public administrations in ECA should recruit staff with technological skills. Do -
ing so requires a rethinking of the recruitment process. The United Kingdom’s 
Digital, Data and Technology Fast Stream and Fast Track Apprenticeship pro -
vides opportunities to attract and retain digital skills. To retain and attract skilled 
personnel, the federal government of Australia offers ICT experts more struc -
tured careers. Contracts should balance the attractiveness of recruitment with the 
flexibility required to rotate across staff with different specializations.
Using integrated personnel data to assess the likely future career paths of per -
sonnel can help public institutions make strategic staffing decisions (Melchor 
2013).  In combination with work that aims to project future employment needs, personnel management itself can become more empirical. 
Coordinated efforts across civil services can strengthen capacity-building ef-
forts. The United Kingdom’s Stabilization Unit highlights the importance of 
cross-cutting units in creating a system of capacity building for modernization 
within the public service (Connolly and Pyper 2020). Capacity-building efforts 
must build teams of empiricists  and shift individual attitudes toward empirics. 
Evidence from the literature on civil service management suggests that individ -
ual-focused training may be more effective in shifting beliefs and practices than 
team-focused training because the latter may reinforce existing cultures and lead 
to free-riding problems (Azulai and others 2020).
Teams should be structured to maximize synergies and complementarities of 
knowledge and skills. Peer-to-peer learning and knowledge spillovers have 
proven effective in various environments (Burlig and Stevens 2019; Bandiera and Rasul 2006; Banerjee and others 2013; Hinz and others 2011). The sharing of in -
novations across departments should be supported and best practice examples 
celebrated and documented. Providing training and workshops across work 
units helps build communities of practice outside of traditional hierarchies. The 
power of empiricism can be showcased through the regular sharing of case stud -
ies by management at all levels.96 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update Spring 2021
Incentives throughout the civil service also need to be changed. In public ad -
ministration settings, the decision of an individual to acquire and absorb infor -
mation to make empirical decisions is based on the nature of formal and informal 
institutions in which he or she is embedded. Evidence from Ethiopia indicates 
that when officials have more de facto control over their tasks, they have  more 
accurate information about it (Rogger and Somani 2018), suggesting that auton -
omy and authority mediate personnel incentives to take up and apply data. 
Where feasible, administrations should make promotions and performance 
discussions partly based on attempts—not necessarily successes—for reform. It 
is essential to engage with unions and other public sector stakeholders to ensure their support for incentives for empiricism and evidence-based reform. Ensuring 
political cover by supporting specific areas in which innovations are tested and 
adapting the legal environment are important. For example, Portugal’s Right to 
Challenge Act allows officials to apply for temporary concessions to pilot new procedures that are not within the public service rules.
Governments should articulate a policy of empiricism across political and ex -
ecutive branches, within each organization and team unit, and by each manager, 
making empiricism a backbone of public service management, linked to both the 
individual and the organization. Momentum must work in both top-down and bottom-up directions. To ensure alignment between messaging, perceptions, and 
beliefs, it is helpful to monitor the extent to which staff believe that agendas for 
empiricism reflect the core priorities of the administration at each level. 
Building an Agenda and Platform for Innovation and Reform
To expand the impact of the data revolution, central governments must build mechanisms for intersectoral coordination of decentralized data systems across 
institutions. Where digitalization lags, they must deepen it, as any agenda for 
improved data use requires effective digital infrastructure. 
Some aspects of public service reform toward evidence-based policy making 
can be implemented asymmetrically across a service; others require a whole-of-
government approach. High-level coordination of digital and data-driven activi -
ties across government facilitates implementation (EC 2019). Governments should therefore develop a national strategy to bring together stakeholders 
across ministries and agencies to define the government’s vision, shared needs, potential gaps, and strategic goals (UN 2012). 
The United States developed the Federal Data Strategy, supported by 57 mem -
bers from across the federal government representing 23 agencies (US Federal 
Government 2021). In Germany, the federal government’s data strategy is de -
signed to significantly increase the provision and responsible use of data, pro -
mote data-driven innovations, and prevent the misuse of data (Government of 
Germany 2021). Articulating a set of government-wide standards provides re -
formers with the necessary support as they push reforms in their agency. 
It is also useful to set up dedicated agencies for data governance and data 
management, provide them with the authority to undertake the assigned tasks, 
and regularly assess their role in encouraging empiricism and innovation. Strong Chapter 2: Data, Digitalization, and Governance  ● 97
leadership and coordination are required at these agencies, through functions 
such as a coordination authority and a chief information officer or equivalent. 
Only 29 of the 50 ECA countries—and no country in Central Asia, Eastern Eu -
rope, or the South Caucasus—have this kind of agency. Establishing them is criti -
cal to create a culture of empiricism and provide individuals and teams with 
knowledge and common standards. 
Innovation agencies within governments can provide complementary in -
sights on data use.  Examples include Austria’s GovLab, Denmark’s National 
Center for Public Sector Innovation, Georgia’s ServiceLab, and Portugal’s LabX. These agencies provide the space for proposing solutions to public sector chal -
lenges in an interdisciplinary way. In this process, innovation agencies should 
partner with government entities in a way that allows the government entities to 
receive a substantial part of the praise for any successes but protects them from 
being blamed for failures. 
Whole-of-government agendas for change should be accompanied by creat -
ing a widely accessible infrastructure for data and digital tools. Where feasible, 
setting up a common IT infrastructure on which agencies can access government-
wide data at low cost can generate innovation within organizations and harmo -
nize activities across government. 
Just 20 of 50 ECA countries have a GovTech institution supporting interoper -
ability and interconnectivity across government agencies. The French Ministry of Interior, the Dutch Ministry of Education, and agencies in Germany and Sweden 
have set up cloud networks to allow their staff to store, analyze, and collaborate 
using data on citizens and civil servants while preserving digital sovereignty. The 
government of Moldova uses a platform that consolidates more than 100 data 
centers across the country in a joint management platform (BTS 2019). 
Interoperability makes it possible to share data across government institu -
tions. The United Kingdom’s National Indicator system, for example, mandates that all local governments produce a standardized set of indicators on key ser -
vices. The transition requires the establishment of an interoperable architecture with open data and standards (UN 2012). Systems throughout the government 
must be interoperable at the back end and provide a single-entry point for users 
at the front end through one-stop portals.
Strengthening Platforms for Government Accountability 
Platforms are needed that allow citizens to hold government accountable for their broad approach to using data. An ecosystem of institutions and platforms 
can create incentives to implement cultures of empiricism for higher productivity 
(a priority highlighted in the second section of this chapter) and foster dialogue 
between government and civil society (a priority highlighted in the third section 
of this chapter). Such institutions can be organizations of government, such as the 
US Government Accountability Office, or independent of government, such as 
the United Kingdom’s Institute for Government or the Netherlands’ Institute for 
Public Sector Efficiency Studies, which conducts research on the efficiency of the 
public sector. 98 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update Spring 2021
Civil society institutions can support the quality of empirical analysis in gov -
ernment by undertaking rigorous research, thereby acting as a check on public 
institutions. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has built a reputation for world-class 
analysis of the British government’s budgets; its analysis complements that of the 
government’s Office for Budget Responsibility, providing the British state with a 
powerful combination of checks and balances on fiscal issues. In the higher-ca -
pacity countries of ECA, such institutions can provide a public good that im -
proves the quality of government as a whole.
NGOs can monitor and study the efficacy of government functioning in broad 
terms. The European Civic Space Watch, for example, fosters collective action by a range of civil society groups and advocates for the rights of individuals and 
groups to access information, evaluate it, and speak out. Such platforms and 
ecosystems foster engagement between civil service and civil society; and 
strengthen the capacity of government in the long run. 
The beneficial influence of civic society can be threatened if government tar -
gets its criticism. In authoritarian regimes, such criticism discourages the entry of 
empirically oriented organizations into the ecosystem and reduces the quality of 
empiricism in the polity. Fostering the development of civil society organiza -
tions, particularly in countries where they do not exist, is a necessary starting 
point for holding governments accountable.
Formal accountability mechanisms are necessary for constructive engagement 
between governments and civil society. When cases of corruption or failures in 
service delivery are identified by civil society, formal accountability mechanisms 
(supreme audit institutions, regulatory agencies, the judiciary) need to 
intervene.
Broadening Access to Government Information and Data 
Governments need to make information on government activities and analysis 
available at low cost to civil society. Examples of initiatives that do so include the 
Aarhus Convention, which established the rights of the public across Europe to 
receive environmental information held by public authorities (UNECE 1993), and 
freedom of access to information acts (FOIA), which are in place in a wide range 
of ECA countries.10 Initiatives must be accompanied by protocols and authorities 
powerful enough to monitor and discipline parties that fail to comply with the 
spirit of the law. Citizens who are not satisfied with the government’s decision on 
their FOIA request should have the right for judicial review of their requests.
Making data available does not guarantee that civil society will use them. In -
centives should be created for citizens to process raw government data into com -
pelling and digestible narratives and solutions. One way to do so is through hackathons. In 2018, the Bulgaria State e-Government Agency, in collaboration 
with a range of partners, hosted the Balkan Hackathon to generate innovations 
for societal progress (Balkan Hackathon 2020). In Ukraine, SocialBoost, an NGO 
10. Bosnia and Herzegovina was the first country in the Balkans to pass a Freedom of Infor -
mation Act (in 2000).Chapter 2: Data, Digitalization, and Governance  ● 99
that promotes the use of open data for transparent government, hosted the Social 
Entrepreneurship Hackathon in 2014 (USAID 2015). In response to the COVID-19 crisis, a range of ECA governments organized hackathons that fostered engage-ment with civil society in data-oriented and digital spaces, including GovTech Polska’s HackYeah (HackYeah 2020) and the German federal government’s 
#WeVsVirus (Gegenhuber 2020). 
Governments must be mindful of the potential backlash of misrepresentations 
of official data. The same platforms that allow for rich dissemination of data 
(namely, social media) can be associated with the spread of misinformation and 
false news. Governments should not resort to censorship or the blockage of infor -
mation. Instead, they should promote fact-checking and similar strategies to pro-
vide truthful information and enrich the quality of public debate. 
Governments should provide feedback on the use of OGD by civil society 
organizations and private citizens to generate a virtuous circle of data publishing and use. Transparent, open data alone will not be sufficient to improve service deliv -
ery or hold governments accountable if governments do not respond to its use. 
Encouraging Citizen Action for Public Reform
Societies and governments must promote direct feedback between citizens and government. Where access to broadband Internet lags, it needs to be expanded. 
Citizen participation is likely to be more successful in areas where citizens 
have better local knowledge than public officials (as shown in box 2.6). It is not well suited to technically complex areas, such as utility regulation. Stakeholders 
should focus on reshaping the public administration firewall in areas where citi -
zens are likely to be most effective. 
Closing the feedback loop by telling citizens how the government took action 
regarding their recommendations can build public trust in government. For citi -
zens to have an incentive to provide feedback, governments must be willing and 
able to resolve the concerns citizens raised (World Bank 2016). There is likely to 
be substantial scope for co-production mechanisms, where public officials and 
citizens cooperate to deliver projects or activities (a type of collaborative gover -
nance discussed in the previous section). Such mechanisms capitalize on the 
skills and information of each group. Governments should experiment with ways to engage citizens in co-producing data and capitalizing on the data held by citizens regarding their preferences and local constraints. 
These interactions should be part of a process of making the public sector 
more responsive to local needs.  A starting point is directly engaging citizens is to 
set up a centralized website where individuals can contact the government about their concerns or provide feedback on service delivery. Only 28 of the 50 coun -
tries in the region have this kind of web portal. Most countries in Central Asia 
and Eastern Europe and some in Central Europe, and the Western Balkans lack 
such websites. As many individuals, particularly in disadvantaged communities, 
may lack digital access or be unfamiliar with websites, analog channels of com -
munication should also be provided. 100 ●   World Bank ECA Economic Update Spring 2021
Further Research
Research is needed to better understand and address the challenges outlined in 
this chapter. The gradual implementation of an evidence-based approach in the 
civil service should be accompanied with a research agenda on its impact. The 
outputs of this research agenda will provide leaders and policy makers with the tools they need to adapt and scale programs. In parallel, research on civil soci -
ety’s use and application of OGD can yield insights that can strengthen the im -
pact of the data revolution on government productivity and accountability. 
The research agenda on empirics in the public sector is very rich. To equip the 
civil service with data-oriented individuals and teams, it is important to investi -
gate human resource management questions. These questions include how to (a) attract and retain talented, high-skilled, and innovative individuals; (b) build the 
capacity of existing personnel for data and digital usage; (c) structure perfor -
mance review and promotion systems to incentivize productivity and empiri -
cism; and (d) integrate individuals with different skill sets, experiences, and backgrounds into cohesive teams that are equipped and motivated to harness the 
data revolution in the public sector. It is also important to understand which strategies improve service delivery most (service-wide reforms of sector-specific ones, for example).
The efficacy of individually versus organizationally targeted approaches may 
vary with the structure of the team and the nature of the task. Research can shed light on these interactions. Given the relationship between information and hier -
archy, the research could also explore the degree to which knowledge-sharing may diffuse to differentially shift attitudes, norms, and practices throughout the 
civil service. Findings could support the implementation of new norms and pro -
tocols and foster the use and application of new systems of data and 
digitalization. 
Research could also focus on the factors that motivate civil society to engage 
with OGD. Research on incentives and disincentives to using and applying OGD could inform policies that foster greater collaboration and communication be -
tween the civil service and civil society. Such feedback could push governments toward greater accountability, innovation, and empiricism. 
Impact evaluation could evaluate the outcomes of OGD. Such studies require 
determination of the objectives of OGD and the standardization of the measure -
ment for evaluation. It is also important to evaluate the impact of empirically minded civil service reforms on citizen perceptions, in order to understand how 
to build public support for more ambitious reforms in the same direction. 
Collaboration with academic institutions and think tanks can spur broader 
and faster innovation. External partners could be invited to use data on the pub -
lic service. Such data need to be published in a standardized way, with documen -
tation on the data collection process. The analyses could be used to build momen -
tum within the public service for innovations in empiricism. Creating fellowship and internship opportunities with empirically minded academics and private 
sector analysts could also be helpful.Chapter 2: Data, Digitalization, and Governance  ● 101

Not es:Key conditions and 
challenges  
 
Albania’s economy grew by 3.3 percent in 
2015 -2019, achieving significant reform 
progress while aspiring to EU member-ship. A few large renewable energy pro-
jects and expansion in tourism
1 and gar-
ments’ manufacturing exports drove GDP 
and employment growth. However, productivity has stagnated below that of 
peer countries, and wage pressures could 
reduce competitiveness. Small and Medi-
um Enterprises (SMEs) represent more than 90% of private firms and rely on low -
skilled, low -wage labor. Limited access to 
finance, burdensome logistics and poor market integration discourage private investment, while scarce public revenues 
limit public infrastructure and human 
capital investment.  
Growth halted in 2019, as the earthquake 
further exposed the country ’s low buffers. 
Fiscal consolidation was put on hold and 
external vulnerabilities reemerged.  
The pandemic hit Albania ’s key sectors of 
tourism and manufacturing through the 
recession in the EU, supply chain disrup-
tions, travel limitations and social distanc-
ing measures.   
GDP is projected to have declined by 4.7 
percent in 2020 due largely to a slowdown 
in tourism, though smaller than initially projected as domestic tourism demand 
partially compensated for the drop in for-
eign visits. Public support packages for reconstruction and to mitigate the crisis had a small estimated success in prevent-
ing an increase in poverty and had a sig-
nificant fiscal cost. Recently introduced 
tax incentives further stress already de-clining revenues. Delayed global vaccine 
rollout could cause long -lasting  travel 
restrictions and prevent a recovery of the 
country’s services and manufacturing, 
worsening the performance of businesses 
and delaying the full recovery in employ-
ment. The normalization of the global 
economy will have a significant impact on the shape of the recovery.  
  
Recent developments  
 As key economic sectors were put in lock-
down, the economy experienced a sharp 
contraction of 10.2 percent in Q2. Travel and tourism services were among the first 
sectors hit and a combination of official 
restrictions and post -COVID behavior 
change reduced both supply and demand.  
Sales, profits and employment losses 
affected SMEs disproportionately. Unem-ployment rose to 11.9 percent in Q2. Social 
distancing measures were lifted in the 
summer and employment bounced back, 
with tourism and reconstruction partially absorbing job losses in manufacturing. 
While total job losses have been relatively ALBANIA

Sources: INSTAT and World Bank.  Source: World Bank. Notes: see Table 2.  Albania was hit hard, first by an earth-
quake in November 2019 and then the 
COVID -19 pandemic. As tourism and 
services contracted sharply, GDP and employment slumped. Reconstruction and 
COVID19 related stimulus alleviated the 
shocks, but at the cost of fiscal space  
erosion in a context of high economic  
uncertainty for the years ahead. Recon-
struction is likely to be the main driver of 
the recovery in 2021, followed by a milder 
growth in private demand due to ongoing 
travel restrictions.

creased, as Albania employs a large share 
of labor in the informal economy. Despite 
the employment recovery, economic activ-ity continued to contract by 3.4 percent in 
Q3. Private consumption and investment 
declined sharply, as the number of infec-
tions consistently rose during the year. 
Declining garment processing orders led a sharp decline of 6.7 percent of goods ex-
ports, while tourist visits decreased by 60 
percent.  
Poverty (at USD 5.5 per day) is estimated 
to have increased in 2020 by 1 percentage 
point, equivalent to 28 thousand new 
poor. Response measures included in-
creased social assistance benefits, wage 
subsidies, credit guarantees to ease sala-ry payments and working capital, which 
are estimated to have prevented a further 
poverty increase of about 1.7 percentage points.  Tax deferrals and further VAT 
exemptions were introduced to help 
SMEs, while public spending rose to 33.7 percent of GDP and public revenues 
slumped to 26.7 percent of GDP, despite 
large grants financing reconstruction. The fiscal stimulus package increased 
public debt to 80 percent of GDP, a first -
time increase since 2017, as the fiscal rule 
mandates that debt -to-GDP ratio should 
decline annually2.  
  
Outlook  
 Tourism and travel are likely to remain 
limited until global vaccination rollout is completed. In this scenario, GDP is fore-
casted to grow by 4.4 percent in 2021 as 
exports, consumption and investment partially rebound. The services sector, led 
by tourism, and construction are expected 
to be key drivers of the recovery, in part thanks to reconstruction investment, fol-
lowing evidence from similar disasters in 
developing economies. Poverty is ex-
pected to decline in line with the recovery 
by about 2 percentage points. In the years following, private consumption will play an increasingly important role in growth, 
supported by reconstruction efforts. Pri-
vate investment will contribute to growth, provided that the government continues 
to implement business climate reforms. 
Beyond 2021, government spending will likely be constrained by limited fiscal 
space. The fiscal situation could deterio-
rate in a downside growth scenario and in the absence of expanded revenue collec-
tion. In this case, the government may 
need to further reduce capital spending to 
keep the debt to GDP ratio from rising.  The current account deficit is expected to narrow to 8.8 percent of GDP in 2021 and 
further decline to 6.5 percent in line with 
the pre -crisis trends, driven by projected 
improvements in the trade balance. Ser-
vice exports, including tourism and fast -
expanding business-process operations 
should narrow the trade deficit over the 
medium term. Import growth will be high at 13 percent in 2021, as infrastructure 
investment speeds up.  
With economic activity picking up, reve-
nues are projected to recover to 27.6 per-
cent of GDP by 2022 -2025. Albania ’s pub-
lic debt is projected to only marginally 
decrease to 79.5 percent of GDP in 2021. 
The employment outlook is largely de-
pendent on the recovery of the services sectors and reconstruction, where jobs are 
mostly low pay and vulnerable to eco-
nomic uncertainty.

44 MPO  Apr 21  Key conditions and 
challenges  
 
Before the coronavirus pandemic, Arme-
nia was making gradual improvements to 
its business environment and establishing a track record of prudent economic man-
agement, underpinned by a robust fiscal 
rule, an inflation -targeting monetary poli-
cy framework, and improving financial 
sector oversight. The authorities launched 
an ambitious reform program aimed at 
strengthening governance in 2018. Eco-
nomic growth was strong, averaging 6.4 percent in 2018 and 2019.  
Despite Armenia ’s reform progress, struc-
tural challenges have prevented the coun-try from reaching its full potential. These include governance gaps such as incom-
plete judicial reform, weak connectivity 
(resulting in limited trade integration and undiversified trade patterns), an aging 
population, and a labor market character-
ized by high unemployment, pervasive informality, and skills mismatches. A 
tense geopolitical situation exacerbates 
these challenges.  
Armenia ’s progress was derailed in 2020 
by twin shocks: the worst military con-
frontation with Azerbaijan since 1994 and the coronavirus pandemic. Armenia 
suffered a severe COVID -19 outbreak, 
ranking 27th globally in recorded cases 
per million population. Meanwhile, the 
country’s conflict with Azerbaijan escalat-
ed dramatically in September 2020. Alt-
hough the November 10th ceasefire halted hostilities, Armenia has since entered a 
period of heightened domestic political 
instability.  
These twin shocks led to a sharp economic contraction, increased poverty, and a fiscal 
deterioration. Nevertheless, Armenia maintained overall macroeconomic stabil-
ity and healthy external buffers through 
the crisis.  
 
 
Recent developments  
 
Real GDP contracted by 7.6 percent in 
2020. Services —trade and the hospitality 
sector, in particular —were most affected, 
contracting by 10 percent. Reflecting struc-tural challenges, for the fifth consecutive 
year agricultural output fell (by 4 percent). 
On the demand side, private consumption and investment slumped, while the drag 
from net exports eased as the decline in 
imports outpaced that of exports.  
The pandemic ’s impact on vulnerable 
households, which has been severe, was only partially mitigated by the govern-ment’s COVID -19 response (estimated at 
3.5 percent of GDP, including support 
through the banking sector to businesses). 
The poverty rate (measured at the upper -
middle -income economy poverty line) is 
estimated to have jumped to over 51 per-cent in 2020, a 7 percentage point rise. The 
unemployment rate rose by 1 percentage 
point year on year, reaching 18.1 percent at end -September 2020. Somewhat effec-
tive mitigation measures implemented by the government and the relatively short duration of pandemic -related restrictions ARMENIA

 In 2020, Armenia experienced one of the 
region’s sharpest GDP contractions —7.6 
percent—as a severe COVID -19 outbreak 
and a military conflict with Azerbaijan 
late in the year impacted performance. 
Poverty is estimated to have increased by 
7 percentage points in 2020. The econom-
ic recovery will be gradual, with output 
reaching pre -COVID levels by 2023, as-
suming that the pandemic is contained, and regional stability maintained. Risks 
to the recovery include a slow pace of im-
munization and elevated political  
uncertainty.

45 MPO  Apr 21  prevented an even greater increase in un-
employment.  
The budget deficit widened sharply to 5.1 
percent of GDP in 2020 (from 0.8 percent of GDP in 2019), driven by increased 
spending associated with the govern-ment’s pandemic response, higher mili-
tary spending, and depressed tax reve-nues. The deficit was financed by a depos-its drawdown and increased public bor-
rowing, prompting Armenia to invoke its 
fiscal rule ’s escape clause as public debt 
rose above the statutory level of 60 per-
cent of GDP.  
Inflation remained subdued through most 
of 2020, reflecting weak aggregate de-
mand. However, price pressures accelerat-
ed in December and reached 5.3 percent in February 2021, prompting the Central 
Bank of Armenia (CBA) to raise its policy 
rate. The recent uptick in inflation was driven by an increase in international food 
prices and exchange rate depreciation 
pass -through.  
The current account deficit narrowed in 
2020 as import compression and higher 
official grants offset a sharp decline in export earnings and weaker remittances. 
FDI contracted further from a low base, 
but higher public sector external borrow-
ing boosted foreign exchange reserves (which provided 4.7 months of import 
cover at end -2020). The issuance of a  $750 million Eurobond in early 2021 fur-
ther increased external buffers. The CBA 
intervened to smooth dram volatility, 
which came under pressure in late 2020 owing to political instability after remain-
ing relatively stable for most of the year.  
 
Outlook  
 
GDP growth is projected to recover par-
tially in 2021 (to 3.4 percent) and more 
strongly in 2022 (4.3 percent). The recov-
ery will be slow; the economy is unlikely 
to return to pre -COVID output levels until 
2023.  
The baseline scenario assumes that the authorities will not enact additional lock-
downs and restrictions in 2021. Although 
the pace of vaccinations will gradually ramp up, the authorities do not expect to 
vaccinate a significant share of the popula-
tion until 2022. The baseline scenario also assumes improved political stability.  
Private consumption and the services sec-tor are expected to recover gradually. Pri-vate investment will likely remain sub-
dued, reflecting weak investor confidence. 
High post -conflict spending and ambi-
tious public investment plans— although 
tempered by execution challenges —will 
keep the fiscal deficit elevated and drive the debt -to-GDP ratio above 70 percent in 
the medium term.  
Average inflation is forecast to remain 
close to the CBA ’s 4-percent target in 2021 
but could surge higher if global food and 
fuel prices continue to rise unexpectedly. The current account deficit is projected to 
remain near 5–6 percent of GDP in 2021 –
23, as recovering demand spurs import 
growth, and the global recovery boosts 
exports and remittances. FDI inflows are 
expected to remain subdued, but public borrowing will keep reserves at a comfort-
able level over the medium term.  
The COVID -19 outbreak is estimated to 
have had a devastating impact on vulner-
able households. Forecasts suggest that 48 
percent of the population will remain be-
low the $5.5 2011 PPP poverty line in 2021, 
driven by income losses, down only 
slightly from 51 percent in 2020.  
The risks to the outlook are weighted 
heavily to the downside. They include 
uncertainty over progress in containing the pandemic and the pace of vaccination, 
weak economic recovery in key trading 
partners like the Russian Federation, geo-political fragility, and heightened political 
uncertainty.

44 MPO  Apr 21  Key conditions and 
challenges  
 
Azerbaijan is an upper -middle -income 
economy rich in hydrocarbon resources. Since the 2000s, inflows of FDI to the oil and natural gas sectors have driven a 
surge in exports, propelling economic 
growth and reducing poverty. However, economic performance has stalled in 
recent years as hydrocarbon production 
plateaued and prices fell, revealing sys-
temic macroeconomic and structural 
challenges. A large state footprint, a small and fragile financial sector, and weak institutions impede economic di-
versification and the development of a 
vibrant private sector. Additionally, re-gional inequality persists, informality is 
widespread, and a considerable part of 
the population remains socially and eco-nomically vulnerable. Azerbaijan ’s hu-
man capital indicators lag its regional and income group peers. The country ’s 
human capital constraints, which trans-
late into a shortage of skilled labor, 
could worsen with more automation in 
the future.  
Simmering tensions with Armenia esca-
lated into a military conflict in late 2020. In addition to a significant human toll, 
the conflict also inflicted high socio -
economic and environmental costs. Nu-
merous facilities, infrastructure and resi-
dential areas were destroyed or dam-
aged, and natural habitats devastated.  
  
Recent developments  
 
In 2020, Azerbaijan was hit by the triple 
shocks of the COVID -19 pandemic, re-
duced oil prices, and the armed conflict.  
The economy experienced its second re-
cession since 2015, contracting by an esti-mated 4.3 percent. Three waves 
of  COVID -19 induced lockdowns halted 
activity in nonhydrocarbon sectors, partic-
ularly travel, hospitality, and domestic 
trade. The energy sector contracted by 7 
percent, as adherence to OPEC+ oil pro-
duction quotas slashed oil output. On the 
demand side, investment fell by 8.3 per-cent as business confidence plummeted. Private consumption was also affected, 
but wage hikes in late -2019 prevented a 
deeper slump.  
The lockdowns were successful in con-taining new coronavirus infections and 
easing pressures on the health care sys-tem. However, a spike in new cases fol-
lowed the eventual relaxation of contain-
ment measures, prompting the authorities to alternate between loosening and tight-
ening restrictions throughout the year. 
Azerbaijan launched a COVID -19 vaccina-
tion campaign using China ’s Sinovac vac-
cine in late January 2021.  
Azerbaijan ’s consolidated budget record-
ed a large deficit of 6.5 percent of GDP in 2020, as revenues collapsed and spending 
rose, including to finance the pandemic policy response (estimated at 2.7 percent 
of GDP). The deficit was financed by State 
Oil Fund (SOFAZ) assets.  AZERBAIJAN

oil prices and production drove Azerbai-
jan’s economy into recession in 2020. 
Poverty is estimated to have risen as households experienced job losses and 
financial hardship. Azerbaijan ’s economy 
is projected to recover gradually over the 
medium term, aided by the vaccination 
effort and increased public spending. 
However, downside risks remain acute 
and stem from the possibility of a slower -
than-expected vaccine rollout, sluggish 
recovery in oil output, and persistent structural rigidities.

45 MPO  Apr 21  A narrowing merchandise trade surplus, 
together with falling services receipts 
and rising capital outflows, resulted in a 
balance of payments deficit of 5.9 per-cent of GDP in the first nine months of 
2020. The deficit was financed by in-creased sales of foreign exchange by SO-
FAZ.  
Depressed domestic demand and a sta-
ble exchange rate contained 12 -month 
inflation to 2.7 percent in 2020. The Cen-tral Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA) cut the policy rate five times during the year, 
lowering it from 7.5 percent to 6.25 per-
cent.  
Bank performance was uneven in 2020, 
suggesting that financial sector condi-tions remain fragile. Bank credit de-clined by 5 percent year on year owing 
to plummeting economic activity and the 
revocation of four banks ’ operating li-
censes.  Deposits fell by 4.4 percent year 
on year as households and firms tapped 
their savings to weather the downturn.  
Household welfare deteriorated marked-
ly in 2020. Poverty is estimated to have 
risen due to a rise in unemployment as-sociated with the recession. The number 
of unemployed increased by an estimat-
ed 124,300 persons in 2020. Fiscal 
measures only partially mitigated the pandemic ’s  n e g a t i v e  i m p a c t  o n  h o u s e -
holds.   
Outlook  
 Azerbaijan ’s economic recovery is ex-
pected to be gradual, with output return-
ing to pre -COVID -19 levels only by end -
2022. The early launch of Azerbaijan ’s 
vaccination initiative and significantly higher public post -conflict reconstruction 
spending suggest that the recovery may materialize faster than previously antici-pated.  
In 2021, an acceleration of domestic de-mand will support economic growth, but 
this will be conditional on an improved 
health situation and increased public spending. Higher oil prices are forecast to narrow fiscal deficit and help current ac-
count return to surplus. Beyond 2021, 
without major structural reforms, the pace of the economic revival is likely to be 
moderate owing to a protracted recovery 
in oil output and anticipated fiscal tight-ening (amid rising fiscal pressures).  
Inflation is projected to rise in the medium term as a recent administrative price hike passes through to prices more generally, 
and demand begins to recover. Once the 
government phases out measures to sup-
port the financial sector, some banks are likely to experience a deterioration of cap-
ital and pro fitability ratios . Downside risks to this forecast will re-
main substantial in the medium term. The 
existing oil market equilibrium is fragile 
and largely depends on the OPEC+ agree-ments. In addition, the evolution of the 
pandemic is still uncertain and will de-pend on the speed of the vaccine rollout. 
Finally, regional geopolitical risks will 
remain elevated in the foreseeable future. Significant SOFAZ reserves —over 100 
percent of GDP at end -2020 —will help 
shield the economy from these risks.  
The long -term poverty and inequality 
trajectory will depend on the severity and duration of the crisis. The longer the pan-
demic’s duration, the deeper and broader 
the impact, particularly on employment and wages in the services sector, which would lead to more severe effects on 
household welfare and poverty.  
Azerbaijan ’s recently announced 2030 
national development vision outlines a renewed, long -run commitment to ad-
dressing systemic macroeconomic, struc-
tural, and governance challenges. Ad-
dressing these challenges could unlock 
new nonhydrocarbon sources of economic growth and achieve sustainable, resilient, 
and inclusive development.

Even before COVID -19, a lack of progress 
on reforms had already contributed to a sharp slowdown, with annual GDP growth averaging 0.5 percent since 2011. 
The COVID -19 outbreak and political tur-
bulence following elections in August 
2020 have further depressed household 
and investor sentiment and contributed to 
household deposit outflows and an 18 -
percent currency depreciation against the 
US$ during 2020. At the same time, policy support may lead to further erosion of already depleted fiscal and FX buffers, 
undermining macro -financial stability. 
The possible gradual relocation of the 
export -oriented ICT sector could affect 
services exports. Economic sanctions, if further imposed, are likely to increase the costs of doing business for selected ex-
porters. Restoring economic confidence 
promptly is crucial, given the limited poli-cy buffers and large downside risks.

economy has saddled it with a low -
productivity and highly -leveraged SOE 
sector, a weak and dollarized banking sec-tor, and heavy dependence on commodity exports. Per National Bank estimates, loans 
taken by large SOEs, sometimes with ques-
tionable ability to be serviced on time, aver-aged 14 percent of GDP over the past sev-
eral years. Given the share of FX debt on 
SOE balance sheets, currency depreciation and ec onomic weakness have further weakened bank asset quality over the past 
year.  
Over the medium -term, the challenge is to 
move towards an economy less dependent on oil processing that can be competitive 
as the implicit oil import price subsidies are withdrawn with the implementation 
of Russia ’s “tax maneuver ”. Anchoring 
fiscal sustainability in the medium term 
will require SOE restructuring, and ration-
alization of the public sector wage bill and 
tax expenditures. A robust social safety net and expanded unemployment support 
will be critical for maintaining basic in-
comes of vulnerable households and facil-
itating reallocation of workers.  
  
Recent developments  
 In 2020, the economy contracted by 0.9 
percent y/y, dragged back by external 
headwinds, which were only partially offset by demand -side policy measures. 
Disagreements with Russia on oil supply terms contributed to a 1.9 percent decline in real merchandize exports y/y during Q1
-Q3 2020. The lack of mobility restrictions, 
coupled with subsidized lending to SOEs 
(about 1.6 percent of GDP) prevented a deeper contraction of industrial output, 
while sustained real wage growth sup-ported consumption. The current account 
deficit remained nearly balanced, as the 
trade surplus reached 3.2 percent of GDP.  
During the second half of 2020, forex de-
posit withdrawals and forex demand by 
households put strong pressure on the currency and banking sector liquidity, BELARUS

strictions and credit relief for state -owned 
enterprises prevented a deeper recession, while external financing needs and do-
mestic foreign exchange pressures were 
met through a drawdown of reserves and 
debt financing. Amidst the ongoing politi-
cal crisis and limited space for fiscal or monetary expansion, the outlook, in the 
absence of reforms, is for a deepening of 
the recession in 2021, and a slow recovery 
thereafter. Poverty rates are expected to 
stagnate at a low level.

49 MPO  Apr 21  accommodated by the spending of gross 
reserves (down 20.5 percent in 2020), and 
increasing banks ’ liabilities to non -
residents. The weakening currency con-tributed to an acceleration in headline 
inflation to 7.4 percent at end -2020 from 
4.7 percent in 2019. To prevent additional 
currency pressures, the National Bank 
switched from the provision of overnight loans to weekly auctions. In February 
2021, the government introduced broad -
based price controls by capping monthly 
price increases on basic food items and 
drugs.  
For the first time since 2009, the general 
government budget shifted into a deficit: 
1.2 percent of GDP. Tax revenues dropped 
by 2.6 percentage points (pp) of GDP, on lower revenues from profit tax and for-
eign trade. Spending grew by 1.9pp of 
GDP as capital expenditures and public sector wages increased by 2pp and 0.6pp 
of GDP, respectively. External public debt 
repayment pressures were alleviated by issuances of Eurobonds (US$1.25bn), RUR
-denominated bonds (US$135mln), and 
loans from Russia and the EFSD (totaling US$1 bn).  
Real household incomes grew by 4.6 per-
cent in 2020 on account of higher real 
wages (8 percent y/y), though the pace of 
disposable income growth decreased in 
the latter half of 2020. While the national poverty rate remained unchanged in 2020 
at 4.8 percent, this outcome was due to 
favorable dynamics in the Minsk City, 
Minsk, and Grodno regions. In other are-as, rates went above 6 percent. PPP 
US$5.5/day poverty remained stable at a low level (less than 1 percent).  
 
Outlook  
 
The outlook is for deepening recession 
during 2021 and weak recovery thereafter, 
assuming ongoing political tensions, con-
tinued headwinds from the Russian “tax 
maneuver ”, and lack of structural reforms. 
Recently announced tax increases – to 
contain the fiscal deficit and that of the 
pension system – will hurt an already 
struggling private sector, hit by the ab-
sence of support during the COVID -19 
shock. Elevated market interest rates and falling investor confidence will dampen domestic and foreign investment. Recent-
ly introduced price controls are unlikely 
to contain inflation but in certain circum-stances might cause shortages of some 
goods.  
A GDP contraction of 2.2 percent is pro-
jected in 2021. With weak domestic de-mand expected to persist, the recovery is 
expected to be modest in the medium term; however, slow growth will also help 
to compress imports and the current ac-
count deficit.  
The outlook is contingent on the availabil-ity of external financing. In 2021, external 
financing needs will be closed by a combi-nation of agreed debt refinancing from 
Russia and drawdown of reserves, and 
thus appears manageable. However, 2022 -
23 are more challenging, on account of 
repayments coming due of bilateral loans 
to Russia in 2022, and the principal repay-ments on Eurobonds and the nuclear 
power plant loan in 2023.  
The government ’s ability to support vul-
nerable households is expected to weaken 
as a result of limited fiscal space. Probably 
a decline in real wages and incomes will negatively affect household welfare. Yet, 
measured at the World Bank ’s US$5.5/day 
threshold, the welfare impact is projected 
to be small, with poverty rates increasing 
by 0.1pp in 2021.

Not es:Key conditions and 
challenges  
 
BiH has enjoyed macroeconomic stability 
over the last decade. However, pre -
pandemic the pace of growth has been 
below that of peer countries in Europe 
and below what is needed to converge to 
EU living standards. BiH has not devel-oped the foundations for sustainable eco-
nomic growth as its economic model re-
mains out of balance.  
The economy is driven by consumption, 
rather than production.   Investment is low, and the economy is inward -looking.   
Poverty rates have not improved accord-
ing to the latest data available from 2015 
and many people do not have a formal job –or, indeed, any job at all – which could 
cause many people to grow old in pov-erty.  
The pandemic has highlighted the chal-
lenges of BiH's complex institutional set-
up. Disbursing fiscal support to house-holds and businesses has been slow, 
which has weighed heavily on economic 
activity and could delay the recovery in 
2021. Pressures from frequent elections in combination with slow implementation of 
structural reforms continue to hold back the country ’s ability to return to growth. 
The immediate priority for BiH is to con-trol the pandemic and to minimize its economic and social impact. Addressing 
persistent unemployment and minimizing 
layoffs remain an important challenge and will be key to curbing emigration.   
Recent developments  
 
Real GDP growth is projected at -4.0 per-
cent in 2020 due to a slowdown in most 
productive sectors, a weaker external en-
vironment and high political uncertainty.  
In 2020 growth was positive in Q1 but 
after the introduction of a lockdown and 
containment measures in Q2 the economy 
faced a sudden stop as domestic and ex-ternal demand dropped.  
By Q4 2020, economic activity had some-
what improved, but growth remained in 
negative territory.  
Unemployment has recently worsened. According to official estimates, the num-ber of people in paid employment de-
creased approximately 1 percent y -o-y in 
November 2020, while the number of un-
employed increased by about 3 percent in 
the same period. Deeper labour market 
effects have been prevented by wage sub-sidy programs in both entities and other 
policy measures targeting affected eco-
nomic sectors aimed to safeguard poten-tial job losses.  
As the economy has fallen into recession 
and with low oil prices deflation has re-
turned. In December the consumer price 
index was down 1.6 percent year -on-year 
(y-o-y).  
In 2020, a fiscal deficit of 5.5 percent of GDP is expected, down from a surplus of 1.9 
percent in 2019. In 2020, revenues fell main-
ly due to the slump in tax revenue collec-
tion, while expenditures rose mainly as a result of higher spending on public wages, goods and services and social benefits.

indicators, 2020  
Sources: BiH Agency for Statistics (BHAS), World Bank staff estimate.  Sources: : LFS Q1 and Q2 2020 report, World Bank staff calculations.  Following a sharp contraction of 4 per-
cent in 2020, economic activity is ex-
pected to expand by 2.8 percent in 2021. 
As the world recovers from the COVID -
19 crisis and with the implementation of the Economic Reform program, growth is 
expected to gradually recover. The ongo-
ing crisis highlights the need to imple-
ment long -delayed structural reforms to 
achieve faster recovery. Addressing per-
sistent unemployment and countering the 
increase in layoffs that occurred during 
the pandemic is critical to reducing  
poverty. BOSNIA AND

51 MPO  Apr 21  The current account deficit is estimated to 
have worsened slightly in 2020 due to a 
drop in the services balance and re-
mittances. Total public debt, consisting largely of concessional debt, has increased 
and is estimated at 40.6 percent of GDP, while the total external debt is estimated 
at 72 percent of GDP.  
Even during the pandemic, the financial 
sector has been broadly stable. On aver-
age, banks are sufficiently capitalized and 
liquid, but their profitability is eroding.  
The latest available poverty data using the 
national poverty line is for 2015 and the 
poverty rate was estimated at 16 percent, 
very close to the 15 percent estimated for 
2011.  
The slowdown in the economy and the consequent loss of people ’s employment 
and earnings have negatively affected household welfare in 2020. Estimates show that many of those who may have 
been affected were not covered by social 
protection programs before the crisis.  
 
Outlook 
 
The outlook is marked by the implemen-
tation of measures to combat the pan-
demic. Authorities are currently focused 
on securing vaccines. As the pandemic subsides the Socio -Economic Program is 
expected to gain needed attention, mainly 
through the return of announced invest-
ments in energy and infrastructure. Con-
sumption will continue to drive growth, 
resulting in strong growth of imports. Remittances will recover in the medium 
term, and, together with progress on re-
forms, will underpin a gradual pickup in consumption and finance a significant 
part of the trade deficit. Monetary policy 
anchored to the Euro will continue to sup-port local currency stability. Safe -
guarding the banking sector will continue to be important in particular as the full  
impact of moratoria is yet to be assessed. 
Authorities have adopted budgets and secured funds to ensure necessary liquidity through credit lines via entity development 
banks to support affected businesses. As 
BiH does not have access to international markets, support from IFIs will be critical. 
As revenues recover BiH ’s fiscal deficit will 
return to surplus over the medium term.  A 
stronger push on the capital investment 
program will need to remain a high priori-
ty for the authorities ’ economic programs. 
Planned investments in energy, infrastruc-
ture, and tourism will also support job cre-
ation in those sectors after the cr isis.  
As the pandemic loses force and the econ-omy gradually recovers in 2021,  improve-
ments in labor market participation and employment will remain key for growth to translate into poverty reduction.  
There are several risks to the outlook but 
the main risk is a prolonged pandemic which could lead to lower growth rates in 
2021 than projected. In addition, the chal-lenging political environment will affect 
the implementation of the adopted socio -
economic program. The main external risk 
for BiH remains slow growth in the EU 
and political tensions in the region.

52 MPO  Apr 21  Key conditions and 
challenges  
 
Despite robust growth of 3.6 percent on 
average in the five pre-pandemic years, 
Bulgaria ’s real convergence to the average 
European Union (EU) levels remains slow. 
The country remains the poorest and the 
most inequal member of the Union. GDP per capita in PPP terms was just 53 per-
cent of the EU average, poverty was the 
third highest in the EU, and the Gini co-
efficient reached 40.8 percent in 2019, il-
lustrating limited redistribution and in-effective social policies. Against rapid aging and population decline, conver-
gence can speed up only if the productivi-
ty gap with the rest of the EU shrinks markedly. Bulgaria's growth potential is 
also undermined by governance and insti-
tutional weaknesses, as evidenced by low public confidence in institutions, poor 
quality of public services and reduced FDI 
inflows.  
The pandemic has exposed deficiencies 
in a number of public domains, including 
health care, education, social protection 
and administrative services. Insufficiency of medical staff, growing divide in edu-
cation by socioeconomic status, inade-quate and poorly targeted social assis-
tance programmes, and slow digitaliza-
tion of administrative services are among the challenges that the government is yet 
to address. Expectedly, the pandemic has 
also resulted in a deterioration of the fiscal stance, as response measures on  the national budget reached 2.4 percent of 
GDP. Unwinding some of the measures 
such as a preferential 9 percent VAT rate 
for certain goods and services may be 
challenging. In the recovery phase, the 
biggest task before policymakers would be to ensure only gradual withdrawal of 
support measures and optimal use of an 
unprecedented amount of EU funds, esti-mated at EUR 29 bn for 2021 -2027. Going 
forward, the country ’s key development 
challenge would be its transition onto a faster, more inclusive and greener growth 
path, including costly decarbonisation of a 
coal-dependent and highly energy inten-
sive economy.  
  
 
Recent developments  
 Economic performance in 2020 was large-
ly driven by the waves of domestic con-
tainment measures - the first lockdown 
between early March and mid -May and 
the second, less stringent restrictions im-posed in late November. Yet, with Bulgar-ia recording the slowest pace of vaccina-
tion in the EU - just 4.4 percent of the pop-
ulation vaccinated until Mar 11 – econom-
ic activity is not likely to return to normal before the autumn of 2021.  
GDP growth in 2020 is estimated at –4.2 
percent, as private consumption, which contracted in Q2, bounced back strongly 
in Q3. Investment shrank notably on es-calated uncertainties and savings on pub-
lic capital spending, used to partly offset 
the government ’s response package and 
automatic fiscal stabilizers. Despite  BULGARIA

Sources: National Statistical Institute and World Bank.  Source: World Bank. Notes: see Table 2.  Bulgaria’s economy was hit relatively 
mildly by the pandemic -induced crisis in 
2020, as GDP is forecast to have shrunk 
by 4.2 percent. Consumption remained 
relatively unabated as government salary 
subsidies and pension supplements pre-
vented a more severe loss of income. Yet, slow inoculation rates suggest that pan-
demic-related risks will remain high until 
at least Q3, 2021. Going forward, policy-makers would need to ensure only gradu-
al withdrawal of fiscal support measures 
and judicious use of unprecedented amount of EU funds.

53 MPO  Apr 21  the pa ndemic -induced crisis, tax and so-
cial security revenues increased 1.6 per-
cent nominally, possibly thanks to public 
sector salary increases and the growth of 
consumption in most of the year. Not-
withstanding reduced capital spending, total expenditure grew by 5.8 percent y/y, 
due largely to the fiscal support measures. 
The budget deficit thus reached 3.0 per-cent of GDP (against 1 percent in 2019), 
while public debt picked up to estimated 
25 percent against 20 percent at end -2019.   
The hardest hit sectors remain tourism 
and related activities. Overnight stays 
declined by some 56 percent y/y as foreign 
tourist arrivals fell markedly. This also 
showed its impact on external balances, as export of services declined by 32 percent y/y. As a result, the current account sur-
plus  shrank to 0.1 percent of GDP in 2020.  
The imposition of containment measures 
led to substantial disruptions to work in 
the form of work stoppages and reduced 
hours, though this was not reflected in headline unemployment that increased 
only moderately. Though the govern-
ment’s salary subsidies and pension sup-
plements helped stabilize incomes for 
some individuals, work disruptions and 
higher food prices is projected to have led 
to a moderate increase in the poverty rate from 6.3 percent in 2019 to 6.8 percent in 2020 using the upper middle income pov-erty line of US$5.50 PPP per day.  
  
Outlook  
 
The biggest risks to the outlook stem from 
the epidemiology of the virus and the government ’s vaccination program. The 
latter hinges not only on the availability of vaccines and the organization of a well -
paced vaccination process, but also on the 
population ’s perceptions towards vaccina-
tion. Skepticism against vaccines remains 
high and may decrease only with a strong-
er pro -vaccination campaign.  
Bulgaria is projected to grow by 2.6 per-
cent in 2021 and reach its pre -crisis (2019) 
level of real output in 2022. The baseline scenario assumes that vaccination in Bul-garia will gain momentum in Q2 and Q3, 
which will gradually help restore consum-
er and business confidence. With expecta-tions of reduced infection rates in the 
summer and increased inoculation in Bul-
garia’s main market, the EU, external sales 
of goods are likely to recover but tourism 
is expected to remain below pre -crisis 
levels. Drawdowns on the EU Recovery 
and Resilience Facility are n ot expected 
before Q4/2021, with limited impact on this year’s investment and growth. Even if non -
performing loans have risen mode rately 
until December, 2020 (from 6.5 percent a 
year ago to 7.4 percent) and the banking sector remains well capitalized, NPL lev-
els may pick up more steeply after the current moratorium on bank loan service 
is lifted.    
In addition to the pandemic -related chal-
lenges, upcoming general elections in ear-ly April also add to the uncertainties. 
Swift formation of a new government would be a prerequisite for the smooth 
continuity of fiscal response measures and 
the restoration of investor confidence as 
vaccination gains momentum. Delivery on 
the fiscal consolidation plans also hinges on the outcome of election.  
Barring any unforeseen developments 
with the COVID -19 virus and under the 
assumption of high vaccination rates, pov-
erty is projected to decline in 2021 to 6.3 
percent as a result of an improved econo-
my facilitating favorable labor market conditions and normalized food inflation.

54 MPO  Apr 21  Key conditions and 
challenges  
 
The large reliance on tourism has made 
Croatia highly vulnerable to adverse ex-
ternal shocks such as the current pandem-ic. GDP contraction in Croatia in 2020, at -
8.4 percent, was one of the largest in the EU. The country also suffered from two devastating earthquakes, in March and 
December 2020. Going forward, generous 
EU funding through various initiatives 
should play a key role in supporting the 
country’s economic recovery. However, 
Croatia will need to use such funds appro-priately for both reforms and investment, 
to maximize the benefits of such financing. 
While the vaccination program has start-ed, the situation remains highly uncertain 
because of vaccine supply bottlenecks, its 
effectiveness on new virus variants, and uptake levels among the population.  
At 65.2 percent of the EU27 GDP per capi-ta in 2019 (PPP), Croatia still lags behind EU peers. Strengthening long-term 
growth is critical to accelerate the income 
convergence. This will require a diversifi-
cation of the economy towards more knowledge -based sectors and addressing 
the economy ’s structural issues, including 
public sector governance, education out-comes and the efficiency of the judiciary. 
On the fiscal front, the surge in public debt in 2020, reflecting the economic 
downturn and a large fiscal stimulus 
package, calls for fiscal prudence and efforts to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of public spending over the 
coming years.  
 
 
Recent developments  
 Economic activity continued to recover at 
the end of the last year from a drop expe-rienced during the first half of 2020. How-
ever, the pace of recovery was much slow-
er compared to the summer months due to the reintroduction of social distancing 
measures. Overall, Croatia ’s real GDP is 
estimated to have contracted by 8.4 per-
cent in 2020. The tourism sector bore the 
brunt of the impact, which was reflected 
in a sharp drop in export of services. De-cline in exports of goods was, on the other 
hand, relatively moderate following re-
covery towards the end of the year. Pri-vate consumption and investment also 
strengthened in the second half of 2020, 
which further helped in cushioning the annual decline in the manufacturing sec-
tor, while construction activity continued 
to increase in 2020.  
Due to a sharp deterioration in the trade 
deficit, the current account balance is esti-
mated to have fallen to - 1.3 percent of 
GDP in 2020, after six years of surpluses.  
As a result of the fiscal stimulus, the de-
cline in employment was relatively mod-est, and administrative unemployment 
averaged 9 percent, 1.3 percentage points 
higher than in 2019. Fiscal support measures together with decline in eco-
nomic activity led to a surge in public 
debt, estimated at 87.2 percent of GDP in 2020.  CROATIA

and the reintroduction of social distancing

suffered from a second devastating earth-quake in December last year.  Progress on 
vaccination should allow for reopening poli-
cies, resulting in a gradual recovery of the 
Croatian economy led by the tourism sector. 
GDP is projected to increase by 4.7 percent in 2021, enabling poverty to return to a downward trend.

55 MPO  Apr 21  The degree of expansionary monetary 
policy increased, and the liquidity of the 
banking sector reached historical highs. 
Also, the NPLs ratio remained stable. This, however, can be partly explained by 
regulatory relief and agreed moratorium on credit obligations and should therefore 
be monitored closely.  
Results from the second round of the Rap-
id Household Assessment conducted in 
December indicate low -wage earners con-
tinue to be more affected by the crisis than 
those in the top income brackets. Also, 
nearly 30 percent of Croatian households 
reported an annual reduction in overall 
income in 2020 and approximately 80 per-
cent of households indicate inadequate savings to weather the shock from the prolonged pandemic. The situation is 
more challenging for poor and rural 
households. Poverty is estimated to have increased to 2.6 percent in 2020 – or ap-
proximately 14,000 additional Croatian living on less than $5.5 a day at 2011 PPP prices.  
 
Outlook 
 
Economic activity in Croatia is projected to 
gradually recover from the downturn expe-
rienced in 2020 growing at the average annual rate of 4.5 percent in the 2021 -2023 
period. Implementation of the vaccination 
strategy and epidemiological measures in 
Croatia and Europe are expected to put the 
pandemic under control by the summer of 
2021 allowing countries to partially lift 
travel restrictions. For Croatia this would 
result in an increase in tourist arrivals, 
and together with the recovery of its trad-ing partners, would lead to strong growth 
of exports of goods and services. Invest-
ments are projected to be supported by EU funds, including for earthquake recon-
struction. Although a pick -up in inflation 
that could reach 1.8 percent by 2023 will 
weigh in on real incomes, improved 
household sentiment and gradual labor 
market recovery could result in strength-ening of personal consumption. The eco-
nomic situation in Croatia is likely to con-
tinue improving till the end of the forecast horizon as the pandemic abates, and with 
increased uptake of EU funds. The current 
account balance is projected to return to surplus (estimated at 2.2 percent of GDP 
in 2023), following trade deficit improve-
ments.  Continued increase in economic activity and phasing -out of the fiscal sup-
port measures should reduce the fiscal 
deficit and bring public debt below 80 
percent of GDP by 2023. 
The gradual rebound of the economy is 
expected to reduce poverty.  However, the compounded impacts of the crisis and 
the low savings rate among working poor 
households could mean a longer recovery 
process for this vulnerable group com-
pared to others. Poverty is estimated to 
return to the pre -crisis level of 2.2 percent 
by 2021 and fall further to 2.0 percent by 
2023.    
The risks for the forecast are tilted to the 
downside reflecting possible prolongation 
of the pandemic and related travel re-
strictions as well as phasing out the fiscal support measures that could lead to a rise 
in unemployment. This would weaken the 
recovery and slow down the fall in the 
poverty.

56 MPO  Apr 21  Key conditions and 
challenges  
 
Georgia has a strong record of implement-
ing economic reforms and raising the living 
standards of its citizens. Economic growth has been strong —averaging 5 percent per 
annum between 2005 and 2019 —and pov-
erty (national measure) declined rapidly to 19.5 percent in 2019, almost half its 2007 
rate, spurred by sound macroeconomic 
policies and improving governance. How-
ever, the economy has not created suffi-
cient employment, and many Georgians remain engaged in low -productivity agri-
cultural activities. Georgia ’s export basket, 
which is relatively small and undiversified, underscores the economy ’s incomplete 
structural transformation. Georgia ’s human 
capital outcomes are also weak —learning 
outcomes and linkages to private sector needs are weak.  
The COVID -19 outbreak threatens to 
reverse Georgia ’s past economic gains. 
Stringent measures, including curfews, a 
ban on public transport, lockdowns, and 
border closures, allowed the country to 
contain the pandemic ’s spread in early 
2020. However, the easing of measures in 
the summer contributed to a significant second surge in late 2020 —Georgia be-
came one of the 20 most affected coun-tries in the world in terms of reported cases per million population. The author-
ities enacted a second strict lockdown 
from end -November to early February, 
leading to a reduction of COVID cases and permitting a gradual reopening of 
the economy starting March 2021.  
 
 
Recent developments  
 The economy fell into recession in 2020, 
contracting by 6.2 percent. Following a strong start to the year, economic activity 
collapsed after March as the authorities 
introduced pandemic -related lockdown 
measures. The shock has been broad -
based, but the transport, tourism, and construction sectors suffered the largest 
impacts. Job and income losses were se-
vere. The unemployment rate reached 20.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020. More than one -third of the employed were una-
ble to work at the peak of the restrictions. Poverty is estimated to have risen by 5.4 percentage points in 2020 (using the na-
tional poverty line); even as government ’s 
sizeable support package likely prevented 
an even greater increase in poverty.  
The economic shock also put pressure on the external accounts. The current account deficit reached 12 percent of GDP in the 
first nine months of 2020, driven by weak 
services exports as border closings halted 
tourist arrivals. The deficit was only par-tially offset by an improving net income 
balance and transfers from abroad —
remittances remained resilient (this could, 
however, reflect the rising formalization 
of transfers) —and a narrowing trade defi-
cit driven by  import compression as do-
mestic demand weakened. On the financ-
ing side, substantial public borrowing fully financed the gap and allowed for GEORGIA

real GDP growth  FIGURE 2  Georgia / Poverty rate and GDP per capita  
Sources: Geostat and WB staff calculations.  Source: World Bank  Note: see Table 2.    The COVID -19 pandemic hit Georgia 
hard. Mobility restrictions, a sudden halt 
to tourist arrivals, and weak external de-
mand drove an estimated economic con-
traction of 6.2 percent in 2020. The pov-
erty rate increased by an estimated 5.4 
percentage points. Job and income losses 
were severe. The fiscal deficit and public debt rose above statutory levels as the 
crisis put pressure on fiscal and external 
balances. The recovery will be gradual. 
The current forecast—with output recov-
ering to pre -COVID levels in 2022—
remains subject to considerable downside 
risks. Table 1 2020

rose to $3.9 billion by the end of 2020 
(representing nearly 5 months of goods 
and services imports). However, the exter-nal debt-to -GDP ratio jumped to 124 per-
cent of GDP by end -September, up from 
102 percent of GDP a year earlier.  
The government ’s fiscal response to the 
pandemic —estimated at over 7 percent of 
GDP —drove a widening of the fiscal deficit 
in 2020, with government spending up by 
19 percent year on year. Simultaneously, revenue collection fell by round about 4 
percent compared to 2019. As a result, the 
fiscal deficit widened to 9.7 percent of GDP 
and public debt to over 60 percent of GDP, 
above the limits prescribed by the fiscal rule, triggering the rule ’s escape clause. 
Support from development partners and 
stepped -up domestic debt issuance fully 
met the government ’s financing needs.  
Annual inflation moderated in the second half of 2020 after reaching 7 percent in 
April 2020. A modest recovery of the lari and lower oil prices helped bring inflation 
down to 2.4 percent by end -2020 (this in-
cludes 2 percentage point downward ad-
justment owing to a government utility 
subsidy). The National Bank of Georgia 
(NBG) responded by lowering its policy 
rate by 100 basis points between April and August to 8 percent, keeping it steady 
through February.  The banking sector remained profitable in 
2020 despite the frontloading of potential 
losses in March, as mandated by the NBG. 
The share of nonperforming loans rose to 2.6 percent in 2020 from 1.9 percent in 2019. An-
nual credit growth moderated but remained robust at 13 percent in December 2020.  
 
Outlook  
 
Georgia’s economy is projected to recover 
in 2021, growing by 4 percent, with the 
key baseline assumption that there are no 
further severe waves of COVID -19 infec-
tions that necessitate additional lock-downs and ongoing political impasse is resolved. The recovery will be supported 
by fiscal stimulus in the form of accelerat-
ed capital spending, tax deferrals, acceler-ated VAT refunds, and targeted support 
for the most affected businesses, as well as 
higher social spending. The fiscal deficit is expected to remain elevated at around 7 
percent of GDP in 2021. 
The external deficit is expected to narrow in 2021 compared to 2020. Still, it will re-
main high at about 11 percent of GDP as 
the services sector recovers gradually, and 
import flows pick up in line with firming economic activity. Recovering FDI and 
sustained support from international  financial institutions are expected to cover 
Georgia’s external financing needs and 
help maintain a comfortable reserves 
cushion.  
The pace of recovery beyond 2021 will be 
contingent on vaccine rollout and the res-toration of international trade and invest-
ment. Under a baseline scenario in which 
no third wave of infections materializes and a significant share of the population is 
vaccinated by 2022, economic growth 
could recover to 5.0 percent in 2022 and 2023. The baseline scenario projects that 
the fiscal deficit will narrow to reach the 
levels prescribed by the fiscal rule (3 per-
cent of GDP) by 2023. The pandemic ’s 
impact on poverty and inequality will depend on the severity and duration of the crisis and the policy response. Under 
the baseline scenario, the poverty rate is 
expected to decline gradually, returning to pre-crisis levels by 2023.  
Delayed vaccinations, further restrictions and prolonged political tensions represent the key downside risks to this outlook. 
Either scenario could lead to a slower re-
covery in 2021 and a more modest recovery in the medium term, with output not re-
turning to pre -COVID levels until 2024. A 
delayed recovery could also pose risks to 
macro -financial stability, given Georgia ’s 
high rate of dollarization, unhedged bal-
ance sheets, and high gross external debt.

Not es:Key conditions and 
challenges  
 
Since independence in 1991, Kazakhstan 
has experienced remarkable economic 
performance. Rapid growth, fueled by structural reforms, tapping of abundant 
hydrocarbon resources, strong domestic 
demand, and FDI has helped reduce pov-erty and transform the country into an 
upper middle -income economy.  
However, productivity growth has weak-
ened, averaging close to zero percent over 
the past decade, slowing down the pace of 
economic growth. Over -dependence on 
hydrocarbons makes the economy vulner-
able to external shocks, as nearly 70 pe r-
cent of country ’s export earnings comes 
from crude oil. Half of country ’s popula-
tion lives in rural, sparsely populated, and 
economically isolated areas with poor access to public services and vulnerability 
to poverty. The COVID -19 pandemic is 
likely to exacerbate the economic and so-
cial vulnerabilities.  
To support strong, sustainable, and inclu-
sive economic recovery, the authorities 
need to advance structural reforms while 
dealing effectively with the pandemic. The 
policy imperatives are multifold. The first policy priority is to diversify the economic 
base by improving competitiveness of the 
non-oil and gas sectors, including through 
reforms in the financial sector and invest-
ment policies. The second priority is to 
limit the outsized role of SOEs, enhance competition and create a level playing field for the private sector. The third prior-
ity is to improve the quality and progre s-
sivity of public spending to address ine-
quality. Finally, it would be essential to strengthen public sector institutions and 
reinforce the rule of law to attract much -
needed investment in the non -extractive 
sector.  
  
Recent developments  
 
The coronavirus pandemic and the col-
lapse in exports have taken a severe toll 
on the Kazakh economy. GDP fell for the 
first time in two decades, down by 2.6 percent in 2020. The nationwide mobility restrictions over COVID -19 led to a con-
traction in consumer demand and invest-ment. Consumer demand fell 5.0 percent along with a drop in retail trade, while 
investment dropped by 3.4 percent, large-
ly because of a sharp fall in FDI. Economic activity experienced a severe contraction 
in April -June of 2020, at the peak of re-
strictions, followed by a growth rebound 
in manufacturing, trade and transporta-
tion services in the second half of the year.  
A sharp fall in exports and commensu-
rate reduction in imports left the current account balance broadly unchanged at 
3.4 percent of GDP in 2020. NBK reserves rose by almost $6.7 bln. in December to 
reach $35.6 bln. because of higher gold 
prices, despite heavy FX market interven-tions. The tenge fell by 15 percent against 
the dollar by April 2020 because of the

The government responded early to the 
COVID -19 crisis and introduced a fiscal 
stimulus package in the size of about 6 
percent of GDP directed to SMEs and households. As a result, budget spending 
surged to an estimated 23.2 percent of 
GDP from a pre -crisis 19.5 percent. To 
fund the anti -crisis package, the govern-
ment reallocated existing budgetary funds, tapped into Oil Fund reserves and scaled up domestic borrowing. The budg-
et deficit rose to 4.0 percent of GDP from a 
1.8 percent a year earlier, and public debt 
moved up to 24.4 percent of GDP.  
In February 2021, inflation rose to 7.4 per-cent y -o-y, up from 6.0 percent a year ear-
lier, largely because of 11.6 percent in-
crease in food prices in January. Higher 
inflation also reflects the impact of the tenge depreciation. Despite higher infla-
tion, the National Bank (NBK) kept its 
policy rate at 9.0 percent in January 2021.  
Despite the crisis, the banking sector rec-
orded a positive return to assets of 2.3 
percent, thanks to strong growth in con-sumer loans, while corporate lending re-
mained subdued. Nonperforming loans 
(NPLs) remained little changed at 6.8 per-
cent of the loan portfolio in December. Government support measures, such as 
loan guarantees, moratoria, and subsi-dized loans helped halt mass corporate insolvencies during the lockdown. Howev-
er, the true size of NPLs might emerge high-
er than officially reported after the pandem-
ic, when support measures taper off . 
In 2020, the official unemployment rate 
changed little from a pre -pandemic level.  
However, the rate of temporary leave, es-
pecially among low -income workers, rose 
sharply during the national lockdowns.  As 
a result, poverty rate is estimated to have 
increased to 14 percent in 2020.  
 
Outlook  
 
Economic growth is expected to rebound 
in 2021, driven by resumption of domestic activity, recovery in global demand for oil, 
continued fiscal support measures, and a 
successful national inoculation against the COVID -19 virus.    
With the continued pace of recovery, the economy is expected to grow within 3.0 -
4.0 percent range in 2021.  
Private consumption spending is likely to pick up in 2021, driven by the release of pent -up demand as incomes rebound and 
retail lending continue apace. Higher de-
mand for housing is expected to support 
residential investment, as government 
program would allow pensioners to use 
some their savings to purchase a house or pay down mortgages. The government is likely to continue an 
expansionary fiscal stance in 2021 due to 
rising spending on social assistance, edu-
cation, and infrastructure. The nonoil defi-cit is projected to decline to nearly 9.0 per-
cent of GDP in 2021 but remain above the mid-term target of 6 percent. Government 
debt is likely to increase to 27 percent of GDP due to higher domestic borrowing and disbursement of external loans to 
finance the deficit. 
Inflation is expected to moderate in 2021, as supply disruptions and the crisis pre-
cautionary food buying wane. However, 
an expansionary fiscal stance with signifi-
cant direct lending provisions can sustain 
pressure on inflation.  
The current account deficit is projected to improve modestly, supported by stronger 
exports thanks to higher oil prices and 
rebound in global demand for oil and a gradual pick up in imports.  
Despite growth recovery, poverty rate is expected to decrease gradually before reaching to a pre -crisis level of welfare.  
However, economic recovery could lose momentum if the progress on vaccination slows, mobility restrictions last longer, 
public investments delayed, and external 
demand is weaker than expected. Busi-
ness insolvencies and layoffs could hit incomes, increase poverty, and expose the 
banking sector to higher NPLs.

Kosovo entered 2021 under continued 
pressure from the COVID -19 pandemic 
and in expectation of a government 
change following the organization of early 
elections in February 2021. Given 
healthcare capacity constraints, stringent containment measures were imposed in 
Q2 2020 but were relaxed in Q3. Vaccina-
tion has not commenced as of March 2021.  
Because diaspora -related tourism exports 
accounted for almost one -quarter of GDP 
prior to the pandemic, recovery will also depend on international travel restrictions 
and vaccination progress in diaspora host 
countries.  
Growth averaged 3.6 percent over 2009 -
2019 and, before the pandemic, was ex-pected to exceed 4 percent in the medium term. Private investment added to 
growth in recent years, but was mostly 
concentrated in trade and construction industries, with limited productivity 
spillovers.  
Likewise, robust growth did not translate 
into more jobs as the employment rate remained almost constant between 2017 
and 2019. In 2019, 21 percent of the popu-lation still lived with under US$5.5 per 
person per day (in 2011 PPP), and this 
share is expected to have increased in 2020 by 4 -5 percentage points. Poor edu-
cation and health outcomes limit the con-tribution of human capital to inclusive growth and the pandemic likely widened this gap. As a largely service and con-
sumption -based economy, Kosovo was 
particularly vulnerable to the COVID -19 
shock.  
To support the recovery in 2021, the Gov-
ernment should strengthen compliance with pandemic preventive measures, 
increase treatment capacity and effective-
ness while reducing citizens ’ out-of-
pocket costs, and boost vaccination. Tar-
geting of social protection and private 
sector support measures should be im-proved and implementation of public 
projects with secured financing accelerat-
ed. To support a resilient recovery in the 
medium term, public spending effective-
ness and the regulatory environment should be enhanced. Investment in hu-man capital should be prioritized.   
  
Recent developments  
 In 2020, economic activity is estimated to 
have contracted by 6.9 percent, driven by 
a plunge in exports —principally   because 
of a 51 percent drop of diaspora travel 
services—and investment. Consumption 
contributed modestly, with higher gov-
ernment offsetting lower private con-sumption. Fiscal stimulus combined with 
increased remittances and goods exports cushioned the contraction.  
Consumer price inflation decelerated in 2020 to 0.2 percent because of weak do-mestic demand and declining import 
prices.  
Formal employment weathered the im-
pact of the downturn, but compensation KOSOVO

Sources: Kosovo agency of statistics and World Bank staff calculations.  Source: World Bank.  Economic activity contracted by 6.9 per-
cent in 2020, driven by plunging diaspora 
tourism and lower investment. Govern-
ment and Central Bank policy support 
measures coupled with higher remittances 
and goods exports mitigated the contrac-
tion. The recovery should start in 2021 
with growth hovering above 4 percent in 
the medium term. However, real economic activity should recover losses only in 
2022.  Addressing long -standing struc-
tural impediments and prioritizing lim-ited fiscal space for high -return human 
capital investments is vital to supporting a resilient recovery.

tered unemployment increased, most like-
ly from informal job losses. Overall, un-
employment remains high at 25 percent of the labor force (46.9 percent of youth) in 
Q3 2020. Projections suggest a poverty increase of 4 -5 p.p. in 2020 (70 -90 thou-
sand new poor). The expected return to growth in 2021 should modestly reduce poverty as the services sector recovers.  
Despite a 28.4 percent reduction in public investment, the budget deficit closed 2020 at 7.6 percent of GDP, due to lower public 
revenues against the contraction. Current 
spending increased by 18.6 percent, driv-
en by pandemic-related spending of an 
estimated 4.4 percent of GDP. The deficit was financed primarily through domestic and external debt and liquidation receipts.  
The drop in imports and a rise in second-ary income almost compensated the plunge in exports during 2020. As a result, 
the current account deficit (CAD) deterio-
rated marginally from 5.5 to 5.7 percent of GDP. CAD was primarily financed by net 
FDI inflows and other international debt -
driven investment flows.  
Bank deposits and bank credit increased by 11.5 and 7.1 percent, respectively. 
New loans increased only by 1.8 percent, 
reflecting restructuring activity through-out the year. Capital adequacy is above 
regulatory requirements, while NPLs increased by 0.7 p.p. Forbearance 
measures by the Central Bank cushioned 
the impact of the pandemic on the finan-
cial sector.  
 
Outlook  
 
Growth is projected to reach 4 percent in 
2021. The recovery is expected to be grad-
ual. Economic activity will reach pre -
pandemic levels only in 2022, mainly driv-
en by a rise in exports and consumption. 
Growth in goods exports should continue 
to be strong in the medium term, as base 
metal prices are expected to rise. Service exports should also recover driven by a recovery in diaspora -related tourism ex-
ports, as international travel restrictions are relaxed, and vaccination accelerates in Europe.  
Economic growth is projected to remain over 4 percent in the medium term, but downside risks to the outlook are high. 
The projected outlook rests on the as-
sumption of relaxed international mobility between Europe and Kosovo, no further 
strict local containment measures and a 
recovery in Euro Area growth. There is 
also potential for higher growth, including through faster implementation of IFI -
financed public investment.  Fiscal deficit will remain elevated in 2021 projected at 5.1 percent of GDP, driven by 
fiscal stimulus measures and the disrup-
tion in the growth trajectory induced by the pandemic. Revenues are expected to 
recover as growth picks up. Fiscal stimu-lus aimed at supporting businesses and 
livelihoods should be fully executed in 
2021, at about 3.2 percent of GDP.  
The CAD should remain at 5.7 percent of 
GDP in 2021 and gradually improve over 
the medium -term. Goods exports should 
increase gradually, while imports also 
increase on the back of higher aggregate 
demand. The size CAD will be deter-
mined by the pace of remittance growth 
and recovery of diaspora -related tourism 
exports.  
The pandemic has intensified the develop-
mental gaps, hence progress on structural 
reforms, including improvements in the design and targeting of social protection 
spending and regulatory environment for 
businesses is vital in reversing the adverse economic and social impact of the pan-
demic and building resilience against fu-
ture negative shocks.

challenges  
 
The Kyrgyz Republic was making strides 
toward macroeconomic stability before the 
COVID -19 pandemic. Real GDP growth 
averaged 4 percent over the last decade, 
average inflation was low at 1.1 percent 
and the fiscal deficit was reduced to 0.5 percent of GDP in 2019. As a result of debt 
forgiveness from the Russian Federation 
and prudent debt management policy, gov-
ernment debt fell to 52 percent of GDP at 
end-2019 from 67 percent in 2015.  
The Kyrgyz som was broadly stable against the U.S. dollar, and the country ’s 
foreign exchange reserves were equivalent to 6 months of import cover in December 2019.  
However, the Kyrgyz economy has re-mained vulnerable to external shocks ow-ing to its heavy dependence on remittanc-
es (27 percent of GDP) and gold exports (9 
percent of GDP). Together with political instability, these vulnerabilities have re-
sulted in volatile economic growth. Con-
sequently, it has been insufficient to raise 
living standards or reduce poverty. Sub-stantial import spending for investment 
kept the current account deficit high (12 percent of GDP).  
Strong and sustainable economic growth requires institutional strengthening and policies to develop the private sector, 
spur international trade, and encourage 
fiscally sustainable energy production. Constraints to private investment and growth include the large infrastructure 
gap, weak rule of law and governance, 
poor business environment, and onerous 
regulations. The energy sector ’s financial 
weaknesses—stemming from below -cost 
recovery tariffs and a failure to meet WTO 
and Eurasian Economic Union standards 
and technical regulations —further limit 
the Kyrgyz Republic ’s growth potential. 
  
Recent developments  
 
The March –May 2020 lockdown, which 
included border closures to contain the 
spread of COVID -19, was a major shock to 
the Kyrgyz economy, significantly reduc-ing household incomes and business reve-
nues. In October 2020, political turmoil 
worsened the country ’s investment cli-
mate. As a result —and despite the easing 
of lockdown restrictions later in the year—real GDP contracted by 8.6 percent in 2020. Twelve -month inflation rose to 9.7 
percent in December (from 3.1 percent a year earlier), primarily driven by ex-change rate depreciation (19 percent). The 
current account is estimated to have run a 
surplus of 4 percent of GDP in 2020, re-
flecting a 30 percent contraction in im-ports and resilient export earnings that — 
supported by gold exports —declined only 
by about 2 percent. Remittances remained at 2019 levels. Gross official reserves re-
mained adequate at 5.9 months of imports as the central bank purchased domestical-
ly-produced gold to offset sales of foreign 
exchange ($518 million, three times as 
much as in 2019) to limit som volatility.

the policies to limit its impact, and the  domestic political turmoil. External trade 
declined sharply, and the fiscal position 
deteriorated. The poverty rate is estimated 
to have more than doubled compared to the precrisis period. GDP growth is fore-
cast to recover in 2021, assuming that 
domestic economic activity picks up and 
external trade resumes as the pandemic 
wanes, political stability is maintained, 
and external demand recovers.  KYRGYZ

63 MPO  Apr 21  The central bank raised the policy interest 
rate by 75 basis points to 5 percent in Feb-
ruary 2020 in response to higher inflation. 
The rate has remained unchanged since even with inflation trending higher in the 
fourth quarter. Reflecting heightened un-certainty, the central bank allowed greater 
exchange rate flexibility, eased regulatory 
requirements for commercial banks, and provided additional liquidity. This stance 
was appropriate to absorb the COVID -19 
shock and support economic activity.  
Surging expenditures and weaker reve-nues drove a widening of the general 
government deficit in 2020, to 4.2 percent 
of GDP (from 0.5 percent in 2019). The 
fiscal easing was appropriately aimed at supporting private enterprises and ad-dressing health and social needs. Tax 
payment deferments and temporary tax 
exemptions for crisis -affected businesses 
resulted in a decline of 1.4 percent of 
GDP in tax revenues. An increase in 
grant receipts partially offset the tax shortfall. Spending increased by 2.2 per-
cent of GDP, driven by increased com-
pensation to medical workers, and spending on medicines, personal protec-
tive equipment, and other medical mate-
rials. The higher deficit —together with 
the GDP contraction and som deprecia-tion— drove an increase in public debt  to 
68 percent of GDP in December 2020.  The combined health and economic shocks of 2020 drove up poverty and  
diminished social welfare. A significant 
share of the population is vulnerable and at risk of falling into poverty due to lower 
incomes, higher food prices, or job losses. The poverty rate is estimated to have 
more than doubled in 2020 from 9.7 per-
cent in 2019 (US$ 3.2/day, 2011 PPP).  
 
 
Outlook  
 
The coronavirus pandemic and the politi-
cal turmoil have weakened the Kyrgyz 
Republic ’s macroeconomic outlook, with 
medium -term growth projections below 
prepandemic forecasts. Real GDP is pro-
jected to recover to its pre -pandemic level 
only by 2023; the recovery is expected to 
take even longer in real GDP per capita 
terms.  Our baseline scenario projects real 
GDP growth of 3.8 percent in 2021 as eco-nomic activity recovers, driven by services 
and construction. Growth is forecast to 
increase to an average of 4.4 percent in 2022 –23. This scenario assumes a reduc-
tion of new COVID -19 cases as vaccines 
are deployed, that political stability is 
maintained, and external demand and 
trading conditions improve. With the sta-
bilization of the exchange rate, average inflation is expected to moderate to 5.4 
percent. The current account deficit is pro-
jected to widen to about 7 percent of GDP 
in 2021, reflecting a faster pace of import recovery relative to export growth.  
The fiscal deficit is projected to narrow to 
3.9 percent of GDP in 2021, driven by high-
er tax revenues thanks to economic recov-
ery and the expiration of tax deferments and exemptions. Over the medium term, 
the authorities are targeting a fiscal deficit 
of 3 percent of GDP. Fiscal consolidation requires measures to expand the tax base, 
roll back pandemic -related expenditures, 
streamline nonpriority purchases, and re-
duce the wage bill as a share of GDP.  
Under a downside scenario, which as-
sumes a continued impact of COVID -19 
owing to a delay in vaccine availability and 
the reemergence of political instability, real 
GDP is expected to grow by only 1.5 per-cent in 2021, with the current account and 
fiscal deficits deteriorating to around 10 
percent and 4.5 percent of GDP, respective-ly. 
The poverty rate is projected to remain elevated in 2021 –22 as households continue 
to face the pandemic's impacts. The social 
assistance system will remain under pres-
sure as social transfers support poor and 
vulnerable groups. Existing social protec-tion programs will require scaling up to 
help the population cope with the shock.

64 MPO  Apr 21  Key conditions and 
challenges  
 
Despite solid economic performance in 
recent years, Moldova has fallen short of 
its aspiration to achieve faster conver-gence towards EU income levels. The eco-
nomic model continues to be reliant on 
remittances -induced consumption. Declin-
ing productivity growth resulting from 
deep structural and governance weak-
nesses constitutes a key challenge. State 
enterprises have a significant footprint 
and lower productivity than the private sector, while the business environment, anticompetitive practices, and taxes dis-
tort private initiatives. The bank fraud of 
2014 uncovered deep weaknesses in the financial sector.  
Moldova has one of the highest COVID -19 
infection and death rates per population in Europe. Despite the restrictive 
measures, the number of cases has been 
rising progressively on the back of low enforcement and compliance.  
The global recession, disruptions in sup-
ply chains, measures to flatten the conta-
gion curve, financial risk aversion, 
among others, are taking a heavy toll on 
the key components of aggregate de-mand. While the medium -term growth 
prospects remain positive, a sustained recovery hinges on the containment of the pandemic and favorable external en-
vironment. A new wave of restrictions in 
the country and in the main trading part-ners may further reduce consumer and business confidence leading to even lower 
remittances and exports. On the fiscal side, 
though the 2021 budget envisages an ambi-
tious fiscal stimulus, it might not be 
enough in case of slow roll -out of vaccines 
and limited foreign financing.  Domestic 
risks relate to political instability, institu-tional weaknesses, and political con-
straints to implement reforms of the judi-ciary and structural reforms. Fragile eco-
nomic conditions and low productivity 
levels are exacerbated by the large foot-print of the state in the economy, shrink-
ing fiscal space, low financial inter -
mediation and governance challenges. Ad-
ditionally, as shown by the severe drought 
episode in 2020, the economy is highly vul-
nerable to extreme weather episodes.  
  
 
Recent developments  
 The combination of the pandemic and the severe drought is expected to affect most 
sectors of the economy. The economic 
activity plummeted in 2020, with GDP declining by 7.0 percent. Primary drivers 
of this deceleration are households ’ con-
sumption, which declined by  
7 percent in 2020, and investments togeth-er with de -stocking.  
The lockdown measures have halted 
trade and industrial production while a 
severe drought has resulted in a decline 
in agriculture production by over 26 percent. Since the end of the lockdown, 
the economy has started to rebound grad-
ually, but most of the short -term indic a-
tors remain in the negative  territory.  MOLDOVA

the outlook for Moldova with a significant 
recession in 2020. Beyond 2020, high 
uncertainty on the duration of the pan-
demic and its economic and social ramifi-
cations could further constrain firms, 
workers and households, hampering the 
recovery. If downside risks materialize, 
reduced fiscal space may limit the capaci-
ty for further countercyclical measures.

65 MPO  Apr 21  On the back of falling import prices and 
domestic demand, inflation has decelerat-
ed markedly in 2020, fluctuating below 
the lower band of the corridor of 5 percent (+/- 1.5 percent) since August. In response, 
the National Bank cut the prime rate 5 
times to a new record low of 2.65 percent. 
The large import compression has led to 
an improvement in the current account deficit, which was mainly financed by 
debt instruments, predominantly public.  
On this background, fiscal stance deterio-
rated substantially. From pre -COVID -19 
level, tax revenue increased by about 0.3 pp of GDP while spending increased by 
4.1 pp of GDP. As a result, the fiscal defi-
cit reached 5.1 percent of GDP in 2020.  
Employment dropped by 0.5 percent in the last quarter of 2020, with the most 
affected sectors being trade and hospital-
ity, follo wed by agric ulture and ind ustry. 
Job losses, together with declining earn-
ings, the return of the most vulnerable 
economic migrants, and rising food pric-es have led to increased strain on house-
holds' finances. As a result, poverty, as 
measured by the US$5.50 PPP a day, is projected to increase from an estimated 
10.6 percent in 2019 to an estimated 14.2 
percent in 202 0.   
  
  
Outlook  
 
Uncertainties around the evolution of the 
pandemic will keep the economy below potential. Economic growth is expected to 
rebound to 3.8 percent in 2021, assuming 
favorable conditions thanks to the rollout of vaccines. Consumer and investment 
confidence are expected to improve on the 
back of favorable external conditions, in-crease in social transfers, and accommoda-
tive monetary stance. Most sectors are 
expected to bounce back, though the 2019 
levels are estimated to be reached only in 
2022. The agricultural sector is expected to rebound strongly after a bad yield in 2020. While the current account deficit is ex-
pected to have narrowed in 2020, it will 
gradually widen as the economy acceler-ates. Inflation is expected to remain lower 
than the target corridor of 5 percent +/ - 1.5 
pp in 2021 -22 but to pick up as the recov-
ery strengthens.  
The authorities plan the fiscal deficit to 
reach 6.3  percent of GDP in 2021 and will 
remain higher than historical averages in 
the medium term due to a decline in reve-
nues as businesses struggle and house-holds suffer from weak job creation.  
Public debt is expected to increase (by 9.1 
pp of GDP from pre -COVID -19 level) to 
36.5 percent of GDP in 2021, while still remaining relatively low by international 
standards. The government faces consid-erable financing needs which might be 
difficult to meet domestically despite ag-
gressive monetary loosening. The capacity to mitigate the impact of the crisis and 
support economic recovery will critically 
depend on external financing, particularly a successful renegotiation on an IMF pro-
gram.  
Under the assumption of an economic 
rebound in Moldova and its main migrant 
destination countries, poverty, as meas-
ured by the US$5.50 PPP/day poverty line, is projected to decline from 14.2 percent in 
2020 to 12.3 percent in 2021. Going for-
ward, Moldova will need to address the inequality of opportunities and accelerate 
private sector -driven job creation.

66 MPO  Apr 21  Key conditions and 
challenges  
 
As a small, open, and heavily tourism -
dependent economy, Montenegro was hit hard by COVID19, affirming its vulnera-bilities to strong boom -bust cycles.   
Over the five years prior to the crisis, growth averaged 4 percent, driven by large public investments and consump-
tion. Over two -thirds of Montenegro ’s 
jobs are in services, which account for 
over 70 percent of value added. The exter-
nal imbalances are structurally high and 
averaged 15 percent of GDP over 2015 -19, 
largely financed by net FDI and external 
debt. Montenegro ’s net international posi-
tion at negative 170 percent of GDP is 
amongst the largest in the world. Due to 
weaker adherence to fiscal plans and debt -
financed highway construction, public 
debt has doubled since independence. 
Montenegro aspires to join the EU, but 
significant rule of law challenges slow down progress and reflect a key develop-
ment constraint.  
The crisis has wiped out recent economic 
and social gains from the period of strong growth and exacerbated Montenegro ’s 
vulnerabilities. These include: the lack of 
fiscal space, small production base and 
low diversification of the economy, busi-
ness environment weaknesses, and in-come and social inequalities. These vul-
nerabilities translate into significant rever-
sals of progress in creating jobs, raising income, and reducing poverty.  Montenegro ranks third in the number of 
infections per million inhabitants and rec-
ords among the highest death rates per 
capita from COVID -19 in the world. The 
pace of recovery will depend on when the 
pandemic is contained and the pace of immunization, which is currently slow.  
In 2020, the country saw the first demo-cratic change of power. The new govern-ment committed to accelerating reforms, 
strengthening the rule of law, and fighting 
corruption. These, coupled with strong fiscal and debt management and inde-
pendent and accountable state institu-
tions, would enable more inclusive, pri-
vate sector -led growth and efficient ser-
vice delivery to citizens.  
 
Recent developments  
 
In 2020, tourism plummeted due to 
COVID19: foreign tourist overnight stays and receipts collapsed by 90 percent. Con-
sequently, retail trade fell by almost 17 
percent, while industrial production was at 2019 levels.  
Administrative data show employment 
was down to a 9 -year low, with the tour-
ism, construction, and trade sectors hit 
hardest. Unemployment went up by 13 
percent.  Wage subsidies and one -off cash 
transfers helped to avoid even larger 
layoffs and increases in poverty, though 
vulnerable workers in the informal sector might not have received much support. 
Poverty (income below $5.5/day in 
2011PPP) is estimated to increase from 14.5 percent in 2019 to 20 percent in 2020.    MONTENEGRO

Sources: MONSTAT, World Bank projections  Source: World Bank. Note: see Table 2.  Montenegro suffered a very deep recession 
in 2020, estimated at 15 percent. The cri-
sis exposed Montenegro ’s structural chal-
lenges and vulnerabilities, reversing eco-nomic and social gains of recent years. 
Despite government support, employment 
fell across all sectors, and poverty is esti-
mated to have increased to 20 percent. 
Public debt soared to over 100 percent of GDP, requiring vigilant fiscal manage-
ment in the years ahead. The economy is 
projected to rebound in 2021, but GDP 
will not fully recover before 2023.

67 MPO  Apr 21  In 2020, general government revenues 
declined by 13 percent, strongly driven by 
declines in VAT ( -24 percent). General 
government spending went up by 4.6 per-cent, partly due to support measures, 
while capital spending fell by 25 percent. In December, Montenegro placed a 7 -year 
EUR750 million Eurobond, with an inter-est rate of 2.875 percent to pre -finance 
maturing debt and 2021 fiscal deficit.  
The financial sector was resilient in 2020: outstanding loans (including those in moratoria) were up by 3 percent, while 
deposits fell by 3 percent, driven by de-
clining household deposits. Yet, new lend-
ing was down by 26 percent and bank 
profits declined by over 50 percent. In December, non -performing loans edged to 
6 percent of total loans and the capital 
adequacy ratio was at 18.59.3 percent.  
As exports plunged and imports showed 
more resilience, the current account deficit 
widened to 26 percent of GDP. Net FDI 
increased by 50 percent (due to smaller outflows, as buying -back of EPCG shares 
finalized in 2019), covering almost 40 per-cent of the CAD, with debt and deposit draw -down financing the rest of it. In De-
cember, international reserves (stronger 
due to the Eurobond) covered 10 months 
of merchandise imports.     
Outlook  
 
The blurred outlook due to the pandemic 
developments and vaccine rollouts is fur-ther dimmed by unclarity on the govern-
ment’s medium -term plans. Due to a low 
base and assuming tourism recovers to 55 
percent of 2019 levels, Montenegro ’s econ-
omy is expected to rebound in 2021 with an estimated GDP growth of 7.1 percent.  
The total output loss is, however, project-
ed to be fully recovered only in 2023 when 
the economy is expected to grow 3.5 per-
cent.  
External imbalances will remain elevated in 2021, but the finalization of the import -
dependent motorway section and stronger 
exports led by the tourism recovery are 
projected to reduce the current account deficit to 13 and 10 percent of GDP in 2022 
and 2023, respectively. After peaking at 
105 percent of GDP in 2020, public debt is estimated to return to pre -crisis levels by 
2023. However, the actual debt reduction trajectory might be steeper or flatter, de-pending on the government ’s medium -
term budgetary plans which are still un-
known, as it delayed the 2021 budget 
adoption. However, implementation of sound and credible fiscal policies is an 
imperative for debt sustainability.  
The outlook on employment is also highly 
uncertain and depends on the recovery of labor -intensive sectors. The speed of re-
covery of low -skill jobs will partly deter-
mine how fast poor and vulnerable house-holds can return to pre -crisis income lev-
els. The poverty rate is projected to de-
cline to 17.9 percent in 2021.  
The current crisis has made the longstand-ing policy priority of improving economic resilience more urgent than ever.  
In order to accelerate recovery and sustain inclusive growth and poverty reduction, 
Montenegro must keep macroeconomic 
stability, ensure inclusive and efficient provision of public services, carefully manage its natural resources and strength-
en the independence and capacities of its 
institutions. The government decisions to tackle the SOE governance issues are im-
portant steps in the right direction.

68 MPO  Apr 21  Key conditions and 
challenges  
 
North Macedonia has enjoyed a period of 
relative macroeconomic stability over the 
last decade, accompanied by rising trade integration, especially in GVCs, an im-
proved business environment and inflow 
of foreign direct investment. While this has resulted in an average GDP growth of 
2.6 percent in the period 2010 -2019, it was 
still lower than in peer countries.  
Poverty declined in recent years, but 
about 16.8 percent of Macedonians (using 
the US$5.5/day at 2011 PPP line) were still projected to live in poverty in 2019. Hit by 
the pandemic and the related recession, it 
is estimated that poverty increased be-tween 1 and 4 percentage points in 2020. 
Support measures introduced by the gov-
ernment (i.e., subsidies and social security contributions to private firms and cash 
benefits and vouchers for vulnerable peo-
ple) helped alleviate the impact of the pandemic on poverty.  
Outlook for the near term, although posi-
tive, remains challenging as a result of 
continued containment measures in place, 
slow vaccine rollout, and unresolved 
structural bottlenecks. Human capital development is limited as a result of weak 
education and workforce skills acquisition 
which, together with low and declining productivity, has been constraining 
growth. This has only been further exacer-
bated by the learning loss caused by COVID -19. In addition, labor resources are underutilized as only 48 percent of 
working -age Macedonians are employed, 
while low birth rates and emigration are 
shrinking the workforce.  
The transition to a more dynamic econom-
ic model and, with it, the creation of job opportunities for the youth is linked to the 
implementation of key social sector, eco-
nomic, and governance reforms in a con-text of political stability, increased trans-
parency, accountability, voice and partici-
pation. The current economic model, based on generous public support through 
subsidies and broad and growing tax ex-
emptions, is not sustainable and has led to 
an ever -increasing state involvement in 
the market. Countercyclical fiscal policies put in place to mitigate the impact of COVID -19 depleted the fiscal buffers and 
increased sustainability concerns. As the economic recovery firms up, a gradual withdrawal of the state support will be 
necessary. Finally, further delays in the 
opening of the EU accession negotiations may reduce willingness to undertake 
structural reforms.  
 
 
Recent developments  
 
Growth declined by 4.5 percent in 2020; 
less than earlier projected as the recession sharply eased in Q4. Private consumption, 
the main driver of growth in the past, ex-
perienced a sharp decline of 5.6 percent y -
o-y as a result of containment measures. 
Investment also declined by more than 10 percent, even though it shortly rebounded in Q3. Government consumption that

4.5 percent in 2020—the largest since inde-
pendence. Government response measures 
partially mitigated the crisis impact on 
households and firms, but the fiscal deficit 
tripled to 8.9 percent of GDP, and debt 
reached 60 percent of GDP. The near -term 
outlook is positive, but downside risks are 
high. While economic and social measures to 
remedy the crisis will take priority in early 2021, fiscal, competition, environmental and governance reforms are needed for re-covery and EU accession.  NORTH

unchanged compared to 2019. On the pro-
duction side, agriculture, ICT and real estate activities were only sectors growing 
in 2020.  
Government support helped cushion the 
crisis impact on the labor market by sup-
porting over 130,000 jobs through wage 
subsidies in April, declining to 60,000 to-
wards the year -end as the economy slowly 
recovered. The unemployment rate re-mained largely unchanged, but this was partly a result of people dropping out of 
the labor market. The activity rate 
dropped by 0.8 pp to 56.4 percent, the lowest level since 2008.  
The banking sector liquidity ratio of over 23 percent in Q3 remained adequate, helped by the central bank measures. 
Credit continued growing at 4.7 percent 
y-o-y by end -2020, on account of both 
household and firm credits supported by 
strong deposit growth and crisis -support 
programs. Non -performing loans de-
clined to 3.3 percent given the allowed suspension on credit reclassification re-
quirements until December. However, an upward correction is expected in 2021 as 
this measure ended. The capital adequacy 
ratio stood at 16.9 percent in Q3 2020, 
double the mandatory level. Inflation re-
mained low at 1.2 percent y -o-y in 2020, 
reflecting subdued output and despite 
rising food prices in the second half of 
2020.  
The fiscal deficit tripled to 8.9 percent of 
GDP in 2020. The drop in VAT and excise 
revenues amounted to 0.9 percent of GDP 
and was cushioned somewhat by an in-crease in social contributions. Spending 
increased by 4.4 percent of GDP, as health 
expenditures and subsidy schemes, aimed 
at employment retention, surged. Spend-
ing on wages and pensions also increased as a result of previous policy changes, while capital spending declined. Public 
and publicly guaranteed debt increased to 
60.2 percent of GDP as the government ramped up borrowing to finance the soar-
ing deficit and repay maturing obliga-
tions.  
 
 
Outlook  
 
The economic growth is expected to 
rebound to 3.6 percent in 2021. This sce-
nario assumes accelerated vaccinations 
by mid-2021, no further lockdowns, and increased external demand. In this sce-
nario of a gradual recovery, after a pro-
tracted recession in Q1 2021, a rebound 
is expected thereafter, as restored con-sumer and investor confidence pushes 
up personal consumption, private in-vestment, and exports. The fiscal deficit 
is planned at 4.9 percent but given the 
extended government support to firms and households in early 2021 of an ad-
ditional 1.4 percent of GDP, the actual 
deficit will likely be higher. Setting pub-lic finances back on a sustainable path 
will be needed over the medium term, 
as public and publicly guaranteed debt 
surpasses 64 percent of GDP in 2021. 
Targeting a primary balance over the medium term would be needed to stem further public debt growth and not 
crowd out productive spending. This is 
even more important in the eventuality that international financing costs rise. 
Boosting revenues through cutting back 
on exemptions and strengthening com-pliance are priorities along with a grad-
ual state withdrawal from the corporate 
sector. Bringing people back to the labor 
market, as well as education and gov-
ernance reforms could help boost poten-
tial growth. Poverty is projected to re-
sume its decline as growth gradually recovers in 2021.

70 MPO  Apr 21  Key conditions and 
challenges  
 
The well -diversified Polish economy is 
one of Europe ’s least affected economies 
by the COVID -19 pandemic. GDP de-
clined however by 2.7 percent in 2020, the 
first output contraction in over 20 years.  
Prudent macroeconomic policies, effective 
absorption of EU investment funds, a 
sound financial sector, and better access to 
long -term credit fed into inclusive growth 
and poverty reduction. Real wage growth 
and a range of demographically targeted social programs (“Family 500+”, “13 th 
pension”) fed into robust consumption 
growth until early 2020. With an improv-ing business environment, Poland inte-grated well into regional value chains 
(RVCs). Higher levels of private invest-
ment, an improved innovation ecosystem, and further upgrading of RVCs are need-
ed to boost productivity and growth.  
A key challenge over the short term is to 
continue supporting the sectors most 
affected by the pandemic, while ensuring 
public debt sustainability. The unprece-
dented policy response to the COVID cri-sis has narrowed available fiscal space.  
Increased spending efficiency is needed to 
rebuild fiscal buffers for future countercy-
clical policies and to prepare for the grow-
ing fiscal burden arising from aging.  
The full economic and social impact of 
COVID -19 hinges on the success of con-
tainment efforts, the vaccination rollout 
and of the policy measures. The second wave of the pandemic weakened the recov-
ery, forcing a lockdown in multiple sectors, 
in particular retail, accommodations and 
services, and further straining the healthcare system. The risk of delays in the vaccination 
rollout and subsequent pandemic waves could undermine the recovery, with implica-
tions for jobs and inclusion.   
Over the medium term, a key challenge to 
sustained growth is a tightening labor sup-
ply made more acute by the aging popula-
tion. Achieving decarbonization commit-ments is another challenge. Strengthening 
institutions at both the national and subna-
tional level are necessary ingredients for 
sustained and inclusive growth and for the 
narrowing of regional disparities.  
   
Recent developments  
 
The economy recorded its first contraction 
since 1991 amid the pandemic, with out-put contracting 2.7 percent in 2020. The 
government swiftly implemented excep-
tional stimulus and accommodative mon-etary policy to mitigate the health , social 
impact and prevent economic scarring.  
The pandemic, heightened uncertainty, and 
negative confidence effects dampened pri-
vate consumption ( -3.1 percent) and total 
investment, ( -8.4 percent). Government 
spending to cushion pandemic impacts and a higher public wage bill contributed to the 
3.2 percent increase in public consumption, while  public investment remained stable.  
Disruptions to international trade and transport and lower demand from key EU partners caused a 0.5 percent decline in POLAND

Source: World Bank.  The two COVID -19 waves and contain-
ment measures have pushed the Polish 
economy into recession; however, Poland 
remained among the most resilient econo-
mies in the region. To mitigate the impact 
on firms and employment, economic 
measures were introduced that have nar-rowed the fiscal space. While unemploy-
ment impacts have been stymied, work 
stoppages have resulted in considerable 
household income impacts. The key chal-
lenges over the short term are swiftly roll-
ing out vaccinations and ensuring a ro-bust economic recovery.

71 MPO  Apr 21  exports. Lower domestic expenditure 
caused imports to decline 2.6 percent, 
with net exports contributing 1 percentage 
point to growth in 2020.   
Although disruptions to RVCs and lock-
down measures affected industrial activity ( -
9.4 percent in Q2), the Q3 rebound in do-
mestic activity and exports limited the de-
cline to 1.0 percent in 2020. Accommodation and catering collapsed by 45.5 percent, rais-
ing the risk of economic scarring. Most sec-
tors contracted at a moderate pace, while real estate activities and ICT expanded.    
Household income and employment im-pacts of the pandemic were mitigated 
through multiple additional support 
measures as well as by demographically targeted transfers that acted as an income base for population segments. Rapid assess-
ments show that household income declines 
were more widespread and pronounced in t h e  fi r s t  p a n d e m i c  w av e .  W o r k  s t o p p a g e s  
have however had a more pronounced im-
pact on lower -wage workers and those in 
non-standard contract types, who are also 
less likely to be covered by protective leave policies.  
The current account surplus rose to 3.5 per-
cent of GDP, as imports dropped by USD 
11.6 billion, while primary income outflows 
declined by USD 6.6 billion.  
The stimulus packages appear to have been 
effective in preventing a sharper increase in unemployment and earnings losses by sub-
sidizing salaries and supporting domestic 
enterprises via non -returnable transfers, 
loans, tax reliefs and deferrals among others. The unemployment rate increase was con-
tained to 1 pp. year -on-year by January 2021, 
rising to 6.5 percent.  
The large fiscal stimulus and the decline in economic activity caused the fiscal deficit to widen to an estimated 8.5 percent of GDP in 
2020.  
Inflation reached 3.4 percent in 2020, primar-
ily on account of lower international fuel 
prices and food prices. Meanwhile, higher electricity tariffs and a record low reference 
interest rate prevented a sharper decline in 
inflation.  
The financial sector's asset quality and capi-tal adequacy remain at satisfactory levels.  
  
Outlook 
 Trade recovery in the euro area, combined 
with improved confidence and a rebound 
in private consumption and investment is expected to support a moderate recovery 
of around 3.3 percent in 2021, bringing 
output above pre -crisis levels. The outlook 
incorporates the uncertainty arising from the new strains of the COVID -19 virus and 
the current pace of vaccination campaigns throughout Europe. Exceptional policy accommodation in Poland and in the EU 
more broadly is expected to continue 
throughout 2021, including near -zero poli-
cy interest rates. This baseline assumes 
that the pandemic is contained, with a vaccine effectively rolled out in 2021.  
The persistence of the crisis is expected to put a continued financial strain on poor working households that are more vulnera-
ble to reductions in hours worked and job 
loss. Therefore, the share of the population at risk of poverty is expected to remain ele-
vated through 2021 before gradually recov-
ering in 2022.  
Pent -up domestic demand, especially for 
capital and durable goods, and stronger demand for Poland ’s exports from key EU 
trading partners will support a recovery in 
the industrial sector and exports. Recovery 
in imports and increased primary income outflows are expected to contribute to a nar-
rowing in the current account surplus. Po-
land could receive nearly Euro 28 billion in grants and guarantees under the “Next Gen-
eration EU ” recovery package to fund its 
national recovery program, providing sup-port for a green and digital transition.  
The fiscal deficit is expected to narrow start-
ing in 2021, as the economy recovers and as 
support measures are targeted to the most 
affected sectors and vulnerable groups.

72 MPO  Apr 21  Key conditions and 
challenges  
 
Prior to the COVID -19 pandemic, Roma-
nia enjoyed a decade of economic growth; however, the COVID -19 crisis has affected 
economic activity and household incomes, 
exposing Romania ’s structural issues. Fis-
cal policy has historically been procyclical. 
The budget deficit averaged -2.8 percent 
of GDP between 2011-2019 as GDP growth averaged 3.9 percent over the 
same period. Economic growth was 
strong despite weak fundamentals. Elevat-ed private consumption, driven in part by unsustainable wage growth, has triggered 
inflationary pressures and placed the cur-
rent account deficit on a widening path. The quality and quantity of labor and cap-
ital, as well as slower productivity d y-
namics, have limited potential growth. 
Private investment has remained at fairly 
high levels, but a shallow financial sector 
limits the availability of long -term finance.  
The Government responded rapidly to the 
COVID -19 crisis by providing a fiscal 
stimulus of 4.4 percent of GDP in 2020. 
This is one of the lowest stimuli in the EU, reflecting the limited fiscal space. In the 
first COVID wave, poor and vulnerable households were less supported by the 
fiscal response measures, which extended 
more directly to those in formal employ-ment structures; subsequent programs for 
daily wage and seasonal workers extend-
ed protections to typically more vulnera-ble segments.  The key challenge in the short term is to 
contain the COVID -19 crisis and limit its 
health, economic and social consequences. 
The Government ’s policy response along-
side the European Union (EU) support, as 
well as a successful rollout of the COVID -
19 vaccine, will be critical in ensuring re-
covery. Bringing down the fiscal deficit 
alongside structural reforms to reduce inefficient expenditures and strengthen 
revenue mobilization will be paramount 
for the consolidation of public finance and for averting a sharp increase in public 
debt over the medium term. Additional 
challenges stem from Romania ’s histori-
cally low EU fund absorption rates, rais-
ing questions on the country ’s capacity to 
take advantage of the new recovery funds.  
 
 
Recent developments  
 
The Romanian economy contracted by                   
3.9 percent in 2020 on the back of better than expected fourth -quarter performance 
at -1.4 percent yoy. This reflects in part a 
smaller disruption of employment and production in the second wave of the pan-
demic in Q4 2020 compared to the first.  
Trade and services decreased by 4.7 per-cent in 2020, and high -frequency indica-
tors point to a quicker recovery contrib-
uting to the fourth quarter GDP rebound, 
although certain sectors – such as tourism 
and hospitality – remained heavily affect-
ed. Industry contracted by 9.3 percent, over the same period, reflecting the weak-
ening of external demand from Europe alongside pandemic -related restrictions ROMANIA

than anticipated, contracting by 3.9 per-
cent in 2020. A proactive but constrained 
fiscal response, at 4.4 percent of GDP, 
supported firms to retain employees and 
fed into household incomes. Economic 
growth is expected to rebound to 4.3 per-cent in 2021, supported by a pick -up in 
economic activity in the second half of the year. Poverty is anticipated to increase in 
the short term as the protracted impacts of 
COVID -19 affect domestic income 
sources and remittances.

73 MPO  Apr 21  and supply chain disruptions. The biggest 
contraction was seen in agriculture, linked 
to persistent droughts affecting crops. The 
output contractions led to deteriorating labor market conditions and increased 
unemployment affecting household in-come. The unemployment rate reached as 
high as 5.5 percent in July 2020 before 
edging down to 5.3 percent in December 2020.  
Rapid household assessments of COVID -
19 impacts showed a substantial rise in the share of the population at risk of poverty 
in April 2020, which gradually declined 
between July 2020 and January 2021 as 
temporarily inactive workers returned to 
work. Poverty levels at the start of 2021, however, remain elevated – linked to the 
combination of the sharp agricultural con-
traction and the persistence of the pan-
demic. Lower -earning workers and those 
on non -standard contracts continue to be 
more affected by employment stoppages during the second pandemic wave and approximately 20 percent of households 
reported lower incomes in January 2021 
than prior to the pandemic, with impacts felt across income groups.  
The fiscal deficit surged to 9.8 percent of 
projected GDP at the end of 2020 on the 
back of COVID -19 related expenditures 
and lower revenues due to the economic downturn and tax relief. Tax facilities, investments, and exceptional expendi-
tures allocated to combat the effects of the 
COVID -19 pandemic totaled 46.3 billion 
Ron (4.4 percent of GDP). This included 4.2 billion Ron for benefits granted during 
the period of temporary suspension of individual employment contracts, 2.7 bil-
lion Ron in VAT refunds supporting firm 
liquidity, and 0.9 billion Ron in bonuses granted for the payment at maturity of the 
tax on the income of micro -enterprises 
and the corporate income tax.  
To reduce the effects of the COVID -19 
crisis, the National Bank of Romania 
(NBR) has pursued a quantitative easing 
policy which included the purchase of 
government bonds from the secondary market, repo operations to provide liquid-ity to credit institutions and monetary 
policy rate cuts amounting to 1.25 percent-age points from 2.5 percent in February 2020 to 1.25 percent in January 2021.  
  
Outlook  
 
The economy is projected to grow at 
around 4.3 percent in 2021 on the back of 
strengthened economic activity in the sec-
ond half of 2021. The strength of the re-covery will depend on the success of the 
vaccine rollout and the policy response to the health crisis, as well as on develop-
ments in the EU. The impact of the stimu-
lus pursued at the EU level will play a 
critical role in the recovery given limited fiscal space. The NBR will continue its 
quantitative easing policy, further sup-porting the recovery. However, as growth 
recovers, inflationary and current account 
deficit pressures are expected to reemerge, requiring an appropriate policy response.  
A substantial reduction of the fiscal deficit in 2021 is improbable, as the government will have to support the economic recov-
ery process. Over the medium term, the 
deficit will follow a downward trajectory 
but is likely to remain above 3 percent 
throughout the projection period. The widening fiscal deficit would push public debt to 62.2 percent in 2023, from 37.3 
percent in 2019. However, public debt 
remains one of the lowest in the EU.  
Poverty is projected to remain elevated 
due to the triple -hit in incomes facing 
poorer segments of the population, in the 
form of the persistent pandemic, the poor 
agricultural year, and declining remittance 
incomes.

74 MPO  Apr 21  Key conditions and 
challenges  
 
In recent years, Russia undertook signifi-
cant macro -fiscal stabilization efforts, re-
sulting in an improved fiscal position —
including a sizeable accumulation of fiscal and reserve buffers —reduced exposure to 
oil price volatility and a lower public debt 
burden. A massive banking sector clean-
up, together with enhanced regulation 
and supervision, fortified capital and li-
quidity buffers. These efforts strengthened 
Russia’s ability to respond to the pan-
demic’s adverse economic shocks. They 
allowed the government to provide a sub-
stantial countercyclical fiscal stimulus 
(about 4.5 percent of GDP) and an accom-modative monetary policy (the key rate 
was lowered by 200 basis points between 
February –July 2020).  
Russia’s potential growth has been trend-
ing downward since the global financial crisis. While near -term recovery will be 
contingent on the stemming of the pan-
demic, longer -term economic prospects 
will depend on boosting potential growth 
through promoting economic diversifica-tion, reducing the state ’s economic foot-
print, leveling the playing field for the pri-
vate sector, improving governance —
particularly of state -owned enterprises —
and taking advantage of shifting global value chains. A green transition could pose 
significant challenges for the Russian econ-
omy un less the government undertakes 
preemptive steps toward decarbonization.  The downward trajectory in poverty rates 
since 2010 was interrupted by the shocks 
of 2014 –15. Since then, poverty has again 
declined, reaching 12.3 percent in 2019 (using the national measure). The official 
poverty rate jumped to 13.3 percent in the third quarter of 2020, reflecting the coro-
navirus pandemic ’s impact. Emergency 
social protection measures prevented an 
even greater increase in the poverty rate.  
  
Recent developments  
 
GDP contracted sharply in the second 
quarter of 2020, declining by 10.9 percent quarter on quarter, saar. Economic activity only partly recovered in the third quarter 
(rising by 2.8 percent quarter on quarter, 
saar) as mobility restrictions eased follow-ing a decline in COVID -19 cases and 
households and companies benefited from government support, including countercy-clical fiscal, monetary, macroprudential, 
and regulatory measures. Momentum 
slowed again in the fourth quarter as the pandemic ’s second wave swept across 
Russia and the globe. Pandemic mitiga-
tion measures heavily impacted the ser-
vices sectors, with the transportation and 
hotels and catering sectors registering 
double -digit contractions. The 2020 exten-
sion of the OPEC+ agreement weighed on 
mineral resource extraction, which con-
tributed -1 percentage point to GDP 
growth. Lower energy export receipts, 
financial market volatility, and increased 
geopolitical risks fueled a sharp increase in capital outflows in 2020 ($47.8 billion,

75 MPO  Apr 21  up from $22.1 billion in 2019), driving a 
real effective exchange rate depreciation. 
The sharp contraction in imports due to 
the depreciation, a decline in real income, and impediments to outward tourism 
failed to fully offset the drop in energy exports.  
The general government fiscal deficit wid-ened to 4.0 percent of GDP in 2020 (compared to a surplus of 1.9 percent of 
GDP in 2019), driven by pandemic re-
sponse spending and the need for eco-nomic support measures amid lower ener-
gy revenues. Unemployment rose in all 
regions, but job losses were concentrated 
in manufacturing, real estate, and hotels 
and catering. The unemployment rate stood at 5.8 percent in January 2021, down from its peak of 6.4 percent in August but 
still above the 4.6 percent rate recorded in 
December 2019.  
Weakening asset quality across the corpo-
rate, small and medium enterprise, and 
retail segments put pressure on bank profitability and amplified macro -
financial risks. The extent of problem loans on bank balance sheets will only become clearer in mid -2021 when the au-
thorities lift the remaining regulatory for-
bearance measures.  
Since the end of 2020, 12 -month consumer 
price inflation has exceeded the central bank’s target of 4 percent, owing mainly to higher global food prices and ruble 
deprecation.  In February 2021, inflation 
reached 5.7 percent. Elevated inflationary 
pressure coupled with domestic demand rebound prompted the Central Bank of 
Russia (CBR) to raise its key interest rate by 25 bp to 4.5 percent in March.  
 
Outlook  
 
Assuming that no third wave of corona-
virus infections occurs in Russia, consum-
er and business confidence are expected to 
improve, paving the way for a gradual 
economic rebound. GDP growth is fore-cast at 2.9 percent in 2021 and 3.2 percent in 2022. The general government deficit is 
expected to improve, narrowing to about 
2.0 percent of GDP in 2021 and turning into 0.5 percent of GDP surplus in 2022. 
Deficit financing, mainly through domes-
tic debt issuance, will increase general government debt to a still -manageable 20 
percent of GDP in 2023 (from 14 percent in 2019). Following 2020’s stronger fiscal 
impulse, the 2021 –22 fiscal consolidation 
in Russia will be deeper than in other 
emerging markets and will become a drag 
on growth. Given its relatively low public 
debt, sizeable macro -fiscal buffers, and 
expected persisting negative output gap, Russia has the fiscal space for a more gradual consolidation, allowing further 
increases in social spending and support 
to regions. In line with the OPEC+ agree-ment, oil production restrictions will fall 
away in 2021- –22, supporting growth of 
oil output and export volumes. Twelve -
month consumer price inflation is project-ed to average 4.3 percent in 2021 before stabilizing around the central bank ’s tar-
get of 4 percent in 2022 –23. 
In 2021, the poverty rate (using the upper -
middle -income poverty line of US$5.5 per 
day) is expected to decline to below 2020 levels as the economy rebounds. Howev-
er, it will remain above pre -pandemic 
levels until 2022.  
The outlook faces substantial downside risks. Lower -than -expected vaccine effec-
tiveness or vaccine hesitancy could delay the economic recovery, as could new sanc-tions. Banks could face deteriorating asset 
quality, profitability, and capitalization, 
including from the country ’s overheated 
mortgage market. The CBR extended the 
forbearance on impairment recognition 
until mid -2021. Although these measures 
should allow banks to accumulate profits 
to increase loan loss provisioning, they 
will also delay the realization of unavoid-
able and costly losses.

76 MPO  Apr 21  Key conditions and 
challenges  
 
The focus of the Government of Serbia in 
recent years has been on macroeconomic 
stability, in light of deficits of over 6 per-cent of GDP (2012-14) and high and in-
creasing public debt. A substantial fiscal 
consolidation effort started in 2014 to low-er total expenditures from 45.2 percent of 
GDP in 2014 to 42.3 percent in 2019, and 
to increase revenues from around 38 per-
cent of GDP to 42.1 in 2019. As a result, 
the large deficits were turned into a sur-plus in 2017 and a balanced budget there-after. Tighter fiscal policy together with 
natural disasters, including a drought in 
2012 and major floods in 2014, resulted in lower growth, which averaged 1.9 percent 
over 2010 -19 period. The rate of economic 
growth started to improve just before the 
COVID -19 pandemic, averaging 4.4 per-
cent in 2018 and 2019. Growth was pri-marily led by consumption, and invest-ment remained low as a share of GDP at 
around 19 percent over 2010 -19 period.  
The Serbian economy went through the 
first year of the pandemic with a minimal recession since the government used most 
of the available fiscal space and buffers at the start of the pandemic. The impact of 
the program on the economy and living 
standards was favorable but came at a considerable fiscal cost. With limited 
space for future stimulus packages, fur-
ther reforms are needed to bring the econ-omy bac k to sustained gro wth and to  secure jobs and incomes while strengthen-
ing resilience to shocks.  
Over the medium term the Serbian econo-
my is expected to return to the pre -
COVID -19 growth pattern. However, 
some challenges that limit growth both 
over the short and over the medium to 
long term will remain. Most importantly, 
Serbia needs to continue efforts to remove bottlenecks for private sector growth 
stemming from the deteriorating govern-
ance environment, insufficiently devel-oped infrastructure and unreformed edu-
cation sector which creates increasing con-
cern about skills mismatch.  
 
 
Recent developments  
 After a robust growth of 4.2 percent in 2019, the COVID -19 pandemic caused a 
recession of -1 percent in 2020. This is a 
significantly better result than what was previously projected (a drop of 3 percent). 
Services sectors were hit most by the pan-
demic-related events (down 1.5 percent, y/y) while value added in industry re-
mained flat in real terms, and the agricul-
ture sector grew by 4.9 percent. On the 
expenditure side, both investment and consumption had a negative contribution 
to growth in 2020 ( -1.1 and -0.7pp, respec-
tively) while net exports had a positive 
contribution to growth (0.8pp).  
The large fiscal stimulus program, of 
close to 13 percent of GDP, helped to 
keep the recession mild. It comprised tax 
deferrals and increased expenditures of around 8 percent of GDP and guarantees SERBIA

Source: World Bank.  Source: World Bank. Notes: see Table 2.  The Serbian economy entered only a mild 
recession of -1 percent in 2020 thanks to 
the significant fiscal stimulus program of around 13 percent of GDP. As a result, 
there was not a substantial increase in 
poverty, which is estimated to be close to 
its 2019 level. Downside risks remain, primarily because of uncertainties related 
to the external environment. To promote 
economic growth this year the govern-
ment announced a new fiscal stimulus program worth around 5 percent of GDP.

77 MPO  Apr 21  in the  amount of 4.8 percent of GDP. As 
the largest part of the package (7.4 percent 
of GDP) went to businesses, it helped to 
avoid a major reduction in employment. 
In fact, registered employment increased 
by 1.9 percent compared to 2019. The Q3 unemployment rate, as measured by the 
Labor Force Survey, stood at 9 percent in 
2020, slightly lower than 2019. The wage subsidy and cash support to citizens also 
helped to avert a spike in poverty, alt-
hough at a significant fiscal cost. Due to the support package, limited labor market 
impacts, and growth in agriculture, pov-
erty (income under $5.5/day in revised 
2011 PPP) is estimated to have remained 
stagnant from 17.3 percent in 2019 to 17.4 percent in 2020.  
The fiscal deficit increased significantly in 
2020 and reached an estimated 8.1 percent 
of GDP. This increase is primarily the re-sult of the large fiscal stimulus program. 
Public debt is estimated at 58.2 percent of 
GDP by end -2020.  
Inflation by year -end reached 1.3 percent y/
y, however food prices increased by 2.1 percent. The dinar has remained broadly stable against the euro, supported by sig-
nificant interventions by the NBS on the 
foreign exchange market (NBS sold re-
serves worth 1.5 billion euros in 2020). The banking sector ’s performance remains ro-
bust despite two rounds of debt morat oria introduced in 2020 as part of the COVID -
19 response measures. NPLs stood at 3.5 
percent as of November. On the external 
side, CAD decreased significantly – from 
6.9 percent of GDP in 2019 to 4.3 percent 
in 2020.  
 
 
Outlook  
 
Recovery from the COVID -19 related re-
cession is expected to start in 2021. 
Growth will be supported by a recently 
announced new package of measures to 
support citizens and the economy worth 
5.1 percent of GDP. As a result, the econo-my is expected to rebound by 5 percent in 2021. Over the medium term, growth is 
expected to be around 4 percent. Growth 
will be driven by consumption and invest-ment will recover only slowly, which may 
slow down the impact of growth on labor 
markets (both employment and wages). This medium -term outlook crucially de-
pends on international developments (including the control of COVID -19), the 
pace of structural reforms and political 
developments.  
Immediate focus is needed on measures to 
improve the business environment and governance in order to lower the cost of 
doing business and ensure security and safety, as well as efforts to improve the 
quality of infrastructure. Regarding the 
medium - to long -term challenges the fo-
cus should be on demography and climate change. First, an aging and shrinking pop-
ulation will leave Serbia with a smaller available labor force. Labor shortages 
combined with skills mismatches could 
significantly hurt the competitiveness of the Serbian economy. Second, the impact 
of climate change – including more fre-
quent and severe droughts and floods – 
will hit agriculture and food production hard and will make the cost of infrastruc-
ture maintenance much higher.  
The pace of labor market recovery will be 
critical for resumed poverty reduction.  
The new package is expected to support citizens and economic recovery, though 
poor and vulnerable households, who 
tend to depend more on self -employment 
and less secure jobs, may take longer to 
regain their income level. Poverty is pro-
jected to slowly decline to 16.8 percent in 2021.  
In the medium term, regional disputes and slow progress with the EU accession process could affect investment sentiment 
and therefore delay investment projects in 
infrastructure and other sectors.  Labor 
market challenges limit the scope for ro-bust welfare improvements and could be 
exacerbated by a significant brain -drain.

78 MPO  Apr 21  Key conditions and 
challenges  
 
Since the 1997 Peace Accord, the Tajik 
economy has grown steadily, averaging 
7.6 percent annually between 1998 –20. 
GNI per capita rose six -fold, to $1,030 by 
2019, and poverty fell to 26.3 percent from over 80 percent in the early 2000s. Tajiki-stan’s strong performance reflects a favor-
able external environment (which drove migrant remittances), generous official 
donor assistance, and the launch of struc-
tural reforms. However, despite high an-nual growth rates, job creation rates have fallen short. Tajikistan remains highly 
dependent on migrant remittances and 
commodity exports to generate foreign exchange. As external financing declines, 
Tajikistan ’s other main driver of growth —
public investment —also faces greater 
challenges.  
The 2016 taxpayer bailout of domestic 
banks and commercial borrowing in 2017 for a large infrastructure project squeezed 
the fiscal space and pushed up the public 
debt to a level that presents a high risk of 
debt distress. In the context of large tax expenditures and inefficient state -owned 
enterprises ambiguous tax revenue mobi-
lization efforts led to a deterioration of the 
competition required for robust private 
sector development.  
With the credit to GDP ratio at 15.8 percent, 
Tajikistan ’s financial sector remains shal-
low, lacks effective intermediation, and 
faces difficulties gaining the public ’s trust.  Tajikistan is making progress in improv-
ing its business climate. The country was 
among the top 10 reformers in Doing 
Business 2020 while still ranking 106 out of 190 economies worldwide. The protec-
tion of property rights, the rule of law, and corruption remain significant chal-
lenges to businesses operating in Tajiki-
stan.  
Poverty is largely a rural phenomenon in 
Tajikistan. Roughly 30 percent of the rural 
population lives in poverty compared to just 18 percent of the urban population. 
Labor earnings and remittances from 
abroad have been the two critical factors 
for poverty reduction in Tajikistan. In 
2020, the loss of employment and reduced incomes, especially from remittances, ex-erted additional stress on poor house-
holds.  
 
 
Recent developments  
 
The impact of COVID -19 slowed real GDP 
growth to 4.5 percent in 2020 (from 7.5 
percent in 2019). Precious metals exports 
supported growth in 2020. In contrast, 
domestic demand suffered from declining 
private consumption and investment as remittance inflows fell by 6.3 percent year 
on year. On the supply side, the pandemic mainly affected activities in the hospitality 
and construction sectors.  
The current account recorded a surplus of 
7.6 percent of GDP in the first nine months 
of 2020 as Tajikistan benefited from surg-
ing gold prices. Exports of precious metals rose threefold to $690 million. In contrast, TAJIKISTAN

Sources: TajStat; World Bank staff estimates.  Source: World Bank. Notes: see Table 2.  COVID-19 suppressed aggregate supply 
and demand in 2020, slowing real GDP 
growth to 4.5 percent. Precious metal 
exports drove growth while remittance 
declined, unemployment rose, and house-
holds reduced food consumption. Poverty 
reduction paused for the first time in two 
decades, underscoring the pandemic's severity. The economy is projected to re-
bound in 2021–22, subject to a sustained 
vaccine rollout, improved global trade conditions, and opportunities for migrant 
workers to travel abroad. Poverty reduc-
tion is expected to resume in 2021. How-
ever, downside risks prevail.

earning losses and a 7.7 percent currency 
depreciation dampened consumer goods 
imports. Preliminary data show a signifi-cant drop in precious metals exports in the 
fourth quarter of 2020, which likely re-balanced the current account for the full 
year. Foreign exchange reserves rose to 8.5 
months of import cover at end -2020.  
The authorities swiftly responded to the 
pandemic by allowing tax deferrals for 
companies. They also ramped up healthcare spending by 44 percent and 
social expenditures by 10 percent. As a 
result, the 2020 fiscal deficit widened to 
3.3 percent of GDP. The outcome was low-
er than earlier projections, allowing the authorities to save some of the financial support from international financial insti-
tutions. Tajikistan also benefited from the 
Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), which suspended 2020 debt servicing 
equivalent to $43.5 million, creating fiscal 
space to respond to the pandemic.  
The central bank supported domestic de-
mand by cutting the policy rate by 200 bps 
in 2020, to 10.75 percent. Supply chain disruptions, higher food prices, and cur-
rency depreciation pass -through hiked 
yearly inflation to 9.4 percent. The finan-
cial sector was resilient amidst the pan-demic. The nonperforming loan ratio fell 
to 23.8 percent in 2020 (from 27 percent in 2019).  The crisis increased food insecurity in 
Tajikistan. In May 2020, 42 percent of 
households reported reducing their food 
consumption. Estimates suggest that pov-erty has remained little changed from 26.3 
percent in 2019, marking the first time that poverty reduction paused in two decades.  
In July 2020, the government expanded the Targeted Social Assistance program from 40 districts to all 68 of the country ’s 
districts, increasing the number of benefi-
ciaries from 1.3 million to 1.8 million people.   
 
Outlook  
 
Tajikistan ’s economy is forecast to re-
bound in 2021 –22, assuming a vaccination 
rollout to 20 percent in 2021 and 50 per-
cent by the end of 2022 for low - and mid-
dle-income countries. Real GDP growth is projected at 5 percent in 2021, subject to improved global trade and opportunities 
for migrants to return to the Russian Fed-
eration. Remittances and foreign invest-ment are projected to rise, reflecting a 
better growth outlook in Russia and Chi-
na. Rising fuel and food prices could stoke 
inflation.  
The country ’s external deficit is expected 
to deteriorate as higher remittances spur imports and export growth moderates, especially for precious metals.  
The approved state budget for 2021 re-
flects the authorities ’ ambitious plans for 
fiscal consolidation. Our projections indi-
cate a fiscal deficit of 2.6 percent of GDP supported by a moderate rebound in eco-
nomic activity and a corresponding tax 
collection increase. The government is expected to use concessional external bor-
rowing to close the financing gap.  
The authorities are reforming the power 
utility company, Barqi Tojik, by unbun-
dling it into three independent companies 
responsible for power generation, trans-
mission, and distribution. Ongoing tax 
system reforms and the adoption of a new tax code are expected to improve the busi-ness climate over the medium term.  
A resumption of the downward trend in the poverty rate is expected in 2021. How-ever, downside risks prevail. A delayed 
vaccination rollout or renewed failure to 
contain the spread of COVID -19 could 
impede economic recovery. Meanwhile, a 
continuation of travel restrictions could 
suppress international trade and a recov-ery of remittances. Reduced household 
income may further exacerbate food inse-
curity and household well -being.

80 MPO  Apr 21  Key conditions and 
challenges  
 
Turkey’s economy has rebounded strong - 
ly from the pandemic -related slowdown 
of 2020. However, this rapid recovery has raised macroeconomic and financial sta - 
bility risks. Unless addressed, these vul-nerabilities will expose Turkey to height-ened risk and continue to limit productivi-
ty, which has stagnated in recent years. 
Recent market turmoil following the re-
placement of the Central Bank Governor 
illustrates the importance of a sustained and credible focus on bringing inflation down to the target rate of 5 percent and 
bolstering the country ’s international re-
serves. Structural reforms in labor, prod-
uct, and financial markets, and to innova-
tion systems can support productivity 
growth. Corporate sector vulnerabilities —
further elevated by the pandemic and 
higher debt burden — present risks to 
banks. Developing local - currency, long -
term finance sources would alleviate exist-ing imbalances in the financial system and 
contribute to economic growth.  
The economic recovery in the second half of 2020 helped recover most of the jobs 
lost during the pandemic ’s first wave. 
However, jobs for informal, lower -skilled, 
female, and young workers remain well below their pre -pandemic levels. Further-
more, 2.6 million more individuals were 
out of the labor force in 2020. The poverty 
rate is projected to increase to 12.2 percent in 2020, which would mark the second successive year that poverty has increased 
in Turkey, from 8.5 percent in 2018.  
 
 
Recent developments  
 Real GDP grew by 5.9 percent year on year 
in the fourth quarter of 2020, completing a remarkable rebound in the second half and 
resulting in full -year growth of 1.8 percent 
despite the economic fallout from the coro-
navirus pandemic. The recovery was driv-
en by surging domestic demand, buoyed 
by credit in the second and third quarter. 
The authorities loosened monetary policy 
and delivered a stimulus program totaling 13 percent of GDP, most of which was sup-port via the banking sector in the form of 
partial credit guarantees and loan deferrals. 
Other fiscal support included social sup-port payments to households, support for 
furloughed workers, tax deferrals, and 
other support for firms.  
Growth from these policies came at the 
cost of rising prices and macro -financial 
vulnerabilities. Inflation trended upward, 
reaching 15.6 percent in February —the 
highest level in 18 months. The Turkish 
lira depreciated by 20 percent against the 
U.S. dollar in 2020. From a surplus in 
2019, the current account moved back 
into deficit ($36.7 billion or 5.1 percent of GDP) as tourism income evaporated, 
merchandise exports fell, and gold im-
ports increased. After the central bank stepped in to finance as much as 80 per-

from China to record an economic expan-
sion in 2020. Real GDP growth of 1.8 
percent was driven by an extensive stimu-
lus and effective control of the COVID -19 
pandemic. Turkey ’s economy is expected 
to grow by 5 percent in 2021 but reduc-
ing inflation and rebuilding external buff-
ers—both of which suffered setbacks in 
2020—will prove challenging. Poverty is 
projected to increase further following increases in 2019 and 2020, with informal 
workers and households outside the social security system being hit hardest.

percent. Buoyant tax revenues resulted in 
a central government deficit of 3.4 percent 
of GDP in 2020, better than the planned 
deficit of 4.9 percent of GDP.  
Toward the end of 2020, a second wave of 
COVID -19 peaked, with cases reaching 
30,000 a day in November. Following the reimposition of containment measures (including masking, weekend curfews, 
and restaurant closures), new cases de-
clined to around 10,000 a day by February 2021, following which, the government 
began easing restrictions again, based on a 
province -level risk assessment.  
By late 2020, the authorities had also 
moved to address economic vulnerabili-ties, more than doubling interest rates between August and December, repealing 
exceptional regulations aimed at stimulat-
ing credit growth, and increasing trans-parency. This policy shift helped spur 
portfolio inflows, stabilize the lira, and 
strengthen market confidence. Credit growth decelerated sharply to near zero 
(13-week average) by February, and the 
banking sector reduced its net open for-
eign exchange position.  
 
 
Outlook 
 The economy is expected to grow by 5.0 
percent in 2021 and 4.5 percent in 2022 and 2023. Despite slow quarterly growth expected in 2021 —as monetary policy 
remains tight and external demand 
weak —GDP in the second quarter will be 
higher than the year -earlier period when 
COVID -19 brought Turkey ’s economy to a 
near -standstill. These projections assume 
that cautious reopening continues and 
that there is no uncontrolled outbreak in Turkey or its major export markets, which 
could undermine growth. 
Recent sharp depreciation of the Lira in response to the replacement of the Central 
Bank Governor will impact inflation. Av-
erage inflation is projected to increase in 
2021 to 15.5 percent. The current account 
deficit is expected to narrow to 3.7 percent of GDP in 2021. The 2021 general govern-ment deficit is projected at 3.5 percent of 
GDP as the need for additional support to 
cushion the economic and social impact of the pandemic continues, before narrowing 
to 3.1 percent in 2022 and 2.6 percent in 
2023 as temporary tax reductions and oth-er government support is withdrawn.  
Regulatory forbearance (especially on nonperforming loan definitions and capi-tal adequacy ratio calculations) is ex-
pected to be phased out in mid -2021, after 
which there may be an increase in nonper-
forming and distressed loans. Strengthen-ing bad loan resolution, insolvency, and 
out-of-court corporate debt restructuring 
frameworks with an effective corporate 
viability assessment will be critical to shield corporates and the banks from spillovers.  
Turkey’s external risk profile is high due 
to its still -low level of international re-
serves and sizeable external financing 
needs. The country has limited space to manage exchange rate volatility in the 
event of new external shocks. The banking 
sector has adequate foreign exchange buffers, most of which form part of central 
bank international reserves.  
Simulation analysis suggests that poverty 
may have increased by as much as 2.1 
percentage points in 2020 —equivalent to 
1.6 million new poor. The crisis pushed a 
similar number of people into poverty as 
the 2018/19 recession. Had the govern-
ment not acted swiftly to stem the social effects of COVID -19 the increase in pov-
erty would have been three times greater. Turkey is projected to enter 2021 with the highest poverty rate since 2012. Successful 
poverty reduction will require ensuring 
that the recovery benefits informal and unskilled workers and other vulnerable 
groups through a policy mix of social 
transfers, inclusive job creation, and labor activation strategies.

82 MPO  Apr 21  Key conditions and 
challenges  
 
Even prior to the COVID -19 outbreak, 
Ukraine faced structurally weak growth due to low levels of domestic savings and fixed investment. Until 2020, savings repre-
sented up to 5 percent of GDP and gross 
capital formation was above 10 percent over the last five years. While the pandemic 
and associated recession has temporarily 
reversed this trend, savings estimated at 
11.3 percent of GDP in 2020 and investment 
at around 7 percent are well below compar-ator countries with similar development and infrastructure needs.   Reforms that 
address structural weaknesses in the finan-
cial sector; reduce market distortions, in-cluding due to still dominant role of SOEs 
in select sectors; and address macroeco-
nomic vulnerabilities are paramount to increase investment. In addition, while 
household incomes have grown rapidly in 
recent years, this has increasingly been driven by transfers rather than labor in-
comes, a pattern that is unsustainable for 
effective poverty reduction.  
The COVID -19 outbreak redirected gov-
ernment policy from structural reforms 
towards ad -hoc reactive measures. As a 
result, macro -fiscal risks have increased. 
Public sector financial needs are expected to grow due to increases in minimum wages and social transfers, limiting space 
for public investment, and fueling infla-
tionary pressures in a supply -constrained 
economy. Additionally, large government domestic borrowings are crowding out 
much needed private investment. Hold-
ings of government securities already rep-
resent close to 30 percent of total assets of the state -owned banks while corporate 
lending continues to stagnate. Stronger 
fiscal discipline is needed to reduce risks 
for medium -term growth prospects.  
 
 
Recent developments  
 
Although the economic impact from the 
COVID -19 outbreak appears to be less se-
vere than initially anticipated – GDP de-
clined by estimated 4.5 percent in 2020 (vs  6.5 percent decline 1H2020) –  the pandemic 
has exacted a heavy toll in terms of health 
and mortality impacts; and undermined the 
government ’s commitment to undertake 
critical reforms. Recent anti -corruption re-
forms have also suffered setbacks due to adverse court rulings in late 2020.    Economic activity recovered in H2 2020 
supported by a number of measures to 
mitigate the impact of COVID -19. Moreo-
ver, the full -scale lockdown has been re-
placed by an adaptive quarantine in June 
2020 that enabled many services to return 
to normal functioning. Domestic demand 
was boosted by over 10 percent YoY real 
wage growth due to increase in minimum wages and gradual recovery in economic 
activity.  Thus, on the supply side, retail 
and wholesale trade grew 7.9 percent YoY in 2020 and made a significant positive 
contribution to GDP growth. The financial 
sector has weathered the downturn with its capital adequacy still strong. At the UKRAINE

cent, the economic impact of COVID -19 
has been smaller than in most other coun-tries, nevertheless the pandemic has 
caused a heavy toll on households and 
weakened the commitment by the govern-
ment to undertake critical reforms. Only a partial recovery in GDP growth of 3.8 
percent is expected in 2021, given high 
uncertainty regarding the rollout of the 
vaccine and the slow pace of structural 
reforms to address bottlenecks to invest-
ment and to safeguard macroeconomic sustainability.

83 MPO  Apr 21  same time, agriculture output fell almost 12 
percent due to drought and a poor harvest.  
On the external side, lower energy and 
higher iron and grain commodity prices resulted in the most favorable terms of 
trade for Ukraine for the last decade. Com-bined with import compression, this result-
ed in a CA surplus of 4.4 percent in 2020. 
Remittances were relatively resilient, down only 5.3 percent YoY in 2020, while private 
capital inflows also recovered in 2H2020. 
Thus, international reserves reached US$29.1bn at end -December, equal to 4.7 
months of next year ’s imports.  
Following the smaller -than -expected eco-
nomic decline, fiscal revenue also per-
formed better than anticipated. On the ex-penditure side, COVID -19 related outlays 
were less than budgeted, and a portion of 
the pandemic special fund was redirected 
to capital expenditures and to support a public sector wage and pension increase. 
The fiscal deficit amounted to 6.2 percent of 
GDP vs. the initial plan of 7.6 percent.  
After two years of tight monetary policy, 
the National Bank of Ukraine gradually 
cut its key policy rate to 6 percent in June 2020, a level it has since maintained How-
ever, a more accommodative fiscal policy 
stance resulted in an increase in inflation 
expectations from 6.7 percent in August to 8 percent at year -end. The inflation rate 
grew from 2.5 percent on average in  Q1-Q3 2020 to 6.1 percent in January 2021 
that is slightly above the NBU ’s target of 
5+/-1 percent. This triggered the key rate 
increase to 6.5 percent in March 2021.  
While the COVID -19 relief measures were 
welcome, attention once again needs to 
turn towards structural reforms that are 
needed to raise the medium -term growth 
prospects. Slower reform momentum has 
undermined investors’ confidence and 
delayed IFI financing; as a result, signifi-cant public financing needs in 2020 have been met mostly by domestic borrowing 
that amounted to 10.5 percent GDP (gross). 
The composition of external financing was 
shifted towards more expensive commer-
cial borrowings and Eurobonds comprising 4.3 percent of GDP in total.  
The poverty effects of COVID -19 are ex-
pected to be relatively muted, with the poverty rate based on US$5.5 a day pro-jected to have increased by 0.5 pp to 3 
percent in 2020, as increase of pensions 
and wages helped to partially offset de-cline in employment.   
 
Outlook  
 
Ukraine’s economic recovery in 2021 is 
expected to be mild given high uncertain-
ty associated with the vaccine rollout and the direction of economic policies to ad-
dress bottlenecks to investment and safe-
guard macroeconomic sustainability. The 
GDP growth projection of 3.8 percent is underpinned by positive base effects in 
agriculture and processing industry and takes into account that further temporary 
lockdowns are possible in the first half of 
2021 due to the delays in vaccinations.  
The 2021 budget targets a 5.4 percent defi-
cit. Together with 10.5 percent of GDP 
debt amortization and 1.3 percent of GDP of arrears to private sector, this will in-
crease total fiscal financing needs to 17.2 
percent of GDP (vs 15 percent of GDP in 
2020). The increase in minimum wages 
will push the public wage bill to over 11 percent of GDP and create additional pressures on current account imbalances 
and inflation. Prudent fiscal policy is 
needed to address inflationary pressures in the medium term.  
The poverty rate based on the US$5.5 a day threshold is expected to decrease to 2.5 percent in 2021, similar to the level in 
2019. Accelerating the reform momentum 
is key to achieve faster economic growth and poverty reduction in 2022 and 2023.

84 MPO  Apr 21  Key conditions and 
challenges  
 
After an initial phase of market liberaliza-
tion, Uzbekistan is moving into a more 
complex phase of reforms to land, labor, capital markets, and state -owned enter-
prises. The most significant medium -term 
challenge will be ensuring reform inclu-sivity and transparency. Reducing the 
state’s role in the economy by accelerating 
the reform of state -owned enterprises and 
creating a competitive and inclusive pri-
vate sector -led growth model will help 
address the legacy of the state -led model, 
which produced high growth rates (averaging more than 6 percent between 
2000 –16), but insufficient jobs and oppor-
tunities.  
The COVID -19 crisis made the transition 
to a market economy even more im-portant. About 9 percent of the population 
still lives below the World Bank ’s lower -
middle -income poverty line ($3.2 a day, 
PPP 2011 adjusted), and significantly more live close to this line. During the peak of 
the COVID -19 lockdowns, these vulnera-
bilities were acute —nearly 1 million addi-
tional Uzbeks slipped into poverty.  
To reduce these vulnerabilities, the au-
thorities’ strong focus on vibrant growth 
will need to be complemented by reforms to strengthen safety nets, improve labor market conditions, and remove con-
straints to human capital development 
through better health and education ser-vices. An important sign of reform success will be greater private sector participation 
and ownership in the economy and better 
quality jobs. Addressing these challenges 
with limited administrative capacity will be even more difficult as the pandemic ’s 
impact lingers.  
  
Recent developments  
 
GDP growth slowed sharply in 2020 (to 1.6 percent from 5.8 percent in 2019) due 
to COVID -19–related lockdowns and trad-
ing disruptions. Uzbekistan was one of 
the few countries in the region to record 
an economic expansion in 2020. Positive 
growth was supported by robust agricul-ture output and substantial anticrisis 
measures that boosted health spending 
and supported households and firms. Fis-cal stimulus and lower public investment 
due to the pandemic lifted consumption in 
2020, making it the main driver of growth for the first time in over a decade.  
The unemployment rate rose sharply, from 9 percent in 2019 to 11.1 percent in September 2020. The poverty rate rose to 9 
percent (well above the precrisis projec-
tion of 7.4 percent in 2020) as the pandem-
ic led to job losses, income reductions, and declining remittances. A large expansion 
of social assistance provided some relief to Uzbekistan ’s affected households.  
The current account deficit narrowed to 5.2 percent of GDP in 2020 (from 5.7 percent in 2019), reflecting an 18 percent surge in gold 
exports that helped limit the decline in total 
exports to 15 percent in 2020. Import spending fell by 17 percent as capital  UZBEKISTAN

cannot validate the official figures. Note: The national poverty line is based on a 
minimum food consumption norm of 2,100 calories per person per day. Both the 
national poverty line and welfare aggregate exclude nonfood items.  Following a sharp deceleration in 2020, 
Uzbekistan ’s economy is projected to par-
tially recover from the COVID -19 crisis 
in 2021. Until a full recovery occurs, vul-
nerable households will require continued 
support to mitigate the pandemic ’s im-
pact. The medium -term economic outlook 
remains favorable, as global conditions improve, and as authorities advance re-
forms to reduce the role of state -owned 
enterprises in the economy to strengthen 
private sector -led growth and production 
efficiency. Translating this outlook into faster poverty reduction will require a stronger focus on inclusive reforms that 
increase employment, incomes, and op-portunities.

borrowing helped finance the deficit.  
Lower revenues and higher spending 
widened the overall fiscal deficit to 4.4 percent of GDP in 2020 (from 3.9 percent 
in 2019). Slower GDP growth and tax re-lief measures in the government's fiscal 
stimulus package (2.5 percent of GDP) 
reduced revenues, while spending in-creases in the package drove up expendi-
tures. Higher gold dividends, the repriori-
tization of some public expenditure, and a sharp fall in policy lending largely offset 
the impact of the fiscal stimulus and con-
tained the deficit. Higher borrowing to 
finance the deficit increased public and 
publicly guaranteed debt to 37.9 percent of GDP in 2020. Foreign exchange reserves equivalent to 60 percent of GDP provide a 
substantial buffer.  
Smaller increases in administered prices 
because of the pandemic offset higher 
food prices to slow 12 -month inflation to 
11 percent in December 2020 (from 15.2 
percent a year earlier). With inflationary 
pressures low, the Central Bank of Uzbek-
istan reduced its policy rate from 16 pe r-
cent to 14 percent. Credit growth in 2020 
slowed to 34 percent (from 52 percent in 
2019), reflecting higher real lending rates, 
lower government -subsidized lending, 
and the impact of COVID -19. Firms and 
households also received significant loan repayment deferrals during the year. The banking sector ’s capital adequacy ratio fell 
to 18.4 percent in November 2020 (from 
23.5 percent at end -2019). As a result of 
the pandemic, nonperforming loans tri-
pled to 4.5 percent in November 2020. Nevertheless, Uzbekistan ’s financial sys-
tem remains sufficiently capitalized to absorb potential credit shocks.  
 
Outlook  
 
GDP growth is projected to recover to 4.8 
percent in 2021. However, this forecast is 
subject to uncertainty surrounding the 
global recovery and the potential pace of the country ’s COVID -19 vaccination cam-
paign. A gradual resumption of trade and investment flows, a bountiful agricultural harvest, a ecovery of remittances, and 
vaccine distribution will support the re-
covery and spur further reductions in poverty and unemployment. Stronger 
GDP growth of 5.5 percent is projected in 
2022 as vaccination efforts accelerate and global disruptions ease further. The cur-
rent account deficit is projected to widen 
to 5.5 percent of GDP in 2021 as capital 
imports for large investment projects recov-er. Although foreign direct investment is 
expected to partially recover from its  decline in 2020, public and private bo rrow-
ing are expected to continue financing 
most of the deficit. Lower budget reve-
nues, vaccine purchases, expanding social 
support, and increased policy lending are 
expected to contribute to a wider overall fiscal deficit of 5.4 percent of GDP in 2021. 
This deficit will be financed by increased 
public borrowing. Uzbekistan ’s public 
debt is projected to reach 42 percent of 
GDP in 2021 and stabilize at about 45 per-
cent over the medium term. As conditions for households and firms improve, a grad-
ual withdrawal of anticrisis measures will 
reduce the deficit over the medium term.

government expenditures are close to 40 percent of gross domestic product and the public sector accounts for over 25 percent of total employment, much higher than the global average of 16 percent. The public sector often attracts some of the best educated workers in the region. And support for a larger public sector is increasing due to aging populations and their growing health care and long-term care needs, rising inequality and greater support for redistribution, and increasing expenditures as governments address the challenges posed by the COVID-19 crisis. The significant role that government plays underscores the importance of the quality of governance in determining productivity and growth and effectively responding to the region’s economic and social challenges.
Digital technology and the data revolution offer the potential to increase efficiency, 
transparency, responsiveness, and citizen trust, directly impacting the quality of government. Across the world, the quality of government is increasingly informed by the extent to which governments harness digital tools and GovTech to optimize man-agement, service delivery, and overall state capacity. Technology and data are also key for fostering collaboration between governments and civil society to improve public sector efficiency and service delivery. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlight-ed the costs associated with delaying digitalization and GovTech implementation and the opportunities that lie in public sector modernization.WORLD BANK  ECA ECONOMIC UPDATE SPRING 2021
