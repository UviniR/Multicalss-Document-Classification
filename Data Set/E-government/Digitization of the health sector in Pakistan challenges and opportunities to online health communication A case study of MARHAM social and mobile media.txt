Digitization of the health sector in Pakistan:
challenges and opportunities to online health
communication: A case study of MARHAM
social and mobile media
Muhammad Ittefaq1and Azhar Iqbal2
Abstract
Objective: Social and mobile media are playing a significant role in the digitization of health sectors globally. New tech-
nology provides an opportunity for stakeholders (i.e., patients and healthcare professionals) to engage with each other invirtual environments to discuss health-related issues. This study examines the role of social and mobile media in digitizing
the health sector in Pakistan through MARHAM, the platform which is the subject of this case study.
Method: A thematic content analysis of MARHAM’s social media (Facebook group, Facebook page, and Twitter account) and
mobile media application (‘‘app’’ and website) were chosen for sampling. Some 6083 group posts, 1724 tweets and 1123Facebook posts populated our sample.
Results: Analysis results indicate that MARHAM’s Facebook group most often fields patient inquiries. The most discussed
health issues were: women’s health issues (43.23%), children’s diseases (16.63%), psychological issues (15.45%), dentalissues (9.50%), skin problems (5.93%), others (5.04%), and obesity (4.19%). MARHAM’s Facebook page and Twitter accountwere mainly used for health education and awareness. Their mobile application and website were used by healthcareprofessionals and for patient registration.
Conclusion: The study’s results suggest that MARHAM is playing a significant role in the health sector of Pakistan, addressing
primarily women and children’s issues through their Facebook group. Like many who have an online presence, MARHAMfaces certain challenges, including the public’s low literacy rates and scant Internet access.

Introduction
The role of social and new media in the health sector
has emerged as a fascinating area of research for health
communication scholars. Currently, eﬀorts are beingmade to digitize the health sector by governments andcorporate sectors globally. Issues related to health digit-ization are being explored in various forms, includingproblems around smartphone use in public health,
1
online patient engagement,2measurement of alcohol
intoxication through digital devices,3and ‘‘online sub-
stance-use,’’ eﬀectiveness, and harmfulness.4However,these studies are focused on developed nations such as

Australia, Canada, and the US. This is due to develop-
ing nations lagging in new technology infrastructureand adoption that signiﬁcantly revolutionizes andaﬀects the health sector. As such, low- and middle-income nations
5such as Pakistan and India face
many challenges in providing quality and aﬀordable
health services to their citizens.
In Pakistan, health problems increase daily and treat-
ment is scarce due to poor ﬁnancial, economic, andenvironmental conditions.
6Poverty is the paramount
reason for poor health conditions. Past scholars havelinked health with poverty and have substantiallydemonstrated the strong causal link.
7To counter various
diseases and health problems, citizens need to be edu-
cated, enjoy a strong economic situation, have access
to the latest equipment, and most importantly, a consist-ent and established relationship with healthcare profes-sionals.
8In Pakistan, individuals avoid using state-
provided medical facilities because of their ‘‘poor qual-ity’’ and ‘‘unreliability.’’
9A survey of Pakistani govern-
ment hospitals10suggested that the behavior of hospital
administration, the irresponsible attitudes of healthcare
professionals (HCPs), and the illiteracy as well as pov-
erty of citizens deters the Pakistani people from usingstate and public hospitals for treatment.
There are many challenges to improving the health-
care system in Pakistan. Key challenges include healthsector corruption, a growing national population, andcontinued low literacy rates. According to the 2017Transparency International
11report, Pakistan ranked
117/180 countries and its corruption score was 32/100
(0 means most corrupt and 100 means highly clean).Another report by Transparency International
12
claimed that the health sector continues to be thethird most corrupt state department in Pakistan, aranking it ﬁrst achieved in 2009, rising from seventhposition.
12According to the United Nations
International Children’s Emergency Fund
(UNICEF),13Pakistan has a 78.8 per 1000 children
under 5 years of age mortality rate. Meanwhile, thecountry’s education sector speaks volumes about itscorruption and administrative issues. Pakistan issecond worst in the world for school dropout, 5.1 mil-lion in 2010 /C151two-thirds of which were girls. In 2010,
the national education budget was 2.3% of Pakistan’sGNP.
14The most recent census indicates that Pakistan
has reached a record high population of 207.7 million,
which makes it the ﬁfth largest country in the world. Analarming example that illustrates the birth-rate explo-sion is a Pakistani male who had sired 36 children fromthree diﬀerent wives by the age of 57, and was urged totake a fourth wife.
15
Pakistan’s younger generation has embarked on a
few initiatives in diﬀerent sectors, including health
and new media technology, to bring about societalchange. In a very short time they have generated a
number of thriving startups in the country.16
MARHAM: digital health initiative in Pakistan
MARHAM (a health sector startup in Pakistan) was
established in January 2016 as a private initiative to
digitize and facilitate the health industry of Pakistan.As the startup’s website states:
Together we can share the burden of those ﬁghting a
disease.
A month after its founding, MARHAM created its
Facebook group, Facebook page, and Twitter handle.
Its venues provide users with the ability to book appoint-ments online, locate nearby MARHAM-registered doc-tors, or post their queries online to get second opinionsfrom HCPs. The startup was the ﬁrst of its kind inPakistan, and was also among the top seven startupsinitiated in Pakistan in recent years. The Express
Tribune noted the app’s seminal functionality: ‘‘connect-
ing doctors and patients with the tap of a ﬁnger’’.
17As
compared to the old, traditional methods of bookingappointments with HCPs, the mobile app providesopportunities for patients and HCPs to connect witheach other through technology. ‘‘Find doctors withmobile app ‘Marham’ in Pakistan’’
18is how one news
outlet referenced the startup’s technological capabilities.Ahmed and Sheikh
9argued that people do not go to
governmental hospitals because of administrative prob-
lems and poor health quality The app’s aim is to makesure healthcare access becomes easier than it has everbeen.
16Today, the country is living in the age of the
Internet and social media, and MARHAM is partiallyresponsible for that change. The new mobile app aims torevolutionize the healthcare system in Pakistan.
19
From a scholarly standpoint, there is a lack of
research exploring the role of digitization in public sec-
tors, particularly health. From a Pakistani context, nosigniﬁcant scientiﬁc study has been conducted to inves-tigate the role of new media technology in catering tothe needs of the people in the health sector. Identifyinga substantial gap in established literature, we analyzedthe role of the newly developed MARHAM applicationto facilitate online health communication across
Pakistan. We analyzed MARHAM’s Facebook
group, Facebook page, and Twitter handle, as well asits mobile application and website through a thematiccontent analysis.
Role of social and mobile media in health sector
While social media oﬀer an opportunity for patients to
obtain immediate and cost-eﬀective advice from HCPs,2 DIGITAL HEALTHit also poses many challenges to online health commu-
nication. Previous scholars have explored the relation-ship between patients and HCPs via social and mobilemedia. One study analyzed meta data about the use ofsocial media to build relationships between HCPs andpatients. They measured the eﬀects of relationship-
building on patients.
8Other scholars have suggested
that the Government Digital Service model is beingused in the transformation of the health sector by gov-ernments. Unfortunately the adopted method is nottransparent.
20In addition, digital tools have become
great sources for medical awareness and education forpatients to share information about their health prob-lems and connect with clinicians.
21As Roland sug-
gested in her study, ‘‘the core beneﬁt of social media
in medicine, is always likely to remain an individualchoice in the same way as you have a choice in howto write’’ (p.1).
21Mesko explored the importance of
online searching for medical treatment content andtime management tools.
22He claimed in his study
that, back in 2008, it was time consuming to look ata blog related to medical education, but now social
media has brought this capability to every cell phone
and digital device.
Ventola investigated the use of purpose-built appli-
cations in the health ﬁeld and their importance forHCPs.
23The study’s results argued that HCPs use
mobile devices and software applications for ﬁve pur-poses: ‘‘administration, health record maintenance andaccess, communications and consulting, reference and
information gathering, and medical education’’ (p.2).
Ventola’s study was more focused on HCPs’ use ofdigital devices but it did not consider patients andHCPs as the target audience. Our study is audience-centered and identiﬁes what users can receive fromtheir use of digital devices in health communication.This study is audience-centered because social mediausers are the target audience of the MARHAM net-
work and we analyzed audience health-related inquiries
to examine the possible topics discussed in theMARHAM Facebook group. Mesko
22wanted to iden-
tify the latest trends in the ﬁeld and interconnectivitythrough these digital devices. But the questions are:where are the audiences? What have HCPs done forpatients through digital devices? Do HCPs try toshare their expertise through their blog, Facebook
pages, or Twitter handle? Are HCPs connected with
patients through digital devices? These open questionshave gone unanswered in many studies. Our study’sfocus is the engagement of both sides: HCPs andpatients. The interaction of both stakeholder groupsthrough new media technology is signiﬁcant and vitalto explore. For example, Benetoli et al.
24conducted a
focus group with 36 patients who used social media to
access health-related information. Their study revealedthat a patient’s use of social media was positively
impacted by their relationship with HCPs: the HCPs’interaction with patients through social media empow-ered the users.
Hawkins et al.
25argued that even though social
media use is increasing, engagement with HCPs can
be challenging for users. Since the inception of
MARHAM’s accessibility to engage the communityonline with HCPs, their Facebook group has accumu-lated 112,479 people and 80,000 have ‘‘liked’’ theirFacebook page. Their Twitter has very few followersbecause the users of this social platform are less trendyin Pakistan compared with Facebook. Individuals arenot only sharing their problems on social media, they
are also commenting and responding to those posts.
26
For example, researchers conducted a survey in Italy
about the sharing of antibiotic-related information onthe Internet and social media. They conducted a cross-sectional study with a two-stage cluster sampling. Thestudy concluded that the ‘‘Internet and social media arewidely used for antibiotic-related information seekingin the Italian population’’ (p.7).
26
Prasad27noted that social media’s image is ‘‘the
equivalent of a surgical scalpel—both are excellenttools but only if they are used appropriately andwisely’’ (p.4). He suggested the power of social mediais important and diﬀerent in raising one’s proﬁle on theInternet. Scholars focused on regional studies for exam-ple
26conducted a survey on an Italian population;
Benetoli et al.24undertook their study with Australian
participants; Saeed and Ibrahim10discussed problems
faced by people from government hospitals in Karachi;and Coathup et al.

An overview of Pakistan’s use of social and
mobile media in health sector
The Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB) is
the ﬁrst and leading government institution workingtoward the digitalizing of Pakistan in terms of newmedia and technology. The institution
aims at not only modernizing the governance tech-
niques through transparency induced methods butalso at increasing the digital literacy of the citizens /C151
among many other services. PITB is committed to
eﬀectively and eﬃciently provide [ sic] IT services and
infrastructure to the government and local and inter-national businesses (p.1).
28
According to the PITB website, several projects have
been successfully completed and more continue, butthere remains a long way to go. PITB renders its service
to the health, law and order, education, agriculture,Ittefaq and Iqbal 3and transportation sectors. In the health sector, PITB is
working on e-vaccinations, disease surveillance sys-tems, a Dengue Activity Tracking System, a biometricattendance system for health facilities, monitoring sys-tems for a polio campaign, a drug inspection and moni-toring evaluation system, and a medicine procurement
and drug testing laboratory automation program
(p.2).
28
The Dengue Activity Tracking System was success-
ful in combating dengue fever across the province ofPunjab during 2012 /C15113. Rana
29stated that 252,935
cases of dengue fever were reported, 17,057 were con-ﬁrmed by laboratory tests, and deaths totaled 219 in2011. However, at the end of 2013 there were 9037
cases and only 2,164 conﬁrmed by the laboratory
with no reported deaths. This success story illustratesthe eﬀective use of new technology to control denguefever in Pakistan.
Further, Pakistan’s telecommunication sector is
growing daily. The Express Tribune described its
technological changes in stating that Pakistan’s ITsector had gone through an historic move in the past
few years and the country had taken the lead in adopt-
ing new technology.
30Another report by the Dawn illu-
strated the rise in social and mobile media usage inPakistan, but noted that the Internet is still notcommon in the country.
31
Hussain et al.32investigated the impact of social
and mobile media practices in Pakistan. They analyzedthe issues faced by active Facebook users across
Pakistan. Their survey was conducted in the four
largest cities of Pakistan including Islamabad, Lahore,Quetta, and Peshawar. Questions were asked ofthe respondents about privacy, fake accounts requests,unwanted advertisements, and multimedia issues. Amixed-methods approach was applied to examine theproblems faced by Facebook users. The resultsrevealed that 30% to 55% of people complain, but
11% to 30% of users do not complain about the
issues on Facebook.
Another example of adopting digital platforms
regards the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s(KPK) health department actively using social mediato inform and educate the provincial public. TheKPK health department joined social media in 2016;currently, they have 19,400 Twitter followers, and
their Facebook page has 62,538 likes and 63,050 fol-
lowers. This eﬀective social media use by the adminis-tration, shows that Pakistanis are adopting newtechnology in the health sector.
33The numbers are
better than other provincial health departments whodo not have a social media presence. The KPKhealth department website is user-friendly and colorfulcompared with other provincial health department
websites.Based on the presented research, we proposed the
following research questions to address in this study:
RQ1: What are the most discussed health issues in
MARHAM’s Facebook group?RQ2: What are the key challenges and opportunities to
the digital health process in Pakistan?
RQ3: How is MARHAM contributing to the digitalhealth sector in Pakistan?
Method
Data collection, study design and sample
We answered the previous outlined questions with a
mixed-methods approach. This exploratory study wasthe ﬁrst ever conducted in Pakistan regarding the digit-ization of the health sector. First, we carried out aqualitative content analysis of social media posts ofthe MARHAM Facebook closed group, Facebookpage, and Twitter tweets for possible categories. The
unit of analysis was text posted on all social media
platforms. We excluded photos and videos from theanalysis to remain focused on our research questions.The unit of analysis is important for a study.
34Pakistan
has 51% male, 48.76% female, and 0.24% transgenderpopulation.
35Men have higher literacy rates (69%)
than women (45%) in Pakistan.36According to the
annual report of the Pakistan Telecommunication
Authority,37only 19% of people have access to the
Internet in Pakistan. In the quantitative part, we usedthe descriptive statistics for the female and malesample. We then used statistical analysis to identifythe percentages of the most discussed health issues inthe MARHAM Facebook group.
We retrieved the data from social media (Facebook
page posts and Twitter tweets). We used Python 2 to
fetch Facebook posts and Tweepy library for Twitter
tweets. For Facebook, we typed the user name of thepage: @marham.pk. We used a Facebook token, whichcan be obtained from https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer. After applying this token, the systemextracted the complete data from the Facebook page.The system extracted the data ﬁle into a CSV ﬁle. Weconverted the ﬁle into an Excel spreadsheet to analyze
the frequencies of reactions, likes, shares, and com-
ments. The total number of statuses was 1124 fromFebruary 2016 through February 2018. For Twitter,tweets were extracted through the TweepyApplication Programming Interface (API) withPython software to access the complete tweets data.The total number of tweets posted by the MARHAMTwitter handle from February 2016 until February
2018 was 1724. MARHAM’s Facebook group data4 DIGITAL HEALTHwas provided by the MARHAM organization. The
Facebook group is a closed group and nobody canretrieve the posts without the organization’s authority.For the Facebook group data we used a six-month timeframe to answer the research questions. We selected thesix-month time frame to run from June /C151December
2017. The total number of posts during these six
months was 6083. These 6083 posts in theMARHAM group were suﬃcient to answer the ﬁrst
research question and to give an overview of the mostdiscussed health issues in the MARHAM Facebookgroup during this period.
We developed a comprehensive Excel spreadsheet to
code the data. We analyzed the text manually through
predeﬁned categories. We used the categories for which
MARHAM is providing a services to patients throughits social and mobile media forums. We applied adeductive approach to analyzing the Facebook grouptext, the Facebook page, and Twitter tweets.MARHAM facilitates citizens in the following cate-gories: gynecologist, Ear-Nose-Throat (ENT), gastro-enterologist, orthopedic, neuro physician, general
physician, cardiologist, psychiatrist, neurosurgeon,
and pulmonologist.
38While keeping in mind these cate-
gories, we categorized the content of posts into sevenbroad types: 1) women’s health issues (pregnancy, per-iods, infertility, and breast feeding), 2) dental issues, 3)skin problems, 4) psychological problems (stress,depression, anxiety, looking for a psychologist, andtension), 5) obesity (weight loss/gain), 6) children’s dis-
eases, and 7) others (cough, typhoid, diabetes, hair loss,
diarrhea, malaria, HIV, ﬁts, snoring, heart attack, chol-era, hepatitis, dengue, stomach, kidney, ulcer, liver,blood pressure, and asthma). To develop these cate-gories we used a qualitative approach; after identifyingthe main themes and topics we quantiﬁed the data andused the frequencies of the themes via the quantitativeapproach. Table 1 shows the derived categories from
the text while looking at the specializations we used to
answer our second research question.
For the qualitative part of the analysis we used inter-
coder reliability according to the Holsti
39formula for
nominal data. For example, reliability ¼2M/N 1þN2;
N1represents one coder, N 2represents the second
coder, while M represents the decisions made by bothcoders. The 86% intercoder reliability level was
achieved, which was suﬃcient to investigate the coded
data. Descriptive analysis was used to analyze thedemographics of users. We used a quantitativeapproach to answer RQ1. For RQ2 we applied adeductive qualitative content analysis approach.According to the Elo and Kyngas
40the ‘‘deductive
approach is useful if the general aim was to test a pre-vious theory in a diﬀerent situation’’ (p.107). To answer
RQ3 we used an interpretive analysis of the patients’inquiries and analyzed the available features of the
mobile application.
MARHAM used two platforms, social and mobile
media, to facilitate the patients and HCPs in Pakistan.Social media included their Facebook page, Facebookgroup, and Twitter account, while mobile media
included a mobile application and website. Social and
mobile media were divided into three main categories tomake it easier for analysis, for example, 1) Facebookpage and Twitter account, 2) mobile application andwebsite, and 3) Facebook group. We did not includethe Facebook group in Category 1 because theFacebook closed group is only used for queries, whilethe Facebook page and Twitter handle are used for
health awareness and education. We categorized on
the basis of their purpose. The website and applicationwere being used for one main purpose, to registerpatients and HCPs or for appointments. TheFacebook page and Twitter account were being usedfor health awareness and education, for example, howyou can avoid developing a cough. The Facebookgroup was mainly used for patient inquiries and health-
care professional guidelines for them.
Results
Most discussed health issues in MARHAM
Facebook in the group group
The 6083 group posts were analyzed to answer our ﬁrst
research question. We found that, as per our predeﬁned
disease categories, the most discussed health issues in theMARHAM Facebook closed group were women’s healthissues (pregnancy, periods, infertility, and breast feeding;n¼2630, 43.23%), children’s diseases ( n¼1012, 16.63%),
psychological problems (stress, depression, anxiety, look-ing for psychologist, and tension; n¼940, 15.45%),
dental issues ( n¼578, 9.50%), skin problems ( n¼361,
5.93%), others (cough, typhoid, diabetes, hair loss, diar-
rhea, malaria, HIV, ﬁts, snoring, heart attack, cholera,hepatitis dengue, stomach, kidney, ulcer, liver, blood pres-sure, and asthma) ( n¼307, 5.04%), and obesity (weight
loss/gain) ( n¼255, 4.19%). It is pertinent to mention that
we considered children’s diseases under the age of 5 years.While posting questions people mentioned children’s agesso we coded those diseases under this category.
The most discussed health-related issues in the
MARHAM Facebook group included women’s healthissues, which constituted 43.23% of all issues discussed.Most of the queries were related to pregnancy, periods,infertility, and breast feeding. The second most discussedhealth problem was related to children’s diseases (63%).For example, untimely sleep patterns, baby’s crying,baby’s diet, and fever, etc. The least discussed health
issues were skin problems (5.93%) and others, includingIttefaq and Iqbal 5cough, temperature, hepatitis, and snoring, etc. (5.04%).
Figure 1 indicates the MARHAM Facebook group users’gender. As Figure 1 depicts, the number of female users inthe group is higher than male users. Most users fall underthe 25 /C15134 age category. The second highest number of
users falls under the 18 /C15124 age category. More than 60%
of Pakistan’s population is considered to be youth.
41
MARHAM has more than 1.5 million users across
Pakistan and abroad on both social and mobile media.
So far, 375,416 people have booked online appointmentsin 17 cities in Pakistan since January 2016. As perMARHAM’s Facebook group, they provide services toﬁve patients per minute in Pakistan’s 17 cities.MARHAM has users in many countries. Figure 2 rep-resents the top 10 countries where MARHAM has mostusers. Pakistan ( n¼90,084), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
(n¼3899), India ( n¼3272), United Arab Emirates(n¼2928), United Sates of America ( n¼1667), United
Kingdom ( n¼1482), Australia ( n¼833), Canada
(n¼799), Bangladesh ( n¼708), and Uganda ( n¼563).
These countries have the highest number of MARHAMonline users. According to The Express Tribune the cur-
rent statistics show that Saudi Arabia is the favorite des-tination of Pakistanis to ﬁnd employment. Saudi Arabiahas 2.6 million Pakistani workers, United Kingdom has
1.7 million Pakistanis, and United Arab Emirates holds
the fourth place having most Pakistanis with 1.6 millionand United States is ﬁfth with 900,350 Pakistani jobholders.

Thank you.6 DIGITAL HEALTHservices MARHAM provides to its users, including a
health forum, free medical advice, a second opinion
about issues, a weight loss program, and blog throughthe MARHAM application. By 31st of December 2017,MARHAM had uploaded their video, which showedthat 12,000 doctors had already registered throughtheir online application. More than 20,000 authenticonline cases were dealt with and consultations wereprovided, with more than 2900 reviews for guidance
to others. This video was liked by 254 people and had
39 comments.
Facebook page and Twitter account
Table 2 presents the total number of Facebook pageposts: 1123 including four events, 559 photos, 23 sta-tuses, and 111 videos. The 1724 Twitter tweets were
examined to answer our ﬁrst research question.MARHAM joined Twitter in February 2016. So far,
the MARHAM Twitter account has not been veryactive. We measured the activeness of Twitter andFacebook with ﬁve tweets and posts per day. The
Facebook page of the MARHAM has more than
79,000 likes and 80,000 followers. MARHAM isaddressing health issues via social media networks.Within two years, MARHAM got immediate responsethrough its online presence, but the interactivity with itsfollowers is very low. The average share per post is only2.70 and 2.74 comments, which illustrates that theirFacebook page is not source of discussion for the
patients or HCPs. The Facebook page and Twitter
account are mainly being used for awareness-raisingpurposes. The health blog posts are shared on theseplatforms.
MARHAM has more followers than the provincial
health departments of Pakistan, but reactionsshowed low interactivity online. There could be manyfactors underlying this, however, despite having
more than 80,000 followers, there was not even 1% of
interactivity found from stakeholders (patients andHCPs). There was no diﬀerence with their Twitterhandle; Twitter even had a lower rate of reactionsand interactivity, for example, an average of 2.47tweets per day and no replies, likes, or retweets.With 457 followers on Twitter, there was a reactionaverage of zero. The Internet World Stats
43showed
that there were 32 million Facebook users in
Pakistan. On the other hand, Twitter has 3.1 millionusers in Pakistan.
44
We analyzed the Facebook posts and Twitter tweets
through correlation analysis and found there was 99%similarity in the Facebook posts’ and Twitter tweets’content.

Figure 3. MARHAM users in top eight cities of Pakistan.8 DIGITAL HEALTHMARHAM mobile application and official website
MARHAM’s mobile app and website are used for
appointment bookings, and patient and healthcare pro-fessional registration. According to the latest statistics,more than 12,000 HCPs have registered withMARHAM. However, 1215 HCPs are available
through their extended proﬁles, while others do not
have complete proﬁles on the MARHAM mobile appand website. Male HCPs number 827 (68%) and femaleHCPs total 388 (32%). This ratio is only for those whohave extended proﬁles on MARHAM’s website andmobile app. Table 4 illustrates healthcare professional’sspecializations across 10 health areas. Apart from therole of gynecologist, there are fewer female HCPs in
every ﬁeld compared with male, which strongly associ-
ates with the low literacy rates found among women inPakistan. According to the latest data provided byMARHAM, most of the HCPs prefer to register withMARHAM via their website rather than through themobile app. Similarly, patients feel more comfortableusing the website compared with the mobile app.
Table 4 denotes the HCPs ( n¼495) who are dealing
with selected categories and MARHAM’s main services
related to these diseases. There are fewer females inthese categories compared with male HCPs (male:n¼346, 70%; female: n¼149, 30%). The large
number of general physicians are registered under theselected categories ( n¼125, 25%) male and ( n¼46,
09%) female. The least number are registered asneuro physicians/neuro surgeons: male ( n¼11),
female ( n¼1). The organization launched a mobile
app supported by android and IOS systems inJanuary 2016. The mobile oﬀers a diversity offeatures to patients and HCPs, including the optionsto post a question, book online healthcare professionalappointments, and read about health issues. Table 5shows the statistics of the mobile app and its rankingand features.
MARHAM: prospects and challenges
MARHAM has played a signiﬁcant role in the onlinehealth communication process in Pakistan sinceJanuary 2016. The startup is enabling deprivedPakistani communities to ask their questions directlyto HCPs through the MARHAM Facebook group
and mobile app. They are providing opportunities forthe people of Pakistan who cannot aﬀord expensive
healthcare to access a range of professionals 24/7.However, as Pakistan is a developing country,MARHAM faces several challenges in persuading indi-
viduals to adopt a digital culture of health-related
issues. Pakistani citizens do not tend to be ‘‘tech-savvy’’ due to the low literacy rate and because one-third of the population lives below the poverty line.Almost 60 million people live below the poverty linein Pakistan: they earn less than US $30.00 permonth.
45The main challenge for many Pakistanis is
with HCPs who charge thousands of Pakistani rupee
in fees for a checkup. Certainly in this way they are
being treated well and provided with quality healthcare,but the majority of them cannot aﬀord it. Meanwhile,MARHAM is represents an opening for the Pakistanicommunity to consult professionals about their prob-lems through social and mobile media.
Currently, MARHAM is expanding into the
small cities of Pakistan, but there is long way to go.
For example, there were no users from KashmirTable 4. Healthcare professional’s specializations and gender

of Baluchistan, KPK, and Sindh province, which areless progressive regions than Punjab province. Thesecond challenge is that more than 60% of the popula-tion of Pakistan lives in rural areas. The less than 40%
of people living in urban areas can book appointments,
ask questions online, and consult about their healthproblems anytime, but what about the 60% who livesin rural areas, people who do not have access to theInternet? What about people who do not have HCPs intheir local areas? Simply focusing on urban areas andparticular audiences does not seem to be practical forkeeping in view the large number of people living in
rural areas of the country.
Another challenge relates to dealing with fake doctors.
Yes, MARHAM has a mechanism to deal with this, butthis problem necessitates a comprehensive plan and strat-egy at governmental and corporate level to address thisphenomenon. They do have a veriﬁcation system via thePakistan Medical Association, however, this mechanismis ineﬀective for the ongoing debate about fake doctors.
There is a need to address not only fake clinicians and
HCPs but also bogus clinics. For example: fake HCPshave worked in government and well-reputed hospitalsfor many months: Dawn reported, ‘‘Fake neurosurgeon
worked at Lahore’s Services Hospital for eightmonths’’.
46The problem of fake degrees that occurs in
every discipline including the medical ﬁelds also repre-sents a challenge at state and corporate levels. The
Punjab Healthcare Commission has closed almost 6000
bogus treatment centers since 2015. The closed establish-ments included hospitals, laboratories, and homeopathicclinics that were involved in malpractices across thePunjab province.
47Furthermore, the ratio of people to
doctors in Pakistan also fails to meet international health-care standards.
Discussion
The journey into digital health processes does not havea long history in Pakistan. The MARHAM initiativebegan two years ago and subsequently launched as afacilitator of an online health sector. The impact of theinitiative has proved tremendous in terms of cases dealtwith, the number of online bookings, and registration
of the 12,000 HCPs through the web and mobile app.The organization has increased the number of followers
on social media and group members able to discusstheir health-related problems with the tap of ﬁnger.MARHAM’s social media statistics will change infuture studies because numbers are continuously grow-
ing. Facebook’s response to patient inquiries is very
immediate and they have 16 group moderators andadministrators to respond rapidly.
On the other hand, the following limitations must be
considered when interpreting the ﬁndings presented. First,the sample for this study did not turn out to be ideal foranswering the research questions. The selectedMARHAM’s Facebook group has a huge number of
postings whereas its Facebook page and Twitter account
has less activity. From the Facebook page and Twitteraccount the whole data were used as sample; for theFacebook group we used only time frames (six months).The Facebook page had 1123 posts, the Facebook grouphad 6083 posts and Twitter had 1724 tweets in two years.As a result, the sample for this study was not suﬃcientlybalanced /C151too many MARHAM Facebook group posts
and fewer Facebook page postings and Twitter tweets /C151
and contained insuﬃcient interaction on Twitter and theFacebook page. Twitter is less popular in developingcountries because of its features. Twitter is considered anetwork for professionals, therefore MARHAM does nothave real engagement with the general population thoughTwitter. The low interaction of users on Twitter indicatesthat people are frequent users of mobile application and
Facebook group. Twitter does not provide feature like
groups, as on Facebook, this is one of the reasons whythere is low interactivity among users and HCPs from theMARHAM network.
MARHAM users not only reside in Pakistan but in
the Gulf States, and western countries including theUnited States, the UK, and Australia, where millionsof Pakistani have lived for several decades. The use of
MARHAM social and mobile media suggest that the
Pakistani diaspora is also connected though new tech-nology. The borderless technology is linking peoplefrom a local to a global level. Appadurai
48suggests
that the ‘‘technoscape’’ has played a signiﬁcant role inconnecting communities across the world. There aremillions of Pakistanis living abroad and the newmedia and technology has shrunk the distances
making communication easier than before.Table 5. MARHAM Google Play Store update on 15 March 2018.

of the MARHAM Facebook group posts was con-sidered for analysis. We are generalizing our six-month results over other missing 1.5 years regardingthe most discussed topics. Our study was regionallyfocused and has practical implications for the govern-
ment of Pakistan to pay attention to over the emerging
trends in digital health. For instance, provincial healthdepartments should use social and mobile media tofacilitate online health communication. State and prov-ince websites should be updated and user-friendly.Furthermore, the MARHAM initiative should beencouraged and the government should take steps toprovide quality healthcare facilities for its citizens.
The Express Tribune revealed that the government of
Pakistan was spending US $9.3 per person, far less thanthe international standard, which is $60.00. The reportclaimed that 8 /C1519 million pepole were aﬀected by
Hepatitus-C, 0.6 million people had tuberculosis, andalmost 410,000 people were aﬀected every year. Theannual detected cases of malaria number 500,000.

The existing literature in digital health suggests that
new media and technology are playing an important
role in informing and educating people regardinghealth issues. Similarly, this study’s ﬁndings arguethat the Pakistani community has an opportinuty toadopt the new technology in the health sector.MARHAM is the ﬁrst startup in Pakistan’s healthsector, facilitating the process of online bookings,enabling people to ﬁnd nearby HCPs and hospitals in
all major cities of Paksitan. Online health communica-
tion between patients and HCPs is not common inPakistan. It is worth mentioning here that Pakistanisociety is a conservative society where women havemany problems in terms of education especially, andadult education, which is related to their health prob-lems, however, the MARHAM platform provides afacility for all people regardless of gender, race, or ethi-
nicty to ask questions in Facebook group or through
the mobile application. Although digital health andhealth communication literature claims that it isnormal practice in developed countries to communicatewith HCPs, this is not always the case in developingand conservative societies such as Pakistan.
Conclusion
Although this study has its limitations, it nonethelesscontributes insight to the growing ﬁeld of the digitizationof the health sector. This study focused on the role ofsocial and mobile media in health communication inPakistan. The present study’s data revealed possibleeﬀects related to topics posted by the Facebook groupand the number of discussed health-related issues based
on healthcare engagement and user questions. Thestudy’s results concluded that MARHAM is playing
an important role in digitizing the health sector. Thereis a long way to go to make this kind of projects andinitiatives successful and adoptable for citizens. Untilnow, MARHAM’s focus has only been on urban areasbecause there is less Internet usage in rural areas com-
pared with urban. Secondly, HCPs prefer to stay in
urban areas and rural populations have to visit nearbycities for regular and emergency medical checkups. Newtechnology should be a mechanism to facilitate the ruralpopulation’s access to healthcare.
The results suggest that the occurrence of online
health communication eﬀects also depends on how dif-ferent HCPs and patients using social and mobile media
engage with each other. Finally, future studies might
employ mixed-methods approaches to not only analyzepublished content, but also interview HCPs and con-duct surveys with social media users and MARHAMusers to gain insight into the impact of the MARHAMinitiative on HCPs and patients. MARHAM is the ﬁrstinitiative in Pakistan to facilitate online health commu-nication through new technology. There is need for
such initiatives at governmental level to digitize the
health sector ensuring it becomes accessible to its citi-zens on mass. Overall, MARHAM is an opportunityfor a deprived Pakistani community to adopt a newtechnology within the health sector.
