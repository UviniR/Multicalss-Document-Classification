Summary  
This paper begins by locating the Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition 
project (GODAN) in the context of wider debates in the open data move ment by 
first reviewing the literature on open data (OD) and open data for agriculture and 
nutrition (ODAN).  
The review identifies a number of important gaps and limitations in the existing 
literature. There has been no independent evaluation of who most b enefits or 
who is being left behind regarding ODAN. There has been no independent 
evaluation of gender or diversity in ODAN or of the development outcomes or 
impacts of ODAN. The existing research on ODAN is over -reliant on key open 
data organisations and open data insiders who produce most of the research. 
This creates bias in the data and analysis. The authors recommend that these 
gaps are addressed in future research.  
The paper contributes a novel conceptual  ‘SCOTA’  framework  for analysing the 
barriers to and drivers of open data adoption, which could be readily applied in 
other domains. Using this framework  to review the existing literature highlights 
the fact that ODAN research and practice has been predominantly supply -side 
focused on the production of open data. The authors argue that if open data is to 
‘leave no one behind’ , greater attention now needs to be paid to understanding 
the demand -side of the equation and the role of intermediaries. The paper 
argues that there is  a compelling need to improve the participation of women, 
people living with disabilities, and other marginalised groups in all aspects of 
open data for agriculture and nutrition. The authors see a need for further 
research and action to enhance the capabi lities of marginalised people to make 
effective use of open data.  
The paper concludes with the recommendation that an independent strategic 
review of open data in agriculture and nutrition is overdue. Such a review should 
encompass the structural factors s haping the process of ODAN ; include a focus 
on the intermediary and demand -side processes ; and identify who benefits and 
who is being left behind.

 1. Introduction  
This paper reviews the existing literature on Open Data for Agriculture and 
Nutrition  (ODAN). The review was commissioned as a background paper for a 
performance evaluation of the Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition 
programme (GODAN). GODAN was established to help secure the potential 
development benefits of producing and using open data for agriculture and 
nutrition. GODAN’s founding objectives include (a)  empowering  the ecosystem  
of organisations working on open data for agriculture and nutrition by working 
with policymakers to provide an enabling environment ; and (b) increasing the 
supply and use  of open data to stimulate innovation, equitable access, 
transparency and accountabil ity, service delivery , and economic growth (Carolan 
2016). These objectives inform the scope of this review.  
This paper begins by first locating GODAN in the context of the wider open data 
movement. It reviews the literature on open data ( OD), then open da ta for 
agriculture and nutrition ( ODAN ), before focusing in on GODAN  specifically. The 
literature review was neither systematic nor exhaustive due to time and resource 
restrictions. The desk -based research was carried out during February and 
March of 2020 using an iterative process in which the focus and scope was 
adapted to reflect the emergent needs of the performance evaluation. Relevant 
literature was identified in consultation with domain experts, by using snowballing 
and reverse snowballing techniques , and using Google Scholar to identify more 
than 100 unique sources. The review identified significantly more existing 
literature on OD than on ODAN , and very little on GODAN specifically. The 
review also found that the existing literature on ODAN and GODA N is over -
dependent on studies and reports produced by the GODAN  programme and 
affiliates , and would benefit from alternative perspectives. The literature review 
produced a new conceptual framework for analysing open data initiatives, which 
helps to identi fy opportunities to improve access, effective use and equity of 
application. The framework can be readily applied to open data in domains other 
than agriculture and nutrition. The literature review identifies gaps in the existing 
research and makes recomme ndations for future ODAN policy and practice. 
These include the need to improve the participation of women, people living with 
disabilities, and other marginalised groups in all aspects of open data for 
agriculture and nutrition.  
The next section begins w ith some issues of definition before outlining the history 
and rationale of open data for development.

 2. Open data 
Although there is no universally agreed definition, the Open Knowledge 
Foundation defines open data as ‘data that can be  freely used, modified,  and 
shared  by anyone  for any purpose’ .1 In an increasingly digital world this definition 
refers predominantly to digital data that is easy to access and free to download in 
a format readily processed on a computer and which is made available under an 
open source licence. To facilitate making di gital data open , the FAIR Data 
Principles2 are a set of guidelines for making open data Findable, Accessible, 
Interoperable and Reusable to all stakeholders in the relevant ecosystem3 (cited 
in Wilkinson et al.  2016 ). Pawelke et al.  (2017) are among thos e to argue that 
the binary categories of open and closed data do not reflect the reality that most 
data is neither fully open nor fully closed, and can be made to move along the 
continuum between the two.  
The term ‘open data ’ was first used in 1995 by sci entists who argued that the 
public interest in tackling climate and environmental change required institutions 
to open and share data to advance the public interest (Chignard 2013). The 
open data movement is an alliance of diverse actors with a range of mo tivations 
but the shared goals of increasing the supply of open data, adoption of open 
data policies, and building capacity to enable the effective use of open data for 
social benefit. Advocates of open data have argued that we should move from a 
position where data is closed by default to a situation where it is open by default 
so that everyone is able to use it without permission, controls, or restrictions 
(ibid.). The rationale behind open data includes the proposition that the opening 
up of data will le ad to greater scrutiny of data, improve its quality, and enable its 
innovative use to create value for the public good (Davies et al. 2019) . 
2.1 Open government data  
An initial target for the open data movement was to open up government  data. 
Government departments hold significant amounts of data that is ‘closed’ or not 
readily accessible (often not even to other ministries). This government data 
includes, but is not limited to, information on weather, land use, nutrition, health  
care, education, and economics. As government data is produced with public 
funds, members of the open data movement argued that it should be made 
freely available to the public, for the public benefit. It was argued that some of the

3  The term ‘ ecosystem ’ in this paper refers to a network of stakeholder organisations which are all 
involved in a product or service through either cooperation or competition, including producers, 
distributors, customers, regulators, government agencies, research institutes, etc.

 specific advantages of open data would be to increase transparency, enable 
accountability, and stimulate innovation and economic growth ( Open Data 
Institute  2018 ). Where government data has been opened , this has enabled the 
innovation of mobile apps and online platforms includin g those that enable 
citizens to check the voting record of elected representatives , to report problems 
to local government , to live-track buses and trains , and to check crop prices4 at 
multiple markets in real time (Pawelke et al.  2017). Critical voices h ave 
cautioned that claims for the radical potential of open data often underplay the 
obduracy of political power and risk reproducing old inequalities (McGee and 
Edwards 2016). This view is supported by the findings of Berdou and Lokers 
(2019) in their gui delines for the use of open nutritional data, which emphasise 
the importance of political context in limiting or enabling the impact of open data 
use in social change.  
In 2007, advocates of open government data met and produced the Sebastopol 
Principles fo r Open Government Data, which argued that data should be 
complete, primary, timely, accessible, machine -processable, non -discriminatory, 
non-proprietary and licen ce-free.5 Since 2011, when the Open Government 
Partnership6 was founded, 78 countries have s igned up to a process where each 
member submits an action plan co -created with civil society that includes 
concrete commitments to enhance transparency, accountability and public 
participation in government (OGP 2018). However, commitment to gender equity 
remains a concern. In the most recent Open Data for Development Report 
(IDRC 2019),  despite  3,000 commitments made in country action plans, less 
than 1  per cent  of countries included any gender commitments. The Open 
Government Partnership has since set an ambitious target of 30  per cent  
gender -sensitive commitments by the end of 2020 ( ibid.). 
2.2 Open data ecosystems  
Open government data organisations are part of a wider global open data 
movement that requires coordination between a complex network of political , 
business, regulator, technical, practitioner, funder and research stakeholders 
(Open Data Institute  2018). Together, these organisations form the global open 
data ecosystem. Key coordinating initiatives at the global level include the Open 
Data for Devel opment network (OD4D), the Open Data Charter, the Open 
Government Partnership (OGP), the Open Data Barometer, the Impact Map, the 
Open Data Leaders Network, and the Open Data Working Group (Davies et al.  
2019). In recent years, partly in an effort to  become more demand -led and

and buyers in Kenya via  M-Farm .

 problem -oriented, the open data movement has shifted to focu s more  around 
regional, thematic, and issue -oriented initiatives ( ibid.). It can be useful to 
understand this emerging ecosystem using typologies of data sources, 
geogr aphies , or thematic sector s.  
In addition to government data, open data is increasingly drawn from other data 
sources  including private companies (e.g. satellite data), civil society 
organisations (e.g. funding data), academia (e.g. research data sets) and  even 
‘citizen data’ (including citizen science and crowdsourced data) (Pawelke et al.  
2017). This represents a shift away from open data being dependent primarily on 
open government data, and requires a broader alignment of protocols and 
standards across diverse actors in the private sector, civil society, and 
government (Davies and Perini 2016; Davies et al.  2019).  
As well as global open data networks there are local, national and regional 
networks. Open data initiatives with a global remit include the O pen Data for 
Development Network ,7 the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development 
Data and the Open Data Institute . Examples of geographic open data networks 
include the African Open Data Network (AODN), Open Data Asia and the 
Iniciativa Latinoamerica na por los Datos Abiertos (ILDA) .8 
 
Open data is now applied  in a wide range of thematic sectors  (Davies et al.  
2019)  including organisations established to support the  Open Government 
Partnership, the International Aid Transparency Initiative  (IATI) ,9 which focuses 
on opening data in the international development sector, and Publish What You 
Pay,10 which works to open data in the extractive industries sector. It is wit hin 
this global open data ecosystem that GODAN is located as the Global Open 
Data for Agriculture and Nutrition programme. The next section will introduce the 
open data for agriculture and nutrition sector and present the rationale for 
GODAN’s work.

 3. GODAN  
Agriculture and nutrition are two separate but inter -related sectors that have 
attracted the attention of the open data movement because of the development 
potential of open data to  benefit rural livelihoods, health and wellbeing. The 
challenge of facilitating the open data movement in agriculture and nutrition is 
increased by the volume and diversity of organisations in the ODAN sector .  
In contrast to other industries, agriculture has a relatively broad 
spectrum of stakeholders. A gricultural producers range from part -
time, small -scale farmers to high -tech multinational conglomerates, 
and supply chains begin in some of the world’s most remote areas. 
‘Farm to fork’ products go from being raw materials, through 
processing, trading, he dging and brokering to eventually make it to 
the customer’s table. All of the stakeholders involved in these 
processes are potential producers as well as consumers of data.  
(Allemang and Teegarden 2017)  
The diversity of non -standard and non -interoperable  data types and formats in 
the ODAN sector increases the complexity of the challenge. The theory of 
change for the Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition (GODAN) 
programme refers to this diversity , describing the sector as composing ‘an 
immensely c omplex system of actors from diverse fields, specialisations, 
jurisdiction and sectors of the economy acting individually and importantly, in 
concert’ ( Carolan 201 6). 
The G ODAN programme was  established in 2013 in response to these 
challenges to coordinate  stakeholders and improve the application of open data 
in the sector. The GODAN  vision statement reads:   
We are a group of actors working towards a world where the value 
chain for agriculture and nutrition is more efficient, innovative,  
equitable (e.g. by gender , socio -economic status) and accountable; 
from, for example greater yields and access to markets for farmers, 
through to more nutritious and safe food on plates. We believe that 
improving the open availability , use and enrichment of data, and 
meaning ful engagement with stakeholders will enable this vision. We 
observe that the agriculture and food sector currently suffer from 
information asymmetries and closed data practices that limits 
progress, value generation and the fair distribution of resources .  
To reverse these information asymmetries and to contribute to more equitable 
outcomes, GODAN focuses its activities on delivering a range of ‘intermediate - 
ids.ac.uk  Working  Paper  Volume 202 1 Numb er 545  
Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition: A Literature Review and Proposed Conceptual 
Framework  14 
 
 
 level impacts’ that include improved interoperability, increased innovation, 
transparency and accou ntability, new business creation, and improved service 
delivery. Also targeted are more accessible  information products, data -driven 
decision -making, and increased access to data by disadvantaged 
communities . The GODAN vision also states, ‘We will proactiv ely seek to 
address gender balance in our engagement ’.  
Evidence of progress against GODAN objectives is reviewed in a later section 
but first, in order to situate ODAN in its broader context , the next section reviews 
the wider open data literature and builds a conceptual framework for analysing 
open data for agriculture and nutrition .

Framework  15 
 
 
 4. Barriers to open data use  
In Section 2, we defined open data as ‘data that can be  freely  accessed, used, 
modified, and shared  by anyone  for any purpose’. However, not everyone has 
equal opportunity to freely access, use, modify or share open data. Individuals 
have different endowments ; they operate in different political and regulatory 
contexts ; and they experie nce a range of different barriers to accessing, using, 
modifying, and sharing open data. This section reviews the existing literature to 
produce a conceptual framework for analysing the barriers that shape unequal 
access and use of open data.  
Inequality of ability to make practical use of open data led early practitioners and 
researchers to pose critical questions . ‘Open to whom?’  was one such question.  
Gurstein (2011) was among those who argued that the publishing of open data 
was not in itsel f a development outcome and that it could lead to more inequality 
rather than less. In his paper ‘Open data: Empowering the empowered or 
effective data use for everyone?’ , Gurstein argued that the primary impact of 
publishing open data is to empower those who are already advantaged in terms 
of their access to the digital infrastructure, skills and capacity necessary to 
exploit such data , leading to the further empowerment and enrichment of the 
already privileged. Rumbul (2015)  has documented how urban men a re over -
represented among users of digital governance technologies, and Davies and 
Perini (2016) have noted that open data use is similarly skewed towards middle 
class and well -educated users. Th ese findings echo others from a wider review 
of the digital d evelopment literature, which found that the use of digital 
technologies often reflects, reproduces and amplifies existing patterns of 
(dis)advantage along lines including gender, ethnicity  and caste/class 
(Hernandez and Roberts 2018). Gurstein (2003) argued that to ensure equitable 
access and effective use of open data , adequate attention would need to be paid 
to building awareness  of open data and digital literacy abilities among excluded 
communities. The next sections focus attention on how this can be achieved in 
practice.  
4.1 Publishing, interpretation and use  
Pawelke et al. (2017) have argued that it is useful to break down open data into 
three related processes: (i) open data publishing ; (ii) intermediaries converting 
open data to actionable information ; and (iii) citizens, government officials, and 
other stakeholders using open data to further their goals (Pawelke et al.  2017) . 
To some extent this mirrors Gurstein’s earlier (2011) three -part model for 
analysing open data: (a) ac cess, (b) interpretation, and (c) use. These tripartite 
approaches are illustrated in Figure 4.1. In Gurstein’s model the first ‘access’  
ids.ac.uk  Working  Paper  Volume 202 1 Numb er 545  
Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition: A Literature Review and Proposed Conceptual 
Framework  16 
 
 
 phase is concerned with the supply -side issues necessary to make open data 
available from the outset . In this first pha se decisions about publishing data in 
specific formats or standards , and the language and location of publication can 
create  unequal access  by making data only open to some people with specific 
linguistic or technical skills. Gurstein argued that a second phase of 
‘interpretation’ was often necessary to help people make meaning of open data 
and clarify its relevance to their priorities and goals. Intermediaries are often 
necessary to make open data meaningful, accessible, and practically ‘actionable’ 
by end  users. In the third phase, Gurstein focuses on the often neglected 
demand -side issues of people’s ability to make ‘effective use’ of open data, 
where effective use is defined as a person’s ability to apply open data to 
accomplish their development goals ( Gurstein 2003). Put otherwise, if open data 
efforts focus only on supply -side issues they risk benefiting already privileged 
groups , so – if equitable outcomes are desired – it is essential to invest in 
demand -side activities to build the capacity of less privileged groups to make 
effective use of open data.

Source: Authors’ own  
The analytical models of both Gurstein (2011) and Pawelke et al. (2017) are 
valuable in visualising  the three functional phases of making open  data 
available, actionable and applied . Gurstein’s approach is additionally 
advantageous in asking the critical questions of ‘open to whom?’, ‘who benefits ?’ 
and ‘who is left behind?’. These questions are  importa nt in any evaluation of 
whether open data is making processes more or less equitable (which is an 
element of the GODAN theory of change).  
Roberts (2017) built on Gurstein’s critical approach with his 5 ‘A’s of Technology 
Access model . The 5  ‘A’s provide a  framework for analysing a range of barriers 
that structure (dis)advantage in technology access. For example, in most 
countries there are individuals who live in rural or remote areas where there is no 
availability  of cellular or broadband connectivity so access is practically 
impossible. However, even where a technology is available , there usually exists 
 
ids.ac.uk  Working  Paper  Volume 202 1 Numb er 545  
Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition: A Literature Review and Proposed Conceptual 
Framework  17 
 
 
 a smaller group for whom affordability is the key barrier to access. A person 
with little or no disposable income is less able to afford internet connecti vity than 
a relatively wealthy neighbour. Among those for whom the internet is both 
available and affordable, a lack of awareness  can be a third barrier to access. 
Awareness -raising activities are generally necessary to create visibility of a new 
open data  service as well as its practical relevance to people ’s lives and goals. 
Even when awareness exists , a lack of abilities  such as digital literacy skills may 
be a barrier to access. Finally, even for those with the necessary availability, 
affordability, awa reness and abilities, accessibility  can be a barrier because the 
user interface is unavailable in a local language, lacks adaptations for people 
with visual impairments, or lacks content relevant to local priorities and concerns. 
As depicted in Figure 4.2 , the 5  ‘A’s can be conceived of as a series of 
concentric barriers to technology access and use (Roberts 2017).  
Figure 4.2 The 5  ‘A’s of technology access  
Source: Roberts (2017)  
Roberts and Hernandez (2019) added a sixth ‘A’: agency . Agency is the 
capacity to act in the world in pursuit of your goals (Sen 1999). Empowerment 
can be measured as increases in agency (Ibrahim and Alkire 2007). Sometimes 
powerful social norms result in individuals lacking the agency to make effective 
use o f a technology in their lives. For example, in some places people are 
socialised to believe that using mobile phones is inappropriate for respectable 
women or that the internet is only suitable for male / upper caste / university -
educated people. Open data  organisations often seek to empower people to 
achieve their goals by increasing the supply and effective use of open data. 
From this perspective , the open data movement is centrally about enhancing the 
agency of individuals or groups. Doing so requires mo re than the supply -side 
provision of data and must include the demand -side increase of abilities and 
agency. Unless abilities and agency are increased , the benefits of open data will 
accrue disproportionately to the already privileged and advantaged.

Sche matically we find it useful to overlay the barriers of the 6  ‘A’s onto the three -
part process model (see Figure 4.3) in order to foreground how different barriers 
to technology access are encountered at different points in the open data 
process.  
Figure 4.3 Three  phases of open data and barriers 
to access – the 6 ‘A’s  
Source: Authors’ own  
The barriers of availability  and affordability  relate primarily (though not 
exclusively) to the supply -side functions of open data organisations. This 
includes work to increase the supply of open data by working with governments 
to make their data open, interoperable, machine readable and so on . By getting 
data suppliers to make their data freely available in w ays that conform to FAIR 
principles , open data organisations aim to reduce the cost barriers to open data 
access.  
The burden of awareness -raising  and accessibility  adaptation falls primarily to 
intermediary  organisations in the open data ecosystem. This wo rk includes 
making the existence of open data known, helping groups to interpret the 
relevance of open data to the goals of specific groups, and creating translations 
and visualisation of open data to make it actionable. This need for intermediaries 
to mak e open data actionable raises the critical question of ‘ open to whom ?’ and 
the wider issues of accessibility. If open data is to be accessible to indigenous 
people, it must be published in their languages. To be relevant to all parts of the 
community, open  data must provide content on subjects that are the priorities 
and goals of, for example, black and minority ethnic groups. And if open data is 
to be used by the 15  per cent  of the population who are visually impaired or 
those who are print -illiterate, it must be published with their accessibility  in 
mind. Leaving no one behind in the open data movement will require an 
increasing focus on accessibility if existing exclusions and disadvantages are not 
to be reinforced by open data.

 Building the abilities  and agency  of marginalised actors in the open data 
ecosystem is core to activities on the demand -side. The two are often linked 
because building people’s practical skills and competencies is one effective way 
to boost their self -efficacy and sense of agency ( Bandura 1995). If the efforts of 
the open data movement were to end with the successful production of 
actionable open data, we would expect the majority of the benefits to accrue to 
organisations already privileged with the most capital, expertise and tech nical 
capabilities (Gurstein 2011). Open data initiatives can avoid the risk of reflecting, 
reproducing and amplifying existing (dis)advantage by including measures to 
increase availability and affordability, improve awareness and accessibility, and 
enhanc e the abilities and agency of under -represented and marginalised groups 
to make effective use of open data.  
4.2 The 6 ‘A’s of open data for development  
The next sections review the open data literature through the conceptual lens 
developed above and illustrate d in Figure 4.3.  
Availability:  Increasing the supply -side availability of open data is a stated 
objective of many organisations in the open data movement including GODAN. 
Obstacles to increasing the availability of open data can be political, economic, 
social, or technical, and will vary dynamically over time and space. Barriers may 
include a lack of political will, the expense of migrating to open data, the inertia of 
entrenched operating practices, or the clash of incompatible file formats. These 
situate d political, economic, social and technical (PEST) factors are ‘key not only 
in understanding how open data influences change but also with regard to 
understanding barriers and opportunities that characterise the landscape’ 
(Lokers, Berdou and Ayala 2019: 5–6).  
In some contexts, the political will may not exist to publish data to combat 
government corruption. Research by the Web Foundation (2017: 18) found that 
‘Open data portals do not contain the data people really want (e.g. data on 
budget, spending, co ntracting and company registers). These datasets tend to 
be highly opaque and are often the least open’ . In countries such as Ethiopia, a 
lack of political will to open government data can be combined with poor internet 
infrastructure and a tendency of government to frequently shut  down the internet 
for political reasons  (Netblocks 2019) . However, sometimes there is simply no 
availability of data to open (e.g. no land title data exists in any format for a 
region). It is important to recognise  that availability is not binary . Sometimes it is 
available but in low quality: one of the Philippines’ foremost open data 
professionals quipped that the very slow connection speeds available at his 
home meant that he has plenty of time to go and boil his rice while waiting for a 
single data  set to download (Roberts and Hernandez 2017).   
ids.ac.uk  Working  Paper  Volume 202 1 Numb er 545  
Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition: A Literature Review and Proposed Conceptual 
Framework  20 
 
 
 Affordability:  Digital devices and data connectivity come at a cost. The process 
of downloading, processing and analysing data carries financial, time, and 
opportunity cost s. The cost of computers, internet connectivity, and the time of 
data analysts and staff mean that different organisations have different capacity 
to acquire, analyse, and apply open data. Affordability issues create inequities 
between different government s, between corporations and citizens, and between 
genders. Governments may find it unaffordable to reorganise data collection, 
update storage and sharing protocols, or to properly maintain and keep open 
data portals up to date (Davies et al.  2019) . Multinational companies are less 
likely to experience affordability barriers when compared to small businesses or 
civil society organisations. Women’s organisations may lack th e necessary 
resources to play an active role in the open data ecosystem or to make effective 
use of open data in their organisations (Feminist Open Government 2019) . 
Developing open data skills and building influence within the open data 
movement requires the expenditure of significant amounts of ‘free time’, a 
resource that wo men lack relative to men due to the unequal burden of childcare, 
cooking and cleaning (Brandusescu and Nwakanma 2019; Feminist Open 
Government 2019) . 
Awareness : In order for data to be useful, potential users need to be aware of 
its existence, its importance and potential applications, and its relevan ce to their 
goals and priorities. Zuiderwijk et al. (2015)  found that lack of awareness about 
the usefulness and applicability of open data to improve work and life leads to 
available open data being underutilised. The State of Open Data  report  (Figshare 
and Digital Science 2019)  recently found that awareness o f open data is still low 
even within academic circles and among frequent data sharers, with the majority 
unaware of open data principles or licen sing requirements. Low levels of 
awareness also exist within civil society with the Feminist Open Government 
(2019)  study finding that women’s organisations tend to l ack awareness of open 
data. Organisations advocating the increased supply and use of open data often 
dedicate significant resources to raising awareness both on the supply -side, 
encouraging the publication of open data , and on the demand -side, encouraging 
use. Sometimes those with awareness of the value of open data (e.g. librarians) 
lack the social power to leverage change. Increasing the agency of open data 
‘champions’ to enhance effective use has been identified as a potential method 
to increase awarenes s (Zuiderwijk et al.  2015) . 
Accessibility:  Intermediary organisations fulfil multiple roles in the open data 
movement, including help with the interpretation and translation of open data into 
actionable formats readily accessible by users. Research by the Web 
Foundation found that much of the data  that is made open is only available in 
inaccessible formats, where only ‘7% of government datasets across 115 
countries meet all requirements to be considered open data ’ (2017: 12) . In other 
cases  open data may exist in accessible technical formats but not in indigenous  
ids.ac.uk  Working  Paper  Volume 202 1 Numb er 545  
Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition: A Literature Review and Proposed Conceptual 
Framework  21 
 
 
 languages, may lack locally  relevant content, or be produced in formats that are 
not accessible to people with visual impairments or by those who are print -
illiterate. Ding, Wald an d Wills (2014) carried out a survey of open accessibility 
data which could benefit people with accessibility needs, but such work remains 
peripheral to the mainstream to date.  
Abilities: Demand -side interventions in open data often include efforts to build  
skills to access and apply online data  sets to meet specific goals. The abilities 
required are most often a combination of digital literacies and sector -specific 
expertise, neither of which are evenly spread across populations. While 
government and corpor ations may be able to purchase these skillsets, they can 
present a formidable barrier to small businesses, civil society organisations, or 
disadvantaged individuals wishing to use open data. Open data  sets can vary in 
quality and low levels of user -friendl y design have also been identified as a 
barrier to open data uptake (Zuiderwijk et al.  2015) . Achieving increased supply 
and use of open data requires new abilities among open data actors , not just to 
access data but to develop new services, tools and business models (Berdou 
et al. 2017). These ability barriers have resulted in a role for intermediary 
organisations to help interpret and make open data actionable by those who do 
not have specialist technical or sectoral abilities (Gurstein 2011; Zuiderwijk et al.  
2015; Davies and Perini 2016; Lokers et al.  2019; Berdou and Ayala 2019) .  
Agenc y: Increasing  the supply of material  resources like data, devices and 
digital skills can help build a person’s agency, but agency is also importantly 
about a person’s psychological  resources , including self -confidence and self -
efficacy (Roberts 2015). Two people with p recisely the same measurable skills 
and resources may have very different beliefs about their ability to accomplish 
goals (Bandura 1995). Bandura’s body of research establish ed that a person 
with an elevated sense of their own ability and entitlement is more likely to 
succeed than an equally talented or able person who has a low sense of their 
ability and entitlement. This is true for members of all demographic groups but 
when i nterventions aim to improve equity of outcomes, it is especially important 
for groups who have experienced persistent disadvantage or deprivation and 
who, as a result, have revised downwards their expectations and beliefs about 
what they are capable of ach ieving or deserve (Sen 1999).

Framework  22 
 
 
 5. Gender barriers to open data  
Gender inequalities pervade the technology sector in general, and the open data 
movement is no exception. Data is gender -biased (Criado -Perez 2019), is rarely 
gender -disaggregated ( Buvinic et al.  2014), and large gender data gaps exist. 
Brandusescu and Nwakanma argue convincingly that ‘as long as gender data 
gaps persist, any open datasets created based on raw data that does not 
adequately represent women will have limited potential to support trans formative 
action on gender equity’  (2019: 194) . Women are also under -represented as 
users of the internet, and of open data in particular. Web Foundation (2017) 
research found that women are 20  per cent  less likely to use the internet to seek 
out informati on; are less likely to be consulted on the design of data policies and 
initiatives; and are under -represented among the ranks of data scientists. 
Multiple regression analyses from a study of open data usage in India showed 
that women are less likely to use  open data sets than men and that men are 
more likely to use open data for professional purposes (Saxena and Janssen 
2017) . 
Women are under -represented as participants and employees in the open data 
movement, especially in senior positions (Brandusescu and Nwakanma 2 019), 
just as they are in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) in 
general (UNESCO 2017). In the open data sector women are less likely to be 
represented in ‘leadership in open data organisations, leading to a gender bias in 
data collecti on and publication’ (Brandusescu and Nwakanma 2019: 291) . These 
gendered social norms are internalised and can negatively affect women’s 
agency to enter and play active roles as producers and users of technology.  
Not all women are equally (dis)advantaged. Women from black an d minority 
ethnic communities and women living with disabilities experience overlapping 
forms of disadvantage (Crenshaw 1989). In their study, the Web Foundation 
(2017: 20) noted that ‘groups with lower income and/or less political power tend 
to be exclude d from consultation and decision -making processes around open 
data, frequently lack internet connectivity and the skills to access open data, and 
may also be less visible in the data in itself ’. The Web Foundation ( ibid.) also 
found that ‘ few open data initiatives actively promote in clusion and equity’. As a 
result, unless specific and sustained measures are taken, the open data sector 
risks reproducing and potentially amplifying existing gender and intersectional 
inequalities. Two recent publications have argued that gender equity ne eds to be 
the next frontier in open data (Brandusescu and Nwakanma 2019; Davies et al.  
2019) . 
Research has shown that women and girls are significantly less likely to have 
access to digital devices a nd internet connectivity , and are more likely to only  
ids.ac.uk  Working  Paper  Volume 202 1 Numb er 545  
Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition: A Literature Review and Proposed Conceptual 
Framework  23 
 
 
 have shared access compared to boys and men (Davies et al.  2019; Girl Effect 
2018) . Moreover, women in the global South tend only to have a ccess to the 
internet through mobile phones, but most open data applications and tools are 
not optimised for mobile phones (Brandusescu and Nwakanma 2019) . Women 
are more likely to lack the capacity to contribute to and use data (Brandusescu 
and Nwakanma 2019) . We know that women are under -represented in Open 
Government Partnership action plan co nsultations and that gender 
considerations rarely feature in national action plan commitments (Feminist 
Open Government 2019) . As a result, issues which women find particularly 
important, including economic empowerment, political leadership, and violence 
against women, remain largely absent from Open Government Partnership 
action plans (Feminist Open Government 2019: 9) .  
These g ender barriers to open data are particularly relevant for the purposes of 
this literature review as the GODAN vision statement specifically targets 
agriculture and nutrition systems that are more equitable (by gender and 
socioeconomic status) and GODAN’s t heory of change commits to proactively 
seek to address gender imbalance in its engagements ( Carolan 201 6). 
5.1 Power structures  
The previous  sections reviewed a range of conceptual approaches to analysing 
open data and used them to apply a critical lens to the  existing open data 
literature. We found the three -phase approaches of Pawelke et al. (2017) and 
Gurstein (2011) to be useful as a way of understanding supply -side activities to 
increase the publication of open data, the intermediation  of organisations to 
make open data actionable, and demand -side activities to increase the effective 
use and application of open data. This three -part approach was complemented 
by the 5  ‘A’s of technology access and required the addition of a sixth ‘A’ to 
enable open data acce ssibility by those with disabilities or speaking indigenous 
languages. Finally, following McGee and Edwards (2016) and Lokers et al.  
(2019) , we found it necessary to situate the open data value chain within the 
wider context of political, economic, social,  and technical factors that shape open 
data for development, and which open data for development initiatives often 
seek to shape (hence the two -way arrows below). Together these elements 
provide us with a conceptual framework for analysing the structural c ontext of 
technology access ( the SCOTA Framework), which is illustrated in Figure 5.1.

Framework  24

(SCOTA) framework

We find this approach particularly appropriate for evaluating the performance of 
GODAN because its logframe and theory of change speak directly of ‘increasing 
the supply’ of open data, empowering ecosystem intermediaries, and ‘increasing 
the use’ of open d ata. GODAN objectives also explicitly include making open 
data more available and affordable , and their activities specifically include raising 
awareness and enhancing abilities.   
The next sections use this framework to review the literature on open data f or 
agriculture and nutrition (ODAN)  as well as GODAN more specifically.

 6. Open Data for Agriculture and 
Nutrition  
Governments, agribusiness, universities, and individual farmers are increasingly 
producers and consumers of data to improve yields, innovation,  and income. 
Open data holds significant potential for improved environmental, economic and 
development outcomes. However, asymmetries of power, information and 
resources present potential barriers to equitable outcomes. A number of 
organisations have emer ged to strengthen the ODAN ecosystem and increase 
the supply of open data for development.  
The agriculture and nutrition sector s present  specific challenges for the 
promotion of open data due to the volume and diversity of stakeholders . The 
ODAN ecosystem  is composed of organisations of farmers, private sector 
companies, civil society organisations, governments, and multilateral agencies. It 
includes many specialist groups including agronomists, meteorologists, data  
scientists, lawyers, land  rights activist s, and academics. GODAN is one of 
several global networks that advocate for open data in agriculture and nutrition . 
The agricultural and nutrition sectors are composed of many inter -related sub -
sectors and the se inter-connect with many other sectors ( e.g. food systems, 
ecology, nutrition, human health, the environment). To make matters even more 
complex, each related sector and sub -sector is composed of value chains with 
many  – sometimes thousands  – of diverse stakeholders, both internal (e.g. 
farmers,  producer groups, input suppliers, traders, processors, exporters, etc .) 
and external (e.g. regulators) , who are  generating different data types, formats, 
and ontologies and who themselves have differing data needs ( Musker et al. 
2018). 
Key organisations i n the open data for agriculture and nutrition ecosystem 
include: the  Research Data Alliance (RDA) ;11 the Global Forum for Agricultural 
Research ;12 Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data ;13 AgriCord ;14 
 
11  The Research Data Alliance has more than 200 members and seeks ‘to promote good practice in the 
research domain’. The Research Data Alliance host s the Agricultural Data Interest Group (IGAD) .  
12  The Global Forum for Agricultural Research  is an open and volunt ary multi -stakeholder agri -food 
research and innovation forum with more than 600 partner organisations .  
13  The Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data  is a multi -stakeholder network of more than 
150 data champions harnessing the data revolutio n for sustainable development, including ODAN 
members such as the Food and Agriculture Organization  and GODAN . 
14  AgriCord is a global alliance of more than 200 farmer organisations from more than 50 developing 
countries that are part of the Farmers Fighti ng Poverty programme.  It partners with CTA and others to 
provide support , seeking to strengthen farmer organisation s’ use of data and ICT .

 and Presidents United to Solve Hunger15 (Schaap  et al.  2019). Musker et al.  
(2018) mapped the different kinds of actors relevant to open data in agriculture 
and nutrition and indicated their relationships to one another (see Figure 6.1). 
Figure 6.1 Agricultural open data actors and their 
relationships

Governments are key actors in the supply side  of opening agriculture and 
nutrition data because they have the power to increase the availability  of open 
data sets such as meteorological, land registry, and nutrition data. The US and 
the UK were early adopters of open data in agriculture. The availabi lity of open 
 
15  Presidents United to Solve Hunger  is a consortium of  110-plus universities from around the world that 
have the collective mission to end hunger and poverty, both locally and globally. In partnership with 
GODAN, the consortium  publishes tools and materials that help universities  to open  up their data.  
 
ids.ac.uk  Working  Paper  Volume 202 1 Numb er 545  
Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition: A Literature Review and Proposed Conceptual 
Framework  27 
 
 
 weather data in the U S and the UK generated substantial innovation resulting in 
economic and social impact through the creation of a multi -million dollar industry 
of weather tools and information products. Availability of real -time open weathe r 
data has enabled some farmers to improve their yields (Mey et al.  2019). 
GODAN has been active on the supply side encouraging government to publish 
open data sets. GODAN found that governments are often reluctant to open up 
agricultural and nutrition dat a for political reasons. For example, in Ethiopia , the 
ability of private companies to develop applications and tools using weather data 
is limited by a law that states that only the government is allowed to broadcast 
localised weather information (Lokers et al.  2019). Tanzania recently introduced 
and revoked a law that made it illegal for anyone to publish data that invalidates 
or questions government statistics (Lokers et al.  2019). There may be economic 
reasons to keep land data sets closed in order make  it easier to sell off plots of 
land to foreign investors (Mey, Miguel Ayala and Lokers 2018). In fact, 70 per cent  
of land data is unregistered (Mey et al. 2018). However, in many cases , land data  
cannot be made open because land ownership has never been documented and 
the cost of land registry maintenance is unaffordable  (Lokers et al. 2019).  
Governments are important not only as producers of their own data. They are 
also key because of their power to require private sector and academic actors to 
open the ir data (Schaap et al. 2019). Governments can help to provide an 
enabling environment  for open agricultural data through the creation of  laws, 
policies, and regulation,  but also by leading a public discourse on the benefits of 
ODAN. GODAN has successfully leveraged this power by including national 
governments in the ODAN ecosystem. GODAN played a central role in 
facilitating the 2017 Nairobi Ministerial Conference on Glo bal Open Data for 
Agriculture and Nutrition at which 15 African minist ers signed  a declaration of 
commitment to publish open data and to raise awareness  around open data for 
agriculture and nutrition. The Nairobi Declaration has inspired Francophone 
countr ies to develop their own network, the Conference d’Afrique Francophone 
sur les Donn ées Ouvertes (CAFDO) (Schaap et al. 2019). GODAN has 
published a guide to opening data for agriculture to help other countries to join 
the movement (Open Data Charter and GO DAN 2018). This is clear evidence of 
GODAN progress against its logframe objective ‘to empower the ecosystem  by 
creating an overarching enabling environment for open data for agriculture and 
nutrition’.  
Standard -setting has been identified as essential supply-side activity to improve 
interoperability and so increase open data availability  and use. The many sub -
fields of agriculture and other related fields each have their own data standards. 
However, these standards tend not to be interoperable with one an other , making 
it difficult for users to combine data  sets within and across value chains to garner 
insights (Schaap et al. 2019). GODAN Action  mapped agricultural standards and 
found a low level of interoperability (Schaap et al.  2019). For example, GODAN  
ids.ac.uk  Working  Paper  Volume 202 1 Numb er 545  
Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition: A Literature Review and Proposed Conceptual 
Framework  28 
 
 
 has found that nutrition data is often labelled differently by different organisations 
using different categories for regions and sub -regions, and different terms to 
describe nutritional status (Berdou and Lokers 2019; Lokers et al. 2019). 
GODAN Action fou nd that only 56  per cent  of agri -food data standards are 
machine -readable ; just 21  per cent  are available under an open licen ce; and  
16 per cent  are not even available online (Pesce et al. 2018; Schaap et al.  2019). 
GODAN is actively working on this important supply -side issue , seeking to 
increase the availability of open data by promoting open and interoperable 
standards through the VEST Registry in partnership with the Agricultural 
Information Management Sta ndards (AIMS) initiative. The literature review was 
unable to identify evidence of the extent to which this has been accomplished or 
to what extent gains that have been made were attributable to GODAN activities.  
Farmers are at the centre of the ODAN ecos ystem, as illustrated above in 
Figure  6.1. This includes global agribusinesses down to individual smallholders. 
GODAN has multinational agribusiness companies, including Syngenta, among 
its members. A power imbalance exists between actors with regard to da ta 
availability and affordability  (Ferris and Rahman 2017). Organisations are able to 
interpret and apply data for agriculture and nutrition in proportion to their capital, 
connectivity and capacity. This has led to new ethical concerns about who owns 
farm data and who profits from its aggregation and sale , as well as concerns 
about the lack of transparency about how data is ultimately used by more 
powerful actors ( ibid.). Given the profit motive of private companies, some of 
their data  sets are seen as com mercial assets and are thus not opened up, even 
when they hold the potential to improve sustainable development outcomes 
(Schaap et al.  2019). Although many agribusiness companies in the private 
sector lack transparency and have shown minimal interest in o pening their data, 
some are beginning to see opening data as part of maintaining a ‘licen ce to 
operate’. Syngenta is one company that has made open data a centrepiece of its 
transparency strategy (Schaap et al.  2019).  
Farmers and farm machinery increasingl y generate primary agricultural data that 
can potentially be used to improve yields and profits. Although this data may be 
open and freely available, an  affordability  barrier often remains for smallholder 
farmers who lack the means to collect or use such data. ‘Financial cost [is] the 
most common challenge mentioned by GODAN partners when working towards 
open data’ (Musker et al.  2018: 8). Private sector companies are less likely to 
face an affordability barrier than smallholders who may have to depend on 
intermediaries (Gurstein 2011). Intermediary organisations from government, 
the private sector, universities, or NGOs , have emerged to help farmers interpret 
and apply open data. Intermediaries ‘develop portals, apps, and tools that allow 
farmers to benefit  from data on a range of topics, such as weather, infestations, or 
soil quality, that would otherwise be unavailable to them’ (Schaap et al. 2019: 40) . 
Intermediaries have also piloted accessibility solutions to overcome barriers of  
ids.ac.uk  Working  Paper  Volume 202 1 Numb er 545  
Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition: A Literature Review and Proposed Conceptual 
Framework  29 
 
 
 language and literacies . Communicating open data through Interactive Voice 
Response (IVR) has been proposed as a potential solution but has been found 
to be expensive for farmers and service providers (Ferris and Rahman 2017). 
Universities and academics are often intermediaries and play active roles in 
producing open agriculture and nutrition data ;16 or take part in data discovery 
networks like the RDA and the Interest Group on Agricultural Data (IGAD) 
(Schaap et al.  2019). Funders of agricultural research are increasingly requiring 
that data collected during projects they fund is made public, including USAID and 
the Gates Foundation ( ibid.).  
Ferris and Rahman (2017) found that farmers often lack awareness of open da ta 
and its potential benefits , and that this limits its uptake once data is published 
openly. Lokers et al.  (2019) found that ODAN initiatives are often stymied by low 
levels of awareness and understanding about the existence of open data and its 
relevance  for agriculture and nutrition. GODAN and intermediary ODAN 
organisations have had significant success in raising  high-level awareness  about 
the potential of open data for agriculture and nutrition. However, at the lower 
level of marginalised groups, the l iterature review was unable to find independent 
evidence of GODAN’s intermediate -level objective of ‘increasing access to open 
data in disadvantaged constituencies’. A Google Scholar search of articles with 
‘open data’ and ‘agriculture’ in the title return ed only 49 results, many of which 
were technical concept notes for proposed future open data solutions; were 
about something other than open data; or was GODAN -commissioned research, 
or reference to GODAN -convened events or workshops. A search for publishe d 
material with ‘open data’ and ‘nutrition’ in the title returned only 20 results with 
similar drawbacks. This echoes Davies and Perini’s (2016) findings about open 
data research more widely, that although the literature is expanding , there is very 
little sustained empirical work on the intermediate outcomes or development 
impacts of open data. The open data for agriculture and nutrition research that 
does exist is focused primarily on supply -side potentials, problems, and policy 
alternatives rather than ev aluation of outcomes. This means that there is no 
substantial evidence base to support claims of the efficacy of open data for 
agriculture and nutrition pro -poor outcomes.  
GODAN does publish its own series of ‘impact narratives’, which are very 
effective in communicating potential, but which cannot be considered to be 
independent evidence of achievement against its intermediate high -level 
impacts. GODAN Action’s nutrition impact narratives have shown how open data 
collated by intermediaries  like the Global  Nutrition Report could be  interpreted 
and repurposed to fit regional and local needs through the African Nutrition 
Scorecard to support local awareness -raising and advocacy for data -based 
decision -making on policies, programmes, and targeted interventions  that meet

 local demands (Lokers et al.  2019) . This outcome was the result of Global 
Nutrition Report shifting its focus from only producing a document with da ta 
contained within , to becoming a ‘living repository’ and open data publisher by 
also making its metadata and data available openly.  
GODAN Action’s Open Land Data narratives illustrate how the intermediary 
organisation Land Portal  was able to increase the  quality,  accessibility , 
interoperability, and global visibility and use of data from Land Conflict Watch, a 
local data journalism project in India (Lokers et al.  2019) . Another land impact 
narrative published by GODAN Action illustrates how the intermediary 
organisation Open Development Cambodia was able to coordinate many actors 
from civil society that are collecting land data on land concessions to overcome 
issues of conflicting and inconsistent data , through aggregating and cleaning 
data using open data principles . Lokers et al.  (2019: 46) found that  through  ‘a 
unified basis and voice for the civil society , coupled with international media 
coverage and pressure, the government postponed the grant of land 
concessions to the private sector and hastened granting social land concessions 
to the poor’.  
Intermediary  organisations often play a key role in helping to interpret and 
translate open data for agriculture and nutrition in various ways. The format in 
which open data is available is important in enabling effective use. Evidence 
from the real -time data for development field has shown that the likelihood of 
data usage is increased if it is shared in multiple formats tailored to the needs 
and abilities  of different user groups (Barnett and Edwards 2014). Similar 
findings have been recorded in the open data for nutrition literature. Rather than 
over-reliance on digital formats , synthesi sing findings from open data may be 
more appropriate for some audiences (Lokers et al.  2019) ; the African Scorecard 
on Nutrition found that accessibility  was improved through the provision of hard -
copy reports . 
GODAN’s own research  found that the programme struggles to ensure that open 
data benefits farmers (Musker et al.  2018). It is widely accepted that smallholder 
farmers tend to have relatively little capacity to exploit data and that the gap in 
abilities and agency is greater i n low -income countries, in rural areas, and for 
women (Schaap et al.  2019). This is particularly important in the areas of ODAN 
because making effective use of open data for agriculture and nutrition often 
requires domain -specific expertise as well as digi tal and data literacies. For 
example, nutrition data includes scientific classifications and measurements that 
may not be in the general lexicon. Similarly, because weather data is technical 
and scientific in nature, using it in its raw form requires scien tific meteorological 
expertise (Lokers et al.  2019). We were unable to find independent research 
literature that provid es evidence of measurable progress in demand -side 
initiatives to build the abilities  and agency of marginalised groups to make

Framework  31 
 
 
 effective use of open data for agricultural and nutrition. GODAN and GODAN 
Action have run many training workshops and its online e -learning course has 
had an impressive 4,448 participants  (Janssen 2019) . However, people who are 
able to participate in online trainin g programmes have levels of connectivity, 
digital literacy and language skills that are not typical in marginalised 
communities.  
Withholding agency  from open data programmes can sometimes be strategic on 
the part of citizens. Even when data is open and av ailable, some people or 
groups may have reason not to trust data coming from government or see no 
probable benefit from providing it (Lokers et al.  2019). Citizens who mistrust 
powerful actors may withhold their agency  and not engage in open data 
initiativ es. For example, local land data -holders may choose to keep their data 
closed if they fear that sharing it with government might lead to their land title 
being usurped rather than legitimised (Mey et al.  2018). These fears are not 
unfounded. An early land registration digiti sation project in Bangalore found that 
digitisation efforts led to increased corruption and facilitated the acquisition of 
settled but unregistered land by powerful private companies (Benjamin, 
Bhuvaneswari and Rajan 2007) , amplifying existing patterns of (dis)advantage.  
The need to address gender  inequalities and under -representation in open data 
has only recently begun to receive sufficient attention (Feminist Open 
Government 2019). Berdou and Lokers (2019) found that nutr itional data tends 
not to be sufficiently disaggregated by gender and other demographics , making it 
more difficult to use data to advocate for the needs of women or develop policies 
and solutions that meet their needs. GODAN explicitly recognised the probl ems 
of gender data bias and the under -representation of women in ODAN when it 
wrote its gender mainstreaming policy in 2016  (GODAN 2016) . A number of 
commitments were made in the gender mainstreaming policy including to build a 
diverse organisation and to integrat e gender issues into the theory of change 
and logframe. However, t he theory of change and logframe have not been 
updated  to reflect these commitments. Although the GODAN theory of change 
mentions gender equity as an objective, the log frame lists no  gender activities 
and contains no pathway activities designed to redress the gender inequities that 
GODAN identified in its gender mainstreaming policy. Although GODAN has 
contributed significantly to the evidence base on ODAN, it has not focused 
research  attention on the intersection between gender and open data for 
agriculture and nutrition.  
GODAN is playing a significant role in producing an evidence base for open data 
in agriculture and nutrition. However, there is little independent empirical or peer -
reviewed literature measuring the impact of ODAN activities. Most of the 
evidence that does exist was produced by GODAN (Berdou et al.  2017; Berdou 
and Lokers 2019; Mey et al.  2019, 2018). Much of that evidence takes the form  
ids.ac.uk  Working  Paper  Volume 202 1 Numb er 545

Framework  32 
 
 
 of narratives of initiatives b y GODAN partners and often does not make clear 
what role  – if any  – GODAN  played in convening, equipping, or empowering the 
actors in the narratives. GODAN seems to play a key role but the existing 
literature does not detail its extent in a way that helps to inform a performance 
review.

 7. Conclusions and future issues in 
ODAN  
Based on our review of the existing literature, GODAN appears to have made 
substantial progress in achieving its supply -side objectives of expanding the 
quantity of organisations signed  up to open data principles, and has played a 
central role in securing the increase in availability  of open data for agriculture and 
nutrition. GODAN has been successful in creating high-level awareness  and 
policy commitments that have contributed to gener ating political will and an 
enabling environment  for open data in agriculture and nutrition. GODAN has also 
produced or contributed to a range of highly valuable tools, policy engagements, 
and research papers that have further advanced its objectives. GODA N 
members have played a range of influential intermediary  roles , raising 
awareness  and assisting others to interpret and apply open data.  
This success is inevitably uneven across  countries as well as among 
stakeholders within countries. There is less evidence of farm-level awareness,  
especially among rural smallholders, or of demand -side progress more generally. 
We found no evidence of sustained or systematic work to address the da ta 
accessibility  needs of speakers of indigenous languages, print -illiterate 
stakeholders, or people living with disabilities. The GODAN theory of change and 
logframe lack activities or a planned pathway of change to address gender 
diversity and the under -representation of women in open data.  
The relative lack of attention to demand -side factors, including building the 
abilities and agency  of marginalised groups, may mean that GODAN operational 
objectives are met  but with the unintended consequence that the  organisations 
most empowered to exploit open data could be multinational agribusiness 
corporations.  
The examples of Ethiopia, Tanzania and the US illustrate the point that initial 
gains in securing high -level support for open data can also be reversed whe n 
more authoritarian governments close civic space. We were unable to access 
data on GODAN’s membership in an open and accessible FAIR format. The 
GODAN website lists members’ logos but this data is not readily downloadable 
or searchable.

 7.1 Gaps in the existing research literature  
The majority of the research to date has been focused on supply -side 
mechanisms.  
There has been no independent evaluation of who benefits or who is being left 
behind in open agriculture and nutrition data.  
There has been no in dependent evaluation of gender or diversity in ODAN.  
There has been no independent evaluation of the extent of the international 
development impacts of open data for agriculture and nutrition.  
The existing research on open data for agriculture and nutritio n is over -reliant on 
GODAN actors and open data insiders. This creates bias in the data.  
7.2 Recommendations  
ODAN organisations should increase the emphasis paid to demand -side and 
intermediary initiatives in order to ensure that marginalised communities are n ot 
left behind in open data initiatives.  
Funders should commission a strategic review of ODAN that encompasses the 
structural factors shaping the process of ODAN and which pays attention to 
intermediary and demand -side processes. The SCOTA Framework may p rovide 
a useful starting point for such a review.  
Research commissioners should prioritise independent research that addresses 
the gaps identified in the existing literature to determine who benefits most from 
ODAN , and who is being left behind in open ag riculture and nutrition data.
