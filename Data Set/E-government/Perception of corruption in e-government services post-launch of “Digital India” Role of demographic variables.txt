Title:  Perception of corruption in e0government services post0launch of “Digital India”: Role of 
demographic variables  
Purpose:  The main purpose of this paper is to underline the  role of demographic variables as far 
as the perception of corruption among the Indian re spondents is concerned.  
Design/methodology/approach:  Hierarchical regression analysis is conducted to a scertain the 
role of demographic variables in line with the stud y’s objectives.   
Findings: Gender is one demographic factor which influences t he perception of corruption by 
the respondents. Other demographic factors like edu cation, marital status, professional status and 
age do not have any influence on the user perceptio n of corruption in e0government services. 
Implicitly, there are differences in the manner in which men and women perceive the prevalence 
of corruption in India. Therefore, males perceive t hat corruption has decreased in e0government 
services post0launch of “Digital India” initiative and women perceive the opposite. 
Research implications/limitations:  On the one hand, the study holds significance in th at no 
empirical investigation has been conducted which se eks to underline the impact of the “Digital 
India” initiatives on the citizen’s perception of c orruption in public services. On the other hand, 
the present research is limited in the sense that o nly demographic variables are being probed in 
the present study with a small sample.  
Originality/value:  Studies in developing countries have remained few and far between despite 
the growing concern for existence of corruption in government services. The present study seeks 
to fill the gap by underlining the role of demograp hic variables as far as the perception of 
corruption in public services is concerned in the I ndian context.    
Key words:  e0government, corruption, “Digital India”, India 
1. Introduction 
 
The call for transparency and public accountability  in administration has remained a 
major concern in developing as well as developed co untries (Oye, 2013; Singh et al., 
2010). Therefore, government innovations are being undertaken for ensuring that public 
services are delivered in a smooth and efficient ma nner. However, in societies which are 
ridden with the menace of corruption, achieving the  over0arching goals of governance is 
difficult (Foo, Wu and Chin, 2014; Krishnan, Teo an d Lim, 2013). For this purpose, 
governments have been introducing a series of innov ations to ensure that there is 
transparency in administration. Government innovati ons are conducted to ensure social 
transformation (Barrett, Sahay and Walsham, 2001; K rell, Matook and Rohde, 2016) and 
reform of administration (Walsham and Sahay, 1999).  One of these innovations is that of 
e0government by which information technology (IT) a pplications are tapped for public 
service delivery (Ndou, 2004) and to bring about ef ficiency, economy and effectiveness 
in administration (Ciborra, 2005; Zhao and Xu, 2015 ). Research has underlined that e0
government initiatives help in checking red0tape an d inefficiency in government (Cullen, 
2009). Corruption is a measure of government ineffi ciency (Asogwa, 2012; Belwal and 
Downloaded by Stephen F Austin State University At 13:12 29 January 2018 (PT)
Al0Zoubi, 2008; Ciborra, 2005; Valle0Cruz, Sandoval 0Almazan and Gil0Garcia, 2016) 
and while e0government reforms facilitate governmen ts to promote good governance 
(Ciborra and Navarra, 2005; Shim and Eom, 2008) by delivering timely, economic, 
efficient, effective and consistent services (Busse ll, 2011; Dominguez, Sanchez, and 
Alvarez, 2011); corruption in e0government services  may fail to achieve such aims. From 
a developing country’s perspective, Indian governme nt has initiated a number of 
administrative reforms with the underlying purpose of instituting a transparent 
administrative culture in the country (Pathak et al ., 2009; Singh et al., 2010). Lately, 
India launched its “Digital India” initiative with the aim of streamlining its public service 
delivery and furthering transparency in administrat ion. For the present research, we will 
underline the role of demographic variables as far as the perception of corruption in 
government services is concerned with particular re ference to the “Digital India” 
initiative. 
 
In this study, the theoretical framework is being p rovided using the institutional theory 
view. Hitherto, institutional theory has been probe d to study the public sector (Currie, 
2009). Institutional theory has also been invoked t o probe the innovation adoption and 
implementation dimensions in different contexts (De Vaujany et al., 2014). The theory 
also helps in underlining the extent to which Infor mation and Communication 
Technologies are being adapted to suit the interest s of users (Zorn, Flanagin, and 
Shoham, 2011). The fundamental basis of this theory  rests on the assumption that 
institutions adopt different practices and mechanis ms for legitimizing their authority and 
to impress upon the stakeholders the utility and su stainability of these practices and 
mechanisms (Scott, 2003). Institutional theory is b ased on a multi0level analysis with the 
involvement of a multitude of stakeholders who are impacted upon or impact the 
planning and implementation of any institutional in novation (DiMaggio and Powell, 
1983; Thelen, 1999). In the present study, the appl icability of institutional theory rests on 
the fact that “Digital India” is an “institutional”  measure which was introduced by the 
government in order to gain legitimacy and trust of  different stakeholders. In particular, 
the programme was conceived as a measure to garner support of the citizens in terms of 
reducing corruption in public service delivery.               
 
The key significance of this study lies in the fact  that while a number of studies have 
been conducted to probe the theoretical dimensions of e0government innovations (for 
instance, for instance, Anwer et al., 2016; Saxena,  2005; Sharma, Govindaluri and 
Gattoufi, 2015; Srivastava, Teo and Devaraj, 2016; Sutherland, 2014; Ziemba et al., 
2016), there are limited studies which seek to inve stigate the role of e0government 
initiatives in curbing corruption in developing cou ntries (Singh et al., 2010; Sutherland, 
2016). Besides, there has been no study which has s ought to probe the role of 
demographic factors in user perception of corruptio n in public services. This study seeks 
to cover the aforementioned lacuna keeping the over arching rubric of institutional theory 
to address the research question0“What is the role of demographic variables in user 
perception of corruption in public service delivery  in Indian context?”. 
 
The paper is organized as follows: literature on e0 government and institutional theory has

2. Literature review 
2.1  E-government 
 
E0government has been researched extensively. With the help of information and 
communication technology, governments have been mak ing transitions to e0governments 
and for the achievement of this purpose, public ser vices are being provided over the 
internet (Davison, Wagner and Ma, 2005; Hasan, 2004 ; Mistry and Jalal, 2012; Mutula 
and Mostert 2010; Naz et al., 2006; Neupane et al.,  2014; Schware and Deane, 2003). E0
governments result in improvement of quality in pub lic services (Foley and Alfonso, 
2009). For the better implementation of any e0gover nment initiative, it is important that 
there is proper diffusion of e0government initiativ e so that the benefits post0
implementation of such an initiative are being real ized by the targeted stakeholders 
(Dehkordi and Dehkordi, 2014; Fourie, 2010; Garcia0 Murillo, 2013; Zhang et al., 2014). 
Implicitly, the interaction between the governments  and the citizens improves on account 
of e0government initiatives (Koutrakou, 2006). The benefits of launching e0government 
initiatives lie in their being targeted for citizen s and reduction of corruption as well as 
reduction of operational cost (Saxena, 2005). E0gov ernment benefits the users in terms of 
saving their time and energy (Alshawi and Alalwany,  2009; Hiller and Belanger, 2001). 
However, where inadequate e0government initiatives exist alongside corrupt practices in 
administration, users have to spend a lot of their time and money in getting the tasks done 
(Asogwa, 2012). At the same time, it is important t hat the public personnel in charge of 
implementing the e0government initiatives be traine d adequately so that the 
implementation is eased at different levels (Vasiu and Vasiu, 2006). Often, e0government 
initiatives fail because they are unable to check c orrupt practices in public service 
delivery (Alaswani, 2016). Red0tapism is one of the  major factors which impacts e0
government initiatives adversely (Al0Madi, Al0Shrai deh and Khrais, 2016; Kalsi and 
Kiran, 2013; Singh et al., 2010).                 
 
Research on e0government initiatives in developing countries has revealed diverse 
insights. E0government initiatives have been succes sful in curbing corruption in Iran 
(Saghafi, Zarei and Fadaei, 2016). E0government ini tiative in Kazakhstan has also 
yielded significant results in terms of curbing cor ruption (Sheryazdanova and Butterfield, 
2017). However, there are many instances where e0go vernment initiatives failed to earn 
their desired outcomes. For instance, nepotism and favoritism marred the e0government 
initiatives in Nigeria (Akingbade, et al., 2012). E gypt faced problems in terms of digital 
divide as far as e0government implementation is con cerned (Reddick, Abdelsalam and 
Elkadi, 2012). In Bangladesh, there are challenges in achieving e0government outcomes 
owing to the lack of IT infrastructure, corruption,  lack of trained personnel and other 
macro0economic factors like poverty and illiteracy among the citizens (Faroqi and 
Downloaded by Stephen F Austin State University At 13:12 29 January 2018 (PT)
Siddiquee, 2011). Furthermore, favoritism, observan ce of government secrecy and lack of 
motivation among public officials led to difficulti es in e0government implementation in 
Jordan (Al0Madi, Al0Shraideh and Khrais, 2016).    
 
Academic research on e0government initiatives in th e Indian context has been underway 
in which different dimensions have been probed. For  instance, success factors responsible 
for implementing e0government initiatives have been  probed in the Indian context 
wherein it has been underlined that there is immens e need for taking into account the 
human resource policies, vision and objectives of e 0government initiatives, 
institutionalization of a robust e0government roadm ap, availability of a suitable 
infrastructure, establishing an action plan with de finite targets and deliverables and 
clarity in policies regarding privacy and security (Kalsi and Kiran, 2013). In a conceptual 
study where five different e0government initiatives  have been probed, corruption was 
found to be a major factor in the failed e0governme nt implementation (Ojha and Palvia, 
2012). In another study, it was found that e0govern ment projects fail owing to factors like 
lack of training, sustained leadership and commitme nt, institutionalization and evaluation 
of e0government initiatives (Kumar and Best, 2006).  Likewise, it has been underlined that 
lack of transparency is a major concern in developi ng countries like India, Ethiopia and 
Fiji (Singh et al., 2010). Besides, there are issue s related with cost incurred in availing 
public services, time taken to avail public service s and red0tapism involved in availing 
these public services.      
 
In the extant literature, there are many lacunas wh ich are clearly evident. First, empirical 
studies seeking to establish a linkage between prev alence of corruption and the 
implementation of e0government initiatives have bee n visibly lacking. Second, most of 
the studies are focused on the conceptual framework  and there are few studies which 
have been conducted in the Indian settings. Third, institutional theory has not been 
invoked in previous studies. Finally, despite the s ignificance of “Digital India” initiatives 
in the Indian context, academic probe has been want ing. The present study seeks to 
address these concerns by appreciating the impact o f “Digital India” initiatives in curbing 
corruption.   
 
2.2  Institutional theory 
 
The basic fundamentals governing institutional theo ry lie in appreciating the role of the 
symbolic, material and cultural considerations whic h influence the institutionalization of 
any innovation or policy (King et al., 1994) with t he overall objective of establishing a 
practice, policy or innovation and ensuring its acc eptability by the concerned 
stakeholders over a period of time (Scott, 2001; Zu cker, 1977). Institutional theory has 
been invoked in research based on Information Syste ms (IS) and the theory serves to 
explain the complexity involved in predicting a soc ial phenomena (Currie, 2009). In the 
context of IS, institutional theory holds relevance  in the sense that an entity or a process 
may be considered as an institution (Currie, 2009).  Furthermore, the theory holds 
relevance in assessing the manner in which technolo gies are designed, used and 
implemented by the organizations (Orlikowski and Ba rley, 2001). Conceding that 
Downloaded by Stephen F Austin State University At 13:12 29 January 2018 (PT)
“Digital India” is an e0government innovation, we a im to deploy institutional theory for 
the present purpose.        
 
Institutional theory has been used to investigate t he extent to which e0government 
initiatives have succeeded in attaining their goals  of transparency and accountability in 
government. For instance, political, social, organi zational and technological challenges 
have been identified as critical failure factors fo r implementing e0government initiatives 
in Qatar (El0Haddadeh, Weerakkody and Al0Shafi, 201 3). Institutional theory is linked 
with the study as it helps to appreciate the underl ying challenges in the implementation of 
e0government initiatives conceding that such initia tives were a part of the aim of the 
government to gain legitimacy from different stakeh olders like citizens, international 
politics and the like. In another study focused on appreciating the success of ICT 
initiatives in India, South Africa and Brazil, inst itutional theory was referred to underline 
the challenges in attaining the aim of digital incl usion (Madon, Reinhard, Roode and 
Walsham, 2009). Finally, in the third study based i n Nigeria, it was underscored how the 
introduction of electronic voters’ registration (EV R) system led to problems owing to 
lack of political will and commitment on the part o f the government (McGrath and 
Maiye, 2010). Therefore, the institutionalization o f the e0government reform posed 
difficulty there. The crux of this review is that i nstitutional theory has not been referred to 
appreciate the impact of instituting an e0governmen t innovation on curbing corruption in 
public service delivery.          
 
3. Hypotheses 
 
Demographic variables may be used for understanding  the willingness of citizens to 
adopt e0government services (Al0Somali et al., 2009 ; Hernandez et al., 2011; Tarhini et 
al., 2014a, 2014b). There have been limited studies  which seek to probe the direct impact 
of demographic variables on the adoption of e0gover nment tools (Teo, 2001; Chan and 
Chong, 2013). For the purpose of the present study,  five demographic variables are being 
examined to understand the extent to which corrupti on is perceived in government 
services post0launch of "Digital India" initiative.   
 
The demographic variable of gender has been investi gated in terms of adoption of 
internet technologies (Teo, 2001; Al0Somali et al.,  2009; Chan and Chong, 2013; 
Venkatesh et al., 2014; Tarhini et al., 2014a, 2014 b). The relationship between gender 
and Internet usage was explored by Teo (2001) where in it was found that women use 
Internet more for messaging as compared with men. I t was further shown in the same 
study that men use Internet for downloading and pur chasing items but the same was not 
the case for women in a significant manner (Teo, 20 01). In another study, it was found 
that there are no differences among men and women a s far as the usage of mobile 
technologies is concerned (Chan and Chong, 2013). I n the context of the present study, it 
may be underlined that: 
 
H1: Men are more likely to perceive corruption in e 0government services, in comparison 
to women.

The second demographic variable which is being take n into consideration is that of age 
wherein past research has shown that age has a sign ificant influence on the adoption of 
computer and Internet technologies (Teo, 2001; Cutl er et al., 2003; Chan and Chong, 
2013). Also, research has shown that there are age variations in the ownership and usage 
of computers. Lower Internet usage is witnessed amo ng older users as compared with 
younger users (Teo, 2001). In another research, it was demonstrated how younger people 
are more engaged in the usage of mobile technologie s as compared to the older 
generation (Chan and Chong, 2013). Thus, contextual izing the aforesaid for the present 
study, we posit that: 
 
H2: Age is negatively associated with the perceptio n of corruption in e0government 
services. 
 
Finally, the third demographic variable which is be ing considered for the present study is 
that of education. As such, there is limited resear ch which is focused on exploring the 
relationship between education and computer usage ( Teo, 2001). It has been shown in 
South Korean context that individuals with higher e ducational qualification are more 
likely to use Internet (Rhee and Kim, 2004). Howeve r, in another study, it has been found 
that individuals with higher educational levels are  less likely to use Internet for 
messaging and browsing activities (Teo, 2001). In a nother case, it was found that 
individuals who are highly educated tend to use com puters in a more liberal way than 
those who are less educated (Brown and Venkatesh, 2 005). It is presumable that highly 
educated people have relatively less time to spend on the Internet (Teo, 2001). In another 
study, it was found that highly educated people ten d to use Internet for conducting 
transactions (Chan and Chong, 2013). Likewise, in t he Indian context, it was 
demonstrated that there is a relationship between e ducation and personality traits with the 
usage of e0government services (Venkatesh, et al., 2014). Contextualizing the aforesaid 
in the present study, it may be hypothesized that: 
 
H3: Education is positively associated with the per ception of corruption in e0government. 
 
The fourth demographic variable which has been take n into account for the present study 
relates to the marital status of the individual use rs. Previous research has underlined the 
implications of marital status on internet usage (A ni, Uchendu and Atseye, 2007; Lu et 
al., 2002) wherein it has been demonstrated that ma rried people are less likely to use 
Internet as compared with the single users. Implici tly, we hypothesize that: 
 
H4: Single users are more likely to perceive corrup tion in e0government than the married 
users. 
 
The fifth demographic variable under consideration pertains to professional status and it's 
relevance for perception of corruption in e0governm ent. Studies have been conducted to 
link Internet use with different professionals. For  instance, the extent of Internet usage 
among quantity surveying professionals has been pro bed in Hong Kong (Shen et al., 
2003). In another study, Internet use was investiga ted in terms of its usage for academic 
purposes among Australian academics (Applebee et al ., 2000). Finally, the extent of 
Downloaded by Stephen F Austin State University At 13:12 29 January 2018 (PT)
Internet usage was investigated among health care p rofessionals (Moseley, 2004). 
Contextualizing the aforesaid in the present study,  we hypothesize that: 
 
H5: Professional status is a determining factor in perception of corruption in e0
government. 
 
 
4. Research design 
 
4.1  Research methodology 
 
For the purpose of the present study, we refer the Good Governance Week report 
published in December 2015, “Best Performing Distri cts Per State/UT”. In this report, 
examples of successful e0government initiatives wer e identified and ranking was done 
for Indian districts across different States/Union Territories (Good Governance Week 
Report, 2015). In the present study, our purpose wa s served by conducting an email 
survey to ascertain the perceptions of users in tap ping e0government initiatives post0
launch of “Digital India” initiative in the country . We purposively selected 
respondents from the “Best Performing districts in States/Union Territories” and by 
adopting a convenient sampling technique, we emaile d actual users of e0government 
“Digital India” platform to submit their responses.    
      
4.2  “Digital India” initiative 
 
“Digital India” (http://www.digitalindia.gov.in/) i nitiative is a combine of e0
government services across different public service s. As such, “Digital India” 
initiative has its origins in the National e0Govern ment Plan (NeGP) which was 
launched in 2006.The initiative was launched under the aegis of the Ministry of 
Electronics & Information Technology (www.meity.gov .in). Launched by Prime 
Minister Narendra Modi, top CEOs from abroad commit ted to invest Rs. 4.5 lakh 
crore towards sustaining this initiative. In order to ensure the smooth implementation 
of the "Digital India" initiative, a Monitoring Com mittee was instituted under the 
leadership of Prime Minister. Also, there is a Digi tal India Advisory Group chaired 
by the Ministry of Communications and IT as well as  an Apex Committee chaired by 
the Cabinet Secretary. The initiative has three “vi sion(s)”: to install digital 
infrastructure for being utilized by all citizens; to provide on0demand public services 
and to ensure digital empowerment of citizens. Besi des, there are nine “programme 
pillars”: Broadband Highways, Universal Access to M obile Connectivity, Public 
Internet Access Programme, e0Governance0Reforming G overnment Through 
Technology, e0Kranti0Electronic delivery of service s, Information for All, Electronics 
Manufacturing, IT for Jobs, Early Harvest Programme s. In all, there are about 2400 e0
government services which are being provided as a p art of the “Digital India” 
initiative. These e0government services are provide d across diverse domains like 
election rolls, marriages, employment, etc. However , at present, only a few services 
may be availed by the users. While the underlying p remise of launching the “Digital 
India” remains curbing corruption in public service s, there have been vociferous 
Downloaded by Stephen F Austin State University At 13:12 29 January 2018 (PT)
demands and appeals from different quarters to curb  corruption and nepotism in 
public service delivery and to ensure greater trans parency and public accountability in 
administration. For instance, political leaders lik e Anna Hazare 
(http://www.annahazare.org/anticorruption0movement. html) and Subramanyam 
Swamy (https://www.fcchk.org/tag/subramanian0swamy/ ) have been actively 
involved in voicing their demand for a transparent administration at all levels.       
 
4.3  Data collection 
 
For the purpose of the study, 383 email surveys wer e conducted across three cities 
(West Delhi, Chandigarh and Panchkula) which have b een identified as “Best 
Performing districts”. While some of the respondent s were known through formal or 
informal channels, others were contacted through in direct or direct references. 
Overall, the response rate was 67% out of which the  percentage of actual usable 
questionnaires reduced to 56.65% (217 responses). A  five0point Likert scale was used 
to gauge respondents’ perceptions across different dimensions of checking corruption 
(perception regarding corruption in public services , extent of red0tapism in public 
services, time taken for securing public services, cost incurred in procuring public 
services, provision of a single portal for procurin g public services, increased 
government inefficiency, extent of favoritism in pu blic services, easier procedures to 
secure public services, extent of transparency in p ublic services and grievance 
resolution procedures) post0launch of “Digital Indi a” initiative. We posit that: with 
the launch of "Digital India" initiative, red0tapis m should reduce; time taken for 
availing e0government services should reduce; cost incurred in availing e0government 
services should reduce; single portal should be mad e available for availing e0
government services; government inefficiency should  decrease; favoritism should 
decrease; easier procedures should be instituted fo r availing e0government services; 
transparency should increase in administration and grievance resolution procedures 
should not be taxing. Among the demographic factors  may be counted age, marital 
status, gender, education and professional status ( Table 1).

4.4  Scale reliability 
 
Since we invoked 10 items to gauge the perception o f corruption in e0government 
services, we calculated the reliability and interna l consistency of items for which 
Cronbach’s alpha was computed. Cronbach’s alpha is 0.96 which is greater than the 
recommended value of 0.7 (Hair et al., 2010), we co nclude that our scale is reliable. 
Furthermore, item0wise Cronbach’s alpha (Table 2) s upported the internal 
consistency in the sample in line with the general recommendations that the 
Cronbach’s alpha should be greater than 0.7 (Hair e t al., 2010). Therefore, this 
provides robustness to our initial steps.

5. Results and analysis 
 
5.1  Correlations 
 
For measuring the linear association between the 15  variables under study, we 
calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficients (Tabl e 3). Correlations show that gender 
has a significant relationship with the perception of corruption in e0government 
services. However, there is no significant relation ship of other demographic variables 
(age, marital status, educational status, professio nal status) with the perception of 
corruption in e0government services. Furthermore, g ender continues to have 
significant relationship with the items like increa sed government inefficiency, 
transparency in public services, time taken for ava iling e0government services, 
grievance resolution mechanisms, cost incurred in a vailing e0government services, 
favoritism in e0government services and user0friend ly procedures for availing e0
government services. Implicitly, males perceive dec line in corruption in e0

government services post0launch of "Digital India" initiative. Males perceive that 
government inefficiency has declined and less time and cost are incurred while 
availing e0government services. However, males perc eive that transparency in 
availing e0government services remains a challenge.  Males find that grievance 
resolution procedures are more favorable post0launc h of "Digital India" initiative. 
However, the procedures for tapping e0government se rvices are not user0friendly and 
there is favoritism in availing e0government servic es. Correlations also show that 
educational status is linked with the provision of a single portal for availing e0
government services. Conceding that there is an abs ence of a single portal for availing 
e0government services, highly educated individuals are finding it difficult to procure 
e0government services through multiple portals. Als o, professional status is linked 
with the cost incurred in availing e0government ser vices. Implicitly, students or 
housewives might have to pay less income tax or pro fessional tax as compared with 
the salaried individuals or business professionals.

5.2  Hierarchical regression 
 
In the second part of the analysis, we invoke hiera rchical regression analysis for our 
purpose. The dependent variable in this case is “pe rception of corruption in public 
services” and the other items are included as indep endent variables. In this way, we 
will be able to assess the impact of independent va riables on the dependent variable in 
terms of the variance explained by the former in th e latter. First, we include the 
demographic variables into the analysis. Thereafter , other items are included in the 
analysis. It may be underlined, however, that hiera rchical regression models hold 
their limitations in the sense that in social scien ce research where individual 
responses (averages) are used as group0level predic tors, misleading conclusions may 
result when one interprets them as “contextual effe cts” (Gelman and Hill, 2007). 
Finally, hierarchical regression models do not impl y causation.  
 
In the present case, we invoke the model as:  
 
Perception of corruption in public services = β 0+ β 1 * Professional status + β 2 * 
Educational status + β 3 * Gender + β 4 * Marital status + β 5 * Age + β 6 * Extent of red 
tapism in public services + β 7 * Time taken for securing public services + β 8 * Cost 
incurred in procuring public services + β 9 * Single portal for securing public services 
+ β 10  * Increased government inefficiency + β 11  * Extent of favoritism in public 
services + β 12  * Easier procedures to secure public services + β 13  * Extent of 
transparency in public services + β 14  * Grievance resolution is taxing 
 
The first step involved in the analysis is to asses s the impact of demographic variables 
on the perception of corruption in e0government ser vices. In the second step of 
hierarchical regression analysis, the remaining var iables are being inserted in the 
equation. Hierarchical regression results are repro duced in Table 4. It is shown that in 
the first step, R 2 is 0.042 which increases to 0.949 when the remaini ng variables are 
entered thereby contributing to the variance of the  model. In addition, variables other 
than demographic ones contribute 94.6% to the varia tion of perception of corruption 
in e0government services. Implicitly, among the dem ographic variables, only gender 
has a statistically significant relationship with t he dependent variable0“perception of 
corruption in public services”. This result corrobo rates with the correlation results and 
indicates that males perceive decline in corruption  in e0government services post0
launch of “Digital India” initiative. As far as the  second step is concerned, we find 
that availing e0government services is costly. This  finding may be owing to the fact 
that face0to0face interaction is also required in m any cases to avail public services. 
Furthermore, while favoritism seems to have witness ed a decline, there is an increase 
in government inefficiency. This mixed result may b e attributed to the fact that only 
few e0government services are active as of now and ground realities may be different 
from the visionary ideals espoused under the “Digit al India” programme. Finally, 
there is low transparency in availing public servic es post0launch of the “Digital India” 
initiative.

6. Discussion 
 
The present study has underlined that while India’s  “Digital India” initiative is underway, 
the key visions of the initiative are yet to be rea lized. Our results are in line with the 
previous research that e0government initiatives are  yet to curb corruption (Belwal and Al0
Zoubi, 2008; Lio, Liu and Ou, 2011). Correlations a nd hierarchical regression results 
show that demographic variables, except gender, hav e less significant influence on the 
perception of corruption in e0government services. Our results are in sharp contrast with 
the findings of a recent research where no signific ant difference was found to exist 
between men and women as far as the willingness to use e0government services is 
concerned (Sharma, 2015). This may be attributed to  the context of study because 
Sharma (2015) conducted his study in Oman0a Middle East country with entirely 
different culture than India (Yeganeh, 2014). Furth er studies are required to include more 
Downloaded by Stephen F Austin State University At 13:12 29 January 2018 (PT)
demographic variables like income, number of depend ents, assets because they might 
determine the extent of availing e0government servi ces. For instance, for an elderly 
couple living with dependents, availing e0governmen t services might be difficult than for 
the younger couple with no dependents. Furthermore,  this would have an impact on the 
frequency with which e0government services are bein g availed.       
 
Results also show that corruption has not declined post0launch of the “Digital India” 
initiative even in the “Best Performing districts”.  Citizens have to incur costs in availing 
e0government services and conceding that the “Digit al India” platform is yet to realize its 
full0fledged aims by providing a single portal and inclusion of many other government 
services, the government innovation requires much t o be accomplished. Hence, as per the 
institutional theory, the Indian government must in stitutionalize the “Digital India” 
initiative in a streamlined manner to ensure effici ency, economy, effectiveness, 
transparency and public accountability.  
 
7. Conclusion 
 
By responding to the call of previous research that  challenges and concerns of launching 
and implementing e0government initiatives in India should be researched (Alathur et al., 
2012; Alathur et al., 2014), our study showed that despite laying down the fundamentals 
of the “Digital India” initiative, the actual goals  are yet to be realized in terms of 
decreased corruption and increased transparency in public service delivery. While 
“Digital India” may be conceived as an anti0corrupt ion strategy (Anderson, 2009), the 
actual implementation of the initiative is fraught with loopholes and citizens are not 
perceiving a decline in malpractices like corruptio n, nepotism, favoritism, etc. 
Furthermore, in the absence of a single portal to a vail e0government services, users find 
the “Digital India” platform as complex and not use r0friendly. Finally, with few public 
services open for being availed through the “Digita l India” initiative, it is clear that the 
initiative is in its early stages of growth. In lin e with the institutional theory which 
requires sustainability of any government innovatio n or practice (Kim, Kim and Lee, 
2009), we conclude that “Digital India” is yet to b e institutionalized in a robust manner. 
Apparently, “Digital India” initiative requires fur ther diffusion and adaptation among the 
users (Currie, 2009).      
 
8. Study limitations and future research directions 
 
The study holds some limitations. First, we include d respondents from three cities only 
and convenience sampling was used to identify the r espondents. Further research is 
required with the inclusion of more cities and incr ease in the number of respondents. 
Second, we picked only demographic variables as the  main focus variables and it would 
be better if more demographic variables are include d in the study. Third, further research 
is required using a longitudinal approach wherein t he impact of “Digital India” may be 
appreciated over a period of time as far as curbing  corruption is concerned. Fourth, 
quality of e0government services (Anwer et al., 201 6) provided under the “Digital India” 
initiative needs to be probed further. Our study ma y be replicated in other contexts 
(Siddiquee, 2016) to ascertain the differences in p erception of corruption among citizens 
via0a0vis the extent of maturity of e0government se rvices. Fifth, theories other than 
Downloaded by Stephen F Austin State University At 13:12 29 January 2018 (PT)
institutional theory0 Public Service Motivation the ory (Kim and Kim 2016), principal 
agent theory (De Vries and Sobis, 2016) or self0det ermination theory (Andrews, 2016)0
may be explored in further research. Finally, facto rs like infrastructure, literacy and 
government size may be included as determining fact ors in further research to assess the 
extent of corruption in e0government services in In dia (Weerakkody, Dwivedi, and 
Kurunananda, 2009; Zhao and Xu, 2015). 
 
9. Practical implications 
 
There are different implications for practitioners.  First, it is important that sustained 
leadership, trained human resources, ethical public  officials should be responsible for 
manning e0government services (Kumar and Best, 2006 ). Public officials should be 
provided the required tools and techniques for faci litating the launch and implementation 
of e0government services in the country. Grievance resolution mechanisms should be 
made more robust so that citizens perceive e0govern ment services as transparent and 
user0friendly. Government should aim at instituting  a robust IT infrastructure across the 
country and launch measures for digital inclusion. Finally, more government departments 
should spearhead their initiatives in conducting pa perless transactions and providing 
public services in a transparent and efficient mann er.
