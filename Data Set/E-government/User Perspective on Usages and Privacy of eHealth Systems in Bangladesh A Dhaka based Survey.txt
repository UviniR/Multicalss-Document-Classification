Abstract - Electronic Health (eHealth) systems and devices 
are getting popular in developing countries due to many benefits to the users. To improve wider users’ acceptance of eHealth systems in developing countries, eHealth community needs a clear understanding of user’s expectations and needs which may not be the same as developed countries due to differences in education, socio-economic status, social values and beliefs. This paper contributes to the understanding of users’ perspectives on usages and privacy aspects of the 
eHealth systems and devices in Bangladesh. In this study, the 
participants who were 18 years or older were randomly selected across Dhaka for the electronic response to the survey questions. The survey result shows that 64% of the young generation under 35 years of age are not seriously concern about the privacy of their general and personal health information, though it is a primary concern to most of the people in Bangladesh. Regarding the consequences of 
disclosing health information to others, female respondents were more reactive than their counterparts. 
Key words - Electronic health, Privacy, Consequence, 
mHealth. 
I.    INTRODUCTION 
Due to the rapid growth of population, developing 
countries like Bangladesh are facing a shortage of qualified 
health professionals [11, 12]. At the same time, the uses of 
technology to maintain health are growing due to the 
continuous growth of internet users in developing 
countries. The circumstances  changed rapidly in recent 
times due to the faster aggression of telecommunication applications among the mass population in developing 
countries. Nowadays, health consciousness is not a fashion 
of wealthy people but also a passion for middle-class 
people who mostly thrives their life from hard working 
professions. The electronic health systems, such as mHealth applications and devices, web-based health 
portals, and health blogs, may provide easy access to 
quality healthcare for the disadvantaged population. 
Many studies have been conducted to understand the 
usages patterns and privacy concerns for the users of 
eHealth systems and devices [4, 7, 18, 13, 14, 22]. 
However, almost all of them ar e considered for the users of 
eHealth systems in developed countries like Germany [14], US [13], China [22] and Hong Kong [4]. Understanding 
users’ perspectives on usages and privacy aspects of the 
eHealth systems and devices in developing countries is also important. With this aim, in this paper, we have surveyed 
1,499 participants from Dhaka to understand users’ views 
towards usages and privacy of eHealth systems and 
devices. Data from the survey ed result are processed and 
analysed to identify the user s’ perspectives on usage and 
privacy of the eHealth system. 
With further explanation and discussion, the rest of the 
paper has been organised as follows. Section II presented 
the background and significance of this study followed by 
methodology and data collection in section III. In section 
IV, we have presented statistical analysis and discussion. 
Finally, the conclusion and limitations have been described 
in section V. 
II.   BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE 
Literature in the field of mHealth privacy can be 
classified into four main categories: privacy law [11, 12]; 
privacy policy [2, 11, 12, 16]; identification of privacy risks 
[1, 10, 17]; and user’s views towards mHealth privacy and 
electronic transmission of medi cal information [8, 20, 21]. 
There is also literature on users’ prevalence and perception 
of mHealth usages [4, 13, 14, 22 ], technical review [19] and 
solution [3] to address the privacy risks. This section is 
prepared after an extensive literature review to highlight the 
current state-of-the-art and the significance of the study. 
Several studies [2, 11, 12, 16] investigated the impact 
and standardisation of privacy policies for mHealth 
applications. Most investigations found that the privacy 
policies of mHealth applications were either confusing or 
did not exist. McCarthy, M. in [11] identified that, despite 
the efforts taken by the government to educate consumers and to provide guidance to developers, confusion persists 
amongst consumers due to large gaps in policies with 
respect to information access, security, and privacy. In the 
survey, A. et al. [2] identified that the majority of health 
applications (70%) do not have a privacy policy, and for 
those that do, focuses on the ap plication itself (rather on the 2020 IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Computer Science and Data Engineering (CSDE) | 978-1-6654-1974-1/20/$31.00 ©2020 IEEE | DO I: 10.1109/CSDE50874.2020.9411593

available policies do not make the information transparent on privacy practices and are often too wordy to understand 
for general users. The authors suggested the necessity of 
developing international regulations for mobile health 
information collection, storage, and privacy. The article 
[16] focused on mobile health apps for diabetes and again 
found that many of these apps do not have a privacy policy. 
They pointed out that users might mistakenly believe that 
health information entered an application is private, 
particularly if the app has a privacy policy, but that 
generally is not the case. Worryingly, many of these 
mHealth apps access various se rvices of mobile devices 
that are not related to their functionality, such as camera access or modifying the conten t of external USB devices. 
According to the study by [7], most apps share information 
with third parties that are not directly under the developers’ 
control, such as data aggregators or advertising networks. 
Wen D. et al. [21] investigated user’s perspectives on 
the usage of wearable devices. The data of [21] shows that 
59.8% of users in China are discouraged to use health 
applications due to privacy concerns. The paper by [20] identified that older adults place greater emphasis on health 
care providers as opposed to personal access for managing 
their mHealth data and privacy. At the same time, younger 
adults are highly likely to withhold information in mHealth 
system out of concerns for privacy and security. O’Donnell, H. C., et al. [8] investigated consumers’ attitudes towards 
health information exchange between institutes and 
personal mHealth devices. The article has concluded that 
mHealth applications need to address consumer’s security 
concerns and disparities in standards for health information 
exchange. 
The articles [3, 5, 6, 19] have studied various patterns 
of mHealth app use and perception of mHealth users in the US, Germany, Hong Kong, and China. Several articles [5, 
6] reported that the use of mHealth applications have an 
inverse correlation with age among adults but have a linear 
correlation with education, socio-economic factors, and 
social status. On the contrary, Rasche, P. et al. [3] reported 
that gender or education did not show any significant 
differences in the use of h ealth apps in Germany. In 
Germany [3] adults are likely to  use health apps if they are 
at the lower end of the age range and have a high level of 
technical readiness which is in contrast with the findings in 
previous national surveys in the United States [19] and 
Hong Kong [5]. 
Information privacy [3, 14, 19], accuracy [9, 13] and 
standardisation [13, 14, 22] are some common expectations 
of users that are required to fulfil before mHealth systems 
can be adopted by mass population. A unique example in 
this line is reported by Krebs P. et al. [13] which described 
that users of mHealth systems in the US have high confidence in the accuracy and safety of their data, despite 
the authors’ acknowledged the lack of standardization, 
monitoring, and third-part y access to mHealth data. 
Dehling T. et al. [19] considered over 24,405 health-related 
apps (iOS; 21,953; Android; 2452) for information security and privacy risk assessments. He described that most of the 
apps that access health related critical information and provide health assessments are putting its users in the 
information security and privacy risks. 
Fatema K. et al. [20] have studied mHealth Services of 
Chakaria, a rural sub-district in Bangladesh. They have 
concluded that knowledge of existing mHealth services was 
well accepted among participants . The authors claimed that 
the compliance with the prescriptions was almost similar 
for advice received through mHealth devices, hence, there is a clear indication that surveyed society is looking 
forward to embracing mHealth technology. However, this 
result is done in a small sub-district which does not reflect 
the opportunity or view of the greater part of Bangladeshi 
population. 
Hannah et al. [21] conducted an investigative study in a 
remote district of Bangladesh to explore the behavioural 
impact and barriers in the adaptation of mHealth in mass people. They adopted both the COM-B (Capability, 
Opportunity, and Motivation-Behaviour) model and the 
Transtheoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to formulate 
a concrete guideline in the formative research of behaviour 
change, which might be helpful to conceptualise the awareness-rising and behaviour change in mHealth. They 
focused on the quality of equipment in diabetic 
management and control in Bangladesh, which was found 
very low.  
As of today, the adaptation rate of mHealth 
technologies among the elderly people in comparison to the 
other group of people are very low [15, 22]. In this study, 
the researchers applied the Un ified Theory of Acceptance 
and Use of Technology (UTAUT) to develop a model on 
the acceptance of mHealth tec hnologies among the elderly 
people of Bangladesh. They conducted a face to face study 
among the elderly and another group of people. The study 
results revealed some indicators such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, technology 
anxiety and resistance to change, which has significant 
impact on the behavioural attitudes of elderly people.   
As detailed above, users of eHealth systems are 
concerned about the privacy of their data and confused 
about current security protection measures and relevant 
privacy laws. Furthermore, a very little study has been done 
to understand a larger segment of upcoming eHealth users who can be most benefitted from its capabilities.  This 
shows the need for a user centr ic approach to address the 
privacy issues of eHealth systems. As a step towards this, 
we have collected and analysed  users’ views of usage and 
privacy of eHealth systems. 
III. METHODOLOGY AND DATA COLLECTION 
This paper reports on the data collected from an online 
survey conducted by CQUniversity, Australia and 
Bangladesh University of Business and Technology, 
Bangladesh. The survey aims to obtain public opinion on a 
range of topics from the selected random sample of 
Bangladeshi residents in Dhaka. Random samples from all 
Authorized licensed use limited to: Carleton University. Downloaded on June 05,2021 at 20:49:18 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. the four Dhaka city corporat ions were selected following 
the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics [3] database and contacted via email for an onlin e survey. Out of all invited 
people, only 30% agreed to participate in the survey, out of 
which 20% filled the entire online survey. We have used 
Survey Monkey to conduct our online survey which only 
considered participants from the 18 to 70 age group. 
A. Data collection process 
The survey was conducted between 2nd of November 
2017 to 9 January 2018. Data collection was conducted via 
telephone interviews, which comprised of a standard 
introduction and asking some demographic and core health 
questions. In total there were 10 questions that were pilot 
tested on 83 randomly selected students to create the final 
questionnaire. The questions were on consumer 
perspectives of personal electronic health privacy, with 
some of the questions specifically about electronic 
healthcare records, and others about data on personal 
healthcare devices and applications.   
The estimated sample error,  at the 95% confidence 
interval, is 
±2.8  percentage points. Several questions were 
used for quality assurance. On a scale of 1 (very poor) to 10 
(excellent), the quality of the survey had a mean score of 
8.6. Almost all respondents (96%) found the survey 
questions very easy or mostly easy to understand (4-level 
Likert scale).  
B. Representativeness of the samples 
A cluster sampling approach was considered to decide 
the sample units of this study. Dhaka City Corporation is 
divided into two parts as Dhaka City Corporation North (DNCC) and Dhaka city Corporation South (DSCC). A 
total of 1499 sample units comprised of 329 units from 
DNCC and 1170 units from DSCC were selected on a 
random basis to ensure the representativeness of the 
sample. For a further check on this issue, the chi-square analysis was conducted for the category of age and gender. 
The results for both categories are (/g1876
/g2870 (/g1856/g1858 = 2, /g2009 =
.05)  =  .456, /g1868 = .797) /g1853/g1866/g1856 ( /g1876/g2870(/g1856/g1858 = 1, /g2009 = .05)  =
 38.756, /g1868 = .00) . The result for age supports the 
representativeness of the sample to the population, whereas 
the gender result does not support it. But the sex ratio in the 
sample is completely matched with the sex ratio in the 
population of Dhaka city (104 males for 100 females), 
which can also be considered as the indicator of 
representativeness of the sample to the population.  
IV.  STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND 
DISCUSSION 
Data were analysed using Statistical Package for the 
Social Sciences (SPSS) version 24 (IBM Corp).  The 
survey data consists of different characteristics of 
participants including demographic (age, gender) and case 
specific from the questionnaire. Below are the discussions 
of the results with appropriate graphs and interpretations. 
 A. Demographic characteristics of the Participants and 
their uses of health apps 
The total number of participants in this study was in 
1499. The range of age was 18 to 76 years with mean 43.95 
years and standard deviation 15.29. For a better presentation of the participants by age, we considered three 
age categories such as age between 18 to 35 years, 36 to 53 
years, and over 54 years.  The number of participants in 
three age groups were 516 (34.4%), 508 (33.9%), and 475 
(31.7%) respectively as illustrated in Figure 1. Respondents 
were diversified into male and female as 870 (58%) male 
and 629 (42%) females as presented in Figure 1.  
 
Fig. 1. Distribution of participants’ age and gender. 
Regarding participants’ preferences of several ways to store 
their health information, most of the 855 (57.2%) participants were found to like electronic medium to record 
it.  
B. Respondents’ attitude on the privacy of the recorded 
health information 
Health related information is usually considered as a 
personalized issue. Disclosure of personal health 
information to others can also be considered as a matter of 
compliance in most of the countries in the world. To know 
the preferences of the respondents on this issue they were asked: “how much they are concern about the privacy of 
health information”. For analysis purposes, respondents 
were categorised as per their age and gender. Regardless of 
all categories almost all of them (97.9% to 99.7%) highly 
concern about privacy of their health information. More 
specifically both the personal and general health 
information’s privacy issues were equally important to 
them. We conducted Chi-square tests between the privacy 
issue and the different categories of the respondents such as 
age, gender, and likeliness of health apps. Most of the test 
results show insignificant except the tests between privacy 
issue and likeliness of using different health applications. The Chi-square results for two kinds of health information 
are found as personal (22.617, /g1856/g1858 = 4, /g1868 /g3398 /g1874/g1853/g1864/g1873/g1857 =  0.0)  
and general (12.988, /g1856/g1858 = 4, /g1868 /g3398 /g1874/g1853/g1864/g1873/g1857 =  0.011) . Both 
the results indicate that th ere are statistically valid 
associations between the privacy issue and respondents’ likeliness of using health apps. 
The survey data were analysed by using a statistical 
cross tabulation procedure between the privacy issue and how often they review the privacy of health apps and how 
concern they are if the health information known by others. 
Authorized licensed use limited to: Carleton University. Downloaded on June 05,2021 at 20:49:18 UTC from IEEE Xplore.  Restrictions apply. The results show no significant difference in the attitude 
about the privacy of health apps among the different levels of respondents. The chi-square test result between the 
privacy issue of health apps and how much they are 
concerns if the health information known by others appears 
as significant (226.046, /g1856/g1858 = 4, /g1868 /g3398 /g1874/g1853/g1864/g1873/g1857 =  0.00) . 
Therefore, we can conclude that there is a statistically valid association between these two issues.     
According to the results of the study, nearly 61% of the 
respondents to whom the privacy of health apps is important did not like to use the health apps. On the 
contrary, 73% of the respondents to whom privacy of the 
health apps is not so important did like to use health apps. 
Both the facts highlight a lack of efficiency of privacy 
features of the health apps, which could be an important 
message to the manufacturing companies of those devices.  
C. Respondents’ attitudes on the security issues of health 
apps 
Health information should be secured and safe from 
being corrupted and disclosed. This is a vital issue for the 
health-conscious people who are the users of health apps. 
To investigate this issue respondents were asked: “how 
much they are a concern if their health information is 
known by others”. The responses were analysed with cross 
tabulation technique between this security question and 
different categories of respond ents, which revealed same 
results with very little differences. For example, 
respondents who are likely (88.2%) to use health 
application concern (84.1%) about sharing their health 
information. Also, the chi-sq uare analysis between these 
two issues appears as significant (103.68, /g1856/g1858 = 4, /g1868 /g3398
/g1874/g1853/g1864/g1873/g1857 =  0.00) . Therefore, there is a statistically valid 
association between these two issues. 
 
Fig. 2. Consequences due to disclosure of health 
information 
The consequences of disclosure of health information 
could be diverse in nature. These could be the reflection of 
the community culture of the respondents, who participate 
in this study. The current study investigated the concerns of 
the respondents on this by mentioning some specific 
examples of consequences in a question with multi-
selection option. Comparatively more male respondents 
pointed to “physical harm”, “changes to the cost of health 
insurance” and “impact on mental  health” than females. On 
the other hand, females were more reactive on “losing a job”, “losing other income”, “loss of social connection of friend/ colleagues” “waste of  time” and “embarrassment” 
than their counter parts.   
Female respondents reacted to  more consequences due 
to disclosure of health information than their male 
counterparts, which underpin an important conclusion that females were more concerned than male on this issue. The 
frequencies of choosing the consequences from the given 
list were “physical harm” (741, 49.50%), “impact on 
mental health” (727, 48.6%); “embarrassment” (718, 48%), 
“changes to the cost of health insurance” (714, 47.7%, “waste of time” (707, 47.2%) and so on. 
Responses on the security issues also imposed some 
negative questions on the security features of the available health apps. This can be established from the results that 
61% of the respondents who are concerned about their 
health information aware that others do not like to use the 
health applications. Manufacturer s of health apps can also 
consider this message for their future production.  
D. Respondents’ cross-sectional attitudes on both the   
         privacy and security issues of health apps 
The health apps are residi ng on technical devices and 
subject to sudden malfunction due to various reasons. The people who are concerned about the privacy of their health 
information review the security related information of their 
used health apps very frequently. But this current study 
revealed some otherwise behaviours of the health apps 
users. It shows very little or no differences among the 
respondents’ preferences to review the health apps  (‘never 
-33%’, ‘sometimes –34%’ and ‘most times- 31%’) security 
information even they treat the privacy of their health 
information very important.  These results could be the 
reflection of the respondents’ unawareness about the virus 
attack or any software related issues to the health apps.    
V. CONCLUSION 
The concept of mHealth or eH ealth system is still at a 
developing stage despite the rapid awareness of technology in every sector in Bangladesh.  The analysis of collected 
survey data depicts that al most all the users except the 
youth cohorts are concern about the privacy of their health 
information. It could be due to a lack of knowledge of the young generation about the consequences or they are 
technically enough sound to manage their eHealth system 
to protect privacy. One important finding came out from the study on the attitude of female users of the eHealth system 
in Bangladesh. They are more concerned about the 
consequences of disclosing their health information than 
their counterpart. Strong protective social culture or 
religious bindings may be the cause of such kind of attitude of female users.  Finally, we acknowledge that a larger 
sample size would be more useful to understand the 
relationship among other demographics, such as participant 
health status and field of employment, with responses to 
privacy questions.
