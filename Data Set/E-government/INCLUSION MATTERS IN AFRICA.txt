 FOREWORD 
Over recent years, African countries have seen impressive gains in health, nutrition, 
education, and women’s empowerment. In fact, the pace of progress in some areas has been faster in Africa than in any other region. Innovation abounds in Africa and is refected in multiple areas. Some of these are the next generation of social safety nets; new platforms that provide services to remote and fragile communities; the spread of digital technology; and advocacy movements that bring previously ostracized people into public acceptance. 
Although positive developments in Africa hold promise, the continent still faces 
major challenges: from reducing poverty to overcoming fragility and managing the growing impacts of climate change. Where there have been development gains, many groups of people have not benefted from them. Who are these groups? Why have they not benefted equitably from progress and development? Why are they more likely to be poor or lack human capital? In many cases, the answer to these questions is social exclusion. 
The World Bank’s 2013 global fagship report, Inclusion Matters: The Foundation 
for Shared Prosperity, helped guide us toward better analyses and actions to combat 
social exclusion. Inclusion Matters in Africa draws on the global report, as Africa 
fnds itself at the center of rapid social and economic change, with the potential for even greater transformation. The current report on Africa resonates with the main message of the Sustainable Development Goals: Leave no one behind. This report also complements the World Bank Group’s strategy for Africa, which has increased the emphasis on social inclusion through focusing on building human capital, advancing women’s empowerment, strengthening the digital economy, combating climate change, and addressing the underlying drivers of fragility. 
Inclusion Matters in Africa tells us that peace and security are inexorably linked to 
social inclusion. Moreover, although we need to focus on reducing poverty, doing only that will not end the exclusion of some individuals and groups. This report draws attention to the structures and processes that drive social exclusion and, too often, condition people’s attitudes, perceptions, feelings, and behaviors. 
vi FOREWORD   
 
  A key fnding of the report is that, even though exclusion is costly, building an 
inclusive society is not cost free. It is a conscious decision for any country. And the decision to be inclusive must be made with a clear appreciation of the costs and benefts. As hundreds of initiatives across the continent demonstrate, with a strong social contract and greater accountability of the state and service providers to citizens, social inclusion in Africa is well within reach. 
The report is grounded in the experience of African countries but also shows that 
Africa’s challenges in social inclusion are not unique or exceptional. Our hope is that it will change the ways that policy-makers, citizens, and global partners think about development; and help us all live up to the promise of equal opportunity for everyone in Africa.

INCLUSION MATTERS IN AFRICA xi   OVERVIEW 
Main Messages 
1. Africa has seen signifcant progress towards social inclusion 
in the past few decades, in many areas moving at a pace faster than seen globally. 
2. Some groups and areas have been left out of the progress in Africa and continue to remain at risk. Social inclusion helps us understand who is left out, from what, in what ways, and why. 
3. Social inclusion draws attention to the drivers of poverty in Africa and explains that while we need to focus on poverty, this is only a starting point to end the exclusion. 
4. Structures and processes that aid and abet social exclusion often have historical and cultural roots. 
5. Areas that are affected by confict and fragility stand out as having the poorest outcomes related to social inclusion. Conversely, peace and security matter for social inclusion. 
6. Societies incur signifcant costs from social exclusion. Yet, achieving social inclusion also has costs. Therefore, investing in social inclusion has to be a conscious choice for states and societies. 
7. With a strong social contract, social inclusion in Africa is 
eminently within reach, as hundreds of initiatives across the continent demonstrate.

  Why Social Inclusion? Why Now? 
Africa today is under a global spotlight for its many achievements and its dynamism, but also for its substantial challenges. Poverty has declined; human development outcomes have improved; and dynamic social movements are helping to transform communities and bringing attention to stigmatized issues and peoples. Technological innovation has spread to many remote areas. New policies and programs across the continent have highlighted the importance of social inclusion. Some African countries have led the charge toward progress; for instance, in the past decade, Africa has implemented the most reforms promoting gender equality of any region globally. 
Yet, as in other parts of the world, positive developments have been uneven in 
Africa, too. Many areas and groups have been left behind. For instance, digital technology can leave further behind those who do not have mobile phones or Internet connections. Similarly, improved infrastructure has provided better lives but also carries risks, such as lands being unfairly taken from the most powerless or of damage to the environment or livelihoods. Improvements in education and health can be concentrated in certain locations and for some groups. Areas that experience state and societal fragility also fall behind in a spectrum of development outcomes. 
The push toward social inclusion has garnered extensive support over the past 
several years. The rallying cry of the Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs) –– leave no one behind –– has generated a groundswell of demands and actions at multiple levels. During the post-Millennium Development Goals conversations, the World Bank published its fagship report on social inclusion, Inclusion 
Matters: The Foundation for Shared Prosperity (2013). The report clearly defned social inclusion. More recently, the World Bank Group (WBG) announced its new Regional Strategy for Africa,
1 which also is rooted in the tenets of social inclusion. 
The upsurge of thought and action both within the World Bank and globally has led to several structured engagements between the WBG and a range of its partners. For example, the WBG has conducted regular Systematic Country Diagnostics (SCDs) for each of its partner countries that have shown social inclusion issues to be intrinsic to, but not the same as, poverty reduction. This report builds on these diagnostics as well as other documentation. 
The report is intended for a wide array of readers, including governments, the 
private sector, civil society, academics, and media, and others. It is also expected to infuence the ways that the Bank Group conducts its business in Africa. Like all Regional reports, it can do only limited justice to the vast heterogeneity of the continent.

 Social Inclusion: A Primer 
The term social inclusion (or just inclusion) has gained inexorable traction in 
development and broader policy debates. Thus it is important to defne what we mean. This report defnes social inclusion as the process of improving the terms for individuals and groups to take part in society (World Bank 2013). In articulating social inclusion, this report emphasizes disadvantage based on social identity. Although such emphasis can be politically sensitive, acknowledging that disadvantage often is based on social identity is important to advance social inclusion. Markers of social identity can be derived from gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, location, occupation, race, ethnicity, religion, or citizenship status, among others. Nevertheless, no single identity totally describes an individual. The intersection of identities bestows the real advantage or disadvantage. In answer to the question, “Inclusion in what?” the World Bank (2013) answers: in markets, services, and spaces. Markets comprise land, 
housing, labor, and credit. Services comprise, among others, education, health, transport, water, social protection, electricity, information, communication, and technology. The notion of space encompasses both physical space and space in a broader sense: social, political, and cultural spaces all solidify exclusion or foster inclusion. Moreover, social inclusion enhances the ability, opportunity, and dignity of individuals and groups to take part in society. The importance of ability and opportunity long has been recognized by development economists. However, the social inclusion perspective draws particular attention to the idea of dignity, which, when compromised, can have severe and unexpected consequences for individuals and groups and for society and the economy as a whole. 
This report frames its key questions using the approach of the Social Inclusion 
Assessment Tool (World Bank 2017d; Das 2016). It asks, in the wake of the enormous advances that Africa has made over the years, who is excluded, from what, how, and why. It follows the analysis by highlighting what has been attempted in African countries’ quest for social inclusion. The report highlights the major trends and transitions that shape the context for social inclusion in Africa. 
Building on recent evidence and using data from the Demographic and Health 
Survey (DHS), World Development Indicators (WDIs), Afrobarometer surveys, and World Values Survey (WVS), the report highlights key issues and identifes groups who may be left behind. Furthermore, it points to the processes that underlie exclusion and inclusion and refects on attitudes and perceptions. The report addresses important questions: Who are the key actors? What are some of the innovations that promote social inclusion in Africa? What evidence do we have on what has made a positive difference? Finally, the report gives directions on framing the right questions for inclusive solutions (fgure 0.1).

 To sum up, this report: 
• Places the notion of social inclusion front and center in an analysis of Africa’s 
achievements and its challenges in confronting poverty reduction and human capital formation. 
• Takes an interdisciplinary approach, using evidence from varied sources and bringing empirical weight to issues that are being debated through advocacy and contestation. 
• Addresses with granularity who is left out, from what, and how. The report garners and integrates evidence on historically invisible groups such as persons with disabilities, persons with albinism, LGBTI persons, certain ethnic and occupational groups, persons who live in “lagging areas,” and especially young people. The report also focuses on the intersectionality of social identity. 
• Is grounded in the experience of African countries but also shows that Africa’s social inclusion challenges are neither unique nor exceptional. 
• Shows the channels through which individuals and economies may incur the costs of social exclusion. The report points out that these costs may be direct or indirect, short or long term. When taken cumulatively, the costs can impede the best efforts of governments and societies. 
• Provides examples of the remarkable innovations that abound in Africa and of the policy and programmatic movement toward social inclusion. The report shines a light on areas in which deeply entrenched norms and practices have changed. 
• Asserts that social inclusion must be a conscious choice for societies and their governments. It must be based on a clear social contract that recognizes both the costs and benefts of policies and interventions that move toward social inclusion. 
What Does Social Inclusion Add to Poverty Reduction? 
Most discussions of social inclusion in Africa have taken place within the context of poverty reduction and in response to humanitarian crises. These discussions are driven by the fact that, despite signifcant progress in decreasing poverty, more than 400 million people are estimated to still live in poverty (Beegle and Christiaensen 2019). Poverty is an outcome; social exclusion is both a process and an outcome. Processes of exclusion can have long-term effects on mind-sets, psyches, and the dignity of subordinate or excluded groups. This exclusion in turn affects the ability of these groups to access the chances given to them. Slavery was one of the most egregious processes of exclusion, as were apartheid 
6 OVERVIEW    
  
 
  
   and untouchability (in South Asia). Less overt practices also can have devastating 
effects on subordinate groups. Consider bullying as an example of an insidious exclusionary process: the world over, some groups are bullied into subjugation. These groups may include lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) people; individuals who may speak with a different accent than the dominant group’s, eat different food, or have other unique characteristics. Bullying can stymie the educational opportunities of those subject to it, cause serious mental health problems and other devastating consequences, and ultimately lead victims to opt out of a system that they perceive as condoning bullying. All this may, and does, occur in an otherwise well-functioning educational system. In other words, victims of bullying may not be affected by poverty but in such cases they are affected by exclusionary practices that prevent them from reaching their full potential. As another example, a person with mobility limitations who is part of rich household is not affected by poverty but may be excluded from doing activities outside the home by inaccessible infrastructure and services. Therefore, it is important to acknowledge that although social exclusion may well have roots in poverty, at times, it does not. Social inclusion adds another dimension to the discourse on poverty and inequality.

and wealth based on a household’s ownership of selected assets, we analyzed data from nine countries: Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Uganda, and Zambia. Looking at the 10 largest ethnic groups in rural and urban areas, we found that ethnicity does indeed matter for wealth outcomes, but that the effects are more pronounced in rural areas than in cities and towns. 
• In all nine countries, certain ethnic groups are overrepresented in the poorest 
wealth quintile. Disparities between ethnic groups are larger in rural areas than in urban areas. 
• Size of the ethnic groups does not seem to matter. This is unsurprising, because across the world, the size of an ethnic group seldom has a linear association with its welfare outcomes. 
• The greatest dispersion along ethnic lines in the poorest quintile in rural areas appears to occur in Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda, followed by lesser dispersion in Mozambique and Zambia. In urban areas, the greatest dispersion is found in Kenya, Mozambique, and South Africa. Although the overrepresentation of some ethnic groups in the lowest wealth quintile is more pronounced in some countries than in others, this may or may not refect absolute gaps in wealth between these groups.

 Asking “who are the poor?” and breaking down the poverty numbers, we fnd 
greater complexity. A case in point is the relationship between gender and poverty, which has a long tradition of analysis. Overall, women are not necessarily poorer than men, nor are male-headed households necessarily better off. Moreover, in many countries in Africa, female-headed households have experienced faster poverty reduction than male-headed households (Milazzo and van de Walle 2017). 
However, more nuanced fndings emerge when we look at gender jointly with age 
and marital status: young married women, but more so those who are young and widowed, are especially vulnerable (Milazzo and van de Walle 2017). Similarly, a recent analysis in Kenya found that compared to men, poverty rates are higher for women who are separated, divorced, or widowed (World Bank 2018c). Yet, older men are on average 8 percentage points poorer than their female counterparts in Africa (Munoz Boudet and others 2018). In addition to gender, other markers such as disability status, race, and ethnicity also matter for poverty. 
Africa Is Striding: Who’s Left Behind? 
Social, economic, and political transformations are sweeping the African continent. We discuss transitions under some broad categories: demographic changes and their relationship to the accumulation of human capital; economic changes, of which poverty reduction is a big part; spatial transitions and their social ramifcations, including urbanization, spatial inequality, and climate change; the growth of technology and 
its implications for social inclusion; and the pervasive nature of confict and fragility, with its implications for a range of outcomes. Finally, we draw attention to the nature of political and civic participation and dynamic social movements. 
Demographic Trends and the Accumulation of Human Capital 
Africa has the fastest population growth in the world, but fertility is falling in 
almost every country. Half of the population in the Region is under 25 years of age; by 2050, the continent will have 362 million young people who are between 15 and 24 years of age (World Bank 2014). Simultaneously, many African countries will see aging of the population: by 2050, Africa’s over-60 population is expected to more than triple, from 69 million in 2017 to 226 million (UN DESA Population Division 2017a). Although youth inclusion is the immediate challenge facing the Region, the inclusion of older cohorts of Africans will soon be a part of the picture. Nevertheless, today Africa’s growing young population has the potential to dramatically drive development and further reduce poverty if the right policies and opportunities are in place. 
As with fertility, Africa has seen improvements in health and longevity, but under-
fve mortality is still high. Children’s survival until age fve is a core indicator of welfare, but also has other ramifcations: for example, high rates of infant and 
8 OVERVIEW   
 
 
     
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
   
 
 
 
 child mortality are associated with higher fertility. Moreover, countries with high 
levels of child mortality are bogged down by the most basic imperative of keeping children alive so are less able to invest in human capital. Based on United Nations (UN) child mortality estimates, according to the Our World in Data project and AfricaInData.org, there has been a sharp decline in child mortality from 1980 to 2015.
2 In fact, compared to other Regions, Africa has seen the fastest decline 
between 1990 and 2016. Despite these improvements, Africa still has the highest under-fve mortality rate, at 78 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2016. In other words, approximately 1 child in 13 still dies before her/his ffth birthday (Suzuki and Kashiwase 2017). There is considerable variation across countries, and fragile states have the highest rates of under-fve mortality. 
In education, too, Africa has made signifcant progress, but, as in other parts of 
the world, there are stark inequalities in educational outcomes based on identity markers. The average primary school gross enrollment ratio in the Region increased from 68 percent in 1990 to 98 percent in 2015, and the number of enrolled students grew from 63 million to 152 million. Nevertheless, despite the increase in primary school enrollment rates, an estimated 52.3 million primary, and lower secondary school-age children (ages 6–14 and 7–15) are out of school, accounting for 45 percent of the world’s out-of-school child population across the world (Bashir and others 2018). Literacy is the most basic educational outcome, yet some people are left out. There is a signifcant gap in literacy between males and females. Western Africa has the highest gender gaps, and Southern Africa has the lowest. 
The overlay of gender with other identity markers confers additional disadvantage 
in education, as it does in other outcomes. Using census data, Taş, Reimão, and Orlando (2014) show that ethnic minority women in Senegal and Sierra Leone suffer cumulative disadvantages in literacy, primary school completion, and secondary school completion. In Senegal, for example, women are 10 percentage points less likely to complete primary school for being female, 1.6 percentage points for being ethnic minority, and an additional 3.8 percentage points for being ethnic minority women. Therefore, cumulatively women of ethnic minority groups are approximately 15.4 percentage points less likely to complete primary school than men belonging to majority ethnic groups in Senegal. In South Africa, despite signifcant progress since the end of apartheid, education outcomes among black and colored South Africans remain low. Although the white population reached close to full attainment of 12 years of education in 1920, the black population has yet to achieve that level today—100 years later—perpetuating the legacy of a racial divide in education in South Africa, which remains a main driver of poverty and inequality (World Bank 2018f, 13). The Benin Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD), similarly, notes that the lack of maternal language teaching in primary school puts indigenous children at a disadvantage and leads them to abandon school prematurely (World Bank 2017b, 57).

 Economic Transitions: Poverty and Employment 
The period since the 1990s has seen an impressive reduction in poverty. However, 
during the same period, absolute numbers of the poor have increased dramatically. Although the poverty head count declined steadily from 57 percent of the African population in 1990 to 41 percent in 2015,
3 the absolute number of people living 
in poverty increased from approximately 278 million to over 413 million. There is signifcant divergence in performance across African countries, driven by several factors, among which fragility, confict, and endowment of natural resources stand out (Beegle and others 2016). 
Spatial Transitions and Social Implications 
Africa’s social geography is changing rapidly. For example, Africa is the fastest 
urbanizing region in the world (fgure 0.2). Approximately 472 million people live in cities and towns—a number that is expected to double over the next 25 years (Lall and others 2017). There are, however, large subregional variations. Most people in North and Southern Africa already live in cities. West Africa is projected to reach an urban majority just after 2020. In contrast, in East Africa, urbanization rates are still below 20 percent (UN-Habitat 2014). Nigeria is among the top three urbanizing countries in the world. Together with India and China, Nigeria is estimated to account for 35 percent of the projected growth of the world’s urban population from 2018 to 2050, adding 189 million urban dwellers (UN DESA Population Division 2019). 
Urbanization holds both prospects and challenges for social inclusion. Migration 
from villages to cities and towns tends to be accompanied by aspirations for a new life; greater social and economic mobility; and increased access to markets, services, and spaces. Migration also often means separation from family and social networks and loneliness for those who do not have networks in their new abodes. A study from South Africa shows that rural-urban migration between 2008 and 2012 was accompanied by an 8.3 percent decrease in the subjective well-being of migrants (Mulcahy and Kollamparambil 2016). Furthermore, because cities often lack careful planning, approximately 60 percent of Africa’s urban population live in informal settlements, compared to 34 percent in other developing countries (UN DESA Statistics Division 2015; cited in Lall and others 2017, 38). Finally, informal workers such as waste pickers, domestic workers, and street vendors experience serious barriers to doing business in most cities. On the other hand, cities often provide a more anonymous space than do rural areas and so enable individuals from excluded groups to escape discrimination and to pursue job and education opportunities that they would not have had in a rural context. Although additional research is needed to understand the mechanisms through which these outcomes obtain, box 0.2 explains that wealth disparities among ethnic groups are less pronounced in urban than in rural areas.

 At the same time, ethnic groups and migrants tend to cluster residentially and 
occupationally in urban areas, with varying effects for social inclusion. 
Although considerable attention is given to Africa’s urban growth and advances 
in service delivery, evidence also exists that location matters and that many areas lag behind. In general, countries and areas that are experiencing confict or 
Box 0.2 Disability in Africa: The Importance of Advocacy, Data, and 
Analysis 
Approximately 15 percent of the world’s population has disabilities. Africans are 
no exception. Yet, intervening on behalf of persons with disabilities requires nuanced understanding of disability and of the ways in which type and intensity of disability, gender, place in the life cycle, location, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, socioeconomic status, and other factors intersect to convey disadvantage or advantage. 
The disability rights movement in Africa arguably is one of the most dynamic 
contemporary social movements in the continent. Using the axiom, “Nothing for us without us,” the movement has infuenced budget allocations and research priorities, raised awareness, and helped reduce the widespread stigma against persons with disabilities. The advocacy movement for albinism also is unfolding before our eyes. 
The importance of data and analysis has benefted from advocacy and, in turn, 
strengthens the hand of advocacy movements. The availability of data in some African countries has enabled an empirical focus on the poorer outcomes for persons who have disabilities. Several studies show that persons with disabilities are more likely to be self-employed in agriculture and less likely to be employees (Hoogeveen 2005; Mitra 2018). There also are variations in employment outcomes across different types and intensities of disability. In a study using data from Ethiopia, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda, Mitra (2018) found the largest gaps in Tanzania. There, 53 percent of persons with severe functional diffculties are employed, compared to 85 percent of persons with no functional diffculty. Poverty outcomes are similarly nuanced: “…while persons with functional diffculties are a disproportionately large share of the poor, not all persons with functional diffculties are poor” (Mitra 2018, 156). 
There also is evidence on lower educational attainment of persons with 
disabilities in Africa (Eide and Mmatli 2016; Filmer 2008; Hoogeveen 2005; Loeb and Eide 2004; Loeb and others 2008; Mitra 2018; Mitra and others 2013; Mizunoya and others 2016). When disability status is combined with gender, we see the real effects of intersectional disadvantage. Outcomes differ further by type of disability, but lack of reliable data presents serious constraints to analysis and action. For instance, data on intellectual disabilities are particularly scarce, as are services for persons with such disabilities.

 fragility have poorer outcomes than do others. Clearly, there are lagging regions within countries, and people who live in such regions may have other defning characteristics, such as belonging to particular ethnic or other groups. Across the world, lagging areas also are those in which people have less voice and political power than in other regions. African countries are no exception. The popular discourse in many African countries makes explicit links between political power and uneven regional development, pointing to the fact that areas with better political connections to those in power tend to fare better. 
Finally, the majority of Africa’s population still lives in rural areas, and there is 
a signifcant rural-urban divide in opportunity. For example, approximately 56 percent of the rural population around the world lack health coverage, compared to 22 percent of the urban population, with the most deprived rural population living in Africa (Scheil-Adlung 2015, 6). Within rural areas, exclusion from health services also may be more severe for women, the elderly, some ethnic groups, and migrants (Scheil-Adlung 2015, 30). In South Africa, despite provision of free antenatal care, nonwhite women and those living in rural areas are less likely to receive antenatal care or to have a skilled attendant present during delivery than white women in urban areas (Burgard 2004; Say and Raine 2007; Silal and others 2012; all cited in World Bank 2013, 95). 
Climate-related transitions are likely to affect many aspects of life globally, and 
certainly in Africa. Extreme weather events destroy infrastructure and affect livelihoods, health, education, and general well-being. These extreme events could reverse many of the gains that African countries have made. Some climate events also contribute to large-scale, involuntary population movements. Africa is expected to host 86 million persons who likely will migrate due to the effects of climate change by 2050 (Rigaud and others 2018). Rapid-onset events such as extreme storms or foods tend to lead to short-term displacement, followed by return to affected areas, although they also can generate a combination of short-and longer-term displacement and out-migration. In contrast, slow-onset events including droughts and desertifcation, such as of the Sahel, tend to lead to gradual, long-term out-migration. Many internal migrants move to major cities so that internal migration is a signifcant contributor to urbanization (Tacoli and others 2015; cited in Rigaud and others 2018, 18). Nairobi is an example of a city likely to see increased climate-driven in-migration. Low-lying cities, along with coastlines vulnerable to sea level rise and areas of high water and agriculture stress, also are at risk of climate-induced out-migration. Addis Ababa and Dar el Salaam are among the cities likely to see dampened population growth due to rising sea level and storm surges (Rigaud and others 2018). As we design programs for adaptation to climate change and mitigation of its impacts, we need to be cognizant that emergencies often exacerbate existing inequalities and asymmetrical power relations and that both prevention and response need to take them into account.

 Box 0.3 The Importance of Place and Peace for Social Inclusion 
Peace is not just the absence of confict; peace is the creation of 
an environment where all can fourish, regardless of race, colour, creed, religion, gender, class, caste, or any other social markers of difference. Religion, ethnicity, language, social and cultural practices are elements which enrich human civilization, adding to the wealth of our diversity.
a 
—Nelson Mandela, 2018 
The congruence of confict and fragility with poorer development outcomes 
is well understood by policy-makers, aid workers, activists, and communities. Individuals and groups who reside in areas prone to, or in the midst of, confict struggle for access to markets, services, and spaces. The least powerful among them sometimes face terrible atrocities. 
Although neither confict nor humanitarian emergencies are exclusively African 
problems or problems that affect only poor and fragile situations, Africa faces some unique challenges. In 2016, Africa saw 3.9 million new internal displacements due to confict, violence, and sudden-onset disasters. Together with the Middle East and North Africa Region, Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) hosts the largest numbers of forcibly displaced groups, with a sharp increase over the past several years. For example, although each of the two regions had approximately 8 million displaced people in 2012, this number increased to 21.5 million in the Middle East and North Africa and 18.4 million in sub-Saharan Africa in 2017. Within sub-Saharan Africa, most forced displacement took place domestically: of the 18.4 million displaced people in 2017, 12.5 million were internally displaced persons (IDPs) and 5.9 percent were refugees (Connor and Krogstad 2018). 
After controlling for other country traits, countries that were rich in natural 
resources had 13 percentage points faster poverty reduction than countries that were not resource rich. Between 1996 and 2012, poverty decline in fragile states was smaller when compared to the decline in nonfragile states in Africa. After controlling for a set of country characteristics, poverty reduction in fragile states was 15 percentage points lower than it was in nonfragile states (Beegle and others 2016). A caveat is in order here. Countries that are endowed with natural resources also can fall prey to the “resource curse,” which can exacerbate fragility and confict, unless institutions are robust enough. 
Confict, the threat of confict, and the pursuant displacement affect both the 
displaced and their host communities. To start, although displacement comes with tremendous suffering, feeing can mitigate the detrimental effects of confict (Etang-Ndip and others 2015), and displaced persons are not always the poorest (Beegle and others 2016). Moreover, host communities are affected by the infow of forced migrants; and in some places, especially in remote and underdeveloped borderlands, the hosts are poorer than the internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees. 
14 OVERVIEW   
 
  
   
  
 
  
 
 
 The effects of displacement on host communities take place through different 
channels. The Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya, for instance, is based in Turkana County, which has a poverty rate of close to 80 percent, compared to the national average of 36 percent (KNBS 2015). In Tanzania, the 1990s infux of refugees from Burundi and Rwanda adversely affected Tanzanian casual laborers due to the increased labor competition and surging prices of various goods. 
Women and young girls in confict-affected areas may have greater exposure 
to sexual violence and may be actively targeted by opposing groups. Evidence from the Great Lakes Region (GLR) shows that female ex-combatants who try to reintegrate in their communities are stigmatized. One underlying cause is their increased exposure to sexual violence during confict. In some parts of the GLR, this stigma is so strong that some female ex-combatants avoid self-identifying as ex-combatants and so forfeit their access to targeted assistance for ex-combatants (Rhea 2014, 28). 
Finally, the effects of climate change may exacerbate inequality and exclusion. 
These effects are pronounced in some areas. When extreme weather events hit areas with high levels of state and societal fragility, the whole population suffers, but some groups are affected more. These groups may include persons with disabilities, young children and the elderly.

Technology Can Spearhead Social Inclusion, but Can Leave Some People 
Further Behind 
Now is the global age of technology, but its benefts to countries, regions, communities, 
and households depend on whether they have access to this potent medium. In many respects, Africa seems to have leapfrogged into the digital economy, but there is great variation across countries. For example, despite a relatively faster increase in mobile cellular subscriptions in fragile countries, the number of mobile cellular subscriptions remains higher in nonfragile countries (Calderon and others 2019, 49). Similarly, fnancial technology (“fntech”) also has expanded across Africa. Twenty-one percent of adults in Africa now have mobile money accounts, with numbers having doubled since 2014, the highest share of any region globally (Demirgüç-Kunt and others 2018). M-PESA is one of the earliest and perhaps most prominent examples of fntech in Africa. Digital technology also can spearhead employment, as the recent World Bank report on the future of work in Africa points out (Choi and others 2019).

 As would be expected, the proportion of individuals who have access to the Internet in each African country is highly correlated with the country’s income level. South Africa is the only African country in which almost 60 percent of the population is online (Pew Research Center 2018b). Furthermore, the Pew Research Center Spring 2017 Global Attitudes Survey in 6 countries showed that males and persons with higher education and higher income levels were more likely to use smartphones (fgure 0.3). This means that nonusers of smartphones are left out of many opportunities to access markets, services, and spaces. 
Political Participation and Social Movements 
Social inclusion often advances when individuals or groups who feel excluded 
assert their agency through social and political participation. The nature of such participation has changed in many African countries. Recent surveys draw attention to declining participation in formal political and civic processes, particularly among youth and women in Africa; but the picture is complex. The likelihood of voting is lower among African youth than among their elders, and data from the Afrobarometer survey suggest that the political participation of young people has declined over the past decade and a half (Lekalake and Gyimah-Boadi 2016). African youth also are less likely than their elders to participate in civic activities. Young women participate even less in public affairs. Compared to their male counterparts, they report signifcantly less interest in public affairs and discussions around them (Lekalake and Gyimah-Boadi 2016). 
Such decreasing participation in formal political processes may signal several 
different things. It may mean disenchantment or lack of faith in the processes. It also may mean that young people use different channels to express their preferences. The importance of social media bears special mention here. The Internet affords anonymity, which allows groups who would otherwise not have a voice to express themselves through digital media. Youth in Africa are far more active on social media and digital platforms than are their elders. The rise of social movements also shows that young people may use other civic channels to act on what they care about. Even so, the likely disenchantment with political processes may be an indication of broader disenchantment with the state. 
Although participation in formal political processes seems to be declining, social 
movements continue to raise the profle of social inclusion across Africa. That Africa has a vibrant history of social and political movements is well known. These include the legendary movements for independence and decolonization, the critical movements in academia against Eurocentrism, and movements for peace and civil liberties and against various economic policies. The 2015/2016 student-led Fees-Must-Fall-movement in South Africa points to the fact that, although young people may not participate in formal political processes, they nevertheless

are  politically  very vibrant. Similarly, the movement that asserts the rights of 
indigenous peoples to their culture, lands, and unique identity also has a strong 
history.  Two contemporary social movements also deserve mention: the frst 
brought attention to HIV/AIDS, and the second to the rights of persons with disabilities.  Each demonstrates that advocacy and public education help to change 
norms and practices. Furthermore, civil society also has galvanized citizens against corruption in several countries in Africa.  In South Africa,  for instance,  
civil society organizations (CSOs) started campaigning against corruption in the late 1990s, which led to the frst anticorruption summit by the government in 1999 and the launch of the National Anti-Corruption Forum in 2001.  The latter 
marshalled civil society, business, and government (Essoungou 2013). In Kenya,

 CSOs mobilized protests (Occupy Parliament) against the salaries of Members 
of Parliament (MPs) and brought about salary cuts of MPs and the president in 2013. Other countries have had similar forms of protest. Finally, radical feminist movements have gathered strength over the years and have organized to hold the state and society accountable for the poorer opportunities for girls and women. 
How Does Social Exclusion Play Out in Africa? 
Fundamentally, social exclusion is about power relationships. The world over, societies devise intricate ways to solidify social structures and uphold the status quo. Attitudes, beliefs, perceptions, and practices, including superstitions, stigmas, and rituals, are among the processes through which societies assign some groups to subordinate, and others to dominant, status. Structures and systems comprise, among others, families, communities, legal systems, labor, land markets, and knowledge systems. It is also important to note that structures and processes reinforce one another and are solidifed by formal and informal institutions. 
Across the world, belief systems, superstitions, stigmas, and other practices bar the 
inclusion of specifc groups. Intimidation and harassment instill fear that prevents some groups from reaching their full potential and “keeps them in their place.” Social norms may assign males and females to particular occupations or may render some practices (or bodily functions) “unclean.” Other practices such as stigma and shunning may render invisible groups such as persons with disabilities or persons with albinism. Relatedly, some cultures may hide persons with disabilities. This lack of visibility can have several consequences, including not counting these groups in offcial statistics. Thus, they remain hidden and unattended to at both the familial and the national levels. Often, these exclusionary practices are sanctifed by religion or by those who interpret religious texts. In many cultures, persons who have a nonconforming sexual identity are excluded to the point of being criminalized. Excluding and criminalizing them often is upheld invoking religious texts. Taboos surrounding menstruating women are common in many parts of the world; beliefs about purity and pollution exclude certain groups at certain times or at all times. Overall, these practices are mechanisms to enforce social order and control. 
Why do processes and practices matter for policies and programs? They matter 
because they affect the actions and behaviors of dominant and subordinate groups, of service providers, and of the state itself. For their part, groups who historically are excluded may respond in different ways. One possibility is that they “opt out” or reject the terms on which they are included. Excluded groups may drop out of school or the labor market or disengage from political processes. A second, related possibility is that grievances may accumulate, creating social tensions and having long-term effects on the economy and society. A third possibility is that 
18 OVERVIEW   
  
 
 
   
 
 
 groups who feel excluded organize themselves into formidable lobbies and use 
the political space to demand change. Processes and structures have strong effects on feelings and perceptions of individuals and groups. In our quest to leave no one behind, attain universal access, and eradicate extreme poverty, we need to be cognizant of behavior, which is the frst step to lasting change. Yet, even as we know that belief systems, feelings, and perceptions affect behaviors, measuring and interpreting such systems and the underlying affective foundations is a complex undertaking that requires a deep understanding of the context as well as robust data and analytic tools. 
Violence is one of the gravest manifestations of exclusion and a mechanism to 
show subordinate groups “their place.” Physical offensives often are justifed by an intricate set of beliefs and taboos that serve to create a “logic of exclusion,” which may be sanctifed by religion. For example, many religions regard a woman’s place as being in the home and may implicitly condone violence against women who dare to transgress this norm. Overall, the acceptance of domestic violence against women remains high in Africa, although acceptance has decreased over time. Beegle and others (2016) fnd that, between 2000-2006 and 2007-2013, acceptance of domestic violence by women in Africa declined by almost 10 percentage points. Nevertheless, at 30 percent, acceptance of domestic violence in the Region is still exceptionally high. There is considerable heterogeneity across countries, however. Some practices, such as female genital mutilation (FGM), which hold cultural value for some groups, also are examples of violence and extreme symbols of exclusion and have devastating effects on health, education, and life chances. FGM can have direct effects on reproductive and mental health and cause infectious disease. Sanctifed and upheld by religion and culture, FGM serves to solidify the subordinate status of women and girls. 
Culture plays a central role in the political, economic and social 
life of communities. Indeed, culture may be the missing link in the development of Africa. Culture is dynamic and evolves over time, consciously discarding retrogressive traditions, female genital mutilation (FGM), and embracing aspects that are good and useful.

Attitudes, perceptions, and feelings can point to the extent to which people feel 
included in markets, services, and spaces. Belonging to an ethnic group can create affnity and comfort among members. In the same vein, expressing affnity with a national identity is an indication that respondents feel connected to their country. The Afrobarometer 2014/2015 asked respondents who disclosed their ethnic identity at the beginning of the survey whether they regarded their national or their ethnic identity as more important. The results are instructive: only a small

 minority of respondents appeared to give precedence to their ethnic identity alone. 
Feelings of national or ethnic identity may be driven by several factors related to the extent of pluralism or of competition in society, the history of the nation-state or of confict, and the current political milieu. These questions also could elicit socially or politically acceptable responses so they should not be taken as “truths” and must be interpreted with caution. 
In many parts of Africa, negative feelings about the state are widespread. 
This disaffection is apparent in newspaper columns, social media, and casual conversations. Disaffection also is refected in perception surveys. The Afrobarometer 2014/2015 asked respondents how often they feel that people in their country are being treated unequally “under the law” (that is, by the state). Their answers likely indicate grievances and feelings of injustice and exclusion. Figure 0.4 presents the results. There are, as expected, large variations across African countries. Botswana and Namibia stand out as countries in which almost 60 percent of the respondents felt that people were never or rarely treated unequally under the law. In Malawi, Mauritius, and Tanzania, approximately 50 percent of respondents felt that unequal treatment under the law was never or rarely manifested. At the other end of the spectrum, in Mali and São Tomé and Príncipe, over half the respondents felt that unequal treatment under the law was always manifested. Overall, in most countries, more than half the respondents felt that people were often or always treated unequally under the law. 
When the majority of citizens feel that people in their country are treated unequally, 
it often points to elite capture. In other words, the state is perceived as catering to the needs of a small section of society. In this circumstance, exclusion is not a minority issue but affects many or most citizens. Several recent World Bank Systematic Country Diagnostics (SCDs) in Africa identify elite capture and a lack of public trust as important obstacles to the delivery of inclusive services and a stable social contract more broadly. See, for example, SCDs for Benin (World Bank 2017b), Guinea-Bissau (World Bank 2016), Liberia (World Bank 2018e), and Madagascar (World Bank 2015). Other surveys and anecdotal evidence also point to perceptions that the state and its institutions are opaque and that they beneft only a few. A perception survey conducted by the Pew Research Center found that 64 percent of Kenyans, 63 percent of Nigerians, and 69 percent of South Africans surveyed felt that many jobs go to people with connections (Wike and others 2016). 
Emerging evidence shows that, despite serious misgivings about their economies 
and often about their governments, people living in several African countries have high levels of optimism. For instance, as part of the Pew Research Center Spring 2017 Global Attitudes Survey, roughly half of the Africans (median of 49 percent) and Latin Americans (48 percent) surveyed said their day was “particularly good,” whereas other regions overwhelmingly described their day as “typical.”

 Similarly, based on Afrobarometer data, Graham and Hoover (2006) found levels 
of optimism in Africa that surpassed other regions. The levels of optimism were particularly high among the poorest and most insecure respondents, who had high hopes for the future of their children. In keeping with this fnding, the Liberia SCD (World Bank 2018e, 72) cites a 2014 survey that found that most Liberians believe their country is headed in the right direction, driven in part by Liberia’s return to relative peace and stability. 
Social Inclusion Can Be Achieved If It Is a Conscious 
Choice for Societies 
Social inclusion is important because exclusion impedes the ability, opportunity, 
and dignity of some individuals and groups and is costly to societies and economies. Nevertheless, measuring the costs of social exclusion is no mean undertaking. When assessing the cost of exclusion, some estimates focus on specifc groups. These groups include women, persons with disabilities, ethnic or racial groups, individuals in same-sex relations, and migrants. This report lays out some of the channels and levels through which costs are obtained. Costs can be surmised at the level of the individual, the household, the group, or the community. Costs also may be estimated at local, subnational, and national levels. The costs of social exclusion may be direct or indirect, short term or long term. The cumulative long-term costs can be signifcant and can affect the growth trajectories of entire economies. For example, lower earnings or employment outcomes at the individual level may be driven by lower human capital endowments, which in turn may be caused by prior disadvantage in education or by discrimination in hiring or in the workplace (for example, Buckup 2009; Lamichhane and Sawada 2013; Morgon Banks and Polack 2015). The experience of exclusion can have physical and mental health costs at the individual, household, group, and, ultimately, national level (for example, Lereya and others 2015). Finally, foregone benefts also can be costly. Hunt and others (2015) and Hunt and others (2018) fnd that companies in the top quartile for gender, racial, and ethnic diversity are 15 percent to 35 percent more likely to have fnancial returns above national industry medians. Gains from the inclusion of excluded groups occur not only from adding workers to the labor force; diversity itself may increase productivity (Ostry and others 2018). 
Ultimately, social inclusion must be a conscious choice of societies and 
governments, made with a clear understanding of the costs and benefts. Investing in an inclusive society is not free and needs concerted action to transform the investment into a win-win. Social programs, for instance, can be expensive and impact fscal sustainability. Governments often need to make trade-offs, either by cutting costs on other initiatives or by raising taxes. There may be political costs as well because initiatives that focus on historically excluded groups can upset power relations. Governments and politicians need to craft clear social contracts

 with citizens to ensure support for social inclusion. There are examples the world over of citizens willing to pay for a more inclusive society. The most powerful form of support is through the fscal realm, whereby citizens pay taxes that they know will fund policies and programs for greater social inclusion. For instance, in Brazil, Mexico, and Nepal, there is strong support for social protection programs. In Bangladesh, poverty reduction is recognized as a national priority, with the elite supporting antipoverty initiatives (Hossain and Moore 2002). Tentative evidence from Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda shows that attitudes toward redistribution may be favorable overall (Langer and others 2016). 
Change toward Social Inclusion Is within Reach 
How does change take place? Who are the main actors? What are the channels through which progress toward social inclusion is achieved? What can we learn for the future and for the countries that want to make greater progress? We draw from the World Bank’s social inclusion framework (World Bank 2013) and address inclusion in markets, services, and spaces. Inclusion how? Here we repeat 
what we have said earlier in this report: by raising the ability, opportunity, and dignity of individuals and groups most likely to be left out. This report outlines some of the policy and program efforts being made by African countries to pursue social inclusion. Sometimes, documenting process helps others in their quest to design workable solutions. Therefore, we focus on some innovations and generic solutions that African countries have tried. 
There are other important drivers of change toward social inclusion in 
Africa, as elsewhere. These include a host of nonstate actors: religious groups, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), the private sector, and, most importantly, organizations of historically subordinated groups. Lasting change usually comes when state and nonstate actors join forces. Elites often are part of both state and nonstate actions and play a critical role in propelling social inclusion. The importance of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in many parts of the continent presents an interesting case in point. What started as attention to a public health emergency quickly moved to identify affected groups. These included gay and bisexual men, men who have sex with men (MSM), widows, and orphans. This attention to sexual orientation in many African countries was legitimized because it was linked to a public health crisis, and groups previously invisible were rendered visible. This is not to say that stigma no longer exists, and sometimes the stigma may only have changed its form. Nevertheless, the epidemic was a catalyst. It presented an opportunity that enabled previously excluded groups to mobilize and be partners in the change that policy and programs propelled. Through attacking the epidemic, governments and civil society co-opted elites and community members alike. Innovative methods of using information and communication technology (ICT) to solicit anonymous responses to questions have become increasingly popular. Such 
INCLUSION MATTERS IN AFRICA 23   
 
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
 
 
 technology also can be used to amplify voice. In Tanzania and South Sudan, two pilot initiatives referred to as “Listening to Africa” have been highly successful in collecting panel data through mobile phone interviews. 
Regardless of which actor sponsors a program that is intended to promote social 
inclusion, few programs can succeed without community ownership. Communities who own the movement toward social inclusion and can visualize a new society for themselves are most likely to be invested in the success of such programs. Conversely, when programs are designed without community involvement, they may take longer to take off and even face resistance from the community. Abolishing FGM in Burkina Faso is illustrative. Together with criminalizing the practice in 1997, the government implemented a broad array of measures that promoted community ownership of the change. In addition to training lawyers, judges, police, and security offcers to ensure their buy-in, the government supported “community patrols,” who raised awareness of the harmful consequences of FGM and informed communities of its criminalization. 
Most countries in Africa, as elsewhere, have a plethora of policies, programs, and 
projects to advance social inclusion. These policies may be targeted at certain groups or areas; or they may be universal, accessible to everyone. At the highest level, the constitutions of most countries guarantee equality and basic freedoms. Laws are the next level of actions that promote change; they can be progressive or regressive. Box 0.4 shows that Africa has made the world’s fastest progress in enacting laws that promote gender equality. Broad-vision documents, manifestos, and pronouncements give a more defned indication of a government’s priorities. Still lower down are policies, which lay out directives and show the clearer path of a government’s focus on social inclusion. Many policies signal the groups whom they privilege or ignore by their silence on certain topics or groups or by the intensity of implementation of certain policies. Thus, although policies may 
Box 0.4 Legal Reform for Women in Africa 
Africa has implemented the most reforms promoting gender equality of any 
region globally: 71 reforms over the last 10 years. Most of these reforms (over 50 percent) concerned laws affecting gender-based violence. Burundi, the Comoros, Rwanda, São Tomé and Príncipe, and Zambia all introduced laws that addressed both workplace sexual harassment and domestic violence. Among the top reforming economies in the Region over the past decade are the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Guinea, Malawi, Mauritius, São Tomé and Príncipe, and Zambia (fgure B 0.4.1).

The Democratic Republic of Congo saw the largest increase in its Women, 
Business and the Law index (from 42.5 in 2009 to 70.0 in 2018). Improvements 
in DRC were based on reforms allowing married women to register businesses, open bank accounts, sign contracts, get jobs, and choose where to live in the same ways that men do. The legal requirement for wives to obey their husbands was removed, as were restrictions on women working in specifc industries such as mining, manufacturing, and construction. DRC also introduced gender nondiscrimination laws in employment and access to credit. 
Mauritius  began reforms in 2008 by introducing civil remedies for sexual  
harassment at work, prohibiting the dismissal of pregnant workers, introducing  
paid paternity leave, and prohibiting discrimination in access to credit based  
on gender. The government mandated equal remuneration for work of equal  
value in 2013 and increased the length of paid maternity leave from 12 to 14  
weeks in 2015. Due to these reforms, Mauritius’ score increased by 16.88 points:  
between 2009 and 2018, the female labor force participation rate went up by  
6.82 percent relative to men’s. São Tomé and Príncipe introduced a domestic violence law in 2009; 
implemented a workplace sexual harassment law that included criminal penalties in 2012; and reformed its retirement laws for men and women to entitlement to full pension benefts and making the mandatory retirement age for men and women equal in 2014. Between 2009 and 2018, female labor force participation increased by 1.75 percent relative to that of men.

  not actively exclude individuals or groups, they may passively do so, either by 
not expressly indicating who is included or by not investing adequate resources or attention to implementation.
4 Some examples of policies and programs are 
presented in table 0.1. 
Well-designed and implemented programs across the globe have changed the face 
of social exclusion. Of these, social safety nets have a track record of historically shielding households from the negative effects of shocks and, more recently, of building household and community assets. Such programs started in Africa in response to food crises and humanitarian emergencies and still complement emergency responses to crises or shocks, consequently reducing the cost and increasing the effectiveness of humanitarian actions. Social safety nets often provide ready vehicles through which to intervene in crises. In response to the Ebola emergency, governments leveraged the existing modest programs and scaled up cash transfers and public works programs (Beegle and others 2018, 67). Over time, Africa has become a leader in the design and delivery of social safety nets. Every country in the Region has at least one social safety net program. A broad array of programs, loosely classifed as “empowerment programs,” often are targeted to historically excluded groups and can have large positive impacts. In Uganda, the Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents (ELA) program was developed and implemented by Building Resources Across Communities (BRAC) to provide training for small-scale enterprises and education for health and reduction of risky behaviors. The Sahel Women Empowerment and Demographic Dividend (SWEDD) project, which spans Burkina Faso, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger, has used several innovations to attain its objective of empowering women and adolescent girls through access to quality reproductive and child and maternal health services and working with local partners to improve their capacities. The project has garnered the support of religious leaders on child marriage, maternal and child health, family planning, girls’ education, gender-based violence, and women’s economic and social empowerment. In yet another initiative, the project gives bicycles, school kits, and sanitary kits to girls. The project also organizes coaching classes in select areas so that girls can keep up in school and trains young women in nontraditional trades. 
Another way of focusing on specifc individuals or groups is through affrmative 
action or quotas. Special provisions for individuals and groups are common in OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) and non-OECD countries alike. Although sometimes controversial, especially in the context of stubborn group-based inequalities, affrmative action policies still are considered among the more effective policy mechanisms (Langer and others 2016). Many African countries have affrmative action policies for women and persons with disabilities. Uganda enshrined a quota system for Parliament in the 1995 Constitution (Article 78) stating that Parliament should include a woman 
26 OVERVIEW   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 representative in every district, as well as representatives from the army, 
youth, workers, persons with disabilities, and “other groups as Parliament may defne.” Similar provisions were made to ensure seats for women in local government (Muriaas and Wang 2012, 311). South Africa, of course, has the most prominent and comprehensive set of initiatives. 
The changing development context of the continent, as demonstrated by 
select regional trends, portends new opportunities and challenges for African countries over the next few decades. First, the decline of poverty almost across the board, the enhancement of education, and the improvements in health have meant (and increasingly will mean) that policy-makers need to focus on those who have not benefted from this aggregate progress. Of these, people who are affected by confict and fragility stand out, but some groups in nonfragile contexts also are at risk of being left out. These include some categories of women, sexual and gender minorities, persons with disabilities, older persons, some categories of youth and children, certain ethnic and racial groups, and those who live in “lagging” regions. Some of these groups are more assertive; others may have festering grievances. 
Second, development spearheads aspiration. As individuals and groups 
do better, they will seek more. This has implications for how governments respond to these heightened aspirations. The report shows that citizens in many countries in Africa are simultaneously disenchanted with the state and flled with optimism and hope for better lives. As more countries graduate to middle-income status, they will focus on “second-generation” issues of prosperity. In the years ahead, the trends and transitions that shape and tame Africa’s dynamism are likely to have signifcant implications for social inclusion. Although a focus on poverty must be front and center in addressing social inclusion issues, states and societies also will need to consider the drivers of poverty and why  some groups are left out. 
Africa has made enormous progress toward economic development and social inclusion, but it needs to do much more. Indeed, there are several areas in which some of the fastest progress globally is in African countries. However, as the World Bank (2013) points out, social inclusion is not a linear process. Progress can stall for unanticipated reasons, but it may pick up again. Groups who once were disempowered may gain power and may upstage earlier dominant groups, who in turn may work to impede progress toward social inclusion because it hurts their interests. Social inclusion is always work in progress (World Bank 2013).

 The Motivation and 
Conceptual Clarity 
Africa is increasingly recognized for its dynamism, its innovation 
and for social change. The idea of the “African Century” has pervaded national and international policy and advocacy circles. Across Africa there have been impressive gains in health, nutrition, education, and women’s empowerment. Innovation, which abounds in Africa, is refected in a plethora of areas: the spread of digital technology, advocacy movements that bring previously ostracized and invisible persons into public view, and social enterprises and fresh answers to intractable questions. As incubation hubs that create solutions to stubborn challenges, African countries are the arena in which global development challenges will play out and likely be overcome.

 Nevertheless, positive developments and prosperity have left some individuals and groups behind; a reality across the world, in OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) and non-OECD countries alike. This realization led to the formulation of the idea of social exclusion and its converse, inclusion, which has taken different forms across varied regions. In Europe, social inclusion has been associated largely with the job market, homelessness, and chronic poverty, with an increasing focus on ethnicity and migrant status. In Latin America, indigenous identity, race, disability status, and sexual identity have grown to prominence in national discourses. In South Asia, caste, ethnicity, religion, and disability status are key axes of exclusion. In Africa, most discussions of social inclusion have taken place within the context of poverty reduction and in response to humanitarian crises. These conversations are driven by the fact that despite signifcant progress in decreasing poverty, more than 400 million people are estimated to still live in poverty (Beegle and Christiaensen 2019). As in other places, in Africa, “the poor” is a heterogenous category. Some groups tend to be overrepresented or underrepresented among them, and they systematically lack access to markets, services, and spaces. These groups have a weaker voice when it comes to asserting their needs with governments and elites. They often live in areas of confict and fragility. It behooves us to ask: Who are these groups? Are they being left out of peace and prosperity? If so, why? Answers to these questions can signifcantly aid programs and policies intended to reduce poverty and boost human capital accumulation. 
Additional motivation for a spotlight on social inclusion is embedded in four related 
developments in the global policy arena. First, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with their philosophy of leaving no one behind have permeated the policy space. Second, the WBG’s focus on ending extreme poverty, combined with its twin goal of boosting shared prosperity, has moved the policy conversation to issues that go beyond poverty. Third, the World Bank’s fagship report on social inclusion, Inclusion Matters (World Bank 2013), has infuenced the global conversation, and, although attribution is not clear, funding agencies have increasingly focused their grantmaking on issues of social inclusion, using language from the report. Last, the idea of social inclusion has pride of place in the new World Bank Environmental and Social Framework (ESF) that has applied to WBG projects since October 2018 (appendix B). The ESF defnes social sustainability squarely in terms of social inclusion, stating that “social development and inclusion are critical for all of the World Bank’s development interventions and for achieving sustainable development.” It further states that “inclusion…embraces action to remove barriers against those who often are excluded from the development process, such as women, children, persons with disabilities, youth and minorities, and to ensure that the voice of all can be heard” (World Bank 2017d, 1).

 Box 1.1 World Bank Regional Strategy for Africa 
• Empowering women to change fertility dynamics and accelerate human 
capital gains: Through the new Human Capital Project (HCP) the World 
Bank Group is committed to investing more and better in people. 
• Accelerating Africa’s digital economy: With digital economy investments and reforms, Africa may be able to accelerate, possibly even leapfrog the traditional growth model, and transition from an agriculture-based economy to a digital economy, while building core infrastructure, systems, and competencies. 
• Climate change: In the face of increasing climate- related risks, investing in climate change adaptation and resilience mechanisms and disaster risk management will remain a top priority. 
• Regional integration: Regional integration in Africa remains a critical 
emphasis of the WBG regional strategy to improve connectivity, leverage economies of scale, and facilitate collective action by countries to address shared challenges. 
• Maximizing fnance for development: At a time when public resources are increasingly scarce and the aspirations of African populations are rising, WBG has embraced the Maximizing Finance for Development approach to systematically leverage all sources of finance, expertise, and solutions that will help create an enabling environment for investors, particularly those in the private sector. 
• Boosting resilience to confict and violence: With violent conflict surging, 
the fight to end extreme poverty in Africa will require a stronger focus on addressing the underlying drivers of fragility to create opportunities for peace and shared prosperity. 
• Knowledge: Knowledge is essential to our effort to improve development 
outcomes and make aid more effective.

Finally, the Africa Region of the World Bank announced its new strategy, which 
is rooted in the tenets of social inclusion. The strategy is outlined in box 1.1. Much of this report directly or indirectly addresses the issues that have been raised in the Africa Regional strategy. The contribution of this report will be in its application of the social inclusion framework to the problems articulated in the strategy and its identifcation of the underlying structures and processes that exacerbate social exclusion.

 What Do We Mean by Social Inclusion? 
The prolifc use of “social inclusion” (or just “inclusion”) as a framing construct over the last decade has been somewhat of a double-edged sword so it is important to defne what we mean. Essentially, the usage “social inclusion” and its variants seems to have “become a catch-all…for any positive welfare outcome—from poverty to equality to better education, health, housing, transport, among others.” (Das 2016). Yet, users of the term seem to want to convey something that is different from, or more than, poverty or inequality reduction or better human capital outcomes. Although this prolifc use points to a new and broader lexicon in global development, the usage is fraught with lack of conceptual and policy clarity. This report draws its conceptual foundation from the World Bank (2013) (fgure 1.1). We defne social inclusion as the process of improving the terms for individuals and groups to take part in society. An expanded defnition takes into 
account how and for whom the terms of social inclusion can be improved: the process of improving the ability, opportunity, and dignity of people disadvantaged on the basis of their identity to take part in society. In answer to the question “inclusion in what?”World Bank (2013) answers: in markets, services, and spaces. 
Markets comprise land, housing, labor, and credit; and services include education, health, transport, water, social protection, electricity, information, communication, and technology. Spaces include physical space but also spaces in a broader sense: 
social, political, and cultural spaces may solidify exclusion or foster inclusion. Moreover, social inclusion works to enhance the ability, opportunity, and dignity of individuals and groups to take part in society. Of particular signifcance is dignity. When compromised, it can have severe and unexpected consequences for individuals, groups, and the society and economy. 
It is clear from the defnition of social inclusion that disadvantage based on social 
identity is salient. Although such salience can be political and controversial, its acknowledgment is important to advance social inclusion. Social identity may be derived from gender, age, location, occupation, race, ethnicity, religion, citizenship status, disability, and sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) (fgure 1.2). Even so, no single identity really describes an individual. The context determines the identity that assumes dominance at different times (such as place in the life cycle) and in various places (such as the public or the private sphere). Even more important, the real advantage or disadvantage is bestowed by the intersection of identities. 
To close this initial discussion about the importance of social identity, we quote 
Sen (2008), who emphasizes the importance of the “non-economic characteristics” that often drive outcomes.

 Note: Size or placement of shape does not refect importance of identity. 
Purely economic measures of inequality, such as the Gini coeffcient or the ratio of incomes of top and bottom groups, do not bring out the social dimensions of the disparity involved. For example, when the people in the bottom income groups also have different non- economic characteristics, in terms of race (such as being black rather than white), or in immigration status (such as being recent arrivals rather than older residents), then the signifcance of the economic inequality is substantially magnifed by its “coupling” with other divisions, linked to non-economic identity groups. It would be hard, for instance, to have an adequate understanding of the turmoil in the suburbs of Paris and other French cities in the autumn of 2005 only in terms of poverty and deprivation, without bringing in race and immigration. It would be similarly unsatisfactory to try to base a causal explanation only on race and immigration, without bringing in inequality and economic disparity.

 What Does Social Inclusion Add to Poverty Reduction? 
As noted earlier, Africa’s development narrative has been inexorably about poverty reduction. Why do we bring social inclusion into it? The reason is that, although social inclusion is intrinsic to poverty reduction, it also is distinct from it. Poverty is an outcome; social exclusion is both a process and an outcome (World Bank 2013). Processes of exclusion can have long-term effects on the collective dignity, mind-sets, and psyches of subordinated or excluded groups. Exclusion, in turn, affects the ability of groups to access the opportunities that are made available to them. Slavery was one of the most egregious processes of exclusion, as were apartheid and untouchability (in South Asia). 
Less overt practices also can have devastating effects on subordinated groups. 
Consider bullying as an example of an insidious exclusionary process: the world over, some students are bullied into failure. They may include lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) people, or those students who speak with a different accent than that of the dominant groups, may eat different food, or have other unique characteristics. Bullying can stymie the educational opportunities of those subject to it, cause serious mental health and other devastating consequences, and ultimately can lead victims to opt out of a system that they perceive as condoning bullying. All this may, and does, occur in otherwise well-functioning educational systems.Thus, victims of bullying are affected by a process of exclusion that prevents them from reaching their full potential. 
This report emphasizes that poverty is deeply rooted, with causes that may be both 
social and economic, to the vast detriment of peoples and countries. A focus on social inclusion helps promote a better understanding of poverty and attention to those groups most at risk of being left out. It also is important to acknowledge that although social exclusion may well be related to poverty, there are times when it is not. A person with mobility limitations, who is part of rich household and is not affected by poverty, may be excluded if without accessible infrastructure and services are not available. Social inclusion therefore adds to the discourse on poverty and inequality when unpacking the causes and drivers of the hardship of certain individuals and groups. In other words, it adds granularity to poverty analysis. 
Finally, social exclusion is sometimes said in the same breath as “vulnerability,” 
but the two are not the same. The latter focuses on identifying those at risk of a shock, such as falling into poverty or being affected by disaster. There are certainly synergies between vulnerability and social exclusion, insofar as both emphasize underlying processes that contribute to persistent poverty. Often, the same groups who are at risk of exclusion also are among the most vulnerable; they also have the least wherewithal to cope with shocks. They include, for instance, persons with disabilities, orphans, HIV- positive persons, the elderly, ethnic minorities, indigenous peoples (IPs), and widows (Hoogeeven and others 2004). However, 
INCLUSION MATTERS IN AFRICA 43   
 
 
  not all groups who are vulnerable to extreme weather events, to violent attacks, 
or even to poverty are necessarily excluded. For example, people living in seismic zones all are vulnerable, but only some of them may be excluded. The majority of households who reside in fragile ecological zones may be vulnerable to poverty, but, within these households, some individuals may be excluded and others not. Finally, social inclusion is distinct from equality of opportunity. It 
“…takes the idea of equality of opportunity further. It argues that 
both ‘supply of opportunity’ and ‘demand for opportunity’ may be constrained by identity. Getting to full or effective opportunity is not only an institutional challenge in many countries, but the process of expanding opportunities can itself be exclusionary” 
—World Bank 2013 
A social inclusion lens, therefore, emphasizes the importance of addressing 
heterogeneity across groups and pinpointing whether some individuals or groups may be especially disadvantaged due to an identity marker. For a more in-depth discussion of conceptual issues, see World Bank (2013).

 Costs of Social Exclusion: What Are the Channels? 
Social inclusion is important because exclusion impedes the ability, opportunity, 
and dignity of some individuals and groups. It also is important because exclusion is costly to societies and economies. But measuring the costs of social exclusion is no mean undertaking. In this section, we review the literature that gives pointers to the many ways in which such costs can be quantifed. Some studies focus on specifc groups when assessing the cost of exclusion; these groups may include women, persons with disabilities, ethnic or racial groups, people in same-sex relations, and migrants. We highlight the channels through which exclusion affects individuals and society at large. A synthesis of the channels is laid out in table 1.1. 
The costs of social exclusion can accrue through different channels and levels; 
they may be direct or indirect, short term or long term. The cumulative long-term costs can be signifcant and can affect the growth trajectories of entire economies. It is most common to fnd calculations at the individual and the national levels, but there may be intermediate levels as well (such as household, community, or subnational). At the individual level, the loss of wages, lifetime earnings, poor education, and employment outcomes are the commonest measures of costs. For instance, Buehren and others (2019), based on an analysis of Ethiopia, show that women lag men by 36 percent in agricultural productivity, by 79 percent in business sales, and by 44 percent in hourly wages (see also Lamichhane and Sawada 2013 and Male and Wodon 2017 on people with disabilities; Sprague and others 2011 on people with HIV; Turner 2013 on racial minorities in the United States; Wodon and others 2018 and Wodon and de la Brière 2018 on gender; and World Bank 2014 on youth employment in Africa). 
Drivers of lower earnings or employment outcomes may be lower human capital 
endowments, which in turn may be caused by prior disadvantage in education but also by discrimination in hiring or in the workplace (Buckup 2009; Lamichhane and Sawada 2013; Morgon Banks and Polack 2015). As noted, social exclusion often is solidifed through discrimination and its manifestations. Discrimination can have physical and mental health costs for individuals and households, and, ultimately, national level costs (see, for example, Lereya and others 2015).

MARKETS 
Labor market · Members of subordinated groups 
who drop out of the labor market 
or take up jobs for which they may be overqualifed because of discrimination in hiring, wages, and promotion; or the expectation that the labor market will discriminate. 
· Women, sexual minorities, and other 
excluded groups who feel unsafe in jobs because of harassment and lack of safety. 
· Laws that forbid women from 
participating in some types of work or laws that indirectly compel women to take up lower paid work (for example some tax laws). 
· Workers with disabilities who do 
not get basic accommodations such as accessible buildings, toilets, or information. · Losses in productivity, 
innovation, and entrepreneurship. 
Land, water, and other natural resources · Individuals who are landless also 
lack status and power, which makes them less likely to participate in other markets, services, and spaces. 
· Land is collateral and so is linked 
to credit markets. Those who do not own land may not get loans for housing or business. 
· Ownership of land can enhance 
women’s voices, including against domestic violence. 
· Land and other natural resources 
are the bases for employment and livelihoods in economies with a large agrarian base. 
· Those with poor access to water are 
more likely to live in remote and fragile locations and be poorer, and less likely to own land. 
· Mineral resources may be located 
on lands inhabited by poorer or indigenous communities. They may lack voice and power to assert their collective rights on mineral revenues or on sharing benefts from other natural resources. 
· Elite capture of natural resources is 
common in many parts of the world. · Accumulated grievances 
among those who have been left out of land and other natural resources lead to social tensions and confict that can have long-term social and economic costs. 
· Costs of elite capture 
include resistance to reform by elites, with likely ineffciencies as well as political costs to state and society.

 Research on mental health in Africa is growing, and some estimates suggest high 
costs of mental health disorders. In 2015 the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 17.9 million years of healthy life in Africa were lost to mental health disabilities (Sankoh and others 2018). Persons with mental health problems also are often subject to discrimination and exclusion. 
At the national level, the economic costs of social exclusion can be captured by 
forgone GDP and human capital wealth. Exclusion, or the perception of exclusion, may cause certain groups to opt out of markets, services, and spaces, with costs to both individuals and the economy. For instance, when groups opt out of health services, both the groups and the economy incur the high costs of emergency treatment in lieu of more effcient preventive and in-time care (FRA 2015; Mbonu and others 2009). Those who opt out of education and the labor market or have lower aspirations for what they can achieve lose potential income; their employers lose productivity; and the country loses GDP. In the United States, Burns (2012) estimates the cost of exclusion of LGBTI people alone at $64 billion per year. A recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) paper shows that the current gender gap in the labor force costs countries that rank in the bottom half of gender inequality approximately 35 percent of GDP (Ostry and others 2018). Wodon and de la Brière (2018) estimate that, in 2014, Africa lost $2.5 trillion in human capital due to gender inequality and 11.4 percent of total wealth. 
We also can draw some lessons from studies that have quantifed the economic 
cost of inequality. Berg and Ostry (2011) demonstrate that inequality is costly for medium and long-term growth. Some estimates show that in countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Italy overall economic growth would have been 6 to 9 percentage points higher in the past two decades if income inequality had not risen (Stiglitz 2016). Closely related are studies on inequality of opportunity driven by differences at birth, such as gender, ethnicity, or parental background. Inequality of opportunity has been arguably particularly detrimental to growth (for example, Ferreira and others 2014; Marrero and Rodriguez 2013; World Bank and Oxford University Press 2006; and for Africa, Brunori and others 2016). Finally, although exclusion is not tantamount to confict, accumulated grievances due to exclusion may trigger social tensions. The World Bank (2018b) argues that confict countries experience 2.0 percent to 8.4 percent of annual GDP loss; and that countries bordering confict zones suffer a 1.4 percent decline in annual GDP and a 1.7 percent rise in infation. 
Forgone benefts also can be costly. Hunt and others (2015, 2018) fnd that 
companies in the top quartile for gender, racial, and ethnic diversity are 15 percent to 35 percent more likely to have fnancial returns above their national industry medians. Productivity gains from the inclusion of excluded groups occur due not only to the additional workers but also to diversity itself (Ostry 
50 CHAPTER 1 THE MOTIVATION AND CONCEPTUAL CLARITY    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 and others 2018). Hsieh and others (2013) attribute 25 percent of the increase 
of productivity in the United States between 1960 and 2010 to the improved allocation of talent in the labor market thanks to the reduction of discrimination against women and blacks. (See also Cavalcanti and Tavares 2015 for estimates of the cost of gender discrimination.) 
Ultimately, social inclusion must be a conscious choice of societies and 
governments, made with a clear understanding of the costs and benefts. Because investing in an inclusive society is not free, to transform the investment into a win-win requires concerted action. Social programs, for instance, can be expensive and impact fscal sustainability. Governments often must make trade-offs, either by cutting costs on other initiatives or by raising taxes. There may be political costs as well because initiatives that focus on historically excluded groups can upset power relations. Governments and politicians must craft clear social contracts with citizens to ensure support for social inclusion. There are examples the world over of citizens’ willingness to pay for a more inclusive society. The most powerful form of support is through the fscal realm, whereby citizens pay taxes that they know will fund policies and programs for greater social inclusion. In Brazil, Mexico, and Nepal, for instance, there is strong support for social protection programs. In Bangladesh, poverty reduction is recognized as a national priority, and the elite support antipoverty initiatives (Hossain and Moore 1999). Tentative evidence from Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda shows that attitudes toward redistribution may be favorable overall (Langer and others 2016). 
Analytic Strategy and Road Map 
This report sets out Africa’s development imperatives within a framework of social inclusion. It outlines some of the areas in which Africa has taken major strides and simultaneously asks: who is left behind, from what, in what ways, and what can be done? The key questions in this report are drawn from the Social Inclusion Assessment Tool
1 and from Das (2016). The report also highlights the 
many solutions that are already in place in various African countries. It is deeply infuenced by the myriad conversations and engagements that World Bank teams have had with partners and counterparts across Africa.The groundswell of thought and action, combined with the strong push from both state and nonstate actors for the World Bank Group (WBG) to articulate social inclusion in the African context, has led to several structured engagements between the WBG and a multitude of its partners. These encounters are laid out in appendix A. Consequently, the audience for this report includes an equally wide array of actors: governments, private sector, civil society, academics, the media, and others. This report also is expected to infuence the way that the WBG will conduct its business in Africa going forward.

 Over the years, several macro- and micro-level analyses have been published on 
issues relevant to social inclusion in Africa. The WBG produces regular Systematic Country Diagnostics (SCDs) for each of its partner countries. These diagnostics from African countries have shown issues of social inclusion to be central to reducing poverty. The diagnostics also have focused on individuals and groups who are at risk of being left out of the progress and prosperity that now sweep most of Africa. This report builds on these macro-level diagnostics and on other regional and country reports focusing on poverty and human development. It also synthesizes other existing evidence to stimulate debate, research, and policies for social inclusion in Africa. Our hope is that this report will enable new questions to be framed and addressed, although, like all regional reports, it can do only limited justice to the vast heterogeneity of the continent. The analytic foundation for  this report therefore, comes from a comprehensive review of the literature on social inclusion and data from, among others, poverty assessments, Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), World Development Indicators (WDI), United Nations, Afrobarometer surveys, and World Values Surveys (WVS). 
The report contains fve chapters. This frst chapter lays out the motivation for 
this work and clarifes concepts and underlying assumptions. Chapter 2 highlights the major trends and transitions that shape the context for social inclusion in Africa and describes who may be left behind. Chapter 3 provides pointers on the processes that underlie exclusion and those that foster social inclusion. Attitudes, perceptions, and feelings are elaborated. Chapter 4 highlights Africa’s movement toward social inclusion. Who are the key actors? Which innovations promote social inclusion in Africa? What evidence do we have about what has made a positive difference? Chapter 5 concludes the discussion and provides guidance on framing the right questions for inclusive solutions.

 Africa Is Striding: 
Who’s Left Behind? 
As we embark on this great collective journey, we pledge that no one 
will be left behind. Recognizing that the dignity of the human person is fundamental, we wish to see the Goals and targets met for all nations and peoples and for all segments of society. And we will endeavour to reach the furthest behind frst. 
—Resolution adopted by United Nations General Assembly on 
September 25, 2015 
Over the past few decades,Africa has seen extraordinary progress. 
In fact, in some areas, the progress in Africa is faster than it is in any other region, and sometimes faster than we have historically seen anywhere in the world. However, the trends are highly heterogeneous across and within countries. Although they hold the promise of greater heights, they also create new challenges for social inclusion. 
Digital technology, for instance, can leave further behind 
those who do not have mobile phones or Internet connections. Similarly, improved infrastructure has provided better lives, but also carries risks, for instance, of lands being unfairly taken from those most powerless or of damage to the environment or livelihoods. Improvements in education and health can be concentrated in certain locations and for some groups. Areas that experience state and societal fragility also fall behind in various development outcomes. 
So, both areas and peoples can be excluded from the gains that the 
continent has achieved. Chapter 2 discusses the major trends and transitions in Africa with a focus on their potential implications for social inclusion. The chapter begins with a discussion of how poverty reduction, demographic changes, climate change, and confict in a context of rapid urbanization are likely to affect social inclusion.

 Demographic Trends and Human Capital Accumulation 
Population and Fertility 
Global population is certainly growing, but fertility is falling in every world  
region (fgure 2.1). More than half of the anticipated growth in global population  
between now  and 2050 is expected to occur in Africa (UN DESA Population  
Division 2019).  Yet, Sub-Saharan Africa will see the largest reductions in average  
total fertility, which is projected to fall from approximately 4.6 live births per  
woman in 2019 to 3.1 in 2050 and 2.1 by 2100. Globally, there are 36 countries or  
areas in which the fertility rates are above 4 births per woman; of these,  33 are in  
Sub-Saharan Africa.  The most populous countries with total fertility rates of more  
than 4 are, in order of size: Nigeria, Ethiopia, Democratic Republic of Congo,  
Tanzania, Uganda, and Sudan. By 2050, Niger is expected to be the only country  
with a total fertility rate (TFR) of 4.0.  There are large variations both within and  
across countries, and countries of Southern Africa have much lower fertility rates  
than do other areas. Countries with the highest fertility and the slowest decline  
are those most affected by confict and fragility.  Africa also has the world’s highest  
rates of teen pregnancy; approximately 46 percent of all births to girls and women  
in the 15 to 19 age group occur in Africa (UN DESA Population Division 2019).

  Why does fertility matter for social inclusion? It matters because women are the 
bearers of children and, for the most part, rear them. When to have children, how many to have, and how much space there is between children are all factors that cast inexorable infuence on the life chances of women and their children and, to an extent, of men and entire families. Women’s ability to control their fertility and their reproductive rights are inseparable from their overall welfare outcomes and those of their children and families. When women do not have access to or information about birth control, their overall agency is diminished. This point is especially salient for adolescent girls, who often have the least power, information, and ability to control their fertility. Although there have been rapid changes in access to contraception in some parts of Africa, the unmet need for family planning is still signifcant. Between 2000 and 2017, Middle and West Africa saw increases in contraceptive prevalence (from 18 to 23 percent and from 13 to 20 percent, respectively). However, in 2017 unmet needs for family planning remained constant at levels above 20 percent. East Africa, Middle Africa, West Africa, Melanesia, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Polynesia had the highest unmet needs for family planning in 2017. This need indicates a supply side failure, leaving women who may want to control their fertility unable to fnd the means to do so (UN DESA Population Division 2017b). However, there also may be other factors that affect women’s desire for more children. 
Health and Mortality 
As in fertility, Africa has seen improvements in health and longevity, but under-
fve mortality is still high. Children’s survival to age fve is a core indicator of welfare, but also has additional ramifcations. For example, high rates of under-fve mortality are associated with higher fertility. Moreover, because countries with high levels of child mortality are bogged down by the most basic imperative of keeping children alive, these countries are less able to invest in human capital. Based on United Nations child mortality estimates, according to the Our World in Data project and AfricaInData.org, from 1980 to 2015, child mortality declined sharply.
1 In fact, compared to other regions, between 1990 and 2016, Africa saw 
the fastest decline. Despite these improvements, Africa still has the highest under-fve mortality rate, at 78 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2016. In other words, approximately 1 child in 13 still dies before her/his ffth birthday (Suzuki and Kashiwase 2017). There is considerable variation across African countries, and fragile states have the highest rates of under-fve mortality. 
Life expectancy has also increased in the last few decades, but AIDS has had 
long-term deleterious impacts. Overall, between 2000 and 2015, compared with South Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean, Africa saw the largest increase in life expectancy, (UNDP 2016, 96). Yet, in 2019 the countries with the lowest life expectancies also are in Africa. They are Central African Republic, Chad, Lesotho,

 Nigeria, and Sierra Leone, each with life expectancy at birth below 55 years (UN DESA Population Division 2019). African countries also were ravaged by AIDS-related mortality, which globally declined sharply, driven by the huge improvements in Africa. In most high-prevalence countries, AIDS-related mortality peaked in the last decade. Nevertheless, many countries have not yet recovered fully from the effects of the epidemic. In Southern Africa, life expectancy at birth fell from 62.9 years in 1990 to 52.6 years in 2004 and has since recovered to just above the 1990 level, having reached 63.8 years in 2019. This lower life expectancy at birth represents a loss of two decades of potential improvements in survival rates for Southern Africa. HIV/AIDS continues to have other long-term consequences, and stigma against persons with HIV is still evident. The catastrophic long-term effects for orphans, estimated at 52 million in Africa,
2 deserve special attention. 
As African countries proceed with the demographic transition, the age structure of their populations is poised for transformation. Today, half of the population in the region is under 25 years of age. By 2050 the continent will have 362 million young people who are between 15 and 24 years of age (World Bank 2014). Simultaneously, many African countries will see aging of the population. By 2050 Africa’s over-60 population is expected to more than triple, from 69 million in 2017 to 226 million (UN DESA Population Division 2017a). Although youth inclusion is the immediate challenge facing the region, the inclusion of older cohorts of Africans will soon be a part of the picture. This huge increase of persons over 60 is something that policy-makers fnd diffcult to visualize. Nevertheless, today Africa’s growing young population has the potential to dramatically drive development and further reduce poverty, if the right policies and opportunities are provided for them (box 2.1). 
Education and Accumulation of Human Capital 
In education, too, there has been signifcant progress, but as in other parts of 
the world, there are stark inequalities in educational outcomes based on identity markers. The average primary gross enrollment ratio in the region increased from 68 percent in 1990 to 98 percent in 2015, and the number of enrolled students grew from 63 million to 152 million. Yet, despite the increase in primary school enrollment rates, an estimated 52.3 million primary- and lower secondary school– age children (ages 6–14 and 7–15) are still out of school, accounting for 45 percent of the world’s out-of-school child population (Bashir and others 2018). There also is a signifcant gap in literacy between males and females, with West Africa having the highest gender gaps and Southern Africa having the lowest (fgure 2.2). Overall, quality of education is a point of growing concern. 
The overlay of gender with other identity markers confers additional disadvantage 
in education, as it does in other outcomes. Using census data,Taş and others (2014) show that ethnic minority women in Senegal and Sierra Leone suffer cumulative

   Box 2.1 Ability, Opportunity, and Dignity for African Youth 
African countries are abuzz with initiatives that either focus on young people or are run by them, or both. 
The youngest among all continents, half of Africa’s population is below 25 years 
of age. These young people are innovators, leaders, entrepreneurs, social media influencers, writers, volunteers, activists, and professionals. Asserting their African identity, they exercise thoughtful leadership at local, national, and global levels in a variety of ways. Nevertheless, evidence from an array of sources, some of which is highlighted in this report, shows their unique needs. This report also portrays the heterogeneity of African youth—the intersectional advantage or disadvantage bequeathed by gender, occupation, religion, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, location, sexual orientation, and marital status. The report also shines a light on certain aspects, including vulnerability to gender-based violence, female genital mutilation (FGM), child marriage, and reintegration of young ex-combatants. Building human capital and hearing these voices are central to the inclusion of youth in Africa, as in the world over. 
The World Bank’s social inclusion framework highlights the importance of ability, 
opportunity, and dignity in advancing inclusion (World Bank 2013). These three 
elements are nowhere more salient than for young people who crave and aspire 
to the right to make decisions about their own lives and for their communities and countries. While the focus on jobs in Africa is important in the face of high levels of youth unemployment, there is  a need for policy that would give young people the status and dignity that they deserve. This report presentsevidence of the changing nature of young persons’ participation in political processes. 
While the downward trend of youth turnout in elections is indeed worrying, we should not confuse apathy about the political process with a lack of passion about the issues and challenges facing the world. It is clear that the sense of disillusionment that many young people feel for our political institutions refects the fact that they have been sidelined by them. If young people do not think that they can make a difference through these institutions and processes, should we really be surprised at their ambivalence towards them?
 —Kofi Annan, 2013
a 
If young people feel left out of markets, services, and tangible and intangible spaces, their potential dejection and frustration can have long-term consequences for them, their families, and their societies. At the individual level, dejection can lower human capital and increase mental health costs. If it becomes pervasive among a large group of the youth, it can take the form of radicalization and violence. This report describes some of the challenges for youth in Africa, and how young people often are potent change agents in their communities.

disadvantages in literacy,  primary school completion, and secondary school  
completion. In Senegal, for example, individuals are 10 percentage points less likely  
to complete primary school for being female, 1.6 percentage points for being ethnic  
minority, and an additional 3.8 percentage points for being ethnic minority women.  
Therefore,  cumulatively,  women  of ethnic minority groups are approximately 15.4  
percentage points less likely to complete primary school than men belonging to  
majority ethnic groups in Senegal. In South Africa, despite signifcant progress  
since the end of apartheid,  educational outcomes among black and colored South  
Africans remain low.  Although the white population reached close to full attainment  
of 12 years of education in 1920, the black population has yet to achieve these  
levels, perpetuating the legacy of racial division in education in South Africa, which  
remains a main driver of poverty and inequality (World Bank 2018f, 13). Similarly,  
the Benin Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) notes that the lack of maternal  
language teaching in primary school puts indigenous children at a disadvantage and  
leads them to abandon school prematurely (World Bank 2017b, 57). 
Disability status is another critical determinant of educational outcomes. Data  
from the Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) in Ethiopia, Malawi,  
Tanzania, and Uganda suggest that 10 percent to 15 percent of working-age  
adults in Africa have a disability.  “Disability” is defned as moderate or severe  
functional diffculty with walking, seeing, hearing, cognition, self-care, or

 communication (Mitra 2018).3 Multiple studies have presented evidence of lower 
educational attainment of persons with disabilities in Africa (Eide and Mmatli 2016; Filmer 2008; Hoogeveen 2005; Loeb and Eide 2004; Loeb and others 2008; Mitra 2018; Mitra and others 2013; Mizunoya and others 2016). In the cases of Ethiopia, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda, Mitra (2018) fnds that both adults with moderate functional diffculties and those with severe functional diffculties are signifcantly less likely to ever have attended school than adults with no functional diffculties. In Ethiopia, only 15 percent of persons with severe functional diffculties (and 24 percent with moderate functional diffculties) have ever attended school, compared to 48 percent of persons with no functional diffculties. In Uganda, 60 percent of persons with severe functional diffculties and 73 percent with moderate functional diffculties have ever attended school, compared to 89 percent with no functional diffculties.

When disability status is combined with gender, we see the real effects of intersectional disadvantage. The extent of this disadvantage varies across countries. In Malawi, only 35 percent of women with severe functional diffculties have ever been to school, compared to 65 percent of men with severe functional diffculties. In Tanzania, these numbers are 30 percent of women versus 61 percent of men with severe functional diffculties; and in Uganda, 48 percent of women compared to 74 percent of men with severe functional diffculties. In Ethiopia, rates are much lower than in the other three countries for both men and women: 14 percent of women with severe functional diffculties have ever attended school, compared with 16 percent of men with severe functional diffculties. Gender gaps appear to widen with greater functional diffculty. Therefore, a woman with a disability has fewer years of schooling than any other category: men without a functional diffculty, women without functional diffculty, and men with functional diffculty. Outcomes differ further by type of disability, but the lack of reliable data seriously constrains analysis and action. For instance, data for intellectual disabilities are particularly scarce, as are assessment facilities and avenues for accessibility. There has been growing attention to albinism, a genetic disorder that causes severe functional diffculties, but data and evidence are limited. Box 2.2 provides a short overview on how albinism affects human capital outcomes. 
Economic Transitions 
Growth and Poverty Reduction 
Since the 1990s, poverty has decreased impressively. However, during the same 
period, the absolute numbers of the poor have increased dramatically. The poverty head count declined steadily from 57 percent of the African population in 1990 to 41 percent in 2015.
5 Concurrently, due to growth in the numbers of people overall, 
the absolute number of people living in poverty increased from approximately 278

 Box 2.2 Albinism and Human Capital Outcomes 
Albinism is a genetic disorder that results in a decrease or absence of pigmentation in the hair, eyes, and skin. Prevalence data are not available for most countries in Africa. Nevertheless, compared to global estimates of approximately 1:20,000, estimates for Africa range from 1:15,000 (1 person with albinism in every 15,000 people) to as high as 1:1,000 in some areas of Tanzania and Zimbabwe. Certain ethnic groups seem to display higher prevalence rates, likely linked to factors that include limited geographic mobility, consanguinity, and certain traditional marriage practices that limit the genetic pool. 
The lack of melanin, which has a protective function against ultraviolet radiation 
(UVR), predisposes individuals with albinism to a range of pathologic conditions, including photophobia, decreased visual acuity, extreme sun sensitivity, and skin cancer. One 2002 study suggested that all persons with albinism had some form of visual impairment, and that the latter had strong implications for their education and overall life chances. Another study in Tanzania found that all individuals with albinism exhibited skin damage in their first year of life and that those ages 20 to 30 had advanced symptomatic cancers. Many of the negative, and even lethal, outcomes for persons with albinism are associated with stigma, ignorance, and superstition. Nevertheless, life expectancy of persons with albinism has increased significantly over the past decades: whereas in the 1980s, it was estimated that fewer than 10 percent of persons with albinism would survive beyond 30 years and fewer than 2 percent would reach 40 years. They now live considerably longer because of advances in preventive sun protection.

    million to over 413 million. There also is signifcant divergence in performance 
across African countries driven by several factors, among which fragility, confict, and endowment of natural resources stand out (fgure 2.3). Between 1996 and 2012, poverty decline in fragile states in Africa was less than the decline in the nonfragile states in Africa. After controlling for a set of country characteristics, poverty reduction in fragile states was 15 percentage points less than it was in nonfragile states (Beegle and others 2016). After controlling for other country traits, countries rich in natural resources reduced poverty by 13 percentage points faster than did non-resource-rich countries. A caveat is in order here: Unless their institutions are robust enough, countries that are endowed with natural resources can fall prey to the “resource curse,” which can exacerbate fragility and confict. 
Asking “Who are the poor?” and breaking down the poverty numbers, we fnd 
greater complexity. For the relationship between gender and poverty, for example, there is a long tradition of analysis. Overall, women are not necessarily poorer than men, nor are male-headed households necessarily better off. Moreover, in many countries in Africa, female-headed households have experienced faster poverty reduction than Asking “Who are the poor?” and breaking down the poverty numbers, we fnd greater complexity.

 van de Walle 2017). More nuanced fndings emerge when gender is looked at 
jointly with age and marital status. Young married women, but more so those who are young and widowed, are especially vulnerable (Milazzo and van de Walle 2017). However, older men are on average 8 percentage points poorer than their female counterparts (Munoz Boudet and others 2018). 
Mitra and others’ 2011 study in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mauritius, 
Zambia, and Zimbabwe is possibly the most detailed analysis of disability and poverty. They show that the relationship between disability and poverty varies by the measures of both poverty and disability that are used in the analysis. The most conclusive result is that, when expanded measures of disability are used along with measures of multidimensional poverty, there are “signifcant disparities in disability prevalence in most countries by poverty status” (39). Figure 2.4 and box 2.3 analyze the extent to which ethnicity matters for poverty in select African countries. 
Box 2.3 Ethnicity and Poverty in Rural and Urban Africa 
As in other regions globally, ethnicity can be a fraught idea in many African 
countries. Some, such as South Africa, expressly and officially acknowledge the importance of race in opportunities and outcomes. Other countries focus purely on citizenship and eschew any focus on ethnicity. The latter often is born of historic conflict that assumed ethnic overtones. However, the literature from regions as diverse as Europe, Latin America, and South Asia shows that 
Source: World Bank calculations based on the latest Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) 
available for countries (Congo, Dem. Rep. DHS-VI 2013/14; Kenya DHS-VII 2014; Malawi DHS-VII 2015/16; Mozambique DHS-VI 2011; Nigeria DHS-VI 2013; Sierra Leone DHS-VI 2013; South Africa DHS-VII 2016; Uganda DHS-VII 2016; Zambia DHS-VI 2013/14). 
64 CHAPTER 2 AFRICA IS STRIDING: WHO’S LEFT BEHIND?  certain ethnic groups are overrepresented among the poor. Their locational 
characteristics often explain their poverty, but this explanation frequently overlooks the political economy of regional development. 
Does ethnicity matter for poverty in Africa? Using the Demographic and Health 
Survey (DHS), which has data on ethnicity and wealth based on a household’s ownership of select assets, we analyzed data from nine countries. They were Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Uganda, and Zambia. Looking at the 10 largest ethnic groups in rural and urban areas,  we found that ethnicity does indeed matter for wealth outcomes, but mostly in rural areas and significantly less so in cities and towns. The results from figure 2.4 are summarized below: 
• Overall, certain ethnic groups are overrepresented in the poorest wealth 
quintile in all nine countries. Disparities between ethnic groups are larger in rural areas than in urban areas. 
• Size of the ethnic groups does not seem to matter. This result is unsurprising because across the world, the size of an ethnic group seldom has a linear association with its welfare outcomes. 
• The greatest dispersion along ethnic lines in the poorest quintile in rural areas appears to occur in Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda, followed by lesser dispersion in Zambia and Mozambique. Although the overrepresentation of some ethnic groups in the lowest wealth quintile is more pronounced in some countries than in others, overrepresentation may or may not reflect absolute gaps in wealth between these groups.

 Food Security 
Contrary to the Malthusian specter of population growth jeopardizing food 
production, between 1990 and 2015, Sub-Saharan Africa experienced the steepest decline of food defcit in the world. During this period, the food defcit in African countries halved,
6 whereas other regions, including South Asia and the Middle East, 
experienced fuctuations (fgure 2.5). Nevertheless, over 50 million children under age fve in Africa remain stunted: the Region has the second highest stunting and wasting rates in the world, after South Asia. Africa also is the only Region in which the absolute number of stunted children has increased over time, mainly due to population growth. These children will have diffculty reaching their full potential as adults. Globally, children living in households in the poorest quintile have higher stunting rates than children in other income groups. One study in Tanzania showed that the Maasai were disadvantaged compared to their neighboring ethnic groups on measures of both child nutritional status and disease. Although food insecurity was high throughout the study area, the Maasai fared worse (Lawson and others 2014). Other children, such as orphans, children of parents affected by HIV, or those whose parents engage in precarious occupations (such as waste picking), also are likely to have a higher risk of malnutrition.

Income from labor tends to play an important role in poverty reduction.  The 
Afrobarometer (2016) asked respondents to list their top ten priorities or problems.  
Unemployment emerges as the top concern among urban men and women.  
Interestingly, the urban-rural difference in priorities trumps the gender difference: 
males and females give similar responses about their priorities. In Africa overall,  
the jobs challenge that gains spotlight in the media, in social media, and in political manifestos also is refected in fgure 2.6.  This challenge is compounded by the

 fact that labor markets can be notoriously exclusionary. African countries are no 
exception: employment outcomes vary across groups. This variation is not only caused by exclusion or discrimination. However, it often is diffcult to separate the effects of exclusion from those of other factors, such as human capital and effort. 
Regardless of the reasons for differential outcomes in the labor market, some 
groups are systematically under greater stress due to either poor quality jobs or unemployment.Women’s labor force participation generally is higher in Africa than in other non-OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries, and differentials in labor outcomes are lower. However, Africa does have signifcant barriers to women’s economic empowerment. For example, historically, African women have been very active in agriculture yet have fewer opportunities in other sectors. Labor market outcomes also vary across other groups, such as youth. Most young people in Africa do not have easy transitions into the sustainable jobs that are an intrinsic marker of adulthood (Filmer and Fox 2014). In Zambia, Bhorat and others (2015) found that the youth are disproportionately affected by both unemployment and marginal or underemployment, with stronger effects for young women than for young men. Factors other than gender and age also matter for labor market outcomes. The South African evidence suggests that, despite progress since apartheid, signifcant earnings differentials persist between African, colored, and white people. Whites earn 40 percent more per additional year of education than Africans and 20 percent more per additional year than colored people (Salisbury 2016). 
In addition to the fairly well-known differentials in employment outcomes 
across gender, age, and race or ethnicity, data availability has revealed the poorer outcomes for persons with disabilities. This focus comes through in several recent studies (for example, Eide and Loeb 2006 for Zambia; Eide and Mmatli 2016 for Botswana; Mitra 2008 for South Africa; and Mitra and others 2013 for 15 developing countries, including Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mauritius, Zambia, and Zimbabwe). Hoogeveen (2005, 7) and Mitra (2018, 104) show further that persons with disabilities are more likely to be self-employed in agriculture and less likely to be employees. There also are variations in outcomes across different types and intensities of disability. Using data from Ethiopia, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda, Mitra (2018) points to large gaps in employment between persons with severe disabilities and those with no disabilities. The largest gaps were noted in Tanzania, where 53 percent of persons with severe functional diffculties were employed, compared to 85 percent of persons with no functional diffculty. Regarding poverty, Mitra (2018) points out that, although people with functional diffculties are overrepresented among the poor, not all of them are poor (156).

 Technology and Digital Inclusion 
Although this era is the global age of technology, the value of this potent medium 
to the people is determined by the extent to which countries, regions, communities, and households have access to it. Although, in many respects, Africa seems to have leapfrogged into the digital economy, great variation exists across and within countries. For example, in nonfragile countries, mobile cellular subscriptions increased from 0.67 per 100 persons in 2000 to 83 per 100 persons in 2016. In fragile countries, on the other hand, subscriptions increased from 0.20 per 100 persons in 2000 to 68 per 100 persons in 2016. Despite a relatively faster rate of increase in mobile cellular subscriptions in fragile countries, the number of mobile cellular subscriptions is still higher in nonfragile countries (Calderon and others 2019, 49). Similarly, fnancial technology (“fntech”) has expanded rapidly across Africa over the past years: 21 percent of adults in Africa now have a mobile money account, with numbers having doubled since 2014, the highest of any region globally (Demirgüç-Kunt and others 2018). M-PESA, a money transfer system in Kenya, is one of the earliest and perhaps one of the most prominent examples of fntech in Africa. Digital technology also can spearhead employment, as the recent World Bank report on the future of work in Africa points out (Choi and others 2019). 
ICT [information and communications technology] literacy will give women, especially in rural areas, a chance to join the virtual labor market. For example, many of today’s women in Sudan are using social media to exhibit their products. These women saw social media as a platform to sell their products because of the challenges they would face due to cultural and social constraints. 
—Moneera Yassien, 2019 
Digital technology is a potent vehicle for social inclusion, but it also can be a channel to deepen exclusion. The proportion of individuals who have access to the Internet in each African country is highly correlated with that country’s income level. Regionally, Internet use is lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa, where a median of 41 percent of persons across six countries use the Internet. South Africa is the only country in the Region in which almost 60 percent of the population is online (Pew Research Center 2018b). Furthermore, the Pew Research Center Spring 2017 Global Attitudes Survey in six countries showed that males with higher education and higher income levels were more likely to use smartphones (fgure 2.7). Nonusers of smartphones are left out of many opportunities to access markets, services, and spaces.

For income, differences are between those with an income below the approximate country median, and those at or above the approximate country median. 
Africa’s social geography is rapidly changing; it is, for example, the fastest 
urbanizing region in the world (fgure 2.8). Currently, approximately 472 million people live in cities and towns—a number that is expected to double over the next 25 years (Lall and others 2017).  There are, however, large subregional variations.  
Most people in North and Southern Africa already live in cities.  West Africa is 
projected to reach an urban majority just after 2020, whereas urbanization rates are still below 20 percent in East Africa (UN-Habitat 2014). Nigeria is among the top three urbanizing countries in the world.  Together with China and India,  
Nigeria is estimated to account for 35 percent of the projected growth of the world’s urban population between 2018 and 2050, adding 189 million urban dwellers (UN DESA Population Division 2018).  
Cities and towns simultaneously are bastions of inclusion and sites of exclusion.  
Migration from villages to cities and towns tends to be accompanied by aspirations

 for a new life, greater social and economic mobility, and better access to markets, services, and spaces. It often also means separation from family and social networks and a sense of loneliness for those who do not have networks in their new abodes. A 2016 study from South Africa shows that rural-urban migration between 2008 and 2012 was accompanied by an 8.3 percent decrease in the subjective well-being of migrants (Mulcahy and Kollamparambil 2016). Furthermore, as cities often lack careful planning, approximately 60 percent of Africa’s urban population lives in informal settlements, compared to 34 percent in other developing countries (UN DESA Statistics Division 2015, cited in Lall and others 2017, 38). Finally, in most cities, informal workers, such as waste pickers, domestic workers, street vendors, and others, experience serious barriers to doing business. Yet, cities also often provide a more anonymous space than do rural areas. Cities can enable individuals from excluded groups to escape discrimination and to pursue job and education opportunities that they would not have had in a rural context. Although additional research is needed to understand the mechanisms through which these outcomes succeed, fgure 2.5 shows that, in urban areas, wealth disparities between ethnic groups are less pronounced than in rural areas. At the same time, in urban areas, ethnic groups and migrants tend to cluster residentially and occupationally, with varying effects for social inclusion. 
Despite the considerable attention to Africa’s urban growth and advances in service 
delivery, there also is evidence that location matters and that many areas lag. Figure 2.9 shows the advances in electricity coverage and basic drinking water services in the last decade. Almost every country has seen advances in both (more so for electricity than for water), but some countries have done better than others. South Africa, Cabo Verde, and Gabon are at the higher end of service provision, and Mauritius and Seychelles are at the highest end. In electricity provision, Burundi, Chad, South Sudan, Malawi, and the Central African Republic have the poorest outcomes. For water services, the bottom four countries are Eritrea, Uganda, Ethiopia, and Somalia, where less than 40 percent of the populations have basic drinking water. In general, countries that are in confict or experience fragility have poorer outcomes than do others. Clearly, there are lagging regions within countries; and individuals and groups who live in these regions may have other defning characteristics, such as belonging to a particular ethnic or other group. 
Lagging regions across the world also are those whose people have less voice and 
political power than people in other regions. African countries are no exception. The popular discourse in many African countries makes explicit links between political power and uneven regional development, pointing out that areas that have better political connections to those in power tend to fare better. Box 2.4 highlights the case of north and northeastern Kenya, which historically have fared worse than the rest of the country. These lagging areas are inhabited by current or previous pastoralists and historically have been prone to being left out of services.

  In Uganda, where electricity coverage is low in general, almost half of the Muganda 
respondents in the 2011 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) reported having electricity, but less than 5 percent of the Lugbara and Ngakaramajong did. Afrobarometer found similar results by self-reported water insecurity. The Langi, the Ateso, and the Alur reported the highest incidence of having experienced water insecurity “many times or always”; whereas the Mutooro, Mukiga, and Munyankole were most likely to report never having experienced such insecurity (World Bank 2013, 96). 
Finally, the majority of Africa’s population still lives in rural areas, and there is 
a signifcant rural-urban opportunity divide. Take the case of health services: about 56 percent of the rural population around the world lacks health coverage, compared to 22 percent of the urban population, with the most deprived rural population living in Africa (Scheil-Adlung 2015, 6). Within rural areas, exclusion from health services also may be more severe for women, the elderly, some ethnic groups, and migrants (Scheil-Adlung 2015, 30). In South Africa, despite provision of free antenatal care for two decades, nonwhite women and those living in rural areas are less likely to receive antenatal care or to have a skilled attendant present at delivery than white women in urban areas (Burgard 2004; Say and Raine 2007; Silal and others 2012; all cited in World Bank 2013, 95). 
Box 2.4 Areas and Peoples: North and Northeast Kenya 
Areas in the north and northeast of Kenya remain largely left out of recent 
economic progress. The 10 counties of Garissa, Isiolo, Lamu, Mandera, Marsabit, Samburu, Tana River, Turkana, Wajir, and West Pokot remain below the national average of living standards indicators, and regional disparities are stark. The Kenya Integrated Household and Budget Survey 2015–2016 indicates that the average poverty rate in the 10 counties is 68 percent, compared to the national average of 36 percent. Primary school attendance in the north and northeast averages 55 percent, compared to the national average of 82 percent. Secondary school attendance is 19 percent, versus 37 percent nationally. The average literacy rate among women is 41 percent, compared to 89 percent for the country as a whole. Thirty-four percent of births are assisted by a skilled provider, compared to a national average of 71 percent. 
Today’s disparities can be traced back to colonial rule and the early years of 
independence. Initial development during British colonial rule was focused on the Kenya-Uganda railway corridor. The north and northeast—then dubbed the Northern Frontier District—were considered a buffer zone against hostile neighboring countries. The lack of infrastructure and services in this area and strict regulation of travel permits served that interest. Secessionist tendencies 
74 CHAPTER 2 AFRICA IS STRIDING: WHO’S LEFT BEHIND?  of the Somali minorities in the Northern Frontier District and distrust of the 
newly formed independent Kenyan state led to the “Shifta War” from 1963 to 1967, after which emergency rule was established in the area and not lifted until 1991. In addition, Sessional Paper No. 10 of 1965 directed public spending to areas with potential for high economic returns to achieve rapid growth. Investments focused on agricultural areas and neglected the social and economic infrastructure in the arid north and northeast. 
For decades, the north and northeastern regions have been underserved by 
infrastructure and government services. Road networks are extremely poor, often cutting off these regions from the rest of the country during the rainy season. In the dry season, it can take on average three days to reach Mandera via Isiolo from Nairobi, a distance of about 983 kilometers. The counties of Isiolo, Wajir, Mandera, and Garissa cover 26 percent of Kenya’s land mass but are home to only 6 percent of the total road network in the country. Only 57 percent of households in this region have access to safe water and 34 percent to improved sanitation, compared to the national averages of 72 and 59 percent, respectively. 
Pastoralism is the main economic activity in the north and northeastern 
regions; 90 percent of the population relies on livestock-based livelihoods. These arid or semiarid areas struggle with frequent droughts. Some conflicts among pastoralist communities, such as cattle raiding and rustling, have a long history but have become increasingly destructive due to the proliferation of small arms, organized crime, competition over control and access to natural resources such as water and pasture, land issues, the diminishing role of traditional governance systems, ethnocentrism, increasing levels of poverty and idleness among the youth, and inadequate security. Additionally, low levels of human capital call for capacity to be imported from other parts of the country for public service delivery. However, due to the lack of infrastructure and services in the area, the challenging security situation, and persistent stereotypes and prejudices, it is difficult to attract and retain qualified staff. In 2012 the vacancy rate for health professionals in north and northeastern Kenya was assessed at 79 percent.

 Climate-Related Events and Trends 
Climate change is forging unprecedented spatial and other transitions and is likely 
to affect many aspects of life globally, and certainly in Africa. Climate-related events, for instance, affect livelihoods, health, education, and general well-being; they could reverse many of the gains that African countries have made. Extreme weather events also contribute to large-scale, involuntary population movements. Africa is expected to host 86 million persons who, due to the effects of climate change, likely will migrate by 2050 (Rigaud and others 2018). Rapid-onset events such as extreme storms or foods (box 2.5) tend to lead to short-term displacement, followed by return to affected areas. However, such events also can generate a combination of short- and longer term displacement and out-migration. In contrast, slow-onset events including droughts or desertifcation, such as of the Sahel, tend to lead to gradual long-term out-migration. Many internal migrants move to major cities; indeed, internal migration is a signifcant contributor to urbanization (Tacoli and others 2015, cited in Rigaud and others 2018, 18). Nairobi is one example of a city likely to see increased climate-driven in-migration. At the same time, low-lying cities, along with coastlines vulnerable to sea level rise and areas of high water and agriculture stress, are at risk of climate-induced out-migration. Addis Ababa and Dar el Salaam are among the cities likely to see dampened population growth due to rising sea level and storm surges (Rigaud and others 2018). 
The impacts of climate-related events on individuals and groups go beyond 
migration and competition for resources to alter social processes. Marriage markets are an example. One study looked at the effects of rainfall variability on age at marriage in Africa and India. The research demonstrated that in Africa drought increased the likelihood of early marriage, whereas in India drought lowered that likelihood. The two contradictory impacts likely are related to the traditional transfers linked to marriage (bride price in Africa and dowry in India). The opposite results refect the cultural and social mores that underpin household responses to rainfall shocks and the economic hardships that they confer (Corno and others 2016, cited in Das 2017). Another study from South Africa showed that single headship of a household makes it more vulnerable during times of variable rainfall. In particular, households headed by widows, never-married women, and women with a nonresident spouse (for example,“left-behind” migrant households) are especially vulnerable. The results are more signifcant in areas that tend to rely on rain-fed agriculture (Flatø and others 2017, cited in Das 2017).

 Box 2.5 Urban Floods: Disproportionate Effects 
At the time of writing, Cyclones Idai and Kenneth had wreaked havoc in many parts of Southern Africa. Such shocks have become commonplace as countries struggle to keep apace. Floods account for almost half of natural hazards in most metropolitan areas. Groups that are disproportionately affected are often (though not always) poor; they include, among others, migrant workers, the elderly, persons with disabilities, and people working in trades that are particularly susceptible to disruption during natural hazards, like street vendors and waste pickers. Persons with disabilities may lack access to warnings, evacuation notices, emergency shelters, or food distribution; they may become homebound during floods, be left behind in evacuations, or be separated from family members and caregivers (Das and Majumdar 2019). The disproportionate nature of effects plays out in other ways too. Ajibade and others (2013) found that the impacts of flash floods in Lagos, Nigeria, were differentiated by gender and income level. Women in lower-income neighborhoods had more intense negative impacts and took longer to recover when compared to other groups. Location also matters: urban (and rural) floods may be particularly damaging for groups living on fragile lands, in informal settlements, in low-lying areas, or in precarious housing situations. These groups may lack resilient infrastructure, and their schools, homes, and health centers may be the last to be rehabilitated (Das and Majumdar 2019). As we design programs for adaptation to climate change and mitigation of its impacts, we need to be cognizant of the fact that emergencies can often exacerbate existing inequalities and asymmetrical power relations and that both prevention and response need to take this into account.

 Confict and Fragility: Challenges to Social Inclusion 
Peace is not just the absence of confict; peace is the creation of 
an environment where all can fourish, regardless of race, colour, creed, religion, gender, class, caste, or any other social markers of difference. Religion, ethnicity, language, social and cultural practices are elements which enrich human civilization, adding to the wealth of our diversity. 
—Nelson Mandela, 2004 
As do other parts of this report, the preceding discussion highlights that areas that face confict or fragility have poorer outcomes across a number of domains. Individuals and groups who reside in these areas struggle for access to markets, services, and spaces. The least powerful among them sometimes face terrible atrocities. Although neither conficts nor humanitarian emergencies are exclusively African problems or only problems of poor and fragile situations, Africa does face some unique challenges. As an example, in 2016, Africa saw 3.9 million new internal displacements due to confict, violence, and sudden-onset disasters. Together with the Middle East and North Africa Region, Sub-Saharan Africa hosts the largest numbers of forcibly displaced groups, with a sharp increase over the past several years. For example, although in 2012 each of the two regions had about 8 million displaced people, in 2017 this number increased to 21.5 million in the Middle East and North Africa and 18.4 million in Sub-Saharan Africa (fgure 2.10). Within Sub-Saharan Africa, most forced displacement took place domestically: of the 18.4 million people displaced in 2017, 12.5 million were internally displaced persons (IDPs) and 5.9 percent were refugees (fgure 2.11). 
Confict, the threat of confict, and the likely pursuant displacement affect both 
displaced groups and their host communities. To start, although displacement comes with tremendous suffering, displaced persons are not necessarily the poorest (Beegle and others 2016) and feeing mitigates the detrimental effects of confict (Etang-Ndip and others 2015). Moreover, host communities are affected by the infow of these forced migrants; and in some places, especially in remote and underdeveloped borderlands, they are poorer than IDPs and refugees. The effects of displacement on host communities take place through different channels. For instance, the Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya, based in Turkana County, has a poverty rate of close to 80 percent, compared to the national average of 36 percent (KNBS 2015). In Tanzania, the infux of refugees from Burundi and Rwanda in the 1990s adversely affected Tanzanian casual laborers due to an increase in competition in labor markets and surging prices of goods. Public sector institutions also were affected, as numerous employees from hospitals, schools, and government departments left their positions for better job opportunities in

In Tanzania, the infux of additional labor has helped sectors including agriculture, construction, and housekeeping (Maystadt and Verwimp 2014; Whitaker 2002; both cited in Ogude 2018, 10). The gross regional product (GRP) of Turkana (Kenya) increased by 3.4 percent as a result of the refugee presence; total employment increased by 2.9 percent; and consumption measures within 5 km of the camp were found to be up to 35 percent higher than in other parts of the county (Sanghi and others 2016). 
The aftermath of confict can lead to large numbers of ex-combatants facing 
challenges when they try to reintegrate in their communities. In 2015, the World Bank estimated that there were 194,000 combatants in armed groups in Africa. Ex-combatants the world over face stigma, discrimination, and other challenges in reintegrating into “normal” social and economic activities. Upon return, they may be subject to suspicion or fears from community members, or to tensions related to lifestyles or values (Baxter and Burrall 2011, 21f). Young ex-combatants (ages 18–30) lag behind average ex-combatants in social and economic reintegration, probably as a result of being mobilized as adolescents and never having established stable social and economic identities. These challenges and some solutions are discussed later in this report. 
Political and Civic Participation and Social Movements 
Social inclusion can be advanced when individuals or groups who feel excluded assert their agency through social and political participation. In recent years, the form of participation in many African countries has changed. Recent surveys draw attention to declining participation in formal political and civic processes, particularly among youth and women in Africa. However, the picture is complex. African youth are less likely than their elders to vote,
7 and Afrobarometer data 
suggest that the political participation of young people has declined over the past decade and a half (fgure 2.12). African youth also are less likely than their elders to participate in civic activities.
8 On the other hand, they are more likely than 
their elders to participate in demonstrations and protest marches. Eleven percent of young respondents say they attended at least one protest in the previous year, compared to 8 percent of older respondents. Young women participate even less in public affairs. Compared to their male counterparts, young women report signifcantly less interest in public affairs and discussions around them. 
The decreasing participation in formal political processes may signal several things 
(box 2.12). It may mean disenchantment or lack of faith in the processes. It also may mean that young people use different channels to express their preferences. The importance of social media bears special mention here. The Internet affords anonymity, which allows groups who would otherwise not have a voice to express 
80 CHAPTER 2 AFRICA IS STRIDING: WHO’S LEFT BEHIND?  themselves through digital media.  The youth in Africa are far more active on  
social media and digital platforms than are their older counterparts. Even so, the  
likely disenchantment with political processes may be an indication of broader  
disenchantment with the state (chapter 4). 
While participation in formal political processes seems to be declining, social 
movements continue to raise the profle of social inclusion across Africa.  That 
Africa has a vibrant history of social and political movements is well known.  These 
have included the legendary movements for independence and decolonization,  
critical movements in academia against Eurocentrism, movements for peace and civil liberties, and movements against various economic policies. For example,  
the Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace has been recognized for its role in pressing for Liberian warlords to sign a peace agreement in 2003 that ended 10 years of civil war.  The student-led Fees Must Fall movement in South Africa

 points to the fact that, although young people may not participate in formal political processes, the youth nevertheless are politically very vibrant. Similarly, the movements that assert the rights of indigenous peoples to their culture, lands, and unique identities also have a strong history. Two other contemporary social movements deserve mention: the frst brought attention to HIV/AIDS, and the second to the rights of persons with disabilities. Both have used the axiom “Nothing about us without us” to infuence budget allocations, research priorities, and accessibility and delivery of services to excluded groups. In the process, the movements raised awareness and reduced the widespread stigma against the people they represented. The advocacy movement for albinism is unfolding before our eyes. Each of these campaigns demonstrates that norms and practices are mutable and continue to infuence both the supply side and the demand side of access to markets, services, and spaces. 
Civil society also has galvanized citizens against corruption in several countries 
in Africa. In South Africa, for instance, civil society organizations (CSOs) started campaigning against corruption in the late 1990s, which led to the frst anti-corruption summit by the government in 1999 and the 2001 launch of the National Anti-Corruption Forum, which brought together civil society, businesses, and government in the fght against corruption (Essoungou 2013). In Kenya, CSOs mobilized protests (Occupy Parliament) against the salaries of Members of Parliament (MPs) and in 2013 brought about salary cuts of MPs and the president. Other countries have had similar forms of protest. Across Africa radical feminist movements have gathered strength over the years and have organized to hold states and societies accountable for the poorer opportunities for girls and women. The number of countries in Africa that have freedom of information (FOI) laws has grown substantially in the 21st century, from 4 countries in 2004 to 21 in 2017 (AFIC 2017). Civil society groups and citizens since have used the new laws to improve accountability and governance in areas from public and reproductive health information to access to power, sanitation, and water (Odinkalu and Kadiri 2014).

 Concluding Refections 
The changing development context of the continent, as demonstrated by select 
regional trends, portends new opportunities and challenges for African countries over the next few decades. First, the decline of poverty almost across the board, the enhancement of education, and the improvements in health have meant (and will mean increasingly) that policymakers will need to focus on those who have not benefted from this aggregate progress. Of these, individuals and groups who are affected by confict and fragility stand out, but some groups in nonfragile contexts also are at risk. These include some categories of women, sexual and gender minorities, persons with disabilities, older persons, some categories of youth and children, certain ethnic and racial groups, and those who live in “lagging” regions. Some of these groups are more assertive; others may have festering grievances. 
Second, development spearheads aspiration. As individuals and groups do better, 
they will seek more; this has implications for how governments respond to these heightened aspirations. As is discussed in chapter 3, citizens in many African countries are simultaneously disenchanted with the state and flled with optimism and hope for better lives. As more countries graduate to middle-income status, they will focus on “second-generation” issues of prosperity. The trends and transitions that shape and tame Africa’s dynamism likely will have signifcant implications for social inclusion in the years ahead. Although the focus on poverty must be front and center in addressing social inclusion, states and societies also need to consider the drivers of poverty and why  some groups are left out.

Mitra uses other waves of the LSMS (that do not have the WG questions) to investigate the association between functional diffculties and short-term mortality, including the Malawi Integrated Household Survey (2012/2013), Tanzania National Panel Survey (2012/2013), and Uganda National Panel Survey (2011/2012).

  How Does Social Exclusion 
Play Out in Africa? 
Culture plays a central role in the political, economic and social 
life of communities. Indeed, culture may be the missing link in the development of Africa. Culture is dynamic and evolves over time, consciously discarding retrogressive traditions, like female genital mutilation (FGM), and embracing aspects that are good and useful.
1 
—Wangari Maathai, 2004 
Social exclusion is fundamentally about relations of power. 
Societies the world over devise intricate ways to solidify social structures and systems and uphold the status quo. Structures and systems comprise, among others, families, communities, legal systems; markets, such as labor and land; and knowledge systems. Norms, beliefs, attitudes and practices are the processes through which societies uphold their structures and relegate some groups to subordinate status. Processes also encompass superstitions, stigmas, and rituals. Structures and processes reinforce each other and are solidifed by formal and informal institutions.

 Why do processes and practices matter for policies and programs? They matter because they affect the actions and behaviors of dominant and subordinated groups, of service providers, and of the state itself. Groups who are historically excluded, on their part, may respond in different ways. One possibility is that they “opt out” or reject the terms on which they are included. Excluded groups, therefore, may drop out of school or the labor market or disengage from political processes. A second and related possibility is that grievances may accumulate, creating social tensions and having long-term costs for the economy and society. A third possibility is that groups who feel excluded organize themselves into formidable lobbies and use the political space to demand change. Historically, this choice has led to movements toward social inclusion (chapter 4); this is discussed in greater detail in the next chapter. In one way or another, processes and structures have a strong bearing on feelings and perceptions of individuals and groups with consequent effect on actions and behaviors. In our quest to leave no one behind, attain universal access, eradicate extreme poverty, and promote peace and stability, we need to be cognizant of behaviors. Yet, even though we know that belief systems, feelings, and perceptions affect behaviors, measuring and interpreting these systems and the underlying affective foundations is a complex undertaking that requires a deep understanding of the context as well as robust data and analytic tools. 
The second part of this chapter uses data from recent surveys to highlight some of 
the ways in which individuals and groups across African countries perceive their own lives and the world around them. Subjective indicators of well-being and of feelings and perceptions need to be used and interpreted carefully, fraught as they are with measurement challenges. The responses to questions depend on a variety of related and unrelated factors and events, and context is important. The same response in one country may mean something quite different in another. 
Legal, Administrative, and Social Structures 
Legal Structures 
Discriminatory laws that place implicit or explicit barriers on groups can stymie 
their ability, opportunity, and dignity. In South Africa, the legal exclusion of black South Africans from education and labor markets predates apartheid. The 1913 Natives Land Act (and related acts) prevented self-employment of black people in agriculture. The Native Urban Areas Act suppressed other forms of entrepreneurial activity by black South Africans in urban areas, including in trade and manufacturing. These barriers to entrepreneurial activity help explain why, for instance, the informal sector in South Africa remains smaller than that of other countries in the region. In the same vein, the Job Reservation and Colour Bar Acts
2 reserved many skilled and semiskilled jobs for white South Africans. 
Legal regulations in the education sector further enshrined the exclusion of black 
88 CHAPTER 3 HOW DOES SOCIAL EXCLUSION PLAY OUT IN AFRICA?   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
  
 
 
 South Africans. Through the 1953 Bantu Education Act, the syllabus was designed deliberately to de-emphasize basic skills in arithmetic and language so as to train black South Africans as unskilled laborers who would not compete with white employees (World Bank 2018f, 13). 
As noted earlier, the legacy of colonialism has played a major part in the 
structure and function of legal systems. For instance, 75 percent of countries in Francophone Africa have regulations restricting women’s employment that draw on a 1954 ordinance from the former federation of French West Africa. Among these countries are Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, Guinea, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal. Similarly, the legacies of Portuguese and Spanish rule have marked many former colonies. Portugal frst introduced a series of decrees restricting women’s work in the 1890s that stayed in effect in some form until the early 2000s. Currently, almost every country in Lusophone Africa (and Brazil) has at least one restriction on women’s work. Similar examples exist in the former Spanish colonies (World Bank 2018g), although many of these retrogressive laws are being dismantled in both former colonizing and former colonized countries. 
The extent of criminalization of same-sex relations and attitudes toward people 
of different sexual orientation or gender identity (SOGI) also refect the colonial history. For instance, Han and O’Mahoney (2014) analyze the variation in laws that criminalize same-sex relations across 185 countries and fnd that former British colonies are more likely to have criminalizing laws in place. Former British colonies in Africa are no exception to this pattern. In many Eastern and Southern African countries that were colonized by Britain, same-sex sexual acts are punishable (fgures 3.1 and 3.2). In contrast, former French colonies, mostly in Central and Western Africa, are less likely to have such criminalizing laws.
3 Seventeen 
of the 45 countries surveyed by UNAIDS (2018b) have either never had laws penalizing same-sex sexual acts or have decriminalized such acts. The majority of these countries are in Central Africa, with some in Western Africa: Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Mali, and Niger. Some countries in Southern Africa also do not criminalize same-sex sexual acts: Madagascar, Mozambique, Rwanda, and South Africa. Mauritania continues to criminalize same-sex sexual acts with the death penalty. Finally, most countries do not criminalize transgender people at all. Globally, much of the improvement in laws related to SOGI over the past few years has been in Africa. 
In addition to their underpinning in the colonial past, laws may refect long-held 
societal values, prejudices, and proclivities. Figures 3.1 and 3.2 lay out the extent of penalization for acts that go against some “moral values” of a society. For instance, in some countries, drug use, possession of drugs for personal use, and female sex

 work attract the highest penalties, as do nondisclosure of HIV positive status and transmission of the disease. Some of these laws are responses to the HIV epidemic. However, in other places, the information campaigns and demystifcation of the HIV epidemic have led to the loosening of laws against same-sex relations. In other cases, laws may be more progressive and inclusive than existing societal mores and may be social change agents. For example, same-sex sexual acts are not considered criminal in either Rwanda or South Africa, but attitudes toward “homosexual neighbors”
4 vary starkly across the two countries. Rwanda has the highest 
prevalence of negative attitudes toward homosexuality among African countries surveyed by the World Values Survey (WVS), while South Africa demonstrates the lowest prevalence of such attitudes. 
Finally, laws that derive from custom and religion also may be responsible for 
unequal and discriminatory treatment of some groups. Depending on region or ethnicity, traditional land tenure systems can vary within countries (for Guinea-Bissau, World Bank 2016d, 30; for South Sudan, Marzatico 2014, 4). Although global data on women’s land ownership are limited, women in several countries face serious barriers to ownership (Wellenstein and Stanley 2018). In Guinea-Bissau, land is administered exclusively by the male head of household or family clan (chefe de tabanca or regulado). Women’s land use rights are acquired through birth in their family of descent or through marriage and usually are given only for subsistence horticulture. When a woman separates from her husband, she loses all of her land rights, including those of her family of descent (World Bank 2016d, 30). In South Sudan, customary land tenure continues to restrict women’s ability to own land independently of their husbands or male relatives despite formal land provisions that sought to establish women’s equal rights to land and property (Marzatico 2014, 8, 15). 
Privileging certain cultures and knowledge systems at the expense of others 
intensifes asymmetrical information and affects the ability, opportunity, and dignity of subordinated groups. The tension between knowledge systems of the majority and the minority is well documented in health service provision. “Traditional” or “folk” knowledge systems may be overlooked, and “modern” systems imposed upon minority groups, who then may well decide not to take part in the health system. Based on a study of maternal and neonatal health care in rural northern Ghana, Hill and others (2014) point out that despite a pluralistic medical system that incorporated traditional and allopathic providers, tensions prevailed. Many allopathic providers were found to be disconnected from the culture of the communities in which they practiced, whereas traditional providers were more in tune with local cultural practices. The two systems of medicine sometimes also came into confict. A large body of literature highlights the fact that ignoring indigenous systems of knowledge can have deleterious effects on several outcomes, including health, educational attainment, agricultural output, and adoption of new technologies. 
92 CHAPTER 3 HOW DOES SOCIAL EXCLUSION PLAY OUT IN AFRICA?   
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
    
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
   In the case of education, too, the language of instruction can have great impact on the ability of minority students to succeed in school. A more radical strand of the literature argues that appropriation of knowledge systems has been a tool to solidify social exclusion and to colonize the “ways of knowing” (Belenky and others 1986), constituting an exclusion from spaces that are signifed by knowledge, power, status, and authority. By the same token, respect for indigenous systems of knowledge can enhance the dignity and respect accorded to indigenous peoples with the important positive ramifcations of social inclusion. 
Bureaucracies, with their rules, procedures, and ethos, can exclude or include some 
individuals and groups. Consider this scenario: an indigenous woman who lives in a remote village and needs a disability certifcate may have to go into a district offce in a nearby town. She may not speak the dominant language, may not know her way around, may be intimidated by the formal offce and its culture, and may have no idea what documents she needs to bring to secure the certifcate. Documents of various kinds are indispensable to access services. Proof of identity, for instance, can enable or stymie inclusion in markets, services, and spaces. Documents that establish and other information have perhaps become more important today than they were a decade ago. With greater formalization of governmental systems and procedures, individuals need proof of residence to show that they are eligible to buy and sell property and generally to participate in business and society. 
Data from the World Bank Identifcation for Development (ID4D) project
5 show 
that, in Sub-Saharan Africa, those who did not have an account in a fnancial 
institution were especially likely to cite documentation requirements as barriers to set up such accounts. The global average for citing documentation as a barrier to fnancial inclusion is at 20 percent. However, the average is signifcantly higher in Zambia (35 percent), the Philippines (45 percent), and Zimbabwe (49 percent) (Demirgüç-Kunt and others 2018, 40). On average, only 56 percent of adult Africans who lack an account at a fnancial institution reported having government-issued identifcation, compared with an average of 85 percent in developing countries globally. But securing relevant documents often can be a challenge because some groups may not be able to navigate administrative rules and procedures or understand the etiquette required when dealing with administrative functionaries; or they may run into accessibility barriers. Government offces or banks that are not accessible and instructions that are published only in the dominant language have the potential to exclude a large number of individuals. 
Marriage and Familial Structures 
Across the world, social structures, hierarchies, and norms underpin power relations 
within the household and the community and can strongly infuence the ability of individuals and groups to access opportunities. Structures and rules of tribe, clan, and kinship can exert heavy pressure to maintain customs and behaviors and, in 
INCLUSION MATTERS IN AFRICA 93    
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
  turn, determine outcomes. These structures and rules often have been infuenced by colonial rule and postcolonial history. A strong body of anthropological literature sheds light on these structures. For instance, in many regions, women are dependent on their husbands or elders regarding the extent to which they can access health care and higher education, whether they can seek market work, and how much leisure time they have. Parental or other familial permission plays a strong role for young men as well. Figures 3.1 and 3.2 showed that several countries require adolescents to get parental permission before they can be tested for HIV/AIDS. Similarly, age at marriage for both men and women often is dictated by family and kin. Such controls have a strong infuence on the extent to which less powerful individuals in the family can access markets, services, and spaces. On the other hand, kinship structures can also have salutary effects on inclusion. 
As in many other parts of the world, in most African countries, marriage is an 
important symbol of status, security, and social acceptance. Marriage also affects social inclusion in complex ways. In chapter 2, we discuss some nuances of marital status and sex of household head and their relationship with household poverty. Take also the case of ex-combatants in the Great Lakes Region (GLR): Uganda, Rwanda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, and Burundi. Based on survey data collected between 2010 and 2012 from nearly 10,000 ex-combatants and community members, Rhea (2014) fnds that marriage is a core component of social reintegration in the GLR. Marriage is a critical pathway through which ex-combatants extend their familial networks and signal a shift in identity to the community. Marriage also serves as a pathway for access to land, an important indicator of economic stability because most ex-combatants return to work in small-scale agriculture. Although, contrary to popular belief, ex-combatants generally are accepted by their family networks upon returning to their communities, they still have less familial contact overall and are less likely to marry, compared to other community members. Female ex-combatants, although generally accepted back into existing kinship networks, are the group least likely to be married; and most likely to be divorced, separated, or widowed. Over time, male ex-combatants in the GLR have seen improved marriage rates, but the rates for female ex-combatants are near stagnant. Their hyper-exposure to (sexual) violence during confict contributes to the stigma of female ex-combatants. In some parts of the GLR, this stigma is so strong that some women avoid self-identifying as ex-combatants and forfeit their entitlement to the assistance that is targeted to ex-combatants. 
There are other ways in which marriage and its dissolution, although important 
for both men and women, has varying forms and connotations. Overall, African men spend much more of their lifetime married than do African women; women are more likely to stay widowed or divorced. There may be several causes, including the higher life expectancy of women. If marriage confers status, its

 breakdown confers disadvantage. Women’s continued single status after marital dissolution or widowhood has implications for their inclusion in markets, services, and spaces.
6 Drawing on Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data for Mali 
between 1996 and 2006, van de Walle (2013) shows that widowhood (including the prior widowhood of currently married women) is correlated with lower living standards. Drawing on more recent DHS data (2004–2013), Djuikom and van de Walle (2018) further fnd that widows and divorcées have worse nutritional status
7 than do married women in both urban and rural areas.8 The detrimental 
effects of widowhood and divorce also are passed along intergenerationally (van de Walle 2013). 
Finally, early marriage deserves special mention because of its impact on the lives 
of girls and women over their lifetimes. Although early marriage also affects boys and men, the negative effects are different and possibly not as limiting as they are for girls and women. When girls are married too early, they are less likely to attend primary and secondary school, and more likely to be engaged in home care or work. For married girls, outcomes are particularly poor. Compared to boys of similar age, the ratio of married girls fnishing primary school is 1:5; and of enrolling in secondary school, 3:5. Low educational attainment of girls and young women is particularly costly for both individuals and societies. Girls dropping out of school early are more likely to marry and have children early, sometimes leading to adverse outcomes for their own and their children’s health. Additionally, because younger women have lower levels of agency than older ones, they also are more vulnerable to intimate partner violence (Wodon and others 2017). Therefore, the relationship between early marriage and poor outcomes is mutually reinforcing. 
Processes of Exclusion Across the world, belief systems, superstitions, stigmas, and other practices 
present formidable barriers to the inclusion of certain groups. Intimidation and harassment instill fear that prevents some groups from reaching their full potential and “keeps them in their place.” Social norms may assign males and females to certain occupations or may render some practices “unclean.” Other practices such as stigma and shunning may render some groups, like persons with disabilities, invisible. Relatedly, some cultures may actively hide persons with disabilities. This lack of visibility can have several consequences, including not counting these groups in offcial statistics. Thus, they remain hidden and unattended to by both their families and at national level. Often, these exclusionary processes are sanctifed by religion or by those who interpret religious texts. Persons who have a nonconforming sexual identity are excluded to the point of being criminalized in many cultures. Taboos surrounding menstruating women are common in many parts of the world; beliefs of purity and pollution exclude certain groups at certain times or at all times. Overall, these practices are mechanisms to enforce social order and control.

The case of persons with albinism9 is instructive. Superstitions surrounding  
these individuals can have life and death consequences. Box 2.2 in chapter 2  
highlights their poorer human capital outcomes; these outcomes are underpinned  
by processes and practices. In many parts of Africa, persons with albinism are  
targeted for brutal attacks in the name of witchcraft and superstition (Cruz-Inigo  
and others 2011; UNGA 2013).  Widespread ignorance of the genetic origin of  
albinism helps sustain myths surrounding it, prevents persons with albinism  
from receiving adequate health care, and hinders the prevention of disease (Cruz-
Inigo and others 2011). Children with albinism may be avoided and neglected by  
family members and/or ridiculed, threatened, or harmed at school. Mothers of  
children with albinism may be condemned due to the “uncertain ancestry” of the  
child, or other superstitions surrounding the condition.  A study in Nigeria found  
individuals with albinism to be more withdrawn from social situations to avoid  
being noticed,  less emotionally stable,  and less assertive than persons without  
albinism. Persons with albinism also were more likely to consider their society  
to be unkind and rejecting (Cruz-Inigo and others 2011; Hong and others 2006;  
Lund 2001). 
Similarly, the stigma of HIV is still strong in many parts of the world. Not only  
the persons living with HIV but also the surviving children of HIV/AIDS-affected  
parents may be treated with hostility, with the latter being left without adequate  
adult support (Bourdillon 2017). Figure 3.3 shows the differences across three  
countries in reports by gay men and female sex workers (two groups associated  
with higher susceptibility to HIV/AIDS) of avoiding health care in the past 12  
96 CHAPTER 3 HOW DOES SOCIAL EXCLUSION PLAY OUT IN AFRICA?  INCLUSION MATTERS IN AFRICA 97 months due to stigma and discrimination.  The extent of stigma against HIV/AIDS  
does not always correlate with the legal status of SOGI. Cameroon and Côte  
d’Ivoire show very high levels of stigma whereas Guinea shows very low levels. In  
contrast, nonconforming sexual identity is criminalized in Guinea and Cameroon  
but not in Côte d’Ivoire.  Additionally, laws do not always refect societal attitudes.  
In sum, although stigma and discrimination against HIV-affected persons are high  
in Africa, they also are widely prevalent across the world, including in OECD  
(Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries.  A study  
assessing self-reported HIV-related discrimination in European health care  
settings (Nöstlinger and others 2014) found that 32 percent of respondents had  
experienced HIV-related discrimination in the three prior years, and almost half  
of them felt that they had been discriminated against by health care providers. 
Violence is one of the gravest manifestations of exclusion and a mechanism to  
show subordinate groups “their place.” Physical offensives often are justifed by  
an intricate set of beliefs and taboos that serve to create a “logic of exclusion” that  
also may be sanctifed by religion. For example, many religions regard a woman’s  
place as being in the home and may implicitly or explicitly condone violence  
against women who dare to transgress this norm.  Although there has been change  
over time,  overall,  the acceptance of domestic violence against women in Africa  
remains high. Beegle and others (2016) fnd that that from 2000–2006 to 2007– 
2013, acceptance of domestic violence by women in Africa declined by almost

 10 percentage points. However, averaging 30 percent, acceptance of domestic 
violence in the region is still exceptionally high and more than twice the average in the rest of the developing world (14 percent). There is, however, considerable heterogeneity across African countries. Whereas in Mali and Uganda, 77 percent of women condone violence, only 13 percent in Malawi and 16 percent in Benin do (fgure 3.4). Some practices, such as female genital mutilation (FGM), which hold cultural value for some groups, also are examples of violence and extreme forms of exclusion, with devastating effects on health, education, and life chances of women and girls. FGM can have direct effects on reproductive and mental health and cause infectious disease. Sanctifed and upheld by religion and culture, FGM serves to solidify the subordinated status of women and girls. The practice matters in and of itself without doubt, but it also matters because it curtails the ability, opportunity, and dignity of survivors. In the long term, FGM affects the ways that survivors accumulate human capital and their future earnings. 
Attitudes about Society and Social Inclusion 
Societal attitudes about subordinated groups or minorities are another marker 
of the extent of inclusion and bring to the surface entrenched prejudices and stereotypes. The World Values Surveys contain questions about groups whom respondents would not like to have as neighbors, including immigrants/foreign workers, “homosexuals,”
10 people of a different religion, and people who speak 
a different language.11 The panels in fgures 3.5 and 3.6 report the tabulated 
answers to these questions and compare some African countries with other OECD and non-OECD countries. Negative attitudes toward sexual minorities are high across the world and pervasive in some African countries (fgure 3.5, panel a). In Rwanda and Zimbabwe, for example, 88 percent of respondents reported not wanting a “homosexual neighbor”; this is more negative than in certain countries in the Middle East and North Africa, such as Iraq, Morocco, Qatar, and Turkey. Among African countries included in the WVS, South Africa displays the lowest level of antipathy toward sexual minorities; here the proportion of respondents who would not want a “homosexual neighbor” stands at 38 percent, similar to some European countries, including Poland (38 percent) and Slovenia (35 percent). 
African countries seem to display greater acceptance of persons belonging to a 
different religion or speaking a different language, and immigrants or foreign workers, than they do of sexual minorities (fgures 3.5 and 3.6). This pattern also is seen in other regions. Interestingly, some African countries that demonstrate the least tolerant attitudes toward “homosexuals” (namely, Rwanda and Zimbabwe) are the most accepting of persons of a different religion or different language. Less than 10 percent of respondents in Rwanda and Zimbabwe would reject a neighbor of a different religion or language, making Rwanda similar to Colombia, New Zealand, and Sweden in this respect. By contrast, over 20 percent of Ghanaians

 and Nigerians would not like a neighbor who belonged to a different religion or language, on par with countries like Cyprus, Estonia, Republic of Korea, and Pakistan. South Africa, where respondents report the least negative attitudes toward sexual minorities, demonstrates the most negative attitudes toward immigrants or foreign workers. Forty-three percent of South Africans do not want such a neighbor, on par with the Republic of Korea and Qatar. In contrast, Ghana and Nigeria, at 21 and 20 percent, respectively, display attitudes similar to those of Germany and the Netherlands (fgure 3.6). Attitudes are notoriously diffcult to capture and to interpret and can refect recent events or localized occurrences. This report cannot draw generalized conclusions about the degree of inclusion in a country based on such attitudes. These attitudes do, however, provide nuance and shine a light on which groups are likely to be excluded. 
Attitudes affect outcomes, but the relationship between the two is not clear cut. 
Take the case of attitudes about higher education for women (fgure 3.7). Countries in which attitudes toward university education for females are retrogressive tend to have lower gross female tertiary education enrollment. The World Values Surveys ask respondents whether they think university education is more important for boys than for girls. Combined with data from the World Development Indicators (WDI) on gross female tertiary enrollment,
12 the results in general suggest a 
clear negative relationship. The higher the percentage of respondents who think university education is more important for boys than for girls, the lower the gross female tertiary enrollment rates. In the Netherlands, New Zealand, Slovenia, and Sweden, for instance, discriminatory attitudes toward female access to higher education are very low: almost no one in these countries believes that men should have greater access to higher education than women. Female gross enrollment in tertiary education is at 76 percent (Netherlands), 83 percent (Sweden), 95 percent (New Zealand), and 104 percent (Slovenia).
13 By contrast, in  India, Pakistan, and 
Uzbekistan, approximately or more than 50 percent of respondents believe that university education is more important for boys than for girls, and female tertiary enrollment rates are approximately or below 20 percent. Although there is a clear global pattern suggesting a negative relationship between attitudes and enrollment, data from the fve African countries for which this indicator was available on the WVS show that the relationship is not clear. Only 15 percent of respondents expressed the view that university education is more important for boys in Zimbabwe, compared to 28 percent in Ghana, 36 percent in Rwanda, 38 percent in South Africa, and 42 percent in Nigeria. Yet, gross female tertiary enrollment varies much less across these countries. In fact, female tertiary enrollment is lower in Zimbabwe (at 5 percent) than in the other countries, despite its more favorable attitude toward female education. However, the number of African countries for which data are available for this indicator in the WVS is too few to draw any inferences about a regional pattern.

 Feelings of Belonging and Attitudes toward the State 
Feelings of belonging can indicate the extent that people feel included in different 
groups and institutions. Belonging to an ethnic group can create affnity and comfort among members. In the same vein, expressing affnity with a national identity is an indication that respondents feel connected to their country. The Afrobarometer 2014/2015 asked respondents who disclosed their ethnic identities at the beginning of the survey if they regarded their national or their ethnic identity as more important. The results are instructive (fgure 3.8). Only a small minority of respondents appeared to give precedence to their ethnic identity alone. Over 70 percent of respondents from Eswatini, Guinea, Madagascar, Niger, and São Tomé and Príncipe regarded their national group to be more important that their ethnic group. By contrast, in Botswana, Lesotho, Liberia, Mauritius, and Uganda, nearly or over 70 percent of respondents felt that being a member of their ethnic group and of their national group was of equal importance. Feelings of national or ethnic identity may be driven by several factors, related to the extent of pluralism or of competition in society, the history of the nation-state or of confict, and the current political milieu. It also is possible that these questions elicit socially or politically acceptable responses. Thus, the responses should not be taken as “truths” and must be interpreted with caution. 
There appears to be widespread discontent with the state across Africa. This 
disaffection is apparent in several countries in newspaper columns, social media, and casual conversations. It also is refected in perception surveys. Afrobarometer 2014–2015 asked respondents how often they feel that people in their country are being treated unequally “under the law” (that is, by the state). Their responses likely indicate the extent of their grievances and feelings of injustice and exclusion. Figure 3.9 presents the results. There are, as expected, large variations across African countries; Botswana and Namibia stand out as countries in which almost 60 percent of the respondents felt that people were never or rarely treated unequally under the law. In Malawi, Mauritius, and Tanzania, about half or a little more of the respondents felt that unequal treatment under the law was never or rarely manifested. At the other end of spectrum, in Mali and São Tomé and Príncipe, over half the respondents felt that unequal treatment under the law was always manifested. Overall, in most countries, more than half the respondents felt that people were treated unequally under the law often or always. It also is telling that, in some countries, notably Lesotho and Sierra Leone, over 10 percent of the respondents did not answer the question. 
When the majority of citizens feel that people in their country are treated 
unequally, it often points to elite capture. In other words, the state is perceived as catering to the needs of a small section of society. In this situation, exclusion is not a minority issue but affects many or most citizens. Several recent World Bank

Systematic Country Diagnostics (SCDs) in Africa identify elite capture and a lack  
of public trust as important obstacles to the delivery of inclusive services and a  
stable social contract more broadly. See, for example, SCDs for Benin (World  
Bank 2017b); Guinea-Bissau (World Bank 2016d); Liberia (World Bank 2018e);  
and Madagascar (World Bank 2015).  Other surveys and anecdotal evidence also  
point to perceptions that the state and its institutions are opaque and that they  
beneft only a few.  A perception survey conducted by the Pew Research Center  
found that 64 percent of Kenyans, 63 percent of Nigerians, and 69 percent of  
South Africans surveyed felt that many jobs go to people with connections (Wike  
and others 2016).

  Hope and Optimism 
Despite serious misgivings about their economies and often about their governments, 
evidence is emerging that people living in several African countries have high levels of optimism. For instance, as part of the Pew Research Center’s Spring 2017 Global Attitudes Survey, roughly half of Africans (median of 49 percent) and Latin Americans (48 percent) surveyed said their day was “particularly good” whereas other regions overwhelmingly described their day as “typical” (fgure 3.10).
14 Similarly, Graham 
and Hoover (2006), based on Afrobarometer data, found levels of optimism in Africa that surpassed other regions, with particularly high levels of optimism among the poorest and most insecure respondents, who had high hopes for the future of their children. In keeping with this fnding, the Liberia SCD (World Bank 2018e) cites a 2014 survey that found that most Liberians believed that their country was headed in the right direction, driven in part, by Liberia’s return to relative peace and stability. The SCD also notes, however, that as the recent confict fades into the past, Liberians are likely to have increasing expectations from their government (World Bank 2018e, 72). 
Similar optimism is visible in other survey results. For example, ex-combatants 
in the GLR, despite perceiving themselves as being worse off than community members overall (perceptions that are corroborated by community members), have a positive outlook for their futures and understand that social change occurs over a long period. Interestingly, despite being disadvantaged on nearly all indicators of social and economic reintegration, female ex-combatants report a stronger sense of overall happiness, a stronger sense of overall life satisfaction, and a better outlook for the future than do male ex-combatants. The female ex-combatants also express a higher sense of empowerment and control in their lives and everyday activities than do other women. In Burkina Faso, national consultations, including a telephone survey conducted by the World Bank in October 2016 (World Bank 2017a), found that although the majority (55 percent) of respondents believed that the economic situation in 2016 was worse than at any other point in the past decade, larger numbers (73 percent) believed that the situation would improve in the years to come (fgure 3.11; World Bank 2017a, viii). In Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa, the Pew Research Center found that, despite overall discontent with the economy, respondents were optimistic about the future. 
Approximately 60 percent in each of these three countries said that they expected 
health care and education to be better for the next generation and that the economy would improve in the 12 months following the survey. Furthermore, over 75 percent of those surveyed said that young people who wanted a bright future should stay in the country rather than emigrate (Pew Research Center 2016).

 Concluding Refections 
Chapter 3 shows the ways in which social exclusion plays out—the structures 
and processes that aid and abet its impact. It also draws attention to attitudes and perceptions as they pertain to generalized views about social inclusion and exclusion. It shows that social structures and processes—both formal and informal—affect social exclusion in myriad ways. These structures and processes are mechanisms that uphold and solidify social exclusion. If we can make a dent in them, we have moved closer to social inclusion. Therefore, it is important to understand how these formal and informal mechanisms can impede the best efforts of governments and societies. 
Feelings and perceptions may be diffcult to measure, but they can matter for 
policy and practice in much the same way that polls matter for politicians during an election or that score cards matter for service delivery. In tandem with robust impact evaluations and administrative data, feelings and perceptions can gauge the extent to which existing policies are accomplishing their objectives. In some cases, an evaluation may show that a policy is successful, but people’s perception of it may be negative. In other cases, perception data provide government with information about how implementing bodies and service providers are being perceived and what policy or implementation tweaks may lead to greater success. A survey of perceptions also can help governments create a better communication plan, instill confdence among citizens, and show that governments care. In sum, if we understand the conduits through which exclusion plays out, we are in a better place to design policies and programs that will strengthen inclusion. 
Attitudes and prejudices in African countries resemble those in other countries. 
The relationship between attitudes and objective outcomes in African countries is not always clear cut, but attitudes can indicate areas of exclusion. Finally, large groups of people feel left out by the state and the elites. These groups are disenchanted with the state, but this feeling does not seem to affect their overall outlook. Evidence from different sources points to heightened hope and optimism across many African countries.

6 Over 80 percent of men between their early 30s and early 80s are married. By contrast, the share of married women peaks approximately age 30 and then drops below 80 percent just after age 40. By age 65, there are as many widowed women as married women, and 80 percent of women are widowed by age 80. The number of divorced also is higher for women than for men at all ages (Djuikom and van de Walle 2018).

  13 Gross enrollment ratio is the ratio of total enrollment, regardless of age, to the 
population of the age group who offcially corresponds to the level of education shown. This explains why percentages can exceed 100. Gross enrollment ratios indicate the capacity of each level of the education system, but a high ratio may refect a substantial number of over-age children enrolled in each grade because of repetition or late entry rather than a successful education system. The net enrollment rate excludes over- age and under-age students and more accurately captures the system’s coverage and internal effciency. Differences between the gross enrollment ratio and the net enrollment rate show the incidence of over- age and under-age enrollments. See https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.TER.ENRR.FE.

 Toward Greater Inclusion 
in Africa 
There will be failures along the way, for the world will not 
change overnight. But we have seen change in our lifetimes, and the world will continue to change in ways that affect us all.
1 
—Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, 2011 
Africa has made enormous progress toward economic 
development and social inclusion, as previous chapters have shown. This progress testifes to a truism: change toward social inclusion is possible. The innovations, policies, and programs in Africa serve as lessons across countries in the continent and for other regions grappling with similar issues. In some cases, change is inevitable. But it can also be painful and diffcult. Change is always complex and political and may create new excluded groups. For instance, the focus on female secondary education in many countries, notably in the Caribbean, meant that boys at the secondary level were left behind. In other cases, where refugees have settled in large numbers and have come with higher human capital endowments than their host communities, the hosts have felt afraid and anxious about jobs, services, and voice. Social inclusion is not a linear process. Progress can stall for unanticipated reasons, but it may pick up again. Groups who once were disempowered may gain power and upstage earlier dominant groups, who in turn may work to impede progress toward social inclusion because it hurts their interests. Social inclusion is, as World Bank (2013) states, always work in progress.

 Investing in social inclusion must be a conscious choice by societies and governments, begun with a clear understanding of the costs and benefts. Investing in an inclusive society is not free and needs concerted action to transform the investment into a win for all. Social programs, for instance, can be expensive and have an impact on fscal sustainability. Governments often need to make trade-offs, either by cutting costs on other initiatives or by raising taxes.There may be political costs as well, as initiatives that focus on historically excluded groups can upset power relations. Governments and politicians need to craft clear social contracts with citizens to ensure support for social inclusion. There are examples the world over of citizens willing to pay for a more inclusive society. The most powerful form of support is through the fscal realm, whereby citizens pay taxes that they know will fund policies and programs for greater social inclusion. In Brazil, Mexico, and Nepal, for instance, there is strong support for social protection programs; and in Bangladesh, poverty reduction is recognized as a national priority, with the elite supporting antipoverty initiatives (Hossain and Moore 1999). 
How does change take place? Who are the main actors? What are the channels 
through which progress toward social inclusion is achieved? What can we learn for the future and for the countries that want to make greater progress? We draw from the World Bank’s social inclusion framework (World Bank 2013) and address inclusion in markets, services, and spaces. Inclusion how? Here we 
repeat what we state earlier in this report: by raising the ability, opportunity, and 
dignity of individuals and groups most likely to be left out. Chapter 4 outlines some of the policy and program efforts that other African countries are making to pursue social inclusion. Because documenting process can help others in their quests to design workable solutions, this report focuses on some innovations and solutions that African countries have tried. Chapter 4 has two parts: the frst focuses on the actors who drive change and the second on interventions in the form of policies, programs, and projects that have been implemented or for which there are impacts to share. 
Who Drives Change, and How? 
Multiple actors and processes can lead to change toward social inclusion, but the state has the preeminent responsibility and is the dominant actor (World Bank 2013). 
The preeminent role of the state as the driver and propeller of change towards inclusion is well recognized. It can intervene for social inclusion through three conduits. The frst is to create an enabling environment for social inclusion, such that citizens have the freedom to exercise their choice and to innovate for better outcomes and processes. The second is to design legislation, policy and programs 
114 CHAPTER 4 TOWARD GREATER INCLUSION IN AFRICA   
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 that directly or indirectly affect social inclusion. The third is to ensure 
implementation and enforcement of the legal and policy framework. All these roles are underpinned by the nature of the state, the degree of openness of the polity and the vision that the state and citizens share. The strength of both formal and informal institutions is critical for the success of state-led actions. 
—World Bank 2013, 200 
There are other important drivers of change toward social inclusion in Africa, as elsewhere. These drivers include a host of nonstate actors: religious groups, NGOs, the private sector, and, most importantly, organizations of historically subordinated groups. Lasting change usually comes when state and nonstate actors join forces. Elites often are part of both state and nonstate actions and play a critical role in propelling social inclusion. The importance of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in many parts of the continent presents an interesting example. What started as attention to a public health emergency quickly moved to identifying affected groups. They included, among others, gay and bisexual men and other men who have sex with men (MSM), widows, and orphans. The attention to sexual orientation in many African countries was legitimized because it was linked to a public health crisis, and groups previously invisible were rendered visible. This is not to say that stigma no longer exists, and sometimes the stigma may only have changed form. Nevertheless, the epidemic was a catalyst. It presented an opportunity that enabled previously excluded groups to mobilize and be partners in the change that policy and programs propelled. Through the process of attacking the epidemic, governments and civil society co-opted elites and community members alike. Box 4.1 shows that the stigma against shopkeepers who had HIV decreased considerably in Eastern and Southern Africa. 
Regardless of which actor sponsors a program that is intended to promote social 
inclusion, few programs can succeed without community ownership. Communities that own the movement toward social inclusion and can visualize a new society for themselves are most likely to be invested in the success of such programs. Relatedly, the accountability of the state and service providers to citizens and communities often forms the crux of success. Conversely, when programs are designed without community involvement or are top down, they may take longer to take off and even face resistance from the community. The process of abolishing female genital mutilation (FGM) in Burkina Faso is an illustrative case (box 4.2). Together with criminalizing the practice in 1997, the government implemented a broad array of measures that promoted community ownership of the change. In addition to training lawyers, judges, police, and security offcers to ensure their buy-in, the government supported “community patrols” who raised awareness of the harmful consequences of FGM and informed communities of its criminalization.

 Examples of communities driving change exist across the world in areas as diverse as reproductive health, education, infrastructure, environment, and employment, both in the context of decentralized governance and as standalone initiatives. The community-based rehabilitation (CBR) model for persons with disabilities is known to have positive outcomes, especially in remote areas. Various organizations have come together to build the CBR Africa Network (CAN) and sponsor several country-specifc and local initiatives. There are other examples as well. A review of the effectiveness of interventions that focus on gender-based violence (GBV) found that participatory, multiple stakeholder supported discussion around gender relationships and the acceptability of violence encouraged shared decision-making among family members and nonviolent behavior and tended to show great success (Ellsberg and others 2015). One way to secure ownership by communities is to give them the power to make local decisions and set budget priorities for themselves. Box 4.3 highlights the case of participatory budgeting in West Pokot in the wake of Kenya’s thrust toward devolution. Also of note is the Local Governance and Service Delivery Project (LOGOSEED) in South Sudan, which engages communities to ensure that project investments refect their needs and that service delivery transcends social divisions. In its mobilization process, the project focuses on reaching diverse ethnic groups, women, youth, persons with disabilities, displaced people, and returnees (Vemuru and Karim 2017). 
High levels of within-community trust and social capital are likely to be associated 
with support for programs that promote social inclusion. Rhea (2014) describes the successful reintegration of ex-combatants across the Great Lakes Region (GLR) and the positive role that communities play.Although community members consistently reported high levels of fear regarding the return of ex-combatants before their arrival, few report having such fears after the ex-combatants return. Community members surveyed described positive contributions that ex-combatants make to communities, and both community members and ex-combatants tended to report high levels of overall trust in the community and improvement in trust over time. In Democratic Republic of Congo, in contrast to other countries in the GLR, both ex-combatants and community members perform weaker across almost all indicators of reintegration processes. A core challenge in the Democratic Republic of Congo is that communities display weaker levels of social capital and social cohesion. The broader societal shift toward peace and development that appears to have catalyzed ex-combatants’ reintegration in other GLR countries is diminished in the context of continued local violence and insecurity in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Therefore, programs that also invest in building community cohesion and trust are likely to show better results than those that proceed from an assumption that communities are a panacea to intractable problems.

(DHS); Continuous Multisectoral Survey (EMC); and Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS). Burkina Faso data is from the 2015 EMC conducted by the National Institute of Statistics and Demography in Burkina Faso.  Burkina Faso has seen the most striking drop in female genital mutilation (FGM) 
over the decades of 2000 and 2010 (figure B4.2.1). But the first efforts to end FGM go back a long time and were not particularly successful to start. Catholic missionaries during colonization tried unsuccessfully to put an end to FGM by threatening to excommunicate those who practiced it, and under the First Republic in the 1960s awareness-raising campaigns against the practice were met with strong resistance by the traditional and customary chieftainship. 
Several developments in the late 1970s began to garner support for abolishing 
FGM and highlight the role of partnerships between civil society, government, the judiciary, and communities. These included the denunciation of FGM by nongovernmental organizations, women’s associations, and the media; a national radio broadcast condemning FGM and disseminating information of the harm done by the practice; and a series of governmental anti-FGM campaigns and seminars covered by national radio, television, and newspapers from the 1980s onward. The government then institutionalized the fight against FGM by establishing an interministerial committee in 1990, which was charged with coordinating resources and activities promoting the elimination of FGM in Burkina Faso. In 1997, FGM was criminalized in Burkina Faso, and the implementation of the law has since been accompanied by stronger enforcement as well as normative change. These measures have included training lawyers, judges, police, and security officers to become advocates against FGM; sending patrols into communities to raise awareness of harmful consequences and of the criminalization of the practice; as well as the translation of the law into local languages, wide distribution of the law in communities, and establishment of a telephone hotline for people to anonymously report cases of FGM. Even before criminalization of FGM, there was a national telephone helpline called “SOS Excision” that people could call to report cases; approximately 70 percent of cases before the courts start with a tip via this phone line. Cases also are reported at police stations and customs offices, through religious leaders and local administrators, and directly to the Permanent Secretariat (SP) for the National Council for the Fight against the Practice of Excision (CNLPE). Table B4.2.1 details prevalence of FGM in several African countries.

INCLUSION MATTERS IN AFRICA 119    Box 4.3 Participatory Budgeting in West Pokot, Kenya 
After a nationwide mandate to devolve governance and increase civic 
participation in planning, budgeting, and service monitoring, West Pokot, a pastoral community in north Kenya, became one of the first counties to introduce participatory budgeting (PB). The initiative was part of the West Pokot government’s resolve to increase its citizen outreach and participation in the planning and budgeting process by moving meetings from the ward level to remote sublocations and encouraging the participation of women in a largely patriarchal society. 
In the West Pokot pastoral community women tend to defer to the decisions 
made by their male counterparts. This practice was reflected in past budget consultations, when very few women attended budget meetings. When women did attend, they sat separately from the men and endorsed the projects proposed by men without direct involvement. 
Following trainings in partnership with the World Bank in October 2015 and 
January 2016, the county government of West Pokot committed 32 percent of its development budget to be decided by citizens in PB meetings that specifically targeted women. The initial results and outcomes of the PB have been positive. Women’s participation in budget consultation meetings increased. Women prioritized improving maternal health care services, accessibility to water, and early childhood education. Men focused on improving roads, livestock and agricultural services and on the construction of cattle dips. The projects that citizens selected in the PB process are being implemented or are in the pipeline. 
The Kenya Participatory Budgeting Initiative (KPBI) is being implemented under 
the Kenya Accountable Devolution Program.

 Programs and Policies toward Social Inclusion: 
Refections on the African Experience 
Most countries in Africa, as elsewhere, have a plethora of policies, programs, and 
projects to advance social inclusion. These policies may be targeted to certain groups or areas, or they may be universal, accessible to everyone. The effectiveness of particular programs varies by country, context, and initiative. At the highest level, constitutions of most countries guarantee equality and basic freedoms. At the next level, broad-vision documents, manifestos, and pronouncements give a more defned indication of the priorities of a government. Further down are policies, which lay out directives and show the clearer path of a government’s focus on social inclusion. Many policies signal the groups whom they privilege, or ignore, by their silence on certain topics or groups or by the intensity of implementation of certain policies. So, although policies may not actively exclude individuals or groups, the policies may do so passively, either by not expressly indicating who is included or by not investing adequate resources or attention to implementation.
2 As pointed 
out earlier, many policies are political, and their implementation is even more so. Well-crafted policies have clear rules, guidelines, and implementation plans and mechanisms. Under policies, there often are programs that highlight reforms by sector or subsector. As previously described, the policy literature in Africa tends to focus on poverty reduction, response to humanitarian emergencies, and food security. In addition, and especially in countries and contexts wracked by confict, governments and donor partners have rightly focused on basic services, security, and livelihoods. This section refects on some of the policy and programmatic interventions that advance social inclusion, based on our defnition of it. 
How do policies in Africa deal with social identity, which often is fraught with 
political and social implications? 
There’s no dispensing with identities, but we need to understand them better if we can hope to reconfgure them, and free ourselves from mistakes about them that are often a couple of hundred years old. Much of what is dangerous about them has to do with the way identities—religion, nation, race, class, and culture—divide us and set us against one another.… They are the lies that bind. 
—Anthony Appiah, 2018. 
In contexts in which ethnicity or race has historically been implicated in divisions and tensions, or has been otherwise political, whether at the societal or national level, the state may consciously move away from an attention to ethnicity. Several 
INCLUSION MATTERS IN AFRICA 121    
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 countries in Africa have emphasized civic citizenship and national identity over 
ethnic or parochial identities. For instance, chapter 3 notes that the majority of those surveyed by the Afrobarometer tended to identify more with their national identities than their ethnic identities. Nevertheless, most countries address at least some identities––most commonly, gender, age, location, and occupation—via targeted programs or special provisions. Social protection programs are a case in point and are discussed later in this section. 
One way of focusing on specifc individuals or groups is through affrmative 
action or quotas. Special provisions for individuals and groups are common in OECD and non-OECD countries alike. Although sometimes controversial, especially in the context of stubborn group-based inequalities, affrmative action policies are still considered among the more effective policy mechanisms (Langer and others 2016). Many African countries have affrmative action policies for women and persons with disabilities. In its 1995 Constitution, Uganda enshrined a quota system for Parliament stating that Parliament should include a woman representative in every district, as well as representatives from the army, youth, workers, persons with disabilities, and “other groups as Parliament may defne” (Article 78). Similar provisions were made to ensure seats for women in local government (Muriaas and Wang 2012, 311). South Africa, of course, has the most prominent and comprehensive set of initiatives: 
While the Constitution of 1996 appeared to favor the ‘soft’ form of transformation through training and mentoring, the Employment Equity Act of 1998 focused on quotas, or targets: all employers of frms with more than 50 people have to ensure equitable representation of all race groups according to population demographics. Employers are required to give preferential treatment to black candidates. They also have to develop an “equity plan” for the Department of Labour, and there are fnes for not meeting targets. The broad-based black economic empowerment (BBBEE) legislation of 2007 also imposed quotas for black executives. (World Bank 2018f, 15) 
Some evidence suggests that affrmative action has had positive effects on wages and led to growing returns to education for black South African men (Burger and others 2016). A recent paper fnds tentative evidence from Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda that attitudes toward redistribution are favorable overall, suggesting that affrmative action policies may well have popular support in some African countries (Langer and others 2016). 
Another way to address social identities, sometimes referred to as “special groups,” 
is to nest a focus on them within universal access programs such as in health or education. Health programs in several countries give special attention to groups 
122 CHAPTER 4 TOWARD GREATER INCLUSION IN AFRICA   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 including children, adolescents, the elderly, or pregnant women. Uganda has committed to inclusive education and in 2006 passed the Persons with Disability Act, which requires institutions of higher learning to eliminate barriers to accessibility and prohibit discrimination (Emong and Eron 2016; Roberts Otyola and others 2017). Similarly, the government of Ghana has had specifc targets to educate learners with disabilities since 2013 (Ametepee and Anastasiou 2015). The government’s current Inclusive Education Policy establishes several measures, from adjusting educational infrastructure and teacher training in diversity and nondiscrimination to the tailoring of curricula to different educational needs. The policy is accompanied by a costed action plan to facilitate its implementation. 
Often, and especially when ethnicity or religion is divisive, governments may prefer 
to name the geographic region in which a certain group is concentrated. Programs can be geographically targeted to regions that may need special attention. Nigeria, for example, has between 250 and 400 different ethnic groups, depending on which criteria are applied. Following various political reforms to ensure the representation of ethnic and regional groups, in 1996 Nigeria established the Federal Character Commission (FCC) to oversee the implementation of affrmative action not only in government administration but also in social services, infrastructure development, and the private sector. The Federal Civil Service (FCS) instituted a geopolitical quota based on territorial states and zones but was silent on ethnicity and religion. Despite criticism of the quota system, the FCC seems to have made important contributions. It provides an avenue to resolve peacefully conficts over both ethnic and regional representation because disgruntled groups tend to approach the FCC or the FCC Committees of both Houses of the National Assembly to investigate claims and seek concrete data or remedies. The FCC also generates the data through which representation can be assessed and monitored. Finally, it has been argued that the FCC has moved the culture of bureaucratic recruitment toward greater diversity (Mustapha 2009). 
Legal Provisions and Reforms 
Although laws can be discriminatory, they also are one of the most potent agents 
of social change. African countries have wide-ranging legal and constitutional provisions aimed at social inclusion. For instance, over the past decade, Africa has seen a surge in reforms that promote gender equality, from laws that address workplace sexual harassment to laws that address domestic violence (box 4.5). In fact, Africa has been a global leader, having implemented the most reforms promoting gender equality of any region world-wide.Also notable are the countries that have explicitly acknowledged SOGI equality. In South Africa such equality was written into the Constitution. Mozambique and the Seychelles recently decriminalized same-sex relations (2015 and 2016, respectively). Other countries do not criminalize based on sexual orientation at all.

 Box 4.4 Legal Reform for Women in Africa 
Africa has implemented the most reforms promoting gender equality of any 
region globally, with 71 reforms over the last 10 years. Over 50 percent of these reforms changed laws that affected gender-based violence (GBV). Burundi, Comoros, Rwanda, São Tomé and Príncipe, and Zambia all introduced laws that addressed both workplace sexual harassment and domestic violence. Among the top reforming economies in the region over the past decade have been Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, Malawi, Mauritius, São Tomé and Príncipe, and Zambia (box fgure B4.4.1). 
Figure B4.4.1 Improvement in Women, Business and the Law Index, 2009– 
2018 
124 CHAPTER 4 TOWARD GREATER INCLUSION IN AFRICA   
 Democratic Republic of Congo saw the largest increase in its Women, Business 
and the Law index (from 42.5 in 2009 to 70.0 in 2018). Improvements in DRC 
were based on reforms allowing married women to register businesses, open bank accounts, sign contracts, get jobs, and choose where to live in the same way as men can. The legal requirement for wives to obey their husbands was removed, as were restrictions on women working in specifc industries such as mining, manufacturing, and construction. DRC also introduced gender nondiscrimination laws in employment and access to credit. 
Mauritius began reforms in 2008 by introducing civil remedies for sexual 
harassment at work, prohibiting the dismissal of pregnant workers, introducing 
paid paternity leave, and prohibiting discrimination in access to credit based on gender. In 2013 the government mandated equal remuneration for work of equal value and in 2015 increased the length of paid maternity leave from 12 to 14 weeks. Due to these reforms, Mauritius’ score increased by 16.88 points. Between 2009 and 2018, the female labor force participation rate rose by 6.82 percent relative to that of males. 
São Tomé and Príncipe introduced a domestic violence law in 2009; 
implemented a workplace sexual harassment law that included criminal penalties 
in 2012; and reformed its retirement laws for men and women to entitlement to full pension benefts, and equalized the mandatory retirement age for men and women in 2014. The country’s score increased by 58.75 percent. Between 2009 and 2018, the female labor force participation increased by 1.75 percent relative to that of males.

 ruled in 2017 that its Constitution requires the government to legally recognize 
transgender people’s gender self-identifcation. Namibia’s courts interpreted their 1963 law on registrations of births, marriages, and deaths as allowing offcial recognition of gender change. Other laws ban all or some forms of anti-LGBTI discrimination. Countries that ban some forms of this discrimination include Angola, Botswana, Cabo Verde, Mauritius, Mozambique, and the Seychelles; South Africa bans all forms. Another 10 African countries have supported LGBTI rights in declarations to the UN General Assembly or the UN Human Rights Council. These countries are Cabo Verde, Central African Republic, Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritius, Rwanda, São Tomé and Príncipe, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, and South Africa. Although different from decriminalization of same-sex relations, reforms to family laws across the world are also instructive. Hallward-Driemeier and Gajigo (2013) analyzed the effects of such changes for women in Ethiopia, where the change required both spouses’ consent in the administration of marital property. This reform removed the ability of one spouse to deny permission to the other to work outside the home. Simultaneously, a change raised the minimum age of women to marry, which strengthened women’s bargaining position within the household because older women usually have greater power. Where the reform has been enacted, women are also more likely to work outside the home, employ more educated workers, and work in paid and full-time jobs, after controlling for time and location effects. 
Law and custom are inextricably linked. Regarding land ownership, both formal and 
customary laws wield great infuence. Providing land titles or de facto recognition of land use patterns of historically excluded groups can be effective in increasing their inclusion and enhancing their dignity. Women in many societies, including in Africa, face multiple barriers to owning land. Making them joint holders in land redistribution or resettlement projects or reserving land use quotas can increase their access to opportunities, for example, in agricultural labor markets, while at the same time empowering them. Similarly, recognizing the customary rights of indigenous peoples over their native lands and strengthening their representation in land negotiations is as much about creating opportunity for these groups to use the land as it is about recognition (World Bank 2013, 216). For example, Mozambique’s 1997 land law allows oral evidence to be used in land tribunals. As literacy rates are low among poor and marginalized groups in rural areas, this measure proved critical to enabling their participation in land registration procedures (FAO 2010; cited in World Bank 2013). In Kenya, the decision of the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights to recognize the ownership rights of Endorois (agropastoralists) helped this group gain greater access to their ancestral lands around the Lake Bogoria Game Reserve, which the group traditionally used for cattle grazing and to perform their religious and cultural rites (Abraham 2012; cited in World Bank 2013, 217). Nevertheless, enforcement of laws can be challenging for several reasons, not least because enforcement

 agencies often refect exclusionary norms and attitudes. In South Sudan, despite 
the fact that the 2009 Land Act and the 2011 Transitional Constitution of South Sudan (TCSS) recognize women’s equal rights to land and property, perceptions that women cannot own land independently of husbands or male relatives remain widespread among land administrators in both statutory and customary systems (Marzatico 2014, 15). The disregard of customary land practices in the formalization of land rights can also exacerbate exclusion and become a source of confict. 
Rwanda’s far-reaching land reforms in the context of its national reconciliation 
had strong effects on women’s access to land markets and on their overall power. Legislative reform frst eliminated bias against female land ownership and was followed by the 2005 Organic Land Law (OLL), which established a single statutory system of land tenure and ended the dualism of customary and formal tenure systems. In 2010 Rwanda introduced a nationwide land tenure regularization (LTR) program, a frst-time land adjudication and registration process that was imagery-based and low cost. As a result of the reforms, women— with or without legal marriage certifcates—were more likely to be registered as owners alone or jointly with their spouses, and women’s rights to mortgage or lease land increased substantially. The LTR not only achieved impressive numbers of registrations in fewer than three years but also improved the perceptions of women’s land rights. The perceived rights for females to be registered as claimants (alone or jointly) on parcels owned by married couples increased from 33 percent to 67 percent–94 percent, depending on the program area (Ali and others 2011; Ali and others 2015). 
Social Programs 
Well-designed and implemented programs across the globe have changed the face of 
social exclusion. Of these, social safety nets (SSNs) have a historical track record of shielding households from the negative effects of shocks and, more recently, of building household and community assets. Such programs started in Africa in response to food crises and humanitarian emergencies and still complement emergency responses to crises or shocks, consequently reducing the cost and increasing the effectiveness of humanitarian action. Social safety nets often provide ready vehicles through which to intervene in crises. In response to the Ebola emergency, governments leveraged the existing modest programs and scaled up cash transfers and public works programs (Beegle and others 2018, 67). Over time, Africa has become a leader in the design and delivery of social safety nets. These programs run the entire gamut, from cash transfers of various hues to food transfers, school feeding programs, public works, social pensions, emergency response programs, and programs that build human capital (through health and education). Every country in the region has at least one SSN program. The average number of programs per country is 15. The numbers range from 2 in Republic of Congo and Gabon to 56 in Burkina Faso and 54 in 
INCLUSION MATTERS IN AFRICA 127    
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 Chad. African countries now spend on average 1.2 percent of their gross domestic 
product (GDP) on SSNs, close to the global average of 1.6 percent. Figure 4.1 shows the mix of safety net programs in Africa by region, income level, fragility, resource status, and drought exposure. The results are expected: low-income countries, those that are fragile, those exposed to drought, and those lacking in resources are more likely to have emergency programs with some cash transfers. Richer countries, on the other hand, tend to have food-based programs and social pensions. Public works are more common in countries that have low levels of drought exposure and those with better resource endowment, and in West African countries. 
A new generation of social safety net programs goes beyond poverty reduction 
to enhance the dignity of recipients. Among Africa’s many innovations, this new generation of social safety nets stands out. Their rapid and successful expansion is unique in the developing world. Beyond addressing income poverty and strengthening human capital, evidence is growing that social safety nets can promote social inclusion and the dignity of recipients. Orphans, other vulnerable children, and recipients with disabilities in Kenya, Mozambique, and Zambia reported that cash transfers raised their sense of self-confdence and dignity, gave them the ability to be more assertive, and enhanced their perception of future well-being (Attah and others 2016; Handa and others 2014a, 2014b; Haushofer and Shapiro 2013; Jones and others 2016; Seidenfeld, Handa, and Tembo 2013; all cited in Beegle and others 2018, 24). Although many of the same positive outcomes associated with social protection programs also obtain in other regions of the world, the scale of these programs in African countries and the vast proportions of the population that they reach makes their social inclusion related externalities particularly noteworthy. 
Since the social inclusion framework emphasizes not only ability and opportunity, 
but also the dignity of individuals and groups, it is opportune to ask: What are the channels through which SSNs enhance the dignity of individuals and groups? In Ghana, safety net programs have reduced the stigma of helplessness among persons with disabilities; in Lesotho and Zimbabwe, they have enabled children to go to school well dressed and clean; and, in Malawi, they have helped raise the social status of the poorest (Attah and others 2016; MacAuslan and Riemenschneider 2011; Oduro 2014; all cited in Beegle and others 2018, 163). Recipients of SSNs also are more able to meet their social obligations and engage in relationships that involve reciprocity, such as paying church tithes or funeral group fees, contributing to savings groups, or attending weddings (Pavanello and others 2016). Each of these elements raises the status of previously more dependent individuals and families, thus enhancing pride and dignity.

A broad array of programs that can be loosely classifed as “empowerment  
programs” often are targeted to historically excluded groups and can have large  
positive impacts. In Uganda, the Empowerment and Livelihood for Adolescents  
(ELA) program was developed and implemented by Building Resources Across  
Communities (BRAC) to provide training for small-scale enterprises and education  
for health and reduction of risky behaviors.  Tracking 4,888 girls over a period of  
two years, Bandiera and others (2013) found that (a) the program increased the  
likelihood of girls engaging in income-generating activities by 32 percent; (b) self-
reported condom use by those who were sexually active increased by 50 percent;  
(c) fertility rates dropped by 26 percent; and (d) there was a 76 percent reduction in adolescent girls reporting having had sex against their will during the past year. Importantly, the combined program (livelihood training plus health education) was more successful than most other interventions that focused exclusively on either life skills or livelihood skills. In Uganda, the World Bank supports the Nkingo girls’ clubs in Kemwenge and Kabarole. Run by BRAC, these clubs offer safe spaces and training in empowerment and life skills, as well as entrepreneurship and fnancial literacy training.  The girls’ clubs also offer access to sexual health, family planning, 
and legal aid. Evaluation of the Kenya Cash Transfer for Orphans and Vulnerable Children, a national unconditional cash transfer program, after four years of the program found a 5 percentage point reduction in the likelihood of pregnancy among females aged 12 to 24, but no reduction in early marriage.

  Box 4.5 In the Sahel: Focus on Young Women 
The Sahel has a tough terrain and faces multiple challenges, ranging from extreme poverty to conflict, desertification, and low institutional capacity. It also has a very young population. In Mauritania, 30 percent of the population is under 10 years, and over 44 percent is under 15 years. Young people have limited education and skills, and finding a job is difficult. In addition, the Sahel also has some of the world’s highest rates of child marriage, with adolescent girls being disproportionately affected. Early marriage thwarts their growth, development, agency, human capital accumulation, and overall life chances. Niger has the world’s highest prevalence of child marriage at 75 percent, followed by Chad, with the world’s third highest at 68 percent, and Mali at 55 percent, the world’s fifth highest. 
Initiated by the presidents of Burkina Faso, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, 
Mauritania, and Niger, the Sahel Women Empowerment and Demographic Dividend (SWEDD) is financed by the World Bank, with implementation supported by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). The project has used several innovations toward attaining its objective of empowering women and adolescent girls through access to quality reproductive, child, and maternal health services and helping boost the capacity of local partners. For instance, the project has garnered the support of religious leaders on child marriage, maternal and child health, family planning, girls’ education, gender-based violence (GBV), and elevating women’s agency. In yet another initiative, the project gives bicycles, school kits, and sanitary kits to girls, and grains and foodstuffs to their families. The project also organizes coaching classes in select subjects so that girls can keep up in school. Finally, the project trains young women in nontraditional trades and in some areas has given them tractors, which both augment their incomes and give them status and power in the community.

 posit that the impacts resulted from increased school enrollment and fnancial 
stability of the household as well as delayed age at frst sex (Handa and others 2015; cited in Chakravarty and others 2017). Box 4.6 casts a spotlight on the Sahel Women Empowerment and Demographic Dividend (SWEDD) project, which spans Burkina Faso, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger and focuses on the drivers of the exclusion of young women. 
Empowerment programs that combine multifaceted assistance have proven 
useful to survivors of physical and sexual violence. Because violence tends to be accompanied by psychological trauma, survivors often need a combination of medical treatment, health counseling, and psychosocial support in addition to legal or paralegal assistance. At the same time, economic empowerment for survivors often is a key factor in reducing their economic dependence on the perpetrators and improving resilience to violence. Experience from the World Bank’s engagement around GBV shows that collaboration among law enforcement, legal aid services, health care organizations, public health programs, educational institutions, and agencies devoted to social services and economic development has the deepest impacts. Appendix C presents examples of World Bank engagement with GBV in various African countries. 
Fostering normative and attitudinal change also has been at the heart of a range 
of national service programs that have been implemented in countries like Ghana, Kenya, and Nigeria. Some countries in Africa and globally have programs that require citizens, particularly young people, to undertake community service or live in a different part of the country for a time. The typical objective of such programs is to develop a sense of national identity and civic responsibility. Nigeria, for instance, has implemented such a program for over four decades, sending university graduates to different regions of the country for a mandatory one year of national service through the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC). Recent evidence suggests that this exposure to diverse groups within the country can foster a stronger sense of connection to the country as a whole. In Nigeria, participants in national service seem to develop greater national pride and more positive attitudes toward their country. Participants also are more likely to live outside their ethnic region seven years after the program. At the same time, such programs also may highlight distinctions among ethnic groups. The same Nigerian study suggests that participants in the NYSC are more positive toward their own ethnic group but not toward other ethnic groups following the program. The research also fnds that participants are more likely to have closest friends from their own ethnic group (Okunogbe 2018).

     Box 4.6 Reintegration for Ex-combatants in DRC and Liberia 
In 2008–09, a pilot project began in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in 
Kindu, Maniema, called Strengthening Socio-Economic Reintegration Opportunities for Vulnerable Households of Ex-combatants Demobilized through the PNDDR (National Program for Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration). This pilot provided (a) support for income-generating activities; (b) basic skills (literacy/numeracy) and household budget management training; (c) support to create or strengthen associations; and (d) information and 
sensitization around sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) and referral to SGBV services. Although the evaluation did not attribute causality, it suggested that, first, the project activities contributed to higher asset and household ownership and better nutritional outcomes. Second, the levels of confidence in other ex-combatants within the community, including male combatants, had increased by 44 percent since the beginning of the project in 2008. Third, the evaluation found that project beneficiaries were more informed about SGBV and related services than nonbeneficiary ex-combatants. 
In another intervention that targeted ex-combatants, the Liberian Ministry of 
Public Works, with support from UNMIL (United Nations Mission in Liberia), UNDP (United Nations Development Programme), and the World Bank, initiated a labor-intensive employment scheme to rehabilitate roads. This intervention offered some 8,000 jobs to ex-combatants and war-affected youth. Rates of both crime and domestic violence came down in areas in which these programs were implemented. Participants also reported that they have invested the income from these jobs in other revenue-generating activities.

Other Interventions That Promote Inclusion in Markets, Services, 
and Spaces 
As examples in previous sections show, technology is one of the most powerful 
means of deepening social inclusion. However, as examples in previous sections show, technology can exacerbate exclusion as well. Nevertheless, important instances of technology’s positive role deserve mention. Lack of access to credit affects some groups more that it does others, and innovations that provide access may have larger benefts for groups who start from a lower economic base. Although empirical evidence on the economic and social impacts of M-PESA—a money transfer system operated by Kenya’s largest cellular phone provider—and similar technologies is new and sparse, the indications are that it has positive effects for the poorest, and for women in particular. At the same time, however, 
132 CHAPTER 4 TOWARD GREATER INCLUSION IN AFRICA   
 
 its impact on individual savings may be limited (Van Hove and Dubus 2019). Suri 
and Jack (2014) fnd that the use of M-PESA can effectively improve the resilience of poor households to income shocks. In a 2016 paper, Suri and Jack argue that access to M-PESA in Kenya had reduced poverty, particularly for female-headed households. A recent evaluation of an experiment randomizing the promotion and registration of mobile savings accounts among women microentrepreneurs in Tanzania fnds that women saved substantially more through the mobile accounts and that additional business training bolsters this effect (Bastian and others 2018). 
Financial inclusion enabled by mobile savings accounts also opens new markets 
to women because women may be able to obtain more microloans through their mobile accounts, an additional service provided by the product. Although no signifcant evidence was found that these impacts translated to greater investment, sales, or profts, there was some evidence of business expanding through the 
Box 4.7 Building Infrastructure Does Not Ensure That It Will Be Used 
The existence of a separate toilet is not enough to ensure usage by women 
and girls. Privacy, cleanliness, safety, and availability of water matter. Women and girls with disabilities face additional challenges due to limitations in mobility. Even when water and sanitation facilities for females exist, they may not be accessible to females with disabilities, intensifying the context of their disadvantage. 
A survey of 62 primary schools in rural western Kenya found that 84 percent 
of them had separate latrines for girls, but 77 percent of these did not lock, and only 13 percent had water in or near the latrine. Furthermore, only 10 percent of schools reported always providing sanitary pads to girls. In most schools, disposal arrangements for used sanitary pads were not adequate (Alexander and others 2014). These findings underscore the importance of toilets as “package deals” to ensure usage, especially by female students and employees, and even for women in public places. 
The differential needs of women and girls become pronounced when they are 
menstruating. In Nigeria, approximately 25 percent of women seem to lack the requisite privacy for toileting needs. However, there is a high degree of variation. For example, 85 percent of women in Lagos reported having everything they need to manage their menstruation; only 37 percent in Kaduna State did. There also are differences across urban and rural areas. Approximately 88 percent of women in Nigeria have no handwashing facilities on their premises; 92 percent of rural women report the same (World Bank 2017c). Similar conditions obtain for women in many other countries across Africa and Asia.

 creation of proftable secondary businesses, as well as evidence of improvements in women’s empowerment and subjective well-being (Bastian and others 2018). Finally, as noted, the Internet has provided huge opportunities for the inclusion of previously excluded groups in markets, services, and spaces.Amplifying voice is one beneft. Innovative methods of using information and communication technology to solicit anonymous responses to questions have become increasingly popular. In Tanzania and South Sudan, two pilot initiatives referred to as “Listening to Africa” have been highly successful in collecting panel data via mobile phone interviews. Evaluations suggest that the method is cost effective, with low attrition rates even after more than 30 rounds of interviews (Croke and others 2012). 
The importance of interconnected services for all groups, especially those who 
are at risk, needs to be underscored. For instance, the provision of services often goes hand in hand with infrastructure. Yet, merely building infrastructure often has limited effectiveness for universal access. Box 4.7 draws out the importance of a bundle of interventions that need to accompany building toilets so that girls, women, and persons with disabilities can use them. Box 4.4 demonstrates the importance of interconnected interventions to enable ex-combatants to reintegrate in their communities. In each case, programs intended for previously excluded groups need careful ex ante analysis that shows why the groups were excluded and what can be done to rectify past wrongs. Ultimately, building systems to ensure that the right interventions are designed, implemented, and evaluated is critical to success. A useful example are the systems that provide identity documents to citizens and residents so that they can access services that are due them. As discussed, the lack of identity documentation is a key obstacle for many excluded groups. 
However, providing such documents often has signifcant administrative 
ramifcations and involves infrastructure and setting up delivery systems. One initiative to propel the inclusion of all in the identity systems of countries in Africa is the World Bank Group’s ID4D (Identifcation for Development) initiative. Under this initiative, to date, analyses have been conducted in 17 African countries: Botswana, Cameroon, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Morocco, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and Zambia. The objective has been to evaluate countries’ identity ecosystems and facilitate collaboration with governments for future work (World Bank 2017c). 
Indigenous knowledge systems and local languages and customs constitute the 
intellectual and cultural spaces of historically subordinated groups and are intrinsic to their dignity and pride. Their indigenous patrimonies also facilitate groups’ access to markets and services. One study in Lushoto District in northern Tanzania shows the importance of integrating the indigenous knowledge of

  weather forecasting with the Tanzania Meteorological Agency (Mahoo and 
others 2015). Language is a key marker of social identity, and those who speak minority languages often lag in schooling, jobs, and other endowments. Growing evidence suggests that the language of instruction (LOI) can help or hinder learning outcomes, especially of children who speak minority languages. For instance, Ethiopia’s comprehensive LOI policy mandated the use of the mother tongue as the language of instruction in grades one through eight. The policy also stipulated primary teacher training in the relevant language. Although all students learn Amharic as a national language, English may be introduced if desired by the state. Prior to 1994, all Ethiopian students were taught in Amharic. The policy seems to have been successful. 
One analysis found that children who were taught in their mother tongue for 
8 years of primary education outperformed those who received instruction in the mother tongue for only 5 years and in English in the upper primary grades (Heugh and others 2007; cited in Bashir and others 2018). Another study in Guinea-Bissau and Niger assessed transitional bilingual programs that were piloted in selected schools. This study found that students in Niger who started in their mother tongues were able to read and write better even in their second language. The strongest positive effects in both countries were for rural children and girls in the bilingual programs. The programs also garnered the support of parents (Hovens 2002). In general, making information accessible to those who communicate in languages and mediums that are distinct from those of the majority is an important step toward social inclusion. Accessibility to information also is a step toward increased accountability of the state and service providers. For persons with disabilities, as several programs the world over have shown, this service is indispensable to their ability to access information. 
In addition to knowledge systems and making information accessible, several 
initiatives also have focused on the quality and quantity of data for better analysis. Some of these initiatives focus on better data on poverty, human development, and other outcomes. Chapter 2 shows that the availability of data led to analyses that brought out the nuances of disadvantage based on disability status. All too often, such data disaggregated by social group are hard to come by, as are data on exclusionary processes. The World Bank’s Gender Innovation Lab
4 both collects granular data on cognitive skills, bias, 
discrimination, and other aspects; and evaluates the impact of experimental interventions.A range of other data platforms now follow open data principles and make data public. For example, as cited above, Croke and others (2012) show how high-frequency panels can be collected using mobile phone interviews. Finally, the role of geospatial data is important to understand the 
INCLUSION MATTERS IN AFRICA 135   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 intersection of social and spatial exclusion. Across Africa, initiatives to collect 
better data and make them accessible have proliferated, as more and more analysts and activists realize the importance of data. However, we emphasize that data are merely the raw material for insight. Governments and international organizations also need to invest in better and more rigorous analysis of social inclusion. 
Historical wrongs often are the foundations of present-day exclusions. These 
wrongs can be corrected by several means, one of which is symbolic acts. Truth and reconciliation commissions are an increasingly common mechanism employed globally, including in Africa, to overcome past conficts and divisions. In South Africa, the post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)
5 
instituted during the transition to democracy was intended help overcome the legacy of apartheid and racial divisions. Rwanda established its National Unity and Reconciliation Commission (NURC)
6 in 1999. In Mauritius, the Truth and 
Justice Commission was established in 2009 to address the legacy of slavery and to investigate the dispossession of land. In the Gambia, the Truth, Reconciliation and Reparations Commission (TRRC) was sworn in in October 2018. However, reconciliatory processes are complex, and their implementation is politically sensitive. What constitutes “truth” and “reconciliation” in the wake of confict is likely contested by different groups, and openly addressing historic wrongs can trigger renewed tensions and may be traumatic for survivors of violence (Broneus 2010). There also are no clear international norms for the powers or standards of proceedings for such commissions (OHCHR 2006). Other symbolic acts include renaming streets and monuments, and in the process acknowledging the historical wrongs and elevating the identities of those who have been wronged. 
Concluding Refections 
Chapter 4, and indeed the entire report, highlights the role of diverse actors in the progress toward social inclusion. The state, of course, is the preeminent among these, but there are other important drivers of change. Non-state actors, citizens, and communities who exercise agency to effect change are powerful vehicles for social inclusion. As is well-known across the world, programs and projects that are anchored in, and derive leadership from, the community are more likely to succeed. Moreover, when the state and service providers are moored by systems that make them accountable to citizens and communities, these providers garner both community ownership and greater likelihood of success. Technology, for instance, is one of the most powerful means of deepening social inclusion and enhancing accountability to communities and citizens. However, governments and other actors also must realize the risks that technology can pose for those who do not have access to this potent medium. Finally, programs that acknowledge that

 some communities and groups may feel left out by the state and their elites, and 
make genuine efforts to correct the perception, can both change outcomes toward social inclusion and rebalance power relations. 
Chapter 3 discusses that belief systems, superstitions, stigmas, and other practices 
present daunting barriers to the inclusion of certain groups. Chapter 4 highlights several initiatives that effected change in such processes and practices. For example, the stigma of HIV is still strong in many parts of the world. Similarly, FGM, which holds importance for some groups, also violates the very personhood of women and girls and makes them less likely to achieve their potential. For policies and programs, such beliefs and practices matter. They stymie the abilities, opportunities, and dignity of certain groups, and are costly across society. These beliefs and practices also can permeate and infuence the ways in which the state and service providers interact with historically excluded groups. Nevertheless, it is important to note that such beliefs, norms and practices, often considered to be insurmountable barriers to achieving inclusion, are known to change. 
In sum, Chapter 4 draws attention to the myriad reforms, policies, programs, and 
projects that advance social inclusion and emphasizes the importance of design and implementation of such interventions. An illustrative list of interventions is summarized in table 4.1.Table 4.1 outlines the domains in which change is intended and examples of actions taken by various countries toward social inclusion. Finally, investing in social inclusion often comes with fnancial, administrative, and political costs. The benefts often outweigh the costs, depending on the context. Therefore, to secure a win-win outcome, the state and society need a clear social contract and a transparent enactment and implementation of legal and administrative steps toward social inclusion.

144 CHAPTER 4 TOWARD GREATER INCLUSION IN AFRICA CHAPTER5   Final Refections 
Main Messages 
1. Africa has seen signifcant progress towards social inclusion 
in the past few decades, in many areas moving at a pace faster than seen globally. 
2. Some groups and areas have been left out of the progress in Africa and continue to remain at risk. Social inclusion helps us understand who is left out, from what, in what ways, and why. 
3. Social inclusion draws attention to the drivers of poverty in Africa and explains that while we need to focus on poverty, this is only a starting point to end the exclusion. 
4. Structures and processes that aid and abet social exclusion often have historical and cultural roots. 
5. Areas that are affected by confict and fragility stand out as having the poorest outcomes related to social inclusion. Conversely, peace and security matter for social inclusion. 
6. Societies incur signifcant costs from social exclusion. Yet, achieving social inclusion also has costs. Therefore, investing in social inclusion has to be a conscious choice for states and societies. 
7. With a strong social contract, social inclusion in Africa is 
eminently within reach, as hundreds of initiatives across the continent demonstrate.

 This report identifes barriers to social inclusion and presents pathways to inclusion 
across countries in Africa. It defnes social inclusion as the process of improving the terms for individuals and groups to take part in society. It asserts that inclusion in markets, services, and spaces is the foundation for shared prosperity (World Bank 2013). The report highlights that impacts on poverty and human capital defcits can be achieved only when we identify who is likely to stay poor, how, and why. It focuses on social structures and processes, an understanding of which helps get to the core of how exclusion plays out. Without this understanding, many of the solutions we employ to address social inclusion are likely to fail or to meet with resistance. 
The Africa Region of the World Bank has developed its new Regional strategy. This 
report contributes to the priority areas of the strategy by using the social inclusion lens to focus on, among others, women’s empowerment, digital technology, fragility, and climate change. The report also shows that Africa is not alone in some of the challenges of social exclusion. These issues affect all countries and regions—OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) and non-OECD. There are areas in which some of the fastest progress globally has been in African countries. Examples include reforms of laws that enable women’s participation in markets, that enhance women’s safety and security, and laws that end the discrimination against individuals in same-sex relationships. The report also describes instances in which norms and practices that often are implicated in governmental resistance to change have been transformed. Movement toward the abolition of female genital mutilation (FGM) in Burkina Faso, and the growing de-stigmatization of persons with HIV or with disabilities are three illustrations of this transformation. Finally, Africa is home to some of the most powerful innovations toward social inclusion. M-PESA, a money transfer system operated by a cell phone provider in Kenya, and a new generation of social safety net programs stand out.

148 CHAPTER 5 FINAL REFLECTIONS     
 
 To summarize, this report accomplishes the following: 
• It places social inclusion front and center in an analysis of Africa’s achievements 
and the challenges the region faces in poverty reduction and human capital 
formation. 
• The report takes an interdisciplinary approach, using evidence from varied sources and bringing empirical weight to issues that often are debated through advocacy and contestation. 
• It addresses with granularity of who is left out, from what, and how. The report 
garners and integrates evidence on historically invisible groups such as persons with disabilities, persons with albinism, some women, refugees, migrants, LGBTI persons, certain ethnic and occupational groups, persons who live in “lagging areas,” and especially young people. It further focuses on the intersectionality of social identity. 
• The report is grounded in the experience of African countries but also shows that Africa’s social inclusion challenges are neither unique nor exceptional. 
• It shows the channels through which individuals and economies may incur costs 
of social exclusion. These costs may be direct or indirect, short or long term. Cumulatively, the costs can impede the best efforts of governments and societies. 
• It provides examples of the remarkable innovations that abound in Africa and of the policy and programmatic movement toward social inclusion. The report shines a light on African examples in which deeply entrenched social and cultural norms and practices have been changed. 
• Finally, the report asserts that social inclusion must be a conscious choice for societies and their governments. Inclusion must be based on a clear social contract that recognizes both the costs and benefts of policies and interventions to move toward it.

 Appendix A 
Engaging around Social Inclusion with World Bank Partners in Africa 
The World Bank has an ongoing dialogue about social inclusion with diverse 
counterparts across Africa. Governments have been particularly interested in integrating social inclusion in the design of policies and in indicators and methods that assess social inclusion impacts of policies. Perhaps the largest set of consultations took place around the Environmental and Social Framework (ESF), from general discussions on nondiscrimination to those that addressed specifc identity groups. Other conversations took place on policy issues that included provision of water and sanitation, services for persons with disabilities, albinism, trends in internal displacement, women’s participation in the labor market, gender-based violence, and the reintegration of ex-combatants. Examples follow. 
In 2014, the World Bank organized a week-long workshop for 44 representatives from 
government agencies, Parliaments, civil society, and academics at Lake Victoria in Uganda This workshop had been requested following previous trainings on country social analysis (CSA) and poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA) during which social inclusion was explicitly addressed. 
On End Poverty Day (EPD) in October 2017, the World Bank’s Africa Region brought 
together civil society organizations (CSOs), academics, government offcials, media, and World Bank staff from country offces across the Region for a day of discussions through an interactive video conference on mobility and social inclusion. 
Water and Social Inclusion was the theme of a December 2017 discussion and training 
session convened remotely for 36 participants from client governments and water and sanitation service providers in Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The session was held by videoconference following a request from the World Bank’s partner governments for practical training on integrating social inclusion and gender into “water writ large.” 
Finally, World Bank teams have strong partnerships with civil society, academia, 
and regional entities such as the African Union (AU) and the African Development Bank (AfDB), as well as with bilateral donors and other grant-making organizations. Especially following enunciation of the Leave No One Behind agenda, most of these partners have exhorted the World Bank to engage more intensively on social inclusion.

  Appendix B 
Social Inclusion in the World Bank’s Environmental and Social Framework 
Social inclusion has a place of pride in the new World Bank Environmental and 
Social Framework (ESF), which has applied to World Bank Group (WBG) projects since October 2018. At the start, much was said about the step forward that the ESF represented, including specifc attention to a broad range of issues including labor, stakeholder engagement, and social inclusion. Regarding social inclusion, Environmental and Social Standards (ESS) require borrowers to pay explicit attention to both the identifcation of disadvantaged or vulnerable groups and the mitigation of risks and impacts to them in relation to a range of project risks and impacts and stakeholder engagement. The ESF also places obligations on World Bank staff that are detailed in the Bank Directive, “Addressing Risks and Impacts on Disadvantaged or Vulnerable Individuals or Groups.” The Bank Directive requires World Bank staff to take specifc steps regarding the review of the environmental and social assessment conducted by the borrower; to participate in consultation activities, as appropriate; and to review the borrower’s information (or information the World Bank itself has gathered) on risks and impacts to these populations. 
This explicit and across-the-board articulation of, and attention to, vulnerability— 
with responsibilities placed on both the borrower and the World Bank—integrates social inclusion more tightly into the design and implementation of investment project fnancing. In addition, the ESF implementation presents an opportunity for the World Bank and its borrowers to build on, and deepen, past work on social inclusion. The Bank Directive necessitates the expansion of a knowledge base, both internally and among World Bank clients, on characteristics of the disadvantaged and excluded, on the factors that contribute to exclusion within certain project contexts, and, importantly, on how social inclusion can be operationalized. Ultimately, the ESF will expand the space available for developing knowledge on how social inclusion can be advanced through WBG-fnanced projects.

 Appendix C 
Addressing Gender-Based Violence in Africa: Snapshot of World Bank Engagement 
Interventions that support behavioral and normative change often are crucial to sustain 
the impacts of social inclusion policies and programs. For gender-based violence (GBV), for instance, severely unequal power relations between men and women, refected in attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that exclude women, often are deeply entrenched. Addressing these ingrained causes of GBV requires long-term engagement and an explicit focus on changing gender norms. Comparing different forms of prevention and awareness-raising activities, global evidence shows that the most promising results come from integrated approaches that include community outreach and participatory workshops and promote refection and debate—including with boys and men. 
The World Bank supports programs to counter GBV through fnancing, technical 
assistance, and research. The following illustrative projects provide fnancing to address GBV. 
• Regional—Great Lakes Emergency Sexual and Gender-Based Violence and Women’s 
Health Project in Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Rwanda and at the International Conference of the Great Lakes Region. 
• Democratic Republic of Congo—Prevention and mitigation of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) in North and South Kivu Project. Focused on testing innovative pilots that support prevention and delivery of holistic services to women, children, and men survivors of SGBV. 
• Democratic Republic of Congo—Gender-Based Violence Prevention and Response Project. Focused on the prevention of and response to GBV in 38 health zones in North Kivu, South Kivu, Maniema, and Tanganyika provinces. 
• Somalia—Somalia Inclusive Community Resilience and GBV pilot-tested economic empowerment initiatives paired with GBV prevention and response services. 
• Uganda—Strengthening Social Risk Management and Gender-Based Violence Prevention and Response Project, a multisectoral intervention. 
• Gender-based violence interventions linked to forced displacement—Under the Development Response to Displacement Impacts Project (covering Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda), implementation of interventions and subprojects under the three investment components: basic social services and economic infrastructure, environmental and natural resources management, and traditional and nontraditional livelihoods. The interventions and subprojects will be gender-informed and contribute to GBV prevention and response among target benefciaries of the project. Operational guidance is being developed for Kenya that will be extended to the other countries.
