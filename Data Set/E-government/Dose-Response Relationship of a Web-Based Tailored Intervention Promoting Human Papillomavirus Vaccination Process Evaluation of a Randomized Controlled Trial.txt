Abstr act
Backgr ound: In the Netherlands, human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination uptak e remains low. To impro ve informed decision
making (IDM) and HPV vaccination acceptability , we systematically developed an interacti ve, web-based tailored interv ention
to which mothers of Dutch girls were invited to participate.
Objecti ve: The aim of this study was to provide insight into the interv ention’ s working mechanisms by evaluating (1) program
use, (2) program acceptability , and (3) the relationship of program use with program acceptability and interv ention effects (ie,
dose-response relationship).
Methods: Only mothers from the interv ention arm of a randomized controlled trial that assessed the effectiveness of the
web-based, tailored interv ention were included in this study . They were invited to visit the website of the web-based interv ention
between baseline (January 2015, just before access to the interv ention) and follow up (March 2015, prior to the first HPV
vaccination). Indicators for program use were time of website use (ie, duration of interv ention exposure) and completeness (ie,
proportion of all available web pages visited). HPV vaccination uptak e registered by Praeventis was used as the primary outcome.
Secondary outcomes were IDM, decisional conflict, and social-psychological determinants of HPV vaccination uptak e.
Results: Among the 3995 invited mothers, 2509 (62.80%) logged on to the website, 2239 of whom (89.24%) visited at least
one page of the interv ention components. On average, mothers spent 21.39 minutes (SD 12.41) on the website and completed
50.04% (SD 26.18%) of the website components. Participants rated the website 7.64 (SD 1.39) on a 10-point scale. Program
acceptability was signif icantly associated with completeness (β=4.36, P<.001), but not with time of website use (β=–.07, P=.77).
Intention-to-treat analysis (N=3995) showed a signif icant positi ve effect of completeness on all outcome measures (all P<.003;
Bonferroni-corrected α=.05/15 factors), including on HPV vaccination uptak e. Time of website use had a signif icant positi ve
effect on all outcomes (all P<.003), except for uptak e (P=.20), risk perception when not vaccinated (P=.14), subjecti ve norms
(P=.03), and habit (P=.01).
Conclusions: Program use and acceptability of the interv ention were adequate. Completeness was positi vely associated with
acceptability . Furthermore, positi ve effects (ie, dose-response effects) were found for completeness and time of website use on
the mothers’ IDM, decisional conflict, and almost all of the social-psychological determinants of HPV vaccination acceptability .
In addition, the extent to which mothers completed the interv ention had a positi ve impact on their daughters’ vaccination uptak e.
This indicates that the web-based, tailored interv ention fits well with the mothers’ needs, and that completeness of use is essential
for impro ving HPV vaccination uptak e, acceptability , and IDM. Program use should therefore be promoted.

Introduction
Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among
women worldwide. Globally , in 2018, there were 569,847 new
cases and 311,365 deaths caused by cervical cancer [1].
Persistent infection by human papilloma virus (HPV) appears
to be the major cause of cervical cancer; nearly all cases (over
99%) are attrib utable to an HPV infection [2,3]. There is also
an increasing body of evidence that strongly links HPV infection
with cancers of the anus, vulva, vagina, penis, and head and
neck (eg, [4,5]). In the Netherlands, on an annual basis since
2010, girls are invited by the Dutch National Immunization
Program to recei ve the vaccine against HPV upon reaching 13
years of age. However, HPV vaccination uptak e remains low
(45.5% in 2017) [6]. The uptak e needs to be higher to reduce
the incidence of cervical cancer in women. Therefore, we
developed an interacti ve, web-based, tailored interv ention
promoting HPV vaccination acceptability among Dutch mothers
of invited girls for HPV vaccination [7]. Further , to impro ve
vaccine acceptability , important interv ention objecti ves were
to impro ve informed decision making (IDM) and to decrease
decisional conflict [7].
To date, only four studies have examined the effectiveness of
tailored interv entions in promoting HPV vaccination acceptance
[8-11]; three of these studies showed positi ve effects [9-11]. To
our knowledge, the only tailored interv ention that was
web-based turned out to be ineffective [8]. The advantage of
web-based interv entions is that they have the potential to enable
large-scale application at relati vely low cost [12] and therefore
can have a substantial impact at the population level [13].
Furthermore, only two of the existing studies using tailored
interv entions to promote HPV vaccination acceptance
incorporated a process evaluation [9,11]. Process evaluation
provides insight into the extent to which an interv ention was
used, which is relevant for determining factors that influence
the effectiveness of an interv ention [14-16]. Specif ically , this
analysis can provide insight into whether an interv ention is
ineffective due to implementation failure or to the inferior
quality of the interv ention method(s), thereby avoiding the
so-called type III error [17]. It also provides recommendations
for interv ention impro vement.
For the use of online interv entions, three aspects are relevant:
a first visit, staying, and revisiting [18,19]. In the conte xt of
decision making about HPV vaccination, we consider a first
visit and staying as the most relevant aspects. Revisiting seems
less relevant, since getting the HPV vaccine is hardly a repetiti ve
behavior (ie, it consists of two injections). Within the electronic
health (eHealth) arena, limited interv ention use in terms of a
first visit and staying is a broadly recognized problem [20]. The
extent to which one uses an interv ention may positi vely impact
the interv ention effects (ie, the so-called “dose-responserelation”). Positi ve dose-response relationships have been found
for eHealth interv entions (eg, [21-23]). In the conte xt of
promoting HPV vaccination acceptability , none of the studies
that incorporated a process evaluation addressed the
dose-response relationship (for a review, see [24]). Moreo ver,
data on the use of web-based interv entions have been poorly
reported [20,25] or not reported at all [26].
Furthermore, assessing program acceptability may shed light
on the causes of nonuse or incomplete use [27]. An interv ention
needs to be considered appropriate by the target group and to
suit their needs in order to reach the intended outcomes [28].
Acceptability will impro ve interaction and the users’ feelings
of engagement, and, as a consequence, the likelihood of
health-related behavior changes [29].
Results from the effect evaluation showed positi ve interv ention
effects on IDM, decisional conflict, and nearly all determinants
of HPV vaccination uptak e (for more details on the results of
the effect evaluation, see [30]). This paper describes the process
evaluation of the web-based tailored interv ention promoting
HPV vaccination acceptance [7]. The aim of this process
evaluation was to provide insights into the interv ention’ s
working mechanisms by evaluating (1) program use, (2) program
acceptability , and (3) the relationship of program use with
program acceptability and interv ention effects (ie, dose-response
relationships).
Methods
Participants and Study Design
The study was appro ved by the Ethical Committee of the VU
Medical Center in Amsterdam (Netherlands Trial Register:
NTR4795). This process evaluation was part of a randomized
controlled trial on the effectiveness of the interv ention [30]. For
the purpose of this study , only participants from the
experimental condition (ie, those invited to use the web-based
interv ention; N=3995) were included in the analyses. Details
of the trial design, such as power calculations, participant
eligibility , and recruitment procedures, have been published
elsewhere [30]. This study was conducted between January
2015 (baseline, just before access to the interv ention) and March
2015 (follo w up, prior to the first HPV vaccination), in line with
the national HPV vaccination round of 2015. Mothers were
invited to use the web-based interv ention between baseline and
follow up (mid-January 2015).
Inter vention Components
We developed the web-based tailored interv ention with virtual
assistants using the 6-step Interv ention Mapping protocol for
developing theory- and evidence-based health promotion
interv entions [31]. In short, the web-based interv ention provided
mothers with tailored feedback about topics on HPV vaccination,
delivered by two virtual assistants. Multimedia Appendix 1

RenderXpresents a selection of screenshots of the website. The website
consisted of 4 menu options: (1) 2-sided, tailored information
about HPV vaccination, (2) a decisional balance in which
mothers could weigh their percei ved pros and cons, (3) practical
information, and (4) frequently asked questions. Within menus
1-3, mothers could visit several components. In addition,mothers were given the opportunity to visit an “in-depth”
information page within some of the components (eg,
educational movies). Table 1provides a brief overvie w of the
interv ention components. More detailed descriptions of the
interv ention, including its theoretical basis, are published
elsewhere [7].

Description Menu and component
Information about HPVavaccination
Mothers are provided with general information about HPV, cervical cancer , and HPV vaccination. General information
Mothers are challenged to consider whether the age of their daughter is appropriate to get vaccinated
against HPV. The relationship between sexual activity in relation to the HPV vaccine is also dis-
cussed.Importance of vaccinating at a young age
Mothers are asked to estimate both the risk of their daughter getting infected with HPV and the risk
of their daughter developing cervical cancer later in life, and are then provided with tailored feedback
accordingly .HPV -related risks
Mothers are asked to rate the effectiveness of alternati ve methods for protecting against cervical
cancer and are then provided with tailored feedback according to their answers.Methods to protect against cervical cancer
Mothers are provided with an explanation of how infection with HPV can lead to cervical cancer
(eg, by viewing an educational video).From HPV to cervical cancer
Mothers are provided with several statements regarding HPV, cervical cancer , and HPV vaccination,
and are asked to indicate whether these are true (a fact) or false (a story). They then recei ve tailored
feedback accordingly .Facts and stories
Mothers are presented with a variety of potential side effects of the HPV vaccine and are asked to
indicate whether or not they are scientif ically proven. They are then provided with tailored feedback,
stating the correct responses.Side effects
Mothers are asked about the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine in protecting both against their
daughter getting infected with HPV and developing cervical cancer . They are then provided with
tailored feedback about the effectiveness of HPV vaccination.Effectiveness
Mothers are asked to indicate what they think most mothers in their direct environment will decide
regarding their daughters’ HPV vaccination. They are then provided with tailored feedback and are
shown the actual HPV vaccination uptak e in different regions of the Netherlands in 2014.Other mothers
Mothers are explained in a generic way how the HPV vaccine works in protecting against HPV and
cervical cancer with an educational video.Vaccine working mechanisms
Weighing the pros and cons
Mothers are presented with a list of pros and cons of HPV vaccination. Based on pros and cons
mothers mark ed as most salient, a decisional balance reveals their current position on a scale ranging
between wanting and not wanting to get their daughter vaccinated.Decisional balance
Mothers are invited to list their central values for life and link these to HPV vaccination. Value clarif ication
Practical information provides mothers with information such as how and where to recei ve the HPV
vaccine and provides them with advice on how they discuss HPV vaccination with personal important
others (eg, their daughter and partner).Practical information
Frequently asked questions
Frequently asked questions provides answers to known questions about the HPV vaccine (eg, “does
my daughter know if she’s infected with HPV?”) or getting the HPV vaccine (eg, “where do I get
the HPV vaccine?”).About HPV vaccination
Mothers are provided with possible solutions to problems with the website such as not being able
to hear or see the virtual assistants.Problems with the website

Measur ements
All data were derived from web-based self-report questionnaires
and computer logs.Program Use
Program use was measured according to time of website use
and completeness. Both factors were constructed based on
computer logs that registered the pages and components the

RenderXmothers had visited and the amount of time they spent on the
website during their visit(s).
Time of website use represents the total amount of time spent
on the website. Each time mothers logged on to the website, a
record was created, in which both the date and time of the first
and last page the mothers entered were registered. Time per
session was calculated by subtracting the time of the last entered
page from the time of the earliest entered page. The total time
of website use was then calculated by adding up the amount of
time spent in each session.
Completeness represents the proportion of all available web
pages visited by the mother while she was logged on to the
website, ranging from 0% (visited no pages) to 100% (visited
all pages).Program Acceptability
Program acceptability was assessed at the 6-week follow up by
asking mothers to rate the interv ention and the virtual assistants
on a 10-point scale, ranging from 0 (very bad) to 10 (excellent).
The grade for the website was used as an indicator for overall
program acceptability to examine the association with program
use. In addition, mothers evaluated the information provided
by the website (eg, credibility , relevance), percei ved user control
(eg, percei ved degree of autonomy), and how they percei ved
the virtual assistants (eg, reliability) (See Table 2and Table 3
for an overvie w). These acceptability measures were assessed
on a 7-point scale, and some were averaged into one scale. All
composite scores showed sufficient internal consistenc y
(Cronbach α ≥.71 for scales with >2 items; Pearson r≥0.84 for
scales with 2 items).

Outcomes
Primary Outcome: HPV Vaccination Uptak e
An objecti ve measure for HPV vaccination uptak e was derived
from Praeventis, which is the national electronic vaccination
register that monitors the vaccination status for all children up
to 18 years of age living in the Netherlands [44]. Uptak e was
dichotomized into having recei ved no HPV injection (0=not
vaccinated) and having recei ved 1 or 2 HPV injections
(1=vaccinated), as data analyses showed that determinants of
HPV vaccination uptak e contrasted the most between these
groups.
Secondary Outcomes: IDM, Decisional Conflict, and
Social-Psyc hological Determinants of HPV Vaccination
Uptak e
Multimedia Appendix 2provides the measurement details of
the constructs IDM, decisional conflict, and the
social-psychological determinants of HPV vaccination uptak e
[30,45-54]. Determinants accounted for were intention, attitude,
risk perception of having recei ved the HPV vaccine, risk
perception without having received the HPV vaccine, anticipated
regret about rejecting the HPV vaccine, beliefs, subjecti ve
norms, habit strength toward HPV vaccination, self-ef ficacy,
knowledge, and percei ved relati ve effectiveness of HPV
vaccination compared to alternati ve methods.
Sociodemographics
Sociodemographics were included as background variables (ie,
age, educational level, country of birth, and religion).
Level of education referred to the mothers’ highest completed
level of education. It was classif ied as low (less than secondary
or vocational education), intermediate (secondary through
preuni versity education), or high (professional or university
education) [30,49,50].
Country of birth was dichotomized into “Netherlands” vs
“other ,” because the percentage of mothers born in the latter
category (276/3995, 6.91%) was too small for further
subdi vision in our sample.
Religion was measured by asking mothers about their religious
convictions (Protestant, Roman Catholic, Muslim, Jewish,Buddhist, Hindu, other , or no religion). This was dichotomized
into “Protestant” vs “not Protestant” as earlier research and data
analyses showed that Protestants more frequently refrain from
vaccination compared to other religious groups [30,49,50].
Statistical Analyses
The sample and interv ention use data are summarized using
descripti ve statistics. For determining the dose-response relation,
intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses were used, which increases
power, while decreasing the risk of possible bias caused by
selecti ve dropout [55]. Missing data were imputed for uptak e,
determinants, and sociodemographics (not for use): we applied
multiple imputation by chained equations [55,56]. In total, 15
imputed datasets were generated using the predicti ve mean
matching algorithm in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences
(SPSS, IBM Corp). Results from these datasets were pooled
together using Rubin’ s rules [57]. Iteration plots were inspected
to check convergence of the imputations.
The relationship between acceptability and use was examined
using univariate regression analyses. The dose-response relation
between program use and interv ention effects was examined
by logistic and linear regression analyses (for dichotomous and
continuous variables, respecti vely) using the outcome score at
follow up as the dependent variable and the outcome scores at
baseline and program use (both completeness and time of
website use) as the independent variables [58]. Effects were
considered signif icant when the P value was lower than .003
(Bonferroni-corrected α=.05/15 factors). For the logistic
regressions, the odds ratio (OR) was used as an index of effect
sizes. These were interpreted as small (OR=1.5), medium
(OR=3.5), or large (OR=9.0) [59]. For the linear regressions,
effect sizes were calculated in R softw are (R Development Core
Team, Vienna, Austria) using Cohen ƒ2statistic, (R2AB–
R2A)/(1 – R2AB), in which Bis the variable of interest (ie, use),
Ais the set of all other variables (ie, the outcome at baseline),
R2ABis the proportion of variance accounting for Aand B
together , and R2Ais the proportion of variance accounted for
by A[60]. These were classif ied as small (ƒ2=0.02), medium
(ƒ2=0.15), and large (ƒ2=0.35) [59]. We performed complete
case analyses as a sensiti vity check for substantial differences
with the results from ITT.

Response Rates and Attrition
A flow diagram of the recruitment and response of participants
in the experimental condition, as part of the process evaluation,
is shown in Figure 1. From the 4555 participants who were
randomized into the experimental condition at baseline (T0),
4277 (93.90%) completed the baseline questionnaire, 2511
(55.13%) visited the interv ention, and 2197 (48.23%) completedthe follow-up questionnaire 8 weeks later (T1). Dropout analysis
showed that there was signif icantly more dropout with regard
to participants not born in the Netherlands, those with a lower
educational level, those having a daughter not being vaccinated,
and those with low levels of risk perception. In total, 564
participants were excluded as they (a) did not meet the inclusion
criteria (ie, being a mother of a daughter born in 2002 and aged
24-62 years), (b) were found to be duplicates, or (c) encountered
a language barrier . The final sample for ITT analysis consisted
of 3995 mothers.

on multiple criteria (eg, male with an invalid age). Therefore, the total number of participants excluded differed from the sum of separate criteria for
exclusion.
Sample Description
Table 4shows the sample description of participants in the
experimental condition. No data were available on
sociodemographics of the population from which the sample
was derived (ie, Dutch mothers of 12-year -old girls); hence, we
were unable to assess whether the study sample wasrepresentati ve. The mothers’ mean age was 43.70 years (range
27.00-62.00 years). On average, mothers had a positi ve intention
toward their daughters’ HPV vaccination at baseline (mean
score 5.35, SD 1.69). Compared with the national HPV
vaccination uptak e at the time (ie, 2015), uptak e was higher in
the study sample (59,866/93,173; 60.98% vs 2923/3995;
73.17%) [61].

Program Use
From the 3995 mothers in the interv ention group, a total of 2509
mothers (62.80%) logged in (ie, time of website use >0). Of
these, 73.06% (1833/2509) logged in once, 19.89% (499/2509)
logged in twice, 5.00% (125/2509) logged in three times, and
2.07% (52/2509) logged in four times or more. On average,
mothers spent 21.39 minutes (SD 12.41) on the website.
Of the 2509 mothers that had initially logged in, 2239 (89.24%)
visited at least one page of a component of the interv ention (ie,
completeness >0). Only these 2239 mothers were included for
describing use of specif ic interv ention components and program
acceptability (see below). On average, the mothers completed
50.04% (SD 26.18%) of the website components (ie, 51/101
pages).Use of Inter vention Components
Table 5shows the breakdo wn for the use of interv ention

links to recei ve in-depth information, it was mark ed as “visited. ”
Mothers visited the page “Ways to Protect Against Cervical
Cancer” the most frequently (1971/2239, 88.03%), followed by
“Chance” (1945/2239, 86.87%), whereas they visited “Value
Clarif ication” the least (293/2239, 12.53%). “General
Information” had the highest completion rate (1622/2239,
72.44%), whereas “Side Effects” and “Effectivity” were
completed the least (both 19/2239, 0.85%). Only a small
percentage of the mothers (4.20%-13.22%; n=94-298) visited

Dose-Response Relation Between Program Use and
Inter vention Outcomes
Table 7provides an overvie w of the effects of program use
(completeness and time of website use) on the primary and
secondary outcomes according to the ITT analyses. Signif icant
positi ve effects were found for completeness on all outcome
measures (all P<.003). The more mothers had completed the
interv ention, the more likely they were to have their daughter
vaccinated against HPV and make an informed decision, and
were less likely to experience decisional conflict at follow up.
In addition, positi ve effects of completeness were found with
respect to all social-psychological determinants of HPV
vaccination acceptability (eg, HPV vaccination intention, beliefs;
see Table 7).Time of website use had a positi ve effect on all outcomes (all
P<.003), except for HPV vaccination uptak e, risk perception
when not vaccinated, subjecti ve norms, and habit (Table 7).
The more time mothers spent on the interv ention, the more
likely they were to make an informed decision, experience less
decisional conflict, have a higher intention to vaccinate their
daughter , have a more positi ve attitude, have more positi ve
beliefs, have a lower risk perception of HPV vaccination,
anticipate more feelings of regret about rejecting the HPV
vaccine, report a higher relati ve effectiveness of the HPV
vaccine, have higher self-ef ficacy expectations, and have more
knowledge at follow up.
Effect sizes were small overall (see Table 7). Results from the
complete case analyses were similar for both completeness and
time of website use, except for a lack of effect of time of website
use on intention.

Discussion
Principal Findings
The aim of this process evaluation was to examine (1) program
use, (2) program acceptability , and (3) the relationship between
program use and acceptability and interv ention outcomes for
the web-based tailored interv ention about HPV vaccination.Program Use
Almost two thirds (62.80%) of the mothers who were invited
to visit the interv ention logged in to the interv ention. This reach
is adequate, and is comparable to that reported for other eHealth
interv entions (eg, [62]). However, it still leaves room for
impro vement to increase the reach by emplo ying strate gies such
as arousing interest in this eHealth interv ention. Support for
this notion comes from Crutzen et al [63], who showed that
arousing interest successfully increased the intention to visit a

RenderXwebsite about hepatitis A, B, and C virus and the likelihood of
clicking on the link to visit the website. Interest was aroused in
the invitation by challenging the potential visitor regarding their
knowledge about hepatitis and it was emphasized that the
website provided this information in a comprehensible manner .
Not only could interest be aroused in the invitation for HPV
vaccination for girls and their parents but also, for instance, via
other channels by which the target group is reached (eg, the
internet, social media). In addition, research has shown a
positi ve recommendation by word of mouth to be an important
trigger for visiting a web-based interv ention for the first time
[19]. Word-of-mouth recommendations could be encouraged
by providing “tell-a-friend” services at the web-based
interv ention [19].
Of the mothers that logged in to the interv ention, nearly all
visited at least one component. However, a small portion of the
mothers (10.76%) did not view any of the interv ention’ s content
after having logged in. This is likely due to technical difficulties
because at follow up, some mothers (320, 12.75%) indicated
that they were not able to see or hear the virtual assistants.
On average, time of website use, indicating the time mothers
spent with the interv ention, was adequate (21.39 minutes). This
is longer than that reported by Brouwer and colleagues [26] in
their review of web-based, interacti ve health y lifestyle
interv entions, in which interv ention exposure time varied from
less than 10 minutes to 10-20 minutes. However, the present
exposure time was lower than found by Sanders and colleagues
[64] for their interacti ve, web-based tailored interv ention
promoting colorectal cancer screening (33 minutes). This
difference could be explained by the controlled setting of their
study [64], in which participants arrived 60 minutes prior to a
medical appointment and viewed the interv ention in the waiting
room in the presence of a research assistant.
In addition, the mean completeness of the interv ention was
50.04%. This indicates that the interv ention fits well with the
mothers’ needs, which is also supported by the results regarding
acceptability (see below). The mean completeness in this study
is comparable to that found by Watts and colleagues [65], who
reported a completeness of 49.09% for a web-based prostate
cancer screening decision aid.
Use of Inter vention Components
When looking at exposure to interv ention components, we found
that mothers were most interested in the effectiveness of
(alternati ve) methods to protect against cervical cancer (88.03%
visited) and the risks of their daughter getting infected with
HPV and developing cervical cancer (86.87% visited). These
appear to be essential components of communication about
HPV vaccination.
The “Value Clarif ication” component was visited the least
overall (13.09%). This may be attrib uted to the fact that it was
not easily found by participants: this page was only accessible
once mothers completed the component “Weighing Pros and
Cons. ” Vonck en-Bre wster and colleagues [66] also found that
participants overlook ed a certain part of their interv ention, and
they successfully impro ved its visibility by repositioning it. Inorder to promote exposure to values clarif ication, we could
enhance its visibility .
The “General Information” component was completed the most
overall (72.24%). This is likely due to the fact that the
mother -like virtual assistant recommended starting with this
component when mothers first entered the main menu, and that
it was brief (2 pages). “Side Effects” and “Effectivity” were
completed the least (both 0.85%). This could be explained by
the fact that these two components contained the most links to
in-depth information. Only a small proportion of the mothers
(≤13.22%) visited in-depth information.
Program Acceptability
The mothers evaluated the website as positi ve, as shown by the
overall acceptability (7.64/10) and the scores on all acceptability
measures (mean scores ranging from 4.34 to 5.71 on a 7-point
Likert scale). The virtual assistants were also well appreciated
(7.41/10). This is likely because it matched with the mothers’
preferences for more interacti ve personalized feedback [40].
This adequate acceptability is similar to the findings of Paiva
and colleagues [67] for a web-based tailored interv ention to
increase HPV vaccination among young adult women (3.27/4.0).
We belie ve the high acceptability in the present study can be
attrib uted to the systematic and user-centered development
process of the interv ention [7]. The target group was extensi vely
involved throughout the development. Not only did we fine-tune
the content of the interv ention to the mothers’ preferences and
requirements but this also was considered in the design of the
website, which was chosen by the mothers.
Furthermore, we found a positi ve relationship between
acceptability and completeness (P<.001). This association was
also found by others in a web-based interv ention for breast
cancer [68-70]. This finding underlines the importance of an
interv ention to be considered appropriate by the target group.
Effects of Program Use on Inter vention Outcomes
In line with our expectations, completeness had a signif icant
positi ve effect on all outcome measures (IDM, decisional
conflict, social-psychological determinants of HPV vaccination
uptak e), including actual HPV vaccination uptak e itself. Mothers
who had completed more of the interv ention were more likely
to have their daughter vaccinated against HPV, and had higher
levels of IDM and more positi ve scores on determinants of HPV
vaccination acceptance. In particular , the effect on HPV
vaccination uptak e is an important finding, which was not found
when simply contrasting the experimental to the control
condition [30]. This stresses the importance of conducting a
process analysis alongside such an effect evaluation. These
results are very promising, considering the currently low HPV
vaccination uptak e rates in the Netherlands [6].
We belie ve that these positi ve effects can be attrib uted to the
extensi ve tailoring throughout the interv ention. Support for this
notion comes from the study results indicating that mothers
percei ved the interv ention to be well-tailored (5.22 on a 7-point
scale). Not only did we tailor the content of the interv ention to
the mothers’ personal interest, it was also used to guide the
mothers’ personal route through the interv ention. The latter is
likely to have impro ved the usability of the interv ention.

RenderXMoreo ver, the interv ention accounted for tailoring on a variety
of themes. For example, it considered percei ved barriers similar
to the approach taken by Gerend and colleagues [9] as well as
other beliefs, attitudes, subjecti ve norms, habits, relati ve
effectiveness, anticipated regret, risk perception, self-ef ficacy,
and knowledge.
In contrast to our expectations, time of website use had a
positi ve effect on all outcomes (P<.003), except for risk
perception when not vaccinated (P=.14), subjecti ve norms
(P=.03), habit (P=.01), and vaccination uptak e (P=.20). The
latter is also in contrast to findings of a previous study [64]. An
explanation for this lack of effects may be the measurement we
used for time of website use, which may be less reliable for
measuring exposure. We measured the total time spent on the
website, but this does not indicate the specif ic pages the mothers
had visited and for how long. In addition, we were unable to
determine if there were any timeouts during a session and what
the duration of a timeout was, because the interv ention was
web-based. For instance, they could have been distracted in the
home environment during website use, which may have
influenced the measured time of website use and may also have
caused the lack of effect of acceptability on time of website use.
An alternati ve, more accurate, measure can be found within the
domain of education, namely time on task [71]. Future studies
are needed to examine whether time on task (instead of total
time of website use) has a positi ve influence on uptak e.
Methodological Considerations
There are three methodological considerations. First, as
mentioned above, the measurement of total time spent on the
website seemed to be not entirely adequate to measure program
use. In this study , completeness seemed to be a better indicator
of use as it demonstrates the mother’ s navigation through the
website, whereas time of website use did not. In addition, within
(almost) every component, mothers were first asked a question
about an HPV -related topic. The page was mark ed as
“completed” if they provided an answer , which was necessary
to obtain tailored feedback. Within the decisional balance,
completeness was calculated based on the mother’ s answer to
each statement. These are more complete indicators of actual
use. Nevertheless, it is not an entirely complete indicator for
use, since we could not measure whether they read generic
information, listened to the tailored feedback from the virtual
assistant, or saw a video. This may have influenced the
dose-response effects found.
Second, considering the aim of initiating active processing of
information, the positi ve effect found of completeness on habit
may seem unwanted. However, at follow up, the mothers had
already been exposed to the interv ention, and were therefore
likely to have actively processed the information. These results
may indicate that the more mothers completed the interv ention,
the less they had to think about getting the HPV vaccine. The
interv ention may have helped them make a decision rather than
inducing perceptions about HPV vaccination as something you
take for granted, without thinking. In retrospect, the label “habit”
appears to be misleading.
Third, the effect sizes found were small, which is in line with
other web-based interv entions targeting health behavioroutcomes [72]. Despite this, we belie ve that even small effects
are of relevance in public health as they become substantial at
the population level. After all, in the Netherlands, approximately
100,000 girls are invited to recei ve the HPV vaccine on a yearly
basis.
Strengths and Limitations
The most important strength of this study is that we, to our
knowledge, are the first within the field of HPV vaccination to
conduct an extensi ve process evaluation. According to a review
[24], the process evaluation of an interv ention promoting HPV
vaccination acceptance by tailoring information to participants’
percei ved barriers, such as that performed by Gerend and
colleagues [9], was limited to the evaluation of interv ention
information (eg, the extent to which the information was
informati ve and convincing). Other notable strengths are the
objecti ve measurement of HPV vaccination uptak e, the
dose-response effect of completeness on actual HPV vaccination
uptak e, the broad focus on outcomes (ie, determinants of HPV
vaccination acceptance, uptak e, IDM, and decisional conflict),
and the adequate level of both (objecti vely assessed) program
use and acceptability .
However, some limitations need to be addressed. First, there
appeared to be technical difficulties despite our best effort to
minimize such issues (eg, by extensi vely pilot testing the website
using various devices). For instance, it turned out that a portion
of the mothers were unable to see or hear the virtual assistants
and that certain components did not work adequately among
some of the mothers. Such technical difficulties are likely to
have influenced website usability and therefore may have had
a negative impact on program use. Second, this eHealth
interv ention requires mothers to have eHealth literac y [73].
People with lower eHealth literac y have been shown to have a
lower educational level and to spend less time online [74,75].
It could be interesting to examine the extent to which eHealth
literac y might have influenced use, acceptability , and effects.
Considering the latter , we do not expect substantial differences
since we did not find any differences in interv ention effects
among mothers with a low vs high educational level [30]. Third,
it was hard to compare the study results to other studies because
data on program use are often very poorly reported or even
completely lacking (for a review, see [20]). Furthermore, the
study was subject to a considerable amount of attrition. This is
a common finding in studies on eHealth interv entions [20].
Dropout appeared higher , for example, among mothers with a
lower educational level, which has also been reported for other
web-based tailored interv entions [76]. In this study , missing
data and selecti ve dropout were handled by using multiple
imputation [55,56]. Fortunately , there were nearly no differences
between the results from the complete case analyses and the
ITT analyses. Therefore, it seems unlik ely that the effects found
are spurious or due to selecti ve dropout. Finally , caution is
needed when generalizing the results of this study to the general
population (ie, Dutch mothers of 12-year -old girls) because we
were unable to check the representati veness of the sample.
Besides, it should be noted that a very homogenous sample was
reached. An undiversified reach is a known phenomenon within
web-based interv entions aimed at health promotion [20]. In our
study , the mothers were predominantly born in the Netherlands,

RenderXhighly educated, and likely to have a daughter that was
vaccinated against HPV. However, results from the effect
evaluation showed no differences in interv ention effects in
specif ic subgroups of participants, as indicated by moderation
analyses with sociodemographic variables [30].
Conclusions and Recommendations
This process evaluation has demonstrated that program use and
acceptability of the web-based tailored HPV vaccination
interv ention were adequate. We found a positi ve association
between completeness and acceptability . Furthermore,
dose-response effects were found for completeness and time of
website use on (nearly) all social-psychological determinants
of the mothers’ decision making about vaccination, levels of
IDM, and decisional conflict. Importantly , the extent to which
mothers completed the interv ention positi vely influenced their
daughters’ actual HPV vaccination uptak e. These results indicate
that this web-based, tailored interv ention fits well with the
mothers’ needs and has the potential to increase HPV
vaccination uptak e. Because of the interv ention’ s adequate
(dose-response) effects and acceptability , the interv ention hasrecently been incorporated into the national HPV vaccination
communication alongside the existing communication materials.
We recommend future interv entions promoting HPV vaccination
acceptance to (1) incorporate a process evaluation alongside
the effect evaluation, (2), include strate gies to arouse interest
so as to expand reach, and to (3) include time on task. In
addition, we recommend investigating the influence of different
media types (eg, graphic vs nongraphic presentations) on
decision making about HPV vaccination. For instance, Cox and
colleagues [77] found that parents who viewed a graphic
presentation of HPV -related risk information had a higher HPV
vaccination intention compared to parents who viewed a
nongraphic presentation. Furthermore, we recommend future
research to examine differences in use and acceptability in
specif ic subgroups of participants, for example by conducting
moderation analyses with sociodemographics (eg, educational
level). Finally , we recommend developing similar interv ention
models for (a) target groups other than mothers (eg, the daughter
or sons in case they will become a next target group for HPV
vaccination) and (b) other vaccinations (eg, maternal pertussis
vaccination).
