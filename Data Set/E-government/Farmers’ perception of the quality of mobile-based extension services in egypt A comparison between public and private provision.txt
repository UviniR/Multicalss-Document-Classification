Abstract
During the last 10 years, different initiatives have been implemented to provide mobile-based extension
services for the agricultural sector in Egypt. The current study compared the quality of agricultural extension
messages between public and private providers. A simple random sample of 120 farmers was selected repre-
senting 7% of the total farmers registered in the databases of Ministry of Agriculture (public services) and
Shoura company (private services). Farmers assessed a sample of 10 messages delivered by both providers in
terms of six indicators namely (1) access, (2) utilization, (3) timeliness, (4) trust, (5) satisfaction, and (6) sharing
information with other farmers. The findings revealed the lack of access to messages by the farmers in the two
services. However, more than 50% had utilized the majority of messages (in case of access). The study also
showed significant differences between perception of farmers to quality attributes in public and private services
(Access 6.77, 0.01; Utilization 8.44, 0.004; Timeliness 8.55, 0.002; Satisfaction 8.88, 0.001; information sharing
7.62, 0.009) except for trust (1.11, 0.4). Findings provide practical implications to support mobile-based
extension services to enable sharing information and link farmers with other actors in the agricultural value
chain.

Introduction
The agricultural sector is the fourth largest contributor
(11.2 %) to the Egyptian economy’s GDP in 2015,
besides providing employment to around 29 %of the
workforce (FAOSTAT, 2016). The Egyptian govern-
ment has been taking advantage in employing ICT
systems in the agricultural sector to encourage syner-
gies between the different parties in the agricultural
value chain (Yonazi et al., 2012). In recent years, ICTrepresents a tremendous opportunity for rural popula-
tions to reduce risks, find new employment opportu-
nities, and enhance their quality of life (World Bank,

2017). According to Kora and Kassem (2010), ICT
services for the agriculture sector in Egypt play a key
role due to different reasons as follows: agriculture
has been the main occupation of a large segment of
population for a long time, information asymmetry is
very high in this sector, and most of the farmers in
Egypt are located in rural and remote areas.
Agricultural extension systems and other actors in
agricultural innovation system (AIS) have been iden-
tified as the most important sources for information
access in developing countries (Mittal and Tripathi,
2009). The affordable access to relevant information
and knowledge services is an effective and efficient
mechanism to facilitate crops life cycle (Bhavnani
et al., 2008). Consequently, development of ICT ser-
vices can transform and enhance interaction patterns
in innovations systems (Munthali et al., 2018).
Among other ICTs, mobiles are arguably the most
ubiquitous modern technology of the majority of the
urban and even the rural masses (Ansari and Pandey,
2013). According to Statista report, the number of
smartphone users worldwide raised to around 2.32
billion in 2017 and could increase to 2.71 billion by
2019 (Staista, 2017). In Egypt, while the population is
94.8 million in 2016 (Central Agency for Public
Mobilization and Statistics CAPMAS, 2017), the
number of mobile subscribers reached to 97,791,441
in 2016, among them the number of smartphone users
in Egypt raised from 12.6 million in 2013 to 23.7
million in 2017 (MCIT, 2017). The most common
service provided by mobile is still SMS (Short Mes-
sage Service [SMS]): in addition Multimedia Mes-
sages Service (MMS) facilitate communication,
information, and sharing knowledge on various
aspects of agriculture (Ahi, 2014; Allahyari and Chi-
zari, 2010).
Mobile-enabled solutions for agricultural exten-
sion services in developing countries include provid-
ing agricultural information, enhancing access to the
market, access to financial services and improving
data visibility for supply-chain efficiency (Nakasone,
2014; World Bank, 2012). Furthermore, Cole and Fer-
nando (2012) pointed out that mobiles reduce the cost
of individual visits, enhance feedback between farm-
ers and extension workers, and overcome lack of
extensionists and poor infrastructure. Consequently,
assessment of mobile utilization by the farmers and
its impact on agriculture has been a key research area
over the past decade (Aldosari et al.,2017; Car et al.,
2012; Dey et al., 2016; Engotoit et al., 2016; Ganesan
et al., 2013; 2015; Hasan, 2015; Krone et al., 2014;2016; Okuboyejo and Ade jo, 2012; Tadesse and
Bahiigwa, 2015; Verma and Sinhab, 2018; Wijeratne
and De Silva, 2014; Wyche and Steinfield, 2016).
Quality of mobile services is considered as a direct
result of work processes occurring in an environment of
extension. The goal of service delivery is to enable farm-
ers to make better-informed decisions related to improv-
ing their agricultural practices and livelihoods (Mur
et al., 2016). Thus, farmers’ perception of the service
quality has an influence on adoption behavior (Tata and
Mcnamara, 2017). Numerous studies have shown that
quality attributes of a service include: (1) timeliness of
delivery, (2) adequacy of service, (3) relevance to farm-
ers needs, (4) problem solved, (5) efficiency in the mon-
itoring and evaluation of the service by the provider, (6)
availability of the service for possible use by the farmer,
and (7) sharing information to other farmers (Agholor
et al., 2013; Buadi et al., 2013). A provider’s success in
service delivery depends upon the availability of high
levels of quality attributes (Agholor et al., 2013). It is not
enough that they are available, or even accessible; they
must be tailored to different users who need them to gain
the value of a service.
The real-time advisory for agriculture is the most
challenging information service. Many public and pri-
vate institutions have invested heavily in ICT services
in creating efficient, real-time mobile-based exten-
sion (FAO, 2012). In Egypt, the Ministry of Agricul-
ture established agricultu ral information delivery
mobile services since 2011. The aim of this service
was to overcome the challenge of an inadequate num-
ber of qualified agricultural officers through the dis-
semination of timely agricultural information to the
farming communities for better and informed decision
making at the farm (Shabana, 2016). Moreover, sev-
eral agribusiness companies have started providing
complete farm solutions at every stage of the supply
chain. The private sector provision of mobile-based
extension was a key way for responsiveness to farmer
needs, accountability, and sustainable business devel-
opment in the long run (Ali, 2013).
In Egypt, some studies dealing with an institution
based communication network (VERCON), which
was established in Egypt in 2002 and was later
expanded into the Rural and Agricultural Develop-
ment Communication Network (RADCON), have
been presented (for example, FAO, 2010; Kassem,
2005; Kaul et al., 2008), but to our knowledge, none
of them has investigated the quality of mobile based
extension. The gap in organizing m-based extension
by the public and private providers in Egypt and2 Information Development XX(X)farmers’ use and benefit prompted this study. The
main objectives of the study were to assess farmers’
perception of the quality of services provided by
Shoura company (private) and Ministry of Agricul-
ture (public) and determine the differences between
the two services according to the quality attributes.
Review of literature
Quality of extension services
Service quality has been the focus of previous stud-
ies from a customer-focused perspective due to its
effect on meeting the expectations of customers (Zhu
et al., 2018).
Service quality can be identified as a gap between
perceived performance and expectations (Reimann
et al., 2008). Furthermore, other scholars see service
quality as perceptions of overall corporate quality of
the product or service, physical environment, delivery
systems, and outcome quality (Karatepe, 2013). Ser-
vice quality can be measured by six main dimensions;
tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, accessibility and
trustworthiness, professionalism and skills, and empa-
thy (Yarimoglu, 2014). The consequences of perceived
quality of the services have been investigated in many
studies in three main ways: assessment of the attitude
or perception of the customers towards quality, effect
of service quality on satisfaction, and effect of internal
factors of the company on achieving quality (Archa-
kova, 2013; Ghimire, 2012; Felix, 2017; Malik, 2012;
Tavanazadeh and Aligholi, 2014).
Quality of agricultural extension services is identi-
fied as a capability of extension systems to deliver
services in a way to affect agricultural productivity
and food security (Ragasa and Mazunda, 2018). The
extension managers are accountable for farmers to
provide quality educational programs by following all
standards and regulations required (Agholor, 2013).
Hence, agricultural extension services should be
designed and implemented to ensure accountability
by adopting demand-driven approach and promoting
farmers’ participating in extension programmes at all
levels (Omotesho et al., 2015).
Information access
Information access reflects the individual’s ability to
identify and obtain data from various sources effec-
tively (Burnett and Jaeger, 2008). According to Bur-
nett et al. (2008), there are three components of
access: physical, intellectual, and social. Physicalaccess refers to the electronic structures that contain
information. Intellectual access includes ways of
understanding information in terms of categorizing,
organizing, displaying, and representing. The con-
cept of social access discusses how social norms and
beliefs influence the information one accesses.
Accordingly, access to information is not only vital
for clients to fulfill their needs, it is an essential
component for organizations to achieve governance,
open competition, tendering, and for ensuring an
effective market for services (Haraldsdottir et al.,
2018).
In client-oriented agricultural extension where
information access is farmer-led and commodified
(in case of private extension), the farmer should
have a right to access information needed. Farm-
ers’ access to information has been hindered by
multiple constraints in developing countries such
as illiteracy, financial is sues, poor infrastructure,
poor communication methods, and lack of exten-
sion staff numbers (Mawazo, 2015). The mobile
phone could play a key role in enhancing better
access to agricultural information. It accelerates
speed, time and volume of diffusion and reduces
the effort done by using other personal or group
methods (Amir et al., 2016). Public and private
extension services aim to gain value added beyond
information access to farmers in terms of increas-
ing farm productivity, im proving quality, reducing
production costs, encouraging collaboration
between service providers and farmers, and pro-
viding alternative market channels (Million,
2016; Wyche and Steinfield, 2016).
Drawing on the literature review, the following
hypothesis is given:
H1:There are significant differences between pub-
lic and private providers regarding farmers’ access
to mobile-based extension services.
Utilization
Information utilization h as been defined as a method
for describing how information is being used in the
work setting which influences the decision-making
process and leads to the reduction of uncertainty
within an organization (Kont io et al., 2013). Organi-
zational internal factors p lay a critical role in influ-
encing information acquisition such as client’s
orientation, organizationa l culture, and organiza-
tional culture (Douglas, 2017). Identification andKassem et al: Farmers’ perception of the quality of mobile-based extension services in Egypt 3development of these factor s can be valuable tools to
design an effective information system that facili-
tates interaction between t he company and their sta-
keholders (Karim, 2011). Rollins et al. (2012) find
that the research work dealing with information uti-
lization has three different measures: instrumental;
deals with how results are being directly used for
solving the problems, conceptual; use of results in
an indirect way to solve the problem via making
inferences, and symbolic; use of findings beyond
their intended use to gain value added by applying
it in other contexts.
Utilization of agricultural innovations is a pillar
for sustainable agriculture. Agricultural extension
services worldwide have utilized personal, group
and mass approaches to disseminate information and
convince farmers to adopt (Kingiri and Nderitu,
2014). In recent years, agricultural extension ser-
vices highly depend on information communication
technologies as a cost-effective tool for information
sharing (Asa and Uwem, 2017). Different studies
reported the result from the use of information sent
via mobile such as market access, efficient use of
agricultural inputs, saving of time, networking with
other parties in the agricultural value chain, and cre-
ating feedback channels (Asa, 2015; Chhachar and
Hassan, 2013). However, d espite the positive effect
of mobile-based extension services, farmers face
constraints which hamper them in the utilization of
agricultural information. Socio-economic character-
istics of farmers and attitu des towards quality attri-
butes of information provided have been found to
have a positive effect on ut ilization of information
(Asa, 2015; Velandia et al., 2009; Wanjohi, 2015).
Thus, we propose H2:
H2:There are significant differences between pub-
lic and private providers regarding farmers’ utiliza-
tion of mobile-based extension services.
Timeliness
Timeliness can be defined as the provision of infor-
mation to clients quickly enough for them to take
action and to keep them satisfied (Lenio Business
Services Limited, 2014). From an organizational
view, the timeliness concept is of particular impor-
tance to financial statements, to analyze variance, to
establish and to assign responsibilities, and to report
(Bragg, 2014). In marketing, timeliness matters for
delivering quality services and building a reputationfor five reasons as follows: accelerating sales,
understanding customer’s feelings and their feed-
back, optimizing the voice channel, high demand
from the customers, and thriving in customer ser-
vice (Golkar, 2016). Various companies have been
striving to improve the timeliness by improving
internal factors within company’s delivery systems,
continuous monitoring along the supply chain,
respect promises and apologize when you can’t, and
seeking help from external consultancy company to
improve customer service, if necessary (Bortone,
2016).
In the context of agricultural extension, delaying
the provision of agricultural information needed by
farmers could have negative consequences on agri-
cultural production (Buadi et al., 2013). Isaac (2017)
found in his study that trust and satisfaction of the
farmers were positively affected by the accuracy and
timeliness of the extension services. In order to
ensure timeliness of agricultural extension services,
Mittal and Mehar (2012) suggest delivering the agri-
cultural information based on demand-driven and
fostering two-way communication with farmers to
provide innovations and enable their feedback. Thus,
we propose H3:
H3:There are significant differences between pub-
lic and private providers regarding the timeliness of
mobile-based extension services as perceived by
farmers.
Trust
Trust as a mental process describes the customer’s
experiencing the reality of the products, interpreta-
tion, and then expectation (McKnight et al., 1998).
Psychologically, trust consists of the intention to
accept or avoid based upon expectations perceived
from the behavior of others (Rousseau et al., 1998).
Trust as an organizational concept focuses on rela-
tionships in intra and inter levels to gain the loyalty
of the clients (Chiou et al., 2002). From the economic
perspective, trust reflects customers’ view towards
transaction costs of services as an indicator to build
relationships between business and customers (Moore
and de Bruin, 2004). Trust plays a central role in
strengthening human relations in different contexts.
It helps in supporting social capital, confidence and
relying on others, developing loyalty, enhancing
respect, and promoting reputation of the company
(Ezezika et al., 2012; Hsu et al., 2015; Nguyen et al,4 Information Development XX(X)2013; Rasheed and Abadi, 2014; Unidha, 2017). Trust
in a service or in a company will be affected by the
perception of the customers towards the quality of
services (Chenet et al., 2010; Rasheed and Abadi,
2014; Shpe ¨tim, 2012; Unidha, 2017).
The effectiveness of farmers’ partnership in
extension services ultimately depends on their trust
in the competences of exte nsion workers and their
satisfaction with the perceived value of the services
provided (Zawojska, 2010). However other organi-
zational factors such as extension links with agri-
cultural policy and government interests,
negatively effect farmers’ trust in extension (Petro-
vic´ ,e ta l .2 0 0 9 ) .As t u d yc o n d u c t e db yS t u a r te ta l .
(2018) shows that farmers give their preference to
private sources to get their information and follow
their recommendations. Different procedures could
be considered to build trust between farmers and
extension such as maintaining reliable relation-
ships, paying attention to farmers on a more fre-
quent basis, and timely delivery of extension
services (Turyahikayo and Kamagara, 2016). Thus,
we propose H4:
H4:There are significant differences between pub-
lic and private providers regarding farmers’ trust in
mobile-based extension services.
Satisfaction
There are two most popular approaches used in liter-
ature to highlight the meaning of satisfaction. The
first approach emphasizes the result of customer’s
consumption of a product or service (Grigoroudis and
Siskos, 2010). The second approach defines satisfac-
tion as the psychological process resulted from com-
paring expectations with mental performance
(Tavanazadeh and Aligholi, 2014). Client satisfaction
is very crucial because it helps to explore the com-
pany’s strength and weakness (Arachova, 2013).
Furthermore, it supports information about custom-
ers’ needs, expectations, and preferences (Ghimire,
2012). According to Farris et al., (2010), organiza-
tions will use the results of client’s satisfaction as a
metric for enhancing internal quality processes. Satis-
faction can be measured by objective factors (e.g.,
business idea and marketing, product features) and
subjective (e.g., customer’s background, needs, emo-
tions) (Ihalainen, 2011).
In the field of agricultural extension, satisfaction
is conceptualized as feedback of the farmerstowards the extension services provided. Different
factors affect farmers’ satisfaction of extension ser-
vices, such as farmer’s personal and farm attributes,
frequency of extension contact with farmers, per-
ceived relative advantage and economic return of
information, use of multiple communication meth-
ods, access to subsidies and incentives, and rele-
vance of information to their needs and farming
systems (Ganpat et al., 2014). In their research,
Ganesan et al. (2015) found that the majority of
farmers were very satisfied with agricultural infor-
mation disseminated through their mobile phone in
terms of content, the simplicity of language, and
audio quality. Similar results were developed by
Lu et al. (2017), where farmers perceived satisfac-
tion to be positive as a result of using information
communication technologies to gain knowledge.
Thus, we propose H5:
H5:There are significant differences between pub-
lic and private providers regarding farmers’ satis-
faction of mobile-based extension services.
Information sharing
Information sharing describes the exchange of data
in terms of the content, type, and frequency in dif-
ferent levels; individuals, organizations, and soft-
ware/firmware (Hilary et a l., 2017; Lefebvre et al.,
2016). Information sharing improves members’ abil-
ity to align strategic plans, enhance knowledge,
reduces cost through networking with other actors,
and generates collective action which leads to a con-
ducive environment for collaboration (Holweg et al.,
2005; Ketzenberg 2009; Li and Lin, 2006; Wever
et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2014). The quality of infor-
mation is the main determinant to clarify the signifi-
cance of sharing and usefulness of information (Li
and Lin, 2006). In other words, information volume,
content, and channel used should be considered to
ensure effective transfer of information (Watabaji
et al., 2016).
Mobile phone technology has been used to share
agricultural information to farmers due to the
extension of telecommunication networks in rural
areas all over the developed and developing coun-
tries (Anjum, 2015). Differ ent initiatives have been
provided to empower farmers to share information
via mobile phones (Adamides and Stylianou,
2013). Text messages are more accessible and less
expensive to maintain the flow of information evenKassem et al: Farmers’ perception of the quality of mobile-based extension services in Egypt 5to those who do not access Internet services (Kar-
amagi and Nakirya, 2016). Information sharing
using mobile phone encourages farmers’ learning
and promotes feedback regarding agricultural inno-
vations (Sousa et al., 2016). Moreover, research by
Mbatia et al., (2010), conf irmed that information
sharing establishes partnerships between farmers
and other actors along the value chain. Thus, we
propose:
H6:There are significant differences between pub-
lic and private providers regarding sharing infor-
mation of mobile-based extension services as
perceived by farmers.
Methods
Study area
The current study was carried out in Dakhalia gover-
norate in the Northeast of Egypt. This governorate is
3,500 km2and had a population of approximately
6,000,000.The majority of residents in the governor-
ate live in rural areas, with an urbanization rate of
28.2%. Out of an estimated 5,949,001 people residing
in the governorate, 4,271,428 people live in rural
areas as opposed to 1,677,573 in urban areas (CAP-
MAS, 2017).
The public m-extension is administrated by the
mobile department at the Ministry of Agriculture in
all governorates. In terms of private services, only two
agricultural companies called Syngenta and Shoura
were found to provide m-extension to the farmers in
the governorate. For the reason of easy access to farm-
ers’ databases, researchers selected the company of
Shoura for chemicals and pesticides to represent the
private m-extension.
Elsenbalwin district was purposively selected to
collect data about delivering private m-extension due
to the large number of farmers registered in the pri-
vate services databases in this district. Similarity Tal-
kha district was selected for gathering data form
farmers registered in the databases of public m-
extension. Three villages in each district were ran-
domly selected for data collection from the farmers
who have exposure to public and private m-extension
services.
Data collection
The total number of farme rs registered in both
Shoura’s databases and public services reached 633
and 1000 farmers respectively in the Dakahliagovernorate. Data were collected using a random
sampling technique from 120 farmers representing
around 7 %of the total farmers in the two services
(60 farmers from each service). Researchers selected
20 farmers in each village of NoubTarif, Toukh El-
Aklam, and Bandr-Elsenbalwin to assessing private
services in Elsenbalwin district and the villages of
Banrtalkha, Derin, and Meet-Elkorma to measure
public services in the Talkha district.
Data were collected using a semi-structured inter-
view and questionnaire. Two semi-structured inter-
views were conducted with the manager of
marketing of Shoura company and the other one with
the director of the mobile department at the Ministry
of Agriculture. The meeting index consists of some
questions to describe the profile of the services in
terms of objectives, organizing, and results. The ques-
tionnaire was broadly divided into two parts compris-
ing data on socio-economic characteristics of the
farmers and the quality of messages delivered by pri-
vate and public services. The study focused on six
quality attributes of mobile-based agricultural exten-
sion, namely (1) access, (2) utilization, (3) timeliness,
(4) trust, (5) satisfaction, and (6) sharing information
with other farmers.
The index of SMS messages studied was obtained
from the databases of the public and private services.
Ten messages delivered to farmers during the
winter season of 2016/2017 were selected for mea-
surement. Data were collected during the summer
season of the same year in the period of May until
June 2017.
Data analysis
Farmer’s access of agricultural information reflects
delivering and reading SMS messages sent by the
two services. The numeric values for the farmers’
access to messages were assigned as 1 for yes, 0 for
no. In the case of access, the farmer was asked to
assess his utilization of the message. Farmer’s
utilization was measured by adoption of messages
in the farming system. The numeric values for the
utilization were assigned as 1 for yes, 0 for no. In
case of adoption, the farmers were asked to express
their views of four indicators on a three-point rating
scale as follows: timeliness (accurate, somewhat,
inaccurate), trust (direct application after receiving,
after discussion with my neighbours, after applica-
tion of others), satisfaction (satisfied, somewhat,
unsatisfied), and information sharing with other6 Information Development XX(X)farmers (large number, small number, no). The
responses of all four indicators were assigned as
2,1,0 respectively. The maximum score of quality per
respondent was 10 per message with a total of (100),
while the minimum was (0). Farmers’ responses to
the quality attribute of each message were calculated
by using relative weight ( %) as follows (Khoshnodi-
far et al., 2012):PPi/C2wiPn/C2Wmax/C2100 :
(Pi¼Each parameter amount; Wi ¼Each para-
meter weight; Wmax: The maximum weight that can
belong to each parameter (2); n: The number of each
factor parameters)
Other descriptive statistical techniques were used
as frequency, percentages, and z-score, in addition,
t-test for determining the significant differences
between the private and pu blic services regarding
z-scores of quality attributes.
Results
Profile of m-services provided by Shoura company
(private) and Ministry of Agriculture (public)
This section gives a brief description of the two
m-services studied with respect to history and objec-
tives of the two services, organizing the provision of
the services, the content of messages, and cost and
revenue. Details of the two m-services are provided
in Appendix 1.
Shoura. Shoura is a private company providing
m-services since 2013 to be compatible with the
new trends in marketing map of international com-
panies. The major objectives being pursued are
better access to information, improving efficiency
in supply chain, advertising for new products, and
ensuring farmers’ loyalty for the company’s prod-
ucts. The procedures of registration require filling
the application, attending one of the extension
workshops held by the company, and activating
the service by clicking the message sent to the
farmer’s mobile. Shoura provides advertising and
extension services in different agricultural areas.
Evaluation reports in 2016 indicated that 60 %of
farmers who received m-services adopt the
recommendations.
Ministry of Agriculture. This is a public m-service which
started in Egypt in 2011 to increase the income
through better access to information and services and
saving time and effort of extension workers. Farmerscould register for MOA’s services by calling the hot-
line number to activate the services. It assists farmers
by providing extension services in multiple fields.
The monitoring plan to assess the impact of services
is not undertaken. This service still depends on the
extension workers in the village to deal with the prob-
lems in the case of the ineffectiveness of the services
provided.

the majority of the farmers (72.5 %) had small land-
holding (<5Feddan). Regarding activities of agri-
cultural production, the r esults revealed that less
than two-thirds (63 %) cultivate vegetables, (21 %)
cultivate crops, while (14 %) cultivate crops and
vegetables. This shows that small-scale farmers
depended mainly on diverse agricultural production
especially vegetables to maximize their profit.

ranked first (91.7 %). The overall mean value of farm-
ers who had not accessed or don’t know whether they
received messages or not was 52.5 %. However, 80 %
who accessed the messages adopted the uploaded
information.
Table 4 refers to numbers of farmers who accessed
and utilized the messages sent by the Ministry of
Agriculture. The percentages of accessing ranged
from 10 %to 28.7 %. The overall mean was 15.5 %
which could be described as the very low rate of
access. The percentages o f utilization ranged from
zero to 76.5 %. Two messages were not adopted. The
message of “irrigate the wheat by following fast-
moving water method to o vercome unplanned heat
stress during this month” ranked at first order with
the percentage of 76.5 %.
Farmers who accessed the messages explored
their reasons for non-utilization as shown in Table
5. Lack of interest due to fragmented land owner-
ship, lack of trust, and lack of awareness of the
importance of m-extension with percentages of

constraints for adoption of private messages from
farmers’ point of view. Farmers who received pub-
lic m-extension mentioned that the main three con-
straints hinder their adoption were incompatibility
of information with cultiva ted crops or region, irre-
levance with farmers’ needs and problems, and
weak economic consequences with percentages of
67.2%,5 4 . 5 %,a n d4 5 . 4 %respectively.
Quality of messages sent by public and private
service providers
The summary results of quality attributes of the two
providers in each message are presented in Table 6.
The timeliness of the provision of Shoura
m-services is crucial in adopting the agricultural
messages under farm conditions. The majority of
farmers ( /C2180%) indicated that the messages were
provided on time by Shoura. With respect to trust in
Shoura’s messages, the respondents referred that
messages were not very reliable. The relative weight
of trust ranged from 41.7 %to 60 %in all messages.
Conversely, farmers perceived high satisfaction to
messages delivered with a low level of 80 %and
high level of 96.9 %. Information sharing is essen-
tial for sharing knowledge among farmers and net-
working with various actors in the agricultural
value chain. The respondents reported that theTable 4. Distribution of farmers who received public m-

*Farmers who accessed the messagesKassem et al: Farmers’ perception of the quality of mobile-based extension services in Egypt 9messages were highly shared with other farmers
with relative weights ranging from 70 %to 91.7 %.
Farmers who utilized public services showed that
only one message was described as fully integrated
concerning timeliness, trust , satisfaction, and infor-
mation sharing. Five messages were highly per-
ceived in terms of quality indicators by one-half
of the respondents at least.
To better understand the quality of each message
provided by Shoura and Ministry of Agriculture to
farmers, we further classified each message depend-
ing on six main quality indicators (Figure 1; Figure 2).
It can be noticed that the access of messages was still
under acceptable rates. Nevertheless, the farmers who
accessed the message expressed high levels in terms
of utilization, timeliness, satisfaction and sharing
information. Trust in messages received from Shoura
still occupied moderate levels from the respondents’
point of view. The same situation showed in messages
provided by Ministry of Agriculture. The trust indi-
cator was estimated higher than messages of Shoura
for the majority of public messages utilized by
farmers.
Mapping the various degrees of quality in all mes-
sages delivered by private and public services is
shown in Figure 3. Overall, the findings show thatacross all quality indicators there is a low level of
information access, utiliz ation, satisfaction, timeli-
ness and information sharing of public services in
comparison with private services. Trust in public ser-
vices is the only indicator viewed as slightly higher
than private services.
In order to further understand the differences
between the quality of messages provided by private
and public services, a t-test was estimated to deter-
mine the differences between z-scores of the quality
attributes (Table 7). Overall private service expecta-
tions are higher than public services. The indicators
significantly distinguishing between private and pub-
lic services are access (3.19, p<0.05), utilization
(4.11, p<0.05), timeliness (5.33, p<0.01), satisfaction
(7.11, p<0.01) and information sharing (6.33,
p<0.01). The public services score of trust was mar-
ginally better than private services, but it was not
significantly different (0.9, p>0.05).Table 5. Reasons of non-utilization of the messages

*Farmers who utilized the messages10 Information Development XX(X)Discussion
The research confirms that private services are
more efficient than public services in achieving
quality attributes especially in terms of access, uti-
lization, satisfaction, tim eliness, and information
sharing. Adoption of me ssages delivered by both
public and private services via information technol-
ogy like cell phones is crucial for modernization of
agriculture under local farming systems. This
implies that Shoura sent relevant information to
farmers’ crops and farmin g systems, in addition,
to implement on-farm demonstrations. Shoura con-
centrates on specific agro-chemical products not
broad information in different agricultural pro-
cesses like public services. Timeliness of sending
information is critical f or Shoura to enhance mar-
keting for raising sales. These results are in line
with the study of (Saravanan, and Bhattacharjee,
2015) in his analysis for public and private mobile
advisory services in India. He found that private
services (for example Lifelines India, FisherFriend, IFFCO Kisan Sanchar Limited, Reuters
Market Light, mKRISHI, Nokia Life Tools) were

reduce farmers’ needs in d ifferent agricultural
fields and find rural solu tions and facilitation with
different actors in the agricultural value chain.
The failure of accessing the messages is an impor-
tant area that needs to be addressed. The results
revealed that no messages are accessed by all respon-
dents in both services. Furthermore, more than half of
respondents at least reported that they had not
accessed the messages. It could be due to irrelevance
of the messages for the farmers, that messages were
not noticed by farmers for any reason or the farmers
didn’t update their data at service providers. How-
ever, other studies (for example Ahi, 2014, Ganesan
et al., 2013, Ganesan et al., 2015) have found that
mobile SMS messages help farmers to acquire ade-
quate and right information to increase their yield.

under local circumstances (Asa and Uwem,
2017). The results of our study show farmers who
received public mobile se rvices complain of the
irrelevance of information and lack of economic
consequences. This could be due to old and rou-
tine recommendations sent by Ministry of Agricul-
ture. On the other hand, constraints of cost and
lack of trust were found as determinants for adop-
tion by farmers who received private services.
Others (for example Etwire et al., 2017) have
found that poor network coverage and high elec-
tricity cost of operating a mobile phone were the
main constraints to the utilization of mobile
phone-based extension services. However, our
results are consistent with Siyao (2012) and
Wyche and Steinfield (2016).18.3

Figure 3. Mobile-based public services vs. private services.12 Information Development XX(X)Trust is a very important factor in forming a
positive attitude toward services among farmers
(Ezezika and Oh, 2012). Our results show that
farmers’ trust of the public or private services was
not high. This implies that farmers still felt lack of
trust may be due to unavailability of suitable infor-
mation sharing platforms such as on-farm demon-
strations. Building on research about trust building
processes for farmers (Ezezika et al., 2012), we
found that transparency of advantages and disad-
vantages of innovation, collaboration among stake-
holders, open communication between farmers and
representatives of public or private sector, and tak-
ing responsibility to adopt good management prac-
tices by farmers are four key strategies for
strengthening trust.
Conclusion
The quality of mobile-based agricultural extension
services provided by Ministry of Agriculture and
Shoura company was analyzed in Dakhlaia gover-
norate of Egypt. This analysis was based on a ran-
dom sample of farmers registered in the databases
of the two providers. Ten messages were selected
for investigating the perception of farmers on the
quality attributes of agricu ltural information. The
farmers rarely accessed the messages. However,
they highly utilized the majority of messages sent
b yS h o u r ac o m p a n yi nc o m p a r i s o nw i t hM i n i s t r yo f
Agriculture. Furthermore, the farmers had different
estimations regarding these services related to theirinformation sharing, timelin ess, satisfaction. Trust
of services was around average levels in both pub-
lic and private services from the farmer’s point of
view. Irrelevance of information with farmers’
crops and regions was cited as the main barrier for
utilization of messages pro vided by public services,
while lack of trust was the main factor for private
services messages.
Limitations and future research
This research has certain limitations, which should be
noted for future research. The study is limited to one
private provider as well a s one public provider of
mobile-based agricultural extension services. Selec-
tion of specific messages may show recall bias and
not represent the over all impact of information deliv-
ered to farmers in different fields of agriculture. The
instrument depends on six attributes for measuring
service quality. However, an indicator like relevance
to farmers’ needs was crucial to determine the capac-
ity of farmers to adopt the information received.
Matching the messages with farmers region and crops
before selecting the sample should be considered to
ensure accessing the messages by their end users. To
provide accurate responses concerning farmers per-
ception about the quality of services delivered to
them, there is a need to study the requirements for
improving the services to reach a framework for deli-
vering mobile-based agricultural extension services in
Egypt.Table 7. Differences between the quality of the public and private m-extension.
