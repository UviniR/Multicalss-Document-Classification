v ABOUT THE  DE4A  
 
This assessment of South Africa’s digital economy development has been launched as part of the World 
Bank Group’s (WBG) Digital Economy for Africa Initiative (DE4A) , launched in 2018 through a 
collaboration between the African Union and the World Bank Grou p. The initiative aims to ensure that 
every individual, business and government in Africa will be digitally enabled by 2030. The related 
diagnostic framework is based on a standardized methodology focused on five key foundations. In South 
Africa, the DE4A builds on the ICT deep dive carried out in the WBG Country Private Sector Diagnostic, 
the results of the advisory work on ICT regulation by the WBG competition team, and the next steps 
agreed between the WBG and government at the Digital Economy workshop h eld in Pretoria in 
November 2018. The assessment maps the strengths and weaknesses that characterize the national 
digital economy ecosystem (See Figure 1) and identifies challenges and opportunities for future growth.   
 
Figure 1: Five key foundations of the digital economy ecosystem  
 
The digital transformation is reshaping our global economy, permeating every sector and aspect of daily 
life – changing the way we learn, work, trade, socialize, access public and private services and  information  
(Figure 2).  In 2016, the global digital economy was worth some $11.5 trillion – equivalent to 15.5 percent 
of the world’s overall GDP. It is expected to reach 25 percent in less than a decade, quickly outpacing the 
growth of the overall econom y. However, countries like South Africa are still currently only capturing only 
a fraction of this growth and need to strategically invest in the foundational elements of their digital 
economy to keep pace.   
 
 
vi Universal adoption and effective application of  digital technology is expected to characterize economies 
of the future, shaping their ability to succeed in the global marketplace and offer a better quality of life 
for their citizens. Disruptive technologies are already altering traditional business mod els and pathways 
to development, yielding significant efficiency and productivity gains, increased convenience, as well as 
supporting better access to services for consumers. Well -functioning digital economies thus may offer 
potential to achieve faster eco nomic growth, offer innovative products and services, as well as create 
more job opportunities. The disruptive technologies coming onto the market also carry risks that need to 
be managed and mitigated, for example, job losses in industries affected by str uctural change and 
automation. Assessing where strategic investments and interventions need to be made is a critical first 
step to enabling digital economy growth.  
Figure 2: The digital economy can bring shared prosperity and reduced poverty  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The framework that shapes the assessment looks at five foundational elements of the digital economy:  
● Digital Infrastructure: the availability of affordable and quality internet, which is instrumental to 
bringing more people and businesses online.  
● Digital Public Platforms: the presence and use of digital platforms that can support greater digital 
exchange, transactions and access to public services online.  
● Digital Financial Services: the ability to pay, sa ve, borrow, and invest through digital means, which 
is key to financial inclusion and increasing the e -commerce market.  
● Digital Entrepreneurship: the presence of an ecosystem that supports entrepreneurs, startups 
and bigger companies to generate new produc ts and services that leverage new technologies and 
business models, including private platforms, which is critical to widen and deepen digital 
economic transformation.  
● Digital Skills: the development of a tech -savvy workforce, with both the basic and adva nced digital 
skills to support increased technology adoption and innovation and enable investments in high 
value -added services.  
 
 
vii This report aims to highlight opportunities to further develop South Africa’s digital economy with a special 
focus on policies that can bridge the digital divide and help South Africa achieve the DE4A targets . As 
discussed in the recent SCD, the legacy of exclusion presents unique challenges in South Africa, and this 
is true also in the digital space. Based on quantitative and qua litative assessments, and a series of more 
in-depth background papers on four of the DE4A’s five pillars (digital infrastructure, digital skills, digital 
entrepreneurship and digital financial services), the diagnostic findings provide recommendations that  
inform country targets and decisions on priority areas for development, proposing a mix of possible policy 
reforms and interventions.

xi      EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
 
 
The overall state of South Africa’s digital economy as viewed through the lens of the five foundational 
pillars is encouraging but momentum has stalled in recent years and much of the population remains 
excluded from the digital economy. With a PPP adjusted GDP per capita of USD 13 000, South Africa is 
among the few countries in Africa with upper -middle income status. On the digital economy, South Africa 
leads the region in indicators such as internet usage (54%) and mobile phone penetration (80%), and 
broadband coverage (99%). However, the nation slipped from 78th in the ITU ICT Development Index to 
92nd between 2002 and 2018 against the backdrop of a slowdown in economic gr owth. And when 
benchmarked against other middle -income countries and more dynamic economies, South Africa lags 
behind. Internet usage among poorer South Africans remains low with as much as 60% of the population 
paying more than the affordability benchmark  of 2% of GNI per capita.   
Proactive, effective, and coordinated government policies to holistically support the digital economy and 
could yield competitiveness, growth and jobs in South Africa. The World Bank Country Private Sector 
Diagnostic report identified ICT as a sector where medium -term reforms could unlock private investment. 
Already in 2013, an assessment showed that increased broadband investment of R 65 billion in the 
following 10 years could create more than 400,000 jobs and add R 1 30 billion in the GDP of South Africa1.  
Policies with strong monitoring and evaluation will be needed to reduce risks from increased automation 
and digitization. For example, doubling the rate at which the workforce acquires skills needed for the 4iR 
could reduce the proportion of at -risk-jobs from 33 percent to 14 percent by 2025.2 And as recently noted 
in South Africa’s Doing Business 2018 report for eight major cities, digitalization can remove red tape 
through government platforms that enhance the bu siness environment.  
South Africa has good potential to build on its strong foundations to continue to grow and expand its 
digital economy, including playing an increasing regional leadership role , and should boost efforts on 
digital infrastructure and skil ls in particular . A holistic, coordinated and whole of government view on the 
different actions necessary on each of the pillars, including their linkages, would help unlock maximum 
benefits. The diagnostic finds that South Africa should focus  efforts on current regulatory tools covering 
infrastructure and skills which need  to be better implemented and complemented with targeted 
interventions to help underserved segments of the country. Priority recommendations of the diagnostic 
include  for infrastructure,  updating the national broadband  policy  SA Connect in line with international 
best practices, fast -tracking spectrum licensing and ensuring the independence and capacity of ICASA , 
which  are measures that can unlock private investment and move South Africa towards universal coverage 
of high -speed and affordable internet. With regards to skills, government should consider improving the 
enrolment and completion rates in ICT studies as well as fostering more partnerships with private sector 
in reforming the cur riculum and providing resources to schools. Beyond these two pillars, a nchoring the  
different Digital Economy interventions across the five pillars with a high -level initiative, such as the 
Presidential Commission on 4iR for example, could be useful to ens ure efficient coordination of 
implementation of actions and reforms. Moreover, building on the objectives of the AU, CATFA, SADC and 
COMESA of greater economic integration, South Africa could play a leading role on the digital economy 
development across th e continent.

xii There is a growing economic and social urgency for South Africa to develop it s digital economy. Over the 
past decade, the economy has not been growing fast enough to create jobs. The unemployment rate is 
27%, inequality has increased , and ha lf of the population lives in poverty. The dualism that stems from 
the legacy of demographic and spatial exclusion in South Africa is reflected in the digital economy 
landscape, and a large share of South Africans remain disconnected from the opportunities  it has created. 
Whereas the Government of South Africa has been consistent in trying to leverage ICT for socio -economic 
development since the 1990’s, policy choices have not always been optimal, or there has been difficult y 
to implement outlined reforms a nd programs as demonstrated under many of the foundational pillars. 
The policy and regulatory uncertainty have undermined and slowed down private investment. Advances 
in digital technology present an opportunity for South Africa to reverse declines in comp etitiveness and 
service delivery  and push towards a dynamic and inclusive growing economy in line with the goals of the 
National Development Plan.  
This report uses the DE4A methodology to propose a rapid and holistic examination of the five pillars of 
the digital economy in South Africa, namely digital infrastructure, digital government platforms, digital 
financial services, digital entrepreneurship and digital skills, and is based on a series of background papers 
produced for this report. The following ar e a summary of diagnostic findings by pillar.  
KEY FINDINGS  
Digital Infrastructure  
The overall state of South Africa’s digital infrastructure is relatively robust and has enabled progressively 
better market outcomes for consumers. In the 2016 WEF Networked Readiness Index, South Africa was 
the second best performing African country and m obile download speeds are the fastest on the continent. 
In the past 10 years, it has moved to an open, competitive regime in terms of its international connectivity, 
with a good number of submarine cables connecting it to the rest of the world, resulting i n fast growth of 
international bandwidth usage.  
The Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) have played an important part in providing connectivity 
throughout the country, resulting in impressive 3G and 4G network coverage, while international 
connectivity benefi ted from away from monopoly after 2009 to an open and competitive regime. The 
Digital Economy for Africa  target of 100% of population covered by mobile broadband networks is almost 
reached. Fixed -line internet and especially fiber -optic connections to home s and businesses (FTTX) have 
experienced rapid growth in recent years, showing much promise. In international connectivity, 
competition translated resulted in 5 international submarine cables with more to come online, lower 
prices and rapid increase in int ernational bandwidth usage, which more than doubled from 2016 to 2018. 
South Africa possesses the most extensive backbone infrastructure on the continent, with around 200,000 
kms of fiber deployed, but concentrated in urban areas and with much network dupl ication.  The 
expansion of infrastructure can be largely contributed to commercial fiber operators, even though the 
state has a strong role in the sector.  South Africa also has a strong non -profit national research and 
education network, SANREN.   
However , there are concerns about the country’s performance. South Africa has experienced much policy 
uncertainty and has been slow to implement regulatory reforms, and the country is facing a major digital 
divide. Delays in spectrum assignment have limited the o perators’ ability to expand their 4G networks and 
provide faster speeds on existing networks. Most targets of the national broadband strategy, SA Connect,  
 
xiii have not been reached and the strategy needs updating. Also, whilst the urban metro regions are 
benef itting from an expansion of fiber optic cable infrastructure, preparing for the arrival of 5G networks 
and having increased consumer choice for fast internet connectivity, rural areas are being left behind. As 
extending mobile broadband coverage is becomin g a less important issue, the divide is explained more by 
affordability and characterized by quality of access. South Africa’s Quality of Service is regarded as poorer 
than in comparable countries and mobile data prices are high, especially for poorer, mor e rural 
consumers. The current regulatory and market regime is not resulting in sufficient digital inclusion, and 
the state -run programs for advancing access have not been able to fill the gap.  
Digital Public Platforms  
South Africa is one of the leaders o n digital public platforms in the region - second only to Mauritius in 
Africa - based on the 2018 UN’s e -Government Development Index (EGDI). Digital public platforms serve 
as an important enabler of digital economy allowing both public and private sector organizations to come 
up with new or better outcomes for citizens.  Citizen participation in particular is a strong point for South 
Africa. The government has adopted solid strategies in the National e -Government Strategy and Roadmap 
in November 2017 to gu ide the country’s digital transformation.  Although the activities outlined in the 
Strategy are in various stages of implementation, funding appears to be a challenge. At the sub -national 
level, progress is being made at the provincial levels, especially i n Gauteng and Western Cape, where 
much drive for government innovation happens.  
There is significant fragmentation and proliferation of institutions at the national level responsible for 
various platforms and ICT services that is hindering further developm ent.  The main institutions have 
overlapping mandates and blurred, overlapping, and sometimes undefined responsibilities. The 
institutional picture looks more cohesive at the provincial level. In terms of data protection and protection 
of ‘privacy’, South Africa has an appropriate legislative framework in place, but the ability to share data 
between Departments and Agencies is restricted. Open data policy and initiatives are still at a pilot phase, 
with benefits yet to be reaped. Capacity to use big data an alytics within the public sector is being 
developed. Key back -office systems are mostly digitized in South Africa at the national level. South Africa 
has a recently -updated national -level policy document on interoperability with SITA having a central 
contr olling role. However, legacy systems and lack of connectivity pose hurdles for implementation. No 
strong push for mainstreaming open Application Program Interfaces (APIs) within the public sector exists.  
South Africa has a strong existing national ID syste m, which is largely used for face -to-face transactions, 
but the repositioning of the Department of Home Affairs (DHA) and desire to introduce a new National 
Identity System (NIS) are an opportunity to build a world -leading digital identity system to underp in trust 
in the digital economy and boost digital trade with Africa and beyond. Coverage of South Africa’s national 
ID system is above 90 percent, which places South Africa among the highest in the world and is a great 
asset for introducing the NIS as a ne xt generation digital identity system. However, it will be important for 
the NIS to be designed as a platform and with interoperability in mind (rather than as a silo), and for the 
Government to examine options beyond a centralized system such as a federat ed model that would create 
an ecosystem of trusted public and private sector digital identity providers that would be regulated and 
supervised by Government.  
The national e -Strategy places much emphasis on digital services and encompasses several specific 
objectives linked to public service delivery and innovation both in public and private sector, including 
developing capacity and skills for effective service delivery. A National e -Government Central Portal had  
 
xiv been launched in 2018, for access to selected  online services, as a part of new e -Government roadmap; 
however, there is currently no inventory or registry of all online services maintained by DPSA or DTPS. 
Therefore, it is not immediately possible to take stock how many services have been automated a nd at 
what level.  
Digital Financial Services  
Digital financial services provide individuals and households with convenient and affordable channels by 
which to pay, as well as to save and borrow. According to the 2017 Global Findex survey, 60 percent of 
South African adults (ages 15+) reported having made or received a digital payment in the past year, well 
above Sub -Saharan Africa (SSA) average. Traditional account ownership among South Africans is also 
significantly higher than in the Sub -Saharan Africa r egion and on par with middle -income countries (MICs). 
South Africa’s large and sophisticated banking system (108 percent of GDP) offers an array of products 
and services and is investing in digitization to further expand its product offerings through incum bent 
large banks and the entry of new players.  
But South Africa’s financial services are characterized by stark dualism. The usage of debit cards (other 
than for cash withdrawal) and other electronic payment instruments remains low among low income 
househ olds with cash dominating their means of transacting. Moreover, only a fifth of adults used mobile 
phone or internet to access their accounts, substantially lagging Kenya at 72 percent. As the World Bank 
South Africa Retail Banking Diagnostic (2017) highli ghted, product design and fees on transaction accounts 
by major banks do not distinguish between low -income and high -income customers thus making these 
products costly for low -income customers. In addition, consumers may be reluctant to use internet or 
mob ile banking due to high cost, including the cost of data / airtime to access such electronic services, as 
highlighted in the financial infrastructure section of the report.  
While it is growing and gaining international recognition, South African fintech is relatively strong with 
219 companies, benefiting from good mobile phone and internet penetration. However, several key 
challenges remain. In South Africa only locally -regis tered banks may issue e -money, since issuing e -money 
is considered as deposit -taking and this has in part resulted in low usage of mobile money despite a high 
mobile phone penetration. Non -banks argue that the low percentage is due to legal framework that 
requires non -banks to offer their services jointly with a bank, which reduces profitability and flexibility in 
their product and service offering.   
At the regional level, the developments in South Africa digital financial services have strong implications , 
especially in the SADC region. South African banks have expanded extensively in Africa ; the 5 largest banks 
currently have 69 foreign subsidiaries, of which 43 are in Africa.  Importantly at SADC level, in July 2014 
the SADC financial industry launched a  wholesale cross -border payments system known as the SADC 
Integrated Regional Electronic Settlement System (SIRESS).  Participants to this system include banks and 
central banks in the region with the SARB acting as the operator and settlement agent of the  system.  The 
launching of SIRESS laid the foundation for developments in low value payment streams which are critical 
for supporting cross border remittances and promoting financial inclusion within the region. In this 
context, a low value credit transfer  scheme is being implemented to facilitate bank -to-bank transfers, 
bank -to-non-bank transfers and non -bank -to-non-bank with settlement taking place via banks. The direct 
participation of banks and non -banks in this scheme will be a positive development tha t will facilitate 
interoperability, promote competition, increase beneficiary reach and reduce cost of transacting.   
 
xv Ultimately, financial inclusion levels are expected to increase as customers get easy access through mobile 
instruments.  
Digital Entreprene urship  
South Africa is already a key digital entrepreneurship player in Africa, serving as a “hub” for many 
initiatives and investments on the continent, but its leadership is being increasingly challenged, as it is 
being held back by key policy, regulator y and human capital bottlenecks. Vibrant digital entrepreneurship 
is a key pillar of a strong digital economy, leading to new products and services, business models, markets, 
and in the end growth and jobs. A host of tech players, investors, and success st ories, along with existing 
national and provincial -level support, has set a strong foundation that is already leading to some notable 
successes, including a round of startups raising over $USD100M. The sector remains however 
overwhelmingly white, male, and  middle class. Digital talent is rare at all skill levels and becoming a critical 
bottleneck for growth of digital startups, particularly for higher -end/global skills. Issues in implementation 
and coordination of policies, coupled with limited monitoring a nd evaluation, are likely leading to a sub -
optimum allocation of resources, and South Africa is losing ground on digital entrepreneurship leadership 
to other rising continental tech hubs, including the likes of Kenya, Rwanda, Botswana, and Nigeria. Specifi c 
policies including the R&D tax incentive scheme, IP legislation, exchange controls, and labor legislation 
are also currently hindering entrepreneurial growth.  
Further strengthening of the numerous digital entrepreneurship support services provided by 
organizations and increasing access to early and growth stage finance is needed to help South African 
digital entrepreneurs scale. Sector -specific clusters are developing, e.g. around fintech, edtech, or 
agritech, some attracting substantial foreign investmen t. Most support is provided in the early stages of 
business set-up and  is highly geographically concentrated in the affluent urban areas of Gauteng and the 
Western Cape. The quality of business support services provided by many organizations is considered low, 
with few relevant mentors; digital acceleration programs are not well tailored to the South African context 
in terms of duration and are insufficiently geared for access to markets beyond South Africa. Availability 
of early and growth -stage finance fo r growth -oriented businesses has increased significantly over recent 
years, in the context of difficult access to credit for SMEs overall, but needs to be further increased to help 
high potential digital businesses grow. Supply increase has come mostly for  more mature digital 
businesses thanks to a significant tax incentive. Finance gaps persist throughout most of the lifecycle of 
digital startups, including the very early stage. Although leading the way on the African continent, most 
South African later st age funds also still lack sufficient capacity, inclusiveness, and critical size to fund and 
facilitate rapid internationalization of South African digital businesses.  
Access to both the domestic, regional and international markets continues to be difficult  for South African 
digital entrepreneurs, pleading for greater regional programs and integration. South Africa is a key entry 
point for global digital companies on the continent and an expanding digital market, and many local digital 
business models and se rvices have developed. The high cost of data does remain a challenge, and key 
players with growth and job potential, like e -commerce and other digital private platforms, face 
restrictions and costs for processing online payments. Long private and public pr ocurement cycles 
disadvantage smaller players. ICT services exports data show limited global reach, compounded by ExCon 
difficulties, while the local market remains limited compared to richer countries due to infrastructure and 
persistent inequalities.   
 
xvi Digital Skills  
South Africa’s digital skills are a key weakness for the development of a South African digital economy. 
The development of a vibrant, dynamic and inclusive digital economy requires a pool of skilled digital 
entrepreneurs to build new busine sses, and a deep labor pool to work with technology. This is an area 
that requires attention, as the South African labor market is characterized by critical skills shortages that 
are more acute in sectors such as ICT. The demand for specialized digital ski lls is rapidly increasing, with 
3,000 of the 10 most sought -after ICT jobs not filled, 25 jobs listed on the Department of Higher Education 
and Training’s (DHET) occupations in high demand are in ICT fields, and LinkedIn data showing that 10 out 
of the 11 most in demand skills are in the ICT sector. The SCD and the CPSD outline skills as the key 
mechanism through which South Africa can foster competitiveness and economic inclusion, this could not 
be truer for the ICT sector. Skills are also critical in maki ng sure that 4iR does not lead to massive job 
losses.  
Digital skills weaknesses stem from quality lags of South Africa’s education system. Even though South 
Africa is leading African countries in some aspects of digital developments, it only ranks 116th out of 140 
countries in the Global Competitiveness Report’s assessment of digital skills among the population. South 
Africa ranks at a low 126th out of 157 countries on the World Bank’s Human Capital Index, below peer 
African countries with less income. Whe n schooling is adjusted for learning, the average 18 -year -old 
would have completed 9.3 years of actual schooling, but a learning equivalent to 5.1 years, implying a 
learning gap of over 4 years. Weak outcomes in basic education in turn result in low tertia ry education 
enrollment and low graduations - including in ICT related qualifications.  
Other weaknesses in digital skills relate to governance, curriculum and resources.  While significant 
progress has been made by the DTPS to develop the iKamva National e -Skills Institute (iNeSI), conduct 
large -scale environmental scans to determine digital  skills needs, and indications of developing a digital 
skill strategy, these initiatives are still in early stages and not directly linked to the broader skills 
development work done by the DHET, NSA, or SETAs. Therefore, to date, there is a lack of identi fication 
of specific digital skills that need developing in each of the levels of digital skills. Digital skills development 
in schools also still has a long way to go. Many schools are still without devices and connectivity, many do 
not offer ICT -related subjects, and there are concerns about teacher training in effective technology use. 
All of this hinders digital literacy . With regards to professional digital skills, the production of post -school 
graduates does not meet labor market demands and curricula  are not responding fast enough to meet 
rapid changes in demand. The development of professional digital skills is also impaired by a lack of 
coherent, national leadership and collaboration, which leads to lack of coherence in institutional offerings. 
And finally, only some universities are recognizing the link between entrepreneurship, business, and ICT 
skills which hinders e -business skills

 1. INTRODUCTION  
 
 
South Africa is one of the digital economy leaders on the African continent,  but lags developed countries. 
With a population of 57.7 million people, a GDP of over USD 350 billion and a PPP -adjusted average 
income of USD 13,000, South Africa is among the fe w countries in the region with upper -middle income 
status. The ICT sector contributes around about 17 percent of service exports and close to 3 percent of 
GDP.3 With internet usage of more than 54 percent in 2017, South Af rica is among the leaders in Afri ca4  
but lags behind many developed economies and other middle -income countries (MIC). Smartphone 
penetration rates are also relatively high, with more than 80 percent of the population owning a 
smartphone. Moreover, the country is ranked of 46th out of 1 40 countries for innovation capability by 
the World Economic Forum (WEF) Global Competitiveness Report.  
In this context, the Digital Economy for Africa targets  appear within reach for South Africa, although 
efforts need to be maintained. Launched in 2018 t hrough a collaboration between the African Union (AU) 
and the World Bank, the Digital Economy for Africa  Initiative aims to ensure that every individual, business 
and government in Africa will be digitally enabled by 2030 . With strong fundamentals such as a relatively 
strong manufacturing base, a critical mass of private sector firms, deep and diversified financial and capital 
markets, competence in research & development, several internationally recognized universities, and 
wide coverage of mobile broadban d, it is estimated that over the next decade, more than ZAR 5 trillion in 
value could be created in South Africa through the use of digital technologies in key industry sectors, 
including agriculture, public infrastructure and administration, financial ser vices and manufacturing.5 
South Africa could also play a leading role for regional digital development, particularly within the context 
of the recently signed Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA) agreement, as well close r to home in the 
Southern Africa Deve lopment Community (SADC)  and Common Market fo r Eastern and Southern Africa 
(COMESA ) context, following on the East Africa Single Digital Market as an example. This could be all the 
more important given that the World Bank’s Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) identified limited 
integration into global value chains as one of the major con straints to growth in South Africa. Closer 
cooperation between the region’s countries would also help in creating more value out of public and 
private infrastructure investments such as fiber -optic backbone networks and data centers . South Africa 
could ass ist by leading the agenda to harmonize customs, disseminating best practices to other countries 
around issues such as data regulation, improvement in the ecommerce environment, promotion of Africa -
wide payment systems and the provision of an even stronger regional hub for tech entrepreneurs.  
In this context, the South African government is aiming  to pass several  reforms across core elements of 
the digital economy, recognizing the need for new policy directions and preparing for the 4iR. In its 
Industrial Po licy Action Plan, the government of South Africa identified ICT as among 12 priority sectors 
that can grow and create jobs. In 2016, the National Integrated ICT Policy White Paper defined the 
overarching ICT policy framework. One important action taken in 2018 was to initiate the merger of the 
Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services (DTPS) and the Department of Communications 
(DoC) to improve the overall institutional framework to promote faster decision making and clarifying

 2 mandates, which ha s been confirmed in the latest government nominations. In September 2019, South 
Africa will join the WEF Centre for the 4iR Network (C4IR Network) alongside China, India and Japan.6 In 
March 2019, the Presidential Commission on the 4IR was  announced.7 The commission is chaired by 
President Cyril Ramaphosa and aims to identify relevant policies, strategies and action plans that will 
position South Africa as a competitive global player.8  
Yet more efforts are needed to tackle entrenched socio -economic exc lusion, which has resulted in  
keeping household income at low -levels and preventing MSMEs from fully participating in opportunities 
offered by the digital economy.  At 0.63, the Gini coefficient measuring income dispersion in South Africa 
is among the hig hest in the world, and around half of the population live in poverty.9 While South Africa’s 
wealthy households have broad access to quality and relatively affordable internet, people earning less 
than ZAR 7000 a month are largely unconnected.10 This repor t reviews how the digital divide affects the 
foundations of the digital economy and provides policy options for bridging the divide.  
Furthermore, while South Africa is a regional success story of attracting private investment into digital 
economy, since 20 09 FDI into the digital economy has been falling.11  Significant investments in fiber -optic 
networks made over the past decades have endowed South Africa the most extensive backbone 
infrastructure in Africa12, while investment from MNOs have enabled almost universal coverage of mobile 
broadband networks. But since 2010, the regulatory, policy and business environment has been less 
conducive to private investment. Regarding digital infrastructure specifically, notable constraints to 
private investment in digital infrastructure include delays in allocating high demand spectrum and policy 
uncertainty around the Wireless Open Access Network (WOAN) . Moreover, based on the findings, in 
specific areas such as broadban d roll -out or government service digitalization, the government appears 
to rely excessively on its own resources and capacities, at times leading to inefficient, expensive and 
incomplete project implementation. Overall, there is room to consider leveraging  more private 
investment and expertise in key areas such as infrastructure deployment, skills development and the roll -
out of e -government platforms. This is especially pertinent in the context of the South African 
Government’s commitment to fiscal consoli dation. 13  
Moreover, South Africa’s private sector has been slow to adopt digitization, particularly in the 
manufacturing sector where competitiveness has been declining. None of the South African 
manufacturing companies surveyed in PWC’s Digital Champion s report are frontrunners in digitalization 
 
6 The WEF established the C4iR in San Francisco, USA in March 2017 as a hub for global, multi -stakeholder cooperation to develop policy 
frameworks and advance collaborations that acc elerate the benefits of science and technology. The South African government, through the 
Department of Science and Technology (DST), intends to establish a WEF Affiliate Centre as a public -private partnership based at the Council for 
Scientific and Indust rial Research (CSIR).

8 In 2018, Telkom and several universities established the 4IR South Africa partnership with the objective of stimulating and f acilitating an 
inclusive national dialogue to shape a coherent national response to the 4IR. The partnership also aims to complemen t and support other 
national activities relating to 4iR - most notably the recently appointed Presidential Commission on 4IR.

 3 of operations.14 In fact, most fall into the “digital novice” category - which represents the least digitally 
mature companies. These firms are missing out on cost -saving, productivity gains and revenue growth. 
The competitive gap between dynamic economies such as in the Asia Pacific region (which are digitalizing  
much more quickly) will thus continue to widen unless action is taken15. In other segments such as e -
commerce where South Africa lags - 1.4 percent of t otal sales compared to the global average of 11.5 
percent -, barriers could be coming from the demand side including issues such as lack of trust and 
consumer culture .  
Accelerated development of the digital economy is critical to unlock economy -wide invest ment, create 
much needed jobs, and help reverse the productivity decline in South Africa. The recent Country Private 
Sector Diagnostic (CPSD) identifies the ICT sector as one of the sectors where short - to medium -term 
reforms, notably aimed at addressing t he digital divide, would unlock private investment and create 
jobs16. Even in a context of heightened economic and policy uncertainty, the ICT industry has 
demonstrated resilience in job creation, with employment in the telecommunications sector alone 
grow ing by 6.2 percent over the last five years17; LinkedIn data shows that 10 out of the 11 most in demand 
jobs in South Africa are in the ICT sector. Moreover, empirical estimations from the Future of Work study 
show that faster internet adoption improves th e prospects of finding a skilled job without reducing the 
prospects of finding an unskilled.18 More generally, in a context where 6.2 million South Africans are 
actively looking for jobs but cannot find them19, putting in place technologies to better adver tise vacancies 
and help people start their own companies by lowering barriers to entry and improving access to markets 
relative to other industries would go a long way toward improving job market prospects.  
The consequences of inaction are high, and South Africa is also already experiencing an exodus of skills 
that could dampen its digital economy ambitions. LinkedIn data tracking cross -country movements of 
professionals across industries indicate that computer software has one of the highest rates of migra tion 
out of the country, and that half of the skills lost to migration out of South Africa are in the ICT sector  and 
are concentrated in skills that are critical for the 4iR.  While such migration can also be seen in other MICs, 
it is happening at a faste r pace in South Africa.  It also takes place in a context where ICT skills are already 
scarce, immigration requirements are cumbersome, and skilled workers command a skills premium20. As 
ICT is an industry with high skills intensity, these developments act  as a drag on cost competitiveness and 
lessens the interest of investors that would like to anchor their ICT operations in South Africa to serve a 
pan-African market.  
The remainder of this report will provide a diagnostic and offer recommendations on the five foundations 
of the digital economy in South Africa. The report will examine, in turn, challenges concerning digital

 5 2. DIGITAL  INFRASTRUCTURE   
 
2.1. BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE OF DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE  
Fast, high -quality and affordable broadband internet is a key foundation of the digital economy. Increased 
connectivity affects economic growth, productivity, firm performance and efficiency and quality of public 
institutions and services in a positive way21. The effect of increased broadband access on economic growt h 
and employment has been well documented22. By enabling improved access to information governments 
can be made more accountable to citizens, and citizens connected to opportunities for learning and 
employment.  
For this report, digital infrastructure is a nalyzed in four parts: (1) the first mile (South Africa’s international 
connectivity), (2) the middle mile (national backbone and long -distance networks), (3) the last mile (access 
networks connecting the end -user) and (4) the invisible mile (policies and regulations promoting or 
hindering broadband access). Special attention will be paid to the market for both fixed -line and mobile 
broadband services in different parts of the broadband value chain.  
In the Networked Readiness Index of the WEF Global Informa tion Technology Report from 2016 South 
Africa performed well and rose to the position of 65th as the second best performing African country. 
Gains were made especially by businesses, and improvements were evident in infrastructure and 
affordability. Based on data from Ookla23, South Africa comes first in Africa on mobile internet download 
speeds. Commercial cloud providers such as AWS and Huawei have entered the market with big growth 
prospects24. 
However, South Africa has slipped in the ITU’s ICT Developme nt Index from position 78 to 92 between 
2002 and 2018 trailing behind emerging market competitors such as Brazil, Mexico, Turkey and India, 
much due to lack of progress on infrastructure. It’s performance on fixed broadband speeds is not as 
favorable as mo bile, ranking at position 102 globally, behind several other African countries. South Africa 
suffers from a persistent digital divide, with almost half the country still not using the internet. The urban 
metro regions are enjoying an expansion of fiber opt ic cable infrastructure, preparing for the arrival of 5G 
networks and benefiting from increased consumer choice for fast internet connectivity, but rural South 
Africa is being left behind . Multi -faceted problems around affordability, lack of internet -enabl ed devices, 
limited demand and poor skills hinder progress towards universal access25. 
The South African policy and regulatory environment has sound legal and institutional foundations, 
although it has suffered from much uncertainty in recent years. There has been a lack of clear policy 
direction in key questions such as wireless spectrum allocation  and licensing  and difficulties in 
implementing agreed regulatory reforms. The ability of the Independent Communications Authority of

 6 South Africa (ICASA) to eff ectively regulate the digital communications sector26 has been questioned. 
Several experts interviewed for this report stated that the regulator’s independence and capacity have 
weakened over the past few years. This has caused some key processes such as spectrum  licensing  to be 
seriously delayed27. There are signs of a turnaround strategy. President Ramaphosa in 2018 announced 
that his government will work to implement reforms and fast -track delayed spectrum assig nment . These 
efforts are also being coordin ated under the new Presidential Commission on the 4th Industrial Revolution 
(4IR)28, which will focus on digital infrastructure as one of its themes.  
Despite a dedicated Universal Service and Access Agency (USAASA) managing The Universal Service and 
Access  Fund (USAF), the growing demand for services has largely been met by operators on commercial 
terms. Over the lifespan of the USAF, only some ZAR 620 million had been allocated to projects under the 
USAF by the Treasury and the role of USAASA in promoting internet access in South A frica has been 
marginal. The USAF is currently being consolidated into a new Digital Development Fund (DDF) with a 
broader mandate, possibly repurposed to contribute better to the SA Connect’s objectives  and to promote 
innovation in the digital sector . Thi s is a step that most stakeholders welcome.  
The National Integrated ICT Policy White Paper (2016) by the Department of Telecommunications and 
Postal Services set out key objectives for developing the ICT sector in South Africa. The White Paper 
addressed is sues such as establishing cross -government leadership in ICT, promoting innovation and 
competition, strengthening regulation, addressing the digital divide and ensuring affordable access. It 
extended and reinforced existing strategies including the nationa l broadband strategy South Africa 
Connect (SA Connect)29 and the National Cybersecurity Policy Framework30.  
The South Africa Connect (SA Connect) broadband policy  from 2013 set ambitious targets for improving 
internet access and connecting government faci lities. It aimed to extend a minimum of 5Mbps broadband 
access to 90% of the population and 100Mbps to 50% of the population by 2020. The long -term target for 
2030 was set at 100% of the population connected at 10Mbps and 80% at 100Mbps. In addition to the se, 
several institutional targets were set, aiming at connecting all government facilities by 2020 at speeds 
ranging from 10Mbps to 100Mbps. The implementation of SA Connect has been delegated to three 
publicly owned entities: Broadband Infraco (BBI), Stat e Information Technology Agency (SITA) and 
Sentech  with downstream participation by other private operators. Progress has been slower and costlier 
than expected and South Africa is not on track to meet the 2020 targets for connected facilities or internet 
access, although the intermediary target of 50% internet access by 2016 has been achieved somewhere 
in 2017. Phase 2 of SA Connect is currently on hold, pending a feasibility study.  
 
 
 
26 The sector is also subject to regulation by the Competition Commission of South Africa. In some areas, ICASA and the Competition Commission 
have overlapping powers and mandates.  
27 For example, the planned spectrum auction that ICASA was planning to proceed with in 2016 was contested by the DTPS and final ly cancelle d 
by a High Court verdict.

2.2. DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS : CURRENT STATE OF DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE  
2.2.1.  Analysis of the Broadband Market  
Based on ITU statistics, 54% of South Africans were using the internet regularly in 2017, comparing 
favorably with countries such as Kenya, Nigeria and Mauritius, but lagging well beh ind world leaders such 
as Korea (Table 1). Mobile remains the primary means for people to get online in South Africa31. Overall 
wireless penetration in 2017 was at 162% with 5% growth from the year before. According to ICASA32, 
mobile cellular data subscri ptions increased from 61.4 million in 2017 to 65.8 million in 2018 and 
smartphone penetration has risen to 81.7% with rapid growth from 2016. 9 out of 10 mobile broadband 
subscriptions are pre -paid33. During the same year, fixed -line subscriptions increase d by 147%, all implying 
good growth in internet access for 2018. It will nevertheless be highly unlikely that South Africa meets the 
SA Connect target of 90% penetration by 2020 based on the current trajectory.  
Currently, there are four main MNOs operating  in South Africa, the three largest of which jointly hold 
overall revenue market share  of 95.3%34: Vodacom (49.8%), MTN (33.5%) and Cell -C (12%). Telkom, a 
company in which the government has a major stake is the fourth player. The latest entrant is the data -
only operator Rain, which so far has a modest market share, but the most affordable data offer ing. Voice 
 
31 57% of South African household’s internet use in 2017 took place using mobile devices, highlighting  the role that mobile connectivity plays.

 8 revenues have been falling as data services and OTTs have gained ground. Over the past three years, 
mobile data use has grown rapidly, between 55% to 68% annually.  
Figure 4: Reported mobile subscriber market shares in 201835

In addition to infrastructure -based operators, South Africa has a growing number of Mobile Virtual 
Network Operators ( MVNO) which were permitted in 2005. Altogether they hold around 2% share of 
mobile users, translating to around 1.8 million subscribers36. The MVNO market has attracted entrants 
from companies in other sectors such as retail, banking and consumer goods.  
The fixed -line market in South Africa has recently received a boost, after years of being held back by an 
expensive operating environment.  Market growth has been restricted to urban environments but has 
been impressive over the past years (growing to almost 7.5 million of xDSL and FTTX connections in 2018.37 
The role of Telkom is still significant, and it is the market leader with around 14%  market share. The rest 
of the market is shared between many ISPs. In fixed -line broadband access, South Africa is currently 
making gains that have broader significance in Africa, where the fixed -line market is generally in its 
infancy.

 10 Whereas network coverage gaps in South Africa are closing, the digital divide is increasingly characterized 
by unaffordability of internet use39. In 201940, the Competition Commission of South Africa in 2019 found 
that the current data prices a re excessively high, noting that existing competition in the sector has not 
been sufficient to push prices down. Based on Research ICT Africa’s41 Mobile Pricing Index Portal the 
cheapest mobile 1GB data product on the market in Q3/201 9 cost US$ 6.81 , compa red with Kenya’s US$ 
2.44, Nigeria’s US$ 2.7 8 and Mauritius’s US$ 5. 16, suggesting much room for improvement. On the other 
hand, based on ITU data from 2017 (Table 1), South Africa’s mobile broadband data appear relatively 
affordable at 1GB mobile broadband data costing 1.2 percent of Gross National Income Per Capita 
(GNIPC), well below the UN Broadband Commission target of 2%. Based on this measure, South Africa 
performs well against Kenya and Nigeria, but is far more expensive than Mauritius. Also , ICASA in 2018 
found that South Africa’s data costs fall in the mid -range of SADC and BRICS comparator countries.  The 
final findings of the Competition Commission’s Data Market Inquiry 42 from December 2019 provide at 
least a partial way forward in terms o f lowering consumer prices , as it mandated both MTN and Vodacom 
to reach agreements with the Competition Commission on significant price cuts.  
Using data from the Statistics South Africa’s Living Conditions Survey 2014/2015, and the ITU prices for 
1GB of mobile broadband data from 2018 , the bottom 20 percent of South Africa’s  population would 
have to spend around 12 percent of their income per capita for 1GB of mobile data (Figure 6), a figure 
much higher than the ITU average. Geographical analysis shows that South Africans living in rural and 
informal areas face substantially  higher data prices as a percentage of their income per capita, as do 
demographic groups of blacks and women, in which poverty levels are higher. Results from a 2017 Survey 
by Research ICT Africa43  point out to a 36 percent gap between rural and urban int ernet use in South  
 
 
39 Based on the RIA survey from 2017, the majority of those not connected to the  internet belong to the lowest two income quartiles (earning 
less than ZAR 7167 per month) and are disproportionately located in rural areas

 11 Africa, which may at least partially be explained by unaffordability of use. There are structural issues with 
pricing that work against poorer consumers: postpaid data is cheaper than prepaid, and people with less 
disposable income also end up buying small er data bundles, which are costlier than large ones.  
2.2.2.  First Mile: South Africa’s International Connectivity  
For a long time, international connectivity formed a major bottleneck in South Africa. Until 2009, Telkom 
enjoyed monopoly on the submarine cables c onnecting South Africa to the rest of the world and input 
prices for local internet service providers (ISPs) were high. Today, there are five submarine cable systems 
landing on both East and West coasts of South Africa with more planned to come online in t he next years44. 
Together with an open and competitive international connectivity market this has resulted in significant 
reductions in bandwidth prices45. Based on ICASA operator surveys, the total used international internet 
bandwidth increased by 61.7% from 2016 to 2017 and by 41.6% from 2017 to 2018 and was around 0.87 
Tbps in 201846. South Africa has open international gateways to all its neighboring countries.  
Figure 8: Growth in international internet bandwidth (Mbps per second) 47
 
2.2.3.  Middle Mile: National Backbone Infrastructure  
South Africa has the most extensive backbone infrastructure on the African continent. The market has 
been liberalized since 2005 and has seen an expansion of infrastructure providers since. Overall,  South 
Africa is estimated to have around 200.000km of fiber deployed of which a little over 100.000km in long -
distance transmission48. By far the largest network is owned by Telkom’s Openserve wholesale subsidiary 
(over 150.000km in total of which 75.000k m long -distance, passing around 300.000 homes). BBI has a 
network of about 15.000km of fiber and provides managed bandwidth to its customers. Main dark fiber 
providers include Dark Fibre Africa and Vumatel, estimated to have 20.000km of fiber deployed. Fib reco 
operates around 4000km and Liquid Telecom 3000km of fiber, covering main cities and towns across the 
 
44 The existing cable systems include: SEACOM, EASSy, West African Cable System  (WACS), Africa Coast to Europe (ACE), SAT -3/WASC/SAFE. 
Planned include: SABR, SAEx, IOX Cable System, Africa -1, and METISS  
45According to Telegeography market data, the price of a 100 Gbps IRU between Johannesburg and London has come down from US$87 millio n 
to around US$3,97 million between 2013 and 2018  
46Telegeography estimates are much higher than the ICASA statistics, pointing to 3.39 Tbps in Q4 of 2018.

 12 country. Main MNOs have their own long -distance transmission networks and municipal fiber networks 
exist in some towns and cities.  
SANREN is South Afr ica’s national research and education network connecting academic institutions and 
campuses49. It is operated by The Tertiary Education and Research Network of South Africa (TENET) on a 
non-profit basis under a collaboration agreement with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research 
(CSIR) . The network is specifically important for running big science projects at universities and research 
institutions. For example, it provides national and international connectivity for the flagship Square 
Kilometer Array (SKA) project.  
Overall, the fiber -optic backbone infrastructure has grown increasingly robust, albeit concentrated in 
more urban areas. Already in 2013, it was estimated that 86% of SA population in 2013 resided within 
10km of fiber, after which deployments have expanded significantly. There are six active Internet 
Exchange Points (IXPs) in the three biggest metro areas of Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban, the 
largest IXP in Africa ranking within the top 15 globally50.The main challenges with the middle mile are 
related to duplication of infrastructure and rural reach. The government has a strong presence on the 
market through its ownership in Telkom and the fully state -owned BBI51. As the market has showed it is 
capable to deploy infrastructure to largely meet South Africa’s growing needs, privatization of 
government -owned assets combined w ith stronger regulation of the wholesale market could be 
considered.  
2.2.4.  Last Mile: Reaching the End -Users  
In South Africa, Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) have played an important part in providing 
connectivity throughout the country. The last mile in South A frica is mostly built, operated and dominated 
by the four main MNOs: Vodacom South Africa, MTN South Africa, Cell C and Telkom Mobile. In addition, 
South Africa has a recent market entry of the data -only operator Rain and a growing number of MVNOs. 
Based o n latest ICASA data, mobile broadband network coverage was 99. 5% population coverage for 3G 
and 85.7% for 4G in 2018, the latter going up significantly since 2017 (Figure 9) and compared to ITU data 
from 2017 (Table 1).  The Digital Economy for Africa Init iative’s  target of 100% mobile broadband coverage 
by 2030 is virtually reached.

 13 Figure 9: National population coverage  for 3G and 4G  
 
Quality of Service (QoS) in South Africa is regarded as poorer than in many other comparable countries52 
and network performance can vary greatly across the covered areas. Delays in spectrum auction have 
limited the operators’ ability to expand their 4G networks and provide faster speeds on existing networks. 
Spectrum allocations per op erator are considerably low by international comparisons. South Africa is first 
in Africa for average mobile download speeds, but performance varies in different provinces, with speeds 
in the fastest province (Free State) was 38.7% faster than that in the slowest (Northern Cape)53 
There is an estimated 28 000 cellphone towers in South Africa as of mid -201854. Although the majority of 
these are owned by the two biggest MNO’s Vodacom and MTN, they are also built and operated by 
independent Towercos or in -house tower business units like in the case of Telkom’s Gyro Towers. 
Altogether there are 11 independent Tow ercos on the market, owning around 1/3 of South Africa’s tower 
infrastructure. The passive infrastructure market is expected to grow as operators divest from their own 
tower infrastructure.  
Fixed -line internet and especially fiber -optic connections to home s and businesses (FTTX) have 
experienced rapid growth in recent years ( Figure 3 ) on the back of the expanded long -distance and metro 
area open access fiber infrastructure. This has led to duplication of infrastructure in metro areas, but on 
the other hand has promoted competition and opened opportunities for smaller ISPs. The higher speeds 
and reliability that DSL and FTTX connections provide are important for the growth of the digital service 
market. There are signs emerging of operators looking to expand affordable fiber connections also to 
lower income township markets55.  
In addition, South Africa has several commercial operators and non -profits utilizing unlicensed spectrum 
for providing community -level local internet connectivity. South Africa is the o nly country in the region to 
 
52 Alternative fiber -optic infrastructure is owned and developed by both Eskom (South Africa’s public electricity utility) and Transnet (Public 
operator of ports, railways and pipelines). BBI enjoys exclusive servitude access to these assets.

 14 have published TV whitespace regulations56, but progress on exploiting the frequencies commercially has 
been slow.  
2.2.5.  Invisible Mile: Key Policy and Regulatory Issues  
The Government has viewed the current regime of infrastructure competition among MNOs as ineffective, 
arguing it has resulted in high prices, much infrastructure duplication and an urban bias.  Driving down 
data prices through stronger regulation and more competition has become a political priority57, but also 
a regul atory problem, reflected in the Competition Commission’s inquiry into the data markets and 
ICASA’s parallel mobile market review.  The proposed Electronic Communications Act (ECA) Amendment 
Bill of 2018 was designed, among others, to give smaller MNOs bett er means of accessing high -demand 
spectrum, encourage more service -based competition and lower data prices. The Bill was withdrawn in 
early 2019 and its re -introduction and adoption of the legislation has been postponed . 
One of the key proposals in the Ame ndment Bill was to establish a Wireless Open Access Network (WOAN) 
operator in the wholesale market. Through the WOAN, The Government’s objective was to promote more 
efficient spectrum use and service -based competition for achieving more affordable rates f or consumers. 
The model has experienced much opposition from the market, especially from most of the existing MNOs. 
The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in a study58  commissioned by the DTPS confirmed 
the model’s feasibility in terms of available spectrum, recommending that 20% of the available high -
demand spectrum be assigned to the WOAN. It also noted the need to carry out a proper market study 
on the model, which to date has not been done. The Competition Commission  in its prelimina ry findings59 
concluded  that the model could increase market competition if correctly structured: it needs to be an 
effective competitor in the wholesale market instead of a monopoly in any part of it, and requiring vertical 
separation if operated by an ex isting MNO.  
Despite repeated calls for releasing more high -demand spectrum for 4G  use, the process has been subject 
to substantial delays. The slow progress has created much concern in the market, restricting the operators 
ability to expand and upgrade th eir existing networks  and to prepare for the introduction of next 
generation 5G networks.  Even though 5G will likely not play a major role in advancing rural access and 
quality of service, it will play a major part in promoting South Africa’s international competitiveness, 
ensuring continued private investment in the sector and promoting innovation in the digital economy. 
Through a Policy Direction issued on July 26 2019 60, the DTPS mandated ICASA to proceed with the WOAN 
licensing process as w ell as assignment of high -demand spectrum to other operators.  This has been widely 
regarded as a positive step.  After the withdrawal of the ECA Bill, th e licensing  process will be carried out 
under the existing licensing regime, guided by the ICT White Pa per of 2016 and the Policy Direction. ICASA 
issued an information memorandum on the licensing process in November 2019 61 and plans to issue an 
Invitation to Apply (ITA) in 2020. Constraints  still remain : the available spectrum is fragmented , and some

rates for data when their data has run out without consumers’ prior consent.

 15 of the identified spectrum in the 700Mhz and 800Mhz bands is still occupied   due to the unfinished digital 
migration process.  
Whereas market players interviewed for this study did not raise any major problems related to the current 
infrastructure sh aring regime, some challenges remain. All licensees are required to provide access to 
facilities on negotiated terms (except if technically and financially unreasonable), but in practice 
incumbents have often refused access. There are also complaints that gaining permissions from local 
governments and utilities to deploy broadband infrastructure is expensive and complex. The Amendment 
Bill was to introduce stronger enforcement around infrastructure sharing, moving to impose ex -ante 
sharing obligations to ve rtically integrated operators. It also aimed at establishing a national center to 
support rapid deployment and necessary permits. Stronger regulation on infrastructure sharing could 
present an alternative to the WOAN through lowering barriers of entry to t he market.  
South African cybersecurity, data protection and privacy policies have been proactive compared with 
many African peers. The Protection of Personal Information Act of 2013 (POPIA) is well in line with 
international standards and the Constitution of South Africa provides for strong privacy protection. The 
National Cybersecurity Policy Framework passed in March 2015 focuses on improving institutional 
coordination, cybersecurity functions, infrastructure and information flows across sectors. In organ izing 
for cybersecurity response, South Africa has employed a distributed model, where the national 
Cybersecurity Response Committee (CRC) and the Cybersecurity Hub coordinate several sectoral 
Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs). There has b een some legal progress, but 
implementation of the framework has not been as fast as hoped.  
2.3. RECOMMENDATIONS & NEXT STEPS 
The overall state of South Africa’s digital infrastructure is relatively robust and has enabled progressively 
better market outcomes for consumers. The challenges have moved from expanding network coverage 
to ensuring access and affordability through regulating an increasingly populated and complex market. 
Going ahead, South African policies should aim at universal internet acc ess, ensure competitive 
broadband markets, alleviate concerns around mobile spectrum capacity, improve network performance, 
promote rural connectivity and stimulate fixed -line adoption.  
South Africa needs an updated national broadband policy with realistic  targets and implementation 
models based on international best practice. It should aim for universal fast internet access during the 
next decade in line with the Digital Economy for Africa Initiative.  Instead of continuing to rely on SOEs, 
grant or guarant ee mechanisms to subsidy private sector investment could be considered to incentivize 
infrastructure roll -out. The Government should also use its anchor position on the market more 
proactively to stimulate competition, through aggregating its demand for co nnectivity and have this 
delivered on a competitive basis. These measures would help attract more private interest into 
underserved  areas.  
Ensuring ICASA’s independence and capacity under the new merged national department is key. The 
regulator needs clear  mandate confirming its field of play, to help alleviate concerns around its 
independence and expedite stalled actions such as spectrum licensing. The regulator should also have  
 16 sufficient  budget resources. The ECA Amendment Bill’s proposal for enhancing coordination between 
ICASA and the Competition Commission appears sound.  
The government should prioritize fast -tracking spectrum assignment , to increase network capacity and 
alleviate const raint that the operators currently face and to take a proactive stance towards next 
generation  5G networks , to promote South Africa’s international competitiveness. The DTPS Policy 
Direction  and the ICASA Information Memorandum in 2019 have been good step s towards this direction. 
Allowing sharing of spectrum as part of the licensing process , and trading of high demand spectrum if 
there is no detrimental impact on competition  could be considered . 
In the WOAN licensing process there needs to be careful consid eration of the model to avoid monopolistic 
outcomes in the wholesale market, maximize private investment and ensure continued incentives to 
innovate. Although there is room for improvement in mobile competition, it is not clear that the WOAN 
would solve is sues around market competition in the short term.  
South Africa should make efforts to encourage further positive developments in the fixed -line broadband 
market. Promotion of infrastructure sharing, pro -competition open access principles, implementation o f 
transparent wholesale pricing  and determination of regulatory remedies could help the market grow. A 
possible market enquiry into the wholesale market by ICASA could be beneficial to guide these steps . 
Ensuring effective access to civil infrastructure su ch as ducts and poles held by incumbents can have 
significant potential for promoting competition and further investment in South Africa. Stronger 
enforcement of the country’s existing infrastructure regime and new rules around infrastructure sharing 
might  also be needed to lower costs for new entrants, backed up by more coordination for rapid 
deployment as proposed by the ECA Amendment Bill.   
The USAF of South Africa currently administered by USAASA (and to be integrated into the DDF) should 
be redesigned  to better promote expan sion broadband access in the country  and innovation in the digital 
sector.  Incentives for de -risking private sector investments in rural areas and accelerating deployment of 
high -speed fiber in peri -urban areas could be part of the mix, as could be demand -side schemes for 
subsidizing low -income consumers’ communication costs as a more economic option to supply side 
subsidies. Innovative use of unlicensed spectrum (Wi -Fi, TV whitespace) could be further supported.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 17 3. PUBLIC DIGITAL PLATFORMS  
 
3.1. BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC SECTOR DIGITAL PLATFORMS  
Digital public platforms serve as an important enabler of digital economy that allows both public and 
private sector organizations to come up with new or better outcomes for citizens.  The discussion of digital 
public platforms is often equated with the development of e -government or digital government.  While 
the level of digitalization of government is an important reflection of the state of the development of the 
digita l public sector platforms, the core platform components are more foundational.  First, they include 
facilitation of secure transactions between people and institutions  – through digital ID systems and trust 
services. Second, it is the facilitation of data exchanges leveraging common resources  – through 
interoperability and shared services; and finally, the interface through which governments engage with 
the public  – through digital service delivery and applications of core government functions.  This chapte r 
discusses the current state of these core components of digital public platforms in South Africa and 
provides recommendations for their further development.  
South Africa is one of the leaders in the region - second only to Mauritius in Africa - based on the UN’s 
2018 e -Government Development Index (EGDI) (Figure 10). Only four African countries (Mauritius, South 
Africa, Tunisia and Seychelles) are in the top fiftieth percentile along with countries that have EGDIs above 
the world average of 0.549. South Africa’s EGDI is 0.66 (ranked 68th out of 193) with a high online  service 
index (0.83) and human capital index (0.73), and a lagging telecommunication infrastructure index (0.42). 
On the other hand, citizen participation index (0.85) is very strong, where South Africa is ranked 39th in 
the world.  
Figure 10: EGDI overview of South Africa62

The government adopted the National e -Government Strategy and Roadmap in November 2017 to guide 
the country’s digital transformation.  The Strategy identifies three e -Government strategic thrusts: (1) e -
Government Services Transformation: Standardized national e -services portal; (2) Enhanced e -
Governance: Shared platforms, open government, improved governance; (3) Digitally -enabled Society:  
Digital l iteracy for citizens, service centers.  
 
62 https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/en -us/Reports/UN -E-Government -Survey -2018  
 
 18 Although the activities outlined in the Strategy are in various stages of implementation, the funding 
appears to be a challenge. This shortcoming requires urgent attention so as not to lose the momentum, 
at the onset of important initiatives planned for 2019.  As important as the scarcity of funding is the 
shortage of human capacity for implementation.  This concerns both the stock of skilled IT professionals 
as well as the need for constant updating of their skills.   
Given the above context, this chapter examines the building blocks for public sector digital platforms to 
uncover enabling conditions and bottlenecks for the further development of the platforms. These building 
blocks include: (i) institutional setup for digital government development and management; (ii) data policy 
and frameworks; (iii)  interoperability, back -office systems, and shared systems; (iv) digital ID; and (v) 
digital service delivery.  
These building blocks are tightly interconnected.  Instituti onal setup and leadership underpin the 
coordination of digital government initiatives.  This, in turn, depends on the legal and behavioral norms 
regarding sharing the data among the Departments and Agencies and the public at large.  Coordination 
and data e xchange further enable or hinder the creation and operating of the shared systems, as well as 
ensuring the interoperability among the systems of Departments and Agencies. Creation of shared 
systems and ensuring interoperability also depends on how much of the government back -office 
operations are digitized in the first place. At the interface with the public, the digital ID services are crucial 
to ensure trust and facilitate secure transactions. Finally, all of these issues impact the ability of the 
governm ent to provide digital services to its citizens.  
Because of the government structure in South Africa, the assessment at the national level can only paint 
a partial picture of the state of the government digital platforms.  Because many of the key services  are 
provided at the provincial level, much drive for the government digital innovation happens there.  
Although a full subnational analysis was beyond the scope of this rapid assessment, the discussions with 
the national -level institutions were supplement ed by a selective examination of the public sector digital 
platforms in two provinces: Gauteng and Western Cape. There is a consensus that these two provinces 
are generally at the forefront of developing digital government solutions in South Africa and thu s capture 
the biggest advances at the provincial level.  
3.2. DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS : CURRENT STATE OF PUBLIC DIGITAL  PLATFORMS   
3.2.1.  Institutional setup for e -government development  
There is a great fragmentation and proliferation of institutions at the national level responsible for various 
platforms and ICT services.  The main institutional players include the following:  
● Department of Public Service Administration (DPSA).  The overall responsibility for public sector 
innovation is vested in the Minister  for the DPSA.  It includes the Center for Public Sector 
Innovation (CPSI), whose mandate is to “to entrench the culture and practice of innovation in the 
public sector in its entirety.”  
● Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services (DTPS). The above -mentioned National 
eGovernment Strategy was developed by the DTPS. The DTPS was founded in 2014 to focus on 
“modernizing the economy and economic infrastructure to bring the cost down through the roll - 
 19 out of Broadband, e -Government, Cybersecurity, Po stal, and Postbank services.”  The DTPS is 
expected to be the facilitator and catalyst for the implementation of the Strategy.  
● Department of Science and Technology (DST). DST, along with DTPS and DPSA, is responsible for 
some parts of the strategy dimensio n, including producing innovation strategies (somewhat 
overlapping with those produced by DTPS and DPSA) and ICT Roadmap.  
● Department of Home Affairs (DHA).  DHA manages the Government’s Home Affairs National 
Identity System (HANIS), which is being upgraded  transformed into the National Identity System 
(NIS) as a digital identity system to facilitate electronic transactions online, among other 
improvements.  
● State Information Technology Agency (SITA). SITA, originally formed within DPSA, was detached 
from DPS A and attached to DTPS for the procurement of IT services, standard setting and products 
authentication, security of government data, and provision of e -government services. SITA is 
expected to work together with DTPS and DPSA in providing project manageme nt and other 
support to all e -Government projects for the delivery of government services especially at 
national and provincial levels.  
● The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) and the Government Information 
Technology Officer’s Counc il (GITOC). OGCIO and GITOC were established by regulations that 
came into effect in 2003 under the umbrella of the DPSA. Both aim to bring value to government 
in terms of ICT use for internal administrative applications and general government service 
prov ision to citizens and businesses alike.  
This institutional fragmentation leads to coordination and collective action problems, with many blurred, 
overlapping, and sometimes undefined responsibilities. Following the organizational changes introduced 
in 2014 , the DPSA and DTPS have focused on relevant parts of the e -Government agenda. However, 
coordination of efforts has been difficult due to multiple regulations and less than clear allocations of 
roles and responsibilities, despite progress made over the pas t few years. World Bank (2019) mapped the 
roles and responsibilities of the various actors in the e -Government space to the EU e -Government 
framework used by all 34 EU member and candidate countries.63 This comparative analysis (Figure 11) 
identified sever al overlaps and challenges with these roles. Critically, coordination role itself is not clearly 
defined, with DTPS de facto filling this space and assuming this role at times. Going forward, it would be 
important to clarify the specific role of each key e ntity to minimize coordination and communication 
challenges.

The institutional picture looks more cohesive at the provincial level, at least in the two leading provinces: 
Gauteng and Western Cape.  
● Gauteng is the only province in South Africa  that has a dedicated Department of e -Government, 
established in 2015. Form erly a Shared Services Center (S SC) within the Department of Treasury, 
the Department of e -Government has been building credibility by focusing on change 
management, specifically changing the internal culture and behavioral norms, fashioning itself as 
a service center and creating a client -oriented culture toward other provincial departments.  Its 
mandate is the implementation of the Gauteng e -Government Strategy, approved at the 
beginning of the provincial administration that covers a comprehensive space i ncluding digital 
infrastructure, skills, cybersecurity, big data, and development of e -services, including a single 
platform (electronic one -stop shop).  
● The Western Cape. Like in most other provinces, the e -Government agenda in the Western Cape 
is driven from the Office of the Premier.  The Western Cape Office of the Premier houses a sizeable 
ICT unit that includes four key directorates and employs about 300 full -time staff and additional 
120 contractors. The Premier’s ICT unit is responsible for the imple mentation of the provincial 
Digital Government Strategy and relies on the ICT units and ICT champions in all provincial 
departments. The Western Cape Digital Government Strategy is similarly comprehensive as in 
Gauteng, and includes infrastructure and conn ectivity, service delivery, information security, data 
governance, and digital empowerment of both citizens and government employees.  
3.2.2.  Data policy and frameworks  
There are several aspects to the data building block for government digital platforms. On the o ne hand, 
there is a question of protection of personal privacy; on the other, there is a push for information sharing 
and transparency to citizens at large.  At the same time, data protection and privacy is not about 
information being confidential, but rat her about the data subjects having consent and control over their 
data, and data controllers and processors taking appropriate responsibility to secure personal 
information. This tension between privacy and transparency is again shaped by legal, technical,  
behavioral, and political economy aspects. However, the underlying premise is that if the privacy of

 21 personal information is protected, there are sizeable benefits of data sharing among the departments and 
agencies for the benefits of citizens. Data shari ng can reduce costs of service delivery: citizens only need 
to be contacted once; citizens do not need to furnish the data to one agency that another agency already 
has on file; and in addition, more transparency improves the ability of citizens to monitor  and provide 
feedback on service delivery.  A related aspect is the government’s capacity to process data and utilize 
data analytics for policy making, especially in the rapidly evolving world of the big data.  
RSA has a Protection of Personal Information ( POPI) Act, parts of which recently became effective with 
appointment of a new Information Regulator. POPI sets out conditions to lawfully process the personal 
information of data subjects (people and firms). The POPI Act does not require the Departments an d 
Agencies that process personal data to get consent from the data subjects; however, Departments and 
Agencies information processors are responsible for complying with the POPI conditions. If Departments 
and Agencies outsources processing, it is also resp onsible for a failure by their contractors to meet the 
conditions. The biggest compliance burden is therefore borne by the citizen -facing service -delivery 
Departments and Agencies that process personal information, such as Departments of Home Affairs or 
Department of Health.  
On the other side of the equation, the open data policy at the national level is driven by the Open 
Government Partnership (OGP).  In its OGP Action Plan, South Africa has committed to developing a pilot 
national open data portal and co nsolidating various datasets from across the three branches of 
government. The main objective is to enable citizens and businesses to easily access government 
published data. Aside from increasing transparency and accountability, the objective of the porta l is also 
to allow for the development of user -centric applications utilizing data published on the portal. DPSA was 
the main implementing institution, with support from Government Communication and Information 
Services (GCIS), Innovation Hub, DTI, and fir ms and CSOs (OpenUp, Microsoft, Chillisoft).  After the piloting 
phase and early results in 2016, the permanent Portal is currently in its beta testing version.  “The pilot 
national open data portal and hackathons opened government’s eyes to new possibilit ies of collaboration 
around open data and has successfully served as the basis for the further development of a permanent 
open data portal,” according to the OGP report. Moreover, “locally, many metropolitan municipalities 
(Cape Town, Ekurhuleni, Johannesb urg, and eThekwini) are in initial discussions for establishing open data 
portals and/or hosting hackathons. This is evidence of growing interest in using open government data to 
solve government problems and foster innovation and entrepreneurship.” (OGP A nnual Report 2017)  
The government has some capabilities for data analytics, but big data use is still an area of growth.  A 
behavioral change is taking place within all levels of the government stemming from the understanding 
that data needs to be taken more seriously than in the past.  Hackathons are increasingly popular to come 
up with new solutions for public sector problems.  Within the Departments and Agencies, CPSI is 
incentivizing innovative data analytics, including visualization and infogra phics, through CPSI annual Public 
Sector Innovation Awards that focus on innovative ways to improve service delivery and evidence -based 
decision -making. The demand from policy -makers is growing, hence these capacities are being developed 
at a faster pace.  
At the provincial level, there is a similarly upward trajectory for the demand for data analytics and 
utilization of big data.   
 22 • Gauteng. Big data analytics are part of the provincial e -Government strategy. Because Gauteng is 
geographically smallest but demographically largest while also enjoying a relatively high level of 
development, the province can entice private sector and nati onal government support to pioneer big 
data approaches. There are currently three big data projects in the province (education, treasury, and 
Office of the Premier) being implemented through PPPs (including with Microsoft and local companies 
and academic i nstitutions). Demonstration effects are expected within three years.  
• Western Cape.  The provincial government has pursued a goal of data -driven service delivery and 
decision -making.  It has become very capable at collecting the data for monitoring but i s still ramping 
up its capacities to analyze and act upon the data.  This requires a certain shift in the mindset that was 
spearheaded by the Western Cape Delivery Support Unit (DSU) in the Office of the Premier.  DSU’s 
trademark has been very strong data analytics to drive the implementation of Premier’s priorities 
(game changers), which has had a demonstration effect for other Departments and Agencies.  
3.2.3.   Interoperability, Back -office systems, and shared services  
Because interoperability relates to data and  process sharing among Departments and Agencies, it involves 
technical, legal, and behavioral aspects. South Africa has a recently -updated national -level policy 
document on interoperability. The basic premise is that because all IT procurement is centraliz ed in SITA, 
the procured systems should by design adhere to a minimum interoperability standards (MIOS). However, 
in practice this is not always the case. Sometimes there are technical reasons, such as legacy systems that 
precede SITA and MIOS; at other ti mes, there is a lack of connectivity at the last -instance service delivery 
point (e.g. maternity ward) that prevents accessing a more centralized database (e.g. Department of 
Home Affairs and birth registrations).   
In theory, the OGCIO coordinates through  GITOC to ensure the MIOS; however, this does not always result 
in interoperability in practice. There are also legal and legislative hurdles that prevent exchange of data 
among Departments and Agencies , including the POPI Act that limits the ability of de partments to share 
information. Some of these issues are also behavioral, where there is reluctance to share information that 
may be a source of power or revenue.  At the technical level, there is no concerted push for mainstreaming 
of Application Programm ing Interfaces (APIs) that would allow limited queries from one system to the 
other. The latest version of MIOS does not even refer to APIs, which suggests there may be a capacity 
issue relating to the understanding of the latest developments in the field.  At the provincial level, there 
are limited legacy systems, so interoperability is easier to ensure given that most of the digital systems 
are new.  
Key back -office systems are mostly digitized in South Africa at the national level. This includes the 
transv ersal systems, such as financial management, payroll and procurement. SITA is responsible for the 
maintenance of these systems, even if some of them have been developed with the assistance from 
private sector, often decades ago. National Treasury is the ow ner of these key systems and the driver of 
the reform. Crucially, however, the transversal systems are not fully integrated and are becoming 
outdated. The beginnings of integration efforts date back to 2003 and have still not been completed. The 
transversa l systems are shared between the national and provincial levels.  At the provincial level, there 
is still a preponderance of manual systems in health and education, mainly due to the limited broadband 
availability at the level of schools and clinics.    
 23 There is no single Electronic Government Procurement (e -GP) system in South Africa covering a 
comprehensive end -to-end processes of procurement system conducting procurements using functions 
and tools online, except the publication of transversal procurement (like a Framework Agreement) in g -
Commerce portal, which is already in use.  In April 2015, the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer 
(OCPO) launched the e -Tender Publication portal and the Central Supplier Database (CSD). National and 
provincial departm ents publish their tenders in accordance with the demand plans for acquisition of 
goods, services and infrastructure. The e -Tender portal was the first step towards implementing 
government’s e -GP system as part of the Integrated Financial Management System  and directly 
contributed to reducing duplication, fragmentation and inefficiency in government tender publications. 
However, it would be advisable to implement the end -to-end e -GP system covering all procurement 
processes addressing all the dimensions of public procurement good governance dimensions like 
transparency, accountability, efficiency and effectiveness, equity, rule of law, predictability, citizen 
engagement and value for money for socio -economic development .  
Shared or common ICT services are a growth area at both national and provincial levels. Nationally, as of 
April 1, 2019, SITA was expected to launch South Africa’s first government cloud (gCloud) platform. SITA 
partnered with private sector companies (Gijima, IBM and Huawei) to develop gClou d.  Departments of 
Higher Education and Training, Department of Labor, National Space Agency, and Gauteng provincial 
government are among the early adopters, and have relocated their storage and hosting from data 
centers to the gCloud. Introducing gCloud a s a shared service for Departments and Agencies will 
contribute not only to modernization, capability and improved services, but also to government business 
continuity.   
In addition, at the provincial level, there is further push toward common ICT service s. These efforts focus 
as much on the technical part of the issue as well as on the change management requiring behavioral 
changes, including building trust in centrally provided systems.  
• In Gauteng in 2018, provincial Cabinet approved the centralization of five functions in e -
Government department: broadband, SAP enterprise resource planning, Microsoft licensing, 
Security Operations Center (SOC), and data center services.  
• In Western Cape,  some of the shared services include: the provincial project management system 
(Microsoft -based); internal data governance; and client relations management. There is also a 
shared website for all provincial departments maintained centrally; however, updati ng is a 
challenge as it is not an ICT issue but rather a communication strategy issue.  Western Cape is also 
at the forefront of integration of the transversal systems (FM, payroll, procurement), although 
the effort is driven nationally by the National Tre asury.   
3.2.4.  Digital I dentity  
Trust in a person or entity’s identity is critical for the ability of governments, firms and citizens to engage 
in various transactions, including service delivery. Official forms of identification, e.g. ID cards, birth 
certificates and passports, have tra ditionally served this purpose, but the emergence of the digital 
economy has necessitated verifiable digital identity credentials. Digital ID systems facilitate the secure 
identification and authentication of a person, entity or device —both in person and/o r online —and bind 
the user of an online transaction with their “real world” or legal identity. Combined with digital certificate 
services (e.g., public -key infrastructure or PKI), they are also the basis for e -signatures, which enable 
knowledge, approval, acceptance, or obligation to be indicated without physical presence.   
 24 South Africa has a strong identity ecosystem comprising digitized and fully -integrated national ID and civil 
registration systems, which are built on a comprehensive national population register.64 The Department 
of Home Affairs (DHA) is responsible for maintaining these systems, including the provision of registration 
and related services through 574 offices at regional and district levels, and mobile units that travel across 
the country . The national ID system is known as the Home Affairs National Identification System 
(HANIS ), and it includes fingerprints for biometric authentication and deduplication. Since 2013, DHA has 
been replacing expired green barcoded ID books with a national ID smartcard, which is expected to be 
completed by 2023. However, the rollout has been slow, owing to the fact t hat less than half of DHA 
offices are equipped with equipment to electronically capture fingerprints, which is a requirement for the 
new smartcard.  
The 2017 ID4D -Findex survey found indicates that 92 percent of the population in South Africa aged 15 
and ab ove has a national ID card (either the green barcoded ID book or the new national ID smartcard, 
with lower levels of coverage among vulnerable populations. Combined with the current high birth 
registration rate, an estimated 90 to 95 percent of South Afric a’s population are  registered. This places 
South Africa among the highest levels of ID coverage in the world, let alone in Africa. Two key reasons for 
the high coverage are: (1) that registration services are widely -accessible across the country, including  in 
hospitals for birth registration; and (2) that the national ID and civil registration system are used for public 
and private sector service delivery, therefore generating demand for and value in these systems. Crucially, 
the DHA has committed to addres sing disparities in coverage among vulnerable populations such as 
migrants and refugees.  
Usage of the national ID system for identity authentication is largely limited to face -to-face transactions, 
except for some banks having access (in some cases for a f ee) to remotely verify information against the 
HANIS for customer onboarding. This service through HANIS have enabled users to reduce fraud and 
administrative costs, such as eliminating staff time needed to manually validate ID documents. In 2016, 
the Mini ster for Home Affairs speculated that approximately R322 million was being saved per month 65. 
It is noteworthy, however, that few other sectors have the opportunity to leverage the HANIS for identity 
verification services, which points to a conclusion that  the full impact of the HANIS is not necessarily being 
realized.  
The DHA is in the process of transforming itself, including to replace the HANIS with a National Identity 
System (NIS) that will support digital identity and authentication, which are prerequ istes for trust in the 
digital economy. A policy white paper on the repositioning of DHA was released for public comment in 
early 2019. 66 The white paper acknowledges that the DHA has an opportunity to accelerate South Africa’s 
development by introducing a  NIS that would be a platform that enables trusted electronic transactions 
online, as well as underpin smarter digital government. However, it is notable that the white paper does 
not consider alternative models to a centralized digital identity system, su ch as a federated model as what 
operates in the UK and Scandinavian countries, and is emerging in Canada, Thailand and several other 
Asian countries. Such federated models work best in countries with a dynamic private sector who can act 
as third party digi tal identity providers (along with public sector entities such as DHA) and a strong capacity 
to regulate and supervise those digital identity providers, which, it could be argued, South Africa 
possesses.

 25 An important opportunity exists for South Africa to introduce a new digital identity system that will drive 
inclusive growth of the digital economy and facilitate cross -border transactions (both within Africa and 
abroad), and could be a model for other countries. Crucially, South Africa has what m any other countries, 
particularly in Africa, lack: high coverage and a strong existing national ID system (for face -to-face 
transactions). These are assets that can be leveraged to effectively build a digital identity layer on top, 
whether centralized or f ederated. In order to be successful, the NIS should be designed as a platform and 
with interoperability in mind, and digital identity should be seen as a whole -of-government issue and not 
one exclusively for DHA to solve, which is evident by the removal of  “Home Affairs” from the name of the 
new system. For instance, there are use cases such as online land or business registration that will make 
doing business easier, and others such as social assistance that will accelerate efforts to reduce 
inequalities a nd poverty. Furthermore, building on the white paper, consideration should be given to 
exploring a federated model for digital identity in South Africa - at least in the long -term - looking to best 
practices from across the world, particularly related to d ata protection and privacy -by-design 67. Finally, 
South Africa can demonstrate leadership on mutual recognition of digital identities within SADC and 
across Africa, which can boost regional integration and, importantly, South Africa’s digital economy  
3.2.5.   Digital Services  
Digital service delivery has received much attention in South Africa in recent years.  The 2017 National e -
Government Strategy and Roadmap includes a vision “to digitize government services while transforming 
South Africa into an inclusive  digital society and economy.” This national strategy encompasses several 
specific objectives linked to public service delivery and innovation both in public and private sector, 
including developing capacity and skills for effective service delivery, foste ring innovation in technologies 
and applications to service delivery (e.g. cloud computing, big data, internet of things, mobile 
innovations), and transforming the way government interacts with citizens while providing services.  
National e -Government Cent ral Portal had been launched in 2018, for access to selected online services, 
as a part of new e -Government roadmap; however, there is currently no inventory or registry of all online 
services maintained by DPSA or DTPS. The UN’s four -stage maturity model of e-Government has been 
selected to categorize online services, in line with good practices seen in many countries. SITA is expected 
to develop the necessary integration platform to connect each department back -end systems with the 
central portal (front -office) with the objective of improving the level of online services (connected 
services).  
Because there is no single portal for digital services at the national level yet, it is not immediately possible 
to take stock how many services have been automated and at what level.  Currently, DTPS maintains two 
domains www.gov.za and www.services.gov.za with different classification of the partial list of the existing 
digital services.  However, the process of digitization and automation is quite decentralized acr oss 
individual Departments and Agencies; these tend to do the work either in -house, or through SITA, or by 
utilizing public -private partnerships.  New services and apps are added online frequently, mostly at levels 
1-3 of automation. There is a growing num ber of mobile applications.  
 
67  The ten Principles on Identification for Sustainable Development, which have been endorsed by 25 international organizations, offer a useful 
guiding framework of best practices. They are available at http://id4d.worldbank.org/principles   
 26 Provincial governments and municipalities have their own websites and menu of services. Provincial 
governments are the providers of key services such as health and education, as well as local police, 
agriculture, transport and other services.  
● Gauteng.  As part of the implementation of the provincial e -Government strategy, the 
Department of e -Government has developed a single online platform for service delivery by the 
province that was launched on May 13, 2019.  However, startin g already in 2018, 42 e -services 
went live on the new platform as a “minimum viable product.” The Departments of Health, 
Education, Agriculture, Roads & Transport, and others are the service providers, while the 
Department of e -Government serves as a facil itator for the design, validation, and quality control 
for digital services.  
● Western Cape. The current modernization efforts focus on higher levels of automation – i.e., 
moving towards transactions online.  Western Cape adopted citizen -centric approach.  T his 
includes determining the demand for particular services that citizens would like to access online 
and focusing on developing the associated systems. This has led to digitizing popular services, 
including: (i) health - patient -doctor interface (single p atient view); (ii) transport – integrated 
transport app with a scanning function (licensing; fines); (iii) agriculture – farm inspectors can 
automatically upload their reports with digital PINs; and others. In addition, citizen -centricity also 
involves act ively pushing information and select services to citizens via online or mobile platform, 
rather than simple access to services.  
3.3. RECOMMENDATIONS AND NEXT STEPS 
The state of the digital platforms in South Africa reflects both the country’s relatively advanced position 
on various digital government dimensions, as well as some of the bottlenecks related to their resourcing, 
coordination, and M&E. To achieve the Digi tal Economy for Africa  targets for all South African citizens, 
the key recommendations for public digital platforms include:  
First, it is crucial to adequately resource the implementation of the national and provincial digital 
government strategies.  A con sistent feedback from the implementing Departments and Agencies has 
been the shortage of resources for the implementation of the National e -Government Strategy and 
Roadmap.  Reviewing the available resources at both the national and provincial level would be the first 
step toward making this agenda a priority, consistent with President Ramaphosa’s call to use Fourth 
Industrial Revolution technologies to accelerate the improvement of people’s lives in South Africa.  If a 
budget shortfall is indeed identified , then fostering public -private partnerships could be one of the 
possible solutions.  
Second, for these efforts to succeed, it will be important to improve coordination and communication 
among Departments and Agencies driving this agenda at the national lev el.  The analysis in this chapter 
identified a fragmentation and proliferation of institutions at the national level responsible for digital 
government, leading to coordination and collective action problems, with many blurred and overlapping 
responsibilit ies. Coordination role itself is not clearly defined. In order to consistently drive and implement  
 27 this agenda, it will be important for the center of government to clarify the specific role of each key entity 
involved in the digital government at the nati onal level.  
Third, taking a holistic view of interoperability challenges will remove some of the existing bottlenecks.  
To achieve better interoperability, a set of interdisciplinary measures are required.  First, a legal and 
regulatory review is needed to  ensure that the Departments and Agencies are legally allowed to share 
data.  Second, a concerted push to mainstream APIs would help to ensure that the databases of various 
Departments and Agencies can communicate with each other on a selective as -needed b asis. Finally, an 
adoption and implementation of a change management strategy would allow to target behavioral 
constraints for further data sharing and openness.  
Fourth, digital capacity building within public sector requires more emphasis. SITA provides t raining on 
the transversal systems but training on data skills, big data analytics and broader aspects of e -Government 
and digital platforms are lacking.   Considering the role of government training institutions such as the 
National School of Government (a lso under DPSA), there is an opportunity to rethink the offerings of such 
institutions.   Other institutions (e.g. Canada School of Public Service, Brazil’s ENAP) already offer Big Data 
Fundamentals and Analytics and related subjects.  
Finally, taking stock,  monitoring and evaluating the development of digital services will greatly improve 
their efficiency, cost -effectiveness, and citizen -centricity.  While government digital services are clearly an 
area of rapid development in South Africa, the process is ve ry decentralized and seems poorly coordinated 
and monitored.  This will ultimately constrain the uptake and efficiency of provision of these services.  To 
this end, an entity should be identified that would take stock of all the digital services available at the 
national and provincial levels and monitor the number of users and transactions.  This will avoid 
duplication and will aid in further improvement and efficiency of e -services.  Eventually, it will also help 
to make digital service delivery more citi zen-centric.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 28 4. DIGITAL FINANCIAL SERVICES  
 
4.1. BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE OF DIGITAL FINANCIAL SERVICES  
Digital financial services provide individuals and firms with convenient and affordable channels by which 
to pay, as well as to save and borrow. Firms can leverage digital financial services to more easily transact 
with their customers and suppliers, as we ll as build digital credit histories and seek financing. 
Governments can use digital financial services to increase efficiency and accountability in various payment 
streams, including for the disbursement of social transfers and receipt of tax payments. A digital financial 
services ecosystem requires a forward -looking and proportionate legal and regulatory framework (e.g., to 
allow market entry and innovation), robust financial infrastructures (e.g., national payment systems and 
credit reporting systems), a nd development and deployment of low -cost delivery channels (e.g., agents, 
point of sale devices, automated teller machines, mobile phones).  South Africa’s financial sector is 
adopting digitization across wide range of financial segments including payment s, savings and deposit, 
lending, insurance and capital markets. Amongst these the payment and lending segments are most 
prominent and the main focus of this section.  
 South Africa has made significant progress on access to digital financial services (DFS),  however concerted 
efforts are needed to further increase usage of available financial services.  Despite the wide range of 
payment options available in the sophisticated banking system, cash remains a dominant means of 
payment for a large percentage of th e population.  Given high unemployment and inequality, the disparity 
between the available financial services in the advanced side of the economy and the needs of the 
consumers particularly in the less advanced side of the economy is significant.  Governme nt and the 
private sector have over the years embarked on initiatives aimed at addressing this disparity and these 
have included introduction of cards for social benefits, shift of government payments from cash to 
electronic transfer, financial products an d services for the unbanked, including domestic and cross border 
money transfer services, airtime transfers, bill payments.  
According to the 2017 Global Findex survey, 60 percent of South Africa adults (ages 15+) reported having 
made or received a digital  payment in the past year, well above Sub -Saharan Africa average. While the 60 
percent is in line with the average for middle -income countries, there is room to significantly increase 
usage of available financial services as shown in Figure 12.

4.2. DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS : CURRENT STATE OF DIGITAL FINANCIAL SERVICES  
Account ownership among South Africans is significantly higher than in the Sub -Saharan A frica region and 
on par with middle -income countries (MICs). According to the 2017 Global Findex survey, 69 percent of 
adults (ages 15+) have an account at a financial institution or used mobile money account compared to 
65 percent for middle -income countr ies. Compared to regional peers on account ownership, South Africa 
exceeds Senegal and Nigeria by a wide margin but lags Kenya. However, when compared to its BRICS peers 
it is on par with Brazil but lags China, India and Russia. The shift in government pay ments from cash to 
electronic transfer methods such as direct deposits to bank accounts and usage of pre -paid cards made a 
significant contribution to account ownership in South Africa.

Though 60 percent of South African adults reported having made or received digital payments, the usage 
of debit cards (other t han for cash withdrawal) and other electronic payment instruments remains low. 
Even among individuals holding a transaction account with a bank, 33 percent still withdraw all their 
money as soon as it is deposited.68 Only 20.6 percent of adults used mobile  phone or internet to access 
an account compared to 72 percent in Kenya and 29 percent in Senegal. Moreover, of the percentage of 
adults paying for utility bills, only 32 percent used an account while 64 percent used cash only.69

4.2.1.  Role of Banks  in provision of DFS  
South Africa has a large and sophisticated banking sector that is investing significant resources in 
digitization. As at end of 2017 , the banking  sector which is dominated by five70 major banks  had assets 
account ing for 108 percent of GDP. Many banks have digital strategies to modernize their delivery 
channels and enable use of digital data f or decision making purposes.  In 2016 major banks in South Africa 
spend between 10 percent and 18 percent of operating costs on IT expenditure.71 Disruptive innovation 
in the traditional deposit -taking space has seen more digital banks enter the market, th ese include 
Discovery, Tyme and Bank Zero72. 
In response to changing customer needs, many banks have modernized their delivery channels to facilitate 
provision of digital banking mechanisms through the internet banking and mobile banking applications.  A 
wide range of electronic payment instruments are offered (payment cards, electronic fund transfers etc.) 
and the volume of electronic transactions has been on the rise over the past years with electronic fund 
transfer largely replacing cheques and widely us ed by employers to pay salaries.    
In South Africa, only locally registered banks may issue e -money, since issuing e -money is considered as 
deposit -taking.73 Hence, despite a high mobile phone penetration, mobile money market is still in its 
infancy with only 19 percent of South Africans (ages 15 years +) having a mobile money account. Non -

71 COEFS, Impact of Fourth Industrial Revolution on South Africa Financial Services  
72However, it should be noted that these banks might still require certain on -boarding requirements to be conducted in person   
73 E-Money can be further differentiated into prepaid cards, online money and mobile money.  
 
 31 banks attribute the low percentage to the legal framework that requires non -banks to offer their services 
jointly with a bank, which reduces profitability and flexibilit y in their product and service offering. Existing 
mobile money solutions are not interoperable, resulting in a limited network size and/or customer 
acceptance. The relatively high share of the population that has a transaction accounts reduces the 
incentiv e to open mobile money accounts. However, the high propensity of over -the-counter domestic 
remittances indicates that there are payment service needs currently unmet by transaction account 
offerings by banks.  
Despite broad range of DFS service and products  offered, usage of DF services and products remains low 
due to factors ranging from high infrastructure cost to low customers awareness and preference for cash.  
As the World Bank South Africa Retail Banking Diagnostic (2017) highlighted, product design an d fees on 
transaction accounts by major banks do not distinguish between low -income and high -income customers 
thus making these products costly for low -income customers. In addition, consumers may be reluctant to 
use internet or mobile banking due to high cost, including the cost of data / airtime to access such 
electronic services, as highlighted in the financial infrastructure section of the report. Importantly, for at 
least a portion of the population, and not necessarily because of low income, there is likely to be a strong 
preference for human interaction, whether due to a lack of understanding, or lack of trust or comfort, 
with electronic channels.  
4.2.2.  Role of Fintech and non -banks in DFS  
Digital developments have also been observed in other areas of the f inancial system from lending to 
capital markets.  Fintech has the potential to increase access to financial services through digital channels 
and by reducing barriers to entry. In line with the Bali Fintech Agenda we have used the term fintech to 
describe the advances in technology that have the potential to transform the provision of financial 
services spurring the development of new business models, applications, processes, and products. South 
Africa’s fintech industry is small – with a current estimation  of 219 firms74 - but growing and gaining 
international recognition. The large majority of fintechs  in South Africa provide services already provided 
by traditional financial services providers such as banks. However, fintechs aim to provide these services 
faster and cheaper, often servicing low income consumers who have been historically excluded. There  are 
however several barriers to growth and scale such as the funding environment and the shortage of skills 
as highlighted in the digital entrepreneurship and digital skills sections of the report.  
The use of smartphones as mobile point of sale devices is  reducing the cost and complexity of payments. 
As with other regions across the world, mobile payments have been the first area to be disrupted by the 
new wave of emerging technology. Solutions like Snapscan and Zapper are eliminating the need for point 
of sale devices altogether. These are being supported by innovative security measures such as location -
based identification, biometrics, and card tokenization which protects customers and increases 
confidence in digital channels.  
Bank -fintech collaboration in South Africa has matured as the fintech market developed. This contrasts 
with the early approach which was to acquire fintech to limit their growth. The market is now seeing much 
more collaboration in this sector from bank -sponsored fintech accelerators  to partnering with startups, 
which is also leading to the development of more business to business (B2B) solutions such as those for 
digital ID or cybersecurity. Another interesting feature that has been associated with the development of 
 
74 Fintech Landscaping report forthcoming: National Treasury, World Bank, Genesis   
 32 fintechs is the growth of banking -as-a-platform where a platform sometimes housed by a bank draws in 
products and services from an array of innovative third -party providers that exist outside the core banking 
architecture.  
Besides fintech, several banks use third -party ag ents to facilitate customer acquisition and product usage 
while several banks use retail stores (e.g. Shoprite, Pep, Pick’n Pay) to facilitate transactions. Services 
provided by these retailers consist essentially of domestic money transfers, cash back fro m bank accounts 
(including social grant payouts), third -party bill payments, and the sale of co -branded access -type 
accounts. For example, ABSA bank has a relationship with Pep whereby co -branded PEP plus debit cards 
can be purchased at Pep via an off -the-shelf debit card. The Pep staff at the till undertake the necessary 
customer due diligence requirements.  
Third -party agent models have not been sufficiently leveraged to reach the ‘last mile’ and improve access 
for financial consumers in South Africa. Whil e data gaps and limitations do not allow for a robust 
comparison of agent networks across countries, it appears that South African banks have not fully 
leveraged the potential of third -party agent models to reduce transaction costs by using existing 
infras tructure to reach financial consumers.  
4.2.3.  Policy and Regulatory Environment  
In 2018 National Payment System Framework and Strategy Vision 2025 was launched and National 
Payment System (NPS) policy document was issued. The strategy focuses on a broad range of reforms 
including promoting competition and innovation, interoperability, flexibility and adaptability and financial 
inclusion. To achieve this objective the SARB using its statutory payment system oversight and regulatory 
powers has initiated the review o f NPS legislative and regulatory framework and has issued policy paper 
on required changes to the NPS Act and related regulatory framework.  
The Payments Association of South Africa (PASA) a payment system management body with delegated 
authority from the S ARB is the main regulatory body for retail payments in South Africa.  PASA’s mandate 
is to authorize retail payments system operators to operate in the South African NPS. PASA is governed 
by a constitution that defines its functions, structures and activit ies as a self -regulatory body.   Currently 
PASA has 28 members, all of which are banks with two exceptions: Diners Club and Postbank which are 
“designated clearing system participants”. In addition, PASA has authorized 4 PCH system operators (Visa, 
MasterC ard, BankservAfrica and Strate) and 80 payment system operators.  
Importantly, the ‘twin peaks’ regulatory and supervisory model adopted in 2018 has key implications for 
NPS supervision.  The reform has led to establishment of a new regulator, namely the Fin ancial Sector 
Conduct Authority (FSCA) that will be responsible for  market conduct issues that impact customers in the 
payment environment.The definition of the scope of the FSCA’s involvement in the payment system is yet 
to be finalized and included in t he relevant regulatory provisions. .75 
Policy and Regulation - Market Entry  
The non -banks role in payment space is constrained due to regulatory barriers. The South Africa Banks 
Act limits the activities of taking deposits and provision of payment services to banks. Article 1 of the Act 
clearly sets out definitions for a deposit a nd the business of a bank which clearly delegates payment 
 
75 Review of the National Payment System Act 78 of 1998, Policy Paper, September 20 18, SARB   
 33 intermediation to banks and prohibits ‘non -banks’ from accepting deposits, unless sponsored by a bank. 
Under the NPS Act, non -banks can operate as third -party payment providers to process payments t hat 
are due to third parties.  
Policy and Regulation - Delivery Channel and Innovation  
An Intergovernmental Fintech Working Group (IFWG) has been established to provide a mechanism for 
policy makers and regulators to jointly understand fintech developments  and create an enabling Fintech 
policy. IFWG is comprised of representatives from the National Treasury, the South African Reserve Bank, 
the Financial Sector Conduct Authority, and the Financial Intelligence Center (FIC). Based on initial 
consultations wit h industry and civil society, including fintech firms, the IFWG formed workstreams, 
including on private crypto assets, peer to peer lending, innovation policy and engagements (including the 
formation of innovation hubs).  
The IFWG is working on Fintech policy and strategy for South Africa to develop a conducive regulatory 
environment. Moreover, a position paper on crypto assets was developed by SARB in 2014 which 
highlighted benefits and perceived risks. Based on extensive consultations coordinat ed by IFWG a 
consultation paper on crypto assets released for comment in January 2019.  
Innovation hubs are being considered to stay apprised of fintech developments while providing an 
environment for collaboration. Three structures have been proposed as pa rt of the Innovation Hub: an 
Innovation Accelerator, a Regulatory Guidance Unit, and a Regulatory Sandbox. The Innovation 
Accelerator as currently modelled will be an internal SARB structure, led by the Fintech Unit, to fast -track 
new processes or approach es. The Regulatory Guidance Unit is intended to provide non -binding guidance 
to fintech and financial sector private sector actors navigating the regulatory framework. A Financial 
Sector Regulatory Sandbox is also proposed to enable live testing of innovat ions in a controlled 
environment while dialoguing with the regulator. Both the Regulatory Guidance Unit and Regulatory 
Sandbox will be jointly owned by the IFWG. The development of these structures is ongoing.  
The South African NPS has achieved full intero perability of ATM infrastructure through the SASWITCH 
service provided by BankServ Africa.  However, in their quest to facilitate person to person (P2P) transfers 
and purchases of goods and services, banks and other non -bank players have developed innovati ve 
products that have led to a proliferation of proprietary payment instruments (e.g.  mobile money, prepaid 
cards) and proprietary payment solutions (e.g. domestic remittances, transit payments) which are not 
interoperable.   
The use of Quick Response ( QR) code payment schemes is also fast finding its way into the South African 
market; however, these schemes are also not interoperable.  Unless significant interoperability is achieved 
adoption of this technology by consumers and merchants may fail to achiev e scale.  Although some efforts 
are reported to be under way by some providers to address this, an industrywide initiative may be ideal 
to achieve full interoperability.   An opportunity to establish interoperability at the technical/operational 
level base d on a commercial model which attracts under - and unserved end customers has therefore not 
been exploited.  
Exclusivity arrangements are present in the market and will continue to hamper competition.  Western 
Union and MoneyGram are the dominant players in the money transfer operator space and have included 
exclusivity clauses in their agent agreements with banks and exchange bureaus. The existence of 
exclusivity agreements prevents remittance service providers from competing on the price and quality of  
 34 serv ices offered and acts as a barrier to entry of new remittance service providers, and stifles 
opportunities for promoting more efficient use of existing infrastructure.  
The cost of compliance with customer due diligence (CDD)/know your customer (KYC) requi rements has 
always been viewed as onerous by the banking industry, yet the cost of non -compliance can have far 
reaching financial implications.  A collaborative initiative by the banking industry to introduce KYC 
centrally managed services is underway and this is expected to bring efficiency and reduce costs.    
South Africa legislation allows for simplified KYC requirements up to certain thresholds; however, a review 
is needed to ensure these thresholds are not creating barriers to access and usage.76 “Exe mption 17” 
applies to low -value transactions in general and creates a second tier of compliance that aligns compliance 
requirements with lower risk. In addition, SARB guidance note also provides exemption for mobile banking 
and new forms of remote banking.  The maximum limit for low -value transactions and debits from such an 
account is up to R1,000 per day above which full verification is required. For cross -border remittances, 
the exemption applies to transactions of funds not exceeding R3000 per day and R1 0 000 in a calendar 
month. The aim of this exemption is to reduce the costs involved in remitting funds and thereby 
encouraging remitters to use formal channels for funds transfers.  
Policy and Regulation - Managing Risks of Digital Finance  
 
Currently , the  consumer protection framework, does not cover non -bank financial service providers, 
including payment services. The Conduct of Financial Institutions (COFI) Bill which is envisaged to provide 
comprehensive market conduct requirements under which the FSCA w ill operate was published for public 
consultation in December 2018. It is important that the bill provide adequate provisions on market 
conduct supervision including for payment service providers. In addition, FSCA is currently developing 
product standards  to improve disclosure requirements for various banking products, it would be 
important to develop such standards for digital financial products.  
The protection criteria for e -money customers’ funds is provided in the SARB Position Paper on Electronic 
Mone y.  In line with the requirements of the Bank Act, the Position Paper requires that banks managing 
e-money products hold these in a separately identifiable e -money account for each holder of e -money 
and comply with the relevant sections of the Banks Act an d its Regulations. In addition, a bank, as the 
holder of an e -money deposit, must, on demand, redeem the electronic value held on the instrument for 
central bank currency, at par. Issuers of e -money are also required to ensure that  e -money users are 
made aware of the conditions of use, the liability of the issuer and what recourse the holder of the e -
money would have in relation to the issuer.  
In 2017, SARB issued guidance note on cyber -resilience encouraging banks to adopt international 
practices related to cyber -resilience.77 Based on SARB on -site information technology reviews of banks, 
key findings suggest that maturity of IT risks at some banks require further improvement. In addition, 
though banks have adopted internationally recognized best practices  and IT risk frameworks, these 
frameworks still need to be tailored to South African banks’ specific needs. Importantly the findings 
suggest a lack of adequate cybersecurity skills, both locally and internationally. Owing to the increasing 
 
76 The exemptions to the general integrity principles for low -value transactions are established under the Financial Intelligence Center Act.  
77 The guidance note was issued following the issuance of CPMI and IOSCO guidance on cyber -resilience for  financial market infrastructures in 
June 2016   
 35 nature and compl exities of cyberattacks, most banks have increased their resources, financially and/or 
otherwise, to counteract the onslaught of cybersecurity. In addition, industry collaborations and 
information sharing with other industry players is reiterated as being crucial.78 
4.2.4.  Infrastructure: Retail Payments Infrastructure  
South Africa’s National Payment System (NPS) is well developed and has benefited from many years of 
dedicated payment systems reform efforts.  The main players in the retail payments landscape comprise: 
banks and non -bank service providers including paymen t clearing house system operators, system 
operators and third -party payment providers.  
Non -bank service providers’ access to the payment system is not automatic and has to be authorized 
subject to specific requirements.  BankServ Africa, a privately -operated automated clearinghouse (ACH) 
is the main player responsible for processing retail p ayments in South Africa.  It is responsible for switching 
and clearing interbank obligations for retail payments such as electronic fund transfers (EFT), cheques, 
card, internet and automated teller machine (ATM) transaction.  Because of its systemic natur e, BankServ 
Africa has been designated by the SARB as a financial market infrastructure (FMI) meaning that it must 
comply with international standards and best practices for such infrastructures, to which the SARB 
subscribes.  
4.2.5.  Infrastructure: Credit Infras tructure  
The credit reporting system is fairly developed and has sufficient depth particularly for individuals. There 
are currently 29 companies registered as credit bureaus under South Africa law, with four of the 
companies – TransUnion, Experian, XDS, an d Compuscan – serving as the major credit bureaus. The four 
credit bureaus principally report individual credit information and collect both positive and negative credit 
data systematically from banks, financial institutions, utility companies and retailer s.79 The banks and 
financial institutions can access borrowers credit information online. The credit bureaus provide credit 
scores that banks and financial institutions can use to assess credit worthiness. These four bureaus are 
associate members of the So uth Africa Credit and Risk Reporting Association (SACRRA), which has 
established certain rules to improve data quality (e.g. type of data, frequency of updates, definitions, etc.).  
Given limited coverage of credit data for businesses and high level of info rmality in MSME sector, 
digitization of MSME businesses and use of alternate data could help improve coverage. The estimated 
total size of South Africa’s MSME market, including formal and informal enterprises, is 5.78 million of 
which only 14 percent is fo rmalized.80 Thus much of the economic and financial activity of MSMEs is not 
recorded that can be used for credit assessment. However, these MSMEs as well as unbanked individuals 
are leaving vast digital footprints and data trails. Every time the individua ls and MSMEs use cloud -based 
services, browse the internet, use their mobile phones, engage in social media, use e -commerce 
platforms, or manage their receivables, payables, and recordkeeping online, they create digital footprints. 
Credit providers can lev erage on this alternative data including transactional (payments) data, behavioral 
data and social media data to determine capacity and willingness of a borrower to repay loans.  
 
78 SARB Banking Supervision Report 2017  
79 However South Africa has large number of registered credit providers at approximately 6,679. Of these only 2,003 are currentl y submitting 
their credit data through the transmission hub and many small credit providers are still not providing credit data.  
80 The Unseen Sector A report on the MSME Opportunity in South Africa, IFC and World Bank   
 36 4.2.6. Leveraging recurrent payments to increase usage of DFS  
Digitizing large -volume recurrent payment streams offer an opportunity to promote better use of 
accounts and other delivery channels while improving transparency and safety. In South Africa social 
grants, remittances and utility bill payments are among key channels used b y lower income segments.  
Social Grants  
About 26 percent of adults in South Africa receive a social grant compared to Sub -Saharan Africa average 
of 7 percent.81 As reported by Global Findex  data 2017, 74 percent of social grant recipients received their 
payment through an account  at a financial institution or through a mobile phone . As the World Bank’s 
2016 report highlights,82 as with many other similar programs throughout the world, a larg e share of 
recipients withdraws the full amount of grant on the same day that the funds are available.83 
Several factors may contribute to low usage of accounts and require in depth assessment beyond the 
scope of this report. Potential reasons include conc erns earlier concerns raised on unlawful debits from 
grant beneficiaries accounts, keeping grant in the account may be interpreted as an indication that 
beneficiary is no longer alive or high balance could be an indication that beneficiary does not need 
payment immediately. Another reason could be high fees on cash withdrawal and limited functionality 
available through the South Africa Social Security Agency ( SASSA ) accounts and cards.  
Promoting convenient and affordable use of SASSA account may enable reci pients to increase the usage 
of account and its electronic payment features. This includes the possibility to use the account for 
payment of utilities, airtime, to send or receive payments or make merchant payments at low or no cost. 
In addition, the possi bility to save in the account if so desired could be encouraged. Further it must be 
ensured that effective consumer protection service, redress mechanism and financial awareness training 
in connection to account is available to understand the various featu res and functionalities of their 
accounts.  
Remittances  
About 51 percent of South Africa adults sent or received domestic remittances during the past 12 months 
of which significant percentage still use over the counter service provider or cash.84 According to Findex 
2017, about 56 percent of adults who sent or received domestic remittance used an account which is 
comparable to Sub -Saharan Africa average of 51 percent but is much lower compared to 89 percent in 
Kenya. Of note, though use of mobile phone to se nd or receive remittance increased to 38 percent in 2017 
from 18 percent in 2014, it is much below 95 percent in Kenya. The use of mobile phone provides a 
convenient and low -cost channel to remit money. A significant percent used over the counter service 
provider such as retailers (32 percent of senders or recipients) and cash (16 percent of senders or 
recipients).  
The cross -border remittance market holds significant potential but remains largely informal. The 
international remittance flows of approximately  ZAR 25 -30 billion are primarily destined to Zimbabwe and 
 
81 The Global Findex Database 2017  
82 Achieving Effective Financial Inclusion in S outh Africa: A Payments Perspective, World Bank 2016  
83 Based on SASSA report, as reported by South Africa Post Bank, 85 percent of the amount was withdrawn within first week for No vember -
December 2018.  
84 The Global Findex Database 2017   
 37 Lesotho.85 Charges are substantial with the average remittance cost along formal channels estimated at 
17 percent of the value sent – nearly 10 percent above the global average.86 
Key aspect limiting further expansion in the use of account to channel remittances including prevalence 
of close -looped systems. The Mzansi money transfer service between big four banks and Postbank, which 
was established as interoperable domestic remittance service,  failed to succeed in getting significant 
market share. Cross -border remittance services are generally also closed -loop as remittance service 
providers in the originating country (South Africa) partner with limited number of disbursing agents in the 
receiv ing country.  
Utility and other bill payments  
About 47 percent of South Africa adults  paid utility bills during the past 12 months however 64 percent of 
payers made the payment using cash only. Only 32 percent used an account to pay the bill compared to 
85 percent in Kenya which is quite low considering that many banks offer bill payment o ptions through 
account. One key factor is lack of reliable and convenient platforms as well as incentives provided by utility 
companies to enable customers to pay directly to them via their accounts vis -à-vis through intermediaries 
in cash.  
4.3. RECOMMENDATIONS  AND NEXT STEPS 
Overall South Africa has made significant progress on digital financial services and non -traditional players 
including fintech are gradually transforming the market. Going forward, it would be important to upgrade 
the regulatory environment  to reduce barriers to entry to retail payment systems and support to 
development of fintech ecosystem. The interoperability of person to person payment instruments and 
solutions needs to be improved to promote usage. With the expansion of digital delivery  channels by 
banks and fintech, there is need to improve consumer protection and simplified KYC. The use of alternate 
data is gaining traction and could help in access to credit for MSMEs, particularly in the informal sector. 
Below are key recommendations.  
Need to reduce barriers on access to retail payment systems. As part of the ongoing review of NPS, Banks 
Act and relevant legislation the SARB and National Treasury needs to amend the legislation to (i) enable 
access to the NPS to all licensed/authorized entities either through a direct membership or through 
indirect membership and (ii) recognizing payments as an activity distinct from deposit taking. In addition, 
review of current policy on limiting the issuance of e -money products to only banks is need w ith the aim 
to foster and channel both bank and non -bank payment initiatives. Following review an Emoney directive 
needs to be issued. The governance and membership of PASA needs to be reviewed including to allow fair 
access to non -banks.  
Need to support t he development of the fintech ecosystem with specific emphasis on financial inclusion. 
The IFWG need to issue periodic clarifications or guidelines on regulatory interpretations specifically 
regarding the treatment of innovative activities, e.g. cloud comp uting or use of AI for financial services. 
The policy framework needs to provide possibility of a regulatory "sandbox or hub" to provide a testing 
environment to support the development of fintech that specifically supports financial inclusion.  
 
85 Technoserve (2017) , Domestic Remittances in South Africa  
86 World Bank (2017), Remittance Prices Worldwide   
 38 Promoting o pen, interoperable and interconnected systems and products to expand usage. Given the 
proliferation of proprietary payment instruments and payment solutions which are not interoperable, 
SARB needs to develop and issue regulation mandating interoperability and adoption of open standards 
to enable existing closed -loop systems to become open -loop systems or to be able to become 
interoperable with the open loop systems. There is scope to enhance the open looped systems to enable 
licensed entities to offer trans action accounts to their customers to enhance financial inclusion. Also, 
effective regulatory coordination on technology adoption such as promoting the use of a national USSD 
code for seamless interoperability would be useful.  
Improving consumer trust in d igital financial services. With the establishment of market conduct 
authority, there is need to develop product standards covering digital financial products and introduce 
simple complaint handling procedures and redress mechanism for users of digital fina ncial services that 
are currently lacking. In addition, review of KYC thresholds for basic transaction accounts, cross border 
remittances and mobile banking is needed to ensure these thresholds are not create barriers to uptake.  
Alternative sources of cred it and means of assessing credit are gaining traction. To encourage these 
developments, it would be important to implement pilots as envisioned by the National Credit Regulator 
to test the use of alternate data to improve credit risk assessment particularl y of informal businesses and 
unbanked individuals and develop framework based on pilot to expand credit information on individuals 
and MSMEs. Digitization of MSMEs would also facilitate credit expansion particularly to informal 
businesses.  
Leveraging large  volume recurrent retail payments could expand usage particularly within the low -income 
consumer segment. Promoting convenient and affordable use of SASSA account (such as for payment of 
utilities, airtime, to send or receive payments or make merchant paym ents) at low or no cost could help 
increase the usage of accounts and its electronic payment features. There is a need to introduce 
interoperability in domestic remittance services and introduce incentives to use transaction account 
and/or mobile money acc ount for sending/receiving remittances.  
   
 39 4. DIGITAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP  
 
4.1. BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE OF DIGITAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP  
Vibrant digital entrepreneurship is a key pillar of a strong digital economy, in turn a source of new products 
and services, business models, and markets. Digital entrepreneurship, seen to encompass the launch of 
new digital ventures either offering new products or leveraging existing technologies and business 
models8788, also including digital private sector platforms89,  has the potential to contribute to overall 
competitiveness and job creation. A strong entrepreneurship ecosystem90 that influences the creation and 
success of such digital ventures is instrumental in translating innovations into businesses, ultimately  
supporting wealth creation and higher standards of living for a country91.  
South Africa’s underlying digital entrepreneurship dynamics are quite positive.  South Africa is already a 
key player in Africa for digital entrepreneurship, serving as a “hub” fo r many initiatives and investments, 
and as an essential entry point for major global digital players, including, among others, Google, Airbnb, 
Amazon Web Services, and IBM Research Lab. A strengthening tech ecosystem has enabled the 
emergence of digital st artups and platforms across technology segments. A round of recent successful 
tech startups have raised over USD 100M92, and there is an expanding number of medium -sized South 
African technology companies, a growing share of which are also black -owned. In addition to creating 
jobs, digital entrepreneurs have helped drive social impact in areas such as health (e.g. HearX), transport 
and logistics (ParcelNinja), and education (GetSmarter). Successful digital entrepreneurs also reinvest in 
the ecosystem throug h funds such as Team Africa Ventures.  
However, due to key weaknesses in specific policy, available financing and support, digital 
entrepreneurship is not reaching full potential, and South Africa’s leadership is being increasingly 
challenged on the contin ent. The lack of some key ingredients and pressing gaps in regulation are holding 
South African digital entrepreneurs back. These include insufficient availability of digital skills, elevated 
infrastructure costs and limited reach, limited access to early stage finance, some specific legislation 
detrimental to business operations, insufficient coordination of entrepreneurship support initiatives, both 
public and private, including spatially, and limited diversity and inclusivity of the sector as a whole. At  the 
same time, other ecosystems on the continent are developing strongly. Botswana recently ranked number 
1 in Sub Saharan Africa in the global entrepreneurship index93, while Kenya and Nigeria also have strong 
ecosystems, as attested by the recent string of high profile exits of digital startups; relative African 
 
87 The term ‘Digital Entrepreneurship’ most commonly refers to the process of creating a new —or novel —Internet enabled/delivered business, 
product or service. This cha pter focuses on startups that bring new digital product or services to market. Welsum, v. D., World Bank Group,

88These are typically defined as young (under 5 years) firms that are pursuing growth

together by interacting with each other and by facilitating matching, searching, exchanging, transactions, and so on”. (World  Bank Gro up,

4.2. DIAGNOSTICS FINDINGS : CURRENT STATE OF DIGITAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP  
 
4.2.1.  Policy Framework and Business Environment for Digital Entrepreneurs  
Both national and provincial governments are playing a strong role in the developmen t of digital 
entrepreneurship in South Africa; but current policies fail to reflect changing global operating conditions 
in the industry, while policy action suffers from lack of coordination and insufficient monitoring. Although 
South Africa’s Doing Busin ess could be improved overall (82nd out of 190)94, overall support for 
entrepreneurship is quite pro -active, through a number of specific agencies (e.g. Technology Innovation 
Agency) and programmes (e.g. Technology & Human Resource in Industry Programme, S upport 
Programme for Industrial Innovation, SA SME Fund), at both the national and provincial levels - with the 
Western Cape and Gauteng provinces being the most dynamic. The SA SME Fund95, launched by the 
President in March 2019 as a partnership between t he national government and corporate South Africa 
for example, foresees that R1,4 billion will be invested into SMEs and startups through pre -selected fund 
managers with an established track record to kick start economic growth.  However, those initiatives  often 
suffer from insufficient adequacy to the specific needs of the sector, especially in the early phases of 
business development; implementation, coordination and fragmentation remains a significant issue, 
leading to confusion for entrepreneurs and sup port organizations; and policies lack robust monitoring and 
evaluation frameworks, leading to a likely sub -optimum allocation of resources. The national 
government’s e -Government strategy (examined in chapter 3) although going in the right direction, has 
not yet significantly reduced the administrative burden on digital startups.  
Furthermore, some of the existing policies turn out to be either difficult to implement in practice and 
would need to be adapted, or have an adverse effect on the operations of dig itally enabled startups. The 
following paragraphs will examine in turn: (i) R&D tax incentives; (ii) IP legislation and requirements; (iii) 
exchange controls; (iv) VAT & Corporate tax issues; (v) ICT and related sector policies; and (vi) labor 
legislation.  
 
The R&D tax incentive scheme has a cost recovery model that does not benefit SMEs or startups which 
do not pay taxes until they are profitable, resulting in none of the initial development costs being tax 
exempt in practice. The SA government provides tax relief for companies e ngaging in R&D, allowing 
them to claim up to 150% of qualifying costs against their income tax and accelerated depreciation. This 
incentive was designed to encourage private -sector investment in scientific and technological research 
and development activit ies and to help the country achieve a target for R&D expenditure of 1% of GDP, 
but is not designed for high value and research intensive technology startups, which typically do not 
break even in their first years of operations; it could thus be usefully ad apted. The recently released DST

state -nation -address -7-feb-2019 -0000 ) 
95South African SME Fund, 2019. https://sasmefund.co.za/   
 41 White Paper on Science Technology and Innovation (STI)96 does call for better incentives related to R&D 
expenditure for SMEs and startups, which is a positive development.  
 
The Intellectual Property from Publicly Funded Res earch Act (IPR Act)97 provides protection to inventors 
and universities, but additional regulatory approval and non -exclusive IP assignment into spin -outs has 
resulted in little private sector investment into university developed innovation or government funded 
startups98. The IPR Act applies to any IP (including know -how but excluding copyright in copyrighted 
works) created with public funds through government grants or in a university, or in a science council 
environment. The IPR Act ensures t hat the inventor or creator of the IP and the institution have rights to 
the IP, but also requires the National  IP Management Office (NIPMO) to approve any transaction; thus, 
exclusive or complete assignment of the IP to an entity is difficult. As spin -outs do not own the IP 
outright or because of lengthy approval processes by NIMPO, investor risks regarding IP are increased 
(as well as costs related to deal structuring and legal fees). Owing to scarce successful commercialization  
of university -based IP, th e private sector is hesitant to fund commercialization  or market expansion of 
any company or IP subject to the Act. The DST White Paper on Science Technology and Innovation (STI)14 
also calls for a review of the IPR Act, which is likely to be welcomed in t he industry.  
 
As exchange control approval is required to move, license or assign IP offshore, digital entrepreneurs 
tend to directly register their companies offshore as soon as they start their businesses . Any startup or 
digitally enabled businesses who  wants to trade, operate or raise funding internationally needs reserve 
bank approval and is subject to the Exchange Control (ExCon) Act99, which impacts the way in which it 
manages and exploits its IP. This is significant as IP provides the legal framewor k through which 
companies and research institutions can create, protect and commercialize their research, innovations, 
software and technologies.  The Act restricts South African residents from (among other things) selling, 
assigning or licensing intellect ual property (IP) to foreign residents, and paying royalties to foreign 
residents, without prior approval from the SARB. As a result,  digital entrepreneurs who are building 
scalable, international companies, need to compete globally, and enter into global partnerships, register 
all IP and the main company offshore as soon as they start their business. As a result, tax payable on 
income or exit does not accrue to the country.  Amendments to the ExCon Act state that an authorised 
dealer can approve arms length  transactions or the creation of an offshore company to raise foreign 
funds for operations (subject to conditions) for unlisted SA “technology, media, telecommunications, 
exploration and other R&D companies”. These amendments represent an improvement but 
implementation costs rest with authorised dealers within banks.  
 
Digital startups are unable to claim the Value Added Tax (VAT) they pay when starting their businesses, 
and corporate tax rates are not necessarily adapted to startups. As VAT registration is  only required for 
companies with a turnover of R1 million per annum, many SMEs are unable to claim this early on, thus 
the operating costs on which VAT is paid to vendors are often covered by funding which has been 
secured in exchange for equity. The corp orate tax rate for companies ranges from 0% (below R79 000 
income p.a.) to 28% (from R550 000 income p.a. upwards) regardless of size. Smaller businesses (less

 42 than R1 million per annum) do have the option of paying turnover tax of between 1 - 3% which can  be 
much simpler.  For high growth digital startups however, there is little tax relief for them when they are 
formed or when they are generating profits, at which point they will be taxed in the same bracket as 
corporates.  
 
Labour  related policies and regulations makes digital startups reluctant to hire full -time employees. The 
Labour Relations Act is applicable to all companies operating in SA regardless of size, and startups are 
reluctant to take on the administrative (taxes etc. ) and financial burden of hiring staff too soon. As a 
result many staff at startups are part -time, on short term contracts or consult to the business so that 
they are not seen as formal employees. Thus, startups that have the potential to create further jo bs may 
be hesitant or take longer to do so.   
4.2.2.  Support Organizations  
A large number of support programs and organizations has enabled the development of clusters of 
innovations in specific sectors through dedicated accelerators and sector specific financing . South Africa 
counts 300+ active support organizations for entrepreneurs according to the latest available estimates. 
These notably include service providers such as innovation districts, incubators, accelerator programs, 
innovation hubs, and co -working s paces, as well as event organizers and foundations. Whereas only 10% -
15% of them are thought to target digital entrepreneurs specifically, sector -specific dynamic clusters are 
developing, some attracting substantial foreign and domestic investment with gro wing entrepreneurial 
success, such as Yoco in fintech, HearX in health, GetSmarter in edtech, and Aerobotics in agritech100.  
The impact of organizations’ support on digital business creation, growth and sustainability is however 
limited by insufficient tai loring. First, support is concentrated on the very early - to early -stage spaces of 
business development, with limited funding available and less robust support for later stages; it is also 
concentrated in the affluent urban areas of Gauteng and the Western  Cape, leaving large swathes of 
potential digital entrepreneurs isolated. Second, the quality of services provided by many support 
organizations is considered quite low overall, including due to the lack of relevant mentors and of 
meaningful monitoring and  evaluation processes. And third, growth stage digital acceleration programs 
could be better tailored both to the South African context (longer lead times before reaching the 
fundraising stage) and to facilitate access to markets beyond South Africa.  
The l ong-term financial sustainability and funding of support organizations and programs may become an 
issue. Most of them are highly dependent on the otherwise successful Enterprise and Supplier 
Development program (ESD), which has unlocked ZAR 12 billion (USD  900 million) in capital through 
compulsory contributions from large companies.  
4.2.3.  Financial Capital  
Digital ventures in South Africa face financing gaps throughout most of their lifecycle. The availability of 
finance for digital entrepreneurs in South Africa is generally low (Figure 1 5), in the context of difficult 
access to credit for SMEs overall, with a Getting Credit ranking of 73/190, significantly lower than Kenya 
(8) and Nigeria (12).  
 
100 Detailed case studies of some of these digital startups are included in the Digital entrepreneurship background paper   
 43 Figure 15: Summary of the South Afric an financial capital landscape for digital entrepreneurship at 
various stages  
 
Source: authors  
The South African government has various financing and incentive programs for early stage 
entrepreneurs, but most of these are not suitable for digital entrepreneurs. More than 50 national 
programs targeting SMEs have been identified, with an estimated 2018 financial year budget of about R18 
Bn (of which 48 percent debt finance and 35 percent grants). Most of these programs target very early 
stage busines ses, and only 4 percent target technology SMEs. Minimum trading requirements, cost -
sharing clauses or collateral requirements are among criteria not adapted to digital startups, and there is 
little data on blended finance, most used in many parts of the wo rld. 
Angel investors would be most suited to help fill the early stage funding gap for digital startups; there has 
been more robust growth of later -stage funding through Venture Capital funds, driven by one key piece 
of legislation, but most of this fundin g is not going to digital entrepreneurs, and there are strong 
constraints to further expansion that need to be removed. Angel investors typically contribute more than 
just financial capital to a startup: by being actively involved, mentoring the founding t eam, providing 
strategic or expert advice and introductions to customers etc. Despite the high risk involved, there are 
few incentives to attract them. Angel investor networks could also be supported to increase effectiveness 
for funding digital startups. VC financing on the other hand has seen significant growth in both number 
and value in recent years, reaching 159 deals and R1,16bn in 2017. Amendment of Section 12J of the 
Income Tax act is responsible for the fast increase in new Venture Capital Companie s (VCCs), which has 
resulted in 165101 new VCCs being registered with over R3.4 billion committed by February 2018, with 
 
101South African Revenue Services, 2019. List of Approved Venture Capital Companies  
 
 44 informal estimates that this will reach R5 billion in 2019102. Recent announcements of several large VC 
funds targeting both South Africa n and African startups are expected to further close the finance gap at 
the later stage. However, access might remain an issue for black owned companies with weaker networks 
and expertise, VCCs are restricted to invest into a South African -registered entit y (excluding offshore IP 
and entities) and cannot invest in Fintech by design, and their small size and limited staff capacity are key 
constraints for further growth. This stresses the need to increase the participation of institutional 
investors in local VC funds, as currently the funds are relying on a limited number of high net -worth 
individuals.

4.2.4.  Markets  
South Africa is a growing digital market, notably due to the steady digitization of industries and highly 
sophisticated financial services. The digital market in South Africa is expanding, providing market 
opportunities for existing and new digital busines ses. From 2016 to 2018, smartphone penetration grew 
almost twofold to 81.7%, and fixed broadband subscriptions around fourfold to 7.5 million. Transactions 
are conducted more and more digitally. These developments have helped the creation of new business 
models and services locally, while major global digital platform actors such as Uber and AirBnb have used 
South Africa as an entry point. The steady digitization of industries and the high level of sophistication in 
banking and financial services have also been encouraging the growth of Business -to-Business (B2B) digital 
products and services. Lastly, policy efforts to support opportunities for digital entrepreneurs, especially 
from previously disadvantaged communities (e.g. through B -BBEE and ESD), and to a dopt digital 
technologies (e -governance), are further market levers.  
E-commerce and digital private platforms are an expanding segment of the digital entrepreneurship 
landscape, but limited information exists as of yet  analyzing their role and impact.  It is estimated that 
private platforms currently have close to 1.3M workers in South Africa103 and revenue in the e -commerce 
market is estimated at around US$3bn in 2019, with annual growth rates projected of around 10% pe r 
annum. with the usage of digital channels for transactions growing accordingly104. South Africa rates 
better in UNCTAD’s E -commerce Index compared to Kenya, Nigeria and Senegal (Table 2). This has 
attracted investments into new business models and service s including digital platforms such as 
SweepSouth, Takealot, and Parcel Ninja (see case studies in digital entrepreneurship background paper). 
Also, some of the largest global digital platforms are using South Africa as an entry point to the continent, 
including Uber which launched operations in 2013, Netflix in 2016, Spotify in 2018, and Airbnb. Challenges 
faced by digital private platforms mirror those already outlined for digital entrepreneurs, with an

104 For example, according to Global Findex, between 2014 and 2017, the % adults who used the Internet to pay bills or to buy som ething online 
in the past  year grew from 7.62% to 14.13%. https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/   
 45 emphasis in areas such as data privacy and cybersecur ity. E -commerce is dampened by restrictions on 
trading history and costs (3 -4% of a transaction) for processing online payments, persistent logistics costs 
and issues, and some import restrictions.  
Overall, market growth and access could still be signific antly improved by improving data access and 
shortening payment cycles. The high cost of broadband data remains a challenge for most South Africans, 
penalizing key potential growth segments in the digital sector. Long procurement and payment cycles with 
business buyers also disadvantage smaller, younger, or less well funded players. Government efforts to 
develop e -services for businesses have only translated into timid actions and results so far, although South 
Africa is still a leader on the continent, and small businesses find it very challenging currently to win 
government contracts. Finally, ICT services exports data still show limited global reach while the local 
market remains limited compared to richer countries outside the continent, despite some succ esses, also 
due to infrastructure and persistent inequalities.

4.2.5.  Entrepreneurship Culture and Talent  
The perception of entrepreneurial culture in South Africa is on the rise and quite positive overall, helped 
by a recent increase in high profile business exits by local digital entrepreneurs, but remains suboptimal 
due to insufficient collaboration and div ersity. Strong startup communities host an abundance of 
networking events, talks and workshops, which help inspire, and train new entrepreneurs. There is 
growing participation of previously disadvantaged individuals, and more businesses target disadvantage d 
communities, with positive social impact. However, the digital entrepreneurship sector remains 
overwhelmingly white, male, and middle class, even though public and private initiatives such as B -BBEE 
and dedicated women -led angel investment networks are s tarting to bridge some gaps. Collaboration 
between organizations across the ecosystem remains limited, for example between the largest hubs in 
Western Cape and Gauteng, in spite of strong complementarities.  
Limited supply of digital talent remains a key w eakness of the South African digital entrepreneurship 
ecosystem. The paucity of talent is a significant and acute problem at all skill levels, not helped by South 
Africa’s full bottom rank (139/139) in terms of quality of Math and Science education accordi ng to the 
World Bank. Rapid skills programs with promising results have emerged but have faced funding and 
accreditation issues. The competition for higher -end talent is especially fierce in the corporate sector at 
large, further exacerbated by current Sou th African visa requirements on the one hand, and foreign 
initiatives to drain talent such as the French Tech visa – which makes talent needed for (global) growth 
unaffordable for most digital entrepreneurs – on the other hand.

4.3. RECOMMENDATIONS AND NEXT STEPS 
Clarifying the Regulatory and Policy Frameworks for Digital Entrepreneurship  
Identifying and prioritizing a set of digital entrepreneurship policies with clear department leadership 
would facilitate the growth of digital entrepreneurship. Building on the national 4iR initiative, reviewing 
existing instruments and p olicies (through for example a public expenditure review, which could 
investigate the impact of different existing policy instruments) and developing a comprehensive and 
consistent set of policies such as done by the Irish government or others105 would help  develop the sector. 
Strengthening M&E mechanisms of existing policies would better inform both the public and private 
sectors on the impact and utility of different instruments and accelerate the scaling -up of successful 
initiatives.  
Reforming certain as pects of the business environment to make it more digital entrepreneur friendly 
would also unlock sectoral growth and job creation. Amending exchange control requirements and 
processes relating to IP as well as foreign investment into, and sale of, domesti c companies would help 
keep growing digital companies anchored in South Africa. Enabling digital startups to defer R&D tax breaks 
against taxable income up to 3 years, such as done in Australia, would allow them to fully benefit from 
further engaging in in novative research. Easing labor legislation for employees in young digital companies 
could drive employment growth further in the sector. Lastly, reforming regulations to allow IP to be fully 
assigned to spin out companies could increase private sector inv estment into university -developed 
innovation or government funded startups.  
Further Strengthening the Digital Entrepreneurship Ecosystem  
Increasing the quality and quantity of available digital skills through both long -term investment and 
shorter -term act ions is crucial to continued growth. The paucity of digital skills is a key and acute 
constraint to the growth of digital entrepreneurship, and more broadly the digital economy. In the short 
run, scaling out existing successful programs such as the Digital  Skills Academy or mLabs Southern Africa 
and other PPPs, could go part of the way to bridging the gap in general and digital skills. Furthermore, 
facilitating the coming into the country of foreign highly skilled digital entrepreneurs or professionals 
thro ugh “tech visas” such as done in France, could also positively impact the sector by bolstering the 
creation of new companies and the mentoring of South African entrepreneurs.  
Quality of support provided to entrepreneurs could also be improved, including fo r better inclusion, scale, 
and access to foreign markets boosted. Results -based funding is an effective way to improve services 
quality, especially at the critical ideation and seed stages. Strengthening linkages between Gauteng and 
Western Cape ecosystems  and continuing to address the rural/urban divide can improve learning,

countries currently exploring Acts or legislative  tools for startups.   
 47 inclusion, and scale, and help build out regional and pan -African programs for later stage digital 
entrepreneurs to increase access to international markets and mentors.  
Expanding Access to Funding  
Increasing incentives for angel investors and supporting the structuring of angel networks is critical to 
drive investment into early -stage digital businesses. In line with what was implemented for VC funds 
through section 12J, incentives ought to be increased to encourage early stage investments in digital 
entrepreneurs. Angel investors typically provide additional support in terms of mentorship, experience, 
and networks, beyond the capital invested. Effective schemes implemente d elsewhere such as the UK 
Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) and Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS) could usefully be 
replicated or adapted. Also, supporting the setup and structuring of angel networks has proven 
instrumental in raising the number a nd enhancing the quality of angel investors.  
De-risking investment could be usefully part of financing schemes for early -stage digital entrepreneurs. 
De-risking mechanisms targeted to digital entrepreneurs, including through blended finance by 
governments and intergovernmental agencies on the model of the CORFO program in Chile, which has a 
successful blended finance mechanism, could encourage an increase in the availability of early stage funds 
for digital entrepreneurs.  
Continuing Active Support to Diversity in Digital Entrepreneurship  
Active support to diversity in the digital entrepreneurship sector should be continued. Significant strides 
have been made in encouraging previously disadvantaged communities to break into and succeed in 
digital entrep reneurship, notably through the B -BBEE legislation, which has given both a financial 
incentive and access to markets for these communities. The number of women in the sector, and in digital 
entrepreneurship more specifically, remains however low. Notwithst anding a number of skills training 
and upgrading programs, it would be useful to further incentivize support organizations to increase 
tailored support provided to women and black -led digital businesses. Examples of programs could include 
DigitalUndivided and Project Diane, in the US, for diversity, and She Starts, Australia and We In Social Tech, 
in the UK, for women.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 48 5. DIGITAL  SKILLS  
 
6.1. BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE OF DIGITAL SKILLS 
Foundational for a digital economy to flourish, developing a digitally competent workforce and digitally 
literate citizens who can reap the benefits that the digital society brings will greatly help South Africa’s 
digital economy development.  
In the absence of an African framework for digital skills dev elopment, this chapter draws from existing 
frameworks to conceptualize digital skills. The Digital Skills Pyramid used by the World Bank broadly 
groups digital skills into three layers: Digital user skills; Digital specialist skills; and e -Business skills.  Digital 
user skills include those necessary for users of digital platforms, software, or devices. For everyone to 
participate in a digital economy, it is essential that all citizens have the opportunity to develop digital 
literacy skills that allow them t o live, work, learn, and participate in a modern society. Digital specialist 
skills are those needed to produce digital software and hardware, design and maintain systems, and 
conduct research. E -business skills are those associated with digital entreprene urship, creating innovative 
business models, and marketing of digital products and services. Another example is the European Union, 
which suggested a more comprehensive framework, the DigComp 2.0106. This framework identifies five 
areas of competences with 21 specific competences: information and data literacy, communication and 
collaboration, digital content creation, safety and problem solving. More recently, UNESCO added two 
more competences to the DigComp 2.0 framework, to include competences related to devices and 
software operations, and career related competencies.  
South Africa recognizes the potentially significant impact a digital economy could have on its economic 
growth and its citizens’ development. Moreover, the country recognizes the foundation al role that digital 
skills play in building such an economy.  
South Africa has a well -developed policy landscape that guides skills development: The Skills Development 
Act of 1998 set in motion development of various policy documents from different governm ent 
departments in response to the urgent need to rectify past injustices of racial exclusion, as well as catering 
to the needs of a newly formed and growing democracy. Unfortunately, until very recently, these 
departments seldom collaborated, and policy d ocuments were developed in isolation.  
There is recognition of the importance of digital skills from the highest governing levels: the President 
officially recognized the importance of digital skills in 2002. For the next two decades, several policies, 
strategies, plans and interventions on national and provincial levels were developed and implemented to 
address infrastructure, resources, and to create opportunities for youth. These efforts were laudable, but 
largely uncoordinated. Recent international calls  for countries to prepare for the 4iR gave rise to renewed 
recognition of the importance of technology and digital skills for a growing economy in South Africa. This 
has led to the establishment of the Presidential Commission on the 4iR, as well as other c ommitments, 
such as the radical technological transformation of the schooling system within the next six years. The 
Commission should tie together the work that has been done by different departments and lead a 
collective and more coordinated effort toward s digital skills development.  
 
106 EU DigComp 2.0: The Digital Competence Framework for Citizens.  https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/digcomp/digital -competence -framework   
 49 Research informs policy and practice in digital skills development. Different large -scale research projects 
related to digital skills development or the broader 4iR developments are taking place. The DTPS is 
conducting environ mental scans to determine the extent of digital skills development needs among the 
general population, organizations, and government. This also implies monitoring and evaluation to track 
development over time, as well as a sense of accountability flowing f rom that knowledge. The DHET 
conducts biennial research to identify the occupations in highest demand to guide institutions to adapt to 
changing needs. The 2018 list included 25 ICT -related occupations in high demand. Finally, the DST is 
leading research r elated to 4iR developments.  
South Africa has extensive unused human capital on which it can draw. The country ranks 126th out of 157 
countries on the Human Capital Index, which is far below what would be expected from its per capita 
income level. To some e xtent, this can be attributed to the poor quality of schooling and persistent 
resource and race -based inequalities in education. Combined with a ‘Not in Education, Employment, or 
Training’ (NEET) rate of over 30%, low labor market participation (55%), yout h representing almost two 
thirds of the unemployed, and an underqualified workforce (20% with tertiary qualification, 32% with 
secondary education and almost half of the workforce not having a grade 12 certificate), there is much 
unused potential to develo p. 
There are some good examples of collaboration taking place: Public -private collaborations, particularly 
between provincial governments and universities (as public entities) and private institutions are 
increasing. In addition, several initiatives, rangi ng from programs to empower youth with ICT skills, to 
embedding digital skills in all forms of education and everyday life, are taking place under leadership of 
provincial governments or private companies.  
There is a variety of qualifications on offer: var ious public and private providers are offering a range of 
different courses and using different models of learning (e.g. online tutoring, face -to-face sessions, peer 
learning, mentoring, boot camps, etc.). These courses also vary in duration, cost, and whe ther the 
outcome of the course results in an accredited qualification, certification, or possible placement in partner 
companies.  
South Africans are slowly getting connected: many South Africans are engaging with social media, and 
predominantly through mob ile technology, while the drive to get all citizens (and schools in particular) 
connected to the internet is progressing well.  
6.2. DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS : CURRENT STATE OF DIGITAL SKILLS 
Inadequate and Insufficient Supply of Digital Skills: South Africa ranks 116th out of 140 countries in the 
Global Competitiveness Report’s assessment of digital skills among the population (3.5 out of 7)107. 
Contributing factors might include limited access to digital devices or the internet, low production of ICT 
graduates from th e formal post -school sector, and the slow pace of adoption of formal ICT curricula with 
rapid developments in the field. Because they do not have key skills available from potential employees, 
companies miss out on innovation opportunities108. In the privat e sector, many shorter courses or coding

108 PWC annual CEO survey. 2019.   
 50 boot camps focus on producing large numbers of qualifications, yet candidates only receive three or four 
months of coding training, which might not be enough. Adequate practical experience is important.  
6.2.1.  Digital Literacy  
Specific digital skills need to be identified within the levels of digital skills. DTPS has made considerable 
progress in conceptualizing digital skills, establishing the iKamva National e -Skills Institute (iNeSI), and 
initiating environmental sca ns to determine the need for digital skills among the broader public, in 
organizations, and within government. The DTPS is also in the process of developing a digital skills strategy 
that will inform a national approach to developing such skills.  
Digital skills development in schools still has a long way to go. There are still major gaps in access to devices 
and connectivity in schools, as well as concerns about teacher training in effective technology use. To 
date, around 34% of schools have a computer la boratory and almost 70% have some form of access to 
internet. While the Department of Basic Education (DBE) uses several partners to provide teachers 
resources and technical skills to use technology in teaching, the training is sporadic and not universally  
standardized. Such training is also criticized by educational technologists because it mainly focuses on 
technological skills training and does not teach teachers to embed technology into teaching practices to 
enhance learning. Moreover, there seems to be  a lack of a collective understanding of what digital skills 
entail and whether they should be introduced as stand -alone curricula in school or embedded throughout 
the broader curriculum.  
The quality of basic education remains a key constraint for the Sout h African education and training 
system and labor market.109 Central to these quality concerns are learners’ low literacy levels and 
underperformance in mathematics. Moreover, there do not seem to be clear pathways between school -
level and post -school educa tion in ICT -related subjects. Very few learners also have access to ICT electives 
from Grade 10 because of lack of infrastructure, resources, or teachers. Limiting opportunities for learners 
to engage with technology provides a partial explanation of under use of the human capital potential that 
the country has, particularly among the less advantaged youth. It also contributes to criticisms from the 
private sector that learners are not developing the skills they need to enter into the workplace or to 
pursue further studies. For example, the quality of Mathematics education is ranked 128th out of 137 
countries in the WEF Global Competitiveness Ranking110. Further, of the 800,843 learners who wrote the 
National Senior Certificate examination in 2018, 172,043 (21 %) obtained a bachelor’s pass and only 58% 
passed Mathematics with a score higher than 30%.  
6.2.2.  Professional Digital Skills  
 The production of post -school graduates does not meet labor market demands. The low number and 
quality of graduates produced by both TVET Colleges and higher education institutions does not meet the 
demand of the sector. For example, close to 3,000 vacanc ies exist in the top 10 most -difficult -to-fill ICT 
positions111. In contrast, fewer than 7,000 students graduated in 2016 with general ICT -related degrees.  
In addition, students enrolling for ICT -related degrees in higher education are not graduating. Of th e 
students enrolled in 2014 for undergraduate diplomas/certificates and three -year bachelor’s degrees in

 51 ICT, only 14%, and 13% respectively completed their qualifications in 2016112. In general, the percentage 
of students who enroll for three -year ICT degr ees and graduate after six years in the system is 41%.113 
Curricula are not responding fast enough to meet rapid changes in demand. TVET Colleges and universities 
are criticized for having outdated curricula, and not being responsive enough to fast -changing  skills 
demands.  
A lack of coherent, national leadership and collaboration leads to lack of coherence in institutional 
offerings. On a national level, the slow pace of responding to digital skills needs is a concern. For example, 
since the first official f ocus on developing digital skills in 2002, several policies, strategies, plans, and 
initiatives have been developed and implemented. However, due to lack of coherent coordination 
between departments and the variety of other important skills that need to be  developed as a matter of 
urgency, collective recognition of the importance of digital skills is only resurfacing now. Further, the lack 
of coherent focus on how the digital economy is developing has resulted in only pockets of innovation in 
partnerships o r degree offerings. For example, eleven universities in the country are offering programs 
and modules in 4iR and related fields of artificial intelligence and robotics114. However, no real collective 
efforts to link qualification offerings with emerging and  changing job demands have surfaced.  
6.2.3.  e-Business Skills  
Only some universities are recognizing the link between entrepreneurship, business, and ICT skills. Some 
have made ICT degrees more flexible to include business subjects as electives, while others have  included 
ICT subjects as electives into commerce faculties. However, these changes are not systemic and only 
selected institutions are responding to the need to develop entrepreneurial and business skills with ICT 
skills.   
6.3. RECOMMENDATIONS AND NEXT STEPS 
Coordinate the conceptualization and implementation of the different levels of digital skills. A coordinated 
effort between the different governmental departments including DTPS, DHET, National Skills Authority 
(NSA), DBE, and provinces is needed to build on the work that has been done, and to identify which specific 
skills in each of the three levels need to be developed. Policy guidance that clarify conceptual needs will 
lay the foundation for practical interventions. Realistic policies are also needed to  guide the technological 
transformations envisioned for the country, to guide how digital skills should be implemented at scale to 
reach all citizens and empower those who are unemployed or undereducated. These policies should 
emphasize quality, accountabi lity, and monitoring and evaluation.  
Make use of educational platforms, such as Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) 
colleges and Community Colleges, to develop digital literacy in unemployed youth. Many learners do not 
complete schooling , do not have funds for further education, and end up unemployed or in low -paying, 
informal employment. Digital literacy development should not be limited to schools; it could also be made

 52 available to the broader public through partnerships with TVET and Community Colleges, as well as private 
sector initiatives to make sure everyone is included in digital skills development.  
Define clear developmental pathways between schooling and post -school education and training. While 
all South Africans should be educ ated to be digitally literate, there should be clear pathways aligning basic 
skills development with more sophisticated professional pathways. The identification of skills needed for 
emerging interdisciplinary job demands should underpin the options learne rs have.  
Explore innovative ways of including digital skills in the wider curriculum and to scale up private -sector 
led initiatives. The process of developing, aligning, testing, training, and implementing new formal 
curricula (in schools and post -school i nstitutions) is too lengthy to be responsive to the fast -changing 
demand. Innovative ways of training through partnerships (public/private, inter -sectoral, intra -sectoral, 
regional, and so on) should be considered as part of meeting this need. South Africa  has no shortage of 
private -sector initiated models for rapid digital skills development, which may be scaled up through PPPs.  
Equity of access to resources should be foregrounded. The persistent inequalities of the education system 
will not be rectified i f only urban and well -resourced schools have access to good teaching, smart 
classrooms, computers, internet, and a wider selection of subjects from which to choose. Additional 
opportunities through external partnerships should be made available to learners , teachers, schools and 
institutions from rural or disadvantaged areas.  
Emphasize formalized teacher training in general, as well as use of technology to enhance learning. This 
goes beyond showing teachers how technology works. Partnerships with educationa l technology 
consultants and closer collaboration with teacher training centers and universities to align formal teacher 
education with the technological revolution envisioned in schools is very important.  
Implement post -school curriculum reform pertaining  to qualifications related to professional digital skills. 
Innovative ways of speeding up the responsiveness of formal qualifications to the needs of the labor 
market should be explored and developed. Examples of partnerships between public and private sec tors 
show great potential to help in this regard.  
DHET, DTPS and SETAs could play a larger role in identifying cross -sectoral professional digital skills and 
providing guidance to develop interdisciplinary skills. The DHET and NSA could also provide more g uidance 
to post -school institutions to align their curricula (the skills and knowledge being developed) with labor 
market needs beyond the jobs -in-demand list. For example, incorporating the range of cognitive and 
socio -emotional skills that are emerging a s in demand for the field. Such efforts will widen the reach of 
professional digital skills in other disciplines. Innovations using technology to enhance advancements in 
disciplines such as agriculture, health, or manufacturing all need professional digita l skills. Having 
professional digital skills combined with disciplinary knowledge enables translation between technology 
and contextual needs. Innovative ways of creating opportunities for students in these disciplines to 
engage in professional digital ski lls could make significant contributions to the digital development of 
disciplines.  
Increase the number and the quality of IT graduates: The poor throughput of students enrolled for ICT 
degrees should be investigated to identify where the problem lies. For  example, it could be that the 
articulation gap is too wide for students to adjust to university curricula, students might not find the  
 53 content relevant for the work they want to pursue, or they might even find faster alternatives to reach 
the same level o f competence and drop out.  
Formalize the entrepreneurial link between ICT and business studies within and beyond higher education. 
The trend of merging ICT subjects with business degrees or vice versa could be broadened and 
incorporated into qualifications  offered by TVET Colleges and the MICT SETA. Curricula could also be 
reviewed to optimize the relevance of complementary subjects to enhance entrepreneurship, for 
example, including digital entrepreneurship in the development of innovative business models,  or 
including the marketing of digital products and services in marketing degrees.  
Innovative ways of including e -business skills in curricula or short courses are needed. A flourishing digital 
economy needs more than users, developers, and maintenance of technology. It requires 
entrepreneurship and innovation to expand the delivery of p roducts and services. Therefore, innovative 
ways to enhance entrepreneurship and innovation need to be in place, some of which might include: 
flexible curriculum structures in ICT or business degrees; reviewing the relevance of curriculum content; 
tying st artup funding to hybrid degree completion; and investing in public -private partnerships through 
which students could gain business experience or engage in short courses to develop business (or ICT) 
skills.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 54 7. CONCLUSION : A WAY FORWAR D 
 
Globally, the digital economy has become an important driver of economic growth, innovation, and 
improved service delivery. This is also true for South Africa.  Digitalization is revolutionizing how people 
bank, travel, access health care services, access public services, and do business. The number of internet 
users worldwide tripled from 1 billion in 2005 to 3.2 billion in 2015. The contribution of the digital 
economy is expected to grow from 15.5 percent to a quarter of global GDP betwee n 2016 and 2026. Every 
dollar invested in ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2018 is estimated could yield USD 5 by 2025. ICT 
is outperforming several sectors in South Africa, and already contributes around 17 percent of service 
exports and close to 3 per cent of GDP (currently more than the contribution of agriculture)115. Internet 
penetration in South Africa is the highest in Sub -Saharan Africa at 54 percent, smartphone penetration is 
high at 81 percent, and the country remains ahead of regional peers in the Global Competitiveness Index, 
notwithstanding growing competition from the likes of Tunisia, Kenya, Egypt, Nigeria, and Mauritius; 
emerging markets such as Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, and India are still ahead.116  
The diagnostic findings show much promise for improved continental leadership on the digital economy 
agenda but  highlight the need to speed up implementation on many fronts for all South Africans to 
benefit. This is in particular the case in digital infrastructure and skills, where there is an urg ency to push 
forward key reforms and stimulate private investments to address key challenges. Fast tracking 
implementation of digital public platforms will be important for improving service delivery and driving up 
demand for digital services, including th e development of a next -generation digital identity system to help 
provide trust to underpin online transactions in South Africa’s growing digital economy. Regarding digital 
entrepreneurship and financial services, South Africa needs to play to its strengt hs, working on incentives 
and regulations for improved growth.  
Starting with infrastructure, South Africa should further enable private investment by working to improve 
the policy and regulatory environment. Competition in the broadband market needs to be  enhanced, 
while alleviating concerns around mobile spectrum capacity and improving network performance. 
Promoting rural connectivity and more affordable data prices should continue to be priorities, alongside 
stimulating growth in high -speed fixed -line ad option.  To address fragmentation and improve 
coordination, South Africa should urgently consider updating its national broadband policy with realistic 
targets and implementation models based on international best practices. The country should ensure the 
independence and capacity of the regulator, fast -track 4G  licensing , enforce stricter rules on infrastructure 
sharing, and reconsider its universal access fund model. This would return South Africa to a path towards 
universal internet access, in turn leadin g to investment in other segments of the digital economy.  
Reforms to develop digital public platforms should be stepped up. The implementation of national and 
provincial digital government strategies needs to be adequately resourced, for instance through private 
participation. To reduce fragmentation and proliferation, government should also improve the 
coordination and communication among Departments, SOEs and agencies driving this agenda, clarifying 
the role of each player at the national level. Leveragi ng the asset of a very strong foundational ID system 
South Africa could build a next generation digital ID system that allows South Africa to participate in the 
global digital economy (Europe’s eIDAS for example). Finally, the government needs to take a ho listic view 
of interoperability challenges, by defining a set of interdisciplinary measures required for further data 
sharing and openness, and appointing a central entity that will take stock, monitor and evaluate the 
development of digital government ser vices.

116 World Economic Forum (2018) Global Competitiveness Report   
 55 Key recommendations regarding digital financial services center around increasing the usage of these 
platforms. South Africa should lower the barriers on access to retail payment systems and support the 
development of the fintech sector. Other key  recommendations to consider on the supply -side include 
promoting regulation mandating open, interoperable and interconnected systems and products, so as to 
enhance efficiency and expand usage. These efforts would leverage on some of recent demand -side 
interventions such as the establishment of the market conduct authority, expected to improve consumer 
trust in digital financial services. Policy makers should also encourage alternative sources of, and means 
of assessing, credit, particularly for informal bu sinesses. Leveraging the large volume of recurrent 
payments could expand usage of accounts, particularly within the low -income consumer segment.  
A number of reforms are also needed to realize the potential of South Africa’s promising digital 
entrepreneursh ip ecosystem. The government should strengthen the business environment for digital 
entrepreneurs through policies and regulations addressing constraints such as exchange controls, unclear 
Intellectual Property assignment, ill -targeted R&D tax breaks, limi tations affecting digital payments for e -
commerce businesses, and insufficient labor flexibility for young digital firms. In addition to strengthening 
e-business skills, the government could also consider introducing a tech visa allowing for the easy sourc ing 
of skills. Finally, to scale up and reach global markets, South African digital entrepreneurs need expanded 
funding; this could be provided through de -risking mechanisms, as well as the setting up of supporting 
networks and incentives for angel investo rs.  
Weaknesses in terms of skills need to be addressed to unlock investment into other segments. As it stands, 
South Africa is already experiencing an exodus of ICT skills. While tackling weaknesses stemming from the 
low quality of education is a long -term agenda,  a number of reforms such as better coordination of the 
conceptualization and implementation of the different levels of digital skills, greater utilization of 
educational platforms, such as Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) c olleges and 
Community Colleges, the clarification of developmental pathways between schooling and post -school 
education, and the design of training informed by industry demands, could yield significant short -term 
outcomes. The fast -changing nature of the I CT sectors argues for setting up private participation in rolling 
out relevant digital resources in schools and reforming curricula so as to keep it relevant to industry needs. 
Such reforms to curricula should include formal e -business studies to prepare S outh Africa’s digital 
entrepreneurs.  
Overall, in order to unleash further benefits from the digital economy, South Africa would benefit from a 
holistic approach to address the constraints affecting the DE4A pillars, including strong public sector 
engageme nt that could enable further private participation. The new Presidential Commission for the 4th 
Industrial Revolution could become an important coordination forum in this respect. Efforts to establish 
common policy orientations and improve internal coordin ation between government departments and 
key agencies, as well as the monitoring and evaluation of existing policies would be beneficial. The private 
sector has a key role to play in South A frica’s digital economy, highlighting the importance of improved 
dialogue between the government and private operators on prevailing digital challenges. With current 
fiscal challenges in particular, the government should increasingly adopt an enabling role, leveraging 
private sector expertise and facilitating increased p rivate sector participation in delivering on public policy 
objectives under all foundational pillars of the digital economy.    
 56 ANNEX 1: TABLE  OF RECOMMENDATIONS  
 
Element  Key recommendations include  
Digital 
infrastructure  
 
Fast, high -quality 
and affordable 
broadband internet 
is a key foundation 
of the digital 
economy.  
 ● Update the national broadband policy with realistic targets and implementation models 
based on international best practice. Instead of continuing to rely on SOEs as 
implementation vehicles for SA Connect, the Government could use its anchor role on the 
market more proactively, by aggregating its demand for connectivity and have this delivered 
through bulk procurements.  
● Ensuring ICASA’s independence and capacit y under the new merged national department is 
key. The regulator needs clear mandate confirming its field of play, to help alleviate concerns 
around its independence and expedite stalled actions such as 4G licensing . 
● Prioritize fast -tracking spectrum assignment for 4G use  to increase network capacity and 
alleviate constraint that the operators currently face and to take a proactive stance towards 
5G licensing. The government could implement spectrum caps or spectrum se t aside as part 
of the auction process to encourage market entry by operators with lower access to capital 
or set more demanding coverage requirements for existing MNOs  
● If the Government proceeds with the WOAN and introduces it again as part of the ECA 
Ame ndment Bill, there needs to be careful consideration of the model to avoid monopolistic 
outcomes in the wholesale market, maximize private investment and ensure continued 
incentives to innovate.  
● Make efforts to encourage further positive developments in th e fixed -line broadband 
market. Promotion of infrastructure sharing, pro -competition open access principles, 
implementation of transparent wholesale pricing  and determination of regulatory remedies 
could help the market grow.  
Digital platforms  
 
Platforms enable 
public and private 
sector 
organizations to 
devise new or 
better outcomes for 
citizens.  
 ● Improve coordination and communication among Departments and Agencies driving this 
agenda at the national level. important for the center of governmen t to clarify the specific role 
of each key entity involved in the digital government at the national level, drawing from 
international best practices.  
● Adequately resource the implementation of the national and provincial digital government 
strategies. Revi ew the available resources at both the national and provincial level. If a budget 
shortfall is indeed identified, then fostering public -private partnerships could be one of the 
possible solutions.  
● Taking a holistic view of interoperability challenges to re move some of the existing 
bottlenecks. Review the legal and regulatory review  to ensure that the Departments and 
Agencies are legally allowed to share data, push mainstream APIs to ensure that the databases 
of various Departments and Agencies can communic ate with each other on a selective as -
needed basis, and implement a change management strategy to target behavioral constraints 
for further data sharing and openness.  
● Improve digital capacity within public sector by rethinking the offerings of government 
training institutions such as the National School of Government (also under DPSA).  
● Monitoring and evaluate the development of digital services to improve their efficiency, cost -
effectiveness, and citizen -centricity.  This will avoid duplication and will aid  in further 
improvement and efficiency of e -services.  Eventually, it will also help to make digital service 
delivery more citizen -centric.  
Digital financial 
services  ● Reduce barriers on access to retail payment systems. Amend the legislation to (i) enable access 
to the NPS to all licensed/authorized entities either th rough a direct or indirect membership  
 57  
Individuals and 
households need 
convenient and 
affordable channels 
by which to pay, 
save, and borrow.  
 and (ii) recognizing payments as an activity distinct from deposit taking. Review the current 
policy on limiting the issuance of e -money products to only bank.  
● Promote open, interoperable and interconnected systems and  products to expand usage. 
SARB needs to develop and issue regulation mandating interoperability and adoption of open 
standards to enable existing closed -loop systems to become open -loop systems or to be able 
to become interoperable with the open loop syst ems.  
● Improve consumer trust in digital financial services by using the market conduct authority to 
develop product standards covering digital financial products and introduce simple complaint 
handling procedures and redress mechanism for users of digital f inancial services that are 
currently lacking. In addition, review of KYC thresholds.  
● Leverage the large volume recurrent retail payments to expand usage particularly within the 
low-income consumer segment by promoting convenient and affordable use of SASSA  account 
at low or no cost could help increase the usage of accounts and its electronic payment 
features.  
Digital 
entrepreneurship  
 
A pool of 
supported, skilled 
entrepreneurs leads 
to new products, 
services, business 
models, markets, 
and jobs.  ● Identify and prioritize a set of digital entrepreneurship policies with clear department 
leadership. Building on the national 4iR initiative, review existing instruments and policies, and 
develop a comprehensive and consistent set of policies  (grouped unde r a policy statement  
such as done by the Irish government or others ) would help develop the sector.  
● Reform certain aspects of the business environment to make it more digital entrepreneur 
friendly. Amend exchange control requirements and processes relating  to IP as well as foreign 
investment into domestic companies, enable digital startups to defer R&D tax breaks against 
taxable income, ease labor legislation in young digital companies and reform regulations to 
allow IP to be fully assigned to spin out comp anies.  
● Improve the quality of support provided to entrepreneurs, including for better inclusion, scale, 
and access to foreign markets boosted. Use results -based funding, strengthen linkages 
between Gauteng and Western Cape ecosystems and continue to addres s the rural/urban 
divide to improve learning, inclusion, and scale, and help build out regional programs for later 
stage digital entrepreneurs to better access international markets and mentors.  
● Increase incentives for angel investors and supporting the st ructuring of angel networks is 
critical to drive investment into early -stage digital businesses, drawing on section 12J and 
international best practice.  
● De-risk investment targeted to digital early -stage entrepreneurs, including through blended 
finance by governments and intergovernmental agencies on the model of the CORFO program 
in Chile.  
● Continue  active support to foster more diversity in the digital entrepreneurship sector, 
including through incentivizing support organizations to increase tailored suppo rt provided to 
women and black -led digital businesses drawing on international best practices.  
Digital skills  
 
The development of 
a vibrant, dynamic, 
and inclusive digital 
economy requires a 
deep labor pool.  
 ● Coordinate the conceptualization and implementation of the different levels of digital skills to 
build on the work that has been done, and to identify which specific skills in each of the three 
levels need to be developed.  
● Develop digital literacy in unemployed youth by making use of educational platforms such as 
Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) colleges and Community Colleges.  
● Define c lear developmental pathways between schooling and post -school education and 
training. The identification of skills needed for emerging interdisciplinary job demands should 
underpin the options learners have.   
 58 ● Explore innovative ways of including digital ski lls in the wider curriculum and to scale up 
private -sector led initiatives. Leverage and scale -up private -sector initiated models for rapid 
digital skills development through PPPs.  
● Foreground equity of access to resources. Additional opportunities through external 
partnerships should be made available to learners, teachers, schools and institutions from 
rural or disadvantaged areas.  
● Emphasize formalized teacher training in general, as well as use of technology to enhance 
learning, including through partners hips with educational technology consultants and closer 
collaboration with teacher training centers and universities.  
● Implement post -school curriculum reform pertaining to qualifications related to professional 
digital skills. Examples of partnerships betw een public and private sectors show great potential 
to help in this regard.  
● DHET, DTPS and SETAs could play a larger role in identifying cross -sectoral professional digital 
skills and providing guidance to develop interdisciplinary skills.  
● Increase the nu mber and the quality of IT graduates by investigating where the problem lies 
in the poor throughput of students enrolled for ICT degrees.  
● Formalize the entrepreneurial link between ICT and business studies within and beyond higher 
education, including by b roadening the trend of merging ICT subjects with business degrees 
or vice versa.
