Background  
While Niger has made some progress on reproductive health 
and nutrition outcomes, there has been limited movement on 
key indicators. The fertility rate in Niger (about 7 births per 
woman) is among the highest in Sub -Saharan Africa . The 
proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel 
increased modestly from 2012 to 2015 (from 29%i to 39%ii).

Modern contraceptive use for all women has increased from  
12% in 2012iii to 15% in 2017iv. And about 42%v of children 
under five are a ffected by stunting due to poor feeding 
practices. The weak empower ment of women, and the low 
quality and utilization of Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, 
Child and  Adolescent Health and Nutrition (RMNCAH + N)  
services  are among the biggest challenges. The  coverage of

The Ministry of Public Health (MOH) in Niger has used Rapid Results Initiatives  (RRIs) to achieve targets for 
reproductive health and nutrition. Key outcomes of this approach include:  
 
• Mobilization of regions and districts to overcome constraints to assisted deliveries, family planning (FP), 
nutritional counseling and measles vaccina tion, and thus achieve Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs).  
• Collaboratively planned provision of mobile  health services, door -to-door visits and outreach to remote and 
underserved areas, by health teams and communities.  
• Engagement of local leaders to he lp health centers increase coverage of services to women and children, 
including mapping of households wit h low uptake of health services; implementing social sanctions to reduce 
home births.  
• Inclusion of FP and assisted deliveries and other messages on re productive health and nutrition in sermons of 
religious leaders.  
 
The Government of Niger has rated RRI as  one of the top innovations in its national health plan. The MOH and the 
regions are bound by annual performance contracts to improve results using RR Is.

services is an obstacle, considering that 83%vi of the  
population lives in rural areas.  
 
In late 2015, the MOH launched the Population and Health 
Support Project (PHSP), anchored in Niger’s National Health 
Development Plan (2011 -2015 and 2017 -2021). It improved 
services in health centers and community interv entions in 
five regions (Dosso, Maradi, Tahoua, Tillaberi and Zinder). 
The MOH receives payment for results achieved against 
DLIs, which are validated annually.  
 
This brief focuses on five D LIs addressed by the project:  1) 
number of women between 15 -49 uti lizing modern 
contraceptive methods; 2) adolescents under the age of 20 
utilizing modern contraceptive methods; 3) number of births 
delivered by a trained health professional; 4) infants hav ing 
received nutrition counselling and an updated growth chart; 
and 5) number of children under five vaccinated against 
measles .  
 
The main mechanism of support in districts has been RRIs , 
which are an action -learning initiative that support teams to 
test new innovations. RRIs are 100 - day initiatives, often 
done in series. They are results -focused and, hence, 
                                                        
vi World Development Indicators, World Bank, 2017.  
vii Annual data for Niger from the health information management 
system , HMIS.  reinforce the results orientation of the district heal th plan. 
The operational RRIs are impleme nted two to three times 
annually at the level of health centers with technical support 
from respective districts. Lessons -learned from each are 
then used to improve activities planned by the district. The 
teams impl ementing RRIs include personnel from heal th 
centers, posts and community health workers (CHWs) as 
well as community members. This reinforces links between 
demand and supply -side actors and strengthens health 
service -community collaboration. RRIs are based on the 
premise that collaboration helps c ommunities identify 
solutions and tackle difficult – generally non -technical – 
constraints to achieving DLIs. The project included work in 
53 districts and 836 health centers by 944 RRI teams.  
 
Methodology.  This kno wledge brief presents the three main 
areas of learning from districts in which the RRIs were used. 
Outcome harvesting  was used to capture and document 
these findings. Stakeholder interviews were conducted 
during a two -week field visit in May 2019  
using a sample of district visits in Dosso and Tahoua . RRI 
teams validated the results during a knowledge -sharing 
workshop in Niamey in April 2019.  
Result  Areas  
I. Improved Results -Based Learning in Districts  
53 districts implemented 100 -day (3 -4 month) RRIs to 
advance the DLIs. Through a cyclical process of results -
based planning, monitoring and learning, health centers, 
local government authorities and communities developed 
and tested ways to improve the effectiveness of district 
health activities.  
 
Results st ories   
Key achievements included:  
•   Systematic  involvement of community members and 
local government in health planning, often for the first  
time. RRI teams consisted of health personnel and 
community members (doctors, midwives, women 
viii RRI interventions to increase DLI2 (assisted birth), were successful in 
some communities, where traditional birth assistants  were active in RRI 
teams. More focus is required to improve this indicator.  Observed

Outcome harvesting is a  qualitative assessment tool to 
learn from complex development processes that involve 
multiple actors. In this approach, an outcome is defined 
as a change of behavior, relationship, or action  of the  
beneficiaries or groups with whom a program works 
directly. The tool can provide results stories to learn from 
implementation experiences.

 leaders, religious l eaders, etc.) for results -based 
learning to adv ance the DLIs and were facilitated by a 
local coach trained on RRI methodology.  
• RRI teams met on a weekly basis to manage the 
implementation of plans for the DLIs. This created a 
culture of participatory moni toring, problem 
identification, learning and co urse correction. The teams 
used a local dashboard and work plan to monitor their 
actions.  
• The districts financed RRI activities through their 
annual health plan and budgeted and integrated the 
RRI lessons to a djust planned activities. Some 
stakeholders als o provided financial and in -kind 
contributions to support the implementation of the 
DLI plans. This increased participation of the 
community and ownership around the results of the 
RRIs.  
• The autonomy of manag ing the cyclical RRI 
learning, increased the le adership of districts and 
health centers, as well as the voice and participation 
of communities in health planning.  
 
 
 
Project Contribution  
Key PHSP activities supported these outcomes:  
• The MOH signed annual  performance plan with the 
regions, which included targets for RMNCH+N 
indicators.  
• Regions conducted stakeholder analysis that identify 
stakeholders that had influence on the achievement of 
DLIs, and that helped communities create strategies to 
address the  DLIs.  
• The MOH trained 1,02 2 results coaches at the national, 
regional, district and community levels. The coaches 
provided mentorship and leadership coaching to RRI 
teams.  
• The MOH facilitated knowledge -exchange across 
districts to share lessons, facilitat e scale -up of 
innovations a nd provide technical support.  • The MOH developed operational guidelines and a 
decree that created a national committee to oversee 
the results -based learnin g. 
 
II. Social mobilization that resulted in increased demand 
for RMNCAH + N  
RRI teams mobilized local leaders and conducted Social and 
Behavioral Change Communication (SBCC) to generate 
demand for RMNCH + N services and develop innovative 
measures for addressing issues arising along the RRI 
process.  
 
Results stories  
Key achieve ments include d: 
• Districts organized door -to-door caravans to 
underserved areas. These caravans mobilized 
community leaders to communicate messages to 
families not utilizing health service. Additionally, with the 
help of RRI Coaches, participants in the car avans 
mapped their communities, identifying remote areas and 
pockets of households that did not seek out health 
services.  
• RRI teams organized awareness -raising talks on local 
radios, involving women, religious and traditional 
leaders.  
• Health centers offer ed free media tion services and 
counseling  to families and couples reluctant to services. 
This increased understanding and willingness to utilize 
FP, skilled deliveries, vaccination and nutritional 
counseling.  
• In some communities, traditional birth attendan ts (TBAs) 
accompanied pregnant women to health centers and 
conducted SBCC. The acceptance of TBAs to engage in 
such work was a game changer. They accepted 
because of their role in the RRI team and newfound 
awareness of the risks associated with home births .  
• CHWs track ed pregnant women and infants “lost to 
follow -up” and went door -to-door to visit these families. 
This increased the number of infants with an updated 
growth chart, and vaccinations.  
• Some religious leaders included FP and skilled birth 
attendan ce in their w eekly sermons. played a key role in 
defeating rumors and changing social norms around FP.  
• Some villages chiefs implemented sanctions on home 
deliveries, penalizing families that did not use assisted 
delivery services.  
 
Project Contribution  
Key PHSP activit ies supported these outcomes:  
• RRI teams developed 100 -day plans to advance the 
DLIs and held weekly meetings to monitor progress on 
these plans and make corrective actions when planned RESULT  STORY  FROM  RESULT  AREA  I: 
Contribution of community to achieving DLIs  
 
Long distances and lack of financial  means are key 
hurdles to pre -natal consultation and assisted delivery. In 
health centers that increased assisted delivery, villagers 
organized transportation (cars, carts, motorcycles) for 
pregnant women. The practice continued months after 
the end of an RRI cycle.  
 
Loca l communities also pooled funds to improve the 
conditions of the health center, including ensuring soap, 
beds, and a maternity area.

activities did not see the intended results.  
• RRI teams he ld community -wide evaluations of 
progress at the 50 and 100 day -mark, to review results 
toward the DLIs, identify effective practices and scale -
up successful strategies in the district health plan.  
 
 
 
III. Improved Delivery of Services by Health Centers  
Results stories  
Key achievements included:  
• Health centers offered mobile services to women and 
children in remote villages on a monthly basis. The 
involvement of community members and the increased 
frequency improved access.  
• Some health centers started off ering FP services at 
night to women and ad olescents. This provided much -
needed privacy to beneficiaries. Night visits to 
households helped increase adolescents’ use of FP.  
• The health centers in Dosso and Tillaberi organized 
discussion groups in “safe space s” with adolescents on 
the use of modern c ontraceptives.  
• Health centers undertook surveys and consultations in 
the community to understand the perception of services, 
and how to make improvements.  
• Health centers in Dosso and Tillaberi created a separate 
maternity wing a few steps away from the he alth center 
to address the privacy concerns of women.  
• Health centers in the district of Maradi publicized the 
prices of services. This standardized prices and was 
fundamental in overcoming corruption.  
• Regions tr ained health professions on ethical standar ds 
for delivering services. This helped strengthen the 
professionalism of health agents when communicating 
with clients.  
 
Project Contribution  
Key PHSP activities, including the provision of technical 
support a nd targeted training and coaching to implemen t activities in the RRI work plan, supported these outcomes.  
 
Conclusions  
RRIs mobilized districts to work with communities to improve 
their health plans and make significant progress on key 
indicators. In doing this, it has supported new innovations, 
and empowered decentralized leadership and learning.  The 
approach has, in effect, created a platform and entry point to 
support improved service delivery in communities.  The RRIs 
produced many significant in novations that have be en 
scaled -up partially across districts. The MOH is now working 
to figure out how to scale -up to the national level. Finally, 
there is a need for further MOH support to reinforce M&E at 
district/community level and the quality of serv ices in 
facilities.

 RESULT  STORY  FROM  RESULT  AREA  II: 
Systematic and collaborative mobile services  
 
Before RRI, some health ce nters conducted door -to-door 
and mobile outreach services to deliver services, but 
these activities only involved health personnel.  
 
These activities now happen weekly and involve 
community members in the activities. Community 
members now have a voice in the planning and 
implementation of the door -to-door activities.

 RESULT  STORY  FROM  RESULT  AREA  III: 
Shifting role of traditional birth attendants  
 
The lack of TBAs  is a challenge to increasing skilled birth 
attendance. To counter this, some health centers trained 
TBAs and used RRIs to jumpstart t heir work .  
 
TBAs  agreed to accompany pregnant women to health 
centers  and play ed a major role as mediators to promote 
the utilization of health services , information campaigns and 
advocacy efforts.
