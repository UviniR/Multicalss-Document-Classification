 OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS  
 
Digital ID:  Digital identity (Digital ID) refers to information on an entity used by computer 
systems to represent an external agent. That agent may be a person, organisation, application, 
or device. The information is a "set of attributes related to an entity" that enable the entity to 
be autonomously identified. For this study, the agents are people eligible for a national ID.  
 
Digital identification systems:  Infrastructure and process used to design, establish, use and 
maintain digital identities either for civil i dentification, or as an adjunct to broader service 
delivery. For this study, the National ID system will be considered  
 
Identity assurance:  The ability to determine, with some level of certainty that a claim to a 
particular identity made by a person or en tity can be trusted to actually be the claimant's “true” 
identity.  
 
National digital identity system:  A government -supplied national system that provides digital 
identities based on identity attributes defined by national law.  
 
Unique identification number : A number that uniquely identifies an individual and can be 
used to link an identity across databases and systems in both the public and private sector. 
National identity providers may issue a UIN to citizens and residents for their lifetime.  
 
National Id entification Number:  A special number given to an individual that uniquely 
identifies him/her from the rest of the population in a given country.

 SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS  
 
This study set out to undertake a double bottom line analysis to assess the economic and social 
value of Uganda’s national digital ID system. A population -based survey that was 
representative of the entire country was conducted among 2,892 adult Ugandans ( aged 18 and 
above). Costs and benefits data were  also collected from the relevant government agencies, 
with which a cost -benefit analysis of government’s investment into rolling out the national ID 
was conducted.  
 
At the individual user level, this study found clear evidence of socio -economic benefits to 
individual National ID holders associated with possession of National IDs. Such benefits range 
from digital finance and economic inclusion to civil identification, accessing bureaucratic 
services and government programs, and facilitating business or civil transactions. The National 
ID therefore is very important as a tool for socio -economic inclusion and a means to access 
and participate in the digital economy.  Note worthy, the lowest quintile of the population felt 
the least benefit from having a National ID. 
 
This assessment also found clear evidence that the value realized by the government from the 
National ID system as a tool for increasing accountability exceede d the investment in setting 
up the system. Moreover, the benefits were determined only from very few government 
programs that had integrated the National ID as an accountability tool, and much more can be 
realized if more government programs and third -party users integrate use of the National ID in 
their accountability systems. A summary of specific findings from the study is presented below:  
 
Ownership of a National ID : While 94.1% of Ugandans sought to register for national IDs 
the proportion of Ugandans who currently have a National ID is estimated at 78.9%, as shown 
in Fig. 1.

 Reasons for not having a National ID  
Figure 2: Frequently cited reasons for not having a national ID  
 
The most frequently 
cited reasons for not 
having a national ID 
were ; incomplete 
registration, did not 
register at all, lost 
the National ID, not 
collecting the 
National ID and 
slow  registration 
processes, as shown 
in Fig. 2.   
 
 
 
 
Ease of obtaining a National ID : Registration for the National IDs was generally accessible 
with the majority of participants registering at their nearest local administrative unit 
(village/zone) as indicated in Table 1. Ninety three percent of the participants were within five 
kilometres of a registration site.

 Cost of acquiring and maintaining a  National ID  
Figure 3a: Purpose of unofficial payments  
 
The cost to individuals of acquiring a 
National ID is very low, with 84% of 
participants not incurring any expenses. 
The average expenses for acquiring a 
National ID stood at Uganda Shillings 
1,775/= (US$ 0.5).  Costs related to 
National ID maintenance, correction and 
replacement were low, 89% of those who 
spent money on maintenance/safety of 
their IDs spent less than 5,000 Uganda 
shillings (US$ 1.4). The average cost 
incurred in maintaining a national ID was 
3,856 Uganda shillings (about US$ 1.1), 
with a range of 0 to 70,000 shillings (US$ 
0 to  19.4). Among individuals who 
sought replacement  or recovery of a 
National ID , 47.2% incurred costs ranging between 5,000 (US$ 1.4) and 50,000 (US$ 14) while 
11.3% incurr ed costs above 50,000 (US$ 14).  
 
Only 3.5% of participants reported that they made unofficial payments during registration. The 
majority of unofficial payments were for support services by ‘consultants’ to help National ID 
applicants  fill or interpret  the forms  and facilitate fast -trackin g of the registration process 
amidst long queues as indicated in Fig. 3a .  Unofficial payments at this stage were more 
frequent among participants in the lowest wealth quintile (4.9%) compared to the higher wealth 
quintiles (2.9%) (p=0.014).  
 
Figure 3b: Actions undertaken by holders to ensure safety and maintenance of their 
National ID  
 
Among the actions taken to ensure 
safety of the National ID, the most 
frequent were ; storage in a safe place 
at home, careful handling and, 
carrying a duplicate copy instead of 
the original, as indicated in Fig. 3 b.

Male participants and urban participants were more likely to perceive National IDs as very 
useful compared to female participants and rural participants, as discussed later in the report.  
 
Who is more likely to benefit from the National ID?   
● People in the highest wealth quintile, those who reside in urban areas, those who 
attended any level of formal education, female participants and those in older age -
groups were more likely to benefit from economic and financial inclusion as a result of 
having a Nati onal ID.  
● People from the highest wealth quintile, female participants and those in older age -
groups were more likely to benefit from using the National ID as a civil identification 
artefact.  
● People in the second wealth quintile, those from urban areas, tho se who attained higher 
levels of education, and those in the older age -groups were more likely to benefit from 
using their National ID to access bureaucratic services.  
● People of higher wealth status, higher educational attainment, older age categories, 
those involved in retail, and those involved in casual labour were more likely to benefit 
from using the National ID for business/civil transactions.  
 
Challenges associated with having a National ID : The most frequent concerns associated 
with possessing an I D were: safety of the National ID (69% of participants), and fear of 
wrongful use when stolen/misplaced (51.8%). Others were concerned that the private details 
taken by registering officers can be misused (11.2%)  while 9.2% believed that the National ID 
is a tool for surveillance. More than half (53.8%) of the participants reported to have 
experienced no challenge regarding maintenance of the National ID.  
 11 
 Cost of setting up the National ID system : The total cost of establishing and rolling out the 
National ID registration process was about US$ 56,197,126. The main cost driver was 
enrolment (52%) closely followed by pre -enrolment (46%), while card issuance costs were 
substantially lower (2%). Ninet y-seven percent of the costs were non -recurrent (or capital) 
costs. The cost of producing and issuing one National ID was US$ 4.0. The total adjusted value 
of the costs associated with establishing the National ID is US$ 37,951,536.  
 
Cost -benefit analysis  of setting up the National ID system to government   
● The total present value of benefits realised from National ID use in programs for which 
data is available is US$ 51,151,280.  
● The total savings from four public social assistance programs that were able to avail 
data on losses prevented was US$ 1,879,622 in the first year of National ID integration.  
● The total savings from the payroll and pension -funds payments as a result of being able 
to weed out ‘ghost’ payees was US$ 10,197,817 in the first year of in tegrating into the 
National ID system.  
● The total estimated administrative savings by use of National ID systems for voter 
verification was US$ 30,554,396.  
● It is worth noting that there are several programs where the data on how the use of the 
National ID has enabled savings from losses or administrative access is not available.  
● The cost -benefit ratio is 1.35 which is higher than 1 meaning that for every US$1 
invested in the National ID system therefore, the present return on investment is 
US$1.35. The proj ect has a positive Net Present Value of US$ 13,199,744. However, 
the limited range of programs contributing to this estimate indicates that much higher 
value could be derived.  12 
 KEY PROGRAMMATIC RECOMMENDATIONS  
Integration  
● Government should promote the National ID as the unifying identifier in all transactions 
requiring personal identification so as to reduce the use of multiple identification artefacts 
by third -party agencies like banks, credit institutions and service deli very agencies. This 
can be achieved through nurturing systems that support third party use.  
 
● For Uganda to attain full economic value from the National ID, government should 
expand b oth the scale and scope of the National ID use in accountability systems.  The 
benefits realized from the pay -roll and pension clean -up and those from social support 
and livelihoods programs ought to be extended to other sectors including tax revenue 
manag ement system, the integrated financial management s ystem, local government  
monitoring systems, the voters’ register and the immigration system.  Given that 21% of 
the population do not have a National ID and therefore would  be excluded from receiving 
certain services, government should ensure that inclusion safeguards such as policies to 
accommodate individuals who lack a National ID are put in place.  
 
Coverage  
● The Government of Uganda through the NIRA should undertake supplementary 
registration ‘catc h-up’ drives to increase National ID coverage to over 90%. These 
registration drives should especially target those who start but do not complete the 
process. NIRA should build on the successful strategies that facilitated a high turn up in 
the initial reg istration exercise to ensure sustained demand for registration. Further, 
routine National ID registration activities should be brought as close as possible to the 
population, to ensure accessibility for new National ID seekers.  
 
● Factors that disadvantage some demographic groups during National ID registration 
should be addressed by NIRA. For example, the gender disparities in the registration 
environments that lead to longer waiting times for women ought to be addressed. The 
urban  context where work pressures may affect willingness of people to wait for services 
should be mitigated by establishing more registration centres. In the rural areas where 
reaction may be slower, registration services need to be made continually available.   
 
● Mobilization by NIRA to increase the current National ID coverage should target the 
socio -demographic disparities that affect access to registration services. Specifically, 
special programs to target young people aged 16 -19 years and 20 -29 years should be put 
in place if the country is to sustain good rates of National ID coverage. Mechanisms for 
identification and registration of young people who have just attained the age of majority 
should be put in place including the strengthening of routine Nationa l ID registration 
activities in schools.  
 
● Government should draw on the successes of the mass National ID registration process to 
strengthen accessibility to routine registration services, bringing them as close to the 
population as possible. Periodic mop -up activities should be conducted in zones that have 
low coverage. A question on ownership of a National ID should be included in the 
national census and the periodic demographic and living standards surveys so that the 
government can continually track th e National ID coverage trends.  
 
● Government should sensitize the population on the benefits of possession of a National 
ID beyond it being a statutory requirement. By recognizing the benefits, non -National ID 13 
 holders , especially the young people and people in rural areas , will be better motivated to 
seek ownership of one.  
 
● To ensure that high coverage with National ID registration is sustained, the government 
should maintain its support to registration services so that they remain free for citizens. 
Registr ation sites should also provide support to people who cannot read or write, so as to 
further reduce the need for them to pay fees to interpreters at the registration points. 
Routine registration services should be expanded and made accessible at the lowest  
administrative levels and where possible integrated within the local government 
functions.  
 
● Government should strengthen the support system for ID card e rror correction and 
replacement. These services for replacement of lost National IDs and correction of errors 
should be made accessible at the lower local government levels to ease National ID 
replacement.  Decentralization will address the disparities faced especially by people 
living in urban settings and those with in the lowest wealth quinti le who may not afford 
the high costs associated with correcting errors  and card replacement  at the NIRA 
headquarters.  
 
Trust, Data protection and privacy  
● To encourage greater usage of National IDs and realize even greater benefits, 
Government should ensure that Ugandans can trust that their information will be safe and 
not misused. In addition to sensitizing the population, there need to be effective guardrails 
that protect data, and penalties/measures if data breach occurs  
 
● Government should put measures to fast -track full implementation of the Data Protection 
and Privacy Act, 2019.  
 
● To allay communities’ concerns about privacy of their data, NIRA should continually 
sensitize the population and reassure them that their data is safe.  
 
● Third party users should be closely monitored by NIRA to ensure that they protect the 
data they access from the  National ID database .  
 
● Government should strengthen the interoperability of the National ID with third party user 
systems by putting in place the necessary infrastructure to support access to the National 
ID database  while ensuring appropriate data protection and safeguards .  
 
● As greater use of the National ID occurs  through linking administrative and social service 
systems with the national ID database , appropriate policies should  be enacted  by 
government to ensure data protection and minimization of access by unauthorized actors.

 1.0 INTRODUCTION  
Globally, over one billion people lack a legally recognized identification artefact. Of these, 
81% live in South Asia and Sub Saharan Africa (World Bank, 2016, 2018). Forty seven 
percent of  these are reported younger than the age of majority, which has a l ink to poor birth 
registration systems (World Bank, 2018). Lack of recognized identification is associated with 
lower access  to basic services (World Bank, 2018) and weakened human and civil rights like 
voting (Desai V., M. Mitt, K. Chandra, 2017). In some  cases, people without official 
identification fail to access health, education and financial services as well as livelihoods 
development programs. On the other hand, a country without a good identification system is 
affected through sub -optimal tax collec tion, inadequate civic participation, insecurity, and 
inadequate planning for provision of social services (Biscaye P., Coney S., Eugenia Ho, 
Hutchinson B., Neidhardt M., Anderson L., Reynolds T. 2015;  P., J. Logg and R. Larrick , 
2016; Atick, J. 2016). T he objective of universal identification is stipulated in the 2030 
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 16, which tackles the need for inclusive societies and 
institutions at all levels. Target 16.9 of this goal highlights that legally acceptable 
identificat ion should be accessible to all, so that no population is excluded from services due 
to a lack of identification.  
 
Worldwide, countries are increasingly embracing national identity cards, including several 
countries in sub -Saharan Africa (Biscaye et. al. 2015), with digital IDs as the standard. A sound 
National ID system should fulfil ten principles ( World Bank and Centre for Global 
Development 2017 ), in three main categories (inclusion, design and governance) as 
summarized in Table 3.  
 
Table 3: Ten principles for a sound National ID system  
INCLUSION: 
Universal 
coverage and 
accessibility  1. Ensuring universal coverage for individuals from birth to death, free 
from discrimination  
2. Removing barriers to access and usage and disparities in the 
availability of information and technology  
DESIGN: 
Robust, secure, 
responsive, and 
sustainable  3. Establishing a robust —unique, secure, and accurate —identity  
4. Creating a platform that is interoperable and responsive to the needs 
of various users  
5. Using open standards and ensuring vendor and technology 
neutrality.  
6. Protecting user privacy and control through system design  
7. Planning for financial and operational sustainability without 
compromising accessibility.  
GOVERNANC
E: Building trust 
by protecting 
privacy and user 
rights  8. Safeguarding data privacy, security, and user rights through a 
comprehensive legal and regulatory framework  
9. Establishing clear institutional mandates and accountability  
10. Enforcing legal and trust frameworks though independent oversight 
and adjudication of grievances  
 
USAID’s Center for Digital Development (CDD)’s Strategy and Research team has also  
conducted a study on the role of digital identification systems in development ( USAID 2017 ). 
That work considered digital ID systems both in their present -day form as well as envisioning 
how IDs will evolve in the near future. Across sectors and across countries, the CDD found 15 
 several common narratives depicting an often -fragmented ID landscape, with siloed systems 
and short -term or sector -bound design motivations. There was also a lack of rigorous  evidence 
on how identification systems provide social and economic value, both to the institutions that 
invest in them (especially governments), and to users ( USAID 2017 ).  
 
Uganda, like other countries in East Africa, adopted a National  digital ID system in 2014. By 
law, all citizens aged 16 and above are required to register for a National ID that is linked to 
their demographic and biometric data. The National Identification  and Registration Authority 
(NIRA) was established. NIRA undertook a mass registration activity that saw the 
establishment of National ID registration centres at the lowest local administration levels. 
Additional ‘mop -up’ registration drives were undertake n, especially after the Uganda 
Communications Commission introduced a requirement for all telephone SIM Card holders to 
link the registration of their SIM Card to their National ID. This measure also drove telecom 
companies to become major third -party user s of the National ID database.  
 
Valid identification is intended to promote a population’s ability to access and claim services 
and sovereign rights. The benefits can further be linked to social, political, and economic 
development as governments are bett er able to plan for their citizens. The introduction of digital 
identification is also reported to make ID systems much more robust, valid, and inter -operable. 
In countries like Uganda, over 75% of the population has registered for National IDs. However, 
despite the increasing roll out of digital ID systems in developing countries, there is a paucity 
of data on the utility of these systems to the ID holders, and the value they bring to the investors 
in the systems, primary users, and third -party  users of th ese systems. It is not clear whether the 
intended economic benefits to government have been realized. In addition, unintended benefits 
and harm from these systems have not been documented.  
 
The general objective of this study is to quantify the social and economic value realized by 
both users and investors in establishing and using Uganda’s national digital identity system. 
The specific objectives are:  (1) To determine the socio -economic benefits, experienced by 
investors, primary users and thir d-party users of national digital identity cards in Uganda, (2) 
To determine the socio -economic harm and challenges experienced by investors, primary users 
and third -party users of national digital identity cards in Uganda, (3) To assess the correlates 
of benefitting from the national digital identity system among ID users in Uganda, and (4) To 
assess the economic benefit of national identity cards to the investors and users in Uganda. The 
study follows up on the findings of a qualitative study conducted in  the same context to identify 
the benefits and challenges attached to the National ID.

 2.0 APPROACH  
This report presents two components: the Survey and a Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA). In the 
first component, the benefits of having and using a digi tal ID were quantified from the 
perspective of the ID holders. This was conducted through a household survey in Uganda 
targeting a nationally representative sample of 2,892 participants aged 18 years and above 
selected from the 15 statistical regions of Ug anda (as used in the national Health and 
Demographic Surveys).  
 
 
Figure 4: Map of Uganda indicating the study sites  
 
 
A two -stage sampling design was used. The first stage involved selection of 182 enumeration 
areas (EA) allocated proportionate to the population sizes of the statistical regions. Thereafter, 
the enumeration areas in each statistical region were divided up between rural and urban EAs 
using the urbanization index for each region (details of the allocations are provided in the 
appendices). The 14 households from each enumeration area were selected using systematic 
sampling, and where multiple eligible particip ants (i.e. people aged 18 years and above) were 
present in a household, one was selected using simple random sampling.  
 
Data was analyzed for the following: The study variables were: (1) Background socio -
demographic characteristics of participants; (2) Pr evalence of National ID ownership and 
associated factors, (3) Processes and experiences during acquisition of the national ID and 
associated costs, (3) Socio -economic benefits and value, experienced by investors, primary 
users and third -party users of nati onal digital identity cards in Uganda, (4)  Socio -economic 
harm and challenges experienced by investors, primary users and third -party users of national 
digital identity cards in Uganda (5) Factors associated with benefitting from the national digital 
identity system among ID users in Uganda.

In the second component, a cost -benefit analysis of the value that investors derive from 
establishing the national digital ID system was conducted. Data for estimation of both the costs 
and monetized benefits was collected through structured checklists administered to the 
investors in the national ID system. The checklists collected information on the resource inputs 
and their costs, the benefits realized and the unit costs, enabling a valuation of both the benefit s 
and costs. Data was captured in an electronic spreadsheet with automated formulas to enable 
computation of total discounted costs and benefits and subsequently the cost benefit ratio, to 
indicate the return on investing in the national digital ID system.

More females participated in the study (58.5%) compared to males (41.5%). One third of 
participants were from rural areas. The mean age of participants was 38.2 years, with a median 
stated age of 35 years, and a range of 18 -110 years. Nine percent of parti cipants had not had 
formal education while 45.5% had not reached the secondary level of education. The vast 
majority of participants were subsistence farmers (40.3%). The median household income per 
month was 60,000 Uganda Shillings (approximately US$ 16.4 ).  
 
The higher participation of women compared to men in this study is attributed to the socio -
cultural setting in which more women stay at home compared to men. The predominantly rural 
distribution of participants is similar to Uganda’s profile in which most people reside in the 
rural areas. The age structure aligns with Uganda’s population structure, given that Uganda’s 
population is mainly composed of younger people. The marital status, occupational status, and 
level of education of participants were represe ntative of the current profile for Uganda among 
people aged 16 and above. The median household income shows that the majority of 
participants are low income earners.  
 
3.2 Possession of a national ID  
The findings show that 94.1% of Ugandans sought to regis ter for national IDs. However, the 
proportion of Ugandans who currently have an ID is estimated at 78.9%. Of those who sought 
to register for national IDs, about 9% did not complete the registration process. Among those 
who completed registration, about 2%  did not receive or pick their national IDs, while 4% of 
the people who obtained their national IDs no longer have them. It is important to note that 
there is no significant difference between male and Female  with respect to National ID 
registration and po ssession.   Table 5 summarizes the current status of ownership of a national 
ID in Uganda.

Anecdotal reports from the National Identification and Registration Authority (NIRA) show 
that over 90% of Ugandans registered for national IDs. However, although the initial turn -up 
was high, the current ownership of IDs stands at about 79%, meaning that about one fifth of 
Ugandans do not currently have IDs. It implies that although a high number of people were 
interested in obtaining the IDs, several did not complete the process or lost the IDs after 
obtaining them. This rate of ID possession is consisten t with anecdotal reports by the World 
Bank and the Uganda Communications Commission that estimate current possession of 
National IDs to be about four -fifths of Ugandans. Non -completion of registration and 
replacement of lost IDs therefore should be priorit y considerations for which solutions ought 
to be sought by the managers of the National ID system. Possession of a National ID is crucial 
as some services such as healthcare and eligibility to vote or be voted for, are now linked to 
the national ID. Linkin g services to the national ID database  is likely to exclude about 21% of 
the population who do not currently possess a National ID.  
 
3.2.1  Who is more likely to possess a national ID?  
An assessment of the socio -demographic correlates of current possession of a national ID was 
conducted. The purpose was to identify whether some population sub -groups were less likely 
to have a national ID compared to others, so as to inform the program on  groups that need 
additional mobilisation and support. To do this, regression models were used. People from the 
Eastern, Northern, South Western, Western and Kampala regions were more likely to possess 
National IDs compared to those from the reference regi on, South Central. Urban dwellers were 
more likely to possess National IDs  compared to rural residents. Compared to the youngest 
age-group in the study (18 -19 years), all older age -groups were more likely to possess a national 
ID. The likelihood of possess ing a national ID showed an increasing trend with increasing age 
categories between the ages 20 -29 years and 60 -69 years. This trend is further illustrated in 
Fig. 5 
 
 
 21 
 Figure 5: Distribution of ID ownership by age -group  
 
 
Participants who are married/ever been married were more likely to possess National IDs 
compared to single people. Participants with a higher education level (i.e. upper secondary or 
higher) were more likely to possess National IDs compared to those with n o formal education. 
Likewise, participants in the higher wealth quintiles were more likely to possess National IDs 
compared to those in the lowest wealth quintile. The likelihood of having a national ID 
increased consistently with increasing age categories , levelling off in the age -group 60 -64. The 
youngest age -categories (18 -19 and 20 -29) had the least National ID ownership rates  standing 
at 5.2% (150) and 28.7% respectively (829) . It is important to note that in 2017, NIRA held a 
mass registration campaig n for students in primary and secondary schools. The aim of the 
campaign was to provide students with a NIN which would make them eligible to claim their 
National ID once they reach the age of 16. By the end of 2017, NIRA had reportedly registered 
9.8 mill ion students (GSMA report Uganda, 2018).  However , this National ID study did not 
include participants below 18 years  hence potentially excluding a significant number of 
students who were registered by NIRA  
 
The association between ID possession and socio -economic status is likely due to easier access 
to ID registration sites and to replacement services when National IDs are lost. Since the mass 
National ID registration exercise targeted people from the age of 16 years, it is expected that 
all people aged 18 -19 at the time of this survey were eligible during the mass registration 
exercise. The low ID ownership in the younger age categories is attributed to low ID 
registration rates in this age -group compared to the older age -groups which might be due to 
eithe r lack of interest by people in this age category, or the fact that a substantial percentage of 
people in this age -group are dependent on other family members, or do not have mobile phones. 
The higher percentage of National ID ownership among people who ha ve ever been married is 
likely linked to age but could also be due to a higher utility for National IDs among people who 
have family responsibilities compared to single people. Marriage comes with family  and social 
responsibilities  such as  enrolling childr en into schools which requires a copy of a parent’s 
National ID. 
 
22 
 3.2.2 Reasons for not having an ID  
The reasons for not having a National ID were explored among participants that did not have 
one at the time of the assessment. Further stratified analyses were conducted to assess if the 
reasons cited for non -possession of a National ID differed by gender,  residence, and socio -
economic status. Table 6 summarizes the main findings:

The five most frequently cited reasons for not having a national ID were: (1) incomplete 
registration (33.7%), (2) did not register at all (21.2%), (3) lost the National ID (19.9%), (4) 
did not collect the National ID (9.4%), and (5) slow registration proc esses (7.7%).  Female 
participants were more likely to cite long lines at registration and affordability of the 
registration process as barriers compared to male participants. On the other hand, male 
participants were more likely to cite loss of IDs and no n-citizenship as barriers. A higher 
percentage of participants from urban areas cited loss of the ID and slow registration processes 
as reasons for non -possession of a National ID compared to rural participants. On the other 
hand, more rural participants c ited insufficient time for the registration process compared to 23 
 urban participants. Participants from the higher wealth quintiles were more likely to cite non -
completion of the registration process compared to those in the lowest quintile. On the other 
hand, those in the lowest wealth quintile were more likely to cite not registering at all or lack 
of awareness about the National ID process compared to those in the higher wealth quintiles.  
 
The most frequently cited reasons for not having an ID were related  to the registration process; 
either non -completion of registration or not registering. These reasons were more prevalent 
among people in the lowest wealth quintile, probably due to challenges in filling registration 
forms as they were in English as well a s the unofficial fees . Rural dwellers were more likely to 
cite insufficient time for registration compared to urban residents. This could be attributed to 
high concentration and more access to different communication channels (especially, 
television, radio , billboards , newspapers, social media) in the urban areas compared to the rural 
areas.  
 
3.2.3 Ease of obtaining a National ID  
Access to registration services and other experiences:  Experiences of the process of 
registering for a  National  ID are important as they determine the way people perceive the ease 
of obtaining the ID and in turn its uptake. The experiences of participants who registered and 
obtained a National ID were explored  using information on place of registration and place of  
collection . The majority of the study participants registered and collected their National IDs at 
the village/zone level  which is usually their area of residence. Very few people registered or 
collected their National IDs at higher administrative levels ( county, district/municipality and 
NIRA headquarters). The Fig . 6 and Table 7 show the main findings:

Findings affirm that registration for the National IDs was generally accessible and convenient. 
The majority of participants (71.4%) registered for their IDs at their nearest local administrative 
level (the village). Ninety -three percent of participants we re within five kilometers of a 
National ID registration service delivery point and 58% were within less than a kilometre of 
the service delivery point while 87.9% were within less than an hour’s walking distance to a 
registration service point. Biometric m easurements were taken for 99.5% of participants. For 
13 participants whose fingerprints  were not taken, the most frequently cited reason was 
abnormalities with fingers (46.2%) followed by unspecific reasons (30.8%).  
 
Ninety -five percent of participants wh o registered for National IDs went to only one place for 
their registration while about two thirds (67.2%) visited the registration site once. The mean 
number of site visits before registration was 1.6, with a median of 1 time and a range of 1 to 
15 times.  People in the higher wealth quintiles were more likely to undertake multiple visits 
before registration (34.5%) compared to those from the lowest wealth quintile (28.8%) 
(p=0.022).  
 
Waiting time at the registration sites was moderate. Slightly over half (53.1%) of participants 
waited for less than two hours before being registered. However, 30% of participants waited 
for 3 -6 hours while 16.7% waited for longer than 6 hours. The mean waiting time at the 
registration sites was 3.5 hours with a median of 2 h ours and a range of less than 1 hour to 48 
hours.  
Waiting times were significantly higher for female participants compared to males. The 
percentage of female participants who waited for longer than 6 hours at the registration service 
delivery point was 19 .5% compared to 13.0% for male participants. This could be attributed to  
women being more likely to be patient and wait for a service compared to men.  Some studies 25 
 have documented that f emale client s were more tolerant of delays  than their male counterparts  
(Nottingham, Johnson et al. 2018) . 
Although waiting time seemed to be equally distributed in the diff erent wealth categories, 
people in the higher wealth quintiles were more likely to experience the extreme waiting time 
of greater than 12 hours (2%) compared to those in the lowest wealth quintile (0.4%). This 
could be attributed to the fact that the wealt hy in this context generally tend to over report 
waiting time compared to those in the poorer wealth quintiles. This could be due to the many 
competing demands that sometimes make the wealthier uncomfortable to wait.     
There was no relationship between place of residence and long waiting time during registration.  
 
The majority of participants (57.4%) received their National IDs within 3 months after 
registration while 34.6% waited for 4 -6 months. Eight percent of partic ipants had to wait for 
longer than 6 months. People in the higher wealth quintiles took longer to obtain their IDs 
compared to those in the lowest wealth quintile (p=0.028). The mean time to collection of 
National IDs was 3.5 months, with a median of 3 mon ths and a range of less than 1 month to 
11 months.  
 
Fifty -five-point -five percent of participants said they required additional support during 
registration. Female participants were more likely to need additional support compared to male 
participants (p<0. 001). The required support was mainly in filling out the personal data forms. 
Regarding general perception about ease of registration, the majority of participants (58.6%) 
feel that the registration process was easy or very easy while 19.8% feel it was bea rable. 
However, about one fifth of participants (21.6%) feel the process was difficult or very difficult. 
Gender, rural/urban residence status and socio -economic status were not associated with 
perceived ease of the registration process.  
 
The findings that  most participants registered at the nearest local administrative level and that 
most participants were within 5 kilometers or one hour of the registration sites indicates that 
during the mass ID registration process, the infrastructure that was set up by the National 
Identification and Registration Authority enabled close physical access to the registration 
services, bringing them as close to the population as possible. Further to this, the findings that 
95% of participants who registered for National IDs went to only one registration site and that 
two thirds of participants visited their registration site once show that the sites also had high 
functional access. However, multiple visits to the registration sites needs to be reduced further 
by maximizing th e sites’ capacity for same -day services. In general, three quarters of 
participants perceived the ID registration process as easy, but this perception mostly applied to 
the mass registration exercise. The programmatic challenge for the National ID authorit y is to 
scale the mechanisms that were used to make mass registration services accessible so that they 
are equally as accessible for the routine registration activities.  
 
Other considerations to further strengthen accessibility of registration services are related to 
addressing the gender and socio -economic factors that might be differentially affecting access 
to the services by some sub -groups. The finding that women were more likely to experience 
longer waiting times at the waiting sites compared to men imply a need for more gender 
considerate registration environments. Likewise, the finding that people in the higher socio -
economic status category and those in urban areas were more likely to experience longer delays 
or undertake multiple visits calls for consideration of the urban population density, so that more 
registration centres are established in the urban areas. On the other hand, that people in the 
rural areas were more likely to cite insufficiency of the registration period implies that rural 
areas need longer registration timeframes than urban areas. The finding that the majority of 26 
 participants required additional support with the technicalities of the registratio n process 
(especially the interpretation and filling of registration forms) underscores the importance of 
such services at National ID registration sites.  
 
3.2.4 Expenses incurred during National ID registration  
Findings show that the cost of acquiring a National ID is very low. 84% of participants said 
they did not incur any expenses in acquiring a national ID while 95% of participants did not 
incur more than 5,000/= (US$ 1.4), including transport to the registra tion sites. The mean cost 
of acquiring a National ID was 1,775/= (US$ 0.5) with a median of 0/= (US$ 0).  
 
The National ID is supposed to be provided for free and there are no official charges during 
registration and pick up. Only 3.5% of participants repor ted that they made unofficial payments 
during registration. Unofficial payments at this stage were more frequent among participants 
in the lowest wealth quintile (4.9%) compared to the higher wealth quintiles (2.9%) (p=0.014). 
There were no gender or rural -urban differences in likelihood of payment for National ID 
services. Among 85 individuals who made unofficial payments during registration, the 
majority (70.6%) were requested to pay for special support services by ‘consultants’ who were 
not part of the r egistering teams, mainly to help them interpret, fill, or correct the entries in 
their forms. Therefore , the unofficial payments were mainly support services for participants 
who were unable to independently read or fill the forms. However, about one third  of those 
who made unofficial payments (32.9%) did so to skip the long queues.  
 
A very small proportion of participants (1.5%) reported to have made unofficial payments at 
the time of collection of their IDs, and similar to registration, most of these pay ments were for 
assistance to fill paperwork. Lower wealth quintile participants were more likely to incur costs 
at the time of collecting their IDs (2.3%) compared to the higher quintiles (1.2%) (p=0.037). 
Over one half (52.9%) of those who made unofficial  payments paid less than 5,000/= (US$ 
1.4) while 78.8% paid less than 20,000/= (US$ 5.6). The mean amount of unofficial payments 
among people who paid them was 15,000/= (US$ 4.2) with a median of 5,000/= (US$ 1.4), and 
a range of 200/= (US$ 0.06) to 100,00 0/= (US$ 27.8).  
 
This study shows that the cost of acquiring a National ID for a large majority of people was 
very low and the vast majority did not incur any costs. This factor combined with high 
accessibility of the registration sites and the mass mobil ization of the target population appear 
to be the main drivers of the high turn -up for the initial registration exercise. The implication 
is that programs for issuance of National IDs in resource constrained countries like Uganda are 
more likely to succeed  if funded by the government, so that the service is provided free of 
charge. This study also found that the occurrence of unofficial payments was very low and 
most of the payments were for complementary services that are required for some of the 
individua ls seeking ID registration (e.g. helping applicants who cannot read and write to fill 
out or correct their forms), especially for people in the lowest wealth quintile.  
 
3.2.5 Maintenance, correction of errors, loss and replacement of National IDs  
An assessment of practices related to maintenance of National IDs by their holders, including 
maintenance measures (actions taken to prevent them from damage) and correction of errors, 
loss of National IDs, and actions taken to replace them when lost was cond ucted. Detailed 
findings are presented in Table 8 and Fig. 7.

3.3 Measures for maintenance of the National ID  
Maintenance of the National ID was for this study defined as ‘undertaking actions to protect 
the ID from loss or damage’. Among the actions taken to maintain National IDs, the most 
frequent ones were (1) Storage in a safe place at home (78.4%), (2) careful  handling (42.8%), 
(3) carrying a duplicate copy instead of the original (37.8%), and (4) laminating the ID (13.4%). 
Some of these actions required participants to spend some money (48.2%) while others did not. 
Males, urban dwellers and people in the lower  wealth quintile were more likely to spend money 
to maintain their National IDs (p<0.001 for all categories) than their comparison groups.

 3.3.1 Loss and errors in National IDs  
One hundred and eighty -six of the participants who obtained a National ID (7. 7%) reported 
that they have ever lost their National ID. Female participants were more likely to have lost a 
National ID (9.1%) compared to males (6.7%). Loss of IDs was higher among urban residents 
(9.7%) compared to rural residents (6.7%) and those in th e lowest wealth quintile (9.3%) 
compared to those in the higher wealth quintiles (7.0%). Among the 186 people who lost their 
national ID, only 53 (28.5%) sought to recover or replace it. These included 37 (19.9%) who 
sought recovery and 16 (8.6%) who sough t replacement. Of 16 people who sought to replace 
their lost ID, 12 (75.0%) of them succeeded. Among 37 people who sought to recover their lost 
National ID, only 17 (45.4%) were able to find it. Fifty -eight -point -three percent of those who 
sought a Nationa l ID replacement were able to get it within 3 months, the rest taking longer. 
One half of the 12 people who sought to replace their National IDs describe the process as 
difficult.  
 
Seven percent of participants said they had errors in their National IDs. Errors were more 
frequent among urban (9.3%) compared to rural ID holders (5.8%) and among those in the 
lowest wealth quintile (10.0%) compared to higher wealth quintiles (5.7%). The  most frequent 
errors were (1) misspelled names, (2) wrong/missing date -of-birth, (3) unclear 
embossments/impressions, (4) unavailable/unclear finger -prints, and wrong/missing place of 
residence.  
 
Among 169 participants who had errors in their IDs, only 48 (28.5%) sought to correct the 
errors of whom 18.9% went directly to the National Identification and Registration Authority 
offices while 24.5% went to the police. Among the few participants with errors in their IDs 
who sought to correct them (n=48) , only one third succeeded in fixing the errors. Among those 
who succeeded in fixing their National ID errors, 18.8% of them took more than 6 months to 
get the errors corrected. The average duration of the correction process for National ID errors 
was 6 mo nths. In general, 77.1% of participants who sought to correct errors in their National 
IDs described the process as difficult.  
 
The finding that many participants undertook some measures to ensure that their National ID 
is protected and safe shows the impo rtance that people attach to their IDs. However, a National 
ID loss of 8% suggests a need for client sensitization on the importance of keeping their IDs 
safe, especially given the substantial investment by the government into the program. At 7%, 
the occur rence of errors in National IDs was significant given the complexity that comes along 
with correcting the errors. However, the findings that the majority of people with National ID 
errors did not seek to correct them, that the majority who sought to correc t them contacted the 
wrong offices and most of them did not succeed signify that the system for National ID error 
correction and replacement has structural and functional gaps that need to be addressed to 
increase accessibility to such support services.  
 
3.3.2 Expenses related to maintenance, correction and replacement of National IDs  
The costs that participants incurred in maintenance of their IDs, correction of errors on National 
IDs and replacement of lost IDs were assessed. Table 9  summarizes the main f indings.

About 90% of those who incurred costs in maintenance/safety of their IDs spent less than 
5,000 Uganda shillings (1.4 US$). The mean cost of the maintenance transactions for the 
National ID was only 3,856 Uganda shillings (about US$ 1.1) (median: 3,000 shil lings (0.8 
US$) (range: 0 to 70,000 Shillings or US$ 0 to 19.4). The mean cost of transport related to 31 
 correcting National ID errors was only 6,000 shillings (US$ 1.67) (range: 0 to 400,000 
shillings or US$ 0 to 111.1). The mean expenditure on other costs related to correcting errors 
in the National ID was 5,000 shillings (US$ 1.4) (range: 0 to 525,000 shillings (US$ 0 to 
145.8). The costs of replacement of lost National IDs were nearly equal to the costs of 
correcting National ID errors.  The National Ident ification Registration Authority charges a 
standard fee of 50,000 shillings (US $ 14) for correction of errors, recovery, or replacement 
of a National ID. During this process, persons incur other costs including transport and out -
of-pocket expenses. Some l ost National IDs are recovered at a relatively low cost from 
nearby locations such as police posts, office of local council chairpersons, or local radios. 
Noteworthy, both correction of errors and lost card replacement are done at NIRA 
headquarters located  in Kampala, the capital city of Uganda , hence increasing the final cost 
due to travel, lodging, feeding and other expenses .  
3.4 Benefits of having a national ID  
3.4.1 What benefits have National ID holders experienced?  
Participants were asked to identify the benefits they attribute to possession of national IDs or 
situations in which their National IDs have been useful. Table 10  summarises the key findings.

 The top benefits cited by individuals holding national IDs were: To facilitate registration of 
SIM-cards, proof of identity, voting, registration for mobile money, identification during in -
country travel, enrolment of children in school, accessing governme nt programs, opening a 
bank or microfinance account, accessing credit, security related identification, and accessing 
office premises. Ninety -seven -point -eight percent of National ID holders said they would 
encourage non -ID holders to obtain one because of  its usefulness to them. Up to 94.8% of 
people who have ever had a National ID think IDs are useful or very useful, as presented in

3.4.2 Categories of benefits of having a National ID  
Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was used to identify the underlying categories of 
benefits from the range of benefits cited by participants. The patterns of factors loading 
predominantly on each component were used to determine labels for the key emerg ing 
components. This analysis was initially conducted for all participants and thereafter stratified 
by gender, rural -urban residence and socio -economic status. Table 12 shows the initial 
emergent benefit categories from the analysis before stratification:

Stratifying by gender as indicated in table 6 of the appendices brings out two additional benefit 
categories: ‘Self -identification in civil transactions’ among male participants, rural dwellers 
and among those in the lowest wealth quintile and ‘Self -identi fication in important situations’ 
among females. Males seemed to use the ID for a broad range of civil transactions compared 
to women, hence the broad label of ‘civil transactions’. On the other hand,  women used the ID 
for fewer transactions which nonethel ess all seemed to be more important or urgent than other 
civil transactions hence the more specific label of ‘important situations’.  
 
When stratifying by rural -urban residence and socio -economic status (Table 7&8 in the 
appendices), the additional benefit categories ‘Proof of identity when accessing services’ and 
‘Security -related identification’ emerge among urban dwellers and those in the lowest wealth 
quintile. The emergent benefit category ‘Proof of identity when accessing services’ includes 
additional services beyond those observed under the initial component ‘financial and economic 
inclusion’, including voting, enrolling children in  school and accessing government programs. 34 
 The emergent benefit category ‘security related identification’ differs from its parent category 
‘Civil identification’ by including only security related sub -components. Among people of 
lowest wealth quintile, th e additional benefit category ‘When seeking employment’ emerges, 
which differs from its parent category ‘Accessing bureaucratic services’ by excluding 
subcomponents not related to employment seeking.  
 
These findings are likely attributable to more rigorous eligibility screening or security related 
scrutiny when assessing services in the public or private sector for urban dwellers and for 
people in the lowest wealth category but they could also mean that among people in these 
demographic groups, the National ID is the most reliable artefact to prove their identity.  
 
Central to the benefits of National IDs is their importance as a tool for financial and economic 
inclusion. In 2016, the Uganda Communications Commission required that all telephone SIM 
cards are linked to the National ID. Local mobile telecommunications providers aligned their 
systems to enforce this requirement. Unregistered SIM cards were deactivated, driving a 
second wave of mass registrations for National IDs. In a country where only 2 5% of the 
population have a bank account, mobile money services are essential for inclusion of a large 
percentage of the population into financial services. National IDs also facilitate people to open 
bank accounts and to access credit. These findings supp ort the importance of the National ID 
as a launchpad for the digital economy in Uganda, especially by contributing to security and 
trust of mobile phone transactions.  
 
The second major benefit category of National IDs arises from civil identification. This  is in a 
broad range of situations from security related identification in circumstances of travel, change 
of residence, screening for suspicious people or people in conflict with the law, voting, and in 
proving eligibility for government livelihoods suppo rt programs. A formative qualitative 
assessment of perceptions about IDs conducted in the same context showed that National IDs 
are a more reliable artefact for proving identity than other identification artefacts.  
 
The third and fourth major benefit area s of National IDs are their utility in facilitating access 
to bureaucratic services (e.g. employment related identification and accessing important 
offices) and their importance in facilitating the execution of contracts by affirming consent of 
the parties . Again,  these findings show the importance of National IDs in facilitating economic 
inclusion.  
 
3.4.3 Who is more likely to benefit from the main benefit categories of National IDs?  
PCA was used to develop factor scores for each of the four main emerging benefit categories 
namely: (1) Economic and Financial inclusion; (2) Proof of identity in situations where it is 
crucial; (3) Accessing bureaucratic services, and (4) Participating in business or civil 
transactions. Thereafter, the factor scores for each b enefit category were categorized into 
dichotomous variables that were used to run a regression analysis to assess who was more 
likely to benefit from the different benefit categories (See Appendices for the full results).  
 
People in the highest wealth quin tile (PR=1.5; p=0.003), those residing in urban areas (PR=1.4; 
p=0.004), those who attended any level of formal education, female participants (PR=1.2; 
p=0.009), people in older age -groups, people who are married or have ever been married, and 
casual labou rers (PR=2.2; p=0.002) were more likely to benefit from the category ‘Economic 
and financial inclusion’ as a result of possessing a national ID compared to those in the 
respective comparison categories. On the other hand, people North Central region  were 4 0% 35 
 less likely to benefit from financial inclusion compared to those from to the comparison region 
(South Central).  
 
Regarding use of the National ID for civil identification, people from the highest wealth 
quintile (PR=1.5; p=0.003) and people in older ag e-groups were more likely to benefit from 
using the ID as a civil identification artefact than people in the lowest wealth quintile and those 
in the youngest age category. Conversely, female participants were less likely to report this 
category of benefits  compared to male participants (PR=0.6; p<0.001).  
 
Regarding use of the National ID to access bureaucratic services, people in the second wealth 
quintile (PR=1.3; p=0.024), urban residents (PR=1.3p=0.019), people who attended higher 
levels of education, and people in the older age -groups, were more likely to benefit from using 
their National ID for this purpose compared to the alternative categories. On the other hand, 
female participants (PR=0.6; p<0.001), participants involved in retail (PR=0 .7; p=0.014), and 
those involved in casual labour (PR=0.5; p=0.005) were less likely to report this category of 
benefits.  
 
Benefits from using the National ID for business/civil transactions were more likely in people 
of higher wealth status, people of hig her educational attainment, people in the older age 
categories, people involved in retail (PR=2.4; p=0.003), and those involved in casual labour 
(PR=3.3; p<0.001) compared to the respective comparison categories.  
 
The finding that people from the highest w ealth quintile and urban residents were more likely 
to benefit from financial and economic participation by having a national ID is likely related 
to the fact that mobile money, credit/microcredit and mobile phones coverage are denser in the 
urban areas co mpared to the rural areas. On the other hand, the observation that people in older 
age-groups were more likely to use their National IDs for financial and economic benefit 
compared to the lowest age category is likely because most people in the lower age c ategory 
are not yet engaged in economic activities.  
 
The finding that people from the highest wealth quintile were more likely to use the ID for civil 
identification and to access bureaucratic services compared to those in the lowest wealth 
quintile is lik ely explained by the fact that people in the higher wealth bracket tend to be 
involved in a more civil transactions compared to those in the lower wealth bracket. A similar 
explanation holds for people in the older age -groups compared to those in the young er age -
groups. The finding that female participants and participants mainly occupied in retail or casual 
labour were less likely to report the benefit categories ‘use of the ID for civil identification’ 
and ‘use of the ID to access bureaucratic services’ m ight be related to gender and socio -
economic barriers in access to opportunities for civil transactions. These barriers are known to 
mainly affect women and people in informal employment.  
 
The finding that benefits from using the National ID for business/c ivil contracts were more 
likely in people of higher wealth levels, higher educational attainment, higher age categories, 
and those employed in retail or casual labour may be because these groups are more likely to 
be involved in business related transactio ns compared to their comparison groups.  
 
3.5 Challenges associated with having a National ID  
Possessing a National ID is not without challenges or fears. This assessment included an 
evaluation of the challenges associated with having a national ID. Participants indicated some 36 
 fears and concerns regarding possession of an ID and maintenance of the ID. An analysis of 
the most frequently cited challenges is presented in Table 13.

The most frequent concerns associated with possessing an ID were: Safety of the ID (69% of 
participants) and fear of wrongful use when stolen or misplaced (51.8%). Other respondents 
were concerned about possible confiscation of their National ID, misuse of  their private details 
by NIRA officials, and use of the National ID as a surveillance tool. Regarding maintenance 
of the ID, the main issue of concern to participants was replacement of the National ID when 
lost (10.6%). Other issues included being called  upon to be witnesses to agreements, lack of 
sensitization about National IDs, and openness of the National ID to misuse by other people.  
 
Male participants compared to female participants, were more likely to express fear about 
misuse of their National I Ds in fraudulent transactions (47.7%/39.9%;), fear about forcible 
confiscation of their IDs (11.9%/9.3%), fear that their private information might be misused 
(11.0/8.5%; ), or being under constant surveillance (9.2%/6.4%), and concern about being 
witnesse s to agreements (8.1%/5.9%; ).  
 
Urban residents were more likely than rural residents to express fear about loss of their National 
ID (60.8%/54.9%), fear about others using their IDs to register their SIM cards 
(16.9%/13.5%;), fear that their private info rmation might be misused (11.7%/8.5%), concern 
about replacement costs in the event of loss (13.2%/9.4%), concern about being witnesses to 
agreements (8.9%/5.7%; p=0.001),  fear that other people can use their ID for identification 37 
 (6.2%/3.9%), concern usi ng the ID as collateral for loans (7.3%/3.3%) and concern about 
mistakes on their National ID (2.5%/1.2%). Uganda presents a densely populated urban 
community which is prone to crime and as a result, there are more chances of urban residents 
feeling insecu re and unsafe compared to the rural residents. On the  other  hand , rural residents 
present an underserved population due to possible barriers related to affordability, accessibility 
and illiteracy related to the possession of a National ID.  
It is desirable  that programming should focus on equitable distribution of public services with 
focus on rural communities.   
 
People in the higher wealth category were more likely than lower wealth status participants to 
express fear about misuse of their IDs in fraudulent transactions (45.5%/38.1%; p<0.001) and 
to have negative cultural/religious beliefs about National IDs (3.1% /1.1%; p=0.001).  
 
Uganda recently passed a Data Protection and Privacy Act, 2019. The policy provides 
guidelines on how to protect the privacy of individuals and of personal data. It also regulates 
the collection and processing of personal information to provide for the rights of persons whose 
data is collected (Uganda Data protection and privacy Act, 2019). Further, Uganda is focusing 
on increasing National ID data security with the aim of building trust among both ID holders 
and third -party users. To ach ieve this, access to the National ID database is restricted to service 
delivery points after fulfilling specified requirements. Each third party is assigned a unique 
code for access to these databases.  This is envisaged to increase the utility of National  ID data 
as more users are likely to engage with the National ID system if they perceive the system to 
adequately maintain privacy and confidentiality and protect their information against 
fraudulent and malicious motives.  
 
NIRA ought to assure the populat ion of the safety of their data and to explain the measures 
used to keep the data safe. The existing misconceptions regarding National ID’s use as a tool 
for surveillance also need to be addressed. Robust, privacy -protecting m echanisms for third 
party user s of the National ID to securely tap into the National ID biometric database will 
reduce misuse of the National ID by non -owners.

 4.0 FINDINGS FROM THE COST -BENEFIT ANALYSIS  
4.1 Introduction  
In this section, the costs, the benefits and consequently a cost -benefit analysis of Uganda’s 
National ID program are presented. The perspective taken is that of the investors in the system 
i.e. the Government of Uganda. The limitation of this perspective is that it excludes the many 
socio -economic benefits to National ID holders, and to third -party users like telecom 
companies. These perspectives were excluded because of the challenge of attaching a valid 
monetary value to them. Noteworthy, t he benefits pr ovided in this section are only estimates 
based on assumption of the full use of the National ID during service delivery. The present 
analysis therefore answers the question: To what extent has the Government of Uganda 
benefited from its initial investment  into the National ID system?

4.2.1  Total cost of the activities involved in producing and issuing National IDs  
The estimated cost of the activities for producing and issuing Uganda’s national ID are 
presented in Table 14. The cost estimates are based on activities implemented during the mass 
National ID rollout in 2014/15 but do not include the costs of subsequent mop -up registration 
drives.

 The total cost of establishing and rolling out the National ID was about US$ 56,197,126. The 
main cost driver was enrolment (at 52%) closely followed by pre -enrolment (at 46%), while 
card issuance costs were substantially lower (2%). Table 16 shows the dis tribution of costs by 
recurrent and non -recurrent categories.

A substantial percentage (97%) of the costs were non -recurrent (or capital) costs.  
 
4.2.2 Cost per National ID issued  
The unit cost per ID shows partly the efficiency levels in the ID registration activities. Given 
that the target population and the activities to cover the target population are relatively fixed, 
one has to ensure that enrolment covers the entire target po pulation. It is important to note that 
while the mass roll out target was 18 million Ugandans, the reported target achieved was 14 
million (77.8%). The cost of producing and issuing one National ID was US$ 4.0.  
 
4.2.3 Present value of the costs of issuing the National IDs  
Over the five years since the initial investment, the present value of the costs of setting up the 
National ID system was estimated as the sum of discounted costs per year. This involved 
annualizing the different costs by applying discount factors over the five years (See Table 16). 
The total adjusted value of the costs associated with establishing the National ID is US$ 
37,951,536.

 4.2.4  Benefits of the National ID  
4.2.4. 1 Estimated benefits of the National ID system to government  
The benefits of a National ID system (actual and potential and in terms of both scale and scope) 
are dependent on coverage, robustness, and extent of integration of the system with other 
systems and processes. Currently, the benefits from the national ID h ave been mainly from 
government socio -economic empowerment (cash transfer) programs by reducing leakages, 
from payroll management in the public sector through elimination of ‘ghost workers’, and from 
savings from reducing duplicative administrative process es. The main program where benefits 
from elimination of duplicative administrative processes were quantifiable was the verification 
of citizen eligibility for voting. Note that even with the National ID in place, it is not the only 
artefact used for voter verification as often, several voters do not have one. The benefits 
provided here are therefore only estimates based on an assumption of its full use in voter 
verification. Table 17 shows the estimated benefits of the National ID to the government. It is 
important to note that not all programs have taken advantage of the national IDs to reduce 
expenditure leakages and only those for which such evidence is available are presented.

The total savings from losses prevented within four public social assistance programs, th at we 
were able to avail data on, was  US$ 1,879,622 in year 0. The total savings from payroll and 
pension -funds as a result of being able to weed out ‘ghost’ payees was US$ 10,197,531 in year 
0. The total estimated administrative savings by use of National  ID systems for voter 
verification was US$ 30,554,396 in year 0. In the present study, it was not possible to attach a 41 
 monetary value to the use of the National ID as a travel document, for regulation of 
telecommunications by the Uganda Communications Comm ission, and for the role it could 
play in identification of potential tax payers to broaden the tax -base. Potential areas where 
utility of the National ID could be leveraged to increase such savings are summarized in Table 
18.

4.2.4.2  Present value of benefits of the National ID system to government  
The present value of benefits was determined from the annualized savings over the five-year 
period of review by applying a discount factor of 5% to the savings from the public programs 
considered in the previous section over the five-year period. The total  present value of benefits 
realized from use in programs for which data is available is US$ 51,151,280. The computations 
are summarised in Table 19.

It is worth noting that the present value of benefits as computed based on discount rates is the 
minimum because savings from prevention of losses in Year 0 can also be potentially carried 
forward in full in subsequent years and can be invested in other critical programs. It is also 
worth noting that there are several programs where the data on the impact of the National ID  
is not available. For example, such data is not available from the following programs: (1) 
Pension management (Public Service); (2) Reduced Administrative costs (Local government); 
(3) Travel documentation (Immigration); (4) Tax efficiency (Revenue Authority); and (5) 
Regulation of communications (Commu nications Commission).  
 
4.2.5  Cost -Benefit Analysis  
Table 20 presents  the value of both the cost and benefits attained from the roll out of national 
ID are shown.

Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR)  1.35 
Net Present Value(NPV)  13,199,744  
1US$=UGX 3500   
 
From the Table 20, the benefit cost ratio is 1.35 which is higher than 1. Thus, for every US$1 
invested in the National ID system, the present return on investment is US$1.35. The project 
has a positive Net Present Value of US$ 13,199,744. The findings indicate that the gov ernment 
as an investor has realized and exceeded the value of the baseline investment from the roll out 
of the national ID by 35% as a result of savings from the few programs that had such data. 
However, the limited range of programs contributing to this e stimate indicates that much higher 
value could be derived if more programs availed of the National ID and collected relevant data.  
 
The study shows that the cost of setting up a National ID system in a developing country 
context is about US$ 56,197,126 whi le the five-year present value of these costs is about US$ 
37, 951,536. The minimum benefits from the few programs that could avail data is US$ 
30,554,396 which amounts to a minimum annualized value of US$ 51,151,280.  
 
Because a substantial part of the co sts related to establishing the National ID system were 
capital costs, it  will subsequently be less costly for the government to issue new IDs for 
Ugandans due to the investments made. However, much more could be achieved if the full 
benefits that such a s ystem can bring to the governance ecosystem are tapped into. To realize 
this, the government and its development partners will have to expand both the scale and the 
scope of usage of the national ID and to undertake actions to enhance the National ID’s use  as 
a single identification artefact. Indeed,  one of the key findings from previous studies in a similar 
country context  (World Bank 2017 ) is that the approach used to roll out National IDs within a 
country affects the cost benefit ratio .  Therefore, it is  imperative for NIRA to identify and 
promote solutions that enhance and maintain interoperability and security between National ID 
databases. This could be done by building and maintaining user trust in the system while 
leveraging benefits across all stake holders.  
 
Although there needs to be optimal coverage of population to attain any substantial benefits, 
high investments in intensive roll out such as enrolling through the lowest administrative level 
do not necessarily guarantee that all the targeted population wil l be reached. Since the target 
population at roll out is a constant (based on a targeted age group), there is a need to ensure an 
optimal balance of strategies to reach everyone (such as decentralized equipment and 
registration offices and sufficient durat ion of the mass registration periods).  In addition, those 
in the lowest wealth quintile were found to be more likely to bear costs and encounter 
challenges, as such , additional investment to foster inclusion of all members of society should  
be merited.  
 
The potential scope of benefits for national ID is wide  (World Bank 2016, Atick, J 2016) , 
broadly categorized across 3 main categories: (1) reducing leakages, (2) reducing 
administrative costs through reducing duplication and (3) potentially increased reven ue 
collection. However, the benefits identified for which quantitative data was readily available 43 
 were only those related to reducing leakages. Even within that dimension, not all potential 
avenues through which financial leakages can be reduced have been utilized in Uganda. For 
instance, within the Ministry of Public Service, only the payroll has been cleaned  to remove 
duplicates and ineligible beneficiaries  based on the National ID. There is potential for its use 
in cleaning the public pension scheme (managed by the Ministry of Public Service), and the 
private pension scheme (managed by the National Social Security Fund), and further 
strengthening of payroll related identi fication. For the cost savings/benefits attained from the 
cash transfer programs under the Ministry of Gender, the coverage in terms of beneficiaries 
was often low as these were often pilot projects or not yet fully scaled up to all the districts in 
the co untry. This implies that further  benefits may be attained if these cash transfer programs 
achieve the national coverage and if the use of the National ID as a verification tool for 
beneficiaries is scaled. Savings from prevention of losses as a result of s uch initiatives could 
be channelled into other critical programs. In addition, despite not being able to attach a 
monetary value within the scope of this study, the role of the National ID in driving the digital 
economy, especially through facilitating SIM  card registration should not be ignored.  
 
From the study, a key avenue from which massive cost savings could be leveraged is through 
reduction of duplicative processes. For instance, while the national ID could be used for citizen 
participation in electio ns, the ability to use the national ID for voting and eliminating processes 
for voter registration has not been fully utilized. The potential benefits of ensuring that the 
national ID also acts as a voter’s card would almost equate the full cost of investm ent (based 
on the estimated voter number  of 15,277,198, according to the Electoral Commission database 
of 2016 ). In a similar light, this study does not include the value of the socio -economic benefits 
of the National ID to the National ID holders i.e. the  general population, which can be 
potentially substantial if quantified. From the nation -wide community survey, four main 
categories of benefits to National ID holders emerged: (1) Economic and Financial inclusion, 
(2) Civil identification (3) Accessing bu reaucratic services and (4) Facilitating business or civil 
transactions. If a monetary value could be attached to the goods and services that result into 
these benefits, and if government views the benefits to National ID holders as part of their 
intended benefit, then the cost -benefit ratio could be a multiple of the present ratio. The cost -
benefit ratio can also be increased through expansion and inclusion of the benefits from third -
party users of the system. The increased efficiency and reliability of third-party  users’ 
identification systems as well as savings from unification of identification artefacts represents 
another avenue through which the benefits of National IDs could be much broader than the 
estimates from this study.  
 
This study is not witho ut limitations. The cost data obtained was mostly aggregated and this 
made it impossible to understand the cost structure of the process and the specific cost drivers 
within the processes. There was also a challenge in valuation of the benefits from cost s avings 
in implementation of some of the cash transfer programs such as Operational Wealth Creation 
(OWC), which provided in kind support varying in terms of items type and quantity (and hence 
value). Future studies could focus on being more granular in und erstanding the cost structure 
of national ID rollout with the intention of understanding the processes that could be optimized 
to attain more economic value from the rollout. Future research could explore  valuation of 
programs that provide non -cash transfe rs to prevent underestimation of cost savings of digital 
identification. In addition, studies could explore attaching  financial value to the socio -
economic benefits claimed in the quantitative household survey by individual ID holders. This 
can further inc lude understanding efficiency -related benefits claimed from the qualitative 
assessment of third -party users of the National ID system.

 APPENDICES  
 
Appendix 1: Methodology  
A1.1 Household survey of ID card holders  
A1.1.1 Study design  
The survey targeted adult Ugandans aged 18 years and above, the age at which possession of a 
national ID is mandatory. A household survey of adults expected to have national IDs involved 
drawing a statistically representative sample of participants from all 10 statistical regions of 
Uganda and administe ring a structured questionnaire.  
 
A1.1.2 Sample size  
The sa mpling strategy was developed in collaboration with the Ugand a Bureau of Statistics 
(UBOS). The sample size computation was based on the minimum sample size required to 
estimate the prevalence of NID ownership and use r experiences based on a two -stage cluster 
survey strategy. The total number of clusters (enumeration areas) required was computed using 
the formula by Benet et al (Benet et al 1991; Kumar and Indrayan 2002). Assuming that Z α, 
the standard normal deviate at  95% confidence (or a significance level of 0.05), is 1.96; (2) Z β, 
the standard normal deviate at 80% power is 0.84; (3) P, the percentage of Ugandans who claim 
to have benefitted from national IDs is 90%; (4) D, representing  a computed Design Effect of 
3, and (5) m, the non -response factor estimated at 1.05; (6) and b, the number of respondents 
to be selected per cluster is  households/respondents, substituting into this formula gave a 
sample size of 182 clusters. At 14 respondents per enumeration area, t he sample size for the 
households/participants was 2,548.  
 
The primary pu rpose of the main survey was  to estimate the prevalence of possession of 
national IDs and benefits to the users. However, to assess the outcomes of possessing a national 
ID, a c ompara tive analysis  was nested into the primary prevalence survey in which peopl e who 
have a national ID were compared on a range of socio -economic and other factors with those 
who do not have a national ID to determine the factors associated with NID ownership . The 
minimum sample size to enable comparisons was determined using the formula by Fleiss , for 
comparative studies  that assess  differences between proportions. Assuming that 65% of people 
with national IDs are able to access critical services like access t o micro -credit while only 45% 
of those without a national ID are able to access the same services, a confidence level of 95%, 
and a power of 90%, a minimum sample of 237 people without NIDs was re quired for the 
comparison . Of the Ugandans aged 16 years and  above, 12.4% are estimated not to have 
national IDs (Kahungu, 2019). A primary sample of 2,548 was therefore expected generate at 
least 316 people without national IDs. This number is therefore sufficient to provide the 
required sample of 234 people witho ut national IDs  required for the comparison analysis . 
 
A1.1.3 Sampling procedures  
All 15 statistical regions o f Uganda (as used in the national Healt h and Demographic Surveys ) 
were included in the study. The sampling was two -stage. The first stage involve d selection of  
182 enumeration areas allocated proportionate to the population sizes of the 15 statistical 
regions.  Thereafter, the enumeration areas in each statistical region were divided up between 
rural and urban EAs using the urb anization index for each region (Details of the allocations  are 
provided in the appendices). The 14 households from each enumeration area were selected 
using systematic sampling, and where multiple eligible participants (i.e. people aged 18 years 
and above) were present i n a household, one was selected using simple random sampling.  48

A1.1.4 Data collection tools and procedures  
Data was collected using an interviewer administered questionnaire co -created by the research 
team using  key constructs identified from a formative qualitative survey that preceded the 
household survey. The que stionnaire was translated into eight  languages spoken in the target 
regions (Luganda, Lugisu, Kumam, Acholi, Ruyoro -Rutooro, Runyankore -Rukiga, Lugbar a 
and Lusoga) and back -translated to ensure consistency.  
 
A total of 15 data collection teams were formed, each covering one statistical region . Each 
team was composed of  four experienced research assistants  and one supervisor, all able to 
speak the langua ges pertinent to their  allocated  region . Permission  to conduct the study was 
sought  from the district leadership.  At the sampled household level, the research assistants 
identified themselves, sought permission from the head of the household and where ther e was 
more than adult in the household, and conducted a random selection of one respondent. They 
then sought written consent from the sampled participant. The study questionnaire was adapted 
to an electronic format and delivered using ODK software on Andro id mobile phones.  
 
Questionnaire data from the ODK enabled devices was synced to a single server at the end of 
each day. The supervisors on each of the 15 teams reviewed  the submiss ions for consistency. 
They also held daily briefings with the Research Assistants . In addition  to the team leaders, an 
independent quality assurance team made spot -checks on a sample of 6 of the 18 districts  to 
assess compliance to agreed field procedures.  
 49 
 A1.1.5 Study variables and measurements  
The study variables were: (1) Background socio -demog raphic characteristics of participants; 
(2) Prevalence of NID ownership and associated factors, (3)Processes and experiences during 
acquisition of the national ID and associated costs, (3) Socio -economic benefits and value, 
experienced by investors, primar y users and third -party users of national digital identity cards 
in Uganda, (4)  Socio -economic harm and challenges experienced by investors, primary users 
and third -party users of national digital identity cards in Uganda  (5) Correlates of benefitting 
from the national digital identity system among ID users in Uganda . 
 
A1.1.6 Data management and a nalysis  
The data was synced to a server at RAN Makerere University School of Public Health where 
it was stored. Analysis was conducted using Stata 16 . Desc riptive statistics were used  to 
summarize the data by demographic factors such as age, gender, occupation, marital status and 
geographical location, prevalence of  NID ownership, experiences related to registration for the 
NID, NID maintenance, correction o f errors and replacement when lost, benefits of the NID 
and challenges. For categorical,  frequency counts and proportions were used while for 
numerical data, means, medians, standard deviation , and  range we re used. The socio -economic 
benefit categories of NIDs were derived using principal components analysis and categorized 
into tertiles. At bivariate and multi variate levels, factors associated with having an NID and 
factors associa ted with having experienced the  key benefits  of NIDs  were assessed using sim ple 
logistic regression ( for bivariate analysis) and Modifie d Poisson Regression (for multi variate 
analysis). Statistical significance was determined at α=0.005.  
 
A1.1.7 Ethical Considerations  
Before conducting the survey, the protocol and  all supporting documents wer e submitted to  the 
Makerere University School of Social Sciences Institutional Review Board (IRB) for review 
and approval. All comments and amendments raised by the IRB were addressed. 
Confidentiality  and anonymization of responses were mainta ined. Prior to administering the 
questionnaire  full informed consent was sought from each participant.  
 
 
A1.2 Evaluation of the e conomic benefit of national IDs to the investors  in 
the system  
A1.2.1 Study design  
The design of this study was a cost-benefit analysis. Information was collected on costs 
associated with establishment of the NID system as well as its roll out to users . Key informants 
from  key agencies that have a stake in the NID system  were interviewed  and the agencies’ 
financial records reviewed . The total itemized costs of setting up the NID system (non -
recurrent and recurrent) were documented and thereafter annualized for a reference period of 
five years. The total benefits claimed by different agencies linked to the N ID were computed 
and they too were annualized. Thereafter, a ratio of costs to benefits was computed to  
summarize  the economic benefit of setting up such a system.  
 
A1.2.2 Data collection teams, tools and variables  
Data was collected by research officers with graduate level training and with prior experience 
in collection of qualitative data. The Rese arch Officers were trained for two  days on both 
theoretical and practical concepts of economic evaluation for them to appreciate different types 
and sources o f the cost and benefit data and how best to extract this data. A semi -structured 50 
 key informant guide was used. This guide was developed using the cost and benefit categories 
identified from the formative qualitative study that preceded this assessment. Giv en that some 
variables required that officers are given time to extract and avail the data, the data collection 
teams made multiple call -backs until the relevant data w as fully obtained. Variables were  
collected in t wo main domains: (1) Sources of  costs an d the monetized value of the costs, and 
(2) Sources of benefit and the monetized value of benefits.  
 
A1.2.3 Approach to computation of costs and benefits  
Approach to the cost computation:  To undertake a cost benefit analysis, it was necessary to 
capture all the cost components requ ired to establish the system  are covered. The ingredients 
costing approach was used where the different cost categories are identified based the defined 
scope and perspective together with their component cost activities and the  resources required 
for accomplishing these activities. A  quantification is then conducted of how much resources 
were used and the financial value of the resources. The computation included both financial 
and economic costs. Financial costs focus on outlay s/flows while economic costs include both 
financial outlays and opportunity cos t of all inputs included in the  process. Estimation of 
economic costs included valuation of time, supplies, equipment as well as annuali zation of 
costs by adjusting using  a disc ount rate over a five-year period since establishment of the NID. 
Costs were considered in both local currency units as well as US dollars (converted based on 
mid-year exchange rates). Although the intende d coverage of the national ID was  every 
Ugandan national, costing was limited  to the population covere d in the mass enrolment period. 
The cost s were defined guided by  needs at the different stages of the digital identification cycle 
as shown in the figures below:

The pre -enrolment phase was expected to include: (1) Physical infrastructure, (2) 
Establishment of natio nal standards and policies (3) c entral le vel personnel recruitment, (4) 
awareness creation for users, (5) t raining and capacity building (techn ical and process related), 
(6) d esign, architecture, procurement an d installation  of IT infrastructure. The enrolment phase 
was undertaken by NIRA in partnership with other stakehol ders. This phase included: (1) 
 
Identification 
life cycle  
 
51 
 operationalization of IT infrastruc ture (hardware, software), (2) r ecruitment of enrolment field 
office rs up to parish level, and (3) c o-ordination of enrolment activities. After enrolment, the 
collected information was transferred to the central data base where the process of  verification 
and deduplication was undertaken. Thereafter, Unique Identification Numbers (NIN)1 and IDs  
were  prepared for issuance. The core cost categories  for this process therefore were : (1) Human 
resources, (2) ID credentials (printing of cards), (3)  Central IT infrastructure –computers, 
scanners, (4) Infrastructure/Physical establishments, (5) Enrolment IT Infrastructure and (6) 
Information Education communication.  
 
Approach to the  benefit estimation: The benefits of Uganda’s  national ID were based o n 
those that were  confirmed to have been achieved, guided by preliminary information obtained 
the formative qualitative survey. The per spective taken was that of the G overnment of Uganda, 
referred to as ‘ the investors in the system ’. The mechanisms for ben efits included: Increased  
efficiency ( through reduced leakage/fraud and administrative cost), increased tax collection 
and cost recovery through charging fees.  These mechanisms are summarized in the table 
below:

Focus was put  mainly on the efficiency gains and less on the fiscal/revenue issues  due to non -
availability of data for the latter. The gains for which data was available included: Reducing 
fraud, leakage and ‘ghost’ beneficiaries in pay -roll o r pension systems, preventing tax evasion 
and reducing high transaction costs that result from a lack of foundational identification  (e.g. 
in voter identification) . The target source systems for this information  were  bench -marked with

social welfare programs to the ID system, (2) streamlining election administration, (3) 
facilitating easier KYC for banks, the financial sector, and telecom companies, and (4) 
prevent ing money laundering (WB 2018) .   
 
A1.2.4 Data Management and Analysis  
The estimation of the value that identification systems provide to those who invest in them was  
be asse ssed using cost -benefit analysis. The figure below summarises the process:  
 
Figure 2: Framework for cost benefit analysis for Uganda’s national ID  system  
 
 
Computation of Benefit Cost Ratio and Net Present Value:  To undertake a cost benefit 
analysis, the following ratios were computed:  (1) BCR is the ratio of the discounted project 
monetar y benefits over its entire life span a nd the discounted project costs (see equation (1 )) 
 
Equation 1:  
𝑩𝑪𝑹=∑𝑩𝒕
(𝟏+𝒓)𝒕𝒏
𝒕=𝟏
∑𝑪𝒕
(𝟏+𝒓)𝒕𝒏
𝒕=𝟏 
 
(2) NPV is the difference between the total discounted benefits minus the total discounted costs 
(see equation (2)).  
 
Equation 2:  𝑵𝑷𝑽=𝑩𝒕
(𝟏+𝒓)𝒕−𝑪𝒕
(𝟏+𝒓)𝒕 
 
Where: (1) Bt = the benefit in year t (where t = 0 to n  years); (2) Ct = the costs in year t (where 
t = 0 to n  years) and n = the total number of years for the project duration/life span; r = the 
discount rate (5% for this study). Regarding interpretation, if the NPV>0, then the project

 generates returns greater than the investment and hence is desirable. Likewise , if the Net benefit 
is greater than  the N et cost (i.e. BCR>1), then the project is considered desirable. The bigger 
the benefit -cost ratio the more desirable the investment is. When BCR<1, then the project is 
not desirable.
