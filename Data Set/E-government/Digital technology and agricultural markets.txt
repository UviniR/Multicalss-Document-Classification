Digital technologies have a high potential to enable further development of the 
agricultural sector, significantly reshape food value chains (FVCs), and greatly 
contribute towards more productive, resilient and transparent food systems. This paper 
provides a non-technical overview of digital technologies that have a high potential 
to revolutionize the agriculture and food industry, and contribute towards inclusion 
of small farmers into FVCs. The particular focus is on digital platforms providing  
e-commerce services and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), such as blockchain, as they 
mutually enable more efficient and more inclusive local and global agricultural markets by 
tackling their contribution to reducing information asymmetries, transaction costs, and providing 
financial inclusion of actors along FVCs. V arious examples indicate that digital technologies 
represent great potential benefits for small farmers including increased efficiency of production, 
direct access to market, inclusion in global value chains (GVCs), and access to finance and 
insurance services. The further potential of digital technologies, especially blockchain, could 
change existing linear food value chain models by providing more transparency and trust 
between the supply chain actors. Finally, by using digital technologies, governments can provide 
more efficient public services. Overall, the real impact of digital technologies on the agriculture 
and food industry will be more evident in the years to come when they become widely accepted 
by all involved actors, and their usage reaches a critical scale. The role of governments will 
be significant in enabling adequate environments for innovations and further technological 
development. |  v  ||  v  |Contents

Introduction|  3  ||  3  |1 Introduction 
The emergence of industry 4.01 has set the basis for a broad spectrum of digital technologies2. 
The tremendous development of wireless communication and networking has enabled the 
emergence of “low”-tech mobile applications and digital platforms that provide users with access 
to valuable information. On the other side, the “high”-tech integrated management systems 
supported by the Internet of things (IoT), “big data”  analytics, distributed ledger technology 
(DLT), and artificial intelligence (AI) provide overall connectivity between “smart”  devices and 
humans, transforming how products are designed, produced and consumed. Whether low- 
or high-tech, implemented by users or by external service providers, the main incentive for 
adopting digital technologies lies in the expectations of users to find solutions to existing or 
emerging challenges (Jouanjean, 2019). 
There are many constraints for small farmers3 to get engaged in the formal economy. Most of 
them lack market information and do not produce enough (in volume) to incentivize actors 
along the food value chain (FVC)4 to get into a formal trade relationship with them. High market 
entry costs, followed by high transaction costs and exclusion from financial services – such as 
the ability to open a bank account or obtain credit – creates additional constraints. Furthermore, 
traditional FVCs consist of several intermediaries that are engaged in business activities between 
farmers and consumers. In this business environment, farmers receive only a small proportion 
of the final product price, while at the same time consumers do not have any connection with 
farmers as final products are mainly labelled by processing companies or retail chains. Thus, 
transparency along FVCs is becoming one of the most essential factors for gaining the trust of 
consumers (Tripoli and Schmidhuber, 2018). 
Agricultural and food trade faces significant challenges as well. Changes to domestic 
and international trade policies, characterized by significant decreases in tariffs, has 
supported a tremendous increase in trade flows and a number of new actors involved 
in global agricultural trade. These changes have brought about two significant trends:  
1) increased trade for emerging and developing countries; and 2) a rapid development of Global 
V alue Chains (GVCs)5 (Greenville et al ., 2019). Nevertheless, the process of global market 
integration, enabled by reduced tariffs and transport costs, has also resulted in higher transaction 
costs, as many actors of the GVCs have to deal with more distant partners that operate under 
different legislations and rules (World Bank, 2019a; Goldfarb and T ucker, 2019). Thus, finding 
a reliable trading partner has become a significant cost burden. With better information flows, 
that avoid information asymmetries, actors involved in agricultural trade would be able to 
reduce transaction costs and thus engage in more efficient contractual agreements with other 
GVC actors – contractual relationships that are opposite to horizontal or vertical integration 
(North, 1990).
 
1  The term industry 4.0 refers to the fourth industrial revolution characterized by rapid transformation of business operations and products enabled by digital technologies and the Internet 
(European Parliament, 2015).
2  In this paper, digital technologies refer to the devices, systems, electronic tools and software that are able to generate, store or process data.
3  There are many definitions of small farmers in the literature. The definition of small farmers in this paper refers to those with less than 2 hectares of cropland (for different definitions, 
see FAO, 2017).
4  Food Value Chain (FVC) consists of all the stakeholders who participate in the coordinated production and value adding activities that are needed to make food products (Source FAO: 
http://www.fao.org/sustainable-food-value-chains/what-is-it/en/ ). In this paper, term FVC refers to both domestic and global food value chains, DVCs and GVCs, respectively. 
5  If any stage of the FVC takes place out of the national border – in other country or many countries – the term Global Value Chain (GVC) is used.|  4  |
Digital technology and agricultural marketsDigital technologies are a promising tool for FVC actors to overcome some of the previously 
mentioned challenges. According to Trendov et al. (2019), in the next decade, the agricultural 
system, and especially FVCs, will face dramatic changes due to the emergence of digital 
technologies. It is already well recognized that digital technologies represent an important 
tool for achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)6 related to 
more productive, resilient, sustainable, and transparent FVCs and food systems in general. 
Furthermore, the emergence of specific digital tools and technologies, such as digital platforms 
– a digital tool based on different digital technologies – offering e-commerce services, and DLTs 
such as blockchain, has been recognized as a possible solution to some of the critical problems 
facing small farmers today: 1) How can small farmers be included in the formal economy and 
overcome high transaction costs and information asymmetries? 2) How can they become 
directly linked with consumers and reduce or eliminate middleman? 3) How can small farmers 
be included in FVCs and even become a part of the GVCs? and 4) How can they access capital 
and how could their incomes be improved? 
Implementation of digital technologies along FVCs, supported by integration processes of 
small farmers into GVCs, creates a data-intensive transformation of the agricultural sector. This 
transformation enables increasing demand for information along FVCs through the creation 
of digital data for both agricultural assets and production processes. Data generated through 
primary agriculture, mainly collected within the IoT system, are streamed through FVCs vis-à-vis  
both horizontal and vertical integration processes. Using “high-tech”  technologies, such as AI, 
big data analytics, cloud computing and blockchain, data is stored, processed and transformed 
into decision-making tools. Thus, data plays a key role in the digital transformation of the 
agriculture and food industry. On the other side, the need for data results in concentration of 
power in the agricultural and food industry/sector, as data is recognized as the “fuel”  for further 
profit increases of large companies.
The main aim of this paper is to provide a critical discussion on how existing digital tools, namely 
digital platforms, and digital frontier technologies, such as DLT (for example, blockchain), AI, 
and Additive Manufacturing Technology (3D printing) affect agricultural and food markets. A 
special focus is on identifying if selected technologies are accessible and enable inclusion of small 
farmers into FVCs. Furthermore, with a focus on digital technologies, policy recommendations 
are provided to strengthen the contribution of agricultural and food markets to sustainable 
development.
At present, it is challenging to evaluate the impact of the digital transformation on the agri-
food sector and trade, as many digital technologies have only recently emerged (for example, 
blockchain, AI and 3D printing) and are still in an infancy phase of adoption. Thus, the real impact 
of these digital frontier technologies on agricultural development and trade will be made more 
evident in coming years when their usage reaches a critical scale. To enable wide technology 
adoption and to realize the benefits of digital technologies, cooperation between all stakeholders 
involved in agriculture and the food industry (for example, farmers, the private sector, researchers, 
government and non-profit organisations) is required. Certainly, governments will play a crucial 
role in enabling the digital environment, where policymakers have to reshape existing policies 
or create new regulations related to data privacy, interoperability of technologies, and possible 
liability issues.
6  Digital tools and technologies implemented in agriculture and FVCs have the potential to advance the following SDGs: SDG 2 – Zero hunger; SDG 6 – Availability and sustainable 
management of water; SDG 8 – Decent work and economic growth; SDG 9 – Industry, innovation and infrastructure; SDG 11 – sustainable cities and communities; SDG 12 – 
Responsible consumption and production; SDG 14 and 15 – Life on land and below water; and SDG 17 – Partnership for the goals. |  5  |1. Introduction
This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a critical review of selected digital tools 
and digital frontier technologies that contribute to more efficient and inclusive local and global 
markets. Section 3 provides an overview of necessary preconditions for digital technology 
adoption, accessibility, and inclusion of small farmers into GVCs. How digital technologies 
enable creation of new market structures and enhance public services is discussed in section 4. 
Finally, section 5 provides conclusions and policy implications.CHAPTER 2
Digital technologies and Food Value Chains|  9  ||  9  |2 Digital technologies and Food Value Chains 
This section provides a non-technical overview of selected digital tools and digital frontier 
technologies that have a high potential to revolutionize the agriculture and food industry. Hence, 
the main focus is on digital platforms that provide e-commerce services, that is, a digital tool that 
could facilitate mix of different digital technologies; distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) (for 
example, blockchain) that have the potential of providing high-level transparency, data security, 
and trust among FVC members; artificial intelligence (AI) used for improving FVC efficiency by 
reducing market uncertainties through predictive analytics; and additive manufacturing technology  
(3D printing) to indicate a possible direction of FVC transformation in the future  
(see Figure 1). Most of these selected technologies are currently in their infancy phase of 
both development and adoption. It will probably take several years or decades until they 
show their full potential and become widely adopted by agri-food industry stakeholders 
and FVC actors. Furthermore, to unlock their full potential, most of these technologies 
are usually combined into one digital product or service that is usually provided to  
end-users via digital platforms.

Digital technology and agricultural markets2�1 Digital platforms 
Supported by significant technological development and the spread of national mobile Internet 
networks, digital platforms7 offer easy to use e-commerce services. Having access to a platform 
provides farmers, regardless of size, the opportunity to have a direct link with buyers of their 
products. Thus, access to markets is one of the first obstacles, especially for small farmers, that 
could potentially be eliminated with the emergence of e-commerce digital platforms (hereafter 
digital platforms). Nevertheless, there are additional core problems common to all markets: 1) 
How to deal with varying quality levels of the same products delivered by numerous farmers 
(quality standards); 2) How to overcome the issue of extremely high costs for small shipments; 
and 3) How to physically deliver fresh products on time. These are also core obstacles for farmers 
when it comes to becoming engaged in both domestic and global value chains. Together with 
intensive technological developments, some types of digital platforms are able to tackle the 
complex issue of logistics by manually controlling the quality of delivered products and providing 
a guarantee for buyers that products satisfy specific quality standards (Joiner and Okeleke, 
2019). Nevertheless, in many developing countries, digital platforms are not taking on this 
responsibility – and thus farmers have more incentives to continue trading with intermediaries 
that are more flexible on quality issues (Kumar, 2014). Furthermore, the issue of small and 
costly individual shipments has been resolved by aggregating them into large batches, taking 
advantage of economies of scale. Some of the digital platforms provide physical logistics hubs 
and warehousing services that are usually located near consumers, thus reducing shipment costs 
and delivery times (see Box 1). These digital platforms usually have a business model that is: 1) 
capital intensive, and 2) considered the highest level of FVC integration and control (Joiner and 
Okeleke, 2019). This business model has a high level of financial risk, as the platform provider 
has to be sure that their storage capacities will be efficiently utilized and that farmers will fulfil 
their obligations to provide sufficient products that are ordered by buyers. In order to reduce the 
supply risk, some platforms create legal obligations through contracts with farmers detailing 
minimum quantities to be purchased by the platform during one season.
7  The definition of a digital platform in this paper refers to the definition provided by the OECD: “… an online platform is a digital service that facilitates interactions between two or more 
distinct but independent sets of users (whether firms or individuals) who interact through the service via the Internet” OECD (2019a, p. 21).  |  11  |2. Digital technologies and Food Value Chains

To support farmers, and thus secure sufficient and on-time supply, some platforms even provide 
pre-financing to their members. Furthermore, being a member of a platform can provide access 
to the crowdfunding networks that usually originate in big cities where consumers are concerned 
about the working conditions of farmers and are ready to support sustainable production and fair 
financial payments. Depending on the underlying technology, some digital platforms provide 
payment possibilities such as mobile, tokens and cryptocurrency payments. Digital payments 
are peer-to-peer and done instantaneously – without time delay and intermediaries – enabling 
farmers to immediately reinvest in production, purchase additional machinery or inputs, or 
exchange their digital money for the national currency (see Box 4). There is little evidence on 
acceptance of mobile money systems within FVCs. Nevertheless, some evidence indicates that 
once digital payments are implemented and widely accepted, the development of other financial 
services can be expected – such as savings, credits and insurance (Babcock, 2015).
Although e-commerce digital platforms provide many potential benefits for farmers, the there 
are several critical issues related to: 1) How economically sustainable are digital platforms’  
business models? 2) Is there a risk of these platforms gaining a monopoly within markets? and 
3) How is farmers’  data used? 
Following the idea of Moore (1993), Teece (2017) states that the business ecosystem (for example, 
the digital platform) consists of four phases: 1) the creation of a system enabled by innovation; 2) 
the expansion of the system through a scalable business model that pushes out the competition; 
3) the leadership phase, during which the system maintains engaged clients; and 4) the self-
renewal phase where new ideas are introduced and implemented. Thus, the business model of 
digital platforms has to be economically sustainable and self-renewed through innovations in 
order to survive on the market. Gaining a critical mass of farmers to join the platform and stay 
active requires tremendous effort and financial means. Moreover, building trust is a long-term 
process that requires an adequate business strategy. If many digital platforms appear and then 
quickly vanish from the market, it creates distrust among farmers, making entry into the market 
for new platforms very difficult. |  12  |
Digital technology and agricultural marketsOn the other hand, if a well-established platform suddenly disappears from the market, it will 
cause high transition costs for farmers in finding another platform and buyers, especially if a 
particular digital platform was dominant in the market and most of the local farmers became 
dependent on that platform. By having market power, providers of the digital platform might 
cause a new “information asymmetry”, which could lead to reduced transparency and a lowering 
of farmers’  incomes.
Another critical issue is data handling: Data collected from farmers indeed represents critical enabler 
of digital platforms. To improve their service, or to create new ones, digital platforms have to rely on data 
received from their users. Transparency in data handling by platforms becomes an important trust-
building mechanism between platforms (service providers) and users (producers and consumers). 
Strict regulations of data-handling procedures and privacy concerns are becoming an obstacle for  
scaling-up digital platforms in some developed countries, while, on the other 
hand, it might not be a problem in some developing countries with loose data-
handling regulations (Rossotto et al ., 2018). Beyond data directly provided by farmers, 
many digital platforms are collecting a large amount of data from users’  activities  
(for example, location, demographics, prior purchases or sold items, to name a few) without 
transparently indicating how they use and disclose this data. Most of this data is used for targeted 
advertising purposes and is shared with third parties (ACCC, 2019).
Despite many open questions, digital platforms offering e-commerce services have been used 
for many years, confirming that the concept brings about many benefits. Thus, with further 
emergence of new technologies, e-commerce digital platforms will be able to offer different 
services to end users and contribute to further development of FVCs.  
2�2 Distributed ledger technology (DLT)
Distributed ledger technology (DLT), in its core sense, is a database that is spread between many 
computers, or nodes, to avoid intermediaries and allow for peer-to-peer interactions. Thus, there 
is no central authority that governs the whole process. There are different types of DLTs such as 
blockchain, Tangle, Hashgraph or sidechain. Different DLT types mainly differ in the type of data 
structure used and consensus mechanisms, that is, how different nodes agree on the data that 
should be stored on the ledger (El Ioini and Pahl, 2018). 
Indeed – as it represents the underlying technology for Bitcoin cryptocurrency – the most known 
DLT is a blockchain introduced in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto8. The main characteristic of the 
blockchain, compared to all other DLTs, is that data (for example, transactions) are recorded on 
blocks that are linked with hash codes, thus forming a chain of blocks. A consensus mechanism 
is used for making a mutual decision of the nodes to allow a particular block to be added to the 
chain. As each block in the chain references the previous block, if anyone tries to change the 
data in a particular block, a change in a hash of that particular block will result, leading instantly 
to a loss in the link with previous blocks. To make changing the data of the block possible, 
an agreement of the network majority is required. Considering the number of nodes that are 
actively involved on the network and the costs of such action, that is, the energy usage required 
to perform the computational efforts of such action, altering blockchain data is nearly impossible, 
rendering blockchain an effectively immutable ledger with tamper-proof data. Thus, supported 
with the latest technology in cryptography, blockchain represents a highly secured ledger that is 
8  It is not clear whether Satoshi Nakamoto is a person or group of people that are using this pseudonym.|  13  |2. Digital technologies and Food Value Chains
managed by the peer-to-peer network collectively, with no central authority present to confirm 
all transactions. 
Depending on whether the usage of a blockchain-based end user product is permissioned or 
permissionless, it provides transparency and traceability of transactions and data either for 
members of the “chain”  (for example, a group of members that control application, that is based 
on blockchain technology) or for the public, respectively (FAO, 2019). The two most known 
public or permissionless DLTs are Bitcoin blockchain and Ethereum, these are decentralized 
digital platforms that host the blockchain database. The Ethereum platform brought along one 
of the key advantages of DLTs: smart contracts. Smart contracts represent a piece of code that 
contains pre-determined conditions set by parties involved in a transaction, with the capability 
of self-executing once pre-defined conditions are met. Smart contracts should not be understood 
as a digital version of the traditional legally accepted paper version of contracts, but rather a 
simple set of actions that would be triggered depending on whether a particular condition is met 
or not (Deshpande et al., 2017). 
Although blockchain was first used for managing Bitcoin cryptocurrency, the advantages 
offered by this technology made it attractive for many different sectors – from agriculture to the 
aerospace industry. Regarding the agriculture and food industry specifically, most of DLT-based 
applications (mainly blockchain based)9 are currently used as a “proof-of-concept”, with the aim 
of trying to provide a solution to core challenges. 
There are several examples where the blockchain features are considered as a potential solution 
to certain FVC challenges. As an example, blockchain might be a particularly useful tool for 
governments and, especially, the retail sector, when it comes to food safety regulations. In 
situations like food scandals or foodborne disease outbreaks, traceability of products from farm 
to fork, provenance (tracking the place of origin, ingredients and quality), transparency and trust 
are immediately placed on the forefront of political agendas10. Furthermore, several companies 
have implemented blockchain technology as a tool for consumers to gain trust in their products 
(see Box 2). 
Providing transparency along the supply chain could potentially lead to a shift of power on the 
side of farmers. Consumers might be willing to support those FVCs that provide transparency 
on how added value is distributed among the actors. The particular focus of consumers might 
be on the farmers’  position within the chain, and whether they receive a “fair“ share of the final 
product’s price. 
Nevertheless, besides providing solutions from the consumers’  side, blockchain technology 
has been found to have applications in solving more practical problems within FVCs. These 
problems include contract relations, trust between stakeholders, tracking ownership information, 
facilitating trade, providing access to capital, and many more. One of the characteristics of 
agriculture is that labour-intensive work is necessary during certain months of the year. Usually, 
the harvest of many products requires a large number of workers for a set length of time. Thus, 
a farmer or agricultural company has to deal with many temporary work contracts. Often, these 
contracts lack transparency in social security provided by the employer and are usually linked 
to low wages and insecurity for workers (sometimes leading to forced work), which could be a 
9  When discussing the application of the DLT (e.g. blockchain) in FVCs, the discussion is related to end-user (“frontend”) applications that are based on DLT technology and not about the 
core technology (e.g. the “backend” database that stays on the decentralized network, e.g. Ethereum network, and connects with “frontend” applications).
10  The European Parliament introduced the General Food Law in 2002, making it obligatory for food and feed operators to introduce traceability systems (EU, 2007). This law was 
supported by the creation of a Trade Control and Expert System (TRACES) to track animals within the European Union and from so-called third countries.|  14  |

Company:  Provenance (the United States of America) was established in 2013 to empower companies, their products and the entire supply 
chains to be more transparent and traceable. 
Core challenge:  Consumers know little about the products they use every day. Some products have a long journey from the place of creation 
to consumers. On this journey, products pass through different supply chain stages wherein each stage, some modification is completed, 
bringing about increased costs for companies and higher prices for the consumer. The whole process is a black box where the consumer is 
not aware of certain negative things associated with the product they buy, such as environmental damage, unsafe work conditions, forgery, 
and many more.      
Solution:  A blockchain-based digital platform that uses digital tools to assemble images, self-evidence claims and locations to create a 
transparency foundation. Furthermore, Provenance uses different labels and smart tags (labels that contain transponder – chip and antenna) 
to link physical products with digital tools. The partnership with certifiers, auditors and data providers is established to ensure verification of 
information to the point of sale all along the supply chain.

transparency of working contracts to the legal authorities (Pinna and Ibba, 2017). Each 
temporary work contract, fully complying with national legislation, could be registered on the 
public (permissionless) blockchain. Thus, contracts become immutable, and every relevant legal 
authority would have full access to the contract at any time. Also, once the agreed-upon work 
is done, smart contracts activate immediate payments to employees, indicating wage levels 
and whether the employer paid for all necessary social contributions. A few pilot projects are 
trying to place contractual relations along the FVC on the blockchain. As an example, the Coca-
Cola Company joined forces with the Blockchain Trust Accelerator to pilot a project focused on 
creating transparent and verification-efficient labour policy controls within their GVC. The aims 
of these efforts are to prevent any possibilities of child labour, forced labour, and any land rights 
issues connected to their sugar supply chain around the world (Reuters, 2018). 
Another common problem that is important for the inclusion of farmers into FVC is 
how to trust other members of the FVC. The costs of conducting due diligence for a 
new partner might be extremely high, especially if the partner is in another country. 
This might be the leading cause of why many farmers are not involved in GVCs and stay 
connected to the same local buyers for years – even if a new partner appears offering 
higher prices. The risk of not being paid or receiving financial benefits too late is high.  
A further problem is how to match ownership transfer with a traded asset to achieve final 
payments. This is especially the case with grains, as it can be difficult and costly to follow the whole 
batch of grains from producer to the final product. There are some indications that blockchain 
technology might offer a solution, as a digital title can be provided for physical commodities and 
digital payments can be executed between parties involved instantaneously, for example, once |  15  |2. Digital technologies and Food Value Chains
the commodity is delivered or quality has been proven (see Box 3).
Blockchain technology might also have a significant impact on the financial inclusion of small 
farmers, especially those that do not have access to banks or do not have collateral to obtain 
credit. The blockchain solution could be built around the fact that all information regarding a 
particular farmer can be recorded on the blockchain and used as a track record for financial 
institutions to allow them to assess a farmer’s eligibility for obtaining credit (see Box 4). A 
similar concept could be used to provide small farmers with the opportunity to obtain insurance 
for their production by using smart contracts and automated payments. By using sensors for 
monitoring weather status, combined with data from local weather stations, and storing data on 
a blockchain, any potential adverse weather incidents would quickly trigger a smart contract on 
a blockchain and thus initiate digital payments to the farmers according to the assessed damage.
Further usage of blockchain is related to facilitating agricultural trade, one of the main components 
of GVCs. It is well known that agricultural trade is very complex, combining a large number 
of parties and a plethora of documents (for example, letters of credit, bills of lading, trading 
slips, different certificates, customs declarations, etc.). Also, trade finance plays a crucial role in 
trade facilitation – about 80 percent of global trade is financed by some financing instruments 
(WTO, 2016). The main contribution of blockchain technology can be seen in improving trade 
efficiency by enabling paperless trade (Ganne, 2018). As yet few examples exist of real-use 
cases of blockchain in international agricultural trade – the most known example refers to the 
export of 60 000 tonnes of soybeans from the United States of America to China. This trade was 
conducted by Louis Dreyfus Co., which joined forces with the Chinese Shandong Bohi Industry 
Co. (agricultural processor) together with financing groups consisting of the ING Group, Société 
Générale and ABN Amro Bank. This consortium used a blockchain-based digital platform to 
trial agricultural trade.  According to Louis Dreyfus Co., the main benefit of using the blockchain 
was matching data in real-time, avoiding duplications in the products’  checking procedures, and 
achieving a five times faster document processing compared to traditional trade.|  16  |
Digital technology and agricultural marketsBox 3 Blockchain for ownership transfer within food value chains
Company:  AgriDigital (Australia) was founded in 2015 to create a cost-effective, efficient and world-leading agri-commodity management 
and supply chain solution.
Core challenge:  Complexity of supply chains where most of the information and data handling is done manually involving a large number 
of participants. A particular problem arises when trying to match payments with title and asset transfer, bringing about a lack of transparency 
and trust within the FVC.
A particular focus in agriculture:  mainly grains.
Solution:  Development and implementation of the AgriDigital commodity management platform and blockchain application. The pilot test of 
the blockchain application was conducted together with Blue Lake Milling (subsidiary of the CBH) and considered a sequence of actions: 
1) a digital record of delivered oats from producer to the mill; 2) the creation of a digital title token on the blockchain that was stored on a 
producer’s digital wallet (online service that allows an individual to make electronic transactions); 3) once the mill confirmed the quality of 
delivered oats, a smart contract was activated causing an instantaneous exchange of title from producer to the buyer, and at the same time 
the transaction of payment from buyer to consumer. The payment was made using an “Agricoin” token (that is, cryptocurrency, 1 Agricoin is 
equal to 1 Australian Dollar).

Finally, there are numerous other possibilities of using blockchain technology – and especially 
smart contracts – in the agriculture and food industry. There are several such projects (pilots): 
land-use regulation projects in India, Sweden and Georgia; subsidy distribution in India; 
prevention of illegal fishing in New Zealand; providing regulations for the forestry sector in 
Spain and China; providing digital payments to small farmers in Pakistan and Jordan, and many 
more (FAO, 2019). 
Overall, DLT development is in an infancy phase, national standards related to DLT have not 
been developed in many countries and, often, governments’  fear of DLT is very high. Thus, 
different countries react differently when it comes to policy regulations. As an example, in 
Bangladesh, it is not possible to hold a cryptocurrency, while in China and Saudi Arabia trading 
cryptocurrencies or conducting Indicial Coin Offerings (ICOs) is not allowed. According to 
Deloitte (2016), regulatory bodies have to develop the necessary skills to be able to understand 
the activities taken on the ledger to assure compliance with existing national regulations or to 
identify which legislation segment should be adjusted to correspond towards real market needs.|  17  |2. Digital technologies and Food Value Chains
Box 4  Blockchain for the financial inclusion of small farmers
Company:  AGRI-WALLET (Kenya) was founded in 2015 to ensure that all actors in the FVC are well financed (source: www.agri-wallet.
com). 
Core challenge:  Many small farmers worldwide have a severe challenge in getting access to financial services. One of the main reasons 
is that they lack credit scores or collaterals, creating uncertainties and high risks for financial institutions to provide any services. 
Particular focus:  Finances in agriculture.
Solution:  Agri-wallet is a free digital wallet accessed by farmers in Kenya via a mobile phone application. When farmers earn revenue, 
they have two options. First, they can decide to be paid in fiat currency (through M-Pesa) or partially in digital tokens. Tokens are saved in 
their Agri-wallet. By saving tokens, farmers are allowed to get a short-term loan from Rabobank.

technology.
Apart from the tremendous potential of the DLTs, and especially blockchain, there are many 
critical issues when it comes to accessibility and adoption by end users. The core problem with 
DLT adoption starts with the question of whether it is needed at all. This decision is usually 
made at the top managerial level of the specific FVC, as it requires consensus of all FVC actors. 
According to a study by Wüst and Gervais (2018), blockchain technology sometimes doesn’t 
outperform existing data-handling systems within companies or value chains. Wider adoption 
depends on whether stakeholders will recognize the advantage of using blockchain and change 
their existing business model. As an example, in the United States of America, the attempts to 
digitalize trade finance through the introduction of bank payment obligations ended up with 
high investments by both government and technology providers, but had a very slow acceptance 
by traders (Ehmke, 2019). For this reason, many traders in the United States of America have 
raised doubts about broader adoption of blockchain technology as well.    
Selection of a suitable DLT is of a great importance as different DLTs and their hosting platforms 
are not compatible, and thus a decision to later switch from one DLT to another might cause 
significant costs. As an example, it is expected that DLTs are able to store large volume of real-
time data recorded from all sorts of sensors and IoT devices. Nevertheless, at the current stage 
of technological development blockchain is mainly storing references to different databases (Ge 
et al., 2017). On the other side, emerging technology Tangle, a DLT based on directed acyclic 
graph, is developed with an aim of allowing communication between IoT devices. Furthermore, 
DLT selection greatly depends on the governance system of the hosting platforms. One of the 
critical issues for both permissioned and permissionless ledgers is how to set clear governance 
rules, given their distributed nature (Mills et al., 2016). Different DLT platforms rely on different 
developer communities that can make a consensus on changing specific rules, directly affecting 
users of the platform. The size of the developer community might be a sign as to whether certain 
technology will be further developed and maintained. If number of developers significantly 
reduces, this might be an indicator that the community using a particular technology does not |  18  |
Digital technology and agricultural marketshave incentives to further use it or do not see importance of this technology in the future (possibly 
as a result of the emergence of another technology). Thus, previous explanations indicate that 
FVCs have to consider different business strategies in order to achieve resilient business model. 
Once the need for a certain DLT is recognized, the question of who will govern the initial 
inclusion of the FVC actors arises. Given previously described complexity in understanding DLT 
and selecting the proper technology (for example, blockchain), it is reasonable to expect that the 
initiative will follow a top-down approach, where the downstream sector of the FVC (namely, 
retailers), take over a lead. This process could be similar to the certification rules imposed from 
retailers towards the upstream levels of the FVCs (that is, processors and producers). In order 
to obtain traceability of products and transparency for consumers, retailers might impose the 
request that their suppliers join a particular DLT-based platform. The main question is who 
will cover the cost of implementing and using the technology. In the case of a blockchain, each 
transaction recorded on the ledger brings about certain costs. Either suppliers need to cover 
the costs of using the technology in order to maintain contractual relationships with retailers, 
which might affect their already low-level margins, or it’s likely that retailers might cover this 
cost burden by transferring costs towards end consumers. Thus, it is expected that retailers start 
investigating DLT possibilities first with high-value products where consumers are already 
willing to pay a premium price to obtain quality or to support specific social initiatives (for 
example, fair trade and fair working conditions along the FVCs). 
Further concerns arise once DLT has been implemented into a specific FVC. The complexity 
of interactions between different members of the FVC brings about significant complexities 
regarding the creation of smart contracts, which have to be regularly modified. There is the 
question on data security, ownership and on who has access to the smart contract data. 
Furthermore, smart contracts require precise semantics and, rigorous testing and validation in 
order to avoid possible repeated mistakes that could damage the whole system. As one of the 
main DLT characteristics is immutability, it is not clear what would happen in a juridical case 
when one party in the contract is legally obliged to change contract condition. How could the 
smart contract be rewritten and who would be in charge of doing it, and for which costs? Further, 
a critical issue is how to control that the data collected from the FVC is correct, especially when 
it comes to certification information, as every member of the blockchain can enter the data. 
Due to the immutable nature of storing data on the blockchain, the question of how to deal 
with false data emerges – or even how to deal with national regulations such as ones included 
in the European General Data Protection Regulation that consider the “right to forget”, while 
DLT aims at the right to “never to forget”  (Vota, 2019). This brings increased responsibility to 
users because there are no third-party regulators who would define rules, regulations and check 
whether the inserted data is correct or not. Thus, most of the cases related to DLT application in 
FVCs refer to permissioned distributed ledgers, where strict rules are set before a new member 
gets access to the system. Other members of the DLT-based platform could quickly sanction 
those violating the rules.
All of the previous concerns about implementation and DLT adoption refer to already integrated 
actors of the FVC. Thus, when focusing on production level of the FVC, farmers’  accessibility of 
DLT would be higher compared to farmers that are not integrated in the FVC, as the technology 
is introduced by the downstream members of the FVC (for example, introduction to technology, 
instructions on how to use the application based on DLT technology, technical support, etc.). It 
is important to stress again that none of the FVC actors is dealing with the core DLT technology, 
that is, the digital database that stays on the decentralized network and connects with DLT-
based applications. They are using a DLT-based platform where they can enter required data or |  19  |2. Digital technologies and Food Value Chains
get the overview of already recorded data. From this perspective, FVC actors do not need to have 
in-depth knowledge on how DLT technology works in order to use the application. Usually, 
DLT-based applications are very similar to the common digital accounting systems already in 
use by many FVC actors. 
Overall, as technological development is rapidly progressing, along with increasing number of 
farmers having the access to mobile and Internet connections, DLT as an underling technology 
for many useful applications in FVC has a great disruptive potential to change existing agri-
food system.
2�3 Artificial intelligence (AI) 
Following the definition provided by the OECD (2016), AI is defined as an ability of machines 
and systems to acquire and apply knowledge to carry out “intelligent behaviour”. Only certain 
aspects of AI find their application in agriculture, such as machine learning (ML) algorithms 
(including deep learning, supervised and unsupervised learning), image and machine vision, 
and robotics. 
The main application of AI is to provide predictions based on data from machine or human-
based inputs. From the economic perspective, AI-based models help the decision-making 
processes, and thus either contribute to cost reduction of the prediction or improve prediction 
accuracy for the same cost (OECD, 2019b). With the rapid development of ML models, mainly 
supported by the emergence of big data, AI-based predictions became easily accessible and 
more affordable. Highly accurate predictions contribute to better decision-making processes by 
reducing uncertainty. In the agriculture and food industry, uncertainty is one of the main factors 
that have an impact on the economic performance of the producers and companies. Higher 
uncertainty leads to higher risk, and thus to higher costs.
Predictive analytics based on image recognition, big data and ML models, together with different 
kinds of robots, are the most typical use cases of AI in agriculture. High-resolution photos from 
satellites are collected and processed, and real-time results are presented to decision-makers in 
the form of predictive analytics (Box 5). Furthermore, modern agricultural machinery is equipped 
with high-tech equipment able to “harvest”  tremendous amounts of data that’s transferred 
in real-time to farmers’  computers for further processing. Application of robots in agriculture 
already has a long history – milking robots, for example, are already widely accepted in the dairy 
sector around the world. Together with the advancement of technology (for example, sensors, 
digital cameras and ML algorithms), the new generation of robots is being created to substitute 
highly demanded skilled labour, especially during the harvest periods.|  20  |
Digital technology and agricultural marketsBox 5  AI in crop monitoring (predictive analytics)
Company:  RESSON (Canada) was established in 2013 to empower growers with digital tools enabling the use of their field data to make 
better-informed decisions and improve efficiency.
Core challenge:  Farmers are not efficient in using data provided by their farms to make timely decisions and secure long-term profitability. 
Commonly, farmers spend significant amounts of time driving around their property in order to identify possible problem areas. Once detected, 
problematic crops are usually sprayed with an amount that could cause severe environmental damages and that has high costs (the same is 
true for the usage of fertilisers).  
A particular focus in agriculture: All crops.
Solution:  A predictive-analytics solution that combines data collected from multiple sources (for example, satellite, drones, close-proximity 
cameras and in-field sensors) with AI and cloud computing. This technology enables farmers to continuously monitor, analyse and predict crop 
health issues before humans are capable of identifying them visually.

Nevertheless, these “modern”  robots are still in an infancy phase and it will probably take several 
years until they become widely adopted as standard in the agricultural sector. Most of the existing 
prototypes are currently used for high-value fresh products such as fruits and vegetables, whose 
harvest is highly labour-intensive (Box 6).  
Besides improving the efficiency of farmers, AI is also a useful tool to improve access to capital 
and financial services, especially in low-income countries. According to estimations of Dalberg 
Global Development Advisors, City Group and Skoll Foundations (2012), the estimated demand 
of small farmers for financing is about USD 450 billion, while the total amount of available 
financing is only about USD 9 billion, that is less than 3 percent of the demand. This enormous 
gap is mainly related to the risk that banks and other financial institutions are faced with when 
lending money to small farmers in low-income countries (for example, a lack of reliable data for 
the financial evaluation of the applicants and a high dependency of farmers’  income on climate 
conditions).|  21  |2. Digital technologies and Food Value Chains
Box 6  Robotics in agriculture
Company:  Harvest CROO Robotics (the United States of America) was established in 2013 to revolutionize the agriculture industry with 
automation. 
Core challenge:  The core problem is a shift of global societal demographics accompanied by immigration, which causes significant 
shortages of labour, especially during the harvest seasons. In addition, the population is growing as people demand more food. Thus, 
CROO Robotics aims at closing the gap between shortages of labour and increasing food demand by developing “high-tack” solutions 
for automatization in agriculture. 
A particular focus in agriculture: Strawberry harvesting (highly labour-intensive and physically difficult).   
Solution:  “Conservation of Motion” robotics that optimize tasks performed by a strawberry harvester. The fully automated harvester can 
substitute work of 30 strawberry pickers, with the potential to harvest up to 3.2 hectares per day. The main advantage of the automated 
harvester is that it uses many robotic hands to perform tasks, such as leaf gathering needed for visual inspection of strawberries; picking 
only ripe, good-quality strawberries; and directly packing strawberries for further transportation and storage.

One AI-based solution is when traditional data on agricultural production and yields are 
combined with satellite data, and then, based on the ML models, predictions of the default 
risk are made. This new credit-scoring method results in lower labour costs compared to the 
traditional method, as there is no need for financial institution representatives to physically 
inspect the farms before the credit evaluation. Furthermore, the new microfinance-AI-based 
model reduces the investment risk for financial institutions due to the spread of individual risk 
to a large number of farmers.
The new AI-based scoring method is already used by some of the typical financing institutions 
(van der Straten, 2018). It has allowed “non-typical”  financing institutions to enter the market 
by providing credit to farmers alongside with additional services (for example, input supply or 
extension services, see Box 7).|  22  |
Digital technology and agricultural marketsBox 7 Artificial intelligence (AI) based financial inclusion of  
small farmers
Company:  Harvesting Inc. (the United States of America) was initiated in 2015 to bring speed, accuracy and transparency in agriculture 
in order to enable financial inclusion for farmers around the world.
Core challenge:  Lack of traditional data – that is usually out of the reach of financial institutions – to help to create a robust risk scoring 
system in agriculture. Digital transformation of the agricultural sector sparks the need for combining agricultural practices with technology 
and regulatory requirements in the financial sector. This requires a combination of skills that is nowadays mainly available through agri-tech 
companies and not so much through traditional financing institutions.      
Particular focus:  Small farmers.   
Solution:  Agriculture Intelligence Engine, a digital platform that combines remote sensing satellites, agriculture, AI and financial tools 
to drive the financial inclusion of small farmers. Combination of remote sensing data and traditional data collected from agriculture (for 
example, production quantities and yields) are used for developing an innovative credit scoring system for farmer financing that: 1) 
increases approval rates, and thus access to credit; and 2) decreases default rates. Furthermore, continuous monitoring of farmlands 
provides an early warning system for repayment risk.

2�4 Additive Manufacturing Technology (3D printing)
Additive manufacturing technology – hereafter 3D printing – is believed to bring a new revolution 
to many industries. 3D printing is not a new technology; it dates back to the 1980s when 3D 
printing technology emerged and was used for rapid prototyping. Nevertheless, at that time, the 
technology was too expensive and not widely used. As the technology has significantly improved 
and its prices11 have dropped considerably, 3D printing has found broader application in many 
industries since the year 2009, when an increased number of non-plastic printing materials 
sprung up.
Nowadays, 3D printing has many applications in different industries: aerospace, consumer 
electronics, medical, entertainment, industrial, consumer products, the automobile industry, and 
many more. Materials used for printing range from plastics (the largest market segment in 3D 
printing (Beyer, 2014)), biomaterials, metals, and ceramics.  
The primary application of 3D printing in agriculture, at this stage of technological development, 
is creating spare parts for agricultural machinery (Box 8). Usage of the 3D printing concept 
for food production is still far from reality. Nevertheless, several companies are running pilot 
projects involving printing food components into different shapes (see Box 9). Most of the 
printed food items are end-consumer products at this stage of the technological developments. 
11  The emergence of the RepRap replication method allows for free development and replication of 3D printers. |  23  |2. Digital technologies and Food Value Chains
Technology is still lacking the possibility to print ready-to-eat products, especially those that 
have to be cooked. 
From an economic perspective, printing costs per unit and the number of units printed per 
minute/hour are two key components that are crucial for the broader adoption of 3D technology. 
At the early stage of 3D printing, it was essential to produce prototypes of products where 
the time component was not that important. It would take several hours or days for some 
industrial components to be printed, and still, the costs per unit were much lower compared 
to the traditional way, that would be to invest in the whole production line before testing the 
final product. Nowadays, as the technology is radically improving and 3D printing is being used 
beyond just prototyping, both costs and speed are gaining importance. 3D printing devices are 
becoming cheaper, and some of the 3D printer producing companies claim that their devices 
could achieve a printing speed that is 25 to 100 percent faster than traditional printers.
3D printing is estimated to have a significant impact on international trade (Arvis et al., 2017), as 
technology allows for automated production on site, eliminating the need for unskilled labour 
from other countries. On the other hand, there is the essential question of the environmental 
sustainability implications of 3D printing. According to an OECD (2017) study, it would be 
necessary to aim towards sustainability of both the materials used for printing and of 3D printers.
It is expected that 3D printing will have more of an impact on food supply chains’  logistics than 
agricultural production. Although not necessarily in a conventional way, agricultural products 
still have to be produced, and then transformed into “food cartridges”  that are delivered to retail 
shops or directly to consumers. The advantage of using “food cartridges”  would be to eliminate 
the perishability of certain products and food waste, as cartridges would be able to preserve the 
quality of ingredients for many years (De Clercq et al., 2018). Thus, one of the FVC sectors that 
will sustain significant transformation is likely to be the processing industry.
Box 8 Additive manufacturing technology (3D printing) and  
agricultural machinery
Company:  AGCO (United States of America) was established in 1990 to help farmers become more productive and profitable. The company 
is a global leader in design, manufacture and distribution of agricultural solutions.
Core challenge:  To develop prototypes of new tools and spare parts. The traditional prototyping procedure took up to five weeks for a third 
party to design the component, followed with an additional two weeks of research by the company.
A particular focus in the food industry: Agricultural tools and machinery.
Solution:  Usage of 3D printers to develop prototypes of new agricultural tools and machinery. The 3D printing solution allows for creating a 
prototype of the product and up to five tests within a five-year period that was previously needed for product design alone. New technology 
enables faster implementation of ideas into real use-cases.

This section provides an overview of the necessary preconditions for digital technology adoption 
and the current state of technological accessibility. Furthermore, assuming that small farmers 
have already adopted some of the available digital tools and technologies, the inclusion of small 
farmers into GVC is also discussed.
3�1 Accessibility of digital technologies
Apart from the tremendous potential of the previously presented digital tools and technologies, 
there are many critical issues when it comes to their accessibility and adoption. The use of 
digital technologies has the potential to reduce both fixed and transaction costs and eliminate 
information asymmetries - the three important conditions for enabling the inclusion of small 
farmers into FVCs. However, certain preconditions have to be met in order to utilize the full 
potential of available digital technologies. 
First, access to information communication technology (ICT) services has to be spread across 
different regions. According to GSMA (2018a), mobile phone network coverage significantly 
increased in recent years, with about 66 percent of the world’s population reported as mobile 
phone users and about 43 percent as mobile Internet users. Nevertheless, most of the people 
that do not have access to mobile phone networks live in rural areas (approximately 1.2 
billion people) (GSMA, 2018b). Furthermore, the quality of the mobile network and Internet 
connection has to be sufficient to allow for stable and constant connections between farmers 
and technology providers. For example, if we consider that a small farmer has access to a digital 
platform offering e-commerce services, there are several critical issues connected to unreliable 
mobile or Internet connection. Any delay in receiving information due to loss of Internet or 
mobile connection could result in additional costs. Farmers might lose buyers that could quickly 
reach their competitors, and they might even be considered unreliable and excluded from the 
platform. The same is true for a technology provider. If a platform’s accessibility is constantly |  28  |
Digital technology and agricultural marketsquestionable, buyers might be afraid of spending their money on that platform, which would 
ultimately affect the platform’s financial state.    
Second, even if the first precondition is fulfilled, and ICT infrastructure is available in rural areas, it 
doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s accessible. Small farmers have to have sufficient financial means 
to pay for mobile or Internet access. Furthermore, certain technology providers might request 
an access fee from farmers in order to use certain technologies (such as an access fee for digital 
platforms offering AI-based crop monitoring service, see box 5). Nevertheless, if the potential 
benefits of participating in the platform outweigh the cost of using the platform, the incentives 
of farmers to participate and use available technology will significantly increase. However, 
emerging business models aim at reducing, or completely eliminating, entry costs for farmers, 
enabling them to use high technology-based services (for example, AI and blockchain). Overall, 
inequality in access to technologies leads to inequality in opportunities to be included in FVCs.
Third, farmers have to have a minimum level of both general literacy (to know how to read and 
write) and digital literacy (to open a SMS message or a certain application) in order use the 
provided digital solutions. Nevertheless, digital tools are becoming user friendly to the extent 
that even if someone does not know how to read and write, they still can use certain digital tools 
by using icons, or audio-video messages, instead of letters.
Fourth, land tenure security is an important precondition for small farmers to capitalize on 
adopting certain innovation (World Bank, 2019b). Many small farmers around the world do not 
have formal title to their land or, due to unstable political conditions, could easily lose their rights. 
Fifth, the lack of information on available technologies together with a lack of the skills necessary 
to use these new technologies are also among the crucial obstacles to farmer technology 
adoption - and thus the opportunity to be included in FVCs. Farmers need to be informed that 
certain technologies exist and see themselves as an example of someone who can use particular 
technologies to resolve some of their problems. Formal education of farmers is one of the key 
components in technology adoption. As recognized in many studies, more educated farmers 
tend to adopt new technologies earlier (World Bank, 2019b; Foster and Rosenzweig, 2010). Once 
certain digital solutions are recognized as feasible options for farmers, gaining the necessary 
skills to use the technology is necessary and important. New digital technologies are becoming 
more skill intensive and require more managing activities by the side of farmers (Gollin et al., 
2005). Uninformed and unskilled farmers will not be able to utilize digital technologies, and 
thus they’ll have a higher chance of being excluded from the FVCs.
Finally, technology providers themselves also need to understand the local issues faced by 
farmers and create easy-to-use solutions. Digital products based on “one solution fits all”  
principle usually fail when it comes to adoption by farmers. Furthermore, according to Aker et al. 
(2016), digital products and services should be adjusted to local ICT conditions, paying attention 
to the gender digital divide, and most importantly, they should be provided by a trusted source. 
In many developing countries, these conditions are very difficult to achieve as many technology 
providers try to scale up their business model and thus tend to provide general products.       
In most of the cases where these preconditions are fulfilled, small farmers using certain 
digital tools, such as digital platforms, are not even aware of the underling digital technology 
(for example, DLT or AI). The most important accessibility criteria, from the end-users point 
of view, is that a certain digital tool (based on certain digital technology) is: a) Perceivable – 
the user can visually identify the content; b) Operable – the user can easily use the provided 
controls to navigate through provided interface; c) Understandable – the provided interface is |  29  |3. Accessibility of digital technologies and inclusion of small farmers into global value chains (GVCs)
consistent in presentation and format; and d) Robust – the provided tool should be compatible 
with different digital technologies. Thus, technology providers are responsible to maintain the 
technology and provide easy to use applications to their clients. In most of the cases, technology 
providers approach small farmers with specific digital solutions to their problems, providing 
the instructions to farmers on how to use their digital tools and how to benefit from them. As 
technology providers need a critical mass of users to maintain their business model, most of 
them provide services with no fee to farmers. In this way, a complex technology such as DLT and 
AI are almost freely available to small farmers, however, they still need to pay for mobile and/or 
Internet access.   
When looking from the broader perspective, not strictly focused on small farmers, early adopters 
of new technologies are usually farmers that could be classified as large. These farmers usually 
have secured land tenure, access to finance, are already receiving support from extension service 
providers, and are willing to take risk (Feder et al., 1985). As an example, implementation of digital 
technologies in the Russian Federation and Ukraine is almost exclusively done by large agro-industrial 
holdings (sometimes called agroholdings) (Baryshnikova et al., 2019). Some of the top Ukrainian  
agro-industrial holdings are investing up to USD 7 per hectare (for example, Karnel agro-
industrial holding invested about USD 2.7 million in digitalization, covering 540 thousand 
hectares of land) (LaScalA, 2019). These large agricultural producers are able to access capital 
needed for further infrastructural investments compared to other farm types – such as family 
farms – that dominate agricultural markets in the Russian Federation and Ukraine.
3�2 Inclusion of small farmers into global value chains (GVCs)
Once all preconditions for technological accessibility and adoption are fulfilled, small farmers 
have an opportunity to get involved into FVCs. As already mentioned in the previous section, 
available digital tools and technologies provide a wide range of possibilities to FVC actors, and 
especially small farmers, to enhance productivity, profitability and performance. Furthermore, 
certain tools and technologies could help promote the participation of small farmers in 
international trade through GVCs. 
It is estimated that about 80 percent of global trade is conducted through GVCs (UNCTAD, 
2013). Most of the parties directly involved in GVC trade are large companies, although they 
represent a small percent of total companies in the global economy; small and medium-sized 
enterprises (SMEs) continue to dominate. SMEs are mostly indirectly involved in GVCs, as they 
are often suppliers for those enterprises that are export oriented (WTO, 2019). Nevertheless, 
WTO (2016) findings indicate that digital technologies greatly enable SMEs in both export and 
import activities, whereby export costs could be reduced by up to 82 percent together with 
reductions of up to 59 percent in the operating costs associated with dealing with foreign markets 
(AMTC, 2018). Within the agriculture and food industry, the situation is similar: large companies 
are mainly involved in international trade. Most of the small farmers - including SMEs in the 
food industry - are mainly focused on local markets and DVCs.
Important preconditions for supporting small farmers inclusion into GVCs are access to 
information related to regulation and standards in different countries, and access to finance. Digital 
platforms are used in many countries to provide valuable information on a range of regulations 
and standards (such as sanitary and phytosanitary measures) that exporters should consider 
when engaging in international trade. In combining digital platforms with blockchain technology, 
there is a potential in achieving almost paperless trade. E-certificates could easily be shared 
between the authorities even before the shipment physically reaches the border, significantly |  30  |
Digital technology and agricultural marketsreducing the time for clearance at the border (Jouanjean, 2019). Knowing the strict rules of other 
actors within the GVC is of great importance, especially as inclusion in a certain GVC might be 
conditioned by the use of a certain technology. In an example provided by the World Bank (2019a), 
certain retailers might request that suppliers introduce traceability systems, such as blockchain 
technology, in order to increase response times in case of a foodborne disease. Such preconditions 
for being included in the GVC might be a crucial obstacle for farmers who do not have sufficient 
financial means to implement this technology. Thus, access to finance should be adjusted to 
small-farmers’  needs to enable inclusion in international trade and GVCs. Digital technologies 
provide practical solutions, especially for small farmers and SMEs in developing countries that do 
not have access to traditional financial tools (for example, credit). Blockchain technology might 
serve as a convenient tool for using the recorded data as proof of being credit worthy without 
a need for possessing the collateral (see section 2.2). Furthermore, blockchain also enables  
peer-to-peer payments that exclude the banking system from transactions, thus eliminating the 
need for traditional financial instruments.    
Digital technologies offer many opportunities for small farmers to get engaged in GVCs and 
improve their financial condition. For example, blockchain has a great potential in transforming 
GVCs by providing transparency of supply chain actors and their practices, improve cost 
efficiency, radically reduce fraudulent actions, provide near real-time data traceability, overcome 
trade financing problems, and provide new types of contractual relations between GVC actors. 
Being a member of a GVC that uses blockchain technology allows for a business model that does 
not require strong vertical integration of the value chain. As all of the actions within the chain are 
recorded without a possibility of changes being made, incentives for fraudulent action from the 
members are almost eliminated, allowing for more flexible contractual relations within the chain 
(that is, there is no need for strict vertical integration of the GVC). This contractual flexibility, 
further supported through the usage of digital platforms, allows farmers to be members of many 
GVCs at the same time (as long as they can fulfil their obligations). 
Blockchain technology also has great potential to empower fairer distribution of added value 
along the GVCs, especially in the first mile of the supply chain (namely, small farmers). There 
are many pilot projects that use blockchain technology to provide transparent systems of added 
value distribution along the GVC (see Box 10). Equitable prices for farmers could be achieved 
by blockchain’s traceability feature. Consumers could trace the origin of a certain product, get 
quickly informed about the working conditions of the farmers, and be sure that farmers received 
an ethical price for their products. 
Besides many benefits of using digital technologies to promote GVC participation, the same 
technologies might actually hinder the need for GVCs, and thus enable conditions for further 
development of short (local) DVCs. With the same traceability feature of the blockchain, 
consumers could be ensured that certain products originate from their region, and be informed 
of different environmental and social aspects of food production. Thus, consumer behaviour, 
empowered by digital technologies, might cause reshoring initiatives (Ferrantino and Koten, 
2019). Overall, it remains unclear as to how digital technologies may affect the very development 
of GVCs in the future.|  31  |3. Accessibility of digital technologies and inclusion of small farmers into global value chains (GVCs)
Box 10 Blockchain for fairer global value chains (GVCs)
Company:  Moyee Coffee (Ireland), bext360 (United States of America) and FairChain Foundation (The Netherlands). A pilot coffee 
project Moyee Coffee started in 2017 to prove that the coffee food value chain (FVC) could be honest and fair. 
Core challenge:  Coffee production and processing is a complex process that involves a large number of intermediate actors within the 
GVC. It is estimated that coffee producers account for only 2 percent of the added value of every cup of coffee sold to the customers in 
the coffee shops. Furthermore, many of the coffee certification schemes do not provide sufficient transparency demanded by consumers. 
Moyee Coffee is grown in Ethiopia (the Limu and Jimma regions) by farmers owning about one hectare 
of plot. The average production of 200 coffee shrubs would secure an annual income of about  
USD 400.
A particular focus in agriculture: Coffee 
Solution:  Moyee Coffee blockchain-based social business model supplying Ethiopian roasted specialty coffee to consumers in Ireland. 
The key innovation refers to usage of cryptotokens to achieve transparency along the chain. At the point of coffee collection a special 
token is created on a blockchain platform directly presenting the value of the commodity. As commodity goes along the chain, additional 
tokens are created at each stage. Thus, the whole process of added value is transparent. Usage of tokens indicates possibilities for 
significant transaction cost reduction along the entire GVC. Furthermore, the Moyee Coffee project pays a 20 percent FairChain 
premium to farmers who commit to stay organic and attend specialized trainings.

New market structures and enhancement of public services|  35  | |  35  |4 New market structures and enhancement of public services 
This section provides a discussion on how previously described digital tools and technologies 
enable significant changes in agricultural and food markets from two different perspectives. 
The discussion starts from the digital technology providers and the downstream sector of FVCs 
to identify emerging new market structures. Also, some thoughts are provided on how digital 
technologies contribute to a better provision of public goods and services related to agriculture.  
4�1 Incentivizing new market structures
The classic economic concept indicates that digital technologies reduce the transaction costs of 
accessing information. If there are information asymmetries present, transaction costs will be so 
high that certain interactions will not take place. For example, a small farmer may not be able to 
obtain credit from a financial institution that does not have enough data to evaluate the credit 
status of the applicant (Deichmann et al., 2016). 
Once an innovative digital technology is accepted and widely used in the market, transaction 
costs significantly drop compared to the period before the innovation. An example could be the 
acceptance of Internet and mobile phones to receive information. Given that farmers have access 
to mobile phones or Internet, it has become very easy for them to receive different information 
relevant to their farming decisions. Nowadays, having a mobile phone might be sufficient for 
obtaining access to different financial services - even without a formal bank account or providing 
certain collateral (see Box 4, section 2).  
Finally, there are emerging business models, based on different digital technologies that 
essentially lead towards almost zero transaction costs. The best example would be digital 
platforms with e-commerce services. After the initial high costs of building a platform and the 
first digital product (for example, providing a digital record of farmers’  activities to determine 
their credit score, see Box 7, section 2), the costs for replicating the product significantly drops 
with higher numbers of users of the service. In other words, products could be offered instantly 
with very low or almost zero marginal costs. This business model refers to the new emerging 
digital economy in which new market structures are created based on economies of scale.  
The new emerging digital economy is based on two features: potential to scale and the importance 
of intangible capital. The potential to scale has already been explained through the example of 
digital platforms. The importance of intangible capital is significantly growing together with 
technological development. Intangible capital refers to a business idea, branding, software, 
licenses and much more. According to Haskel and Westlake (2017), investments in the intangible 
exceed investments in the tangible, as is the case in Finland, the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland, the United States of America and Sweden. Furthermore, Haskel 
and Westlake argue that there are four economic properties of intangible assets: “scalability”, 
“sunkenness”, “spillovers”, and “synergies”, which allow for the rise of large digital companies, 
in addition to leading to more mergers and acquisitions, and a higher concentration in the 
industry.  
The main characteristics of the digital economy are present in the agriculture and food industry |  36  |
Digital technology and agricultural marketsas well. Large agri-food companies are also the owners of large digital platforms12 that collect 
enormous amount of data from farmers. The need for “data harvesting”  is significantly increasing, 
as sophisticated ML models need big data in order to provide accurate predictions. It is becoming 
common for large input and machinery companies specifically to acquire or partner with 
different software companies that are usually developing digital technologies for farmers. As an 
example provided by Mooney (2018), to improve its own services, Monsanto - one of the largest 
agricultural companies worldwide that recently merged with Bayer - acquired two software 
companies (Precision Planting and The Climate Corporation); a company providing a service 
for planting prescriptions (FieldScripts); and two companies that developed web applications 
for climate and fertilizer use (Climate Basic and Climate Pro). Further on, Mooney indicates that 
large companies tend to gain control over big data coming from agriculture because it helps 
them to better understand the general food system, and thus easily eliminate competition and 
increase profit. 
The concentration of companies is visible in almost all sectors of the agricultural production and 
food industry. For example Bayer–Monsanto (Germany) and Corteva Agriscience (the United 
States of America) control 54 percent of the seed market; Bayer–Monsanto and ChemCina–
Syngenta control 46 percent of the agrochemical market, Nutrien (Canada) and Yara (Norway) 
have a dominant position on the fertilizer market, and John Deere (the United States of America), 
Kubota (Japan), and CNH Industrial (the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 
and the Netherlands) have the highest shares in the agricultural machinery sector (Mooney, 
2018). It is expected that concentration will continue in the coming years - and especially in 
the agricultural machinery sector as new digital technologies implemented in agricultural 
machinery are able to collect real on-farm data and send it to whomever is in charge. Thus, if 
not seriously monitored by government regulations, a continuation of centralization processes 
in the agriculture and food industry might lead towards duopolies or even monopolies in who 
is controlling food production, processing and distribution. 
12  Note that these platforms are not e-commerce based, as referred to in the rest of the paper. These platforms are usually providing farm management and agronomic services for farmers. |  37  |4. New market structures and enhancement of public services
4�2 Provide better public services in agriculture
“Pure”  public goods are products or services that, when provided to one individual person or 
a company, still remain available to others at no additional expenses. The two most important 
components of a public good are non-rivalry and non-exclusion (Samuelson, 1954). Non-rivalry 
refers to the simultaneous consumption of the product or usage of the service, while non-
exclusion refers to the fact that a person or a company can’t be excluded for consuming a public 
good. If one of these two components is not achieved, then it refers to an imperfect or ineffective 
public good (that is, a “pure”  private good). 
According to economic theory, markets are functioning well and add to social welfare in cases 
where supplied products or services are rival and excludable in nature (Gans et al., 2012). In 
other words, someone cannot use a product or service unless she or he pays for it, and using it 
prohibits others from gaining the same benefit. Thus, the theory states that markets fail when 
both non-rivalry and non-exclusion exist at the same time, when social welfare is sub-optimal. 
In this situation, as companies or individuals fail to provide products or services needed by 
society, governments need to react by providing public goods, as the benefits of governmental 
action exceed cost (Griffith et al., 2014). 
When considering agriculture, all of the products produced are actually non-public goods 
provided by the private sector. The non-rivalry condition is not met since consumption of a 
certain product depends on the level of demand; increased demand leads to a reduction in 
available amounts of the product. Furthermore, many consumers are excluded from consumption 
of certain products as farmers are “free”  to set the price of their products (greatly depending on 
the market conditions). 
Nevertheless, there are public goods directly related to agriculture, such as provision of public 
services through Research and Development (R&D) and extension services. Both. of these 
public goods relate directly to digital technology adoption. In fact, digital technology could itself 
be used by governments to provide more efficient public services and targeted policies that 
ensure no one is left behind when it comes to accessibility and adoption of new technologies in 
agriculture and FVCs. Such an approach could ultimately prevent a digital divide13. 
The public sector has traditionally been the engine of R&D in agriculture, mainly based on open 
access to intellectual property, that is, it is an impure global public good as defined by Dalrymple 
(2004) (Piesse and Thirtle, 2010). Nevertheless, this trend was dominant until the end of 1990s. 
The latest available figures from 2011 indicate that public R&D accounts for 55 percent of the 
global USD 69 billion spent on R&D (Pardey et al., 2016). The trend from recent years indicates 
a significant slowdown of public spending on R&D, especially in high-income countries. On 
the other hand, private investments in R&D are recording rapid growth. This trend could be 
directly associated with constraints in fiscal policies of many countries, advancements in genetic 
engineering, technological innovations (digitalization and robotics) and increased marketization 
of supply chains (Jaruzelski et al., 2017). Similar to developments related to concentration of 
primary data in agriculture (see subsection 4.1), private sector investments into agricultural 
R&D are dominated by large international seed, chemical and biotechnological companies such 
as BASF, Bayer (Monsanto), Syngenta and others. This trend might potentially lead towards 
oligopolistic competition in agricultural innovations (Piesse and Thirtle, 2010).
13  The term digital divide is defined by the OECD (2001, p. 5) as the: “…gap between individuals, households, businesses and geographic areas at different socio-economic levels with 
regard both to their opportunities to access information and communication technologies (ICTs) and to their use of the Internet for a wide variety of activities”.|  38  |
Digital technology and agricultural marketsPublic-sector R&D is particularly important for low-income countries where demand for 
increased productivity in agriculture is high. If innovations are not easily accessible to farmers, 
general agricultural productivity will be reduced and, in particular, low-income countries that 
rely heavily on the agricultural sector will suffer. Thus, it is of great importance that R&D is 
further supported especially in low-income countries. As there might be many fiscal constraints 
from the public sector, governments could provide the incentives for public-private partnership 
to leverage public investments in R&D related to agricultural innovations. Public-private 
partnership in R&D could contribute to reducing a gap between innovation being found and the 
time needed for it to be implemented and widely adopted (adoption of agricultural innovations 
might take 15 to 25 years) (Moreddu, 2016). 
One of the direct consequences of low investments in public R&D is the quality of public extension 
services. In theory, extension services provided could be of great help, especially for getting small 
farmers familiar with available digital technologies through knowledge-transfer activities (for 
example, visiting other farms that are already using certain technologies, conducting on-field 
tests, providing exert presentations, and many more), ultimately leading towards better digital 
literacy. Nevertheless, there are many factors that cause inefficient public extension services in 
practice. According to Feder et al. (2001), there are eight important factors: scale and complexity 
of services; policy environment; weak interaction between knowledge generation systems and 
extension providers; difficulties in tracing extension impact; accountability of service providers; 
weak political support; different knowledge transfer difficulties; and finally, fiscal unsustainability 
of many countries.
The emergence of sophisticated technologies such as AI, big data analytics, and cloud computing 
have resulted in new ways of delivering extension services. As it becomes possible to tailor 
services to a specific field and farmer, the incentives of farmers to pay for such services also 
increase – thus leading towards a transition from publicly offered, low-efficient and out-dated 
services towards highly efficient private for-profit services. These newly emerging services offered 
by the private for-profit sector are a type of quasi-public good as they are non-rival in nature 
(they can be used simultaneously) but are excludable, (they can only be used by those who pay 
for the service). It is important to note that the emergence of disruptive digital technologies 
brought about a concept of data-driven business models in services related to agriculture. As 
mentioned in Section 2, the business model of some digital platforms does not require users 
to pay for using their services. Nevertheless, the platform might use sophisticated technology 
to collect users’  data, based on their behaviour while using the platform (for example, users 
may provide personal data on production, quantity of inputs used and their costs, interest in 
particular services, and so on), which is then sold to third parties. In this business model, and 
assuming a lack of strict data-privacy regulations, services offered to platform users are both 
non-rival and non-exclusive (if assuming that technology is accessible and other preconditions 
are fulfilled, see section 3).   
Besides supporting development of digital technologies, governments could also use some of 
the digital solutions to provide more efficient public services, especially in agriculture. There 
are many examples where digital technologies help reduce the time needed to apply for the 
agricultural services (for example, in Estonia, Kärner (2017)), or reaching a higher number of 
beneficiaries for lower costs (for example, Nigeria, see Box 11). Furthermore, the usage of AI 
– ML models based on big data – to analyse large amounts of data from different IoT devices 
could help governments create automated early warning systems. Providing critical information 
on time significantly reduces the risk of farmers not taking certain measures, and thus reducing 
possible negative consequences. Overall, there is great potential for governments to use digital |  39  |4. New market structures and enhancement of public services
technologies and improve the way the public sector operates. As there is a rapid development of 
digital technologies, it might not be cost-effective for governments to constantly adjust to new 
technological developments. Therefore, governments should focus on better collaboration with 
the private sector to embrace the latest technology and know-how.
Box 11 Digital technologies and public services in agriculture
Focus country:  Nigeria
Public service:  Growth enhancement support scheme aiming to lift 20 million poor farmers out of subsistence and into self-sufficiency. 
Core challenge:  The federal Government of Nigeria created a subsidy programme that showed a low effect since only 11 percent of the 
USD 200 million reached farmers. For example, most of the inputs provided to farmers through the subsidy programme, were subsequently 
sold by them on the black market. This situation greatly affected local businesses (input suppliers) as the prices offered by farmers were below 
the market prices. 
Solution:  e-Wallet, and electronic distribution channel that provides efficient and transparent systems for the purchase and distribution of 
agricultural inputs. Registered users of the subsidy programme would receive eWallet vouchers that they could redeem for agricultural inputs 
directly from agro-dealers for half of the costs. The second half of the costs was covered by the federal government. 
Effects:  According to Cellulant, the e-Wallet technology provider, 90 percent of farm inputs provided by the scheme were used by the 
selected farmers. As a result, the average annual income of these farmers transitioned from USD 700 to USD 1 800. Furthermore, it is 
recorded that the government managed to reach 4.3 million farmers with about USD 96 million in 2013, compared to reaching about 700 
000 with USD 180 million prior to the e-Wallet implementation.

Conclusions and policy implications|  43  | |  43  |5 Conclusions and policy implications 
5�1 Summary discussion and conclusions 
Disruptive digital technologies have a great potential to enable further development of the 
agricultural sector, significantly reshape GVCs, and greatly contribute towards more productive, 
resilient and transparent food systems. As most of the technologies with the highest potential 
to revolutionize the agriculture and food industry are in their infancy phase of development 
(such as, blockchain, AI and 3D printing), it is still too early to access their true impact. Wide 
technology acceptance greatly depends on all involved actors, as governments have to enable 
adequate environments for innovations and further technological development. Providers of 
the technologies have to understand and match market needs, while technology users have to 
understand and adopt different technologies. 
Digital technologies are not the panacea for all challenges facing the agriculture and food 
industry. Nevertheless, the discussion provided in this paper indicates that digital technologies 
could significantly reduce transaction costs – and especially resolve the information asymmetry 
problem. Furthermore, this discussion has revealed that there are great benefits of digital 
technologies, particularly for small farmers, FVCs (their business models), technology providers 
(agricultural companies providing digital tools for farmers), and governments. 
Mobile phones, the Internet and especially digital platforms offering e-commerce services are 
among the most important enablers of small farmers getting involved with formal economies. 
With very low costs for using the technologies, small farmers are able to get direct access to 
market information and become involved with trading activities. Digital platforms – supported 
with AI and blockchain technologies – play a key role when it comes to small farmers’  abilities 
to increase the efficiency of production (see Box 5) and get involved with FVCs (see Box 1). 
Furthermore, the combination of different digital technologies helps farmers to overcome 
additional key problems, such as access to finance and insurance services (see Box 4).  
Concerning FVCs in general, digital technologies have a great potential to change the existing 
linear business model. Blockchain technology brought with it the possibility of a decentralized 
tamper-proof data storing system, leading to high levels of security and trust. For FVCs, this 
system has many potential benefits. For example, internal contractual relations within a 
particular FVC do not need to be strict and heavily regulated, since fraudulent actions would 
be easily recognized and sanctioned by other members of the FVC. Thus, there would not be a 
strong need for strict vertical integrations of the FVCs (see Box 3). Also, the possibility of safely 
storing data on a blockchain has great potential in international agricultural trade since all of 
the documents related to trade could be digitalized and simply follow the physical movement 
of goods within a GVC. Ultimately, FVCs might gain more trust from consumers because they 
would be able to provide traceability and provenance of their products (see Box 2). 
Finally, governments can benefit greatly from using digital technologies related to agricultural 
sector activities. More specifically, they could use different ML models to analyse large data sets 
and make better assessments regarding who should be targeted with specific measures and how 
much financing should be allocated. Furthermore, digital technologies help with more efficient 
allocation of funds, for example, subsidies (see Box 10), and better monitoring of the impact. 
Besides having numerous potential benefits, the use of digital technologies also encompasses |  44  |
Digital technology and agricultural marketsmany concerns and risks. Lack of sufficient information, or understanding, of what a particular 
technology might provide as a benefit and the potentially high costs of technology implementation, 
represent some of the greatest obstacles for wider acceptance of various emerging technologies.
Another major concern is data protection. As indicated in this paper, most of the emerging 
technologies greatly rely on large amounts of data collected from technology users. Even if users 
sometimes receive access to a certain technology for “free”, the question is whether it is really 
for free, as users’  data is collected and processed. It’s then either used by technology providers 
to improve the technology or create well-targeted marketing campaigns, and/or is sold to third 
parties. As it’s not always clear who actually owns the data, this problem can be quite complex. 
Once a farmer or an SME is using a digital platform, or is operating on a blockchain, there is 
always a concern of who is governing the technology and which decisions are being made. If a 
particular digital platform suddenly stops operating, users could face high transaction costs as 
they would need to look for a new platform and customers. The same applies to the governance 
of different platforms hosting blockchain technology that rely on communities of programmers. 
The question of what could happen to the data of the blockchain users if the community 
decides to make a major change or stop working on further platform development needs to be 
considered. Governance of the technology is crucial when it comes to scalability issues as well. 
Digital technologies also contribute to the creation of new business models based on economies 
of scale. Besides providing enormous possibilities for businesses to grow – as they produce digital 
products with almost zero product replicability costs – it also leads to a potential danger in the 
market. This is especially the case for large agri-food companies, mainly input and machinery 
providers, who develop their own digital platforms and try to “harvest”  as much data as possible 
in order to control bigger market shares and increase profits. This “hunger”  for data is displayed 
through massive mergers between companies in the agri-food sector leading towards clear 
concentration in certain segments (for example, seed production and agricultural machinery 
sectors). 
5�2 Policy implications
Based on the discussion provided in this paper, the following recommendations refer to both 
policy makers and technology developers. 
Ensure that regulatory bodies obtain the necessary skills  to understand the technical 
characteristics of the digital technologies in order to identify which national legislations have to 
be adjusted to respond to market needs. 
Promote and support investment in ICT networks in remote areas.  As ICT enables digital 
technologies, it is important to provide access to as many individuals as possible to avoid 
digital divides. 
Provide support for education activities in rural areas , especially taking into consideration 
gender aspects. It is important to support education of rural population in order to enable faster 
adoption of innovations in agriculture. 
Provide clear national data protection regulations to ensure digital privacy.  There is a 
need for clear guidance from national governments on data protection rules. Furthermore, to 
ensure compatibility, regulations on data protection should be in line with existing international 
standards. Many developed countries already have strict regulations on data-handling procedures |  45  |5. Conclusions and policy implications
compared to the still loose regulations in place in many developing countries (Rossotto 
et al., 2018). Thus, as digital products might easily reach customers out of national borders, 
it is important to have a common understanding of rules and regulations. Furthermore, it is 
important to revise certain existing rules in order to account for newly emerging technologies 
(for example, blockchain and DLT standards). 
Implement measures to ensure market transparency and access to information.  
Governments might consider implementing obligatory traceability requirements, such as the 
European Union General Food Law (European Union, 2007), because of phytosanitary issues.  
As consumers request more transparency and information about the food they eat, a similar 
initiative could also come from the side of FVCs. Implementing measures in support of market 
transparency and access to market information could significantly improve the participation of 
domestic producers in GVCs. 
Strengthen market competition regulations.  New regulations should particularly refer to 
the emerging business models based on economies of scale, such as digital platforms. It has 
already been shown that digital platforms can easily scale to the level of having market power. 
Furthermore, governments should prevent strong centralization of digital technology providers, 
as this might lead to higher costs of using the technology, and thus potential digital divides. 
Support public–private partnerships to foster R&D and enable wider technology 
acceptance.  Both the public and private sectors could benefit from a joint effort to develop 
new digital solutions through R&D in agriculture. Public–private partnerships using digital 
technologies have already had some positive results in many countries, specifically regarding more 
efficient allocations of government funds (for example, the agricultural subsidy programme in 
Nigeria), improved efficiency of general services provided to society (for example, e-government  
services in Estonia), or numerous examples of private companies providing improved extension 
services for farmers.REFRENCES|  49  | |  49  |References
