Abstract
This paper evaluates opportunities and challenges of the Union Digital Centre (UDC) project, a Bangladeshi
telecentre initiative, based on a Public-Private-People’s Partnership (PPPP) scheme. It investigates how each of
the stakeholders contributes. In the face of many closures, it is a timely contribution. A stakeholder manage-
ment framework focused on telecentres is used to understand stakeholder behaviour and to provide a
hypothesis about the contribution of each to the operation. This study surveyed stakeholders such as entre-
preneurs, central government officials and local government representatives. The roles of stakeholders are
discussed and opportunities are identified for external support from government bodies to support the
operation of UDCs. The potential demands and benefits of a massive client base are also examined. Application
of a structural equation model highlights that current progress hinges more on external support and people’s
participation than on entrepreneurial investment. The dependency on philanthropic support, combined with
problems in stakeholder engagement, poses challenges to entrepreneurship development, a feature necessary
for sustainability. To engage them, effective interplay of relevant stakeholders is required.

Introduction
Information and Communication Technology (ICT)-
led public administration reform, termed
e-government, has been adopted by many developing
countries to enable development and good govern-
ance (Bhatnagar, 2004; Madon, 2009). However,
faced with economic and social hurdles, governments
often adopt affordable and opportunistic means to
connect with otherwise unconnected citizens. The tel-
ecentre concept is a popular strategy for reaching
underserved groups with the benefits of ICT in shared
access points, including Internet and services to lever-
age economic development and enhanced quality of
life (Hanna, 2010; Proenza, 2001). However, such a
project also involves substantial logistic and financial
cost. Partnership with the community represents a
leapfrogging strategy to avoid overwhelming costs
by offering quick-win shared access points (Hanna,2008; Harris, 2007; Proenza, 2001). Known as ‘social
outsourcing’ the partnership involves the government
using infomediaries and other support from the com-
munity (Hanna, 2010). The community can help with
volunteering, awareness, and ownership, all of which
improve the financial and social sustainability of the
telecentre (Roman and Colle, 2002; Shadrach and
Sharma, 2013).
While the public sector initially takes the respon-
sibility for jumpstarting the project by building
and equipping these centres, the private sector should
ultimately own and operate them. Private sector

involvement would convert the telecentre into an
enterprise through investment, competition, and inno-
vation (Hanna, 2008, 2010). Unfortunately, in numer-
ous instances (Jensen, 2007; Kuriyan and Ray, 2009;
Shadrach and Sharma, 2013) the private sector has
performed poorly and the public sector has taken too
long to supply support, thereby limiting engagement.
Nevertheless, there are many instances of sustainable
telecentres overcoming difficulties through effective
collaboration of partners (Information Communica-
tion Technology Agency, 2010; Shadrach, 2012).
This paper examines the factors that help determine
the success or failure of the telecentre concept in
Bangladesh.
Whilst telecentres and the PPP model which under-
pins them have been studied elsewhere (Bailur, 2007;
Mishra and Dwivedi, 2012; Mishra and Mishra,
2013), the Bangladeshi UDC represents a unique sit-
uation as it explicitly involves the community as part
of the PPPP concept. This is important given the
potential demands of such a large number of people
living in one of the most densely populated countries
in the world (Access to Information, 2014; Siddiquee
and Faroqi, 2013). Thus, there is a need to provide an
account of the program and the factors that are likely
to impact its success. The project appears to be suf-
fering from a high drop-out rate of entrepreneurs with
nearly one quarter of centres shut down within three
years. Almost half of all UDCs are entirely without
female entrepreneurs and they only attend regularly in
few centres. This study would appear overdue given
the problems that are anecdotally evident.
This paper identifies relevant stakeholders of the
UDC and analyses their roles, and the constraints and
the challenges that evolve from their interplay. It also
provides recommendations for better involvement of
stakeholders in operations. Reflecting the apparent
inability of entrepreneurs to invest, the need for exter-
nal support, and the importance of the people to the
project, the hypothesis of the study is: the current
progress of UDC hinges more on external support and
people’s participation than on investment of the pri-
vate operator.
Background – theory, history and
structure of the Bangladeshi Union Digital
Centre (UDC) telecentre concept
Telecentres in general as public - private partnerships
The public – private partnership (PPP), in its conven-
tional form, involves the government making anarrangement with capable elements of the private sec-
tor to share risks and returns in financing, designing,
constructing, operating and owning public infrastruc-
ture or services (Hodge, 2004). Essentially, the gov-
ernment eliminates the need to borrow. For private
partners, PPP produces reward for completing proj-
ects on time and within budget, and for operating the
asset with care (Flynn, 2007; Webb and Pulle, 2002).
Governments in some developing countries either
directly engage local entrepreneurs or involve an
intermediary with expertise in harnessing investment
and efficiency from local level operators (Information
Communication Technology Agency, 2010; Shadrach
and Sharma, 2013).There are risks and benefits asso-
ciated with both approaches: Engaging intermediaries
utilises otherwise unavailable experience and trans-
fers some of the risk of failure, but this comes at the
cost of losing some direct input in telecentre opera-
tions (Kuriyan and Ray, 2009; Liyanage, 2009;
Shadrach, 2012).
Government support is somewhat contrary to the
classical notion of entrepreneurship that contains an
assumption of risk and responsibility in designing and
implementing a business strategy (Schumpeter,
1949). However, PPP still has inherent problems from
unclear goals, resource constraints, tension over
power sharing and different motives (Abelson,
2007; Silva and Rodrigures, 2005). If operators are
only acquainted with charitable funding they tend to
neglect financing from their own sources (Liyanage,
2009).Thus, the government has a critical role in cre-
ating an enabling environment through training, con-
sultation, monitoring and reward for entrepreneurial
development (Kuriyan and Ray, 2009; Shadrach
and Sharma, 2013) whilst maintaining a require-
ment for growing financial independence. This is
crucial for financial sustainability since a good
entrepreneur must develop business techniques to
thrive without continual recourse to handouts (Cec-
chini and Scott, 2003).
Continuing financial support from the government
is discouraged for two reasons: shortage of public
funding and inefficiency and unresponsiveness
(Hanna, 2010; Harris, 2007). High subsidization in
developing countries is associated with wastage, for-
cing the government to stop or at least limit funding
(Proenza, 2001). However, emphasis on market
approach or commercial viability risks downplaying
developmental objectives such as bridging the digital
divide. Thus, balance between subsidy and revenue is
critical to achieve sustain ability in all dimensions.2 Information Development XX(X)The ‘social enterprise model’ highlights the need for
balance between economic gains and social targets
(Hanna, 2010; Harris, 2007; Proenza, 2001). To
achieve both of these goals, the government needs
to identify the private operators and give them true
partnership.
In the Indian Gyandoot Panchayat Model, the
Gram orJanpad Panchayat (the smallest unit of local
government) provides the physical space, invests in
equipment and other infrastructure, and purchases and
pays utility bills. This association provides advan-
tages such as proximity to people, confidence in the
system and mass awareness (Naik, 2011). However,
Rahul De (cited in Naik, 2011) warns that giving
management control to these units runs the risk of
middleman capture. Furthermore, local government
units in developing countries are not immune from
illiteracy and governance problems caused by corrup-
tion, nepotism, inefficiency, patron-clientelism and
lack of participation (Crook and Manor, 1998).
Hence, the effectiveness of their involvement in some
of the important components of stakeholders’ man-
agement is debatable (Wellenius, 2003).
History of the Bangladeshi Union Digital Centre
(UDC) telecentre concept
There are several demographic features of Bangla-
desh pertinent to the telecentre concept. Bangladesh
has a population of approximately 160 million people
living in 147,500 square kilometres (World Popula-
tion Review, 2014). More than 60 %of the population
are younger than 29 (Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics,
2010). Among these, 41 %are neither employed, nor
in education or training and at 66 %, the case is even
worse for females (Sarah, 2014). Only 6.3 %of people
have access to the Internet. Telecentres thrive in coun-
tries with more unemployed young people and limited
access to the Internet (Proenza, 2001).
Although the policy steps toward integration of
e-government in Bangladesh span more than a decade
(Faroqi and Siddiquee, 2011), they were originally
restricted to basic computerisation/automation of
some government agencies due to the government’s
limited capacity and a failure of partners to provide
the required assistance (Bangladesh Enterprise Insti-
tute, 2010; Siddiquee, 2012). The necessity for greater
interface between people and information gained
momentum after the enactment of the Right to Infor-
mation Act 2009. This also helped achieve the
Millennium Development Goals (MDG) using ICTand assisted the drive to be recognised as a middle
income nation by 2021 (‘Vision 2021’). ‘Digital Ban-
gladesh’ is the ICT-focussed agenda which focuses on
providing pro-poor services at their doorsteps (Jabbar,
2009; Karim et al, 2011). Acts and policies, including
those regarding ICT and telecommunications, were
realigned, emphasising a bottom-up approach involv-
ing various stakeholders in the implementation pro-
cess (Siddiquee and Faroqi, 2013). PPP is a useful
basis for building such ICT infrastructure and provi-
sion of digital services. The body responsible for
development of partnership driven e-services is
Access to Information (A2I), an advisory and techni-
cal assistance unit in the Prime Minister’s Office
assisted by the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) (Access to Information, 2011a).
The A2I developed an innovative quick-win solu-
tion, operating since 2010 to connect the rural citi-
zenry by establishing shared access premises in all
Union Parishads (UPs - the lowest tier of local gov-
ernment, each serving approximately 30,000 people).
This is now known as the ‘Union Digital Centre
(UDC)’project and represents a public-private-peo-
ple’s partnership (PPPP) model constituting the cen-
tral and local governments, the private entrepreneur
(Uddakta ), and the local people. Thus, the PPPP
builds upon general public-private partnership by
adding the people (local community) to the partner-
ship model. The UDC concept envisages the creation
of a knowledge-based society by serving as a focal
point for delivery of various government, commercial
and social services. It aims to minimise the digital
divide and finally connect rural masses (approxi-
mately 70 %of total population) to the information
superhighways. Run by two entrepreneurs, one male
and one female for social equity reasons, each UDC is
equipped with ICT equipment. It charges fees for
delivery, from which the entrepreneurs derive their
income. In total 4547 UDCs have been established.
Operated by the private partner with the support and
patronage of the local government, the aim is to
develop entrepreneurship and build community own-
ership (Access to Information, 2011b).
UDCs that are not performing to expectation expe-
rience fewer visits by people, frustrating the social
objectives (Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, 2014;
Prothom Alo, 2014). Barriers to success include
inadequacy of infrastructure, lack of private entrepre-
neurship, content problems, challenge in the inclusion
of disadvantaged, lack of back-end support and man-
agement inefficiency (Bangladesh Bureau ofFaroqi and Collings: Stakeholder involvement in Union Digital Centres in Bangladesh 3Statistics, 2014; Rahman and Bhuiyan, 2014; Siddi-
quee and Faroqi, 2013).
Stakeholder theory as a lens for the UDC Project
The theoretical model often used by researchers
(Bailur, 2007; Mishra and Dwivedi, 2012; Mishra and
Mishra, 2013) to identify partners under PPP origi-
nates from stakeholder theory (Mishra and Dwivedi,
2012). The purpose of an organisation is to create
value for its stakeholders, with failure to do so poten-
tially leading to collaps e (Freeman, 1984). Bailur
(2007) developed a framework for stakeholder analy-
sis for telecentre projects. In the first instance, this
requires identification of appropriate stakeholders and
an understanding of their behaviour to anticipate how
they work together and how conflict might arise. The
second phase involves ascertaining stakeholder
responsibilities - who to in form, consult, and give
partnership or control. Fin ally, coalition analysis
details how stakeholders would work together, which
can lead to a reiteration (Bailur, 2007; Mishra and
Dwivedi, 2012).
In an information system, the stakeholders are
“those who have a practical concern for the effective
application of new technologies, and who are in a
position to take or to influence decisions about why
and how they are used” (Boddy and Buchanan, cited
in Islam and Gronlund, 2007:168). The stakeholders
in a PPP telecentre would be the government (at both
central and local levels), the private sector (entrepre-
neur) and the community.
Roles of UDC stakeholders
Central government. The central government, as a pub-
lic partner, plays a key role by conferring support in
terms of policy, finance, technical and managerial
assistance, and infrastructure development during
initiation. They are responsible for policy support that
assists in the creation of a clear roadmap for prolif-
eration of telecentres and diffusion of the concept.
They provide equipment during start-up and further
funding via the UP, for supply of equipment. Appoint-
ment of the operators themselves is a role shared
between the central government and the UP.
An important ongoing role of the central govern-
ment is performance monitoring and information
sharing through field visits and online data collection.
To monitor the progress of UDC operations, an online
monitoring tool was created by the A2I which is
known as the UDC Activities Management System.Entrepreneurs are required to upload a daily activity
report. This allows centralised monitoring by the A2I,
Cabinet Division, LGD and the Deputy Commis-
sioner (DC) of the district. The best performers are
awarded annually with the help of local administra-
tion at national and district levels in categories such as
management officials, local representatives and entre-
preneurs. The UDC blog developed by A2I has
approximately 14,000 members, including manage-
ment officials and people’s representatives. The blog
serves three important roles: facilitating interactions
with fellow entrepreneurs; exchange with monitoring
officials; and sharing problems and innovative ideas.
According to an A2I official, nearly 70 %of problems
are solved through the blog.
Training and support are provided by the central
government. Entrepreneur training is provided by
government agencies such as the Bangladesh Com-
puter Council and A2I with the help of local admin-
istrative units. These agencies also conduct
workshops on awareness generation by involving peo-
ple’s representatives, government officials and entre-
preneurs. Ongoing technical support is provided by a
centrally administered helpdesk.
Importantly, the central government allows the
UDC to provide several services to the public that it
previously delivered itself. Transferring this financial
opportunity to the UDC not only supports the entre-
preneur, but also achieves community development
goals.
On a larger scale, the central government is respon-
sible for the services that support the “information
superhighway”, such as low cost broadband connec-
tivity and consistent power supply in remote commu-
nities (Jensen, 2007; Roman and Colle, 2002;
Wellenius, 2003). Beyond its direct roles, the central
government engages the UPs, providing them with
funding and direction to support and manage the proj-
ect at a local level.
Local government. The Union Parishad, represent-
ing a more local level of public partner, has a more
direct role within the UDC. In most facets of opera-
tion, they are the local government body that interacts
directly with the UDC. Their role is highly varied. In
the initial stages, they (with central government)
appoint and train entrepreneurs. The UP provides
physical premises and security and an element of
local supervision. Also, they provide the bulk of the
equipment needed for start-up, allocating finance sup-
plied by central government. Utilities, maintenance
and advertising are all costs largely taken on by the4 Information Development XX(X)UP in the initial stages of operation, with an expecta-
tion of subsequent transfer to the entrepreneur.
The UP must sign a contract with the entrepreneur
for three years with potential of renewal if both parties
are satisfied. This contract enforces the specific duties
of both parties and a short term permanency of the
entrepreneur, during which he/she cannot be removed
without arbitration from the local administration
(Local Government Division, 2010).
Entrepreneur. Unlike the public partners, the entre-
preneur has a role that is intended to both diversify
and intensify as the UDC becomes more established
and financially secure. In the initial stages, much of
the financial load is borne by the public partners.
However, with time, it is expected that the entrepre-
neur will increasingly shoulder this burden. This is
critical as it has been identified that many developing
countries find continued support of telecentre projects
challenging, leading to weak performance and closure
(Hanna, 2010; Proenza, 2001).
Entrepreneurs have contr actual obligations in
terms of time commitment to operate the UDC, pro-
viding services to the community. There is also an
obligation to invest at least 50,000 taka (US$ 650)
initially and also to provide accurate data about the
success of the operation and share their ideas with
other entrepreneurs. Thus they are involved in train-
ing of colleagues.
Many roles are likely to progressively become the
responsibility of the entrepreneur as financial stability
allows. These include training, maintenance of equip-
ment, improved premises, employment of additional
staff, and payment of utility bills and advertising
costs. With increasing experience, entrepreneurs are
expected to identify further avenues for provision of
services to the community and for profit.
The People. People’s participation as customers or
stakeholders of a telecentre is linked to its financial
status. Financial sustainability may be difficult given
a small client base with inadequate spending (Kumar,
2005).The market at the base of the social pyramid
can be tapped by tailoring services to the needs of this
community (Liyanage, 2009). Development goals,
such as improving the welfare of the poor, differenti-
ate a telecentre from commercial cybercafe ´s
(Proenza, 2001).Roman and Colle (2002) suggests
that raising awareness of the benefits of ICT, a busi-
ness plan consistent with community culture, and con-
tent related to the localit y can boost participation.
Involvement of people as stakeholders gives a sense
of community ownership, echoes local needs, andprovides the telecentre with local wisdom, volunteer-
ing and technical expertise. These constitute the
social capital of the venture (Hanna, 2010).
Policy guidelines dictate that the community must
play a role in the UDC management committee (Local
Government Division, 2010). The committee must
hold regular meetings every month for discussing and
evaluating activities and progress. It is also expected
to play an effective role in publicising the UDC across
the UP. A further role of the management committee,
and therefore partly determined by the community, is
to establish suggested fees for each service.
Methodology
A quantitative approach to assessing the demography
of entrepreneurs and their clientele, their facilities and
activities, and their perceptions of interactions with
the government was conducted through the use of a
web-based questionnaire. The decision to use an
Internet survey was based on its low cost and broad
reach (Couper and Bosnjak, 2010). This voluntary
survey was advertised through the UDC blog. Ulti-
mately 538 responded and although some questions
remained unanswered, a sample of this size is consid-
ered sufficient for the use of a Structured Equation
Model (SEM) (MacCallum et al, 1996).
The questions asked in the survey of entrepreneurs
addressed a broad range of topics: the demography
of both the providers (gender, location and computer
training level) and custo mers (volume and status of
disadvantage); partnership with government; the
range of equipment and services available; income
and investment; and problems faced. Additionally,
using a 5-point Likert scale , operators were surveyed
on their perception of change across the previous
12 months in: income; volume of service requests;
number of individual customers; range of services
available; mass awareness; participation of poor;
participation of women; and support from central
and local government. The use of perceived mea-
sures is necessary where baseline data are lacking
(Bhatnagar, 2009).
In contrast to the questionnaires, the qualitative
interviews targeted a different range of stakeholders.
In addition to entrepreneurs, UP personnel and central
government management officials were selected from
across the country. 19 entrepreneurs from 16 UDCs in
different geographic / administrative locations
(Dhaka, Chittagong, Rajshahi and Khulna) were inter-
viewed. Ten UP representatives and 12 centralFaroqi and Collings: Stakeholder involvement in Union Digital Centres in Bangladesh 5government officials related to those UDCs were
also interviewed. These were used to clarify the
conclusions of the quantitative findings rather than
being formally analysed in themselves. Respon-
dents were questioned on the perceived level of
support from different stak eholders, benefits to
users and challenges.
Quantitative data were analysed using SPSS and
AMOS version 21 (AMOS, 2012; SPSS, 2012).
Mann-Whitney U tests and Spearman rank correla-
tions were used because of a lack of normality in the
data. Given the lack of previous research, effect sizes
are interpreted as per Cohen’s (1988, cited in Gray
and Kinnear 2012) interpretation.
A structural equation model (SEM) was con-
structed to elucidate how financial and social out-
comes were dependent upon a range of factors
associated with customer base, entrepreneurial input
and government support (Figure 4). As suggested
elsewhere (Buhi et al, 2007; Schreiber et al, 2006),
this model used both observed and latent constructs as
direct and indirect inputs and outputs. This was based
on the entrepreneur’s view of perceived changes
across a single year of the following variables: partic-
ipation by poor; participation by women; mass aware-
ness; support from the UP; service supply from
central government; and technical assistance / train-
ing from central government. The first three of these
were used to create the latent input variable “people’s
participation” and the last three to create the latent
input variable, “external support”. The latent outcome
variable “progress” was constructed from the
observed perceptions of entrepreneurs on the change
over the previous year in monthly income, volume of
service requests, number of customers, and the
number of services delivered. Investment of the
entrepreneur was also included. The error terms for
participation by women and participation by poor,
government service supply, government training and
technical support, total requests and monthly income
have been correlated based on suggestions from mod-
ification indices as recommended by Cole et al (2007)
and Landis et al (2009).
Reflective measures have been preferred in con-
struct building to avoid conceptual ambiguity, low
internal consistency and bias in estimates (Edwards,
2011; Hardin et al, 2010; Howell et al, 2013). The
missing values are dealt with in the SEM model by
the use of Full-Information Maximum Likelihood
(FIML) available in AMOS for correct standard errors
(Graham and Coffman, 2012).Limitations of the study
As data was collected through voluntary means,
representativeness is debatable. However, it comes
from all seven administrative divisions of the country,
with responses approximately proportional to the
number of entrepreneurs in each. Pragmatic consid-
erations prevented a longitudinal method of assessing
progress. The SEM model development is explora-
tory, creating ad hoc measures. However, it is justi-
fied given the lack of a prior model.
Investment is considered the sole indicator of the
entrepreneur’s involvement since this occurs only
when they are confident of other qualities such as com-
puter and marketing skills and understanding of the
business risks (Liyanage, 2009). Progress over a single
year is assumed to be related to the entrepreneur’s
investment generally which came from accumulated
savings over past years, as confirmed by interview.
Results
Response rate and missing data
Nationally, 538 entrepreneurs responded to the inter-
net survey out of 2094, representing a 26 %of
response rate which is not unusual for an online sur-
vey (Nulty, 2008; Shih and Fan, 2008). Across all
respondents and questions, there was a missing data
rate of 18 %.
External support from government and local
government
Equipment and connectivity. A broad range of electronic
equipment is available across the majority of UDCs.
Modems, scanners, desktop and laptop computers,
cameras, colour and laser printers, multimedia projec-
tors and photocopiers are available in more than half
of all UDCs whilst independent power sources and
nebulisers are available in significantly fewer loca-
tions (Figure 1). While a photocopier is lacking in
40%of UDCs, the presence of a multimedia projector
in 80%is significant as an advertising medium.
Absence of generator or solar panel (66 %) hampers
service delivery since electricity in rural areas is unre-
liable (Sarker, 2013). Of those UDCs with Internet
connection, only 10 %had broadband connection
while 90 %of them relied on slow dial-up or mobile
Internet connection.
Supply of services by the UDC. Entrepreneurs were
asked about the services utilised by customers and the
proportion of income derived from each.6 Information Development XX(X)Approximately, 30 %of income comes from certifi-
cates and 20 %of income from commercial/ private
services (Table 1). The remaining income is generated
from 10 other types of services, none of which con-
tribute more than 10 %of income individually. For all
services, the standard deviation and range associated
with the proportion of income were large.
Entrepreneur involvement
Gender, training and contract status. Although recruit-
ment conditions dictate that half of the entrepreneurs
should be female, only 10 %of survey respondents
were female. While 68 %of respondents had 6 months
or more of computer training, 7 %received no formal
training at all. Remarkably, no female reported tertiary
level training. A large percentage of entrepreneurs
(43%) did not have any formal contract with the UP
and among these 57 %are female.
Income and investment. UDCs do not represent a
very profitable enterprise for many entrepreneurs.
Forty percent of entrepreneurs have a monthly income
of 5000 taka (65 USD) or less after subtracting costs
and only 30 %earn more than 10,000 taka (Figure 2).
Despite this, there are a small number of operators
(4%) reporting monthly incomes in excess of 25,000
taka. Monthly income is higher for entrepreneurs
having a contract with the UP (Mann-Whitney U ¼
28545.5; p<0.01; Cliff’s d ¼0.14, a small effect).
Those with broadband connections had higher incomethan those with dial-up (Mann-Whitney U ¼8081;
p¼0.03; Cliff’s d ¼0.18, a small effect).
Private investment is meagre (Figure 3). Although
the UDCs had been running for 3 years, 47 %of
operators had invested less than 20,000 taka and
9%had invested nothing. Only 23 %had met the
minimum specified level of investment (50,000 taka
/ US$ 650). Income was correlated with investment
(Spearman Rank Correlation rho þ/-CI¼
.281þ/-0.076; p < .01).
Operational challenges encountered by entrepre-
neurs. Internet unreliability (failure or slow speed)
was identified by the greatest proportion of entre-
preneurs (35 %) as being the principal problem that
they faced (Figure 4). Power failure was ranked as
the most important issue by almost as many (34 %).
The least important issue was lack of government
training (2 %).
The People as a partner
Customer patronage levels. On average each UDC
can serve approximately 30,000 people (World Bank,
2015). Despite this, 50 %of UDCs have less than 250
visits in a month. Indeed, about 6 %experience less
than 50 visits. Conversely, half of them have more
than 250 visits in a month, with 31 %receiving 251-
500 visits and the remaining 19 %attending to 501 or
more visits. The distribution of visits per UDC is
normally distributed with a mean of 285 þ/- 18.5
visits (mean þ/-CI). The monthly patronage of people0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0 1 0 0Internet Modem

Serving the disadvantaged
A considerable proportion of the clientele of UDCs
can be considered as disadvantaged because of gen-
der, financial situation or illiteracy. Approximately 90
percent of entrepreneurs consider that their female
service recipients constitute between 10 %and 50%
of their clientele (Table 2). Almost half of the entre-
preneurs (49 %) believe that over half their customers
could be considered poor. Illiterate people are thethird class of disadvantaged people who, according to
entrepreneurs, commonly utilise the service delivery
provision of UDCs; 25 %of operators consider that
illiterate people constitute more than half of their cli-
entele. The participation of disadvantaged people high-
lights the UDCs’ ability to bridge the digital divide.
However, the UDCs are yet to form any management
committee involving people (Local Government Divi-
sion (LGD), 2010), as the interview suggests.
The dynamics of stakeholders’ involvement
and progress across a year
The entrepreneurs’ perception of the extent of change
in people’s support and governmental support informs
our understanding of the dynamics of UDC stake-
holders and the way they are evolving to affect the
financial and social goals. The largest increases in
stakeholder input occurred in mass awareness, num-
ber of visits, and participation by the poor and women
(Table 3). Only moderate increase occurred in
monthly income, total requests and number of ser-
vices delivered. Lesser increases occurred in service
supply from the government, technical and training
support from local administration and cooperation
from the UP.
The theoretical basis for the construction of the
SEM (Figure 4) was based on the identification of
this project as a Public-Private-People’s partnership,
constructing latent variables representing these sec-
tors. The good model fit indicates that this is an appro-
priate representation of the system (CMIN/DF ¼
2.48; NFI ¼.95; CFI ¼.97; TLI ¼.95; RFI ¼.92;
and RMSEA ¼.05). It is not unexpected that the
w2value produced by the model is significant
(w2
(41)¼102, p<.000), given the large sample size
(Schreiber et al, 2006).
Whilst the model identifies UDC progress as being
significantly affected by external support, people’s
support, and entrepreneurial investment (p<0.01 for
all direct regression paths), the respective regression
values indicate that a UDC’s progress depends more
on external support (government and UP) and peo-
ple’s support, than on entrepreneurial investment.
Changes in ‘people’s support’, ‘external support’ and
investment by the entrepreneur account for 83 %of the
variance in ‘progress’ (Figure 4).
In terms of direct effects, ‘people’s support’ is the
most influential across all factors (path value of 0.73;
Figure 5).External support from the government and
UP has a lesser but still important contribution (0.23)Table 1. Service availability, expressed as the percentage

tribution (0.10). This would indicate that a change in
entrepreneurial investment of one standard deviation
would directly cause a change of 0.10 standard devia-
tions in annual progress.
The external support and the entrepreneur’s invest-
ment also have indirect effects on progress through
people’s support. The indirect effect from external
support on progress is 0.44 (0.60 x 0.73).Conversely,
the indirect effect from the entrepreneur’s investment
is only 0.13 (0.18 x 0.73). All indirect paths are sta-
tistically significant (p<0.01).
The total effect identified by the SEM is calculated
by combining the direct and indirect path values. Thisclearly indicates that external funding affects progress
of the UDC to a far greater degree than entrepreneur-
ial investment. Overall, investment by the entrepre-
neur has a total effect of only 0.23 (0.10 þ0.13),
whilst external support has a far larger total effect
of 0.67 (0.23 þ0.44).
The model includes three correlated error terms
between (a) two indicators of people’s participation
(“Participation by women” and “Participation by
poor”); (b) two indicators of external support
(“Government service supply” and “Government
training and technical support”) and (c) two indicators
of progress (“Total requests” and “Monthly income”).

(Cole et al, 2007; Landis et al, 2009) and not only
by model fit improvement as suggested by large mod-
ification indices. It is argued that all pairs of above-
mentioned indicators point to sub-dimensions within
the main domains of people’s participation, external
support and progress respectively. Future studies
should aim to measure more indicators designed to
quantify, for example, people’s participation versus
awareness. This would allow for second order confir-
matory factor analysis (CFA) to be used or alterna-
tively both concepts investigated independently in the
structural model.
Discussion
Level of entrepreneurial investment
The SEM showed path values which indicated that a
change in government support had a far greater effect
than a change in private investment (total effect of
0.67 vs 0.23). This might appear to indicate that
increasing entrepreneurial input is not as likely to
improve progress as increased public spending. How-
ever, this needs to be viewed in terms of the current
level of input from these sectors. While the path value
indicates the change caused by a single standard
deviation change in entrepreneur or government
input, these two changes are very different in absolute
terms. It is likely to represent a large change in gov-
ernment spending, but (as entrepreneurs typically
invest little), very little change in absolute terms for
an entrepreneur. Thus, the apparent lack of effect of a
change in entrepreneurial investment is simply areflection of the current low contributions from this
source. However, this is unlikely to continue.
While the people’s support including participation
of disadvantaged is desirable for sustainability (Well-
enius, 2003), external support cannot be taken for
granted since the government’s aim is to reduce sub-
sidies (Access to Information, 2011b). Increased
entrepreneurial investment is needed to own and oper-
ate this project in the future as dictated by the PPPP
contract (Local Government Division, 2010). Thus,
there are challenges which must be addressed in the
stakeholders’ engagement.
It is necessary to discuss the challenge of develop-
ing entrepreneurship and operational and manage-
ment hurdles assuming that these evolve from lack
of engagement of relevant stakeholders. This
approach helps us to explain stakeholder behaviour
and their management in terms of whether stake-
holders are informed, consulted or given partnership
or control. This discussion is expected to illuminate
future prospects (Bailur, 2007; Freeman, 1984).
Reasons for lack of entrepreneurship
In addition to low investment by entrepreneurs (Fig-
ure 3), nine of the 16 UDCs which were interviewed
had replaced their entrepreneur two or three times in
three years. Interviews suggested that high drop-out
rate and inadequate investment were associated
with deficiencies in gender balance, training, con-
tractual agreement and income. The goal of
improving female participation is still unmet as
evidenced by low female survey participation rates
(<10%) and the fact that interviews identified a
lack of regular involvement.
Issues with entrepreneur engagement begin during
the identification process. Most entrepreneurs were
rural unemployed youths such as students, sourced
through personal or political acquaintances. They
were identified by the UP chairman and confirmed
by local administrators. Interviews with management
confirmed that recruitment prerequisites relating to
minimum qualification, investment capacity and con-
tract enforcement were not followed strictly because
computer skilled, willing entrepreneurs, capable of
investment, were rare.
Many operators were not able to commit to the task
full-time and low-income entrepreneurs cannot invest
further to expand the business. These entrepreneurs
leave relatively quickly. Females tend to leave faster
than their male counterparts, often because of poorTable 2. Number and percentage of entrepreneurs who

allow their male partner progression. Interviews
indicated that male drop-outs are mainly the result
of low income due to low entrepreneurial capacity,
conflict with the UP or mobility for better jobs.
Replacement with alternative entrepreneurs is gen-
erally slow, decreasing the service and income of the
UDC.
In terms of stakeholder management, operators are
not consulted adequately about the modus operandi or
nature of the partnership. Weak consultation is
reflected in the provision of only rudimentary com-
puter training and nothing to improve marketing or
managerial skills. Entrepreneurs who joined morerecently lack even this training (Prothom Alo,
2015). Moreover, although entrepreneurs are consid-
ered as ambassadors of the project, the UP and central
administration have delegated little control. They are
placed under the control of the UP secretary and
treated as part-time employees who can be dismissed
at will. Central government officials often consider
them subservient trainees. This is problematic as
many believe that the partnership should provide
them with the levels of permanence, authority and
salary of a UP secretary. Existence of a contract was
associated with financial success and improves the
situation. This is expected, as consultation and clear
rules help avoid conflict.Table 3. Entrepreneurs’ perceptions of change in facets of stakeholder involvement and progress across 12 months.

Problem
Figure 4. Principal operational problems identified by entrepreneurs.Faroqi and Collings: Stakeholder involvement in Union Digital Centres in Bangladesh 11Operational challenges
Entrepreneurship is beset by a number of operational
problems (Figure 4). Of these, the most significant
were identified as Internet reliability and power
breakdowns.
Internet connection dropout/slow speed. The over-
whelming majority of entrepreneurs use dial-up or
mobile Internet connectivity which is slow and prone
to breakdown. This hinders access to the Internet and
consequently demand for e-services (Hanna, 2010).
The problem is less severe for those few who can
afford access to broadband which provides better
speed and is associated with greater income. The Ban-
glaGovNet Project , undertaken by the government, is
providing faster fibre-optic network infrastructure
nationwide. In the interim, the existing 3G mobile
broadband connection, which currently covers the
vicinity of district or sub-district headquarters, should
be extended throughout all rural areas of the country
(Bangladesh Computer Council, 2014). To further
improve the situation, a World Bank funded project
has connected 100 UDCs through fibre-optic line.
Internet costs should be subsidised for entrepreneurs
to provide a wider range of services.
Power breakdown. Power failures are common in
rural areas, typically occurring 3 or 4 times per day.
Battery powered laptops, generators or solar panels
may represent solutions. To that end, by the end of2014, the government has supplied at least one laptop
to all UDCs and solar panels to 1013, where there was
previously no electricity . A government project
financed by the Climate Change Trust Fund equipped
another 3208 UDCs with solar panels. Similarly,
uninterruptable power supplies offer a short term bat-
tery powered backup which may alleviate black-outs.
Nevertheless, installation and proper maintenance are
still issues, as are concerns of theft and the cost of
purchase and fuelling of generators.
Equipment problems. Whilst UDCs are relatively
well resourced with ICT equipment (Figure 1), there
is often inadequate office space and furniture. Inter-
views with entrepreneurs suggest that inoperative
equipment is a problem for some where funding by
the UP is not as generous as for others. However,
support is decreasing (Table 3) as the UP prioritises
other programmes. The Social Obligation Fund being
collected from telecom providers collected US$6.3
million to the end of 2014 (Shawki, 2014) and could
be used for interim maintenance of equipment.
Low income because of poor public patronage.
Ensuring greater income for entrepreneurs is vital
to reducing dropout rate. Unsurprisingly, income
and public attendance are correlated (Faroqi,
2015). However, until rec ently, a typical UDC only
served approximately 1 %of the population in a
month (Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, 2014). The

priate facilities to attract people. A voucher system
for financially disadvantaged people would
improve participation an d income for the entrepre-
neur (Information Communication Technology
Agency, 2010).
Dearth of government services for the public.
Many government-based services are not made avail-
able for UDCs to provide. Some government services
such as land ownership certificates, passport, teleme-
dicine or electricity payments are available in less
than half of UDCs. Although entrepreneurs can derive
some earnings from commercial services, they are
missing out on these income opportunities. Other ser-
vices that might be provided include: online pass-
ports; welfare allowances through mobile banking;
land certificate/ land tax; special services for poor/
women/illiterates; and complaints to police. Such ser-
vices, currently delivered from distant government
delivery points, have the potential to increase turn-
over within the UDC. The InfoSarker Project is now
w o r k i n go nt r a n s f o r m a t i o no fm a n u a ls e r v i c e si n t o
e-services (Bangladesh Computer Council, 2015).
UDCs could provide these services. To supplement
local needs, entrepreneurs could be engaged for cre-
ating local e-content (Informaiton Communication
Technology Agency, 2010).
Lack of awareness and entrepreneur training.
Lack of awareness among citizens and lack of entre-
preneurial training are considered to be the least
problematic issues (Figure 4). The UDCs are well-
advertised, as reflected in the recent increase in
patronage, particularly the participation of the disad-
vantaged (Table 2). However, the formation of UDC
management committees involving local people
(Local Government Division, 2010) could have
been used to boost awareness and to formalise
them as partners. The involvement of people as
stakeholders is useful for dissemination, determin-
ing demand, and provision of assistance (Kumar
and Best, 2006). Few entrepreneurs considered lack
of training to be their greatest hurdle (Figure 4),
but interviews did suggest that it was a factor
affecting delivery and subsequent income.
Management challenges. Entrepreneurial and
operational problems have their roots in management
practices. There are challenges related to management
that include model choice and stakeholder involve-
ment, monitoring and networking. In terms of model
choice, other options such as NGO or private-led
models have not been considered. The lack of robustprograms to support home-grown entrepreneurs is a
serious concern. As not all entrepreneurs regularly
upload reports to the UDC Activities Management
System, it is impossible to monitor their progress. In
Bogra district, for instance, only 30 of 109 UDCs
uploaded reports daily. Monthly reports to the local
administration are often irregular and inaccurate.
Similarly, entrepreneurs suggested that visits by mon-
itoring officials are infrequent.
Management officials suggest that only 3000
entrepreneurs are regular contributors to the UDC
blog. Establishing separate networking organisations
could facilitate exchange of knowledge across man-
agers, implementers and users (Hanna, 2010). No
rigorous evaluation exercise has been undertaken
to facilitate coalition ana lysis (Freeman, 1984). This
would identify ways for stakeholders to better work
together. The government appears to have not fol-
lowed best practice in these areas by learning from
the experience of other deve loping countries such as
India and Sri Lanka. Franchising the recruitment,
training and evaluation to specialised private sector
entities could also be considered (Shadrach and
Sharma, 2013).
Conclusion
As a quick-win initiative, the UDC has been estab-
lished as a close access point for rural people in all the
local government units of Bangladesh. External sup-
port from the central government and the UP is con-
sidered modest by the operators themselves. ICT
equipment is plagued by slow Internet speed, power
blackouts and a lack of access to government services.
Despite such limitations, the UDC is increasingly
becoming attractive to more people, particularly the
disadvantaged. An increase in community and exter-
nal support can largely explain current progress in the
face of an underwhelming contribution by entrepre-
neurs, a fact supported by the SEM.
Overdependence on external support and inade-
quate entrepreneur investment is weakening the
development of UDCs. Moreover, very few operators
have entrepreneurial skills. Entrepreneurial income
and investment have roles in building the system and
preventing dropout. As the principal management sta-
keholder, the government must establish faster con-
nectivity, allow UDCs to supply a greater range of
services and facilitate investment loans to increase
income and growth. The UP’s role in recruitment and
control of entrepreneurs should be reviewed byFaroqi and Collings: Stakeholder involvement in Union Digital Centres in Bangladesh 13coalition analysis. UDCs must be promoted as an
enterprise by consulting entrepreneurs, providing
training and giving them more control. The govern-
ment’s attempts to complement power supply are
encouraging, but efforts to improve Internet have
had minimal impact. Hence, new stakeholders are
required for developing infrastructure to provide
faster Internet. Training, technical support, and
monitoring can be better managed by outsourcing
to competent providers or establishing network
organisation. Greater public participation is possi-
ble because of the large population lacking per-
sonal access to ICT, but they must be given true
partnership as stakeholde rs. A realistic and effec-
tive implementation of the complex public-private-
people’s partnership is required to allow progress
of the UDC concept in Bangladesh.
