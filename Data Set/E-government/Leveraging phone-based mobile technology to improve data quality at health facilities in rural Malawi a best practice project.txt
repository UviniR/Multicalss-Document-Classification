Abstract 
Background: To further reduce malaria burden, identification of areas with highest burden for targeted interven-
tions needs to occur. Routine health information has the potential to indicate where and when clinical malaria occurs 
the most. Developing countries mostly use paper-based data systems however they are error-prone as they require 
manual aggregation, tallying and transferring of data. Piloting was done using electronic data capture (EDC) with a 
cheap and user friendly software in rural Malawian primary healthcare setting to improve the quality of health records.
Methods: Audit and feedback tools from the Joanna Briggs Institute (Practical Application of Clinical Evidence 
System and Getting Research into Practice) were used in four primary healthcare facilities. Using this approach, the 
best available evidence for a malaria information system (MIS) was identified. Baseline audit of the existing MIS was 
conducted in the facilities based on available best practice for MIS; this included ensuring data consistency and com-
pleteness in MIS by sampling 25 random records of malaria positive cases. Implementation of an adapted evidence-
based EDC system using tablets on an OpenDataKit platform was done. An end line audit following implementation 
was then conducted. Users had interviews on experiences and challenges concerning EDC at the beginning and end 
of the survey.
Results: The existing MIS was paper-based, occupied huge storage space, had some data losses due to torn out 
papers and were illegible in some facilities. The existing MIS did not have documentation of necessary parameters, 
such as malaria deaths and treatment within 14 days. Training manuals and modules were absent. One health centre 
solely had data completeness and consistency at 100% of the malaria-positive sampled records. Data completeness 
and consistency rose to 100% with readily available records containing information on recent malaria treatment. 
Interview findings at the end of the survey showed that EDC was acceptable among users and they agreed that the 
tablets and the OpenDataKit were easy to use, improved productivity and quality of care.
Conclusions: Improvement of data quality and use in the Malawian rural facilities was achieved through the intro -
duction of EDC using OpenDataKit. Health workers in the facilities showed satisfaction with the use of EDC.

transmission settings, there are geographical and sea -
sonal variations of malaria burden [2]. Individual, house -
hold, community and environmental factors affect the 
distribution of malaria infection. Identifying and address -
ing these variations may inform targeted interventions to 
reduce the burden of malaria in affected communities.
The World Health Organization’s (WHO) Global 
Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-30 (GTS) suggests 
the transformation of malaria surveillance into a core 
intervention which would allow the capture of essen -
tial malaria data on a continuous basis thereby improv -
ing response to outbreaks, assessment of disease trends 
and optimization of responses [3]. This strategy further 
explains that surveillance of malaria should be utilized 
to inform appropriate action [3]. Strong surveillance 
systems linked to effective responses are critical for 
malaria elimination [4, 5]. The process of data collection 
together with reporting, active case finding, and linkage 
to response must be swift in endemic settings for proper 
identification of infections, prevention of ongoing trans -
mission, and decrease transmission efficiency of vectors 
[4, 5]. In a majority of sub-Saharan African (SSA) coun -
tries, routine malaria surveillance involves collecting 
and reporting aggregate data from public health facilities 
through the national health management information 
systems (HMIS) [6]. Generally, malaria burden is moni -
tored using household surveys or routinely collected 
health information. Household surveys are costly to con -
duct and analyse, and are usually based on a cross sec -
tional design in a proportion of the population [7]. The 
cross-sectional design does not allow monitoring of bur -
den over time.
Data collected in health facility registers for patients 
tested for malaria are valuable for monitoring trends in 
malaria morbidity and evaluating the impact of malaria 
control interventions [8]. However, the data may be 
incomplete, unreliable and paper-based and, therefore, 
prone to errors during manual tallying [6]. In addition, 
facilities may use several registers for a single patient 
making it complex to easily access individual patient 
information [9]. When it comes to reporting from pri -
mary health-care facilities to secondary health-care 
facilities, these data are aggregated by test result and age 
category; the aggregated reports lose valuable informa -
tion including its location.
Most health facilities in Malawi use paper-based reg -
isters to record and report routine malaria information. 
The paper-based registers are also used to record other 
illnesses at the facility. For each illness, the records are 
tallied and compiled into an aggregated report, which is 
physically sent to the district health office. The reports 
from all health facilities in the district are entered into 
the district health information system (DHIS) using a computer. This system, as already elaborated above 
presents a number of challenges more especially with 
errors that have not been addressed during primary data 
collection.
Malawi’s national malaria operational plan includes 
goals to improve the country’s capacity to collect and 
use information and to adapt to changing epidemiol -
ogy and incorporate new tools by 2020 [10]. For moni -
toring progress towards achievement of these goals, a 
system for capturing both local and regional transmis -
sion is essential. Particularly, there is a need for an effec -
tive surveillance system that can monitor near real-time 
malaria data, target focal areas of infection, increase 
capacity to identify transmission hotspots and rapidly 
identify changes in malaria transmission, morbidity and 
mortality.
In this paper, a description of an evidence-based qual -
ity improvement project for a malaria information system 
conducted at four health facilities in a rural community 
of Chikwawa in Southern Malawi was done. The overall 
goal was to develop and deploy an evidence-based best 
practice system to improve the quality and use of the 
health information system. Lessons learned and expe -
riences related to implementation of the system were 
discussed.
Methods
Study design
The JBI approach to evidence implementation was fol -
lowed [11], including the use of the Practical Applica -
tion of Clinical Evidence System (PACES) software [11] 
and Getting Research into Practice (GRiP) framework for 
promoting evidence based health care following attend -
ance at an evidence implementation training programme, 
funded through a competitive scholarship [12–14]. This 
approach involves three phases of activity:
1. Establishing a team for the project and undertaking a 
baseline audit based on criteria informed by the evi -
dence.
2. Reflecting on the results of the baseline audit, provid -
ing feedback and designing and implementing strate -
gies to address non-compliance found in the baseline 
audit informed by the JBI GRiP framework.
3. Conducting a follow up audit to assess the out -
comes of the interventions implemented to improve 
practice, and identify future practice issues to be 
addressed in subsequent audits.
Project site
The project was conducted from September 2018 to 
January 2019 in 4 health facilities namely Chapananga, Page 3 of 11
 Tizifa et al. Malar J          (2021) 20:203 
 
Kakoma, Kapichira and Majete 1 in the southern 
Malawi district of Chikwawa. The facilities are situated 
within the catchment area of the Majete wildlife reserve 
(MWR). This project site has been previously described 
[15], but briefly the catchment area is characterized by 
highly heterogeneous land use for subsistence farm -
ing and small scale business. Chikwawa has a hot and 
humid tropical climate for most of the year. Some of the 
services offered in these facilities include out-patient 
department (OPD), maternity, under-five clinic and 
immunization.
Ethical considerations
The project was registered as a quality improvement 
activity within the health centres, and therefore did not 
require ethical approval. Approval to conduct the pro -
ject in Chikwawa district was however provided by the 
Chikwawa District Health Office.
Data collection
The WHO established standard protocols for moni -
toring and surveillance of malaria treatment, both in 
children and adults, specifically from low and middle-
income countries (LMIC) [16, 17] helped in coming 
up with this approach. The literature was explored to 
obtain evidence on the best available practice for elec -
tronic monitoring of the quality of malaria treatment 
in children living in LMIC which was synthesized in an 
evidence summary and informed the criteria develop -
ment. The data collection process was categorized into four phases, with these phases progressing in sequen -
tial order.
Phase 1: team establishment and baseline audit
The first phase of the project was to form a core project 
team to provide technical, logistical and strategic guid -
ance. During this phase, a team to coordinate all project 
activities was established and comprised of health care 
workers (HCW) from Chikwawa district health office 
(DHO), particularly data clerks and medical assistants. 
Data clerks are a cadre within the Malawian health sys -
tem whose role is to conduct data entry and aggregation 
at specific health facilities. On the other hand, medi -
cal assistants are a cadre of clinicians within the health 
system, whose role is to provide primary care of patients 
in primary health facilities (health centres and dispensa -
ries). All the four implementing health centres had these 
cadres. Some members from the DHO that were incorpo -
rated include the District Medical Officer (DMO) and the 
health management information system (HMIS) officer. 
Others team members included information technology 
specialists, masters’ student, PhD student and a postdoc -
toral researcher all working with the College of Medicine, 
University of Malawi. DHO personnel provided support 
in engagement of the health centres. Health centre per -
sonnel were to be the implementers of the project. The 
composition and roles of personnel are summarized in 
Additional file 1: Appendix 1.
After forming the team, audit criteria were developed 
(Table  1). A structured questionnaire was created and 
administered to the health facility in-charges (usually 
medical assistants) and data clerks to assess the exist -
ing health facility information system. Furthermore,

documentation of roles and responsibilities of personnel 
at each level of the data monitoring system was checked. 
Questions concerning the existence of training manuals 
and modules for the monitors together with the type of 
infrastructure at each facility were raised.
In order to determine prior treatment of malaria within 
14 days, a checklist was also developed for OPD, labora -
tory and anti-malarial registers. In addition, records of 
25 randomly selected malaria positive patients in each 
facility were checked for completeness and internal con -
sistency. Completeness was assessed by checking that all 
required data elements had a recording while consistency 
was assessed by comparing the data in all the three regis -
ters. This audit required a total of two days with a maxi -
mum of three hours at each site for it to be completed.
Phase 2: design and implementation of strategies 
to improve practice: GRiP strategy
After obtaining the baseline audit results, the pro -
ject team identified strategies that would help address 
the bottlenecks in data management. The team devel -
oped an electronic case report form (eCRF) based on 
the existing malaria, rapid diagnostic tests and OPD 
registers ensuring that the eCRF (Additional file  1: 
Appendix  2) was a digital replica of the paper based 
forms (Additional file  1: Appendix  3). The eCRF was 
designed using (Extensible Markup Language) XML 
script, accounting for all the variables which were on 
the paper-based register and available evidence for 
electronic monitoring of the quality of malaria treat -
ment in children in low and middle-income countries. 
Testing of the eCRF was first done by the project team, 
to ensure that all skip logic functioned, and all the 
required data and variables were being collected by the 
electronic form. In order for data collection to occur 
at the health centres, Samsung android tablets from 
Majete malaria project were installed an application 
called Open Data Kit (ODK); the eCRF was uploaded 
and configured to run as a client for data collection on 
these Samsung tablets (Additional file  1: Appendix  4). 
It was an opportunity of having a research project that 
had been using Samsung android tablets for data collec -
tion. Permission for use of these devices in the facilities 
was granted by the project. Electronic data capturing 
(EDC) was to take place in the health facilities with 
Samsung android tablets having ODK software. ODK 
is an open source android application, which can be 
used to capture disaggregated individual records using 
mobile devices; the records can be sent remotely to a 
server or desktop and is immediately accessible using 
a specific Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and appro -
priate log in credentials. ODK can collect text, numeric 
data, images and geographical coordinates in resource limited settings by people with minimal education 
qualifications [18]. ODK can run both on Windows 
machines and Android tablets, however, android tab -
lets were selected because they have superior battery 
life and require minimal technical knowledge to oper -
ate as compared to windows machines.
In addition to Android tablets and Windows, ODK can 
also run on MacOs and iOS using Kobo toolbox, Enketo 
and GIC collect [19]. These applications support offline 
data collection and form submission [20]. Considering 
that all the ODK collect alternatives are used in survey-
based data gathering, works without network connec -
tivity and manages a very large range of question and 
answer types like ODK collect, it was possible to use the 
iOS for data collection, however the latter is too expen -
sive for this environment and it would require a lot of 
technical investment.
Electronic data capturing systems have been used 
across Africa, in various forms. A systematic review look -
ing at the use of EDC in African settings revealed that 
91% reported use of Open Source healthcare software, 
with OpenMRS being the most widely used [21]. Experi -
ences of using EDCs tend to be similar across the con -
tinent with major successes being greater data accuracy, 
improved timeliness, availability of routine reports and 
reduced data duplication [21–23]. Despite these suc -
cesses, challenges have also been documented on the use 
of EDCs in sub-Saharan Africa; these include high cost 
of set-up and maintenance of EDC, low level of infor -
mation and communications technology (ICT) literacy, 
poor infrastructure and power outages [21, 23]. EDCs 
have been piloted and used in Malawi before mostly in 
research settings. In a study by King et al., four different 
EDC systems were piloted in rural areas with the aim of 
highlighting advantages and disadvantages of each system 
through personal experiences of fieldworkers, project 
managers, and EDC system developers [24]. They have 
also been used at tertiary health facilities (central hos -
pitals) mostly in the form of electronic medical records 
(EMR), however they usually look at one condition [25, 
26]. The most common one is the EMR in the form of a 
touchscreen system at the point of care (POC) to moni -
tor and support antiretroviral therapy (ART) scale up 
[26]. This was first piloted in April 2006, at Queen Eliza -
beth Central Hospital (QECH), a specialized and referral 
hospital, located in Blantyre City, southern Malawi, and 
scaled-up to other tertiary institutions in the subsequent 
years [26]. With the efficiency of EDC in data collection 
and transmission in research studies, that the authors 
have had an experience in, and the few scenarios of use at 
tertiary level of care, it was necessary to incorporate the 
suggestions raised by the stakeholders from the health 
facilities and the district management team during the Page 5 of 11
 Tizifa et al. Malar J          (2021) 20:203 
 
meeting to use a form of electronic data capturing. This 
would try to provide a solution to the problems of data 
management.
A meeting was scheduled with health care work -
ers (medical assistants and data clerks), HMIS officer 
and DMO, to discuss the gaps and challenges identified 
with the existing system through the baseline audit, and 
the proposed evidence-based practice for malaria infor -
mation system. There was an orientation and feedback 
session based on the proposed system. During the discus -
sion and orientation, possible challenges were explored to 
the use of EDC and the strategies and resources required 
to address them. A large concern was regarding the bat -
tery lifespan of the devices and the additional workload 
required to concurrently implement both paper and elec -
tronic systems.
Specific attention was given to the facility data clerks, 
since they are the ones that would be using the tablets to 
enter data. It was ensured that they understood how to 
conduct the data collection, and once completed, be able 
to send all the collected outpatient data (not only malaria 
patients) for their respective facilities to the central 
repository housed at the district health office of which 
the HMIS officer had administrative rights. The exist -
ing system of data entry and aggregation where patients’ 
information and treatment is entered into the registers 
after they have been assisted at the point of care (POC) 
and all the necessary procedures and treatment have 
been done was adopted. Data clerks used the tablets for 
data entry at these aggregation points. During the meet -
ing, emphasis was placed on the need to follow all the 
necessary procedures and documentation for the man -
agement of patients at health facilities, despite the intro -
duction of the EDC. When it comes to documentation 
at the health facilities, patient’s health booklets are the 
essential data tools and they form an interphase between 
the various service points in the facility. In the study 
sites, when a patient was seen at the POC, the medi -
cal assistant documented the necessary plan concern -
ing the patient in the patient’s health booklet. This was 
then taken by the patient to the next POC, e.g. the labo -
ratory where the plan documented by the clinician such 
as malaria testing was executed by the laboratory staff. 
Afterwards, documentation of the results in the patient’s 
health booklets was done by the POC. The patient would 
then follow-up with the clinician and the clinician would 
write the necessary plan or treatment depending on the 
results to either be received at the pharmacy within the 
facility or purchase, depending on the circumstances, 
in client’s health booklet. After receiving the treatment, 
the patient would present the health booklet to the data 
clerks where information was entered into the eMIS and 
the registers.Specific users such as the data clerks, DMO, were given 
access to the server and had some full control rights. 
The project team were assigned read only privileges to 
view the data only and monitor the data as it comes in. 
In addition, data cleaning scripts and report generating 
scripts were written to assist and automate the monthly 
report for each facility, as this was previously manually 
tallied by the data clerks on papers and transported via 
vehicle to the DHO office for data entry in their system.
The steps followed when coming up with the GRiP 
strategy were essential as they would help highlight the 
steps required in order to have a successful implemen -
tation programme that is acceptable by everyone. The 
whole team specifically the users proposed the adoption 
of a mobile based EDC using the ODK application.
Phase 3: follow up audit post implementation of change 
strategy
After implementation of the data collection tools, a 
follow-up audit of the health facilities was made. Data 
entered into the local server was checked for various 
parameters as assessed in the baseline audit.
Phase 4: end of survey assessment
A questionnaire for EDC assessment was developed 
which was used at the end of the survey to document the 
experience of users of the system.
Results
It was discovered that the current data capture system 
involves the use of registers in all facilities. There are a 
number of registers the Malawi government through 
the Ministry of Health developed and allocated to all the 
health facilities. Some of them include the out-patient 
(OPD) department, anti-malarial, laboratory, under-
five and maternity registers. Since the main condition 
of interest was malaria, assessment of the OPD, labora -
tory and anti-malarial registers was done. During phase 1 
when assessment of the health facilities was conducted, it 
was discovered that the current paper-based system had 
problems which included:
1. Torn and lost papers within the registers.
2. Illegible print (Additional file 1: Appendix 5).
3. Poor documentation by providers.
4. Use of multiple registers to capture data of an indi -
vidual.
5. Filled up registers occupied a lot of space in the facili -
ties reducing operational capacity (Additional file  1: 
Appendix 5).
Table  2 below summarizes comparisons between base -
line and follow-up audits. It shows that there was no Page 6 of 11 Tizifa et al. Malar J          (2021) 20:203 
existence of electronic management information system 
(eMIS) at the beginning of the survey compared to the 
end. The malaria information system (MIS) used at all 
health centres did not have some necessary parameters, 
which include captured deaths from malaria and malaria 
treatment within 14 days.
Baseline and follow‑up audits
Figure  1 shows results for data completeness and con -
sistency at baseline and follow up audits for 25 randomly 
selected records in the four health facilities. During the 
baseline audit, Kakoma was the only health centre that 
had data completeness and consistency at 100%. Majete 
1 and Kapichira had data consistency and completeness 
both above 80%. Chapananga had the least percentage in 
data consistency, 50% at baseline but attained 100% after 
the audit.
Getting research into practice (GRiP) strategy 
for identification of the barriers, strategies in addressing 
the barriers, and resources used to reach the intended 
outcome
The first barrier identified as impeding the success of 
EDC implementation was a lack of support from the 
district health office (DHO). During the baseline audit HCWs at health facilities expressed concerns that the 
DHO’s response to some issues or problems arising 
from some health facilities is generally slow. To find a 
solution to this problem, it was agreed that all parties 
involved should meet and discuss possible solutions. 
There had to be a mutual benefit for both parties, and 
the most likely one was that, because this would be an 
innovation, Chikwawa would be the country’s pioneer -
ing district for this innovation. The resources required 
for this meeting were the transportation of all partici -
pants from the health facilities to come for the EDC 
demonstration. At the end of the meeting, all issues 
were resolved, and the piloting of EDC implementation 
in selected health facilities in the district was approved.
Second, it was discovered that health facility data 
clerks may be hesitant to use EDC while maintaining 
registers because it would add to their workload. To 
overcome this situation, the proposed strategy was to 
engage the DHO and health facility managers during 
the baseline audit and orientation and explain the sig -
nificance of this pilot. Orientation meetings in which 
health facility personnel were trained on EDC and pro -
vided solutions to problems were held. The goal was 
met when electronic data was successfully collected 
and safely transmitted to the server.
Third, it was discovered that there was a lack of tech -
nical capacity among health facility data clerks to 
implement EDC. It was proposed that EDC be given ori -
entation and training so that data clerks can be involved 
in the design of data collection forms for ease of use. 
Furthermore, technical assistance would be provided as 
needed. The project team provided electronic tablets to 
ensure the success of the proposed strategy. In addition, 
the project team and data clerks created simplified elec -
tronic forms. Training on how to use the tablets was pro -
vided during the orientation. Supportive supervision was 
provided by the project team during the data collection 
process. As a result of this, electronic data was success -
fully collected and safely transmitted to the server.Table 2 Baseline and follow-up audit outcomes

Follow‑up interview findings
Users from all the facilities indicated that the EDC system 
was easy to use together with the use of electronic tablets 
and it made their work easier. They further established 
that the EDC improved their productivity and quality of 
care compared to the paper-based system. There were 
different views among users on whether the solutions 
that were developed and implemented met the intent of 
the promise. Some agreed with others highlighting that 
there were a number of changes made on the ODK form. 
Advantages that were mentioned by the users concerning 
EDC include:
1. Easy accessibility of data.
2. Fast.
3. Easy storage and management of data.
4. Easy to transmit and send data.
Despite this, the following disadvantages were 
mentioned:
1. The system required power supply, this posing a chal -
lenge at sites which had no access to the national 
grid.
2. Errors were noted in the ODK ranging from wrong 
spellings of villages/medication, improper dosages of 
some medications. These occurred when creating the 
ODK form.
3. Possible theft of the devices.
4. Difficult to send electronic data to district health 
office because of lack of phone airtime needed for a 
wireless connection.
5. Could not access the data to compile reports.
Local backup and data storage
The need to backup data at each health facility is essen -
tial. From the baseline audit results, it was identified that 
Chapangana, Kakoma and Majete health facilities did not 
have a laptop or computer facility. With these findings, it 
was difficult to have a backup of the tablet every day. This 
raised an on-going problem when the data was not sent 
to the server the same day, the date would be stored in 
that tablet until the data was sent to the central server. 
Solutions to mitigate these problems were suggested by 
the team. The initial plan was to assign airtime for inter -
net to the data clerks, however there was an oversight 
during budgeting, therefore, making it not feasible to 
allocate airtime to individual data clerks. To resolve this, 
a discussion was done with the HMIS officer at the DHO 
so that data collected on a weekly basis in the tablets 
should be sent to his office by assigning the data officer, to travel to the sites and send any data which was col -
lected that particular week. All sites were visited at least 
once within the week. The need to mount servers in these 
hard to reach areas that lack of essential utilities such as 
electricity at the health facilities was just not feasible.
As far as data backup at the central system is con -
cerned, the central system was set up to conduct daily 
backups scheduled to run at 3:00  pm during the day. 
A full backup of the database was automated to copy 
the database files to a network attached storage (NAS) 
device. Every morning, the master’s student checked 
that the previous backup was successful by verifying that 
a backup was performed comparing the file sizes of the 
current backup with any previous backups.
In an event that a backup failed, a manual backup 
was performed immediately and the backup issue was 
reported for troubleshooting. Additional manual back -
ups on the central system were done on a weekly basis 
by securely connecting to the server and then copying the 
Structured Query Language (.sql) dump to an external 
hard drive for safe keeping away from the main storage

Discussion
This quality improvement project in rural Malawi is the 
first to utilize mobile devices on ODK platform to cap -
ture patient-level data for disease surveillance at sub-dis -
trict level. The conditions of the location selected for this 
implementation project are comparable to other malaria 
endemic countries, and are characterized by being 
LMIC, dependent on subsistence farming, with reduced 
access to road networks, infrastructure, running water, 
electricity.
Information systems, particularly at point of care, need 
to be simple and sustainable and not overburden health 
delivery staff. This study demonstrated that HCWs were 
able to reliably record and transmit data through an elec -
tronic reporting platform in this scenario, EDC using 
ODK on tablet software. With the use of EDC, captur -
ing and incorporating of some essential parameters that 
had not been developed and incorporated in the paper-
based registers were done. Completeness and consist -
ency of data in EDC was markedly better compared to 
the poor levels observed using the paper-based system. 
This could be attributed to the fact that manual entry 
of the paper-based registers, may have resulted in some 
reports being lost in the process, mix-up of entries as 
data clerks are responsible for handling multiple regis -
ters or no entry at all into the database due to other prob -
lems such as lack of stationery. Similarly, use of multiple Page 8 of 11 Tizifa et al. Malar J          (2021) 20:203 
registers to capture a single entry could have contributed 
to mix-up of entries as a wrong result could be given to 
a patient. Having many forms and registers being han -
dled by a single HCW may contribute to having fatigue 
and loss of focus thereby resulting in having inaccurate 
data and illegible writings as seen in most of the health 
facilities. Furthermore, this can complicate the situation 
as it cannot be clearly established whether what has been 
reported reciprocates to what the HCW does.
This EDC method offers a better solution to the use of 
multiple registers by a single individual. Before data col -
lection when forms were being developed, sampling of 
multiple registers used in entering malaria data, such as 
the OPD, laboratory and anti-malarial registers was con -
ducted. These registers were adapted with a few addi -
tions and developed into the electronic format that was 
placed in the devices for data clerks to use. This resolved 
the problem of having data entry in multiple registers by 
a single individual thereby avoiding unnecessary errors. 
Similarly, this could also be adapted to incorporate other 
registers that are used at the health facilities such as the 
antenatal and immunization registers.
It could be argued that improving the current paper-
based systems could be more affordable and bring in 
better results. Successes on the improvement of existing 
paper-based systems for data collection have occurred in 
different areas within sub-Saharan Africa [27–30], and 
innovations included having simple registers and com -
bined primary care registers. Despite this, there are still 
existing challenges that are still being addressed in those 
setups, which within the current setup also apply. These 
include existence of inadequate human resource, space 
for storage and frequent trainings for HCW responsible 
for data management. Thus, paper-based form would 
currently be a challenge as a number of impending issues 
need to be addressed such as having adequate human 
resource, additional storage facilities, and transport 
issues where aggregated reports need to be sent to the 
district office for tallying and uploading into the HMIS. 
It would be easy to scale up the improved paper-based 
system as it will be just a replacement of the old registers 
with new ones.
Use of the EDC system in the current deployment 
eliminated the need for paper records by having all the 
required indicators pre-programmed into electronic 
forms and inserted into the ODK using Samsung tablet 
devices. It was easy for all HCWs to ensure that standard 
protocols are followed and the system itself was designed 
in a way as to not miss any field. This design facilitated 
complete records and proper storage. This system fur -
ther provided an opportunity for remote quality control, 
as the data once collected could then be transferred from 
the remote server where other checks could be done to ensure consistency and completeness. The need to have 
EDC would also assist in reducing the problem of stor -
age of records. In general, space that would be useful for 
service provision in rural health facilities could be turned 
into storage for filled up registers, so with EDC this prob -
lem could be overcome.
In this setting, that is malaria endemic, it has been 
shown that case registers were available but the data was 
mostly unreliable as it was incomplete, error-prone and 
experienced delays in transmission to the district site 
where all data for the district were compiled and aggre -
gated. This makes it possible for such registers to under-
represent the burden of disease within the community. 
Quality and timely data at district level is essential as it 
would help to identify areas with the highest burden so 
that proper intervention coverage, such as the use of 
ITNs or mass drug administration, can be implemented. 
It also helps to identify hotspots that are areas of high 
endemicity and are capable of causing an epidemic if not 
properly managed. Quality and timely data help to pri -
oritize the allocation of resources in areas that are heav -
ily burdened by the district in order to obtain adequate 
supplies of medicines, such as anti-malarials, good pub -
lic health practice in order to identify cases in the most 
remote areas in order to avoid mortality.
In the implementation effort reported here, EDC 
showed many attractive features and was highly regarded 
by HCWs in the field as a useful tool to increase their effi -
ciency, and by supervisors as a great resource for quality 
control. Despite the achievements brought through the 
introduction of EDC, challenges of this system were also 
observed. Firstly, this system is effective mostly at sites 
where there is a reliable source of power to charge the 
tablets. Some facilities however did not have electricity as 
a result managing the devices was somehow difficult and 
the team had to find other means to avoid them shutting 
down. This situation is more complex in hard to reach 
areas where personnel need to travel long distances to get 
to a point where they can have access to power and it is 
typical for most rural areas in LMIC. For a programme 
of this nature, access to power is very important for suc -
cessful implementation. Possibly, cheaper forms of power 
such as solar electricity could be the solution for rural 
areas in order to address such problems. These solar pan -
els have been successfully used elsewhere [31].
Another challenge raised was that devices are mostly 
prone to theft. There is a greater need to safeguard these 
devices otherwise implementation of the programme 
would not be a success once these devices have gone 
missing. Typically, there is need to find ways of securing 
them mostly when they are not in use with means of trac -
ing them. Since it was a pilot, one of the concerns that 
was also raised was the addition of workload as a result Page 9 of 11
 Tizifa et al. Malar J          (2021) 20:203 
 
of adding EDC together with the paper based system. 
HCWs had to switch between use of registers and EDC 
so that data was ably captured using both data capture 
methods. There is also the problem of high turnover at 
most government facilities so a concern was raised that 
there would be need for orientation for new staff who 
would be responsible for data entry. For a successful pro -
ject and sustainability of the implementation programme, 
there is need for continuous engagement and orientation 
of all stakeholders, which at times can prove to be costly 
[32].
Facilities also mentioned that they experienced chal -
lenges with airtime to send data to the server, they would 
rely on finding other means of transport to the DHO so 
that data reaches the server. Through this discovery, it 
enabled us to discuss with the teams involved on better 
ways of mitigating these problems. There is need to find 
the best ways possible for the data to reach the server. 
This could require investing into the provision of ade -
quate airtime so that data transmission should not be 
affected. As described by Proctor et  al., adoption of an 
intervention best resides from the perspective of the pro -
vider [32], in this case, engaging the stakeholders was of 
great significance to the solutions of the problem. Facili -
ties also were concerned that data being collected was 
not easy for them to access once sent to the DHO. This 
problem was due to the fact that access to the server was 
only limited to the administrator. It can be easily resolved 
by providing access to other service providers, such as 
the data clerks and medical assistants from the facilities 
to have access to the server’s URL.
In terms of the costs of implementing this EDC system, 
the start-up costs, which are mainly for software, form 
development, as well as the hardware need to be consid -
ered. In this case, since ODK collect is free and an open 
source software, the initial investment will be small. It is a 
software that is favoured in areas with poor internet con -
nectivity, such as the pilot area, since the entire process, 
from form creation to data download, can be completed 
offline. Open source software, such as ODK, is affordable 
and allows for adaptation and local use. The need for data 
cleaning is considerably reduced because EDC has in-
built cleaning rules. This saves time and costs by reducing 
the need for field verification, and manual data check -
ing and correcting. When it comes to the hardware, the 
startup costs will be high because devices such as android 
tablets will be needed for various health facilities. The 
android tablets used in the pilot were under $100 (US 
Dollars), and with advances in technology and availabil -
ity, prices are likely to continue to decline. While EDC 
has higher start-up costs than paper-based system in this 
case, there are no data entry, printing, or photocopying 
costs for EDC. However, EDC running costs required to sustain the system need to be taken into considera -
tion. As time progresses with the use of EDC, issues of 
wear and tear begin to surface. Situations may arise such 
as the need for replacement of damaged, lost, or stolen 
hardware (including tablets, chargers and other support -
ing equipment). Institutions and facilities must assess 
the EDC system on a regular basis in order to deter -
mine whether damaged equipment should be repaired 
or replaced entirely. This is very important because it 
will help to avoid hiccups in the data collection process. 
These costs must be properly determined and taken into 
account prior to a massive scale up, as this will assist the 
government or facilities in preparing. Other operating 
costs include managing internet or cellular connectivity, 
as well as ICT costs for managing an ever-growing data -
base and server capacity, which is a challenge in most 
LMIC. Cost aspects were however beyond the scope of 
this survey as it was formulated to come up with possible 
solutions of having better data quality in the four rural 
health facilities.
The outcome measurements of the project met the 
expectations to the stakeholders in terms of accuracy, 
completeness, timeliness and transmission for feedback 
and support of HCWs in a remote setting in Malawi. 
Implementation of a system such as EDC using ODK on 
a larger scale, such as a whole district level, is therefore 
warranted and needs to be implemented in Malawi. This 
could be a reliable indicator of the feasibility of the system 
in those that would be using it and can be a determining 
factor for the scalability of this innovation. Some recom -
mendations that were made included that refresher train -
ings should happen and that health facility in-charges 
should be involved when developing the ODK form to 
minimize errors. There is also need for proper planning 
for the project together with the district management 
team on how best EDC can be executed at a large scale. 
Since it is not yet adopted for use by the government at 
its facilities, the need of extra human resource such as 
additional data clerks to minimize the workload incurred 
with the introduction of EDC needs to be addressed. For 
proper continuity there is need for a proper timeframe to 
be put in place for the large-scale pilot, such as at district 
level, results need to be discussed and disseminated with 
all the key stakeholders, including policy makers. There 
is also need for availability of devices that are working 
properly so as to avoid disruptions in data collection.
Scaling up an intervention is a meticulous process that 
needs buy-in from implementers, so it is usually gradual 
and needs input from various stakeholders including 
policymakers. Based on previous experience with the use 
of EDC in the form of EMR for ART in tertiary hospitals 
across Malawi, at least two pilots had been conducted 
to determine the extent to which EMR is best adapted Page 10 of 11 Tizifa et al. Malar J          (2021) 20:203 
by practitioners [26]. Shortfalls of the new system were 
noted and documented by implementers and an inde -
pendent taskforce was set up to evaluate the implementa -
tion of EMR for ART [26]. It should be noted that there 
are contextual differences between using EMRs as an 
EDC method for capturing conditions like (HIV/AIDS) 
that require referral and specialized care at tertiary insti -
tutions, as was the case above, and using EDC with tablet 
software using the ODK method, as demonstrated in this 
pilot. Scalability to other sites would be slightly different 
than with the EMR system, as it would involve mostly 
facilities similar to the pilot facilities as well as different 
types of devices (tablets in this case compared to fixed 
touch screens as was the case with EMR) and equipment. 
Since this was a pilot that only assessed the quality of the 
data management systems within the four health centres, 
the intention of scaling up was not part of the agenda. 
However, with these findings, building on these results 
would be essential so as to see the outcomes of the scale 
up. The next steps would be to conduct a large-scale pilot 
at district level, involving all facilities including those that 
have better access to utilities, such as electricity, and are 
not in hard to reach areas.
Sustainability is a critical aspect in as far as a pro -
gramme’s lifecycle is concerned. By definition, sus -
tainability is defined as the extent to which a newly 
implemented programme or service is maintained or 
institutionalized within a service setting’s ongoing, sta -
ble operations [32]. In a situation where EDC with ODK 
is being implemented, just like any other programme, 
informing, educating and communicating (IEC) users 
about the objectives is very critical for creating and gain -
ing buy-in to the user’s vision of using it. There has to be 
consistent feedback between all stakeholders. At the end 
of the day, there has to be ownership of the whole system 
by the users since it is more effective compared to the 
previous system. In this setting, where EDC has not been 
used before it is necessary to implement this on a small 
scale first, e.g. a district-level trial for a specific period 
of time. Its successes and challenges need to be noted in 
order to get the users’ perspective. If perceived as effec -
tive by the users, the workload must be eased otherwise 
early system glitches may compromise perceptions of 
reliability, ultimately undermining user buy-in.
Conclusion
This work demonstrates that using mobile technologies, 
such as EDC using the ODK platform in the capture and 
reporting of health facility data in remote locations of 
LMIC provides timely, complete and high quality data for 
malaria and other common conditions. Quality, complete 
and timely data collection by health workers in a remote 
setting in Malawi is achievable and such data can be transmitted, aggregated and used by HCWs and the dis -
trict to improve their service delivery. Investment in this 
system would benefit the health care system as witnessed 
from the results. The technology uses cheap software 
and with advances in technology the probability of hav -
ing cheaper devices with time still exists. However, there 
is need to build up on the results through piloting on a 
large scale involving multiple sites at district level and to 
determine the cost effectiveness due to the infrastructure 
and other health system needs in similar settings. This 
will assist in providing further evidence on adaptability 
by users and possibly sustainability.
