During the Ebola Crisis from 2014-2015, insufficient digital 
infrastructure in Liberia inhibited a rapid and resilient response — to devastating effects. 
Poor access to internet meant the spread of outbreaks could not be effectively monitored. Healthcare workers and vulnerable communities lacked information to contain the disease. In the end, Liberia lost nearly 5,000 lives to Ebola, including 8% of its doctors, nurses, and midwives. The crisis cost the nation’s economy ~USD 300 million.
In the wake of Ebola, USAID launched a series of investments to improve internet 
connectivity. In partnership with CSquared (a consortium including Google, Mitsui, and the IFC), USAID has invested in 200 kilometers of middle mile fiber optic cable to create a shared network backbone in Monrovia. 
USAID hopes that expanded access to affordable, high quality internet will spur material 
impacts on economic, health, and learning outcomes – ultimately leading to greater self-reliance in Liberia.
This document explores the current state of connectivity and digital infrastructure in 
Liberia’s healthcare and education systems – and aspirations for the future. This will provide a baseline to evaluate the impact of USAID’s investment over the coming years. Three institutions were selected as case studies: ELWA Hospital, Redemption Hospital, and the University of Liberia, Fendall Campus.
This is just one part of a comprehensive five-year Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning 
(MEL) journey USAID has embarked on in parallel with the connectivity investment. This learning effort will allow USAID to track the impact of its investments, make data-driven programmatic adjustments, and ultimately share the findings to the broader USAID and external development community.THE CONTEXT

Digital infrastructure is critical to materially improving 
healthcare and education outcomes in Liberia — and in so doing, driving greater self-reliance. 
Healthcare: Connected hospitals and clinics can more quickly identify and transmit the early signs of disease outbreak – and rapidly contain it.
1  And access to online medical information 
(diagnostics, treatments, etc.) allows doctors to provide higher quality ongoing patient care. This leads to healthier, and more economically productive, Liberians and reduces strain on government systems. (See Figure 1)
Education: Connectivity gives faculty access to critical research and teaching materials. 
Students have access to information to complete core coursework, augment in-class learning, and ultimately develop the capacity for self-learning. This too enhances economic growth and resilience. Students are better able to find meaningful employment in critical sectors (e.g., IT, healthcare, and education) and sustain new enterprises. Faculty can better contribute to the broader policy dialogue. Eventually, the university can become an incubator for technology and innovation – within Liberia, for Liberia. (See Figure 2)
Yet today internet connectivity is extremely poor across the board – when it exists at all. 
ELWA Hospital pays $100 per month for 120 GB of data (the highest Orange will allow) – for the 
entire hospital; the data is typically exhausted within the first 1-2 weeks. Redemption hospital SUMMARY INSIGHTS
1 During the Ebola Crisis, countries like Nigeria and Senegal were able to catalyze mobile technology to track transmission of the disease and issue public warnings via SMS, leading to rapid containment; 8 individuals died in Nigeria, while no one died in Senegal.  “Use of Technology in the Ebola Response in West Africa,” USAID Technical Brief, November 2014.
INSIGHTSSUMMARY6
currently has no internet connectivity at the institutional level. Meanwhile, the University of Liberia, 
Fendall Campus has connectivity in just one of its five main academic buildings – but it is costly ($4,200/
month for 12 Mbps), highly unreliable (off 2 days/week on average), and bandwidth is severely constrained (a standard web-page can take 5-10 min. to load). 
This is not due to lack of demand – Liberians 
want the internet. Senior leadership, 
administrative staff, doctors, faculty, and 
students alike expressed not just a desire – but a deep need – for affordable, reliable, high quality internet. 
As a result, individuals are paying for mobile 
data on their own personal devices – often 
at significant personal cost. Doctors pay $30/month on average for mobile data to access apps like UpToDate and Medscape which provide 
end-to-end patient care information. Faculty are 
paying $10-50/month (or up to 5% of salary) just to conduct the very basic academic activities. Students 
pay anywhere from $5 to $20/month, depending on their personal financial situation – often having to make tradeoffs between whether to take the bus to campus or buy a scratch card for more data. SUMMARY INSIGHTS
2 Estimates based on following assumptions: Doctors – 300 physicians in Liberia paying average of ~$30/month (N=7); Faculty - ~1.4K faculty at University of Liberia, also paying an average of ~$30/month (N=12); Student - ~20K students at University of Liberia, paying an average of $15/month (N=16).
Liberia’s doctors pay an 
estimated ~$100K a  
year for mobile data.  
University of Liberia 
faculty pay ~$500K  
a year, while students 
pay ~$3.5M.2 “We get really excited when we hear 
USAID is investing in internet. There is

Each institution had bold aspirations for what it will do 
with improved internet connectivity – and supporting 
digital infrastructure. 
University of Liberia: 
• Digitized academic and student support 
services – end-to-end digitization of academic and administrative processes (admissions, course registration, tuition/billing, etc.).
• Digital integration in core coursework and 
research– integration of technology to facilitate core 
course development, course completion, and research. 
• Access to ancillary support and online learning –
online video content, tutorials, etc. to support in-class 
learning, as well as online courses (e.g., via YALI
3 , 
Coursera, EdX).
• International academic collaboration – virtual 
access to international faculty, and students, to share research and broaden networks.
• Technology-driven learning innovations – Innovative 
blended learning approaches (e.g., flipped classrooms) to improve student learning outcomes.
• Access to extracurricular and post-graduation 
opportunities – access to business plan competitions, graduate school preparation information, and employment opportunities.

be able to do all the activities they already 
do online today – faster, reliably, and at less 
personal cost. Moreover, they will be able to pursue many adjacent activities that do not require significant additional investments 
in infrastructure, but do require high quality 
(high speed, low latency) internet – like 
streaming educational video content and video-conferencing with international partners. 
However, additional investments in critical 
enablers will be required to reach the full 
potential of the investment in connectivity. 
And some impacts may be beyond the scope of this initial investment – e.g., increasing healthcare and education connectivity in rural 
Liberia. 
• Sustaine d IT Capacity  – All institutions 
lacked sufficient, local, knowledgeable 
IT staff. For example, ELWA has just one full-time IT person – operating on a wholly volunteer basis. 
• A dditional Hardware and Software 
– Hardware and software needs vary by institution, though all require some incremental investment. Redemption especially will require investment as very little infrastructure exists today (est. $40K on-time investment). 
• Digital Liter acy – ELWA and Redemption need 
basic computer skills training for staff, before they can transition to digitized record-keeping. Basic computer skills are relatively strong at the University of Liberia, and will ramp up quickly with the right support, but some faculty members and staff will still require training. Incoming freshman may also benefit from literacy training. 
• Imp lementation Support  – Longer term 
support will be needed to transition fully to an electronic medical records system (EMR) and to digitize key university processes (e.g., tuition/billing, finance, HR). (Est. ~$1M for ~24 months of comprehensive rollout support)
• R eliable Electricity  – Digital infrastructure 
is maximally effective when it can be reliably 
powered. Yet today all institutions use diesel 
generators – and suffer from high costs and 
frequent outages.
“We hope that with 
better technology, 
we are better able 
to train Liberian 
medical students. 
And that one day we 
can drive medical 
innovation right 
here – to the benefit 
of Liberia and even 
of West Africans 
more broadly.”
HOSPITAL DIRECTOR  
ELWA HOSPITAL10 SUMMARY INSIGHTS
Therefore USAID, other development actors, as well as government and the private sector, can 
continue to play an important role. Near term, the highest value areas for investment are in IT capacity, hardware / software, and digital literacy training – as costs are low, and impact immediate. Electricity reliability, while fundamental, is a much broader issue affecting Liberia and will require separate evaluation and intervention development. 
This is just the first step in a multi-year journey. But the promise of connectivity is clear. And healthcare and education institutions share the vision for a more connected – and resilient – Liberia.

The Promise of Connectivity for Healthcare in Liberia:  
Spotlight on ELWA and Redemption Hospitals
Even prior to the Ebola Crisis, Liberia’s healthcare system was among the weakest in the world. 
Fifteen years of civil war wrought damage on much of the physical infrastructure – and decimated the pipeline for medical professionals. Today there is just one doctor per 15,000 individuals (versus 1:1,000 as prescribed by the WHO).  As a result, Liberia relies heavily on foreign physician support. 
The lack of digital infrastructure exacerbates an already vulnerable healthcare system. Weak 
internet connectivity limits access to important medical information, creates inefficiencies in critical processes like medical records-keeping (all paper-based today), and inhibits real-time disease surveillance.  Significant medical staff time is diverted from patient care. Patient wait-times are long (a typical outpatient visit can last the entire day). And continuity of patient care is poor as medical records are often missing.  Paper-based record-keeping also inhibits timely spotting of disease outbreaks. 
To get a deeper perspective of the current state of connectivity and digital infrastructure – and 
understand aspirations for the future – two of Monrovia’s largest teaching hospitals were profiled:
ELWA Hospital: Eternal Love Winning Africa (ELWA) is a Christian Mission-based hospital that was 
established in 1965 at the site of West Africa’s first Christian radio station. It remained open throughout most of Liberia’s civil wars and was a primary responder during Ebola – treating over 750 patients.  In November, 2016, ELWA completed construction on a new USD 5 million, 85-bed hospital facility. 
Redemption Hospital: Redemption Hospital, a government-funded hospital, was founded in 1982 
following Liberia’s military coup to provide free care to Monrovians. The hospital was one of the hardest hit during the Ebola Crisis, losing 12 doctors and nurses and eventually being forced to close operations. With international donor support, Redemption reopened in January 2015. Plans are in place for Redemption to relocate to a larger (300-bed) and more modern space by 2020.

The Current State of Connectivity and Digital Infrastructure
\
Historically ELWA had unlimited, high quality access 
– for free. However, going forward internet will almost certainly be more restricted, and higher cost. In a non-monetary exchange, ELWA provided Cellcom (later acquired by Orange) access to its radio tower to install its antenna; in return, ELWA received direct line access for free. However, in ~March 2018 Orange unexpectedly revoked ELWA’s free access; a new contract is still under negotiation. In the meantime, ELWA is paying month-to-month for 120 GB, the most Orange will allow – but it is insufficient to meet ELWA’s needs. In the first month on this package, hospital staff exhausted the data within the first two weeks. 
After Ebola, the International Rescue Committee 
(IRC) funded Redemption’s internet connectivity. But Redemption was unable to continue paying when the program ended in 2017. Even with Internet connectivity, the bandwidth could not accommodate hospital operations. There were typically 100 users connected at any given time. Speed was sufficient to accommodate video conferencing or meetings with the hospital’s Board of Directors – but only if the number connected was tightly controlled.

Hardware and software systems are weak across both 
hospitals – but especially at Redemption. The new ELWA 
facility is equipped with robust network infrastructure and two backup servers; other hardware and software systems are limited – e.g., there are only 11 desktop computers. 
Redemption, which is twice as large as ELWA, also only has 
11 desktop computers (most of which are outdated) and no 
servers. Most of the network infrastructure was destroyed during sanitization efforts post-Ebola.
IT capacity is also extremely limited. Today ELWA has no 
formal IT allocation in its operating budget; there is just one 
full-time staff member – a Swiss expat there for two years on 
a wholly volunteer basis. Redemption also has just one full-time (though paid) IT staff member.

Digital Usage and Implications for Healthcare Outcomes in Liberia
Doctors at both ELWA and Redemption have established internet usages for medical care. When 
internet was available, doctors used it regularly (3-4 hours/day) on their personal mobile devices for: 
• End-to -end patient care: Mobile apps like UpToDate and Medscape used to access diagnostic 
information, treatment options, and medication dosages and interactions. 
• Me dical research:  Internet used to access online academic journals (e.g., New England Journal of 
Medicine) and e-books across a range of medical topics.  
• T raining and teaching:  Internet used to download books, notes, and lesson materials to use with 
medical students. And even videos of medical procedures.
• Communications:  Primarily intra-hospital communications. But some communication with external 
hospitals – e.g., sharing X-rays via email with JFK hospital. 
Nurses also use their mobile devices for patient care – though less frequently than doctors (e.g., 3-4 times / day). They typically use general search (i.e., google) rather than specific applications. SPOTLIGHT ON ELWA AND REDEMPTION HOSPITALS
“I recently saw a patient 
presenting symptoms for Acute 
cutaneous lupus erythematosus. 
I used the Medscape app to 
compare the patient’s lesions to 
photos to diagnose the condition 
and to assess the likelihood of 
relationship to systemic disease.” 
ER DOCTOR, ELWA
“We do not have many doctors. Sometimes the doctor will check  
the patient and tell me the diagnostic result and expect me to take 
care of the patient, but I do not always know how to provide care.  
Often, I get cases I have never dealt with before so I search on 
Google: Symptoms, causes and treatment of respiratory failure? 
Or what do if the chronic pain of patient with disease X gets worse?”
NURSE, REDEMPTION HOSPITAL22
However, now that connectivity has lapsed, 
medical staff must pay out of pocket for 
mobile data – and many go without. Most doctors at ELWA pay $20-$80/month out of pocket to use their mobile device for patient 
care. At Redemption, however, many have 
stopped using internet entirely at work.
More broadly, the lack of digital 
infrastructure means that today all medical record-keeping at both ELWA and 
Redemption is paper-based. 
This includes patient registration, all doctor and 
nurse documentation, lab/imaging referrals and results, and pharmacy referrals. At ELWA, the process is somewhat streamlined as all records 
are kept in a single patient file and an excel 
database linking patient names to ID numbers 
exists in case a patient forgets his number. However, at Redemption, even patient names and numbers are recorded on paper – meaning if a number is forgotten, a new ID must usually be created. And there are no physical files – patient forms are stored loosely.
Paper-based records have direct negative 
impacts on patient continuity – and speed – of care. The majority of returning patients do not remember their patient IDs. As a result, it can take significant time to find the patient’s file – if it can be found at all. This can have wide-ranging consequences – e.g., lacking critical information regarding medical allergies or complication risks.SPOTLIGHT ON ELWA AND REDEMPTION HOSPITALS
“When there was Internet in 
the hospital, I could look up 
information online at any 
time. Now, I make decisions 
on the go and when I go 
home, I do more research to 
verify whether the medicine 
and dosage I prescribed to 
a patient were right. Once 
I had to call the nurse and 
ask her to reduce the dosage 
after I went home and did 
some research online and 
realized that the dosage I 
prescribed was incorrect.” 
DOCTOR  
REDEMPTION HOSPITAL
“I’ve spent hours trying to track down 
patient files. Last week I had a patient 
in who had been in just the week 
before. There had been complications 
with his procedure. I wanted to  
look at the detailed documentation 
but the file was missing. It didn’t turn 
up for several hours and the patient 
just had to wait in the meantime 
because I couldn’t really proceed 
without the information.”
ER DOCTOR, ELWA“There’s people 
registered about  
five places here.” 
RECORD ROOM STAFF  
REDEMPTION HOSPITAL24
Paper-based processes create significant inefficiencies throughout the system – which reduces staff 
time spent on care, as well as potential patient throughput. Doctors and nurses remarked that simply shuttling papers between departments (e.g., to and from the lab) takes significant time. If a patient is referred to another hospital, a nurse accompanies the patient to ensure the referral is delivered. 
Inefficient processes increase patient wait times and can lead to higher direct cost to the patient. 
The average non-admitted patient at ELWA arrives in the morning between 8-8:30am and will not depart until the end of the day. When records cannot be found, patients often must repeat labs or imaging. This is both a negative patient experience – and economically disruptive. 
Finally, manual reporting / statistics makes retrospective medical research laborious – and proactive 
identification of trends and potential disease outbreaks nearly impossible. For example, each month the hospitals are required to report on a range of statistics (e.g., patient volumes, births, disease area counts, mortality counts and causes, etc.) to the Ministry of Health. It takes 7 days each month for the Medical Records Director at both hospitals to receive inputs and compile the report by hand. SPOTLIGHT ON ELWA AND REDEMPTION HOSPITALS
“Because records are so often missing, or take so long to find, I’ve started 
writing out important dosage information on a sheet of paper that I give to 
patients and tell them to hold onto it in case they need to come back.” 
PEACECORPS DOCTOR, REDEMPTION HOSPITALWaiting at ELWA“If we want to 
compare data 
over time, it is 
manual and 
takes several

be very hard 
to spot an 
emerging 
trend until 
well after it

Aspirations for the Future
At the most basic level, ELWA and Redemption hope to resume typical internet activities in place 
prior to losing access – and to amplify (e.g., increased virtual interactions with international experts).
In the near term, ELWA has plans to begin digitizing certain discrete hospital functions and processes. 
Redemption also has plans to digitize more of the patient-intake 
process and monthly data analysis. Redemption would like to move to a similar model as ELWA – where patient names and IDs are recorded in MSFT Access, facilitating record finding when a patient forgets his number. However, the necessary funding ($15K) has been slow to arrive. Given budget constraints and the anticipated move to a new facility in the next 12-18 months, additional infrastructure investments are largely on hold. 
Over the medium term, both hospitals have bold aspirations for 
connectivity – and the impact it can have on improving healthcare outcomes. Though additional infrastructure will be needed. 
• Electronic Medical Records – Eventually both hospitals want 
to digitize all hospital processes (patient registration, medical documentation, and referrals) to improve continuity of care, decrease time spent on non-medically important activities, and facilitate reporting /analysis.
• Electronic Billing – ELWA also wants to integrate patient 
invoicing with the EMR system to streamline the process and increase accuracy.
• Rapid Epidemic Surveillance and Response – With digital 
records in place, ELWA and Redemption envision being able to analyze aggregate data in near real-time to proactively identify trends in disease areas and potential outbreaks. This will facilitate rapid containment.
• Virtual International Medical Collaboration – Doctors envision 
systematized virtual interactions (e.g., video-conferencing) for consultation, remote diagnosis, and remote / online training of local Liberian medical students to cost-effectively accelerate medical advancement. SPOTLIGHT ON ELWA AND REDEMPTION HOSPITALS

• Intra-Liberian Telemedicine – Doctors also envision being better connected to other hospitals and 
clinics in Monrovia (to streamline medical care and collaboration) – and eventually to the broader 
rural healthcare ecosystem. For example, they hope to use mobile technology to facilitate diagnosis and consultation for patients at rural clinics via web-cams or electronic sharing of photos, labs, and imaging results.
Longer term, senior hospital leadership envision a robust, connected Liberian ecosystem capable of 
meeting the country’s medical needs internally. Hospital leaders hope that technology will eventually 
facilitate better learning opportunities for medical students – creating a more robust pipeline for Liberian-based physicians and reducing reliance on foreign support. But more than that, they envision being able to advance Liberian-specific medical research and innovation – and to not only learn from, but give back 
to, the international medical community.

Requirements to Reach Aspirations
While demand is there, parallel investments will be required to reach full intended impact.  Additional 
one-time support required to meet aspirations ranges from ~$1.3-$1.7M per hospital. 
• Sustaine d IT Capacity: Historically IT investments have been made by external development actors 
who stand up the software / hardware, provide basic training, and then depart. When the software 
/ hardware has issues, local IT staff often lack the requisite knowledge to fix it – at times rendering the original investment useless. Investment in training local Liberian IT staff is therefore required for connectivity and future IT investments to be successful.
• Digital Liter acy Training: Currently digital literacy levels vary widely across hospital staff – with 
senior leadership and doctors generally proficient, but many administrative staff and nurses unable to use basic software applications. Basic computer skills training is therefore required. [insert digital literacy chart]
• Imp lementation Support: Beyond basic levels of digital literacy, staff members must be trained 
to use new technologies – which requires personnel support and time. Pilots of the software / hardware must be conducted. Changes must be made to the software / hardware and accompanying processes. And all of this must be done while continuing to run the hospital. IT noted an HIS could take 18-24 months to effectively roll out. 
• A dditional Hardware and Software:  Additional investments will be necessary, though exact needs 
will vary by institution and stage of rollout. 
• R eliable Electricity:  Both hospitals run on generators. Costs are high and outages frequent. For the 
longer term success of digital applications, especially those critical to core hospital processes (e.g., EMR), more affordable reliable electricity required.  
Some aspirations remain beyond the reach of our initial investment. In particular, connecting Monrovian hospitals with the broader rural Liberian ecosystem will require internet connectivity in rural Liberia. This in turn will likely require additional investments in infrastructure – whether by extending the fiber optic network or increasing cell tower density.SPOTLIGHT ON ELWA AND REDEMPTION HOSPITALS

$142,000 USD IT budgetThe Context
The education system in Liberia across all levels is among the weakest in the world. After decades of 
poverty and conflict, Liberia has the second highest out-of-school rates in Africa, following South Sudan. Government expenditure on education continues to lag the Sub-Saharan African average (3% of GDP v. 8%). Literacy levels among both youth and adults are dismally low (55% of 15-24 year-olds are literate).
[insert national statistics on education chart]
The lack of sufficient digital infrastructure exacerbates an already struggling higher education 
system. Weak internet connectivity disrupts basic academic pursuits. Faculty have difficulty conducting research and accessing teaching materials. Students cannot access information to complete core coursework – or online tutorial support to augment in-class learning. Laborious paper-based administrative processes (admissions, course registration, tuition/billing, etc.) create significant inefficiencies and reduce time (and funds) available for higher value academic and employment pursuits. 
This leads to weaker educational outcomes 
and inhibits economic development. Both incoming and graduating students often have low levels of digital literacy. They may struggle to find meaningful employment opportunities – and are ill-equipped for self-directed ongoing training and development.  The ecosystem for new businesses is weaker as a result (reducing secondary employment opportunities) and chronic talent shortages exist in critical sectors like ICT, healthcare, and education.
To develop a deeper perspective on the 
current state of connectivity in higher education, we profiled the University of Liberia, Fendall Campus. The University of Liberia is the largest tertiary institution in the country, with ~19K admitted students (~10-12K actively enrolled). Fendall Campus is situated ~1 hour outside Monrovia and houses the University’s senior leadership and undergraduate programs. There are five academic buildings located on the site: the main academic building, the Engineering College, the Science College, the College of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Teaching College.

The Current State of Connectivity and Digital Infrastructure
Only one of the five buildings on Fendall’s campus is connected today via Libtelco – however, the 
connection is expensive and highly unreliable. Today Fendall pays $4.2K per month for 12 Mbps across Fendall and Capitol Hill – a significant portion of the annual IT budget (~$140K). The internet is down on average 2-3 days/week. As of July, it had been down continuously for a month due to a broken cable.  
As a result, the entire academic building is borrowing internet intended exclusively for the TDEL lab. 
The Trustees of Donations for Education in Liberia (TDEL) recently donated ~75 computers to the main campus library (60 for students; 15 for faculty). As part of the program, TDEL is also currently paying for a separate mobile internet package via Lonestar. Yet because Libtelco internet is down, Lonestar bandwidth is being diverted to serve the needs of the entire academic building (admin staff, faculty, etc.). As a result, observed speeds in the lab are extremely slow.
“We were supposed to have 
sufficient bandwidth / speed for 
typical student internet usage. 
But with the entire building 
piggybacking off our internet, 
the speeds are very slow. It can 
take 10 minutes for a simple 
text page to load. Videos often 
don’t load at all.”

The Engineering College had internet connectivity for several years as part of USAID’s EHELD 
program. However, internet connectivity lapsed when the program ended. As part of the Excellence 
in Higher Education for Liberian Development (EHELD) program from 2011-2017, USAID supported the buildout of digital infrastructure – and paid for internet – at the Engineering College. However, the college has been disconnected since the program ended in mid-2017 due to insufficient funds.  
As a result, personal usage of broadband modems and mobile hotspots is widespread. The University 
covers supplemental internet for some senior staff members, but most everyone else pays out of pocket – 
typically at significant personal cost. For example, students pay almost as much on  
internet as they do on tuition. Speeds are typically slow during the day given high mobile utilization.
Minimal additional investment in network infrastructure 
is required to set up connectivity across campuses – though financing has been slow. The head of IT estimates that a one-time investment of $10-$15K (on radios, switches, wireless routers, and networking cables) would be sufficient to distribute internet across campus. He hopes to secure financing during the next budget cycle underway now. Once the infrastructure is in place, IT can test whether the current 12 Mbps of bandwidth will suffice.
Other hardware infrastructure – and needs – vary 
widely by college. The Engineering College now has over ~120 desktop computers across 4 labs; there are also ~15 desktops and ~50 tablets in the engineering library. In the main academic building, the TDEL library has ~75 connected computers. Existing hardware, and supporting infrastructure (outlets, HVAC, etc.) is limited at the other colleges. 
Sufficient, well-skilled IT capacity is also a constraint – 
though is not currently the bottleneck. Currently there is one, full-time IT manager with years of international experience and expertise in networks. He is training five more junior IT staff. There is also one full-time library staff member responsible for digitizing library processes. 
“It gets a little better 
after 5pm when the 
power goes off in the 
main building and 
people go home. It 
really gets fast at 
3am, right when the 
power goes off in 
the dorm. So you sit 
there and do your 
homework in the 
dark. You get so 
excited because the 
internet is actually 
working, but it’s a 
trap – because then 
you’re tired the 
next day in class.”

Digital Usage and Implications for Education Outcomes in Liberia
Usage of the internet across an array of administrative and academic activities, across multiple 
stakeholders, is already well-established.
Broader University Ecosystem
• eRegistration: Historically, all course registration and academic documentation was paper-based. 
Students would queue for hours, over multiple days to register for courses – often missing class time. 
The University is currently in the process of piloting a partial online registration program, funded by the Government of Liberia. If the pilot is successful, full online registration will be launched next year (though if institutional internet is not improved – this will also require students to pay for internet out of pocket, just to register).
• Library System: During Liberia’s civil wars, many of its libraries 
were looted and much physical documentation was destroyed. To accelerate content build-out, the library has purchased subscriptions for several e-Library systems. While faster and cheaper than physical books, internet is required.
• Communication: Faculty, administrative staff, and students use 
the internet frequently for intra-university communications, as well as communications with external partners and universities.
 “With no 
internet, hiring 
new IT staff is 
not a priority. 
But it will 
be once we 
start building 
out more  
infrastructure.”

Faculty / Academic Staff
• Academic Research: Faculty rely heavily on international academic research today, though 
production of original research is limited given lack of internet access (and broader resource 
limitations).  
• Course Development and Pedagogy: Faculty members frequently use the internet to access lesson 
planning materials – as well as content to share with the students both in-/out- of the classroom. For 
example, faculty download videos to use in the classroom to bring a topic to life. In a lab-course at 
the College of Engineering, faculty download data sheets with parameters for different components – so students have the necessary information to begin building and testing circuit designs. 
“We have hundreds of components. But we can’t use them because we need the 
internet to download the datasheets with their parameters. Without that, we don’t 
know their functions. So faculty will print datasheets for some of them before class.” 
PROFESSOR, DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS, COLLEGE OF SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
UNIVERSITY OF LIBERIA FENDALL CAMPUS43
Students
• Core classwork: Though varying by college (and 
by faculty member), most students use the internet 
frequently to complete core classwork. At the most basic, assignments are often distributed (and turned 
in) by email. Students also conduct research for 
assignments online.
• Additional tutorial support: Students also use the 
internet to get additional support to augment in-class 
learning. For example, several students mentioned they 
learn better visually – and so will often access videos 
(via YouTube or Khan Academy) that help illustrate 
concepts. They also reach out to international students for virtual academic support. 
• General Research: In addition to research for 
completing specific class assignments, some (though 
far fewer, given the high cost of internet) use the 
internet to research general topics of interest. 
• Online courses / certifications: Students complete 
online courses offered by a range of providers – Coursera, EdX, and the Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI). Often students will look to these sites to take courses in topics not covered in their program of focus / major.
• Graduate school / employment info: Students also 
mentioned using the internet to access information about international graduate schools (e.g., admission requirements, TOEFL/GRE preparation, etc.).
“Internet is 
expensive but we 
do have professors 
who send us 
assignments by 
email. I will turn 
on my hotspot 
to download the 
assignment. But 
then I turn it off 
quickly – and don’t 
turn it back on until 
I need to email the 
assignment back.” 
4TH YEAR HONORS STUDENT  
COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE & FORESTRY
“I have a personal modem, and I keep it 
on pretty much all day. I research things 
for class. But just as often I do research 
on things that I just find interesting.”
4TH YEAR STUDENT, COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING
UNIVERSITY OF LIBERIA FENDALL CAMPUS44
The Engineering College shows how quickly digital uptake can evolve, when internet is in place.  
During the EHELD program, faculty quickly transitioned to using the internet for almost all exchange of 
class-related materials – and still do so today, despite the end in institutional internet access. Engineering students also had more established and varying internet usage. This differs from other Colleges where some, but generally few, faculty members and students are exchanging information virtually. 
Yet usage of the computer labs has vastly diminished since connectivity lapsed. The labs are still 
used for some classes that use primarily on-premise software (e.g., Auto-cad), but many labs require 
internet access for most effective use (e.g., to download component data sheets). In the library, the ~50 tablets sit unplugged, completely unused – as they require the internet to access e-books and e-journals. 
Moreover, lack of access can amplify income disparities and creates unfortunate tradeoffs. A few 
students can pay for consistent internet access. Most meter their usage closely – only using it when 
necessary for assignments. Students must sometimes decide whether to buy a bus ticket to get to 
campus or a new scratch card for additional data to complete assignments. 
Lack of access is especially problematic when processes are designed around connectivity. For 
example, in a recent engineering exam, the professor distributed the exam by email and asked students to submit it, by email, at a certain time. All the students got out their personal devices to download the exam – except one, who did not have any data. Eventually another student noticed and shared her personal hotspot, but the student was unable to complete and submit the exam in time. 
Many students have weak digital literacy – certainly incoming, but 
often outgoing as well – as a result. While students are extremely keen to learn digital tools – the lack of consistent, affordable, high quality internet access limits what they can do. Some graduate lacking basic skills – e.g., performing an effective internet search or finding and opening a word document. Many never learn more complicated skills like conducting in-depth scholarly research. 
Many university processes are paper-based, time-consuming, 
ineffective for decision-making, and ultimately distracting from higher value academic pursuits. Admissions, finance, and HR are all paper-based today. Reconciling student tuition payments can take the better part of the semester. Staff member pay checks are frequently delayed. And as the CFO noted, it is extremely difficult to make well-informed, data-based, timely strategic decisions under the current system.
“I had to give a talk on 
gender rights at school. 
So I took an online 
course through YALI 
first to prepare for it. 
I like online courses 
because I can study 
additional topics that 
we don’t normally cover 
in engineering classes.”

Aspirations for the Future
University leadership has broad aspirations for internet on campus. The University is currently 
searching for a Chief Information Officer (CIO) to direct digital strategy – a testament to its commitment to improving digital infrastructure on campus.
• Connect all colleges at Fendall to main network. The most pertinent near-term goal is to get the 
other colleges at Fendall connected to the main network (and to test whether 12 Mbps is sufficient bandwidth). To start, the University wants to ensure the existing computer labs have sufficient connectivity. But eventually they imagine having high speed public WiFi available throughout the campus. 
• Build out labs / libraries in every school. Over the near-to-medium term, leadership hopes to 
get two well-functioning, connected computer labs established at each of the colleges at Fendall (today only the Engineering college has a well-established lab system). One computer lab would be designated for classroom usage and the second would be for general research purposes – and would be equipped with digital library software. Eventually, the library system also hopes to digitize all existing paper materials – some of which can only be found in Liberia. 
• Digitize as many processes as possible. Once e-Registration has been rolled out, the next highest 
priority is integrating registration with online payments. This will significantly cut down on paperwork and improve financial decision-making. Eventually, the university also aims to move all course materials, communications, and grades online as well.
“Some of the books you see 
on the shelf, you can’t find 
anywhere else in the world. 
We have legal documents from 
the time of slavery in the US. 
There was a famous court case 
and the lawyer was Liberian. 
Digitizing and publishing 
documents like these will  
help us share our story.” 
DEAN, UNIVERSITY OF LIBERIA LIBRARIESUNIVERSITY OF LIBERIA FENDALL CAMPUS46
For students and faculty, access to internet is largely about being able to do what they already 
do today – but more effectively and affordably. This includes digital integration in core coursework 
and research; access to ancillary support and online learning; international academic collaboration; experimentation with technology-driven learning innovations (e.g., flipped classrooms); and access to extracurricular and post-graduation opportunities. 
Longer term, university leadership aspires to build a robust university ecosystem which catalyzes 
broader economic and policy gains in Libera. Leadership envisions producing students who are not 
only equipped to compete internationally, but who will become the next generation of Liberian leaders. They envision the university as a catalyst for Liberian-specific research which can support policy dialogue, advance innovation in critical sectors like healthcare and IT, and create new entrepreneurial and 
commercialization opportunities.
“My dream is that we will produce 
students with the necessary  
skills to go into the market and 
change the country.”
DIRECTOR, LUX-IN-TENEBRIS 
SCHOLARS PROGRAM
“With better internet connectivity, we will not only 
access research materials online, but we will also  
be able to contribute to the research out there.  We can publish results from experiments we run here and papers our faculty members work on.” 
PROFESSOR, DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS, COLLEGE OF SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY UNIVERSITY OF LIBERIA FENDALL CAMPUS47
Requirements to Reach Aspiration
There is much excitement and momentum around the 
promise of connectivity. But additional investments will be required to fully realize the university’s aspirations. 
• Funding: Funding is a major constraint given the 
bandwidth needed to effectively sustain university operations given the current cost of internet. Even once CSquared is rolled out, subsidies may be required short term to support the University’s ongoing access – until costs have declined enough that the University can cover internet out of its annual operating budget. 
• Hardware / Software: ~$50K investments in 
computers, networking equipment (e.g., switches, routers, etc.) will be required at each college except the College of Engineering (~$150K in total).  
• Physical Infrastructure: The College of 
Science, the College of Agriculture, and the Teaching College will also need investments in the buildings themselves – so that they can support digital infrastructure (e.g., HVAC, plumbing, electricity outlets in every room, etc.).
• Digital literacy: Some digital literacy 
classes are already under way for University staff members. As infrastructure is built out, additional training is likely needed. There is also the opportunity to intervene earlier and more explicitly with students – e.g., by requiring all incoming freshman to take a course in basic computing skills.
• IT Capacity: Additional trained staff 
members will be needed as additional infrastructure is rolled out (estimated 1-3 FTEs per college; ~12 in total).
• Reliable Electricity: The University 
runs on diesel generators which are costly. As such, electricity turns off at 5pm in the main academic buildings and 3am in the dormitories. This severely constrains the opportunity to use the digital infrastructure that is already in place – and longer term must be addressed to realize the full impact of additional IT investments.

“There has to be a plan from the beginning for sustainability. We have 10 
computers in the Science College that we cannot currently use because 
they run on a shared server, and the server broke, and the original 
individuals who installed it are no longer here. And it would cost more to 
send it in for repair than to get a new one”
