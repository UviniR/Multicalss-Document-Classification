i Summary  
The Emissions Trading Scheme pilot project for particulate matter is designing, 
implementing, and evaluating an innovative approach to pollution in India. As a 
regulatory instrument, emissions trading has the potential to eliminate the trade- off 
between environmental quality and growt h by improving air quality through a mechanism 
that is transparent, predictable, and costs firms  less to comply. A critical intermediate 
stage of this project involves the rollout of Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems to 
monitor particulate matter emi ssions at the stack, which greatly improves the information 
and ability of regulators to monitor firms , allowing regulatory standards to be better 
targeted and enforced.  
This article reports on the effect of implementing Continuous Emissions Monitoring 
Systems (CEMS) and reporting the data to the regulator in Surat, India. The goal was to 
help to reduce reliance on frequent manual monitoring, providing significant long- term 
cost and time savings, as well as increasing the reliability of readings.  
Overall,  it is unclear if the use of CEMS as an informative tool has had an impact on 
firms’  emissions. This may be attributed to multiple factors, especially the absence of a 
structured methodology for regulators to use and act upon CEMS data.  
We do not find any  difference between treatment and control after the intervention was in 
place, which could be explained by different reasons. In the first place, treatment and control are installing CEMS devices, the main difference between treatment and control 
is that t he treated group is reporting their data to the regulator. So even though the 
control group is not reporting data to the regulator, the fact that they have the device 
could be changing their behavior, attenuating our results. The second possibility is that  
as there is no change in the regulation yet, treated firms  are not changing their behavior 
in answer to our treatment, as the regulator cannot enforce any punishment based on 
CEMS data.  
We believe that the installation and connection of CEMS is a first s tep to changes in 
regulation as now the Gujarat Pollution Control Board has high frequency data that they 
could also use for future regulation. Market -based regulations would allow regulators to 
address many city and regional problems with water and air pollution at a lower cost than is possible today, and the installation of this devices is a necessary step to do this.

India today has the highest levels of air pollution in the world.  Of the 20 cities in the world 
with the worst fine particulate air pollution, 13 are in India, including Delhi, the worst -
ranked city (W orld Health Organization, 2013). Studies find that the average Indian loses 
about three years of his or her life due to the harm of this pollution (Greenstone et al., 
2015). There is also growing evidence that high levels of pollution lower labor 
productivity and, therefore, potentially economic growth (Zivin and Neidell, 2013; Hanna and Oliva, 2015).  
As the world identifies policies to address climate change, it is critical that the domestic concerns of emerging economies like India are addressed and potentially leveraged so 
as to reduce stark trade- offs between reducing emissions and lowering growth. While 
India’s growth poses challenges, it also presents an opportunity to exemplify strategies 
that can be adopted elsewhere.  
The way people of means cope with air pollution is to av oid it; to commute by car with 
the windows closed or sit in an air -conditioned office. These options are not available to 
the poor, who must often work outside, and so are differentially exposed to air pollution (Saksena et al., 2003). Thus while air pollution is a public harm, benefits from reducing 
air pollution may accrue more to poorer people due to their greater exposure. The pilots 
we propose may have immediate impacts on the local population of Surat in Gujarat (a 
city of over 4 million inhabitants).  
If good information on who pollutes is available, then traditional environmental regulation 
can bring down emissions somewhat (Duflo et al., 2013), but regulators may lack the will 
or resources to penalize every polluter. What more can government due to c ontain such 
widespread damages?     
In his canonical essay on “The Problem of Social Cost”, Ronald Coase argued it should 
perhaps do nothing. His very first example “is that of a factory the smoke from which has 
harmful effects on those occupying neighbouring properties” (Coase, 1960). Coase 
argues that taxing the factory’s emissions or holding the owner liable is not desirable or 
necessary, since if property rights are well -defined, and parties are well -informed, then 
the owner and other parties can work out the right level of pollution and compensation for 
the harm suffered. The United States and other countries have put this notion to work in “third wave” environmental regulations that require information disclosure, but have no 
formal enforcement provisions.  
The current system of command- and-control approach to regulation is widely perceived 
as ineffective and imposing large burdens on polluting industries. Market -based 
instruments for environmental regulation have a successful track record (Stavins, 1998), 
but are seldom used in developin g countries.  
Present environmental regulations are seen as costly and unreliable. India is only likely to adopt more stringent regulations if they do not compromise economic growth.   Policy -
makers are keenly interested in innovative ways to reduce air poll ution, as evidenced by 
the recent adoption of driving restrictions in New Delhi (the “odd- even” scheme). 
However, such short -term fixes can be costly for citizens, which may undermine support 
for regulation in the long- term. A proof -of-concept for market -based regulations would 2 allow regulators to address many city and regional problems with water and air pollution 
at a lower cost than is possible today.  
The Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) pilot project for particulate matter (PM) is 
designing, implementing,  and evaluating an innovative approach to pollution in India. As 
a regulatory instrument, emissions trading has the potential to eliminate the trade- off 
between environmental quality and growth by improving air quality through a mechanism 
that is transpare nt, predictable, and costs firms  less to comply.  
With a city population of 5 million and metropolitan population of 6.5 million, Surat is the second largest city in Gujarat and home to 15% of the state’s small -scale industrial units, 
most of which are in t he textile sector. All  firms  are located approximately 20 km from the 
city center, and thus their emissions were expected to affect ambient pollutant 
concentrations for a large sub- population. With a population density in the Surat 
Metropolitan Area (which encompasses the industrial clusters in the sample) of 4,065 
persons/km
2, a crude estimate of the number of people in a 20 km radius affected by 
industrial emissions is 5.1 million. This rough calculation heightens the case for improved 
emissions monitorin g and regulation by showing the substantial number of lives exposed 
to poor air quality and who would benefit from improved environmental regulation.  
2. Intervention  
2.1 Description  
We are working with the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, the 
Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and State Pollution Control Boards of Gujarat 
(GPCB), in setting up an ambitious pilot ETS for PM from industrial sources.  A critical 
intermediate stage from implementing this project involves the rollout of Continuous 
Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS) to monitor PM emissions at the stack, which 
greatly improves the information and ability of regulators to monitor firms , allowing 
regulatory standards to be better targeted and enforced.  
A regulatory action framework for treatment firms was designed which included  CEMS 
installation and  a list of criteria to characterize non -compliant behavior, along with the 
corresponding regulatory actions taken by GPCB.  
For adopting CEMS, one of the fir st steps is to select a device (or combination of devices 
if flow meter is required) optimally suitable for the stack characteristics at the firm. 
Important considerations include stack diameter, flue gas temperature, and Air Pollution 
Control Devices (APC Ds) installed, among others. In parallel, firms  also need to select a 
CEMS vendor from which to purchase the equipment . The equipment has to be paid by 
the firm, and GPCB should check that each firm has installed CEMS according to their 
phase. Then, after installing the equipment , the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) 
indicate whether the firm can proceed to calibration of the device and the test each 
CEMS device must pass to be in compliance with the ETS  performance standards. 
Calibrating CEMS devices allowed the detection of device malfunctions and resolution of 
misreporting, thereby improving data accuracy. The steps for setting up the CEMS 
devices are described in table 1.

The action framework is designed to target worst -performing firms  on two criteria, PM 
performance and data performance, with the aim of eventually fine- tuning performance 
criteria as variance across the sample reduces over time. A key feature of the framework 
is that it actively works against the natural tendency of com mand -and-control regulation, 
where severe punishment is meted out at any instance of non- compliance. Instead, the 
framework offers a graded set of actions, which escalate in severity with the level of non-compliance. Further, a graded set of actions target ed at a specific section of plants 
enables efficient use of the regulator’s limited capacity, allowing for this system to be absorbed into the status quo. Tables 2 and 3 describe the specifics of GPCB regulatory 
actions for non- compliance as per the Action Framework.

In April 2018, GPCB formalized rules for using CEMS data to regulate firm PM 
emissions. Two workshops were held in Surat, where regulators and firms  were trained 
on the use of CEMS weekly reports and its grading across the Framework’s set of 
actions. At the workshop, firms were trained on the web portal through which they could monitor their Data Availability and Emissions to avoid featuring under weekly worse 
performers in the GPCB generated performance reports.  
Implemented in a staggered manner, GPCB initially started in March 2018 by sending 
auto- generated SMS/ emails  to firms that did not achieve the PM requirements or the 
data availability requirem ents shown in table 2 and 3.  The exceedance is calculated as a 
moving average within a 15 minutes period.  The letters were sent since May 2018. The 
meetings started in July 2018 and the site- visits and sample collection started in 
September 2018.  
Even thou gh GPCB  cannot enforce any punishment based on CEMS data , the structure 
of the treatment allows GPCB to inspect a firm if they do not comply with the treatment 
for 4 weeks in a row, as is shown in table 2 and 3. During the inspection GPCB collects a PM sam ple, if the sample indicate that the firm is violating the industrial emissions, the 
regulator must take actions that could lead to the closure of the firm.  5 2.2 Theory of C hange  
A critical challenge in reducing PM emissions is ineffective monitoring and regulation of 
industrial emissions. Previous work by Duflo et al. (201 3) shows a high non- compliance 
rate that was compounded by poor monitoring by third party auditors.  The ETS program 
is a pilot emissions trading scheme for particulate matter air polluti on in 350 highly -
polluting industries in Surat, Gujarat. In this program, treatment industries will receive 
particulate matter load permits that they can choose to trade over the course of a 
regulatory compliance period. Our theory of change is that a cap- and-trade market will 
be more effective at reducing emissions than a command- and-control system because a 
cap-and-trade has reliable monitoring, the requirement to hold permits is transparent and 
market -based systems have lower costs of compliance, making it easier to reduce 
emissions.  Actual emissions will be monitored through CEMS installed in all industry 
smokestacks. If industries have emitted in exceedance of the permits they hold at the 
end of any particular compliance period, they will be penalized by the  environmental 
regulator, the Gujarat Pollution Control Board.  A prerequisite for setting up the trading 
regime is improved monitoring of emissions among the participant firms , through CEMS.  
Using CEMS, it is possible to estimate the total mass of pollutants released into the 
atmosphere over any time period, a quantity that is more directly relevant to pollution 
health impacts than the instantaneous concentration. Because CEMS devices supply 
real-time data on emissions from the industrial stack, they dramatically improve the 
frequency and quantity of particulate emissions data available to regulators  and the firms 
themselves . Currently, plant emissions are measured in terms of concentration of 
pollutants over a short period of time. Thus, plants reporting under CEMS are expected 
to display greater incentive to conserve kilograms of fuel burned relative to the status 
quo. Hence, we expect to see lower overall PM emissions for industries in the tr eatment 
group (with PM CEMS devices) than those in the control group (without PM CEMS 
devices).  
A CEMS regime helps reduce reliance on frequent manual monitoring, providing 
significant long- term cost and time savings, as well as great potential for increas ing the 
reliability of readings. It also enables policy partners to generate a rigorous and 
comprehensive database of pollution data from the major pollutants across any given 
region. Real time emissions data would enable better -informed decisions and 
policymaking related to air pollution. In addition, continuous monitoring enables a highly 
transparent regulatory system and opens up options such as public release of emissions information in real time.  
The primary outcomes of interest for this evaluation are the level and variance of 
pollution emissions in the treatment group, as well as level of pollution and compliance 
costs of treatment relative to control plants. The former will be measured through real -
time CEMS data over the course of the evaluation, and the latter will be measured 
through detailed firm surveys.  
Baseline data for sample plants has been collected through a detailed technical survey that collected information on plant configurations and conducted PM stack sampling. The 
survey shows that mo re than 70 percent of the firms are not complying with the 
regulatory standard of 150 mg/Nm
3 for particulates . Figure 1 shows the distribution of PM 6 samples collected, with the red line representing the regulatory standard of 150 mg/Nm3 
for particulates .  
Figure 1: Distribution of PM Sample Baseline
 
2.3 Monitoring plan  
The outcomes we are interested to  evaluat e with this project  are the level and variance 
of pollution emissions in the treatment relative to control plants, as well as the 
compliance costs of treatment plants relative to control plants.  Actual emissions will be 
monitored through Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS) installed in all 
treated firms’  smokestacks.  
Over the course of the CEMS installation, we collected records on when firms  have 
completed all of the intermediate steps  of installation, from placing a purchase order, to 
passing a postcalibration test. This data helps us to identify bottlenecks and make recommendations for further process improvements.  
In 2017 the GPCB undertook a careful auditing exercise of plants inst alling CEMS 
devices following a regulatory mandate. Typically these monitors are installed by 
technology vendors and calibrated on site, with payments made by firms. The accuracy 
of this calibration underlies the accuracy of the CEMS architecture—if the ca libration 
coefficients are falsified, CEMS reported readings will also be under -estimates. Thanks 
to a careful data collection regime, the GPCB was able to document that when calibration was carried out by plants, CEMS measurements were consistently lower than 
prior manual inspections had suggested they should be. The devices were therefore 
audited and independent calibrations were carried out. The true calibration factors were 
found to be very different from those initially reported, and consequently true emissions 
much higher.  
Once firms  have established connectivity, we also maintain records on why the devices 
go offline, categorize any hardware and software problems, and track firm grievances 
and vendor responses. Data Acquisition and Handling Center co ordinators additionally 
make intermittent site visits to troubleshoot and resolve firm’s  issues.  
7 The CEMS data availability provides an account of minute- wise emissions data 
generated by CEMS devices throughout an entire day. Through daily interactions wi th 
firms and follow -ups with hardware and vendors, we have been able to synthesize 
proactive and sustainable solutions to ensure high and accurate data availability from 
CEMS.  
3. Evaluation  
3.1 Primary and secondary questions  
The primary question is, does CEMS intervention affect the level and variance of the 
plant’s pollution emissions? For measuring this we will evaluate how the emissions 
measured by CEMS in the treatment group vary after the implementation. Also we will compare the level and variance of pollution in the treatment relative to control plants, 
given by the PM samples taken in the baseline and endline. The secondary question is, does CEMS intervention affect the abatement  costs of treatment plants relative to control 
plants ? We will measure  the abatement cost through detailed firm surveys.  
3.2 Design and methods  
The evaluation design is a randomized- control trial at the level of the industrial plant, 
where the main outcomes are plant pollution and abatement costs. The main problem 
with past studies of the effects of emissions markets on pollution and abatement costs is 
the absence of a clear counter -factual for what plants would have emitted under another 
regulatory regime, such as command- and-control regulation. Our design solves this 
problem by having a control group that remains subject to status quo, command- and-
control regulation as the treatment group is brought under an emissions market.  
CEMS rollout is divided into 4 phases for logistic reasons. As CEMS calibration and 
connection invol ves heavy coordination with the firms , CEMS vendors and environmental 
laboratories, CEMS rollout is divided into various phases to smoothly run the operations. 
Although all firms  in the CEMS sample will eventually install continuous monitoring 
devices as p art of the ETS evaluation, the design has randomly assigned approximately 
half of these firms  (called Phase- II firms ) to install their devices prior to the rest (called 
Phase -IV). Hence during the period between the completion of Phase- II installations and 
beginning of Phase IV installations, Phase II firms  will have been treated with CEMS, 
while Phase IV firms  will continue to face status quo manual sample monitoring by 
GPCB.  
The main outcomes of interest are plant pollution and abatement costs. Pollution  will be 
measured using CEMS devices that record, at very high frequency, the mass of pollution being emitted from each stack.  Even though some control firms will have installed CEMS 
devices, the data connectivity for them is very low, so we would just hav e CEMS data for 
the treatment group. Pollution levels could be compared between the treatment and control group through samples taken during the baseline and endline.  Costs will be 
measured using detailed plant -level surveys on capital, maintenance and operating 
expenditures for abatement equipment.  8 3.3 Ethics  
This study does not involve human subjects, and we do not anticipate any risks to 
respondents in this evaluation.  Participating firms are required by environmental 
regulators to install additional equipment.  
3.4 Sampling and data collection  
The sample of industrial plants was drawn to comprise all the largest point sources of 
emissions in the Surat metropolitan area. This industrial cluster was selected due to 
having a large number of heavily polluting plants in close proximity to an urban center.  
The sample was drawn using administrative data from GPCB on fuel type and stack diameter, cross -checked against field visits. To be eligible, a source had to use solid or 
liquid fossil fuels and to have a stack (chimney) suitable for the installation of CE MS 
devices. Amongst the list of eligible sources, the GPCB, with the advice of our team, 
selected the largest 350, in terms of fuel consumption, in order to include the major sources of particulate emissions.  
We use data from the endline survey of Duflo et al. (2013) on pollution levels and abatement costs as inputs. We restrict the sample to industrial plants in Surat with PM 
emissions and a stack diameter of 0.25 meters, which are the rough sample selection 
criteria for the evaluation. The below table pr esents the calculation inputs. The mean 
level of PM is 194 mg/Nm3, above the regulatory standard of 150 mg/Nm3. Assuming 
the correlation between baseline and endline concentration readings is 0.60, achieving a 
power of about 80% against the null of no chance in emissions concentration yields an 
effect size of 19.5% reduction in PM emissions concentration.

sample of 373 industrial plants have 765 eligible stacks, because some plants have 
multiple stacks. Sample plants are located in highly -polluted industrial clusters and had 
high pollution potential. These plants are predominantly (94%) in the textile industry.  
They most often burn coal (37%) or lignite (27%) but a fair number also use liquid fuel 
such as diesel (14%).  
The study uses a randomised phase- in design for the evaluation of the new CEMS 
monitoring regime in the Surat industrial cluster in Gujarat. The evaluation initially began 
with a small group of pilot installations (Phase I roll -out) which are firms that are 
representative of the sample and are non- random. This phase is followed by random 
assignment of the remaining sample of plants to one of three experimental treatment 9 groups. The randomization was done in a  stratified manner, within groups of firms on the 
basis of geographical area, which we call industrial -cluster from now on, and baseline 
PM emissions, for more statistical power.  Each treatm ent group of firms was mandated 
to install PM CEMS and begin sending CEMS data to the regulator in a staggered 
manner across three phases, numbered II, III, and IV. In this phase- in design, plants 
without CEMS connections who were assigned to later phases,  would serve as a control 
group for the plants in Phase I and II who installed CEMS first. Table 5 lists the number

The purpose of the pilot phase was to field- test the CEMS installation and calibration 
protocol stipulated in the Central Pollution Control Board CEMS specifications. A batch 
size of 11 firms from Surat cluster was selected, and 4 vendors supplied 9 DC 
triboelectric -based (measures PM mass flow) and 2 electr odynamic -based (measures 
PM mass concentration) devices. The 11 firms  were chosen based on the 
representativeness of the sample in terms of the size of the firms  and the air pollution 
control devices installed, and the willingness of the firms  to participate in the pilot.

3.4.1 Plant survey  
We have developed a detailed firm quantitative survey to measure key outcomes of 
interest, which will be administered at baseline and endline. The survey instrument has a 
general section to collect data regarding the firms’ fuel consumption, production and 
revenues to understand the scale of operations within the firm, and a technical section to 
collect information on all emission sources and installed abatement measures installed. 
The technical section can be customized based on the number of stacks within a firm, 
the number of parallel chains within each stack, and the number and type of installed 
equipment in each parallel chain. It captures detailed information about each piece of 
equipment, including the year of installation, the technical design, and t he operations and 
maintenance costs  Assessed for eligibility (n=  )

Analysis  Follow -Up Randomized (n=  )  Enrolment  11 The first round of firm surveys was conducted in late 2014. The second round was 
conducted in 2016, previous to the treatment implementation, and the endline survey 
was conducted between December 2018 and March 2019.  
3.4.2 CEMS  
Pollution is measured using Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS) that 
record, at very high frequency, the mass of pollution being emitted from each stack. Also, over the course of the CEMS installation, we have collected records on when firms  have 
completed all of the intermediate steps of installation, from placing a purchase order, to 
passing a post calibration test.  
Calibration process of CEMS devices involve comparing CEMS readings against manual 
sample measurements. In figure 3 we plot the correlation be tween CEMS readings and 
the manual samples in standard deviations. There is a high correlation among CEMS 
reading and PM samples. Table 6  measures the correlation between manual samples 
and CEMS readings in standard deviations, with firm fixed effects. The  correlation is as 
expected, positive and significant, which validates CEMS reading as a way to measure 
pollution.

12 3.4.3 Ringelmann  
The Ringelmann test consists on a measure of the apparent  density or opacity of smoke, 
based on its color. We hired and trained a group of surveyors to observe each firm stack 
from the outside for intervals of half an hour. The training of all Ringelmann surveyors is 
standardized. Surveyors are trained for 3 days of practical field exercises before they 
begin surveying. The training consists of the following protocol:  
1. Surveyor stands 45- 100-meter distance from stack. 2  
2. Mark position of surveyor, the stack, the sun, and the direction of flue gas using 
standardized clock notation.  
3. Begin the survey; smoke ratings are assigned from 0- 5 (using standard 
Ringelmann Chart) everyone minute, for 30 minutes. 30 observations, along with 
one photo each minute, comprise the completed Ringelmann Survey.  
The surveyor will be given a smoke chart, which has five different shades of gray scaled 
from 1 to 5, and she will have to compare the color of the smoke for the 30 minutes 
period, reporting which number better represents the color of the firm smoke every 
minute. The average of these 30 observations will give us the Ringelmann score. Surveyors are required to upload pictures of the stack at start of the survey and at the 
end of the survey for each firm. Each stack has the firm name mentioned on it, we are 
able track whether the surveyors are covering respective industries or not.  
The advantage of Ringelmann data is that is very easy and cheap to get, so we could 
have many observations for each firm over time. The problem is that it could be not as 
highly correlated with air pollution as PM samples or CEMS data. For that reason, we will be using PM sampling data, CEMS data and Ringelmann data for the pollution analysis.  
Each Ringelmann round consists on a period of approximately two weeks where 
surveyors are visiting firms . Four rounds were conducted before the treatment started 
and nine rounds were conducted after the implementation of the treatment.  
We evaluate the correlation observed betw een the stack sampling (in logs) in each 
survey and the Ringelmann values. Table 7 shows the correlation for the stack sampling 
and the Ringelmann values, controlling for variables that could be affecting the outcome 
variable. Specifically in column 1 we are controlling for sun position, plume position, 
Ringlemann round, approximate distance to the stack and weather. In column 2 we add 
lab fixed effects. All of the point estimates calculated in the tables are positive and 
significant, which validates Ringel mann data as a way to measure pollution.

  15 4. Findings  
4.1 Intervention implementation fidelity  
Table 7 shows  firm operational status, CEMS purchase orders, installation and 
calibration at the time of the endline, and a mean -comparison test between treatment  
(phase II firms ) and control  (phase IV firms ). We have the operational status for all 
treatment and control firms, but the rest of the variables are only for operational firms , 
with some missing values. Almost all firms  were still operating by the time of the endline, 
but there is a small and significant difference among treatment and control in the 
operational status, with the treatment group having more permanently closed firms . At 
the time of the survey, almost all treatment firms  had their purchase orders and 
installat ion of CEMS devices done. At the same time, 40 percent of the firms  in the 
control group also had installed CEMS. As CEMS is a new technology, it is expected that 
some of the control group firms  will be willing to install the devices. We are not worried 
about contamination of the treatment to the control group measured by the installation, 
as the main outcome of interest of our treatment is observing how firms  behave when 
they know that the regulator has access to high frequency data on their air pollution, 
given by CEMS. Table 8 shows that 76 percent of treatment firms  had their devices 
calibrated, compared to only 8 percent of the control group. The most relevant outcome 
for the implementation fidelity is the data connectivity, as that is the way the regulator 
could observed the firm pollution, which was 97 percent for treatment firms  and 0 for the 
control group.

Figure 4 shows the timing and the number of firms  that passed the calibration of the 
CEMS devices by treatment group. The blue line represents the treatment group, and as 
it can be seen, firms  from the treatment started calibrated their devices on July 2017, 16 opposed to control firms , represented by the red line, which began to calibrate their 
devices in January 2019.   
Figure 4: Calibration by Treatment  
 
We plot the number of firms  reporting data over time in figure 5. The blue line represents 
the treatment group and the red line represents the control. The dashed line shows the 
date when the actions began to be implemented. As it can be noticed, the number of 
treated firms  reportin g data over time is increasing, while the number of control firms  
reporting data is zero, during the whole period analyzed.

4.2 Impact analysis 
4.2.1 Descriptive statistics and balance tables  Table 9 presents a randomization check using baseline characteristics of plants in the 
study sample, showing that plant characteristics are balanced by treatment assignment. 
Of all of the baseline measures reported, there is  just two variables that has a s ignificant 
difference between the treatment and the control group at the 10% level. In Panel A we 17 consider plant economic characteristics that could be related with pollution and their 
boiler and thermopack capacity. The control group has a bigger boiler c apacity on 
average but a lower thermopack capacity, with none of these differences being significant.  In panel B we consider characteristics of the plants associated with the 
APCDs they have in the baseline. The most common AP CD is the Cyclon, and on 
average control and treatment firms have around 4. Panel C shows all the plant 
characteristics related to pollution, measured at the baseline. It appears that on average, 
treatment plants have a higher concentration of PM given by the PM sample, but this 
difference is not  significant. Table A1 presents the balance check for the firms in the 
baseline which were also interviewed at the endline.

Table 10 shows the treatment effects on PM samples  and compliance at the endline.  
The observations are less than the initial sample because some of the firms closed 
during the treatment.  In the first column we ran an OLS where we regress the endline 
PM concentrati on with the treatment status, controlling by the PM concentration at the 
baseline. In column 2 we add a fixed effects for the lab taking the sample. Column 3 and 4 have the same regressions as the previous two columns, but now regressing the log of 
the PM samples. Column 5 and 6 regress a dummy that takes the value of one if the firm 
is complying to the norm of PM of less than 150 mg/Nm
3. The average PM concentration 
at the endline is 185 mg/Nm3 with a standard deviation of 211, and at the baseline the 
average was 338 mg/Nm3 with a standard deviation of 374. Columns 7 and 8 regress a 
probit and a logit respectively, finding also not significant effects. The treatment effect 
calculated in every specification is insignificant, showing that there is no signific ant 
difference between the treatment and the pollution at the endline measured by PM 
samples.

Figure 6 shows the coefficients for regressions for each Ringelmann round by treatment

the treatment started. As it can be seen, no coefficient is statis tically different from the 
average of the pre- treatment period.

20 Using  the CEMS reading from the devices that are reporting data, we could measure the 
mean daily PM concentration among treated firms  over time. This measure is reported 
on figure 7. The red line shows when the actions started. The PM concentration is 
calculated as the mean of the daily average concentration of each firm that is reporting 
data for at least one minute during that day. As it can be noticed on figure 7, the PM 
concentration does not seem to be changing too much over time, but the variance of the 
concentration is clearly decreasing overtime, with a big decrease after the treatment 
started  
Figure 7: CEMS PM Concentration Over Time  
 
Note: PM concentration is calculated as the mean of the daily average concentration of each firm 
that is reporting data for at least one minute during that day.  
Table 1 2 shows an OLS for the treatment effect on APCDs , the capital cost and, 
operation and maintenance costs of the APCDs each firm has at the endline. The first 
column shows an OLS  regression for  estimating the treatment effect on the number of 
APCDs a firm has at the endline, controlling by the number of A PCD the firm had at the 
baseline. Column 2 has a similar regression, with the dependent variable being a dummy that takes the value of one if the firm increased the number of APCDs they had with 
respect to the baseline. The point estimat es of the number an d the dummy of increasing 
the number of APCDs is positive, as we expected, but the effect is not significant. As the number of APCDs does not exactly matches investments firms could be doing for reducing their pollution, we evaluate if the capital cost of APCDs  for firms in the 
treatment compared to the control group have increased. The point estimate has  the sign 
we expected, as we expected that the treatment would increase the investments firms do 
on APCDs , but still the effect is  not significant.  
The maintenance cost consists in annual testing cost, cost of repairs and small replacements, and cleaning costs per month. The operations costs consist on electricity 
cost, labor cost and inputs (water and chemicals). Column 4 has an OLS regression 
estima ting the treatment effect on the operation and maintenance cost. The point 
estimat e for the treatment effect on the sum of these costs are negative, but also not 
significant.

4.2.3 Heterogeneity of impacts   
Finally, we explore if there is a heterogeneous response to the treatment based on the 
initial type of APCDs each firm had. We construct four dummies, one for each type of 
APCD. Each dummy takes the value of 1 if the firm  had that type of APCD by the time of 
the baseline. We interact those dummies with the treatment  and regress these variables 
against pollution level in t he endline sample controlling for initial number of APCDs , and 
Table 1 3 shows the results. There is only one APCD, the gravity settling chamber, that is 
not included in the regression because only one firm has it. We find that the presence of 
Bag Filters a nd ESP is correlated with the plant having less pollution by the end line. 
Despite that, we do not find evidence that having those APCDs made the firm more responsive to the treatment, as we do not find evidence of any heterogeneous response.

5. Cost analysis  
The first step for adopting CEMS is to select a device (or combination of devices if flow 
meter is required) optimally suitable for the stack characteristics at the firm. The two 
most affordable PM CEMS technologies are DC and AC Tribos and almost all the firms  
in Surat have installed them. The prices of CEMS Tribos ranges from 200,000 to 
300,000 rupees  (2798 to 4198 US dollars) .  23 Even though the intervention does not seem to be effective as we are unable to find a 
difference in behavior between the treatment and the control, the installation and data 
connectivity is a first step to implement regulation and policies based on high frequency 
data.  
CEMS is the total equipment necessary to determine concentration or emission rate of a 
gas or particulate matter. The system of CEMS was introduced with a promise of more 
efficient pollution regulation and lower costs of compliance. The underlying assumption is 
that regulators will utilize high -quality industrial pollution information to make effective 
decisions. However, for this to be true, the technology needs to be seamlessly integrated 
into the industrial pollution reporting system.  
6. Discussion  
6.1 In troduction  
Like many industrial clusters in India, the majority of firms  in Surat burn solid fuel and are 
noncompliant with current environmental regulation.  
This project has already generated widespread interest among Indian policymakers to 
use CEMS for pollution monitoring and has huge and immediate potential for scale up. In 
fact, CPCB has already mandated that 17 categories of large, highly polluting firms  
nationwide install CEMS for various air and water pollutants. Since this mandate was 
issued, these installations have proceeded with fits and starts across states and sectors.  
The limitations of this study are two. In the first place, as it can be noticed  in table 7, 
CEMS devices are being installed by the treatment and the control group, so if there is 
an effect of installing the device in the polluting behavior of the firm, the coefficients 
would be attenuated. In the second place, even though now GPCB h as high frequency 
data on pollution, the  current  regulation is based on PM samples that the regulator has to 
take during inspections to the firms. Given that, we expect that the regulator is using CEMS data to target better the inspections and take samples  on firms that they know are 
violating the regulation. In order to evaluate this, future research is needed with data on 
inspections from GPCB.  
6.2 Policy and programme relevance: evidence uptake and use  
The project is being conducted jointly with all of t he concerned environmental regulators 
in order to building policy influence from the start. These regulators include the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC), the Central Pollution Control 
Board (CPCB) and the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB).  
Present environmental regulations are seen as costly and unreliable. The regulation is based on samples that GPCB has to take while they are inspecting a firm. CEMS helps 
reducing reliance on frequent manual monitoring, providing signif icant long -term cost and 
time savings, as well as great potential for increasing the reliability of readings. It also 
enables policy partners to generate a rigorous and comprehensive database of pollution 
data from the major pollutants across any given region. Real time emissions data would 
enable better informed decisions and policymaking related to air pollution. In addition, 24 continuous monitoring enables a highly transparent regulatory system and opens up 
options such as public release of emissions infor mation in real time.  
6.3 Challenges and lessons  
The main challenge about CEMS monitoring regime is whether the data is reliable. This 
issue is important because like any other metering device, CEMS also require calibration 
and auditing. These tasks must be carried out by trained regulatory staff, or acc redited 
third-party  regulators. In prior work, Duflo et al (2013) have documented how regular 
plant monitoring can lead to falsified results because plants may be required to hire and pay the environmental labs that are responsible for testing them. In Section 3.4 we used 
additional pollution outcome measures to test the reliability of CEMS and  found strong 
correlates with these measures.  
7. Conclusions and recommendations  
This article reports on the effect of implementing Continuous Emissions Monitoring 
Systems and reporting the data to the regulator in Surat, India. The goal was to help to 
reduce reliance on frequent manual monitoring, providing significant long- term cost and 
time savings, as well as increasing the reliability of readings. In addition, continuous 
monitoring enables a highly transparent regulatory system and opens up options such as 
public release of emissions information in real time.  
Before our intervention, the levels of pollution of the firms  in the sample were high, and 
the compliance with the regulation was low. Our analysis studies the effect of installing 
CEMS and reporting data to GPCB, with an intervention were firms were notified if they 
were among the worst firms in terms of pollution or data availability.  
In Section 3.4 we showed that data from CEM S is reliable, as it strongly correlates with 
other measures of pollution, so despite CEMS could be subject to manipulation through 
their calibration, this does not seem to be the case as the devices installed in this 
intervention are working and reporting accurate data.  
Overall, it is unclear if the use of CEMS as an informative tool has had an impact on 
firms’  emissions. This may be attributed to multiple factors, especially the absence of a 
structured methodology for regulators to use and act upon CEMS data. Having said this, CEMS may achieve its intended purpose of lowering emissions if it is suppl emented  by a 
robust system which ensures accountability of all stakeholders and consequently 
galvanizes them into committing to high quality data transfer.  
Despite we do not find any difference between treatment and control after the 
intervention was in place, this could be explained by different reasons. In the first place, 
it could be the case that our estimations are lacking enough power. Even though that is  a 
possibility, because our sample is not very big and our variables are noisy, we find very consistently over our study a not significant effect in all of the outcomes we measured. A 
second possibility is that treatment and control are installing CEMS dev ices as we show 
in Section 4.1, so even though the control group is not reporting data, the fact that they 
have the device could be changing their behavior as well, so it could be the case that 
treatment and control are reacting to the intervention, attenu ating our results. The third  
possibility is that as there is no change in the regulation yet, firms  are not changing their 25 behavior. We believe that the installation and connection of CEMS is a first step to 
changes in regulation as now GPCB has high frequency data that they could use to 
target better their inspections, but that they could also use in the future for regulation . 
Market -based regulations would allow regulators to address many city and regional 
problems with water and air pollution at a lower cost than is possible today, and the 
installation of this devices is a necessary step to do this.
