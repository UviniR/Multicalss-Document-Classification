Abstract
Objective. T o determine if reliable, objective audiologic data
can be obtained by nonotolaryngology and nonaudiologypractitioners using novel mobile technology in an effort toexpand the capacity for early identification and treatment ofdisabling hearing loss in the developing world.
Study Design. Cross-sectional, proof-of-concept pilot study.
Setting. Screenings took place during an annual 2-week oto-
laryngology surgical mission in October 2016 in semirural
Malindi, Kenya.
Subject and Methods. Eighty-seven patients (174 total ears)
were included from 2 deaf schools (n = 12 and 9), a nondeaf
school (n = 9), a tuberculosis ward (n = 8), and a walk-in
otology clinic at a local hospital (n = 49). An automated,tablet-based, language-independent, clinically validated, playaudiometry system and wireless otoscopic endoscopy via aniPhone or laptop platform was administered by Kenyancommunity health workers (CHWs) and nursing staff.
Results. Various degrees of hearing loss and otologic
pathology were identified, including 1 child presumed tobe deaf who was found to have unilaterally normal hear-ing. Other pathology includ ed 2 active perforations, 2
healed perforations, 2 middle ear effusions, and 1 choles-
teatoma. CHWs and nursing staff demonstrated profi-
ciency performing audiogram s and endoscopy. Patients
screened in a deaf school were more likely to completean unreliable audiogram than patients screened in othersettings ( P\.01).
Conclusion. This study demonstrates the feasibility of a non–
otolaryngology-based hearing screening program. This maybecome an important tool in reducing the impact of hearingloss and otologic pathology in areas bereft of otolaryngolo-gists and audiologists by allowing CHWs to gather impor-tant patient data prior to otolaryngologic evaluation.Keywords

The vast majority (80%) of disabling hearing loss is
found in low- and middle-income countries(LMICs).
1Unfortunately, the countries with the
highest burden of hearing loss are often those least able tohelp patients accommodate to their disability.
2In these
regions, early identification and treatment are of the utmost
importance, as deafness can cause significant functional
impairment in the ability of these individuals to contributeproductively to society.
2Sub-Saharan Africa, unfortunately,
has very limited otolaryngology and audiology capacity.3In
Kenya specifically, there are 1.2 otolaryngologists and 0.12audiologists per 1,000,000 people, respectively.
2The United
Kingdom’s (UK’s) National Health System is designed toapportion health care providers according to census data. As
such, there are 10 otolaryngologists and 41 audiologists in
practice per 1,000,000 people in the UK.
3Extrapolating
these figures, Kenya has just 12.1% and 0.3% of the capac-ity of otolaryngologists and audiologists, respectively, com-pared with an appropriately proportioned developedcountry. Shortages of otolaryngology and audiology services

in Kenya and other LMICs pose challenges to early identifi-
cation and treatment of otologic pathology.4
Despite having limited access to hearing health care pro-
viders, Kenya, like many LMICs, has a surprisingly robusttelecommunications infrastructure.
5In fact, an estimated
88% of Kenyan adults have a cellphone and 81% have
access to the Internet.6,7These numbers, which are only
increasing, have allowed e-Health and m-Health platformsto play a significant role in expanding the capacity of healthcare providers in LMICs.

In an effort to expand the capac ity for otolaryngologists and
audiologists to identify treatable hearing loss, we piloted anovel, presurgical screening tool designed to be conducted bynurses and nonmedical staff with m inimal training using exist-
ing infrastructure (mobile and I nternet technology). The screen-
ing tool consisted of a 2-armed system employing a tablet-basedplay audiometry and otoscopic endoscopy to record dual objec-tive measures that can be used by otolaryngologists to determine
patient candidacy for audiologic ( ie, preferential classroom seat-
ing, hearing aids) or surgical intervention. The program was
designed to be simple, portable, language independent, and cost-effective to optimize it for use i n low-resource settings. This
study tests the feasibility of the af orementioned screening pro-
gram in multiple health care settings.
Methods
Study Design
A cross-sectional hearing screening program was used to assess
patients across a variety of setti ngs in semirural Malindi, Kenya.
Screenings took place during an annual 2-week head and necksurgical mission in October 2016. Participants underwent aformal audiometric evaluation and otologic endoscopic exami-nation. Local Kenyan nurses, community health workers
(CHWs), and nongovernmental or ganization volunteers were
trained and completed the audi ograms and examinations. Exams
were performed by local staff p rimarily without assistance
unless assistance was required, in which otolaryngology trainingstaff were available to troubleshoot.
Data were collected and organized using Microsoft Excel
(Redmond, Washington, USA). Basic statistics were com-pleted using IBM SPSS Statistics for Macintosh Version 24
(Armonk, New York, USA). Categorical variables were ana-
lyzed using a x
2test. This study was financially supported
by a voucher grant from the Vanderbilt Institute for Clinicaland Translational Research. Further funding was obtainedfrom the American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head andNeck Surgery Foundation Humanitarian Grant (A.D.L.J. andC.N.K. were recipients). This study was reviewed by theVanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional Review
Board (IRB) as IRB exempt because of minimal risk to the
subjects. Verbal consent was obtained from all participantsprior to proceeding, and all recorded data were deidentified.
Subjects
Patients were recruited from multiple locations. The walk-inclinic at Tawfiq Muslim Hospital (TMH) in Malindi,Kenya, was advertised with flyers in the community as well
as by word of mouth. Screenings also took place in threeschools, 2 of which serve deaf students (Gede SpecialSchool for the Deaf and the Kakayuni Special School forthe Deaf) and 1 that serves nondeaf students (Gede PrimarySchool). Local schools were contacted in advance to iden-
tify students who would benefit from audiometric evalua-
tion. Three children from the Silali Special School traveledto TMH and participated in the walk-in clinic at TMH. Inaddition, 8 patients from a local tuberculosis (TB) ward tra-veled to TMH for screenings to monitor for ototoxity.Participants who expressed discomfort with audiometricevaluation or otologic examination were excluded.
Screening Process
Each participant underwent otologic examination andscreening audiometric evaluation. Prior to screening, eachparticipant underwent a brief otoscopic examination toensure the presence of a patent external auditory canal.Patients with cerumen impaction underwent a limited ceru-men removal prior to endoscopic examination and audio-metric evaluation. Endoscopic images of the tympanicmembrane were captured using either a wireless otoscope
(Firefly Global DE550, Palo Alto, California, USA) or a
smartphone-enabled otoscope (Cellscope, San Francisco,California, USA; Figure 1 ). Smartphone-otoscopy images
were captured with and stored on an iPhone 6 (Apple,Cupertino, California, USA) using Cellscope-Oto for
Clinicians software (Cellscope). Wireless otoscopy images
were captured with a Firefly DE550 wireless otoscope(Firefly Global) and stored on a 32-Gb HP Stream laptop
(Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, California, USA). Costs of
equipment used are described in Table 1 . Of note, Shoebox
and Firefly Global offer humanitarian discounts for selectcases beyond what is quoted in Table 1 . Patients from the
TB ward underwent audiometric evaluation but wereexcluded from otologic endoscopy to prevent possibleequipment contamination.
Audiometric evaluation was conducted using an auto-
mated, language-independent, clinically validated, play
audiometry system (Shoebox Professional Audiometer byClearwater Clinical, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) on an iPadMini 2 tablet (Apple; Figure 2 ). ‘‘Play audiometry’’ is pre-
sented to the patient as a game in which the participant indi-cates whether he or she can hear a presented sound. Soundsare played at various frequencies with increasing decibel(dB) intensity via a modified Hughson-Westlake method in
an increasing-decreasing fashion until the correct threshold
is determined. Silent cues are presented at random to ensureparticipant understanding and compliance with the test.Continuous, frequency-specific background noise is moni-tored during the test, and tones presented during times ofincreased background noise are repeated. Unmasked pure-tone air and bone-conduction thresholds were performedusing a calibrated TDH-50 air transducer and a B-81 bone
transducer (Clearwater Clinical). Participants who self-
reported normal hearing underwent a screening audiogram2 OTO Open(thresholds limited to 500 and 2000 Hz). If found to have a
deficit, or in cases of self-reported hearing loss, participantsunderwent diagnostic evaluation (thresholds tested included500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz). Pediatric participants wereguided through the test by a trained provider. Adult partici-pants received instructions on how to use the application
and self-administered the testing under supervision of local
trained providers. All audiometric testing was completed ina quiet room. Audiograms were automatically encrypted,saved locally on the tablet, and uploaded to a secureInternet backup during WiFi availability. Patients wereassigned a unique medical record number to match theiraudiograms to their endoscopic images.
Outcomes
Audiogram results were categorized into mild (30-40 dB),moderate (41-60 dB), severe (61-80 dB), and profound(/C2180 dB) hearing loss. Ambient room noise prohibited
accurate measurements less than 30 dB. Hearing loss wasfurther categorized into sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL),conductive hearing loss (CHL), and mixed hearing loss. If apatient provided consistent affirmative responses in theabsence of a tone, the audiogram was automatically deemed
unreliable by the software. Unreliable audiograms were
excluded. Otoscopic images were reviewed by bothA.D.L.J. and C.N.K. and classified as normal, cerumenimpaction, active perforation, healed perforation, possiblecholesteatoma, and granulation tissue. Discrepancies
between A.D.L.J. and C.N.K. were resolved by J.L.N.
Results
One hundred seventy-four ears (n = 87 patients) were tested
in 5 different settings ( Table 2 ), including 2 deaf schools (n
= 12 and 9; Gede Special School for the Deaf and theKakayuni Special School for the Deaf), a nondeaf school (n
= 9; Gede Primary School), patients from a TB ward (n =
8), and a walk-in otology clinic at TMH (n = 49).
Of patients tested, 17 had unreliable audiograms. Most
(65%, 11/17) unreliable audiograms were obtained frompatients screened in deaf schools ( Table 3 ). In fact, patients
screening in a deaf school were more likely to complete anunreliable audiogram than patients screened in other settings(P\.01). Deaf children demonstrated poor understanding
of the play audiometry application despite sign language
explanations provided by their teachers. Only patients withreliable audiograms (n = 70) were included in the followingdescriptive statistics ( Table 2 ).
Three of nine (33%) children in the nondeaf school (Gede
Primary School) had mild SNHL; the remainder of childrenscreened had normal hearing. Most (73%; 8/11) patients fromthe 2 deaf schools were found to have severe-to-profound
SNHL. Notably, 1 patient in the deaf school had unilaterally
normal hearing, 1 had only mild SNHL, and another hadmoderate SNHL. Of patients from the TB ward, 50% (4/8)had normal hearing and 50% (4/8) had moderate SNHL.
Patients who presented to the walk-in clinic at TMH pre-
sented with a variety of otologic complaints and had subse-quently variable audiogram results. Sixteen patients (38%)presented with normal hearing, 19 (45%) had SNHL, and 7
(17%) had CHL ( Table 2 ).
Otoscopic examination revealed various patients with abnor-
mal tympanic membrane pathology. One patient presented with
a large, unilateral nasopharyngeal mass and was found to havea serous effusion with associated conductive hearing loss(Figure 3 ). Two ears revealed healed perforations, and 2 ears
demonstrated active perfora tions. One cholesteatoma wasTable 1. Cost for Equipment Used during the Hearing Screening

Discussion
The global burden of disabling hearing loss is overwhelm-ing, with eastern Asia, southern Asia, and Sub-SaharanAfrica most significantly affected.
2In Sub-Saharan Africa,
the calculated deficits of otolaryngologists and audiologists
when compared with UK service ratios are 4669 and
20,406, respectively.4This proof-of-concept study suggeststhat basic otologic and audiologic data can be captured by
individuals without formal otolaryngology or audiologytraining, thus shifting the burden away from already over-whelmed health care providers. Inferences about the inci-dence and prevalence of hearing loss and otologic pathologyin rural Kenya are outside of the scope of this study.
Given the relative paucity of hearing health care provi-
ders and the growing number of CHWs, the path moving
forward should foster development of programs that use our
CHW colleagues. It is estimated that there are more than 1

Many of these CHWs are using mobile technology to
expand their reach in LMICs.11In fact, several of our col-
leagues in other surgical subspecialties have capitalized onmobile technology use among CHWs. Ophthalmologists areusing CHWs to gather vision screening data using smart-phone technology.
12-14The African Teledermatology
Project has CHWs store and forward suspicious cases on asmartphone to expert dermatologists for diagnosis.
15
Orthopaedic surgeons and urologists are using smartphonetechnology to teach best-practice surgical techniques tothose in the LMICs.
16,17Although both tablet play audiome-
try and wireless endoscopic otoscope systems have beenclinically validated in both high- and low-resource settings,to our knowledge, this is the first CHW-based program inthe field of otolaryngology in LMICs.
18-23
Although CHW-based programs such as this can serve to
reduce some of the clinical burden of otolaryngologists in
LMICs, a number of barriers still exist. First, our pilot pro-gram uses multiple platforms (laptop, smartphone, andtablet), which is cumbersome for a CHW to collect effi-ciently. The ideal platform would collect both audiogramsand otoscopy on the same interface, which would eliminateextra steps in organizing the data collected. Second, noexisting audiogram application effectively accounts for
ambient noise, which can cause falsely positive hearing
screening failures in noisy settings. In addition, no audiogramplatform accounts for children who are unable to participatein traditional audiometry (developmentally delayed and chil-dren younger than 4-5 years). The ideal platform would alsoinclude otoacoustic emissions or automated auditory brain-stem responses to capture prelingual children to optimize theeffectiveness of the intervention. In addition, bone-conduction
measurements are limited as they are not available with
masking in the play audiometry mode. Therefore, the abilityof a CHW to gather information regarding CHL versusSNHL is limited, as masked bone conduction is not availablein an automated, easy-to-use format.
Despite testing only iPad-based audiometry, we did not
find that the features of an iPad (larger screen size, storagespace, etc) provided an essential advantage that would makehaving an iPad, as opposed to a mobile phone or laptop, an
essential component to a CHW-based hearing screening pro-
gram. Smartphone-based audiometer applications have beenrecently released and are available for lower cost (HearXPremium, $899) than iPad audiometry. As this hardwarewas released after our study concluded, the HearX Premiumwas not tested during our pilot. This study has establishedthat CHW-based hearing screening is feasible; however, fur-ther testing should be completed regarding the efficacy of
newer alternate mobile audiology platforms.
Establishing the efficacy of a CHW to gather basic objec-
tive audiologic and otoscopic data can have a significantimpact on the number of patients an otolaryngologist in a low-resourced setting can treat. In t hese settings, audiologists are
even more rare than otolaryngologists, which makes audio-grams very valuable. Adding reliable audiograms and oto-scopic data to a patient’s char t prior to an initial visit with an
otolaryngologist can allow a provider to appropriately screen
patients to increase the likelihood of identifying patients withsurgically treatable pathology. Therefore, a CHW-based hear-ing screening program can sign ificantly augment an otolaryn-
gologist practicing in a low- and middle-income country.
Otolaryngology in LMICs has 2 main players: local oto-
laryngologists and international otolaryngologists who par-ticipate in surgical and educational service work.
Telemedicine programs such as this can bridge the gap
between these 2 groups. Future implications include theability for surgical mission trips to understand the pathologyof the patients they will treat prior to their arrival. In addi-tion, this program will allow local otolaryngologists to com-municate with international surgeons regarding questionsthat may emerge during postsurgical follow-up. This pro-gram will need to be trialed in other countries prior to
broader conclusions being drawn about the use of CHW-
centered telemedicine in otolaryngology.
Conclusion
This study highlights the utility of a CHW-based screeningtool to identify and document audiometric evaluations and
otologic endoscopic examinations. The combination of these
2 objective measures may identify candidates for hearing
