ICT FOR CLTS : A LANDSCAPE A SSESSMENT – AUGUST  2018 v PREFACE  
USAID’s Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Partnerships and Learning for Sustainability (WASHPaLS) 
project is a 5 -year task order awarded to Tetra Tech on 16 Septemb er 2016 under USAID’s Water and 
Development Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract (WADI). Tetra Tech implements the 
project in collaboration with several non -governmental organizations and small -business partners — 
Aquaya Institute, Family Health  International (FHI 360), FSG, and Iris Group —that contribute expertise 
in state -of-the-art WASH programming and research. Distinguished academics, practitioners, and policy 
makers from across the WASH sector regularly provide expert perspectives to the pr oject through an 
internal research working group and an external Advisory Board.  
The project  supports the Agency’s goal of reducing morbidity and mortality in children under five as part 
of the Ending Preventable Child and Maternal Deaths initiative by ens uring USAID programming employs 
high-impact, evidence -based environmental health and WASH interventions. The project identifies and 
shares best practices for achieving sustainability, scale, and impact by generating evidence to support the 
reduction of ope n defecation and movement of communities up the sanitation ladder while also focusing 
on novel approaches for reducing feces exposure to infants and young children (IYC). Specifically, the 
project:  
1.    offers USAID missions and technical bureaus ready access t o thought leaders and analytical 
expertise across a wide range of WASH themes in response to their needs (Component 1);  
2.    generates evidence through implementation research to increase the sector’s understanding of and 
approaches to sustainable WASH services , the effectiveness of behavioral and market -oriented 
approaches to sanitation, and measures to disrupt pathways of fecal exposure to infants and young 
children (Component 2); and  
3.    administers a small grants program on innovations in hygiene behavior change (Component 3); and  
4.    engages and partners with national and global stakeholders to promote the use and application of 
project -generated evidence and global best practices by practitioners and policy makers, tapping into 
broad coalitions and dynamic partner ships (Component 4).  
Among the project’s initial tasks is the production and dissemination of three in -depth desk reviews 
focusing on community -led total sanitation (CLTS), market -based approaches for sanitation, an d hygienic 
environments for IYC, as well as this landscape assessment on the utilization of information and 
communication technology ( ICT) to support CLTS implementation.    
ICT FOR CLTS : A LANDSCAPE A SSESSMENT – AUGUST  2018 vi EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
Community -led total sanitation (CLTS) has been adopted as national policy for rural sanitation in over 
20 countries, yet considerable challenges remain with respect to consistent, high -quality implementation 
and reliable monitoring.  
The USAID Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Partnerships and Learning for Sustainability (WASHPaLS) 
Project carried out this landscape assessment of information communication technology (ICT) use cases 
in the water, sanitation , and hygiene (WASH) sector as an initial step toward understanding the demand 
and potential use for development or customization of a technology solution to support large -scale 
implementation and/or monitoring of CLTS  programs. The purposes of the assessment are to : 1) 
understand how mobile -enabled ICTs are currently being used in WASH programming generally and 
CLTS programming in particular; 2) document lessons l earned and opportunities for ICTs to support 
both monitoring and implementation of CLTS; and 3) provide insights into the overall process of 
developing or adapting a ICT solution to the needs of CLTS implementers, governments and 
communities practicing CLT S.  
The assessment team’s  review of 25 mainly WASH -focused ICT tools suggests that few implementers 
are currently leveraging ICTs as a support tool for CLTS implementation, and , interestingly, the team  did 
not uncover expressed demand to fill that gap. Rat her, ICT solutions in rural sanitation are generally 
employed to enhance program -specific monitoring, or, less frequently, to contribute to national -level 
observation and reporting.  However, over the past 15 years , there has been a proliferation of ICT 
solutions used by water service providers, regulators, and researchers for such diverse purposes as 
tracking water usage, managing user billing and tariff collection, and mapping water system 
infrastr ucture, among other functions.  The team examine d factors re levant to the customization of an 
ICT solution for CLTS implementation and monitoring, looking past the specific ICT solution alone to 
include elements of a broader ICT approach. These include the specific features of a mobile solution 
(i.e., mobile -to-web, mapping, digital data collection forms, messaging, and smartphone apps), financial 
models (i.e.,  off-the-shelf, software -as-a-service, implementation partnership), and a user -centered 
approach to the development and implementation of the ICT tool itself.   
Case studies of the use and effectiveness of ICTs in sanitation programs, particularly CLTS, are rare with 
limited documentation. Based on experiences from the health sector, certain aspects of CLTS 
implementation (e.g., enhanced facilitation of triggeri ng events or reinforcement of behavior change ) may 
be ripe for application of ICT. Examples of ICT -enabled monitoring of output -based aid projects in the 
WASH sector and the gradual expansion of national information management systems may provide 
opportuni ties to leverage ICTs in CLTS and related and complementary programs, especially with regard 
to establishing standards for data management and best practices when integrating any subset of 
available ICT functionality.   
Following the best practices laid out  in the Principles for Digital Development, which were developed via 
consensus by a group of donors and multilateral organizations in 2012 and endorsed by USAID in 2015, 
this review concludes that any expressed or latent demand for an ICT tool to enhance C LTS 
programming is best met by customizing one of the many existing a nd field -tested ICT solutions.  Given 
the varied nature of national CLTS programs, any solution should be developed through a user -centered 
design approach with the implementing institutio ns and integrated into the overall technical approach to 
CLTS implementation, preferably with full engagement by national governments. Long -term uptake of 
any tool requires either a viable commercial distribution model or a host institution to provide ongo ing 
support between funding cycles, responsible for engaging the community of practice and responding to 
the changing technological environment and evolving understanding of CLTS implementation.   
ICT FOR CLTS : A LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT –  AUGUST  2018 1 1.0  INTRODUCTION  
1.1 PURPOSE  
As part of its action research  agenda related to community -led total sanitation (CLTS) , the USAID 
Water, Sanitation , and Hygiene Partnerships and Learning for Sustainability ( USAID/ WASHPaLS) Project 
carried out a  review of information and communication t echnology (ICT) use cases  in the water, 
sanitation , and hygiene (WASH) sector  as a preliminary step to understanding the demand and  potential 
for a technology solution  to support CLTS implementation at national scale s. The original purposes of 
the assessment were  to: 1) understand how mo bile-enabled ICTs are currently being used in WASH 
programming generally and CLTS programming in particular; 2) document lessons learned and 
opportunities for customization of a mobile -enabled , web-based tool to support implementation of 
CLTS ; and 3) provi de insights to guide future research toward  developing  or adapting an ICT solution 
relevant to the needs of CLTS implementers, governments , and communities practicing CLTS .  
Building on  recent global WASH  and ICT  assessments  (Ndaw, 2015 ; Prat & Trémolet, 2013; Hutchings 
et al., 2012 ), this assessment takes a fresh look at the practice  of ICT in WASH with a focus  on feature s 
of ICT solutions that may be applicable to CLTS.  Findings and recommendations on  the technology 
features and design approach of successful ICT solutions  are based largely on a comparative analysis of 
25 ICT solutions  from across international development  practice through the lens of application to 
national CLTS programs .  
1.2 METHODOLOGY  
This assessment include d a broad scan  of relevant academic and grey literature  from across global 
development  practice,  with a more 
focused review  of documentation of 
ICT use in the WASH sector . Desk 
research identified several previous 
global  ICT WASH  assessments and 
plentiful case studies from other 
development sectors documenting 
features of existing digital tools, user 
experiences with them, and evidence of 
uptake b eyond the pilot phase of 
deployments.  Figure 1 illustrates the 
process used to identify  and ultimately 
select  the 25  WASH -specific  tools used 
as the basis of discussion for much of this review. One of our central outputs, presented in Annex D, is 
a taxonom y of these tools across 1 2 categories (e.g., hardware /software,  operating system, donor, 
implementer, cost model , sector, and scale ). A full bibliography  of referenced literature is included in 
Annex A , and further relevant reading is included in Annex B .  
Through follow -up consultati ons with leading  CLTS implementers and ICT developers , the team  
triangulated finding s from the desk study and highlighted lessons learned and opportunities for leveraging 
local systems to drive adoption and scale  of ICT solutio ns. The assessment team conducted i nterviews 
with representatives from UNICEF, WaterAid, SNV Uganda, Thrive Networks , Akros, Akvo,  Kenya 
Water for Health Organization , and mWater  (Annex C contains a full list of interviewees ).

This assess ment  begins in Section 2 with an overview of the state of ICT in international development 
practice, considering the context, common challenges, best practices, and evidence for impact. Section 3 
examines experience with ICT tools in WASH programs and high lights the features or components of 
mobile technology, financing models, and such “soft” approaches to ICT development and 
implementation as user -centered and iterative design . Building on the  specific use cases from ICT in 
WASH presented in Section 3, Section 4 identifies  lessons learned and best practices to be considered 
when customizing a tool to support CLTS implementation. Section 4 also examines current applications 
of ICT in CLTS programs, revealing a heavy focus on program monitoring and highlight ing untapped 
potential for 1) information -sharing to support long -term behavior change and 2) creation of feedback 
loops to increase the value of monitoring data with key stakeholders . Section 5 presents conclusions , 
and the annexes provide additional deta ils as referenced above .   
ICT FOR CLTS : A LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT –  AUGUST  2018 3 2.0 STATE OF ICT IN GLOBAL 
DEVELOPMENT  
2.1 CONTEXT  
Most of the ICT platforms cited in this report are primarily (but not exclusively) based on mobile phone 
technology. The u se of mobile phones  has become ubiquitous across the glo be, with two -thirds of the 
world’s population  in possession of a mobile subscription at the end of 2016 (GSMA, 2017) . Internet 
access via mobile device or smartphone  has grown dramatically in recent years , and forecast s predict 
that levels will reach 60  percent  of the global population by 2020.  As shown in Figure 2, a lthough sub -
Saharan Africa is expected to continue lagging in terms of subscriber penetration  (predicted to reach  50 
percent  only by the end of the decade ), the region is expected to see a 27  percent  spike in smartphone 
adoption by 2020  (GSMA, 2017) .  
Figure 2: Mobile and Internet Coverage in Asia and Africa, 2016 –2020 
 
Adapted from GSMA,  2017. © GSM Association 2017.  
The increased use of  mobile phones and internet  
penetration  have resulted in a proliferation of ICT  
solutions to connect individuals to each ot her as well 
as to services  (see Box 1) . These  also afford  an 
enormous opportunity in global development . 
Compared to paper -based data collection and 
reporting, ICT  tools improve the efficiency  and 
quality  of collecting, transferring, and managing data,  
and support  added functionalities , such as  time-
stamps and geo -referencin g that are generally absent 
in traditional data collection and processing 
Box 1: What is Information and 
Communication Technology (ICT)?  
ICT is an umbrella term that includes any technology 
used to communicate, create, access, disseminate, 
store,  manage, and manipulate information. In broad 
terms, ICTs allow data to be collected electronically 
using a mobile device, input wirelessly into a data 
management system, and accessed either on - or off-
line for analysis and reporting.  
  
ICT FOR CLTS : A LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT –  AUGUST  2018 4 protocols. Digitally collated and stored information can be easily shared with a broad range of 
stakeholders, fr om policy makers and regulators to implementing organizations and even  community 
members, thereby improving transparency  and accountability.  
Indeed, ICT solution s have been increasingly valuable for implementing and monitoring development 
programs for the  past decade. The global health sector has been at the forefront of the creation of ICT 
solutions for international development. Most of the peer -reviewed literature that the team surveyed 
for this assessment, including impact evaluations  of the use of ICT  in developing country contexts, 
comes from the field of mobile health ( mHealth ). A myriad of mobile phone applications ( known as 
“mApps,” or simply  “apps”) are utilized  across sectors including agriculture and rural development 
(mARD) , education ( mLearnin g), finance ( mTransactions, mBanking), governance ( mGovernance), and 
health ( mHealth ) (Hellström, 2010) . The market and product landscape continue to grow . However, 
despite t he increasing penet ration of ICT solutions in the WASH sector , the body of relevant 
document ation on these  experiences is still maturing , and there are few peer -reviewed publications 
demonstrating impact . 
2.2 COMMON  CHALLENGES  WITH ICT  IN THE DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT  
While ICT  solution s hold great potential  to accelerate development outcomes , the team  located  few 
examples of long -term public  sector  uptake of ICT solutions  introduced through donor -funded 
development projects .1 In addition to a general need for greater coordination  between developers of 
ICT solutions and government delivery systems , the literature highlights  both limited local capacity and 
the inability to cover recurrent costs as common barriers to the ir successful implementation and long -
term uptake in resource -constrained environments.  
In many cases,  there is  limited local capacity  for using and managing ICT solutions , particularly in the 
public sector . While technology hubs are growing in parts of East Africa, South  Asia, and Southeast Asia, 
low rates of technolo gical l iteracy and experience with ICT  are still the norm in most developing 
countries , particularly outside of large urban centers  (GSMA , 2016) . According to a consumer survey  
conducted by GSMA  in 2016, 38  percent  of respondents in sub -Saharan Africa high lighted lack of digital 
skills as the biggest barrier to mobile internet adoption (GSMA, 2016) . Rates of technology literacy and 
mobile ownership or control are also distribute d unevenly across men and women  and across age 
groups. Woman in low - and middle -income coun tries are, on average, 10  percent  less likely to own a 
mobile phone than men and 26  percent  less likely to use mobile internet, but disparities also vary widely 
depending on geography (GSMA, 2018) .  
Secondly, e xperience suggests the true costs of maintaining ICT solutions  indefinitely in a development 
context are often insufficiently considered in the design stage , or else are not addressed beyond the life 
of project implementation  (Ndaw, 2015) . Table 1 illustrates direct and indirect cos t and benefit  streams 
that should be considered when planning for long -term uptake of an ICT tool  in the urban water sector  
(GIZ, 2011) . Limited timeframes for ICT initiatives or short -term funding  cycles coupled with the 
absenc e of accurate cost forecasts  for maintenance  or scaling the solutions  often result s in the 
proliferation of on e-off development and testing  of ICT solution s for a specific use case that perform for 
a brief time  and become obsolete  once funding expires  – a condition known as “pi lotitis ” (Ndaw, 2015 ).  
                                                           
1 ICT-enabled solutions in the financial sector (e.g., M -Pesa) have transformed economies but are largely driven by private -
sector interests and investment. ICT use in the financial services industry is beyo nd the scope of this review.   
ICT FOR CLTS : A LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT –  AUGUST  2018 5 Compounding these 
challenges, development 
practitioners have  a poor 
track record of 
coordinating  and aligning  
ICT pilots  with broader 
public -sector -driven 
development  initiatives . In 
Uganda for example , 
excel lent nationwide 
internet  connectivity 
attracted a proliferation of 
pilot-scale, mHealth  
projects in the early 
2010s . In 2012 the 
Ministry of Health issued 
an abrupt  moratorium on 
such investments , citing 
concerns about 
sustainability and 
ownership of the 
technologies, alignment 
with national public health institutional structures, and interoperability of the ICT solution and the 
national District Health Information System ( DHIS2 ) database (McCann, 2012) . In 2013,  the Ministry 
buttressed its national ICT policy with health -sector -specific language developed  through a  participatory 
process.  Stakehold ers included  representatives from the health  and ICT sector s, relevant government 
ministries, health development partners , United Nations (UN) a gencies, the private sector, civil society 
and research organizations , local governments, academics , health serv ice providers, and public sector 
administrators from urban and rural and areas (Omaswa, 2013) .  
2.3 BEST PRACTICES  
Developed via consensus by a group of donors and multilateral 
organizations in 2012, and building on previous efforts (UNICEF’s 
Innovation Pri nciples of 2009, the mHealth Greentree Principles of 
2010, the UK’s Government Design Services Digital Principles, and the 
World Ban k Open Development Principles),  the nine principles for 
digital development  (listed in Figure 3 and expanded upon in Annex E)  
embody lessons  learned, best practices, and standards for the use of 
technologies on international development projects. The principles 
provide guidance to  ensure that ICT solutions are fit -for-purpose, cost  
effective , and ultimately sustainable . USAID f ormally endorsed them in 
2015. The Global Digital Health Network, co -chaired by USAID, 
provides leadership in applying the principles in the fields of digital 
health ( mHealth , e-Health, and ICTs) and offers a collaborative 
gathering space for members to sh are perspectives, resources, and 
practical guidance related to implementation across a range of technical 
areas.  
This review examines how  the principles have (or have not ) been 
employed in practice , as well as their relevance to the  impact and  Figure 3: The Principles for Digital

when determining the appropriateness and sustainability of an ICT tool for CLTS.  
2.4 EVIDENCE FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF  ICT IN DEVELOPMENT  
While the potential for ICT solutions in development contexts is  well documented, the evidence linking 
the use of technology to accelerated development outcomes is not. A 2013 review concluded that 
mHealth  interventions lack a foundation of basic evidence, let alone  room for  eviden ce-based scal ing up 
(Tomlinson  et al., 2013) . A 2017 assess ment of  320 impact evaluations and seven systematic reviews on 
science, technology, innovation, and partnership (STIP) interventions in low - and middle -income 
countrie s resulted in an evidence gap map for STIP in global development programming  (Sabet  et al., 
2017) .2 Roughly four in 10  studies covered  mHealth  interven tions, but only two  were related to  WASH , 
and ICTs were not disaggregated. Furthermore, the report identifie d high-priority knowledge gaps for 
future impact evalu ations . These included  digital infrastructure development, digital inclusion for 
vulnerable or marginalized populations, data systems development, community - and society- level 
outcomes, and cost analyses.  
The assessment team identified a single  impact stu dy on ICT and WASH  (Markle et al ., 2017)  that 
reported significant benefits , but whose methodo logical rigor raises some questions ( this study is 
considered in more detail  in Section 3). The team conclude d that additional research and documentation 
are required to understand better the impacts  that ICT solutions  are having within the WASH sector 
and the development context wri t large .  
  
                                                           
2 None of the 320 studies were randomized control trials (RCTs). Since the speed of technological development may 
outpace the timeli ne of publishing results from an RCT, other validation methods have been proposed such as continuous 
evaluation of evolving interventions  (particularly applicable for behavior change interventions in mHealth  that rely on a 
constant stream of input from sen sors) (Mohr et al., 2013) .   
ICT FOR CLTS : A LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT –  AUGUST  2018 7 3.0 CONSIDERATIONS FOR AN ICT TOOL 
TO SUPPORT CLTS  
3.1 OVERVIEW OF ICT IN W ASH  
Over the past 15 years , water service prov iders, regulators, and researchers have used a proliferation of 
ICT solutions for such diverse purposes as tracking water usage, managing user billing and tariff 
collection, and mapping water system infrastructure. Previous assessments have categorized WAS H-
specific ICTs in different ways. One  examined ten “ mWASH” solutions (out of 40 identified) with 
respect to service access, post -construction failure, and reliability, noting untapped potential for use in 
long-term monitoring and planning (Hutchings et al., 2012) . In a review of solutions developed 
specifically for the sanitation sector , Prat and Trémolet (2013)  group ed tools into four categories by 
function: self- reporting of maintenance needs, mapping of infrastructure and needs, monitoring of 
sanitation programs, and education for behavioral change. Several  of the tools  evaluated  were developed 
as part of the “ Sanitation Hackathon ,” a two -day event hosted by the World Bank in December 2012 
that brought together local sanitation experts and software developers to build technology solutions to  
address sanitation challenges around the world. In the months following the hackathon , hundreds of 
participants went on to participate in the “ Sanitation App Challenge ” where they continued to develop 
and iterate on their initial designs  (Irigoyen, 2013) . This analysis contains s everal of the finalist solutions 
from this World Bank activity to demonstrate lessons learned or functionalities that may be 
incorporated into an ICT tool for CL TS. A 2015 desk review of ICTs in the WASH sector , conducted 
by the World Bank Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) , grouped 23 tools into three main functional 
areas: increasing access, improving service delivery, and improving governance  (see Box 2 ). The s ame 
study compared ICT  solution s across the agriculture, health, education, and governance  sectors, 
outlining the opportunities, key barriers, and lessons learned (see Annex F ) (Ndaw, 2015 ). Our analysis  
and recommendations  have taken these factors into co nsideration . 
 
Emerging research and development on the use of sensors for continuous collection and transmission of 
WASH monitoring data is also worthy of attention. Some early attempts to apply wireless monitoring to  
rural water suppl ies in less -industri alized economies have been documented (Thomas et al., 2016; 
Thomas et al., 2013) , but the cost and sustainability of required hard ware limit scalability  somewhat . 
Nevertheless, t he US -based NGO c harity:  water has managed the development  of a wireless flow Box 2: Uses of ICTs in WASH  
Some examples of WASH -specific applications for ICTs include:  
• Measure performance and progress  
• Identify marginalized areas and present data visually to highli ght equity issues  
• Improve governance through availability of reliable data and kn owledge of actual customer base 
• Allow improved access to information by stakeholders fo r improv ed planning and decision- making  
• Design improvement strategies  
• Indicate the distance required to the nearest improved water source 
• Identify advocacy themes  
• Prioritize intervention areas and better target a vailable and limited resources  
• Improve the q uality and evaluation of funding proposals  
• Promote increased investment in the sector  (which can translate into more people served)  
• Quantify  actual service need levels  
• Monitor water quality  
(Ndaw, 2015)

supply systems  (see Figure 4) . The device , put in place at a cost of roughly $100 per unit, is now in 
operation in over 3,000 handpumps in Ethiopia, transmitting flow data in real  time via General Packet 
Radio Service (C. Gorder, personal communication , July 24, 2017).  
Figure 4: charity: water Sensor Output, Afridev Sensor, and Tap Sensor

Other sensor products for real -time monitoring of flow rates from hand pump and other parameters 
are being developed. USAID has recently deployed sensors  to monitor electrically powered borehole  
pumps  supported by its projects in Kenya and Ethiopia (Thomas  et al., 2018) . In the sanitation space, the 
Passive Use Latrine Monitor (PLUM) sensor, which detects warm -body movement in a latrine stall 
(ideally , a household la trine), has been applied in a research setting in Bangladesh . Results support 
concerns that self -reporting of latrine use  provides an over -estimate of actual use (Delea et al., 2017) .  
3.2 INTRODUCTION TO CLTS  
CLTS is a community mobilization technique 
designed to eliminate open defecation. Developed 
initially in 1999, it has now been implemented in 
over 60 countries and incorporated into national 
sanitation policies in at least 20 .3 The approach 
relies on a f aith in local collective action:  “By raising 
awareness that as long as even a minority continue s 
to defecate in the open,  everyone is at risk of 
disease, CLTS triggers the community’s desire for 
collective change, propels people into action , and 
encourages innovation, mutual support , and 
appropriate local solutions” (CLTS Knowledge Hub, 
2016) . Figure 5 represents the key milestones and 
activities for implementing  CLTS at the community 
level. 
                                                           
3 For more on CLTS, see Ch ambers  (2016) and Kar & Chambers (2008)  and additional references in Annex B.  
Box 3: What is  CLTS ? 
“CLTS represents a dramatic paradigm shift away 
from centralized, top -down measures  for addressing 
open defecation. R ather than delivering hardware, 
subsidizing construction or other financial or in- kind 
inputs, or prescribing particular designs or models 
that may not be locally available, CLTS is design  
neutral and is receptive to very  low-cost installations, 
including rudimentary pit l atrines  designed by 
community members and made of local materials. It is 
an approach that explicitly targets the whole 
community rather than individual households, and is 
shaped by previous difficulties encountered when 
subsidies or free provision had been introduced in the 
absence of local demand for toilets and/or r ecognition 
of the dangers of open defecation. ” (USAID, 2018)  
  
ICT FOR CLTS : A LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT –  AUGUST  2018 9 Figure 5: Key Steps of CLTS Approach  
 
CLTS implementers  have modified and adapted the methodology as it has spread across the globe. A 
recent review of CLTS (USAID, 2018)  found significant variation s in what defines an open defecation -
free (ODF) community  and modalities for  CLTS  implementation . Likewise, there is no consensus on 
optimal performance parameters and on how, by whom, and with  what frequency those parameters 
should be measured . In addition,  when parameters are actually measured, they often lack both internal 
and external validity (USAID, 2018) . The same report indicate d a lack of reliable informati on on CLTS 
performance as it relate s to reduction of open defecation (OD) and latrine adoption. A challenge to 
continued performance monitoring and data collection of CLTS outcomes is the cost of doing so, even 
though  these  activities are necessary to unde rstand and sustain results of CLTS programming ( USAID , 
2018) . 
The incorporation of ICT tools to overcome common barriers experienced in  CLTS programs is worth 
exploring, given the current scale of CLTS adoption and the possibility that it will remain  at the 
forefront of rural sanitation programming through the end of the current Sustainable Development Goal 
(SDG) era. Roughly three -quarters of the global population without access to an improved sanitation 
facility live in areas covered by cellular network s, affording CLTS implementers and governments 
working in these areas access to modern means of communication , data collection , and data- sharing that 
could assist in  CLTS execution and  monitoring and the promotion of  lasting behavior change . These 
opportunit ies are discussed further in Section 4.2. 
3.3 LESSONS FROM ICT USE  CASES – A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS   
This section presents a comparative analysis conducted by the assessment team of 25 ICT solutions  
developed for the WASH sector  (see Annex D) by considering two  attribute categories : mobile 
technology features and  financial models. The section concludes with a brief discussion of the 
importance of user-centered design in development and implementation of ICT solutions . 
3.3.1 Mobile Technology Features  
The usability and efficacy of a given mobile technology are driven largely by its feature array. For 
example, tools developed with advanced features such as a smartphone app  would go unused in 
contexts where smartphones are uncommon; a  text-heavy information delivery tool would be 
ineffective in communities with high illiteracy rates. Table 2 summarizes the mobile features  that are 
utilized by a selection of the 25 ICT  solutions presented in Annex D, in five categories: mobile -to-web 
(M2W), mapping, e -forms, push m essaging, and smartphone applications.  M2W indicates that m obile 
data collection tools (cell phones or tablets) are i ntegrated with web -based platforms to collect and 
present data visually. Spatial data collection and visualization in map form are  widely u sed to display the 
status of infrastructure and services and the reach of WASH programs . Digital forms (e -forms) allow 
data to be keyed directly into a mobile device, eliminating the use of paper forms . “Push” messaging  
actively returns information to the user, allowing the creation of a feedback loop  (discussed further 
below) . Smartphone applications can provide a packaged solution that seamlessly incorporate s these and 
other functionalities in a single operating space . Each of these features is discussed further in the 
following sections.

Box 4 presents the three fundamental building blocks of these solutions, including d escriptions of 
hardware and software used to collect and transmit information over cellular networks and broad 
categories of methods to disseminate, visualize , and analyze the information collected.   
 
 Box 4: Building Blocks of ICT Solutions Used in WASH  
Data collection hardware:  
• Basic phones  are easy to access but are limited to short message service ( simple short message service 
[SMS],  or text messaging) and voice services.  
• Feature phones  can accommodate some custom utilities such as DHIS2 and other Java -based applications, 
which are less complex than smartphone applications.  
• Smartphones and tablets  have sophisticated features such as mobile applications ( i.e., software that runs 
similarly on a smart device as it does on a com puter) and links to cloud -based services.  
 
Data collection software:   
• SMS data entry, interactive SMS that include s question and response features or surveys, native forms on 
feature phones, smartphone applications with digital forms, interactive voice response (IVR), geolocation 
features, and image capture.  
 
Data dissemination, visualization , and analytics :  
• Web-based dashboards, web -based  mapping, broadcasting or bulk SMS, interactive mobile communication, 
simple S MS, and other reports and data formats like interactive graphics, photos, or videos.  
 
  
ICT FOR CLTS : A LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT –  AUGUST  2018 11 Connectivity – M2W  Solutions . A number of mobile solu tions used for data collection are paired 
with a web -based platform for reporting and monitoring  (i.e., a dashboard ). Examples include  Akvo 
Flow, mWater  and M4W. Whether entries  are automatically added to the online database  immediately 
upon collection, or  uploaded after a time lag, the ability to view  data through the internet opens  many 
possibilities for its use . Among the solutions surveyed , online dashboards are a common trend , matching 
the growing interest in  data-driven  adaptive management. Practition ers have begun to  use dashboards to 
track communities’ progress ion toward sanitation goals, monitor urban water consumption, conduct 
spatial analysis of OD sites, track consumer -reported issues at  water points, and more . Box 5 describes 
the M2W solution (D HIS2) in Zambia  and how it enabled and motivated local leaders to promote CLTS 
better by leveraging access to centralized data.   
 
Mapping – Spatial Data Collection for Visualization and Reporting . Spatial data collection and 
visualization  are widely used to display the status of infrastructure and services including the mapping of 
water point location s. These functions help utilities improve services by tracking and responding to 
issues  throughout the network as well as  at water  distribution  points  where d elivery is not to a 
household connection (like public stand posts  or kiosks) . Most of the ICT solutions  surveyed  in this 
review  utilize  smartphones or tablets —devices that automatically record geographic coordinates  and 
match the coordinates to data points  collected with the device (a process known as “ geotagging” ). With 
geo-position ing features now standard on many phones, m ap production from mobile spatial data  does 
not require  an integrated  mobile applicatio n; geographic coordinates are coupled with data point entries 
and can be mapped using any number of proprietary or open sourc e geographic information system  
(GIS) software applications . For example, CLTS Mapper , piloted by People in Need  in Angola , used 
dedicated  global positioning system ( GPS) units to capture the coordinates of village latrines and zones  
of OD; data were transferred by directly connecting the GPS units to a computer , and results were 
visualiz ed using Google Earth (Singh et al., 2012) . Contrast this to the custom interactive map s available 
through Akvo  Lumen, Akvo’s tool to integrate data collected using Akvo Flow and other sources for 
analysi s, visualization, and sharing. Figure 6 shows water point functionality in Sierra Leone, with water 
points color coded by status and linked  to photographs and additional details of each data point  
(Akvolumen, 2017) .  
CLTS triggering events often begin with a participatory defecation mapping exercise to identify open 
defecation zones and households with or without sanitation facilities . Such maps are generally hand -
drawn or even laid out using symbols on bare ground. One possible application of  spatial data collection  
capabilities of  smart phones or tablets  is this mapping component of the triggering event,  enabling 
implementers to  better understand the dynamics  of post -triggering behavior change by  more easily Box 5: M2W/DHIS2 Supporting the  Zambia n National CLTS Program  
In the Chiengi District of Zambia, Akros (a Zambia- based development consultancy and implementing NGO) 
used DHIS2, a locally recognized , feature phone application, to collect data regularly on CLTS implementation 
and outcomes and to transmit the data to a central database for compilation and analysis. Village chiefs in the 
district were later provided with tablets to monitor the progress of villag es in their traditional jurisdictions in 
reaching ODF status. Chiefs could review data through user-friendly graphs to identify and prioritize areas 
requiring follow -up or reinforcement. A chievement of the eventual district -wide ODF certification is 
report edly largely due to  chiefs having access to the information necessary to motivate communities and 
encourage behavior change . A reported increase in ODF -certified chiefdoms in Zambia followed the Chiengi 
certification process, potentially  attributed to the amount of publicity and praise that Chiengi received for its 
achievement (Zimba et al., 2016) . Akros recently transferred the  M2W system to the newly  created Ministry of 
Water  Development Sanitation and Environmental Protection , which will serve as the institutional home for 
this national-level tool to support CLTS impl ementation.   
ICT FOR CLTS : A LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT –  AUGUST  2018 12 mapping the progress of CLTS program outcomes both within individual triggered villages and across a 
wider geographic area. W here mobile devices are less viable , the conversion (digitizing of  manual 
mapping outputs  to digital map products ) over time could  also help to visualize  progress.

Digital Data Collection Forms  (e-Forms) . The use of d igital data collection in global development 
to streamline the lengthy  and expensive process of paper -based surveying and reporting  is increasing . 
Electronic forms (e -forms) can greatly improve the accuracy of data input , reducing t he likelihood of 
user error through features such as  multiple -choice  fields, drop-down options, and automatic data 
validation checks.  Using s tandard ized field inputs  based on explicitly defined terms  can reduce mistakes 
such as spelling errors and mis use o f terms. Digital data collection substantially improves the  speed of 
data collection, transfer, and validation , and leverages computing power to calculate timelines and 
capture GPS coordinates  automatically . Data can be wirelessly uploaded to the internet , with the option 
to perform data quality checks  and aggregation at the same time . When  integrated with a web -based 
platform or mobile application, data input from the field can be automatically visualized to provide 
instant  feedback to the person providing  the data. mWater ’s platform , for example, features 
customizable e -forms, that are accessible through its mobile app , mWater Surveyor , (see Box 6) 
(MWater, n.d.) .  
 
ICT FOR CLTS : A LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT –  AUGUST  2018 13  
CLTS implementers  and governments  can use e -forms to improve the accuracy and speed of recording  
triggering event outputs (e.g., number of attendees, facilitation elements employed , results, baseline OD 
numbers, and action plan s) and outcome s (e.g., changes in OD  or toilets c onstructed) . Some amount of 
paper data collection of household -level information will likely still be necessary due to limited access to 
devices  and poor wireless connectivity.  Combin ing data collection methods  can help;  hard copy forms 
may serve as the fi rst step of data collection , after which the data  can be upload ed to an electronic 
information management system. Akros implemented t his stepwise approach using the DHIS2 data 
collection application for the CLTS program in Zambia (Zimba et al., 2016) , as did East Meets West  
(EMW) for the Community Hygiene Output -Based Aid (CHOBA) program in Vietnam and Cambodia 
(H. Nguyen & G. Davis, personal communication, April 12, 2017) , both described in Section 4. The 
process of transferring data from a  paper form to a digital platform  provides  staff with an opportunity 
for quality control , but it is admittedly  more time -intensive  than direct digital input , and indeed every 
stage of data entry or digitization  contains some risk of manual transcription error .  
Information Exchange and Feedback Loops – SMS, IVR , and Push/Pull  Messaging . Mobile 
messaging can be used  to collect , or “pull,” information and to share , or “push, ” information. Box 7 
outlines the different types of mobile messaging and their uses . Common push messaging methods 
include  text mes sages  (also known as SMS ), voice messaging, and  notifications delivered through a 
smartphone app. The assessment team identified f ew cases from the WASH sector to demonstrat e the 
use of push- data features to deliver information on programs or to create fee dback loops with 
beneficiaries and partners, but examples exist in the  mHealth  sector .  
 
The mHealth  sector has documented successes using SMS messages as a nudge to support behavior 
change  (Lee et al . 2016)  conducted a systematic review of effectiveness studies of mHealth  interventions 
for maternal, newborn, and child health in low - and middle -income countries, and found that Box 6: The mWater Suite  
mWater is an innovative ICT provider in the WASH sector who has developed a suite of tools used most 
often by utilities to  monitor service quality at water points . mWater ’s application s are open source with no 
usage fees and are available both as a web -based platform and a mobile application on Android devices. The 
tool’s components and features include:  integration with the mWater test kit to measure contamination in 
water samples; the  mWater Surveyor mobile application to conduct surveys and export data to a web -based 
platform ; the mWater Explorer mobile application (a “lighter -weight” mobile application built specifically to 
collect and share data in low -bandwidth contexts and to be i nteroperable with international data -sharing 
initiatives); and the mWater Portal, a web -based platform that integrate s information and  spatial data for 
mapping and visualizing water data collected using the suite of mWater tools . The integration of multiple 
components (mobile and web -based) into a single platform makes mWater a flexible ICT solution to support 
implementation and monitoring of WASH services in a variety of contexts .  
Box 7: Types of Mobile Messaging  
• Outbound messaging  pushes information out  and is used mostly for dissemination of important 
messages.  
• Inbound messaging  pulls information and is used for polling or surveying.  
• Two -way messaging  both pushes information out and collects information. Two -way messaging can be 
built upon more complex information systems, making it possible to implement surveys with menu systems 
and user choices.  
• Interactive voice response systems (IVR s) are call -in services where users can access or report 
information by responding to voice prompts. C an be used to rea ch illiterate populations.   
ICT FOR CLTS : A LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT –  AUGUST  2018 14 breastfeeding rates within one hour after birth are higher among mothers whose phones receive an SMS 
notification. The analysis also found that groups receiving the notification were significantly more likely 
to exclusively b reastfeed for three to six months after birth. Other studies have shown mixed results, 
but the mHealth  literature generally supports the effectiveness of SMS as a behavior change tool. 
Researchers from the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and International Centre for Diarrhoeal 
Disease Research, Bangladesh  (icddr,b), are currently conducting a second  randomized control trial  
(RCT) to evaluate  the impact of utilizing Mobile Health (mHealth) as a low- cost approach to deliver ing 
WASH messaging as part of the CHoBI7 intervention4. This is the first RCT evaluating the  efficacy of 
sending mHealth messages to households to increase handwashing with soa p and water treatment 
practices  (C. George, personal communication, March 15, 2017) . 
In the WASH sector , the Human Sensor Web (H2.0)  application was designed to enable  comm unity 
members and utility workers in Zanzibar to report on water supply and sanitation coverage using pull 
messaging . Users  were encouraged to  send SMS messages to a toll -free number to report on the 
functionality status of a water point. The reports were aggregate d into a central system , which then 
generate d a mass SMS message to update the community members who ha d registered with the system. 
Water utilities used the system to report solutions back to the community.  This application  effectively 
created a public water service monitoring system using  real-time information driven  by the community’s 
georeferenced inputs. In this case, the data submitted from the community was of good quality, but few 
reports were received. One of the perceived challenges of us ing the system wa s that it only accepted a 
specifically structured SMS message , which was not easily relatable to the local spoken language 
(Hutchings et al., 2012) . So, while the application purposefully incorporated  feedback to water system 
users, it ultimately failed due to insufficient consideration of users’  needs  and constraints  (Principle for 
Digital Development 1). A potential solution to this issue is the use of voice messaging rather than an 
SMS. 
Successful  feedback loops  to empower and engage public health stakeholders in mHealth behavior 
change communication interventions ha ve been documented annually since 2012, with the first mHealth 
Compendium technical report (McQueen et al ., 2012) . Many of the best practices from the health sector  
can be adap ted for WASH. CLTS relies on community engagement to change behaviors,  so feedback 
loops to communities have potential to improve results . Push messages could be used by national and 
sub-national governments to share information with frontline health worke rs or community members. 
The Zambian M2W platform creates a feedback loop by providing ODF status updates to village chiefs 
through the tablets provided to them by the CLTS implementer  (Markle et al., 2017) .  
All-in-one Solution  – Smartphone Applications . Roughly  a third of the ICT tools that the 
assessment team  surveyed  leverage smartphones to provide a more sophisticated solution bundled in 
the form of a n app. Smartphone apps can be complex , with mu ltiple embedded functionalities  such as 
data collection, push notifications, and a document database  (see Box 8, next page ). The effectiveness 
and sustainability of a smartphone app  is a function of the local context , because it  depends on minimum 
levels of internet connectivity, high levels of mobile penetration, and users with skill and facility with 
technology —all of which may vary considerably across areas of CLTS implementation. ICT  tools could 
exclude many potential users at the household level  even as they  facilita te implementation of at-scale 
programs. I ntegrated  features to collect data, review inf ormation and resources, and access reports 
provides the potential for  a digital “ one-stop-shop” for CLTS implementers.

treatment intervention for household members of cholera patients (George et al., 2016) .  
ICT FOR CLTS : A LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT –  AUGUST  2018 15 3.3.2 Financial Consideration  
The financial model that underpins the development and maintenance of an ICT solution is  essential . 
There may be a tension between, on the one hand, higher pricing for hardware, software, and support 
that enables pure commercial viability and, on the other, the imperative to keep options affordable to 
governments and NGO implementers to maintain functionalit y over time without the expectation of 
continuous donor funding. Where there is no clear pure commercial model for an ICT solution, the 
absence of a long -term institutional home that can marshal resources to cover ongoing costs  often 
results in the termina tion of a program following the pilot phase . In addition to up -front development 
costs, which will vary based on the organization’s need to outsource information technology  expertise, 
ongoing costs must be planned for and will include data transmission, ha rdware and software 
maintenance and licensing, and periodic training.  
 
Importantly, ICTs that incorporate mobile messaging must consider the cost of data transmission levied 
by mobile service providers. Software that is not open source may require recurr ing fees for licenses or 
accounts, either on a monthly or annual basis. These fees may be levied per user or on the quantity of 
data generated or collected, both of which may be significant in at -scale programs. Web server hosting 
also requires a recurring  fee and while there are affordable options, the cost again depends on the 
amount of data hosted. Provision of airtime credit is one way to subsidize the cost of sending and 
receiving information via a mobile device , if the managers of the ICT solution wis h to reduce a potential 
barrier to use by individuals . 
Of the 25 tools that the assessment team surveyed, at least five were either  funded  through short -term 
grants or created during the Sanitation H ackathon  to generate novel ideas  to respond to a specific 
development challenge. In these cases,  seed funding was provided to develop and pilot the tool, but 
long-term financing costs and scale d implementation of the tools  were distinctly not  underwritten . The 
2012 Sanitation Hackathon organized by the World Ban k and partners produced three grand prize 
winners : mSchool, Taarifa, and SunClean (“Sanitation App Challenge ,” n.d.). mSchool , developed by 
Manobi S.A. in Senegal, allowed  users to send formatted SM S messages to inform service providers of 
problems with toilet s and water  supply  systems in schools and track the alerts on a web -based platform 
(Manobi, n.d.) . Taarifa, developed by a group of coders during a hackathon  at University College London, 
was a data collection, management, and visualization platform that allows citizens to report issues with 
local government services. Taarifa w as piloted with the Ministry of Local Government in Uganda in 2012  
as an effort to improve systems for the urban poor  (Ilifee, n.d.) . SunClean  was an innovative sanitation Box 8: Drop Drop  
Created by the University of Cape Town in South Africa to help residents track their water consumption, Drop 
Drop is compatible with Android devices  and distributed at no charge via  the Google Play Store. Users track 
their estimated water consumption by viewing reports that are generated from their water bill and made 
available to them through the application on their mobile devices or from the web platform. Users can also 
access resources on water conservation m ethods, information about municipal water systems, and contact 
information for local utilities  using the features available from the smartphone app or the web -based platform . 
Drop Drop was initially piloted in rural communities outside of Cape Town. The de veloper of the Drop Drop 
application, iCOMMS, makes the case that the pilot has demonstrated reduced household water consumption 
compared to historic use patterns and  compared to individuals without access to the tool  since it was launched 
in 2016 (Nkanjeni, 2017) . This could be attributed to the information and knowledge that i s now in the hands of 
local residents. iCOMMS sought to expand the pilot in 2017 by increasing the app’s user base and testing 
additional mechanisms for driving behavior change. The target market for the expanded pilot was intended to be 
middle - to high -income neighborhoods where the majority of residential water consumption occurred (Matroos, 
2017) . At the time of this report, updates of the expanded pilot were unavailable.   
ICT FOR CLTS : A LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT –  AUGUST  2018 16 game developed in Indonesia  to teach children proper sanitation behavior (Ramadhani, n.d.) . All three of 
these tools , while promising and successfully piloted, are now defunct,  demonstrating the  issue of 
“pilotitis,”  a term created initially for the health sector but now used more broadly across the 
development industry to describe frustration with focus on demonstrating successful development 
outcomes from narrowly defined project interventions, typically targeting r elatively small populations 
(Huang  et al., 2017) .  
These examples represent a stark contrast  to that of Kobo Toolbox (Kobo), a widely used ICT solution 
developed for humanitarian crises with an institutional home with the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative 
(HHI). Kobo is funded entirely through grants and donations , and HHI manages its continued 
development and maintenance. Kobo collects no revenue from users of the application,  but HHI has an 
adequate and sustainable source of revenue to maintain customer support, produce upgrades, etc. HHI 
also partners with a committed group of  aid organizations (such as the UN Office for the Coordination 
of Humanitarian Affairs and  the International Rescue Committee [ IRC]) to integrate best practices and 
lessons learned from implementation.  
The underlying financial model for the ICT solutions surveyed fall into th ree categories: self -service 
tools, software -as-a-service (SAAS), and implementation partnership. Each model requires a particular 
level of information technology ( IT) capacity within the implementing organization and has different cost 
implications. Self-service tools are those applied with minimal technical support from the developer. In 
the SAAS model, the implementer relies upon the software developer for some technical support during 
the life of project , while  in the partnership model, the software dev eloper also engages in program 
implementation . Each type is discussed in more detail below.  
Self-service or “ Off-the-Shelf .” Self-service models rely on the implementing organization’s  own 
capabilit ies to customize the Off-the-Shelf software to suit its needs  and may be open -source solutions 
(OSS) or more complex enterprise- level solutions . Pre-tested and ready to use  by a broad audience, 
solutions of this type tend to include a variety of features that are rarely perfectly aligned with the needs 
of any si ngle user . However, since design and maintenance costs can be spread across a wide community 
of users, the price is usually lower. 
OSS is any piece of software for which the raw code is  made publicly available. As  a suite of free OSS 
tools used to collect,  manage, and visualize data,  Kobo is widely used across the humanitarian and 
development sectors, and therefore has a robust community contribut ing to its development and 
documentation.  Implementer s must use the documentation and source code to set up and maintain 
Kobo Toolbox, which requires comparatively advanced technical skills and experience during both setup 
and ongoing usage . Table 3 outlines the advantages and disadvantages of OSS systems.  
Table 3: Open Source Software  
Advant ages Disadvantages  
• Constantly being improved , tested, and updated by 
the community of practice   
• Highly secure , stable, and reliable  
• No recurring licensing costs or up -front purchases  
• Flexible and customizable  • Requires technical expertise to set up and 
maintain 
• Less polished than commercial software 
• Less personalized and on -demand support than 
commercial software  
Enterprise -level solutions usually require a fee, either for a license or for initial setup, due to their 
greater complexity and  additional consi derations important to larger implementing organizations , such 
as security, access controls, and scalability. For example, Magpi  is a commercial  provider of digital data 
collection, mapping , and information management services commonly used in the public h ealth field and 
in emergency settings. Magpi’s ICT solution  offers many of the same features as Kobo but requires a 
monthly fee to cover ongoing technical support . Users can access an online helpdesk or tap into  
ICT FOR CLTS : A LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT –  AUGUST  2018 17 dedicated technical support through a costed  agreement. There is less flexibility to customize the 
features than with Kobo, but the tool comes fully equipped to colle ct, manage, and visualize data.  
Customized Software as a Service . Many software developers in the WASH sector operate 
through a n SAAS model, whereby implementers engage a developer to set up and customize an ICT 
solution (open  source or proprietary) and  provid e ongoing services . Such services may include training 
proje ct staff and other users, creating documentation on the tool and its i ntended use, and providing 
technical support for the tool throughout the term of the agreement.   
mWater and Akvo F low, two of  the largest and most widely used ICT platforms developed specifically 
for WASH, use a version of this model . Both tools are open s ource, so that  implementers can access 
the source code , but organizations  in practice often lack the resources to customize the tool beyond its 
basic features. In an interview, a representative of  Akvo F low indicated  that users rarely choose to use 
the application without technical support and often enter into an agreement with Akvo to establish a 
monitoring and evaluation framework and adapt the tool and data collection features to a given  project’s 
needs  (H. Jewell, personal communication, April 4, 2017) . For a fee, Akvo also offers training and 
provides ongoing technical support.  mWater employs a similar model  but depends more on large, 
multinational institutions to buy into customization and support mechanisms to  cover the ir tools’ 
standard development a nd maintenance costs so they can be used for free by the development 
community  (J. Feighery, personal communication , April 6, 2017) .  
Implementation Partnership. In an implementation partnership, the program implementer work s 
with a software developer in t he design phase of the project to craft an ICT solution specifically for the 
needs of the project, either customizing an existing tool or creating a new tool from scratch.  
In the case of Zambia, discussed earlier, the technology firm Akros partnered with UNICEF  and the 
Ministry of Local Government and  Housing  (MLGH)  to customize DHIS2, an off -the-shelf ICT tool, for 
CLTS program implementation and monitoring, collaborating in the earliest possible phases of the 
project to fully understand user needs, data collection requirements, and the larger ICT landscape  (L. 
Markle, personal communication, March 2, 2017) . Rather than employing Akros staff for data collection, 
the Akros implementation team employed  data collectors from the local community trained  to use 
DHIS2. Akros was also responsible for the customization of  the M2W platform to manage and visualize 
the incoming data , both via a  web-based portal and mobile devices through an app .  
The long-term partnership  between mWater and WaterAid is  a different exam ple of implementation 
partnership,  whereby WaterAid uses the mWater suite of tools in multiple count ries free of cha rge but 
engages frequently with mWater on a fee -for-service basis to customize their  tool for new uses  or to 
improve functionality of an exi sting platform. WaterAid, along with other such organi zations as 
Water.org , provides funding to mWater to develop new features , which are then available for use in the 
sector —with the goal that these tools will be  adopted widely to support the SDG monitori ng process.  
3.3.3 A User-Centered Approach to ICT Development and Implementation  
Applying the first Principle of Digital Development  (design with the user ) during the design, 
development, and implementation phases will enhance the sustainability and longe vity of an ICT solution 
and the development goals that it supports. Developers of successful ICT solutions routinely iterate 
product design to incorporate lessons from user experience . Aside from capacity to use the tool, users 
must feel comfortable with t he implementation of the program and the technology in their communities . 
The World Bank -funded WSP ran a proof- of-concept in India to test the potential for using mobile  
technology  to improve rural sanitation monitoring. A local technology firm developed a mobile 
application, Outcome Tracker, to collect data on key outcomes as they relate to behavior change. The 
electronic form  contains standard data collection fields  and requires a photo of the participant,  
ICT FOR CLTS : A LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT –  AUGUST  2018 18 preferably with the toilet, and coordinates for the data collection location to improve data quality and 
accuracy. The lessons learned from this pilot, as published in 2012, discuss the participants’ hesitanc y to 
be photographed ; therefore,  the implementers had to reassure the participants that the info rmation 
would be kept anonymous (Kumar & Singh, 2012) .  
The Innovations at Scale for Community Access and Lasting Effects (inSCALE) project in Mozambique 
was an implementation research project that studied the effects of mHealth  applications on the quality 
of service and care provided by community health workers. inSCALE  evaluated the implementation of a 
technology solution used in support of child care services delivered through a national health system. 
The solut ion provided a n implementation support tool that walks community health workers through 
the patient consultation steps to assess, classify, treat, and refer patients. Another component w as a 
web-based, real -time dashboard that project stakeholders at the p rovincial and district  level use d to 
access and analyze project data (Mendoza et al., 2014) . In 2014 preliminary results of a process 
evaluation determined that a user -centered design approach was critical to the d evelopment of the tool . 
Government of Mozambique Ministry of Health staff and community health workers were involved in  
every step of  the development process  to collect user feedback on the tool and its features  through 
interviews  and observation of commun ity health workers during patient visits (Mendoza  et al., 2014).  By 
involving the users in a participatory design process, developers ensured that the content and delivery of 
the implementation support tool were effective in prov iding community health workers the tools 
required to provide good quality of care.  
 
   
ICT FOR CLTS : A LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT –  AUGUST  2018 19 4.0 CUSTOMIZING AN ICT TOOL FOR CLTS  
This section focuses on considerations for and features of a  possible  customized ICT tool for CLTS , 
noting that the team’s  review of the available  literature revealed very few cases where ICT facilitate s 
CLTS implementation . This section first considers  the potential end  users of a CLTS  ICT tool and their 
incentives for using the tool . A presentation of illustrative functionalities fol lows, including examples 
from current national -scale CLTS programs and from other sectors.  This section conclude s with 
discussion of the specific challenges and questions to consider when customizing  an ICT tool for CLTS.  
4.1 POTENTIAL USERS OF AN ICT TOOL TO SUPPORT CLTS  
As discussed above , ICT tools will be  neither effective nor  sustainable if not designed to fulfill demand 
expressed by end  users, and this is  especially  true for basic public  sector  functions such as monitoring , 
oversight, and regulation . While not explicitly addressed in every interview conducted  with country -
level donors, implementers, and ICT solution providers, the  assessment  team noted that discussions did 
not reliably reveal demand for a customized ICT tool to support CLTS implement ation. 
The definition of a “user” for any ICT application in CLTS will vary with program maturity  and country 
context . Based on parallel desk review of global CLTS p ractice  conducted by the assessment team  
(USAID, 2018) , there are five potential target use r groups for a CLTS ICT tool : 
1. National and sub -national government s 
2. Lead implementing agencies  (typically, but not exclusively,  international NGOs)  
3. Country -level funders of CLTS (e.g., Global Sanitation Fund [GSF] and UNICEF)  
4. Local actors  executing  and mon itoring CLTS programs  
5. Households  
Each group has its own incentives and disincentiv es for supporting , acquiring, and  adopting an ICT 
solution , as outlined in  Table 4 . Though not listed as a target user group  per se,  donors could  take 
interest in and share m any of the incentives and disincentives listed in the table, as they affect the impact 
of each dollar spent and consistency of monitoring and reporting.  
National and sub -national government s, including the ministries responsible for rural sanitation and su b-
national government structures ( e.g., districts, communes,  and counties) , are likely necessary adopters 
for any tool to be sustained at scale. Both the Zambian and Kenyan governments have set indicators 
associated with natio nal plans or commitments towar d achieving CLTS goals , and both have adopted  
ICT-supported national monitoring systems . Government institutions  must have the necessary human 
and financial resources (either directly or through  sustained  donor funding) to deploy, operate, and 
adapt an ICT  solution at scale. These factors , in addition to bureaucratic and political barriers , pose 
challenges to the ability of national and sub -national government institutions  to be responsible for 
ongoing development and maintenance of an ICT tool at the natio nal level.  
Local officials and/ or frontline community leaders who are often responsible for triggering the 
community and reporting outputs are a vital piece of most national CLTS activities. It is difficult to 
characterize the utility of ICT solution s for that user group, as these likely vary  with the local context. 
Some may view a mobile data collection device as a welcome tool for simplifying data collection and 
documentation at all stages of the CLTS process. Others may have less interest in learning new  skills or 
being responsible for entering data on a handheld device. It is critical to establish incentives for frontline 
workers to use a given ICT solution  consistently .

Households or

situation in their community  
• Improving access to information, 
providing motivation for behavior 
change  
• Encouraging community engagement 
and ownership of sustainable progress

disparities and social norms that 
may disproportionately impact 
disadvantaged indiv iduals ( i.e., 
women , children , and the very 
poor)  
• Resistance to bringing advanced 
technology into community  
 
Civic and traditional l eaders in rural communities may be interested to know how the sanitation 
situation in their town compares with neighboring  villages, but  whether  this information is  more 
efficiently shared in regular face -to-face meetings with representatives of higher levels of government 
than shared through a mobile device  remains unclear . Use of limited resources will be a consideration in  
such cases, as t he funding and logistics associated with deployment at scale represents a significant 
hurdle due to the sheer number of actors involved in CLTS at the community level, often reaching into 
the tens of thousands nationally .  
The Zambia case provide s a compelling  argument that community leaders  desire knowledge of the 
sanitation status in their jurisdictions , and that their access to  this information and subsequent 
dissemination  led to greater adoption rates  (Tiwari et al., 2017) . There also is reinforcing  evidence from 
the mHealth  sector that information being fed back to individuals or the community can positive ly 
impact on sustained behavior change  (Lee et al ., 2016) . In a CLTS program , individuals could  sign up to 
receive SMS messages or voi ce recordings for updates on the community’s progress toward ODF  status . 
This type of feedback loop could generate competition at the household level and evoke feelings of  
pride or shame that motivates an individual to become more active in the community. This specific 
application has not yet been tested .  
4.2 ILLUSTRATIVE FUNCTIONALIT IES OF AN ICT TOOL  FOR CLTS  
Table 5 presents  illustrative features and functionalities of a hypothetical technology solution for CLTS 
program monitoring and implementation ; each is discussed further in the sections below . Figure 7 
indicates  where and how ICTs can be integrated into the CLTS process  and how data feedback loops 
can support successful implement ation, monitoring, and analysis . Such a solution could assist 
implement ers and governments to standardize the CLTS implementation process . In addition to  
enhanc ing the ease, utility, and timeliness of data collection , it could  provide simplified online platforms 
for training and ongoing capacity building of field staff. CLTS programs are already leveraging ICTs for 
monitoring programmatic outputs (e.g. , toilets constructed) and outcomes (e.g. , ODF villages certified), 
but so far , the use of ICTs to support implementation, sustained behavior change  and training appears to 
be limited .

4.2.1 Monitoring for Decision -Making – “The Data Problem”   
One of the  foremost challenges facing governments and implementers managing CLTS programs today is 
effective and sustained monitoring of outputs (i.e., absence of open defecation or presence of toilets). A  
2012 review of CLTS grey literature identified “ a widespread  need for standardized monitoring 
mechanisms, rigorously evaluating CLTS projects, and appropriately using data that is already being 
collected  … the need to generate value for collecting monitoring data and using it to improve CLTS 
outcomes  …” (Venkataramanan, 2012) . A more recent systematic review of both academic and grey 
literature by the same team found that “the theme of improving monitoring and evaluation of programs  
was mentioned in 48 percent  of the literature” surveyed  (Venkataramanan et al., 2018) . On one hand, 
there is a paucity of high-quality data. A 2013 UNICEF report focusing on CLTS implementation in East 
Asia and the Pacific region states that “CLTS monitoring remains a significant weakness, at both national 
and project levels  … few countries have mechanisms that require routine reporting or analysis of 
monitoring data, thu s there is little demand for the data ” (UNICEF, 2015) . UNICEF updated the report 
in 2015 and reported comparable results . On the o ther hand, those monitoring data regularly collected 
by CLTS implementers are often  not used effectively for decision -making and learning. A recent  CLTS 
desk review (USAID, 2018) conclude d, “CLTS has a data problem” that exists at every stage along the 
CLTS data flow, as depicted in Figure 7. UNICE F, SNV , and others report experiences applying ICT  
tools to CLTS monitoring (and  more broadly as part of the CLTS approach), but careful  documentation 
is lacking. Often, reporting and analysis of monitoring data is completed by implementing NGOs, who 
then share results—either as static documents or live dashboards —with relevant host -country 
governments and, in some cases, the public. This review uncovered few examples of feedback loops 
used for adaptive management or the reinforcement of behavior change, rather than simply for 
reporting.

CLTS
 
Examples of National -Level CLTS Monitoring Systems . Three examples of national -level 
monitoring systems from Indonesia, K enya, and Zambia are discussed below .  
With support from the World Bank, the Indonesian government has put in place t he Sanitasi Total 
Berbasis Masyarakat  (Community -Based Total Sanitation, or STBM ) Program  that includes a national -level 
monitoring system (Robiarto  et al., 2014) . A public -facing  database is avail able online5 that lays out  
baseline measur ements and progress toward  high level sanitation outcomes , i.e., number of people using 
improved, unimpr oved, and shared facilities.  
With support from UNICEF,  the Kenyan Ministry of Health rolled out a national CLTS monitoring 
system in December 2016.6 The National ODF Kenya 2020 Campaign Framework, or Road Map, 
describes a devolved government structure relying on 47 county governments with decentralized  units 
at the sub -county, ward , and village levels (Changu & Kwangu, 2016) . In a webinar hos ted by CLTS 
Knowledge Hub, Shiva Singh of UNICEF explained the CLTS monitoring system and associated 
processes.  During the triggering stage, village -level information is collected on paper -based forms and 
then entered into the electronic system. In additio n to sending electronic notifications to those at higher 
levels of government responsible for verifying and certifying any subsequent ODF claims, hard copies  are 
processed at each stage to confirm authenticity. Initially , a microplan for data management was 
developed and data were compiled in Microsoft E xcel sheets for two years even before the online 
system was functional , at which point the existing data was uploaded . A public -facing online dashboard 
presents data visualizations of coverage, success, and certification rates (indicators for triggering, self -
declaration, and independent verification, respectively) disaggregated by county, sub -county, and ward 
and lists the implementing partners operating in each county. These data are updated  on an ongoing

ICT FOR CLTS : A LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT –  AUGUST  2018 24 basis, allowing  for adaptive management as progress and performance gaps  are highlighted that help 
identify  capacity building needs  at specific points in the institutional arrangement  (S. Singh, 2017) .  
As discussed elsewhere in this report, t he MLGH in Zambia, with financial support from the UK 
Department for International Development ( DFID ) through UNICEF, has established a national database 
of sanitation coverage after  nearly  a decade of sustained investment in CLTS programs. T he DHIS2 
M2W reporting platform that Akros piloted is now used  across the country,  paired with airtime 
reimbursements to community volunteers to incentivize regular reporting . The use of a single ICT tool 
at a national scale employs the same data standards  and architecture, resulting in data that is up -to-date 
and usable for national - and district -level decision -making.  
Examples of Sanitation Program Monitoring Using ICTs . SNV’s  DFID- funded Sustainable 
Sanitation & Hygiene for All (SSH4A) Results Program provides an illuminative  example of a project 
monitoring system that integrates  results across  national borders . Associated a ctivities center on  four 
pillars  that transcend  conventional,  CLTS -only programs: sanitation demand creation, supply chain 
strengthe ning, hygiene behavior change, and  WASH governance. SNV is implementing the SSH4A 
approach in eight  countries ,7 and employs  Akvo F low to administer annual project -specific survey s while 
tailoring the monitoring protocols for each country program around nat ional platforms. In Uganda for 
example, SNV uses the Kenga  application to track SSH4A results across 15 districts . (Kenga was 
designed by a local developer  and is based on ODK , an open- source suite of tools developed and 
maintained by University of Washington's  Department of Computer Science and Engineering .) The 
Uganda Ministry of Health’s s tandard household survey form was  customized and digitized to collect key 
data relevant to sanitation and hygiene, such as presence of a handwashing facility. SNV used the Kenga 
database to produce summary reports, which are submitted to district -level authorities, who then send 
teams to verify the outcomes . Both the ICT tool and its associated  broader data management system  
evolved , including responsibility for data collection shifting from the implementing partner to the county 
health assistant. I teration of the process yielded the important finding that it was best to first build 
leadership capacity through creation of san itation committees, supported with monthly trainings and 
interactive updates , before  attempting to trigger the community  (L. Nabasirye, personal communication, 
April 18, 2017) .  
The CHOBA program implemented by EMW in Vietnam and Cambodia  also utilizes ICT  for program 
monitoring and verification . CHOBA activities include sanitation financing, hygiene education, marketing, 
and results -based financial transfers and rewards target ed at the poorest 40  percent  of the rural 
population to accelerate their climb up  the sanitation ladder. Though not a CLTS program  per se , 
CHOBA  does deploy CLTS -like elements, such as the mobilization of communities and the triggering of 
disgust to bring about behavior change. Because output -based aid ( OBA) program s requir e verificati on 
of outputs for the reimbursement of costs, EMW required a robust data management system for  
tracking outputs such as latrine purchases and associated hygienic behaviors . It also was  strong ly 
incentivized  by the OBA  to analyze the data an d apply learning  to refine the CHOBA implementation  
approach  for optimal performance  (since the implementer’s remuneration  was conditioned on service 
delivery) . As the program went to scale, eventually reaching over a  million households in Vietnam, EMW 
recognized the need  to shift to digital data collection and management  to support the verification 
process. EMW initially commissioned a third party to develop a custom ized digital system  from scratch  
to exactly mirror EMW’s existing paper -based system , but the demands of ma naging and de -bugging the 
system exceed ed organi zational capacity. EMW later engaged  Akvo to assess , streamlin e, and support  
the CHOBA  verification process via an off- the-shelf application  (Akvo Flow ) that required minimal  
debugging . 
                                                           
7 Ethiopia, Ghana, K enya, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Nepal ( previously also South Sudan).   
ICT FOR CLTS : A LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT –  AUGUST  2018 25 The cases of CHOBA and  SS4HA demonstrate lessons for scaling ICTs for CLTS. SNV leveraged two 
existing ICT solutions (Akvo Flow  and ODK) and adapted them to fit the needs of SS4HA across several 
countries , through iterative implementation . To scale up CHOBA activities while str eamlining its 
processes , EMW engaged  Akvo for both its ICT solution and consulting services  (SAAS) . Both cases 
demonstrate several best practices in line with the Principle s for Digital Development  (i.e., understand 
the existing ecosystem ; design for scale ; be data driven ; use open standards, open data, open source, and 
open innovation; reuse and improve ; and be collaborative ). 
4.2.2 ICT for Community Engagement  
The use of ICTs to collect data for NGO or government use rarely taps into  the community 
engagem ent aspect of CLTS (Pasteur, 2017a) , and t here may be  unexplored opportunities  for 
implementers to engage communities better through data and information  sharing with I CTs (e.g., by 
including push data functionality and social media ). However,  any such community engagement should be 
designed with consideration for local gender, age, and equity gaps in access to mobile technology and 
digital literacy. The influence of pus h messaging on accountability and behavior change for CLTS is worth 
investigation, particularly pushing out information  to CLTS stakeholders on CLTS- related activities  such 
as enhancing facilitation of the triggering event, promoting sustained behavior change, and sharing ODF 
status.  
One new potential application of ICT tools to sanitation product and service provision is the ability to 
show potential customers a suite of product options, or to automate possible customization of toilet 
designs based on a se t of physical, economic, and cultural criteria set by the user. WaterAid recently 
began exploring such opportunities  (Andres Hueso, personal communication , July 26, 2017) , though in 
effect these are “sup ply side” support interventions  (as compared to CLTS,  which  is explicitly behavior -
focused and intended to be product neutral ). 
Enhancing  Facilitation  of the Triggering Event . Often , the community triggering stage of CLTS is 
led by  teams of two or three individuals comprised of a mix of community health volu nteers , NGO 
extension agents and government officials . Quality of facilitation during a triggering event  often  is cited 
as a determinant of success  (Venkataramanan et al ., 2018) . However , maintaining a consistently high 
standard of facilitation  fidelity  in national CLTS efforts is challenging , due to its reliance on facilitator 
personality and variability of the community characteristics . An ICT tool could potentially help improve 
the quality of CLTS triggering by supporting facilitators to conduct  standard  activities including: social 
mapping, transect walk, shit calculations, F -diagram, estimations for m edical expenses and loss of 
time/unproductivity, community action plan towards ODF, and community monitoring  (Kenya Minist ry 
of Health, 2013) . A 2009 review of CLTS implementation in six countries highlights innovation and ways 
in which implementers have employed creative methods for supporting triggering. In Ghana, a local 
NGO experienced an ineffective triggering event due to the lack of community participation in the 
process. However, the NGO had taken a video of the triggering event and played it back to the 
community at a subsequent meeting which sparked renewed commitment and action by the community 
members (Chambers, 2009) . Recordings of natural leader testimonials after triggering events or personal 
commitment photos can be used in several ways : to refresh the community’s original commitment  (Box 
9), to share the commitment of a community with other stakeholders , and to remind the community of 
the nature of the triggering event.   
ICT FOR CLTS : A LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT –  AUGUST  2018 26  
Promoting Sustained Behavior Change . Recidivism , or “slippage ,” to open defecation beh aviors 
after ODF declaration  is a widely  recognized  challenge . Providing access for  CLTS implementers to 
training materials and online video content  through mobile solutions appears to be an underexploited 
use of mobile technology, which could support sust ained behavior change.  Taking an example from the 
mHealth  realm, ORB is a free online library of resource s8 for use by frontline health workers, created 
by mPowering with the support of USAID, includ ing a dedicated WASH hub with online training 
programs and educational videos for community health workers to share with community members . 
One such video produced by Digital Green for use in India offers instruct ions on handwashing and toilet 
maintenance  in a local dialect  to increase hand hygiene and reduce op en defecation . Such a tool could be 
made accessible to  and relevant for  local facilitators of CLTS programs  to deliver fresh messaging and 
reinforce behaviors to maintain ODF status .  
As mentioned  earlier , icddr,b with John Hopkins is currently testing the  efficacy of phone -based 
reminders to improv e practices around handwashing with soap and safe water storage among 
households. Similar experiments using SMS messages could be  adapted to target  households (or even 
entire communities) participating in  CLTS to  understand the effects of these messages on recidivism.  
Sharing ODF Status and Feedback Loops . A 2017 CLTS Knowledge Hub Learning Paper  (Pasteur, 
2017b)  highlights the need for local ownership of CLTS  monitoring processes and outcomes,  including 
the integration of monitoring activities into the roles of community leadership and local professional s. In 
practice , this means  that ICT solutions should be designed to engage the local stakeholders and ensure  
that information is returned to th ose stakeholders .  
As described in Box 5 , the Zambian MLGH, with the support of UNICEF Zambia, is leveraging DHIS2  to 
enable the submittal of periodic reports on latrine coverage by local volunteers . Community champions 
in the villages use  the system to collect data on toilet coverage and use , which is  transmitted wirelessly 
to an online M2W  platform which visualizes the data in a real -time dashboard to create reports for 
chiefs, the district WASH committees, and beneficia ries (Markle et al., 2017) . The purpose of the 
dashboard is to increase transparency,  stimulate behavior change  among the chiefs,  and advance the 
villages’ progress towards ODF status. Chiefs use tablets (provided by the program) enabled with a 
custom application to access  reports relevant to their j urisdiction , allowing them to follow up with 
individuals, households, or communities that are falling behind on goals or targets . One report suggests 
that “this act of taking previously private activities ( i.e., open defecation) and making them publicly 
known further motivates behavior change” and that the system “propels rapid reporting throughout 
administrative hierarchies among stakeholder ministries” (Markle et al., 2017) . The compl ementary use 
of the DHIS2 data collection system and the bespoke M2W pla tform for monitoring and reporting 
represents a locally appropriate and effective ICT solution .  
  
                                                           
8 http://health -orb.org/  Box 9: Recording testimonials . The USAID -funded WASHPlus  Project’s approach to CLTS  in Mal i included 
equipping  facilitation teams with dictaphones and digital cameras to capture testimonials and images of natural 
leaders who emerged  from triggering events and subsequent monitoring visits. The images and voiceovers are 
made into short 3 -4-minute  films and shown to community groups and local leaders (e.g. traditional authorities, 
women and women's groups, etc.) to help maintain their commitment to achieving ODF in communities 
experiencing delays  implementing their action plans.  
  
ICT FOR CLTS : A LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT –  AUGUST  2018 27 4.3 CHALLENGES OF CUSTOMIZING AN ICT TOOL FOR CLTS  
IMPLEMENTATION  
In addition to overarching challenges  in designing and introducing sustainable ICT solutio ns in the 
development contex t discussed in Section 2.2, CLTS poses  some challenges  to customizing a n ICT 
solution, including:  
CLTS has been , until recently , targeted at rural areas . ICT usage in rural areas is constrained by 
connectivity, electricity, and mobile penetration as well as by such socio economic and cultural 
considerations as  affordability,  literacy, slow technology  adoption , and concerns about privacy. In some 
CLTS contexts, transmitting information on  mobile devices simply will not  be useful , or possible .  
An appropriate institutional home . Typical ly, the institutional home for a  globally facing ICT 
solution would be an organization  that receives consistent funding for maintaining the tool , regularly 
pushing out updates and supporting documentat ion, and responding to technical issues as they arise. 
However, due to the diversity of CLTS implementation  across the globe , and recognizing that an  
effective  ICT tool would be customized for nationally specific CLTS  approaches , considerations for an 
institutional home  either at the global or national level  include:  
• Who will maintain the technology (updating code, responding to bugs, continuously upgrading 
features based on user feedback, etc. ); 
• Who will advise on how the tool is applied in a country conte xt (the technical advisory support for 
the features that help facilitate the CLTS approach); and  
• Who will provide continued funding for  the tool .  
Heterogeneous  approaches to CLTS.  ICT features and reporting standards that align with one 
countr y’s approach  to CLTS may be incongruent  with another. The variation of CLTS protocols and 
monitoring mechanisms make it difficult to customize a single tool to support CLTS implementa tion and 
monitoring across use cases.   
4.4 GUIDING QUESTIONS FO R CUSTOMIZING AN ICT  TOOL SPECIFIC TO CLTS  
The following are three sets of questions to guide organizations considering development or 
customization of an ICT tool to support  CLTS  implementation , drawing on a user centered design 
approach and applying the Principles for Digital  Development. Ultimately, programs should have the 
human, material, and financial capacities to support the management of an ICT solution. The following 
guide takes into consideration many of these capacities .  
Local CLTS Programming Context:  
• Is there a na tional CLTS policy , or is CLTS an element of national rural sanitation policy ? Is there a 
national CLTS monitoring, certification, verification protocol?  Are the existing policies gender 
sensitive?  
• What is the local landscape of CLTS implementers and to wh at extent are they utilizing ICT s in 
either rural sanitation or other WASH applications ? 
• Are there existing information management system s into which the tool can be integrated ?  
• Is there an active culture of monitoring outcomes, learning from results, and  adapting programs?  
• On what level/scale are there perceived need s and expressed demand  by stakeholders?    
ICT FOR CLTS : A LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT –  AUGUST  2018 28 - Who (women, men, boys and/or girls) benefit from integrating ICT in the program?   
- Do women and girls want and need different content than men and boys?  If so, how do you 
make it accessible?  
• What is the data management plan ? What type of data are  needed? How will data be used?  How will 
they be collected , by whom , at what level , and how often?  
• What feedback loops are needed? What data need to be shared, at  what level , and how often?  
Local ICT Context:  
• What is the state of the enabling infrastructure and access  to devices and connectivity , nationally 
and regionally, taking full account of drivers of inequality such as rural/urban divide, gender, 
economic di sadvantage?  
- Prevalence and cost of mobile phones and other computing hardware and software  
- Phone service coverage and internet connectivity  
- Access to electricity  
- Which are the gender differences in how, where, when and why men and women use ICT 
relevant to  the program?  
- What are the connections between online and offline power structures and inequalities?  
• Is there a national ICT policy?  Are there sector -specific ICT polic ies (e-Health, e-WASH, etc .)? Are 
the existing laws and policies gender  sensitive?  
• What  is the local landscape of existing ICT tools, developers, and partners?  
• What is the level of IT capacity to manage and maintain the system, among local CLTS stakeholders 
and IT sector?  
• What is the local capacity of users to interface with the system (comp uter literacy)?  
Implications for the ideal ICT, based on answers to the above:  
• What are the hardware and software requirements to run an ICT solution?  
• What documentation is needed to deploy an ICT solution?  
• What resources ( e.g., funding, training, documen tation,  and staff) are needed to make it sustainable?  
• What are the budget and cost implications (short term and long term)?  
• Which institution will manage the ICT solution in the long term?   
- Who will maintain the technology ? 
- Who will advise on how the tool is applied in a country context ? 
- Who will provide continued funding for the tool ? 
- What is the hand -over plan, if not the same organization as the manager of the solution’s 
development? 
ICT FOR CLTS : A LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT –  AUGUST  2018  29 5.0 CONCLUSIONS  
This review explore s opportunities  for and limitations to  expanding the use of ICT tools  to support 
CLTS implementation. Evidence from other development sectors suggests that there are  untapped 
opportunities for ICT  solution s to support CLTS progr am implementation and monitorin g; however, 
there are challenges to doing so .  
5.1 OPPORTUNITIES FOR IC T IN CLTS  
Go beyond monitoring : Integrate information sharing and feedback loops . Experience  from 
the health sector suggest that feedback loops to community -level users can  improve the delivery of 
public health service s. Push messaging is infrequently used in WASH ICT solutions, but it may well offer 
opportunities for sharing information with community members. Training videos for CLTS implementers 
could be integrated into a mobile CLTS app or loaded directly onto mobile devices. Videos , photos,  and 
tutorials  also could be used to support behavior change and reduce slippage if used by community health 
workers or natural leaders during follow -up household visits.  Except for  push messaging to traditional 
leaders, we are unaware of other  examples of ICT support of implementation as described here; some 
piloting and beta testing of a tool will certainly be required not only to verify functionality but also to 
determine its perceived value to a variety of implementing organizations (who ultimately must be 
thought of as the “customers” of any such innovative CLTS ICT product) . 
Create standards for data and the appropriate features to facilitate the CLTS process . 
Given the inconsistency of CLTS methodologies and the need for loca l customization when using ICTs 
in the development context, it is difficult to design a single  ICT tool to assist with CLTS worldwide. 
However, the suite of available  ICT features  is suited to support specific functions of the CLTS process 
in implementatio n, monitoring, and reporting . Standards can be created to establish best practice for 
each case and should be promoted throughout the CLTS community of practice . The Principle of Digital 
Development provide the foundation for specific recommendations on be st practice for ICTs in CLTS, 
as outlined below.  
5.2 BEST PRACTICES FOR C USTOMIZING AN ICT TO OL FOR CLTS  
Design with the user  (Principle for Digital Development 1) . The customization of an ICT tool 
for CLTS must be carried out in close collaboration with users and stakeholders at every level for it to 
be useful and effective . Focus user -centered design on relevant stakeholder groups including front -line 
CLTS workers, NGOs and local authorities at the national and sub -national levels. Allow time for  field 
testing with multiple groups of end users , specifically seeking the input  of women and other 
disadvantaged groups , trial-and-error, and iterative development. Work closely with relevant 
stakeholders to define features and processes to ensure maximum usage a nd efficacy.  
Integrate into public -sector information management systems.  Most countries have existing 
monitoring frameworks for data collection and management, often through the Ministry of Health.  
Leverage existing systems and tools to streamline progra mmatic processes and add value to data 
collected. Understand strengths and weaknesses of national sanitation monitoring systems that the ICT 
solution will support. Be realistic about existing bottlenecks and the potential effectiveness of an ICT 
solution t o overcome them —there are many reasons why ICT solutions may not be useful in a given 
context (or that the maturity of existing information management systems may not lend itself to an ICT 
tool). Note and maintain consistency with  relevant  ICT policies, es pecially on issues of cybersecurity, 
ethics, and integration into national development plans.  This practice follows Principle of Digital  
ICT FOR CLTS : A LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT –  AUGUST  2018  30 Development 2, Understand the Ecosystem , which specifically calls out the importance of aligning to 
existing technologi cal, legal, and regulatory policies . 
Engage with national govern ment s. Government engagement  is a key to broad uptake of any ICT 
solution, especially if a monitoring frameworks or information management system already exists. CLTS 
is incorporated into nati onal policy for rural sanitation in some  30 countries. A national government 
with a strong commitment to CLTS and a track record of CLTS prgramming may be as appropriate an 
institutional home as a multilateral institution such as UNICEF or the Water Supply  and Sanitation 
Collaborative Council . This practice follows Principle of Digital Development 4 , Build for Sustainability , 
which specifically calls out the importance of engaging with local governments to ensure integration into 
national strategy and ident ify high -level government advocates . 
Build for sustainability (Principle for Digital Development 4) . Model costs accurately and 
update assumptions regularly. Consider factors that contribute to the selection of an appropriate 
financial model, such as fundi ng, capacity, and scale. After further deep -dive assessments, create an 
investment plan for implementing an ICT solution at scale, including near - and far -term drivers of costs 
as well as sources of funding to cover the expenses beyond initial funding peri ods.  
Be data driven and be collaborative (Principles for Digital Development 5 and 9) . Seek to 
build in feedback loops to share information for reporting and learning with stakeholders at all levels  and 
actively engage in adaptive management . Implementers  can leverage a web -based portal as a main 
channel for sharing knowledge, reports, and resources to increas e their reach by using SMS, voice 
recordings, public information kiosks, radio , either with stakeholders at the community level or across 
the global community of practice.   
Reuse and improve (Principle for Digital Development 7).  Leverage an existing platform  that has 
already been proven in that country co ntext . Focus on  how features are likely to complement or 
support the locally adapted  CLTS approach . Our review identified some promising  ICT tools, including 
mWater, Akvo and DHIS2, but there are other, more generic solutions that can  be customized, 
integrated, or adapted to create a modular CLTS tool, such as Kobo or ODK .
