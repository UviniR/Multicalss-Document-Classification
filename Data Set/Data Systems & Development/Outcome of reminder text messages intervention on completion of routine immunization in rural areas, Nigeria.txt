Summary
Completion of routine immunization for infants has been a challenge in Nigeria, and existing strate-
gies implemented to promote immunization coverage yielded limited success. The use of reminder
short services message (SMS) in mobilizing mothers of infants, especially in rural areas with lower
immunization coverage has been suggested. This study investigated the effect of reminder SMS sentto mothers in rural communities on full and timely completion of routine childhood immunization. A
quasi-experimental design was adopted, 3500 mothers of infants were categorized into the
Intervention and Control groups recruited at various Primary Healthcare Centres in 6 states and theFCT, Nigeria. Reminder SMS were sent to mothers in the intervention group for 10 months. We
adopted mixed methods of data collection, signiﬁcance level set at p¼0.05. Majority of respondents
were married (Control 94.3%; Intervention 95.5%), have experienced multiple births (Control 79.0%;Intervention 74.9%). Adherence to routine immunization appointment dates and completion of all
immunizations was higher in the Intervention group (76.0%) compared with the Control (73.3%). A sig-
niﬁcant association between adherence to appointment dates and completeness of routine immuniza-tion vaccine was found. The Intervention group had a signiﬁcantly higher completion rate for measles
and yellow fever vaccines (55.3%; 75.9%) compared with the Control group (26.8%; 23.9%).
Qualitative ﬁndings revealed positive comments from mothers in the intervention group that the mes-sages increase awareness of immunization dates, assisted in readjusting their time which inﬂuenced
timely completion. Interventions using reminder SMS enhanced infant immunization delivery; we rec-
ommend scale-up and integration into the health system to increase national immunization coverage.

BACKGROUND
The Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), in-
troduced in 1978 to provide routine immunization tochildren less than the age of 2 years, recorded initial butintermittent successes. The optimum level recorded in
the early 1990s was 81.5%, but since the period of suc-cess, Nigeria has witnessed a consistent reduction in im-
munization coverage. By 1996, the national data

showed <30% coverage for all antigens, and this de-
creased to 12.9% in 2003 ( Babalola and Olabisi, 2004 ;
Ophori et al. , 2014 ) which was among the lowest in the
world and the worst in the West African sub-region.
Two National Demographic Health Surveys conductedlater showed a marginal increase in national childhood
immunization in 2008 (22.7%) and 2013 (25. 4%). Of
special concern is the state of measles vaccine coverage
which has remained low ( National Population
Commission [Nigeria] and ICF International, 2014 ).
Thus, national vaccination coverage has not exceeded
30% in the last three decades ( Table 1 ). The NDHS
2013 report on the immunization coverage status in thesix geo-political zones and the Federal Capital Territory
(FCT) shows lower vaccination coverage in the northern
zones (North West, 9.6%; North East, 14.2%; NorthCentral, 26.9%) compared with the south (South West,
40.9%; South East, 51.7%; South South, 52.0%). The
FCT recorded the highest coverage of 60.9%. The im-
munization coverage in urban and rural areas in the
country was 42.5% and 15.8%, respectively.
Past efforts made by the Nigerian government to ad-
dress the low childhood routine immunization coverage[adaption of WHO/Reaching Every District (RED)] ap-
proach in response to the decline or stagnation in rou-
tine immunization coverage ( Vandelaer et al. , 2008 ;
IMMUNIZATIONbasics [USAID], 2009 ) have yielded
limited success ( Abdulraheem et al. , 2011 ;Jegede and
Owumi, 2013 ;Ataguba et al. , 2016 ). Other efforts in-
clude the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI)
(Adedokun et al. , 2017 ), National Immunisation Days
fNIDS g, Immunisation Plus Days fIPDsg—days set
aside to strengthen the fight against polio in Nigeria
(IMMUNIZATIONbasics [USAID], 2009 ) and public
enlightenment; these have also yielded limited success
(Abdulraheem et al. , 2011 ;Jegede and Owumi, 2013 ).
In the light of this, there is an urgent need to test innova-
tive approaches such as the use of reminder mobilephone text messages or Short Services Messages (SMS)
in mobilizing mothers of infants especially in the ruralareas with lower immunization coverage. Studies con-
ducted in Pakistan, Guatemala and Zimbabwe con-
cluded that SMS intervention improved routinevaccination coverage ( Kazi et al. , 2018 ), evidence from
the application of SMS technology in other countries
show that it is feasible to implement in low- and middle-
income countries ( Domek et al. , 2016 ) and increase in
immunization coverage was attributed to the use of SMS
(Bangure et al. , 2015 ). Thus, such mHealth applications
are useful because they capitalize on existing mobile
phone infrastructure and an audience already familiar
with the technology in addition to ease of use ( Cole-
Lewis and Kershaw, 2010 ;Marshall et al. , 2013 ), low
cost and public interests ( Terry, 2008 ).
However, evidence demonstrating the impact of re-
minder SMS as a tool for enhancing the uptake and
timely completion of routine immunization in Nigeria
remains scarce despite the evidence of mobile phoneownership in Nigeria (urban 88.6%; rural 64.8%)
(National Population Commission [Nigeria] and ICF
International, 2014 ). Thus, the goal of this study was to
investigate the effect of reminder text messages sent tomothers of infants on full and timely completion of rou-
tine childhood immunization. Findings from this study
would contribute to the body of literature, which is cur-rently scarce and could be used to influence m-Health
policy dialogue in Nigeria.
METHODS
Study setting
This study was quasi-experimental in design; two groups
(Intervention and Control) were assessed at Baseline andEndline.
The study was conducted in Nigeria between
November 2017 and May 2019. Six states (each state

representing a geo-political zone in Nigeria) were se-
lected through simple random sampling in addition to
the FCT that was purposively selected. Two rural LocalGovernment Areas (LGAs) from each state, includingtwo area councils from the FCT, were randomly selectedand assigned to the Intervention and Control groups.
Mothers of infants aged 0 /C02 months attending im-
munization clinics in the Primary Healthcare Centres(PHCs) in the 14 LGAs across the 6 states and the FCTand who owned at least 1 mobile phone during the pe-
riod (study population) were randomly enrolled in the
study. Specifically, mothers with infants between the ageof 0 and 2 months were recruited because infants withinthis age range can still access immunization services tillthe 14th week of birth. After the 14th week, the nextvisit for routine immunization for such an infant is atthe 9th month when the child is due for measles and yel-low fever vaccination. Therefore, the period between the14th week and 9th month (8 /C010 months, depending on
the age of the infant when the mother was recruited)
was used for the intervention. The sample size was cal-culated using the formulas adapted from Kirkwood and
Sterne (2010) andLwanga et al. (1991) . A sample size
of 166 eligible mothers of infants for each LGA wasobtained but increased to 250 to adjust for attrition.This resulted in a minimum of a total sample size of3500 mothers of infants for all 14 LGAs in all the 6 geo-political zones and the FCT.
Intervention
The reminder text messages were based on focus groupdiscussions (FGDs) with mothers at PHCs and supple-mented with suggestions from questionnaires. The out-put from the data collection methods was used to designthe content, language and time of delivery. The messages
were first developed in English language and translated
to Yoruba, Ijaw, Hausa and Igbo languages and fo-cussed on the following: need to keep the next routineimmunization appointments, benefits of keeping routineimmunization appointments, benefits of timely and fullcompletion of all basic routine immunizations, the con-sequences of refusal/non-completion of all basic routineimmunizations on children’s health and locations ofhealthcare facilities with routine immunization services.The messages were customized and coded as Riga kafi
for the Hausas, Ogwu mgbochi for the Ibos and Abiye
lomo for the Yorubas.
These messages were sent to mobile phones of moth-
ers of infants in the intervention group and their signifi-cant others (relatives named by mothers) for 10 monthsusing a bulk SMS account created on a platform of oneof bulk SMS service providers inclusive of the mothers’
phone numbers in the contact list. The messages weresent at scheduled intervals (three times a week between7.00 and 7.15 am). At the end of the 5th month,
Research Assistants visited the mothers’ residence to ver-
ify that their house addresses and telephone numberswere correct, in case either of the two had changed.
Control group
Mothers of infants in the Control group received no rou-tine immunization-related message. However, they weregiven flyers on the importance of adequate child nutri-tion and growth monitoring.
Data collection
Routine immunization clinics or services are not avail-able in all the Primary Health Care (PHC) centres in therural LGAs. For this study, four PHCs where routine im-
munization clinics/services are rendered in an LGA were
selected. A mixed-method of data collection was used.FGD sessions were conducted among consenting moth-
ers of infants, and participants were selected from the
list of mothers of infants who came to the clinic and reg-istered their infants for immunization on the day of visitto the centres. A validated FGD guide was used to facili-
tate the discussion and collect data of infant mothers’
perceptions on immunization and use of reminder mes-sages among mothers. Each FGD session consisted ofeight consenting participants who indicated an interest
in the discussion. In all, a total of 42 FGDs were con-
ducted (3 FGD sessions per LGA). A Key InformantInterview (KII) guide was used to obtain information onopinions about the project from the health workers in
the PHC facilities where the study was conducted.
Overall, a total of 28 KIIs were conducted amonghealthcare workers who are involved in the immuniza-tion programme (2 healthcare workers per LGA). A vali-
dated semi-structured questionnaire was used to
measure immunization knowledge, attitude, reportedand actual vaccines received by infants from mothers.
Also, an observational checklist was used to document
all childhood routine immunizations from the indexchild immunization card including the date a child isexpected to be immunized, the actual date such a child is
vaccinated and the next routine immunization appoint-
ment for the child. Survey respondents were consentingmothers of infants selected from the list of those whoregistered their infants for immunization on the day of
visit to the PHCs. Mothers of infants recruited for the
survey did not participate in the FGD sessions.Reminder text messages intervention on routine immunization completion 767Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/heapro/article/36/3/765/5923781 by guest on 16 December 2022
Ethical considerations
The study was approved by the University of Ibadan/
University College Hospital Ethics Committee (UI/EC/
17/0561). Written informed consent was obtained from
respondents after explaining the objectives of the study,assurance of their privacy and confidentiality of infor-
mation provided, and that participation is voluntary.
During the intervention phase, mothers of infants in theIntervention group received immunization-related re-
minder text messages for about 10 months. Mothers of
infants in the Control group did not receive any re-minder text messages; however, they were provided
with health information flyers on the importance of ob-
serving adequate child nutrition and growth monitoring.
No information on the benefits and importance of
completing all routine immunization antigens for their
children are withheld from any groups of mothers by
this study. Healthcare workers involved in routine im-munization services usually give health talks on the ben-
efits and importance of completion of all vaccine
antigens for their children, and the danger of defaultingand incomplete vaccination. So, all mothers of infants
who come to the clinic receive these health talks regu-
larly before their infants are vaccinated. This is doneroutinely across all states in Nigeria on routine immuni-
zation clinic days. Also, most mothers of infants are ex-
posed to other routine immunization-related messagesreceived on media, either radio or television. The re-
minder SMS among the Intervention group comple-
mented the usual clinic health talks and informationgiven to every mother who attends immunization clinics
irrespective of their states or locations.
Analysis
Qualitative information was transcribed from voicerecorders and handwritten notes, word-processed and
edited, entered into the computer and subjected to con-tent analysis using the NVivo software. Quantitative
data were entered into a computer using IBM/SPSS (ver-
sion 21.0) and analysis presented in descriptive and in-ferential statistics using t-Test, Chi-square and Fisher’s
exact tests with statistical significance set at p¼0.05.
The hypotheses tested in the study were: there is no
significant association between the experimental and
control groups in respect to (i) adherence with appoint-
ment dates and completion rate of immunization forchildren aged 0 /C011 months and (ii) status and comple-
tion rate of immunization for children aged
0/C011 months.RESULTS
Demographics
Majority of the mothers in the Control—94.3%;
Intervention—95.5% groups were married, and most
were Christians (Control—59.0%; Intervention—
60.7%). About half of the respondents (Control—
45.8%; Intervention—53.2%) had a secondary school
education, and above, and trading was the most promi-
nent occupation (40.1% and 34.2% in Control and
Intervention groups, respectively). The mean age ofrespondents was 27.98 65.2 and 27.52 65.3 in Control
and Intervention groups, and the majority had multiple
births (Control—79%; Intervention—74.9%). Health
workers were the primary source of information
(Control—55.4%; Intervention—67.5%). The respond-
ent’s average monthly income was 9372.07 for the con-
trol group and 12 048.19 for the intervention group
(Table 2 ).
Mothers’ overall compliance with routine
immunization appointment dates and
completion of all immunization
The overall level of adherence to routine immunization
appointment date and completion of all immunization
was significantly greater in the intervention group com-
pared with the Control (76.0 versus 73.3%, p¼0.00)
(Table 3 ). Exploration of the outcome of the interven-
tion showed a significant difference between the two
groups in the completion of each vaccine at different lev-
els. For BCG, the completion rate was 41.1% in the
Control group while in the Intervention group, the com-
pletion rate was 77.7%. More importantly, respondents
in the Intervention group had a significantly high com-
pletion rate in measles (55.3%) and yellow fever
(75.9%) vaccines that are obtained at the 9th monthwhen compared with the Control group ( Figure 1 ).
Further breakdown by states ( Table 4 ) indicates dif-
ferences in the overall completion rate exist acrossIntervention and Control LGAs in the selected states.
Intervention groups in Abia, Benue, Katsina and Ondo
states had significantly higher vaccination completion
rates compared with the control group. Still, a reversal
was noted in two states (Bauchi and Bayelsa states)
where the Control significantly performed better. The
FCT showed no significant difference in immunization
completion rates.
The qualitative data on completion/timely appoint-
ment support the quantitative results with positive com-
ments of mothers in the intervention group about the
reminder messages increasing their full and timely768 O. Oladimeji et al.Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/heapro/article/36/3/765/5923781 by guest on 16 December 2022
completion of routine immunization of their children.
One mother said,
I receive text messages on my phone every week at least
twice. I like the messages; it has really helped me to com-
plete my immunisation schedule.
(Mother A, from one of the South East LGAs)
Another mother noted:
I was very impressed because it prepares me against
(next) immunisation and also made me to know, to get
awareness that this immunisation is tomorrow for me to
adjust my time if I should have any other thing to do, doit on time. (Mother B, from one of the FCT AreaCouncils)
Another mother stated:
Immediately after the message, I crosscheck my child’s
immunisation card to be sure of the date.
(Mother C, from one of the North Central LGAs)
Furthermore, the expressed satisfaction by the front-
line health workers in PHCs in the intervention LGAS
lend credence to the quantitative data. One of them
remarked,
Ah ah, yes I have so many expectations from the pro-
gramme, I have so many even with that SMS it has in-creased the number of mothers coming for immunisa-tion and completion. It’s really a good programme we
have been yearning for it and still yearning for the conti-
nuity of the programme. Our people really appreciate it.One of my expectations also is that people should comeout for the immunisation programme, they really came
out. They are even happy; they showed us the text
messages.

Overall, the timely completion of routine immunization
by Intervention group is significantly higher than theControl group, which can be attributable to the re-minder messages intervention. Similar results have beenreported in Pakistan in which 76% versus 71.3% ofTable 3: Overall mothers’ level of adherence with appointment dates and completion rate by different routine

Intervention and Control groups, respectively, com-
pleted required vaccination at the end 14th week of thestudy ( Kazi et al. , 2018 ). Another study demonstrated
that 97.0% in the intervention group and 82.0% in the
non-intervention group completed immunizations at 6
weeks, and 95% and 75%, respectively, at 14 weeks(Bangure et al., 2015 ). Of special note in this study is the
increased rates of appointment keeping and completionamong infants in the intervention group (55.3% for
measles and 75.9% for yellow fever). The immunization
coverage in previous national surveys for measles in2003, 2008 and 2013 were 35.9%, 41.4% and 42.1%,respectively.
The finding which showed that the Control group
had significantly higher coverage than the Intervention
group in Bauchi and Bayelsa states was unexpected.However, reports from the health facilities where thestudy was conducted revealed that there were some on-going parallel interventions in Bauchi state. The first
was the Maternal and Child Health component of the
Subsidy Reinvestment and Empowerment Programme(SURE-P) in Nigeria, which aspires to contribute to thereduction of maternal mortality and new-born morbid-ity. The other was a WHO-supported programme
known as Routine Immunization Intensification. At the
time the study was conducted, we are unaware of paral-lel interventions going on in the two states, which makesit more likely that the results could be attributed to theintervention. Also, the Intervention LGA in Bayelsa state
experienced flooding during the period that led to the
displacement of some participants, thereby affecting thecompliance rate. This incident posed a challenge to thepresent study.This study has some strengths: first, reminder text
messages were sent timely according to the study proto-col. Second, by enrolling mothers of infants at health fa-cilities, selection bias was minimized compared withwhat would have been if they were enrolled in their vari-ous homes; bearing in mind that routine immunizationcan only be given at health facilities irrespective ofwhere a woman delivered her baby. The positive com-ments of mothers in the intervention group about theSMS messages increasing their awareness ofimmunization dates, assisting them in readjustingtheir time, influencing their completion of the immuni-zations and advocating for the continuation of this pro-gramme lend credence to the value attached to thisinnovation.
There were some limitations to the present study.
First, the authors could not monitor the delivery statusof the SMS messages as it was unidirectional. It will bedesirable in future studies that a link of the delivery sta-tus of sent SMS messages should be established to moni-tor actual delivery to individual receiver. Second, 60questionnaires were inadequately completed (1.7%), butthis did not compromise the quality of data collected asthe minimum sample for the study was obtained in allthe LGAs.
CONCLUSION
This study shows that sending one-way reminder textSMS messages to mothers of infants with phone owner-ship promotes higher full and timely completion of rou-tine childhood immunization. The study thuscontributes to the evidence base on the effectiveness andTable 4: State comparison of immunization completion rate

acceptance of health text messaging for improved child-
hood immunization and variation in different settings.Findings also provided trusted evidence for decision
making for child immunization health outcomes and
services and contributed to the body of literature, which
is currently scarce. Finally, it has provided a better un-
derstanding of the mechanisms through which mobile
phone technology supports community-based health
care delivery.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Based on the findings of this study, the following are rec-ommended for the following agencies of government—
Federal Ministry of Health, the National Primary
Healthcare Development Agency as well as all StatesPrimary Healthcare Development Agencies:
1. Scaling-up this project to build a national body of
evidence with wider geographic spread to other
states in Nigeria for increasing national immuniza-tion coverage.
2. Exploring reminder text messaging as a viable chan-
nel for health education to complement conventional
media messages. This would serve as a reinforcement
of the media messages.
3. Funding should be provided for developing, produc-
ing and distributing training materials manuals/
guidelines to researchers, PHC coordinators and ma-
ternal and child health focal persons to guide the
replication of implementation of this project. And
with adequate support from researchers as part of
their technical contribution in collaboration with
communication experts.
4. Building capacity of frontline health workers nation-
wide on the use of this innovation, and integrating
routine immunization data generated into a national
database.
5. Integrating m-Health strategy by policymakers into
the existing national immunization policy.

ETHICAL APPROVAL
Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the UI/UCH Ethics Review Committee, College of Medicine,University of Ibadan, Nigeria (UI/EC/17/0561). We ob-
tain written informed consent from all the respondents,they are competent, have the liberty and agency to make
an informed decision. Parental or legal guardian consent
to recruit respondents who are 14 years old into thestudy was not necessary; the majority of the respondents
are married, wives, mothers and are in their husbands’
house. ‘Under-aged’ mothers are largely based in theNorthern part of Nigeria; the dominant religion in this
region (Islam) and the Sharia Law allow teenagers as
young as 14 years old girls to be married and become in-dependent of their parents on decisions affecting their
families including their children.
