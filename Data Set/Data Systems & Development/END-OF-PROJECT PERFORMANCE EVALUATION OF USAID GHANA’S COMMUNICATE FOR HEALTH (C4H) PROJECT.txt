 1     |     END-OF-PROJECT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF USAID/ GHANA’S COMMUNICATE FOR HEALTH (C4H) PROJECT  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
This report describes the findings of an end -of-project performance evaluation of Communicate for 
Health, USAID/Ghana’s social and behavior change communication (SBCC) flagship project, conducted 
in June 2019.  
The findings of the evaluation suggest that Communicate for Health has been largely successful in achieving the ob jectives described in the project award and subsequent planning documents. The 
evaluation explored two primary questions, corresponding to Communicate for Health’s expected 
result areas (ERs):  
1. Did Communicate for Health contribute to the uptake of healthy  behaviors?  
2. Which Communicate for Health capacity building interventions appear to have been most impactful with different partners and beneficiary groups, and how can they be replicat ed or 
expanded moving forward?  
The limited data available to the evaluation team did not clearly demonstrate changes in priority behaviors associated with exposure to SBCC interventions developed by Communicate for Health and 
its counterpart organization within the Ghana Health Service (GHS). There were, however, encouraging  
changes in a number of important precursors of health behavior, including interpersonal communication 
about health topics; information- seeking; and intent to adopt recommended behaviors. USAID does not 
intend to support an impact evaluation of Communicate  for Health, so it is likely that any behavioral 
outcomes of the project will remain undocumented. The findings of this evaluation suggest that the SBCC interventions implemented by Communicate for Health were of high quality, however, and that 
any limitat ions to impact were likely a function of the project’s mandate to focus exclusively on mass 
media, which limited reach; potential for reinforcement of key messages; and attention to normative 
drivers of priority behaviors.  
Communicate for Health’s performance in the area of capacity strengthening was exceptional, and 
lessons learned through the project have potential application not only in Ghana, but in other countries in which development partners and governments are working to enhance public sect or leadership in 
SBCC. The project was particularly successful in achieving “systems -level” improvements to Ghana’s 
SBCC landscape through changes to policy; health management information systems; human resource management; and coordination functions withi n the GHS, implying potential for sustained results. While 
these gains are the culmination of longstanding investment by USAID and other donors in SBCC in 
Ghana, the focused and intensive efforts of Communicate for Health were instrumental  in ensuring thei r 
achievement.  
In order to sustain the gains achieved by Communicate for Health, it will be critical for the GHS to invest in SBCC structures and programming at the national and sub -national levels. Such investment will 
require strategic advocacy and resource mobilization within the Government of Ghana and the country’s private sector, in addition to private foundations and (to a decreasing extent) bilateral donors. USAID/Ghana and the GHS may wish to consider investment in community -level SBCC structures a nd 
programming, with attention to both normative drivers of health behavior and improved utilization of SBCC principles and approaches in the context of health service delivery.  END-OF-PROJECT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF USAID/ GHANA’S COMMUNICATE FOR HEALTH (C4H) PRO JECT |     2 PRIMARY PURPOSE  
The primary purpose of the performance evaluation of Communica te for Health is to inform strategies 
for future USAID investments in SBCC activities. The primary audience for the evaluation findings is 
USAID/Ghana, USAID implementing partners, the Government of Ghana (GoG), and other SBCC and 
health promotion stakehol ders in Ghana.  
INTRODUCTION  
Ghana has made notable progress in health outcomes over the last two decades; however, challenges 
remain for the country to meet its goal of universal health coverage. Data from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (DHS)  and the 2017 Maternal Health Survey (MHS) show significant but 
uneven progress in improving health status.  
USAID recognizes the importance of social and behavior change (SBC) in improving health -seeking 
behaviors and the social norms that enable them. SBC  is grounded in a number of different disciplines, 
including social and behavior change communication (SBCC), marketing, advocacy, behavioral economics, or human -centered design. USAID/Ghana designed Communicate for Health to address key 
individual and nor mative determinants of priority healthy behaviors, including both household behaviors 
and service utilization.  
Communicate for Health is a five- year (November 2014 to November 2019), USAID-funded 
cooperative agreement (AID -641-A-15- 00003; TEC $18,000,000)  awarded in 2014 and led by FHI360 in 
partnership with sub recipients Viamo, Creative Storm Network, Mullen Lowe and the Ghana Community Radio Network.  
Communicate for Health is one of six activities designed to work together under the USAID/Ghana’s 
Healt h System’s Strengthening (HSS) portfolio to achieve equitable improvement in the health status of 
Ghanaians. It is mandated to design and implement mass or “above -the-line” media, including radio, 
television, and print, with focused attention to strengthen ing the capacity of the public sector and civil 
society SBCC partners through “learning -by-doing” and other evidence -based approaches. 
Communicate for health is a national program with targeted efforts in the Northern, Volta, Western, 
Central and Greater Accra regions. The project has three expected results:  
• Expected Result 1: Improved behavior change.  
• Expected Result 2: Ghana Health Service (GHS)/Health Promotion Division (HPD) capacity strengthened.  
• Expected Result 3: Capacity of one SBCC local organizati on developed and strengthened to 
receive direct USAID funding.

Figure A. Communicate for Health Results Framework 
Communicate for Health’s areas of focus include family planning (FP); maternal, newborn, and child 
health (MN CH); nutrition; WASH; malaria prevention, control and case management; and the 
prevention and management of HIV/AIDS.  
METHODOLOGY  
USAID/Washington conducted an internal performance evaluation of Communicate for Health’s 
progress from June 15 -28, 2019. The evaluation questions were:  
1. Did the project contribute to the uptake of healthy behaviors? Which behaviors were adopted as a result of the project and why or why not?  
2. What gender dynamics and considerations, either positive or negative, were addressed in 
the implementation of the project and how did the project address them?  
3. What support was the project able to provide other USAID implementing partners in their 
SBCC activities, and what were the results of this support? What were the challenges? 
4. What manage ment approaches, at USAID or the prime partner, enabled or impeded the 
achievement of the project’s objectives?  
5. Which capacity building interventions appear to have been most impactful with different 
partners and beneficiary groups, and how can they be replicated or expanded moving 
forward? What specific competencies were developed within HPD, implementing partners, and local SBCC organizations?  
The evaluation was conducted by a team of four staff from USAID/Washington’s Bureau for Global Health: Senior SBC Technical Advisors Hope Hempstone and Kama Garrison; Gender Advisor Afeefa Abdur- Rahman; and Program Assistant Sylvie Perkins.  
END-OF-PROJECT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF USAID/ GHANA’S COMMUNICATE FOR HEALTH (C4H) PRO JECT |     4 This evaluatio n was comprised of a comprehensive desk review and extensive key informant interviews 
and focus group discussions. Available behavioral data collected by Communicate for Health through 
Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology was also reviewed and synth esized.  
The evaluation team employed a modified version of Outcome Harvesting, a qualitative evaluation 
methodology that seeks to capture both intended and unintended outcomes in its assessment of 
capacity strengthening outcomes. Outcome Harvesting identi fies key outcomes of a project after a 
thorough review of existing documentation - in this case, project outputs and relevant Government of 
Ghana documents (see Annex E for a list of documents reviewed).  The Outcome Harvesting process then requires the ev aluators to work backward to assess the contribution of the project toward each 
outcome and define the importance of the outcome. After completing the harvest, the evaluation team 
verifies the outcomes with knowledgeable external sources in order to obtain  the final list of vetted 
outcomes. In order to assess the contribution of the project and verify the outcomes, the team conducted 21 key informant interviews and 19 focus group discussions over the course of two weeks, speaking to a total of nearly 100 pr oject stakeholders (See Annex B for a list of stakeholders 
interviewed). Informants included USAID/Ghana, Communicate for Health, Government of Ghana, and implementing partner staff. The majority of time was spent with national partners and stakeholders, b ut 
two-day site visits were conducted in Tamale (Northern Region) and Ho (Volta Region) to ensure the 
engagement of regional stakeholders (see Annex A for a detailed evaluation schedule).  
The Agreement Officer Representative of Communicate for Health, Sala matu Futa, provided technical 
guidance pertaining to questions the evaluation team had during the evaluation. While Ms. Futa 
accompanied the evaluation team to selected site visits, she was not present during interviews and focus 
group discussions.  Implementing partner staff also supported the evaluation team by providing documentation and information about project implementation.  
The review team encountered one major challenge in its work, which may be considered a limitation. The evaluation was not stru ctured to measure population behavior change due to time, funding and 
sampling constraints.  In addition, one key informant, Dr. George Amofah (Former Deputy Director 
General/GHS), has a longstanding contractual relationship with Communicate for Health.  
It should be noted that there are important internal evaluation activities planned for the final two 
quarters of the project; the results of the final IVR survey and capacity strengthening evaluation should 
be attached to this report for purposes of the publ ic record and revisited for the next design.  [Now 
attached in Annexes F, G , and H].  
FINDINGS 
The collective investments of the GHS, USAID, and other development partners in SBCC over more 
than two decades have produced an unusually favorable environment  for future programming in Ghana. 
Growing GHS commitment; technically and operationally capable local suppliers of SBCC services; and sources of SBCC professional education suggest that with strategic investment of continued support, this foundation may be  expanded into a fully functional SBCC system (see Figure B for a visual depiction 
of the components of such a system).  
In general, Communicate for Health has successfully achieved the objectives described in the project award and subsequent planning documents. The prime partner and its subrecipients have intentionally 5     |     END-OF-PROJECT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF USAID/ GHANA’S COMMUNICATE FOR HEALTH (C4H) PROJECT  and successfully built upon past USAID 
investments in SBCC, introducing a level of effort 
and focus that has enabled achievement of a 
number of significant results within a relatively short period. Communicate for Health’s 
achievements in the area of capacity strengthening 
are particularly noteworthy: despite a relatively modest level of funding,  the project has affected a 
large number of changes to structures supporting SBCC within the health system, which implies potential for sustained improvements in the scale 
and quality of programming.  Due in large part to 
Communicate for Health’s efforts, the GHS/HPD is equipped to assume an expanded role in 
coordination, design, implementation, and 
measurement of activities moving forward - if the 
Division is able to assume a role of proactive and 
strategic leadership. Stakeholders within the GHS 
and the d evelopment community commented on 
this continued need for proactivity and vision; as 
one respondent said, “They are always reacting...now they need to anticipate and lead.” 
Both GHS/HPD and Ghanaian providers of SBCC services with whom Communicate for Heal th 
partnered have expressed frustration that project activities were not transitioned to their control 
earlier in the life of the project, and that they were not given the opportunity to lead more project 
activities. While these concerns are valid, they mu st be considered with certain caveats in the context of 
Communicate for Health’s performance, most notably that refurbishment of Korle Bu was not part of 
the original scope. The refurbishment required substantial time, effort and flexibility, delaying the 
timelines for implementation and capacity building. It also, however, reflected the continuous adaptability and responsiveness of Communicate for Health.  
Despite the many gains achieved by Communicate for Health and HPD, the GHS does not appear prepared t o fund SBCC or health promotion activities at any significant level in the near term. It appears 
that both basic operating expenses of HPD and continued implementation of the GoodLife campaign will 
be in immediate jeopardy with the cessation of USAID support through Communicate for Health.   
GOODLIFE CAMPAIGN AND OTHER MASS MEDIA OUTPUTS  
This evaluation considered Communicate for Health’s achievements against project Expected Results (ERs). It is important to recognize, however, that these results are inher ently linked and mutually 
reinforcing, and cannot truly be understood in isolation. Communicate for Health’s emphasis on 
learning -by-doing as a capacity strengthening strategy render it difficult to draw a meaningful distinction 
between “direct implementat ion” and capacity strengthening. For this reason, activities associated with 
ER 1 (including the design and implementation of the GoodLife campaign) should be considered not only in terms of improvement in key behavioral outcomes, but improvement in instit utional and individual 
capacity to design, implement, and monitor effective SBCC programming.  
Figure B. Public Sector SBCC Competencies, HC3 in 
Action Briefer.  END-OF-PROJECT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF USAID/ GHANA’S COMMUNICATE FOR HEALTH (C4H) PRO JECT |     6 The quality of SBCC produced by Communicate for Health and its partners is excellent. The shared 
efforts of Communicate for Health, HPD, and creative partners suc h as Mullen Lowe have produced a 
compelling, durable brand for GHS’ health promotion activities going forward. Desktop review of selected GoodLife campaign materials suggests that they reflect GoodLife’s key brand promise; address important determinants of  health behavior; and are targeted to primary audiences. The design and 
production quality of outputs is consistently high. Interactive Voice Response (IVR) survey data collected by Communicate for Health suggests that exposure to GoodLife media outputs am ong primary 
audiences increased over the life of the project, with more than 70% of those surveyed reporting some 
exposure to the campaign in midline surveys.  
THE GOODLIFE BRAND I S DISTINCT, COMPELLING, AND WIDELY ACCEP TED AS AN INITIATIVE  OF THE 
HPD.  
In 2016, the project launched the refreshed GoodLife, Live it Well campaign. The campaign employs a 
life stage approach, addressing the perspectives and concerns of four distinct audience segments. The 
refreshed brand emphasizes collective responsibility for health and empowers different audiences to 
make health “an everyday thing” - a habit that can bring happiness and peace of mind. The refreshed 
brand builds upon the foundation established by the USAID- funded Behavior Change Support project 
(2009- 2013), which initially supported GHS in developing the GoodLife brand in 2010.  Stakeholders 
acknowledged the pre -existing association between GHS and the GoodLife brand, and appreciated that 
the Communicate for Health -led refresh built from this. The GoodLife brand  and associated campaigns 
are widely recognized as an improvement upon past SBC efforts by the GHS; stakeholders consistently noted improved clarity in messaging and increased creativity and brand appeal. The GoodLife brand 
manual is recognized by HPD as k ey to maintenance of the brand and development of new outputs.  
There is a deeply held sense of ownership of the GoodLife brand within HPD, and wide recognition of 
the brand within GHS more broadly. Endorsements of various GoodLife products and activities by GoG 
decision -makers, including the recent endorsement of the GoodLife Slice of Life campaign by First Lady 
Rebecca Akufo -Addo, are widely cited as evidence of GoG/GHS ownership of the campaign. A limited 
number of stakeholders reported that GoodLife cont inues to be associated primarily with USAID within 
the development community. This perception may be reinforced, in part, by the fact that sub -national 
campaign activities are concentrated in USAID priority regions.  
WHILE THE GOODLIFE B RAND AND ASSOCIATED CAMPAIGNS ARE INFORM ED BY BEHAVIORAL 
THEORY AND INSIGHTS DERIVED FROM FORMATI VE RESEARCH, THIS TH EORY OF CHANGE HAS N OT 
BEEN DOCUMENTED IN A N EASILY ACCESSIBLE FORMAT - LIMITING POTENTIAL F OR TRANSFER OF 
DESIGN CAP ACITY TO THE HPD; ALIGNMENT ACROSS PARTN ERS; OR ADAPTATION OF  PRODUCTS 
TO LOCAL CONTEXTS.  
Evidence has demonstrated that effective behavior change programming is premised upon clearly defined 
behavioral objectives, with attention to the major drivers of a given behavior among each primary 7     |     END-OF-PROJECT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF USAID/ GHANA’S COMMUNICATE FOR HEALTH (C4H) PROJECT  audience.1  An analysis of select GoodLife outputs confirms a clear focus on specific behaviors among life 
stage audiences, with particular emphasis on increasing knowledge and perceptions of social support for 
priority behaviors. Intermediary behaviors such as i nterpersonal communication around health and 
health information -seeking are emphasized throughout.  
Despite evidence of an implicit theory of change throughout GoodLife outputs, this framework is not explicitly documented. The evaluation team was unable to  identify a single, concise description of 
Goodlife’s theory of change, with articulation of the presumed linkages between specific behaviors, life 
stage audiences, and behavioral drivers (or determinants). Program documentation cites a variety of 
behavior al determinants, which vary from one source to another. Furthermore, many program 
documents seem to focus in large part on proximal determinants (intermediary behaviors) such as 
interpersonal communication and information -seeking, and do not clearly describe the distal 
determinants (e.g. knowledge, self -efficacy, outcome expectations, subjective norms, social support) that 
are believed to influence each behavior of interest. While the original Request for Application did not require a formal and explicit Theory of Change, the lack of a clear and consistent theory of change may 
limit the ability of HPD and other GHS staff to design or adapt impactful GoodLife products moving 
forward. It may also serve to reinforce a tendency commonly seen in public sector health promotion structures to focus on provision of information (health education) rather than more targeted efforts to 
shift key determinants of specific behaviors.  
The lack of a consistent theory of change also serves to undermine Communicate for Health’s 
monitoring and evaluation efforts: determinants cited in program documents are not consistently 
measured in internal or external evaluations, making it difficult to  infer a causal relationship between 
exposure, change in determinant, and change in behavior. Lastly an explicit theory of change may have 
allowed the project to better illustrate the disconnect between the design of the project and expected 
outcomes.  
GOO DLIFE RELIES PRIMARI LY (ALTHOUGH NOT EXC LUSIVELY) ON AN ADVE RTISING MODEL 
EMPHASIZING SHORT -FORMAT MASS MEDIA AN D PRINT MATERIALS. THIS ORIENTATION MAY LIMIT 
THE CAMPAIGN ’S REACH AND ABILITY TO ADDRESS SOCIAL AN D NORMATIVE DRIVERS OF HEALTH 
BEHAVIOR.  
The t erms of Communicate for Health’s award and subsequent management guidance from 
USAID/Ghana required an exclusive focus on mass (or “above -the-line”) media, with an estimated 50% 
of total project funding allocated towards direct program costs for communication activities (design and 
production of mass media, radio spots, print materials). This requirement effectively limited the potential 
reach of GoodLife, given the crowded media market in Ghana’s urban centers and inconsistent 
penetration of television and radio in some rural areas. Subsequent design decisions favored short-
format outputs such as 60 -second spots. Experience in Ghana and elsewhere has demonstrated that this

not be sufficient to shift underlying social and normative influences of some health behaviors .2 
Communicate for Health’s long- format media programs (including a regionally -specific GoodLife radio 
serial and the YOLO youth platform) and multi- channel pilot projects (including partner Ghana 
Community Radio Network’s youth -focused FP/RH program and the Community Engagement for 
Malaria Prevention program), offer potential for deeper attention to these factors, but will not be widely 
implemente d or evaluated during the life of the project.  
Many stakeholders at the regional and district levels associated the GoodLife brand primarily with 
posters and radio spots, and noted that these formats were unlikely to assist them in their work. The 
introduc tion of a comprehensive set of GoodLife cue cards and video “roll shows” for facility waiting 
rooms during the final months of the project will likely address this need to a certain extent in targeted 
geographies.  
Across all stakeholders, there exists a st rongly felt need for renewed focus on community -level SBCC. 
One senior leader within HPD noted, “Our [mass media] work is always hanging...we cannot reinforce our messages." This sentiment was echoed unanimously by district health promotion officers, one o f 
whom noted, "You cannot use mass media without anyone to talk about it!” GHS leadership, HPD staff, 
and other stakeholders noted that existing health promotion structures focus heavily upon community 
entry and engagement with community leadership rather than targeted, evidence -based behavior change 
activities, and expressed the hope that future donor investment would support improved scale and 
quality of community -level activities. 
GOODLIFE ’S LIFE STAGE -BASED AUDIENCE SEGME NTATION APPROACH, WH ICH REFLECTS  
ESTABLISHED BEST PRA CTICE IN INTEGRATED SBC PROGRAMMING, IS WIDELY APPRECIATED A S BOTH 
NOVEL AND INTUITIVE.  
GoodLife is premised upon a life stage -based segmentation approach that promotes priority behaviors 
relevant to 1) pregnant couples; 2) parents and  caregivers of children under 5; 3) adolescents; and 4) 
young adults in relationships. This model, which is common in integrated (multi- health element) SBCC 
programs worldwide, allows for establishment of seamless and intuitive linkages between different h ealth 
areas in a single behavior change intervention. Stakeholders familiar with the design of GoodLife, including HPD staff, GHS leadership, creative partners, and USAID implementing partners active in 
SBCC, praised this segmentation approach as a departure from past practice in GHS -supported behavior 
change efforts. Health promotion staff at the regional and district levels and partners less steeped in 
behavior change did not demonstrate the same level of awareness of GoodLife’s life stage segments; this 
likely represents an opportunity for improved alignment of partner activities and enhancement of 
community- level behavior change moving forward.

Review of Public Health 29 (1). pp 219- 234. 9     |     END-OF-PROJECT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF USAID/ GHANA’S COMMUNICATE FOR HEALTH (C4H) PROJECT  THERE ARE INHERENT C ONFLICTS BETWEEN USA ID’S PRIORITIES AND THOSE OF THE GHS, WHICH AT 
TIMES IMPEDED COMMUNICAT E FOR HEALTH’ S ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY FULFILL ITS 
MANDATE.  
Many stakeholders perceived a tension between USAID/Ghana’s priorities for Communicate for Health 
and those of the GHS/HPD. Examples of this are to be found in GHS’ desire to addres s life stage 
audiences (the elderly) and health areas (non -communicable diseases such as diabetes) that are not 
prioritized by USAID in its health investments; and GHS’ emphasis on national health days, which have not been shown to contribute meaningfully to health behavior change outcomes such as those included 
in Communicate for Health’s results framework. Communicate for Health accommodated GHS priorities to the extent possible, but was unable to fully satisfy GHS requests in some cases. Similarly, Commu nicate for Health’s mandate to focus in USAID priority regions was not appreciated by GHS 
leadership, although the project’s national -level mass media programming offsets this critique to a 
certain extent.  
USAID/Ghana’s insistence on final review of Commun icate for Health outputs was widely seen as 
undermining the authority of the Health Sector SBCC Technical Review Committee (itself established by Communicate for Health) and the HPD. Integration of USAID feedback within the Review Committee process will likely reinforce both the role of the HPD and GHS ownership of GoodLife outputs moving 
forward.  
WHILE THERE IS LITTLE CLEAR EVIDENCE FOR  THE BEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES OF THE GOODLIFE 
CAMPAIGN AT THIS POI NT, THERE ARE ENCOUR AGING IMPROVEMENTS I N KEY PRECURSORS TO 
HEALTH BEHAVIOR CHANG E, SUCH AS INTERPERS ONAL COMMUNICATION AND INTENTION.  
C4H monitored the adoption of key behavior using Interactive Voice Responses (IVR) technology 
whereby pre -recorded content in multiple local languages prompts users to listen to que stions and press 
buttons on their phone to respond. IVR data, while an innovative solution to the limitations C4H faced within the monitoring and evaluation budget, is only able to reflect trends from baseline to follow up.  A few trends to note:  
As was hi ghlighted before, the data suggests an increase in the awareness of the GoodLife, Live it Well 
brand from 61% at baseline to 71% at follow up, surpassing the project target of 70% (Annex C).  
Additionally, it appears that more respondents were exposed to fa mily planning messages at follow- up 
(72%) than at baseline (58%). And, for facility delivery messages, the data shows an increased exposure from baseline (60%) to follow up (73%). For WASH messages, there was an increase for exposure to any handwashing mes sage from 65% to 79% (Annex C).  
Interpersonal Communication, (IPC) an indication of potential behavior change, shows marked increases from the baseline to the follow up survey. Interpersonal communication on delaying pregnancy for sexually active particip ants suggests an increase from 50% at baseline to 58% at follow up. IPC on 
delaying pregnancy for sexually inactive participants shows a suggestive increase from participants from 36% at baseline to 44% at follow up. And, IPC for ITN use shows an increase from 46% at baseline to 59% at follow up. There were also increases in IPC for WASH (62% -67% and facility delivery (47% -67%) 
(Annex C).  END-OF-PROJECT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF USAID/ GHANA’S COMMUNICATE FOR HEALTH (C4H) PRO JECT |     10 While this data is reflective of trends and not actual behavior change, the results are promising.  
Overall, it is likely that GoodLife’s behavioral impact will be limited not by the quality of its outputs, but 
by the difficulty of a) achieving sufficient levels of exposure among primary audiences given Ghana’s 
media landscape; and b) inherent limitations of a SBCC program  that does not reinforce mass media 
messages through community -level activities. These factors are functions of USAID’s design of the 
mechanism, rather than Communicate for Health’s performance.  
Some stakeholders also noted that achieving behavioral outcom es would likely require increased 
attention to specific health areas through nested vertical campaigns (such as the successful Second Year 
of Life Services, or 2YL, campaign) under the broader GoodLife platform. This need was most frequently 
cited in relat ion to family planning and reproductive health.  
A monitoring survey planned by Communicate for Health in the final months of the project will likely 
yield additional information regarding the reach of the GoodLife campaign and potential outcomes on 
both behavioral precursors (determinants) and behaviors of interest.  
THERE IS A NEED FOR CONTINUED TRUST- BUILDING BETWEEN THE  HPD AND PROVIDERS OF  SBC 
SERVICES (E.G. CREATIVE AGENCIES, BEHAVI OR CHANGE -FOCUSED NGOS) TO ENABLE REGULAR AND 
EFFECTIVE COLLABORAT ION. 
The highly participatory processes involved in the refresh of the GoodLife brand; development and 
production of mass media outputs; and launch and maintenance of key GoodLife platforms have provided many formal and informal opportunities for collaboration between the HPD and providers of SBCC services within Ghana’s private sector and civil society. Stakeholders appreciate both the learning 
and the relationship -building that has occurred as a result of these exchanges - but acknowledge that the 
cultures, mot ivations and ways of working in the public and private sectors are sometimes at odds. 
Continued cultivation of Ghana’s SBCC ecosystem will likely require ongoing trust - and relationship -
building, and acknowledgement of the comparative advantages and distin ct roles of different stakeholder 
groups.  
YOLO ’S FORMAT AND POPULAR ITY SUGGEST POTENTIAL FOR BEHAVIORAL IMP ACT AMONG YOUNG 
PEOPLE, BUT ADDITIONAL EVALUATION IS REQUIRED.  
The YOLO youth platform, which includes a television serial drama and (periodically) moderated social 
media and roadshow events, has been supported by Communicate for Health since 2017 (two prior 
seasons of the television show were supported by DFID via the National Population Council and 
Palladium, respectively). The television show repre sents a continuation of The Things We Do for Love, 
a popular serial drama developed by Farmhouse Media in the 1990’s. In its five seasons on air, YOLO 
has proved immensely popular, achieving an average of four million viewers weekly on television (TV3) 
by the end of season four and over 6 million views of season four on YouTube. The platform is 
characterized by a seamless; bi -directional interface between television and social media, which 
simultaneously drives viewership; increases audience engagement; and provides content developers with 
a continued source of audience insights. YOLO employs the entertainment education methodology popularized by Miguel Sabido, modeling desired behaviors through the evolution and interaction of a 
range of relatable teenage and adult characters. As such, it attempts to address a wide range of 
behavioral determinants, including both individual and social and normative drivers of health behaviors. 11     |     END- OF-PROJECT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF USAID/ GHANA’S COMMUNICATE FOR HEALTH (C4H) PROJECT  Communicate for Health and Farmhouse Media have successfully linked YOLO and the G oodLife 
campaign by embedding GoodLife messages and spots within YOLO and creating a shared tagline 
(“YOLO, You Only Live Once – GoodLife, Live it Well”), thereby expanding GoodLife’s reach and 
influence among young people. YOLO’s format and popularity sug gest that it has potential to achieve 
behavioral impact if implemented at sufficient scale with linkages between mass media and other channels and availability of health products and services.  
The range of stakeholders involved in the development and production of YOLO, together with the 
program’s evolving sources of funding, afford an important opportunity to model public -private 
partnership in SBCC. The National Population Council's long standing support for the platform, in particular, offers a degree of  visibility and high -level GoG support that must be maintained.  
COMMUNICATE FOR HEAL TH AND ITS PARTNERS SUCCESSFULLY LEVERAGED THEIR RELATIONSHI PS 
WITH MEDIA OUTLETS T O SECURE A SIGNIFICA NT LEVEL OF DONATED AIRTIME, WHILE 
STRENGTHENING THE CA PACITY OF THE HPD TO EFFECTIVELY N EGOTIATE MEDIA BUYS IN FUTURE. 
Communicate for Health has been very successful in negotiating donations and price reductions in 
airtime for GoodLife and YOLO, exceeding its required level of cost share ($2.7M) by Quarter 2 of 
Year 5. Si gnificant additional cost share is expected during the remaining months of the project, given 
that YOLO/Season 5 is currently being aired on TV3 at no cost to Communicate for Health, and airtime 
for malaria/IPTp spots developed by the project will be purchased by the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS, 
Tuberculosis, and Malaria. Private sector media houses with which Communicate for Health has worked report that the quality of the programming offered by the project was instrumental in securing free 
airtime. While HPD  staff report increased success in negotiating airtime purchases based on the 
approach modeled by Communicate for Health, it will be critical that high standards of quality are 
maintained if the GHS is to secure airtime in the future.  
HPD LACKS AN EFFICIE NT, FORMAL SYSTEM FOR DISTRIBUTION OF SBCC MATERIALS, AND THE 
AVAILABILITY OF MATE RIALS AT THE DISTRICT AND COMMUNITY LEVE LS IS INCONSISTENT.  
It appears that the distribution of Communicate for Health outputs is largely opportunistic; and while 
there is space to store materials, it is not clear how HPD will distribute print materials or other 
resources for regional and district -level activities moving forward. The HPD building at Korle Bu and 
nascent regional health promotion resource centers offer space for  secure storage of resources, 
assuming a system for their distribution can be established and enforced.  
NEITHER INTERNAL NOR EXTERNAL EVALUATION ACTIVITIES ALLOWED F OR ACCURATE 
MEASUREMENT OF RELEV ANT BEHAVIORAL OUTCO MES, LIMITING UNDERS TANDING OF 
COMMUNICATE FOR HEAL TH’S IMPACT.  
Communicate for Health was neither mandated nor funded to conduct an outcome evaluation of the GoodLife campaign and other mass media programs; instead, USAID/Ghana recommended that these 
outcomes be measured either through a broader evaluation of health s ector investments conducted by 
the Evaluate for Health mechanism, or via comparative analysis of DHS data. In reality, neither of these 
approaches enables appropriate measurement of the impact(s) of SBCC interventions such as those 
supported by Communicate  for Health. The surveys conducted by Evaluate for Health focus primarily 
on measurement of facility -level outcomes, which fails to capture the true impact of a program such as END-OF-PROJECT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF USAID/ GHANA’S COMMUNICATE FOR HEALTH (C4H) PRO JECT |     12 GoodLife. The DHS is not generally recommended for measuring impact of SBC prog rams as a) it does 
not allow for attribution due to lack of exposure measures; and b) it does not consistently measure 
relevant behaviors or determinants.  
While Communicate for Health attempted to approximate an internal outcome evaluation through 
interact ive voice response (IVR) and omnibus surveys, design limitations rendered it difficult to draw 
conclusions regarding behavior change. It should be noted, however, that Communicate for Health’s use of IVR surveys has produced valuable lessons learned for us e of such surveys as a rapid, cost -effective 
SBCC monitoring tool, and strengthened the capacity of HPD and project partners to collect and 
analyze such surveys. This approach has broad potential applicability in USAID -supported SBCC 
programs elsewhere in the region.  
THERE IS LITTLE EVID ENCE OF PLANNED INVE STMENT IN GOODLIFE, YOLO, OR OTHER 
COMMUNICATE FOR HEAL TH MASS MEDIA OUTPUTS FOLLOWING THE CONC LUSION OF PROJECT 
ACTIVITIES IN SEPTEM BER 2019.  
With the exception of two activities (Ghana Community Radio Network’s youth program, which may be implemented through November 2019 by prior agreement with USAID/Ghana, and a forthcoming 
IPTp campaign, for which airtime will be funded by the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS, TB, and Malaria), Communicate for Health’s mass m edia programming will cease to air in September 2019. While HPD is 
assured a minimum level of funding as a department within GHS, it is not clear what level of programming, if any, this would support.  
GENDER INTEGRATION  
In its application for Communicate for Health, FHI360 proposed employing a tested gender integration framework as an internal guide for incorporating a gender -equitable approach into all activities, with the 
aim of “[promoting] gender transformative approaches to examine, question, and change rigid gender 
norms and the imbalance of power that affect both men and women’s health behavior.” While C4H 
addressed gender dynamics in its programming and M&E, these efforts were likely not comprehensive or systematic enough to yield sustained change in either health behavior or institutional capacity.  
LACK OF ATTENTION TO KEY GENDER -RELATED DETERMINANTS  OF HEALTH BEHAVIOR M AY HAVE 
LIMITED THE GOODLIFE  CAMPAIGN ’S IMPACT.  
Communicate for Health successfully designed messages and materials that challenged  inequitable 
gender norms around caregiving and household roles.  It did not, however, address other gender -related 
norms that impact health behavior, such as shared decision- making and couple communication. 
Addressing these determinants, which have been s hown to impact a wide range of health- seeking 
behaviors, is key to affecting and maintaining health behaviors at the population level.  
THE GOODLIFE CAMPAIG N ENGAGED MEN TO IMP ROVE HEALTH SEEKING BEHAVIOR WITHIN 
FAMILIES, BUT CAMPAIGN MESSAGING MAY HAV E INADVERTENTLY VALIDATE D OR REINFORCED 
INEQUITABLE POWER RE LATIONS WITHIN COUPL ES. 
To facilitate health seeking behavior by women and within families, the GoodLife encouraged male support for women’s health; equitable caregiving responsibilities; and shared r esponsibility for healthy 13     |     END- OF-PROJECT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF USAID/ GHANA’S COMMUNICATE FOR HEALTH (C4H) PROJECT  behavior among men and women and boys and girls. Monitoring data shows that among priority 
audiences, campaign efforts may have increased equitable attitudes around these roles. On the one hand, 
this type of messaging encourages m en to be supportive of their partners (e.g. by going with them for 
family planning services and/or antenatal care visits). On the other hand, it does not address the 
underlying power dynamics that increase women’s agency in health (e.g. joint decision maki ng, more 
equitable couple communication). As a result, some campaign messages are gender accommodating (i.e. acknowledging men’s control in household decision -making, but not working to address i t).
3   Given 
potentially gender exploitative practices at the  health facility level (i.e. prioritizing women with male 
partners for health services), Goodlife messaging that does not address decision -making and couple 
communication may risk reinforcing men’s control over the decision -making process and undermining 
women’s ability to act as gatekeepers of their own health.4 Further evidence would be required to 
determine any unintended consequences of the male engagement approach of The Good Life campaign.  
SBCC DESIGN AND IMPL EMENTATION AND CAPAC ITY STRENGTHENING AC TIVITIES ARE NOT 
PREMISED UPON A DEFINED APPROACH TO GEND ER INTEGRATION - RESULTING IN AD HOC 
ATTENTION TO GENDER.  
While Communicate for Health conducted project -level gender analysis and one training, and has 
explored gender norms and dynamics in its SBCC design activities, it is unclear whether the project uses 
gender integration frameworks or other resources to ensure gender is systematically addressed in its 
activities by staff at multiple levels. For example, the project does not have documented princip les for 
operationalizing gender across its three Intermediate Results (IR) s; the GoodLife’s campaign branding 
book does not include gender integration guidelines; and gender review of SBCC materials is intuitive and dependent on the opinions and knowledge of individual reviewers. This dynamic also impacts on 
capacity strengthening activities with project staff, GHS/HPD staff, and with Pro -Link/Infinity970.  For 
example, although highlighted in project documentation as an element of the Change Agent Developm ent Program (CADP) curriculum, many CADP graduates could not adequately describe how 
gender plays a part in SBCC beyond ensuring gender balance in materials, workshops, meetings and 
activities. A more systematic approach to gender integration in SBCC would  sharpen attention to 
gender -related determinants of behavior in concept, message and materials development, as well as 
capacity strengthening activities.  
GENDER INTEGRATION I N SBCC IS NOT VIEWED  AS A PRIORITY BY ALL  PROJECT STAFF OR PAR TNERS.  
Although Com municate for Health addressed gender norms and dynamics in its activities, these efforts 
did not impress upon staff or partners that gender was a priority of the project. Conversations with staff and partners also suggest that many viewed gender as a discrete technical area requiring dedicated 
funding and activities, rather than a critical area of analysis in SBCC design and implementation needed to address barriers to healthy behaviors and/or surface unintended consequences of programming

priority” and that “the mission needs to prioritize funds for gender.”  
SUPPORT TO USAID IMPLEMENTING PARTNERS  
Although USAID/Ghana’s six health bilateral mechanisms  (Systems  for Health; Evaluate for Health; 
Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) for Health; People for Health; and Resiliency in Northern Ghana 
(RING)) were designed to function in coordination, it is not clear to what extent and in what manner 
the Mission has priorit ized alignment across mechanisms. Despite this, Communicate for Health has 
collaborated effectively with other USAID implementing partners in formal and informal ways, allowing 
for a well- integrated health portfolio that is largely absent of redundancies o r inconsistencies in quality 
of programming. Collaboration appears to be largely operational, however, and does not extend to a 
shared, behaviorally- oriented vision for achievement of health objectives.  
USAID/GHANA HEALTH I MPLEMENTING PARTNERS  VALUE COMMUN ICATE FOR HEALTH AS A SOURCE 
OF EXPERT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND AN IN TERMEDIARY IN ENGAGE MENT WITH HPD AND 
MEDIA HOUSES.  
In general, collaboration between Communicate for Health and other USAID/Ghana health implementing partners appears to be positive and productive. Implementing partners value Communicate for Health as a source of technical assistance, guidance, and staff capacity strengthening in 
the area of SBCC. Partners cited a wide variety of discrete and ongoing ways in which Communicate for 
Health f acilitated achievement of project objectives, including collaborative design of health element -
specific media outputs (e.g. WASH radio spots, Chlorhexidine promotional materials) and facilitation of 
review and clearance through the GHS’ SBCC Technical Revi ew Committee. One partner commented: 
“We were able to design and produce [SBCC] materials faster than anyone ever expected, because 
Communicate for Health helped us put together and prepare for our request to the Technical Review 
Committee. What was expect ed to take a year took only three months.”  
OPPORTUNITIES TO DEVELOP AND SOCIALIZE A SHARED STRATEGIC VIS ION FOR SOCIAL AND 
BEHAVIOR CHANGE ACROSS USAID/GHANA HEALT H IMPLEMENTING PARTNERS HAVE NOT BEEN 
FULLY REALIZED.  
While USAID/Ghana implementing partners  are familiar with the GoodLife brand and associated 
campaigns, there does not appear to be a shared strategic vision or framework for social and behavior change across all partners. An agreed -upon series of priority behaviors, and segmented audiences among 
whom those behaviors should be achieved, would likely help align and focus implementing partner 
efforts. While it is not clear that USAID/Ghana intended that Communicate for Health would facilitate 
the development of such a vision among partners, it like ly would have supported stronger alignment of 
efforts, and improved understanding of the role of SBCC throughout the health system.  
THE DESIGN OF USAID/ GHANA ’S CURRENT HEALTH POR TFOLIO DOES NOT SUPPORT FULL AND 
SEAMLESS PROVISION OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE AC ROSS DEMAND- AND SUPPLY -SIDE INVESTMENTS.  
The design and management of USAID/Ghana’s current health portfolio appears to have resulted in 
several important points of disconnect across implementing partners, which together contribute to 
insufficient or inaccurat e budgeting and lack of program coverage. The broadest example of this is to be 15     |     END- OF-PROJECT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF USAID/ GHANA’S COMMUNICATE FOR HEALTH (C4H) PROJECT  found in the lack of attention to community -level behavior change programming for RMNCH or malaria; 
while RING and WASH for Health have been mandated to provide community -level SBCC for nutrition 
and WASH, no partner appears to be providing direct implementation or technical support for such 
work in other health areas. Similarly, the responsibility for production and distribution of print materials, a critical and resource heavy component of SBCC programming, is unclear across USAID implementing 
partners. More than one partner provided examples of SBCC outputs that had been designed (often through collaboration between implementing partners), without either a shared understanding  of which 
partner was responsible for production costs, or sufficient budget for those costs.  
CAPACITY STRENGTHENING  
Communicate for Health has achieved exceptional results in the area of capacity strengthening (project ERs 2 and 3). Despite the fact that  less than 19% of total project funding was allocated to activities 
associated with ERs 2 and 3, Communicate for Health contributed to important gains in systems -, 
organizational -, and individual- level capacity for SBCC in Ghana, with attention to both technical and 
operational aspects of performance. Many of the project’s capacity strengthening results are associated 
with a small number of pivotal activities: establishment and maintenance of coordination and technical 
review committees for SBCC; the refres h of the GoodLife brand; outreach and partnerships with the 
press and media outlets; the development and implementation of three in -service training programs for 
GHS health promotion staff;  the introduction of health promotion indicators into Ghana’s HMIS  system 
(DHIMS II); and a review of the training curriculum for  health promotion cadres at the College of Health and Well- being at Kintampo. Not 
surprisingly, a large proportion of these results were realized in Years 4 and 5 of the project, reflecting th e long period of trust -
building and preparatory work required to affect systems -level change.  
While USAID and other development 
partners (most notably UNICEF) have long 
invested in both direct implementation and capacity strengthening for SBCC in Ghana, 
the efforts of Communicate for Health were 
more focused and comprehensive than other investments . As a result, the project 
was able to build upon existing efforts and achieve or expedite a number of systems -
level improvements that had long eluded the 
GHS in its health promotion programming.  
As one former member of GHS leadership commented, “Eighty p ercent of the changes 
in GHS commitment and capacity we have seen in recent years can be attributed to Communicate for Health.” A detailed list of results attributed to Communicate for Health’s capacity strengthening activities by external stakeholders is to be found in Annex D: Outcome Harvest Results.  
Figure C. SBCC Capacity Ecosystem, HC3 (2016).  END-OF-PROJECT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF USAID/ GHANA’S COMMUNICATE FOR HEALTH (C4H) PRO JECT |     16 Equally important as the gains in technical and operational capacity enabled by Communicate for Health 
are marked improvements in morale and motivation among health promotion staff at the national and 
sub-national levels. Stakeholders consulted for this evaluation consistently remarked upon the improved 
work ethic, empowerment, focus, and assertiveness of HPD staff and regional and district health 
promotion officers due to Communicate for Health. Key informants noted that GHS staff that had 
benefited from Communicate for Health activities “know what [they are] about,” and “can deliver.” 
The sustainability of the gains achieved by Communicate for Health is threatened by the lack of planned 
funding for continued  capacity strengthening among HPD staff or other health promotion cadres within 
the GHS. Changes to HPD leadership, including a new Director and Deputy Directors for Health Communication; Research and Policy; and Advocacy and Social Mobilization offer pote ntial for 
continued organizational strengthening, but may also disrupt some of the gains that have been made in 
recent years. 
THE ELEVATION OF HPD  FROM A DEPARTMENT UN DER THE FAMILY HEALT H DIVISION (FHD) TO A 
DIVISION UNDER THE G HANA HEALTH SERVICES  HAS RA ISED THE PROFILE OF HPD AND IMPLIES 
POTENTIAL FOR SUSTAI NED INVESTMENT IN SB CC BY THE GHS.  
The elevation of HPD to a Division under GHS represents a significant change in the standing of health 
promotion within Ghana’s public sector. Divisional status assures a minimum level of program funding, 
as well as (reportedly) access to GHS vehicles. HPD leadership will be afforded greater voice and 
decision -making power within the GHS than was previously available to them as they will now have 
access to the Direct or General and other Senior GHS Management through the Directors’ Forum. Many 
stakeholders view the change in HPD’s status as a clear reflection of GHS’s growing commitment to health promotion. Divisional status has also raised the profile of health promotion as a discipline and helped to professionalize the image of health promotion staff in HPD and beyond. One interviewee 
commented “They wouldn’t have gotten a division if they hadn’t worked hard.”  Optimism about HPD’s 
newfound status is tempered, however , by widely felt anxiety that the Division will not secure the 
funding it requires to operate.  
GHS is currently recruiting a new Director for HPD, as well as Deputy Directors for the department’s three teams (Health Communication; Research and Policy; and Advocacy and Social Mobilization ). There 
is a widespread recognition among stakeholders that the ability of HPD to maintain gains achieved under 
Communicate for Health will depend in large part on the ability of this cohort of leaders to chart a new 
course  for the division, its staff, and the GHS’s SBCC efforts moving forward.  
CO-LOCATION AT THE HPD OFFICES IN KORLE BU WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN BUILDING TRUST AND 
ENABLING CAPACITY ST RENGTHEN ING THROUGH APPLIED PRACTICE OR  “LEARNING -BY-DOING ”.  
The staff of Communicate for Health have been co -located with HPD at the latter’s building in Korle Bu 
since May 2017. Effective function of this blended team required an extensive refurbishment of the Korle 
Bu building, which was funded by Communicate for Health. While this  refurbishment was costly and 
time-consuming, it is widely credited with enabling HPD staff to carry out daily work functions, and with 
lending HPD a heightened level of credibility within GHS. Many HPD staff also noted that the comfortable work environmen t and equipment afforded them by the renovation served as a source of 
pride and a powerful motivator. The auditorium within the Korle Bu building offers a potential source of 
program income for HPD if appropriately marketed as an event venue to development  partners. Already 17     |     END- OF-PROJECT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF USAID/ GHANA’S COMMUNICATE FOR HEALTH (C4H) PROJECT  key divisions within the GHS including Public Health and other high -profile GHS events are presently 
hosted at the refurbished auditorium.  
The co -location of Communicate for Health with HPD served as an important enabler of capacity 
strengthening and transfer of skills. Co -location enabled the establishment of trust relationships between 
project staff and their HPD counterparts and allowed for continuous, informal collaboration and 
mentoring. As one key informant said, “Suspicion was running high when Communicate for Health staff 
were at Marvel House, but improved once they were working together.”  Another informant noted that “Co-location broke the cycle of formalized TA and allowed for a more organic, hands -on approach.” 
With paired team s for M&E, media and capacity building, HPD and Communicate for Health were able 
to work as co -creators and team members rather than implementing partner and recipient. This allowed 
for a transfer of skills and an overall improvement in work ethic. Within the M&E team specifically, the 
paired teams between HPD and Communicate for Health worked together on the IVR survey’s ethics approval and questionnaire.   
COMMUNICATE FOR HEAL TH’S EFFORTS HAVE YIELD ED SIGNIFICANT IMPRO VEMENTS IN THE 
QUALITY OF MONITORIN G AND EVALUATION FOR S BCC WITHIN HPD AND T HE GHS.  
Many stakeholders identified monitoring and evaluation as an area of particular success for Communicate for Health and HPD, citing capacity improvements at the systems -, organizational -, and 
individual levels . Monitoring and evaluation was one of three areas in which Communicate for Health 
established paired teams between project and HPD staff, and capacity strengthening in this area was grounded in both formal training and continuous learning -by-doing. Commun icate for Health and HPD 
staff collaborated closely on many activities, including formative research for the refresh of the GoodLife brand and campaign; program outcome monitoring; and improvements to Ghana’s HMIS system. HPD monitoring and evaluation staf f are confident in their ability to conduct formative research using Action 
Media and other qualitative approaches, and have successfully facilitated Action Media workshops to inform the design of the GoodLife campaign. They also report increased confidenc e in designing, 
conducting, and analyzing IVR surveys, having been closely engaged in all stages of Communicate for 
Health’s outcome evaluation activities. HPD staff have demonstrated their ability to provide supportive 
supervision at the sub- national leve l, having worked with health promotion officers to validate DHIMS II 
data; synthesize media monitoring data; and ensure completion of monthly and quarterly reports. HPD 
staff are well equipped to provide such supervision moving forward, if they are able to  secure funding 
for travel. Engagement in the Monitoring and Evaluation Community of Practice led by USAID partner 
Evaluate for Health, which began in 2015, was cited by many HPD staff as a particularly valuable 
opportunity for continuous learning and technical exchange.  
Together with UNICEF, Communicate for Health and HPD were able to negotiate the addition of 22 
health promotion indicators within Ghana’s DHIMS II system, and to support health promotion officers 
in collecting and analyzing high quality mon itoring data through staff training, printing of monitoring 
registers, and data quality assurance. The inclusion of such a comprehensive set of health promotion 
indicators within a national HMIS system such as DHIMS II is rare, and represents a significant 
improvement in Ghana’s systems -level capacity to implement high -quality, data- driven programming at 
scale. Health promotion officers at the district and regional levels reported that the availability of 
monitoring data enabled them to better plan activities; coordinate with service delivery colleagues; and END-OF-PROJECT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF USAID/ GHANA’S COMMUNICATE FOR HEALTH (C4H) PRO JECT |     18 advocate for funds within GHS structures. The Word Bank will reportedly cover some costs associated 
with collection of monitoring data (including printing of additional monitoring registers) moving forwa rd. 
COMMUNICATE FOR HEAL TH’S IN-SERVICE CAPACITY STRENGTHENING PROGRAMS FOR HEALTH 
PROMOTION OFFICERS H AVE THE POTENTIAL TO  IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF COMMUNITY -LEVEL 
SBCC PROGRAMMING IF IMPLEMENTED AT SUFFI CIENT SCALE.  
Communicate for Health implemented three in-service capacity strengthening programs for health 
promotion professionals at the regional and district levels, which together benefitted nearly 100 GHS staff.  The Change Agent Development Program (CADP) is an intensive, one -week SBCC course for 
seaso ned health promotion officers. Set for Change (SfC) is a six -day, four -session action -learning 
program targeting new graduates of health promotion degree programs as they begin their service as district health promotion officers. Lastly, the Change Challen ge Fund (CCF) is a competitive 
performance- based grant that provides a small amount of funding to CADP/SfC graduates to design, 
implement, and evaluate an SBCC project, allowing for practical application of skills gained through CADP and SfC. All three pro grams were designed specifically for GHS staff based on capacity 
assessments conducted during Year 1 of Communicate for Health - a fact that was noted and 
appreciated by stakeholders within the GHS. Specific areas of weakness identified during baseline assessments (and emphasized in the programs themselves) included advocacy; community mobilization; 
facilitation and presentation skills; proposal writing and resource mobilization; research, monitoring and 
evaluation, and managing and applying data; and coord ination skills. Entry to all three programs was 
competitive, with up to three times more applicants than spots available; graduates noted that this 
competitive admissions process served as a powerful motivator, and helped to establish their credibility 
as specialized professionals within their own (regional or district) health teams.  
All three programs were universally lauded by graduates; HPD facilitators and mentors; and GHS 
leadership for their success in empowering health promotion staff and enhancing the quality of activities 
at the regional, district, and community levels. GHS staff involved in mentoring and supervision of 
participants in all three programs noted graduates’ increased confidence and improved performance in 
planning, coordination, and a dvocacy with GHS and community leadership. Stakeholders involved in the 
programs unanimously recommended their expansion and institutionalization, with particular emphasis 
on the SfC and CCF programs. HPD staff and regional health promotion officers who ac ted as selection 
committee members, facilitators, mentors, and supervisors for the programs reported that participation helped improve their own understanding of SBCC principles and practices; their facilitation skills; and their confidence in serving as S BCC leaders within the GHS.  
While Communicate for Health conducted one post -assessment of the first cohort the CADP program, 
the SfC and CCF programs have not been evaluated in any systematic manner.  Transition of sustainability for the programs to HPD an d future expansion will likely require both continued attention 
to quality of training and mentoring and evaluation of the programs’ long -term impacts upon the work of 
health promotion officers.  
INTERNSHIPS WITH CREATIVE STORM, MULLEN LOWE AND VIAMO IMPROVED THE TECHNICAL SK ILLS, 
PROFESSIONALISM, AND WORK ETHIC OF PARTIC IPATING HPD STAFF.  
In Years 2017 and 2018, HPD staff completed internships with Communicate for Health partners Creative Storm, Mullen Lowe, and Viamo. These full -time practica, which ranged from two weeks to 19     |     END- OF-PROJECT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF USAID/ GHANA’S COMMUNICATE FOR HEALTH (C4H) PROJECT  three months in length, were intended to provide HPD staff with applied learning in key skill areas, 
including brand development; creative design of mass media outputs; use of IVR and short message 
services (SMS) for information -sharing and monitoring; and use of social media to increase audience 
engagement in SBCC programs. Both HPD leadership and the organizations that hosted interns 
appreciated the value of the internships for transfer of technical skills and relationship building bet ween 
public and private sector entities. Many stakeholders also noted the improved work ethic and professionalism of HPD staff that participated in the program. Former interns appreciated the structure and organization of the internships, which were based upon detailed work plans with clear deliverables, 
but also stressed the need to position the opportunity as a ‘fellowship’ given the skills and professional level of the HPD staff. Some stakeholders, in noting the value of the internships, expressed concer n that 
they would be difficult to institutionalize given lack of a defined (and funded) relationship between HPD 
and private sector providers of SBC services.  
HPD STAFF HAVE EFFEC TIVELY TAKEN OVER MA NAGEMENT OF GOODLIFE ’S SOCIAL MEDIA 
PLATFORMS, BUT THE QUALITY OF THE PLATF ORMS HAS DECREASED A ND THEIR FUTURE IS U NCLEAR.  
In April 2018, four HPD staff members completed three weeks of transition training with Creative 
Storm, after which HPD assumed management of the GoodLife Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram platforms. HPD staff feel strongly that they are capable of managing the GoodLife social media 
platform independently. Some stakeholders raised concerns, however, that they lack the time or 
specialized skills to use the platforms to their full po tential as an integrated, bi- directional campaign 
channel and not simply a communications platform. A review of the GoodLife Facebook page suggests 
these concerns are warranted: since oversight of the page was taken on by HPD in May 2018, the page 
has ceased to function as a compelling, strategy- driven channel for engagement of priority GoodLife 
audiences (including, for example, a Fan of the Week feature and health promotion content), and 
become a communications vehicle for GHS/HPD events and meetings. The quality of photography used 
on the page has decreased markedly during the same period. It is not clear who the intended audience 
of the page is, or what HPD hopes to achieve through it.  
A number of stakeholders reported that the Office of GHS’ Director General had expressed interest in taking over the GoodLife social media platforms from HPD, which simultaneously increases potential for sustainability and inclusion of new content, and raises the specter of dilution of the GoodLife brand.  
WHILE SPECIFIC TECHNICAL COMPETENCIES  AMONG HPD STAFF HAVE  IMPROVED MARKEDLY OVER 
THE PAST FIVE YEARS, THE TEAM HAS NOT YET  SUCCESSFULLY LED THE  DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATI ON, 
AND EVALUATION OF A LARGE -SCALE SBC INITIATIVE . IT IS THEREFORE UN LIKELY THAT HPD IS 
PREPARED TO FUNCTION WITHOUT CONTINUED TECHNICAL SUPPORT IN  THE NEAR TERM.  
HPD staff have been closely involved in all steps of the GoodLife brand refresh and campaign development, and have co -led some activities such as Action Media workshops. They have also 
successfully l ed the design and implementation of focused vertical (i.e. single health area) campaigns, such 
as the immunization- focused Second Year of Life Services, or 2YL, funded by U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control and launched in August 2017 and a refresh of three posters developed by Plan International 
using the Goodlife brand. HPD has not, however, led the design and implementation of a large -scale SBC 
initiative such as the refresh of the GoodLife brand or development of a sector -wide campaign. This may 
be attributed to a number of factors, including delays in Communicate for Health activities due to the END-OF-PROJECT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF USAID/ GHANA’S COMMUNICATE FOR HEALTH (C4H) PRO JECT |     20 time required for the refurbishment of the HPD building in Korle Bu and concerns about HPD staff 
capacity and bandwidth. 
Stakeholders reported that HPD was reasona bly strong in designing print materials, but less so in 
designing or producing television or radio content. Conversations with stakeholders suggests that, given 
sufficient levels of funding and appropriate use of creative contractors, HPD is well -equipped to maintain 
the existing GoodLife brand and design small extension campaigns such as 2YL. Development of larger or more complex campaign elements, or long-format mass media such as the existing GoodLife radio serial drama, would likely require focused tech nical assistance. 
There is continued disagreement as to the appropriate role of the HPD: HPD staff and some GHS leadership argue that the Division has both the mandate and the capacity to conduct all GHS SBCC activities, including creative design and production of print materials and short - and long -format media, 
in-house. Other stakeholders contend that HPD should focus primarily on a leadership and coordination 
role, providing knowledge management and capacity strengthening for staff at the regional and d istrict 
levels. In this scenario, HPD would provide oversight of campaigns and long -format mass media, but 
contract specialized creative firms for design and production services. Experience in other countries suggests, almost without exception, that target ed and intentional contracting out of key elements of 
SBCC programming by the public sector yields the greatest impact and cost -efficiency. 
THE ROLE AND PERCEPTION OF HEALTH PROMOT ION OFFICERS AT THE NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND 
DISTRICT LEVELS HAS BEEN DEFINED AND IMPROVED WITHIN THE GHS, LAYING THE GROUNDWORK 
FOR INCREASED COORDI NATION WITH OTHER CI VIL SERVICE CADRES.  
Position descriptions form the foundation for a strong human resource system and impact many processes such as job postings; recruitment and selection; compensation; requirements for promotion and training; and performance management. Communicate for Healt h assisted HPD to strengthen 
existing position descriptions and identify the skills required for five levels of health promotion officers within the GHS.  In turn, HPD was able to use these position descriptions to define salaries, promotion requirements a nd articulate a career path for health promotion personnel. Additionally, the job 
description clarified the role of Health Promotion staff and other frontline officers within GHS such as Community Health Nurses who also play a role in health promotion.  At  the sub- national level health 
promotion staff reported that they are now recognized as a professional cadre with specialized skills and 
the leaders of the vertical or line programs seek them out to work together.  
SBCC COORDINATION AN D QUALITY ASSURANCE STRUCTURES ESTABLISHED OR REVITALIZED 
THROUGH COMMUNICATE FOR HEALTH HAVE EMPOWERED THE HPD; ENABL ED ALIGNMENT ACROSS 
DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS ; AND IMPROVED THE QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY OF DEMAND -SIDE 
PROGRAMMING IN GHAN A. 
In late 2016, Communicate for Health wor ked with HPD to create an SBCC Technical Review 
Committee (TRC), which was tasked with reviewing all health promotion materials and outputs 
produced in Ghana to ensure technical accuracy; lack of redundancy; and appropriate GHS (GoodLife) branding. Stakeho lders unanimously cited the establishment of this group as a transformative moment 
for both the HPD and SBCC in Ghana. The existence of the TRC, which is chaired by the Family Health Division Director, ensures transparent, efficient, and evidence -based rev iew and approval of materials, 
and supports harmonization of efforts across development partners. It has reinforced the position of 21     |     END- OF-PROJECT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF USAID/ GHANA’S COMMUNICATE FOR HEALTH (C4H) PROJECT  GoodLife as the GHS brand, as all materials cleared by the committee are branded with the GoodLife 
logo, and further solidif ied the role of the HPD as the GoG’s arbiter in matters pertaining to health 
promotion and SBCC. Many stakeholders noted a marked improvement in the quality of health promotion and SBCC materials since the establishment of the TRC. One respondent noted par tners 
"were working in silos prior to this... [partners now] come together in meetings to develop resources 
without duplication." It appears likely that the group will be maintained moving forward, as meetings are 
held at the GHS offices, with any costs co vered by organizations requesting materials review. Some 
stakeholders suggested that TRC meetings could be held more frequently or on a more regular 
schedule, but this perspective did not appear to be widely held.  
Communicate for Health further strengthen ed the coordination of SBCC activities in Ghana through the 
revitalization of the national Interagency Coordination Committee for Health Promotion (ICC) which was established by UNICEF in 2012 but had become largely defunct by 2015.  In addition to revital izing 
the national committee, Communicate for Health supported HPD in establishing three regional ICCs in 
Northern, Western, and Volta regions. Stakeholders repeatedly cited the value of the ICCs as a space 
for communication, trust -building, and coordination across partners. As one respondent commented, 
"The ICC is an important inter -agency structure that has been maintained and led by GHS...it brought a 
lot of people together...should be maintained as their [GHS/HPD] program.” There was, however, concern t hat the ICC would not be sustained after the end of Communicate for Health given lack of 
funding for meetings.  
THE SBCC RESOURCE CE NTER CAN BE A VALUAB LE RESOURCE FOR HPD AND CIVIL SOCIETY HE ALTH 
COMMUNICATION PROFES SIONALS; HOWEVER, A WELL PROMOTED ONLINE  PLATFORM MANAGED 
BY EMPOWERED HPD STA FF AND F ULLY FUNCTIONAL RESO URCE HUBS ARE NECESSARY TO ENSURE 
WIDE -SPREA D ACCESS.  
The national resource center and its online platform provides individuals and organizations working in 
health promotion with access to the latest Ghanaian -focused SBCC materials; provides a central 
location for implementers to share their SBCC materials and resources; and enhances HPD’s position as 
the premier source of SBCC resources in Ghana. Although technically sound, the national reso urce 
center needs to be strategically promoted to increase awareness of the center among intended users in 
the health community and HPD staff need to feel empowered to manage it before transition is 
complete. HPD staff consider themselves skilled in basic operations of the resource center (i.e. loading 
materials on to the online platform, generating data on the usage of the center, basic IT troubleshooting and database management). However, given the looming project close -out date, HPD staff are 
concerned t hey do not have administrative oversight over the administrative and IT functions necessary 
to operate and manage the centers once the project ends. This has implications for the functionality of the center and capacity of HPD to manage and troubleshoot th e system as needed.  
At the regional level, the hubs not only provide district and regional HPD staff with access to the online database but also physical space and equipment for resource constrained health promotion officers to access the internet and the platform for SBCC content and materials in order to collectively research 
and plan for their community engagement activities. However, the functionality of the resource centers 
varies greatly across different regions with some regional hubs up and running and others with limited to no functionality. Additionally, while HPOs working at the regional level appreciate the existence of this 
resource, those working in remote areas continue to be logistically challenged in accessing functional END-OF-PROJECT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF USAID/ GHANA’S COMMUNICATE FOR HEALTH (C4H) PRO JECT |     22 hubs. Ensuring that the national center and regional hubs are fully functional and HPD staff are 
empowered to manage the resource is critical to maximize USAID and HPD’s investment in the center, 
provide the health community with a central location to share and access up -to-date, quality and 
Ghanaian specific SBCC materials, and support regional and district HPOs to fulfill their mandates 
effectively. 
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FOLLOW -ON ACTIVITY  
There is an immediate and critical need to ensure that the important gains achieved unde r 
Communicate for Health are sustained following the end of project activities in September 2019. If possible, USAID/Ghana may wish to consider supporting Communicate for Health in using existing funds to pre -pay discrete operational costs such as internet  connectivity at the Korle Bu building, online 
platform costs associated with the national resource center and regional hubs, and airtime for GoodLife spots and radio drama through early 2020. Parallel to this, it will be essential that the GHS budget appropriately for other operational costs for HPD, as well as routine meeting expenses for the national 
and regional ICCs.  
In the longer term, the evaluation team recommends that USAID/Ghana continue to invest in SBC, through a combination of direct government -to-government support to the GHS/HPD; and focused 
technical assistance from organizations specialized in SBC, including both international partners and local providers of SBCC services.  
The GHS/HPD should be empowered and funded to assume primary leadership of key SBCC and health 
promotion functions, including strengthening national and regional staff to support normative change 
through tailored community engagement and providing strategic direction and oversight of public and private entities engaged in SBC under the Goodlife brand, ensuring that these efforts are technically 
sound, evidence based, audience driven, multi -channeled and operate in sync at national and community 
levels.  
Future investments should prioritize improved quality and increased scal e of community level SBC 
programming reinforced by long format media with attention to intersections between SBC and service 
delivery across key health areas.

“The lack of a consistent theory of change also serves to undermine Communicate for He alth’s 
monitoring and evaluation efforts: determinants cited in program documents are not consistently 
measured in internal or external evaluations, making it difficult to infer a causal relationship between exposure, change in determinant, and change in behavior. Lastly an explicit theory of change may have allowed the project to better illustrate the disconnect between the design of the project and 
expected outcomes.”  
Note: Communicate for Health’s monitoring and evaluation system was limited from the beginning due 
to other competing priorities for mass media -based programing.  Future project designs can and should 
include a requirement for a comprehensive theory of cha nge, an expanded list of indicators to measure 
behavior change and a robust M&E system to record and account for changes in determinants.   
Page 12  
● The GoodLife campaign engaged men to improve health seeking behavior within families, but 
campaign messaging  may have inadvertently validated or reinforced inequitable power relations 
within couples. 
Note: Addressing inequitable power relations and gender norms has been an important consideration 
during the development of mass media programming to the extent p ossible given the short radio and TV 
format used (60- 120 seconds) and the requirement to pack as much information and messaging in 
campaign spots while making the programming relevant and entertaining to the Ghanaian context.  
Programming was vetted by technical and Gender and Social Inclusion (GESI) specialists and rigorously 
pre-tested with audiences prior to broadcast for message fidelity.  Communicate for Health’s longer 
format programming (You Only Live Once —YOLO) and the Maternal Health Channel provided 
opportunities to unpack and address more complex gender and social inclusion norms.     
Follow- on programming and projects should be on constant guard to address potential promotion of 
inequitable power relations in its mass media programming.  It is re commended that future USAID 
project designs for SBC and GESI interventions in Ghana look to directly engage media production houses, the entertainment community and news outlets to proactively address and combat the presentation of gender -based violence an d gender stereotypes.  
Communicate for Health has also recommended to GHS/HPD to include an addendum to the GoodLife 
Brand Manual to address this concern. The addendum will outline clear gender integration guidelines and principles to produce SBCC material s.  
 Page 19  
● HPD staff have effectively taken over management of GoodLife’s social media platforms, but the 
quality of the platforms has decreased and their future is unclear.  
Note:  After the Evaluation, the project worked with the Director General of the GHS and the Acting 
Director of the HPD Division to migrate the GoodLife social media platform and the National SBCC 
Resource Centre which includes an E -Library onto the Govern ment of Ghana’s platform via the END-OF-PROJECT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION OF USAID/ GHANA’S COMMUNICATE FOR HEALTH (C4H) PRO JECT |     66 National Information Technology Agency (NITA). NITA is the Government of Ghana Agency 
responsible for coordinating all Information, Communication Technology ( ICT) needs of Ministries, 
Departments and Agencies.  
With the mig ration process completed and a commitment by the Director General to pick up the costs 
for hosting both initiatives once Communicate for Health comes to a close, there is increasing potential 
for long term sustainability and quality of the GoodLife social media platform.  
Page 21  
“However, given the looming project close -out date, HPD staff are concerned they do not have 
administrative oversight over the administrative and IT functions necessary to operate and manage the 
centers once the project ends. This has implications for the functionality of the center and capacity of 
HPD to manage and troubleshoot the system as needed.”  
Note:  The issue about administrative rights has since been resolved. Additional training for key 
managers was organized in November for eight HPD staff to further strengthen and consolidate their 
capacity to manage the resource center.

 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT S 
 I take this opportunity to express my sincerest thanks to USAID Communicate for Health for the opportunity afforded me to facilitate in aspects of the design and implementation of its capacity building support to the Health Promotion Department. I am extremely grateful for the confidence reposed in me to conduct the endline assessment of the capacity building support to Health Promotion Department. It has been a privilege and a period during which I have learned much in the various roles I played.  
 I thank the officers of Health Promotion Department for the reception they accorded me throu ghout 
the period of my engagement with them. It is my hope that, collectively, we shall all continue to endeavor to make the new Health Promotion Division achieve the objectives for which it was 
created.  
 
I thank all the respondents and persons interviewed from the national, regional and district levels for spending precious time to provide very useful responses and comments that formed the content of 
the report.  
 Special thanks go to Mr. Saul William Evans  of USAID Communicate for Health for providing all the 
documentation that enabled me to complete the assessment.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
 
The main objective of the endline capacity assessment of USAID Communicate for Health’s capacity building support to the Health Promotion Department (HPD) is to determine the level of 
improvement in its technical capacity to develop, design and implement t heory -informed, evidence -
based social and behavior change communication (SBCC) programs.   In 2015, USAID Communicate for Health initiated a capacity building project, which envisaged providing capacity building support to national, regional and district level health promotion staff to 
enable them to deliver on their mandate. In order to achieve this objective, a Capacity Building 
Support Plan (CBSP) was developed.  The CBSP was designed to be an integrated, mutually re -
enforcing technical capacity building plan with core elements initially envisaged to include the 
following:  
1. Change Agent Development Program  (CADP)  
2. The Set for Change (SfC) Action Learning Sets  
3. Internship progra ms for national and/or regional staff to work with USAID Communicate for 
Health cor e partner s to learn elements of SBCC skills on the job  
4. Change Challenge Fund  
5. Co-location : This was conceived within the context of Action Learning where the “Learning by 
Doing Model” was operationalized  
 
METHODOLOGY  
A mixed method, combining qualitative an d quantitative approaches, was adopted for the 
assessment. The process included desk and literature reviews, key informant interviews,  and field 
visits to four of five USAID focus regions, as well as baseline and endline (2019) self- assessments by 
HPD offi cers of their organizational and individual technical capacity improvements , using the same 
outcome assessment tools  as in May– Jun 2019 .   
 
ASSESSMENT FINDINGS  
A. Organizational technical capacity assessment of HPD to lead design, development, 
coordinate , and implement evidence -based SBCC campaigns showed that the endline 
organizational technical capacity assessment of performance increased from 58% in 2015 to 83.9% in 2019, an actual increase of 44.6%.   See figure  below .  9

B. There were three CADP training sessions over the period of support. Cohort CADP 1 
participants assessed themselves highest as very high performing  at endline (30%), followed 
by cohort 3 CADP participants (17.4%) and then cohort 2 CADP participants (11.1%). The observed differences were statistically significant (Fishers’ exact test of independence, p<0.001)  [Table i] .

C. There were two training sessions for TOHPs: SfC cohort 1 and SfC combined cohorts 2 and 3. 
In cohort 1 , 33.3%  assessed themselves in 2019 as very high performing  in application of 
knowledge and  skills acquired from the trainings , compared with 0% in 2016 before training. 
In SfC cohorts 2 and 3 , 26.3% of  participants combined assessed themselves in 2019 as very 
high performing  in application of knowledge and skills acquired from the trainings compared 
with 6.7% in 2017 before training [Table ii] .

Fifteen CADP and SfC participants have so far received initial funding for various SBCC projects at the local level. The evidence so far shows that they are able to negotiate with stakeholders, and their working relations with colleagues have improved enabling them to mobilize  community and others to support their planned SBCC projects.  
 
Co-location : USAID Communicate for Health project team co- located with the HPD at 
national level  to facilitate the application of an effective and efficient form of institutional 
and individual capacity building to ensure local ownership and sustainability. USAID Communicate for Health staff supported, coached, and problem -solved with their HPD  
counterparts, enabling them to take the lead in planning, implementing, and monitoring SBCC project activities.  
 
D. Internship: To complement the CADP and SfC training program s, the CBSP included 
promotion of an  internship program  where officers were embedded into private sector 
institutions (Mullen Lowe, VIAMO, and Creative Storm Networks) for hands -on practical 
training in various aspects of SBCC programs.  
 The internship at Mullen Lowe has enhanced the technical capacity of the material s development 
unit of HPD and  has contributed greatly to the attraction of SBCC contracts from various partners 
and their successful execution.   The internship with V IAMO  provided opportunities for two  HPD staff to develop knowledge and skills 
in how to plan, design, and deploy SBCC campaigns using cutting edge SMS mobile technology, including those used for the project’s mobile phone cohort survey .  11 
  
Three staff from  the HPD  and another from the F amily Health Division (F HD) had a 3 -week internship 
training  in 2018 with Creative Storm Networks on social media. Currently, a Social Media Unit has 
been established and operated  by HPD officers and partly equipped at the Department to live stream 
activities of the GHS on the various social media platform as part of the structure of the new Division. So far , the Facebook page  established by the social media unit of HPD has 38,900 likes and 
39,000 followers as of June 26, 2019; Twitter and Instagram have 1302 a nd 1314 followers  
respectively . 
 
LESSONS LEARNED  
A. Focusing  only on “hard” issues of project implementation is not helpful and will result in 
conflicts and delayed implementation of activities  due to “ cultural ” shocks between different 
parties . The “softer” aspects such as attitudinal change s, commitment , and motivation are 
equally important  for capacity building .  
 
B. It is necessary to build conflict resolution mechanisms into projects, such as support from senior highly -respected officers with enough clout to intervene when things are not moving 
well.  
 
C. It is important to ensure there is synergy and complementarity of “above the line” and 
“below the line” SBCC efforts to avoid creating a gap in implementation.  
 
D. Co-location and internship approaches enhance performance and improve efficiency, as they  
provide  opportunity for transfer of knowledge and skills from one partner to another on the 
job rather than in a classroom setting.  
 
CHALLENGES AND GAPS  
 
CADP and SfC : Despite the carefully planned and executed CADP and SfC training plans, the 
participants scored themselves low in certain areas such as knowledge and skills acquired in 
mobile technology, e ffective SBCC through TV documentary, understanding social marketing 
and understanding f ormative assessment in SBCC.  
 
A. There is a need to revisit the training syllabus and change either the content, facilitators , or 
mode of delivering these topics to include more practical sessions. Currently, the training program  is dependent on donor support from USAID Communicate for Health and is not 
sustainable if not internalized.  
 
B. Specific to CCF, owing to delays in release of funds due to circumstances beyond the project’s control, only one round of CCF awards had been made as of  time of assessment in 
June 2019, although the plan was to make three awards during the entire pr oject lifespan. A ll 
three tranches of funds were released to the CCF by the end of the project.  
 12 
 Co-location : There appears to have been an initial “cultural shock” due to different work 
ethic (public vs. private mentality). This affected the transfer of knowledge and skills from 
USAID Communicate for Health officers to their counterparts at the beginning of the project .  
 
Internship : One weakness of the internship program  for HPD was the limited number of 
officers who benefitted from it: two  at VIAMO, three  at Mullen Lowe and three  at Creative 
Storm Networks. The problem is that the capacity built depends on a few officers who may 
be overburdened as work load increases.  
 
RECOMMENDATIONS  
Based on the interviews, findings, observations , and analysis of all that has happened to HPD from 
2015 to 2019, the following recommendations are made to enhance future capacity building 
initiatives of the new Health Promotion (HP)  Division moving forward.  
 
A. Prior to training, conduct a training needs assessment among the officers of HP Division 
based on the defined responsibilities and expected roles of key officers of the new HP Division, as well as on the job descriptions of Health Promotion practitioners.  
 
B. Continue and institutionalize  the capacity building effort through CADP and SfC and other 
technical courses to further build capacity of HP officers, while considering weaknesses and 
suggestions provided by participants. Specifically, there must be greater focus on improving 
quality of delivery of topics and practical skill acquisition during the training (including use of 
simulation exercises), and less on theoretical concepts that have not proven that useful for 
the participants.  
 
C. Explore other ways of providing technical capacity support to HPOs and TOHP to 
complement current CADP and SfC approaches, such as online courses , access to e -books, 
and use of digital applications such as S kype and Zoom for workshops to minimize training 
cost and enhance efficiency .  
 
D. Advocate for t he formalization of modified CADP and SfC by  the professional Allied Council as 
a Continuous Professional Development (CPD) course for HP officers. This will serve as an incentive for HP officers to participate in such courses.  
 
E. Support the incorporation of CADP and SfC into the curriculum of the Kintampo College of Health and Wellbeing and other HP training institutions to improve capacity of trainees at pre-service level.  
 
F. Institutionalize  the internship capacity building system (two -weeks or so) with creative firms 
or local or international organizations doing media, social marketing, social media or SBCC work, for key technical staff.  
 
G. In addition to SBCC, other areas where capacity building is required and proposed include training in leadership and management, advocacy and networking, strategic planning, 13 
 resource mobilization, policy development, health promotion practice, knowledge transfer , 
and research.  
 
H. Establish annual best HPO and TOHP awards as envisaged in current National HP Strategy to 
boost morale and encourage competition.  
 
I. Initiate an annual HP conference during which beneficiaries of CADP, SfC, CCF and other capacity building initiatives can be invited to showcase what they are doing currently in their 
respective areas after training. Partners can be invited and encouraged to sponsor aspects of 
the program  and to make presentations.

 INTRODUCTION  
 
BACKGROUND  
 
The Health sector in Ghana consists of both  public and private  health systems  distributed across 1 0 
regions: Ashanti, Brong Ahafo, Central, Eastern, Greater Accra, Northern, Upper East, Upper West, 
Volta and Western Regions . In 2019, the regions were  further subdivided into 16 regions.  The public 
sector is run by Ghana Health Service  (GHS) and teaching hospitals. The private sector is made up of 
faith -based and private -for-profit health institutions. The G HS is a three -tier health delivery system 
of primary, secondary , and tertiary leve ls. The GHS consist s of about 10 divisions, including Family 
Health Division (FHD) . 
 The primary level is the district level where a district hospital with a medical doctor serves Health Centers  in Sub -districts with Physician Assistants in charge. In some  sub-districts are Community 
Health Planning and  Services (CHPS) zones where Community Health Officers (CHOs) work with 
community volunteers to increase access to health care. A typical district with a population of 100,000 has one hospital,  five health centers  and 10 –15 CHPS zones. The leadership of the district is 
the District Director of Health Services who works with a District Health M anagement Team and 
reports administratively to the District Chief Executive (Political Head) and technically to the Regional Director of Health Service.  Komfo Anokye, Korle -Bu, Tamale , and Cape Coast are the 
current teaching hospitals providing tertiary care and training of doctors, though there are a few 
private teaching hospitals emerging that provid e the  same services . The chief executives of the 
public teaching hospitals report to the Minister of Health through a board . 
 
At the regional level is the regional hospital, which is the referral level for secondary care and is run 
by general practitioners and specialists. The Regional Director of Health Services oversees all matters 
of health in the region, works with a t eam  (Regional Health Management Team) , and reports 
administratively to the regional Minister (Political Head)  and technically to the Director General of 
the Ghana Health Service who reports to the Minister of Health through a Council  [ MOH/GHS 2013] .  
 The HPD has evolved over the years from a unit at the Ministry of Health to a Department of the GHS under Family Health Division until April 2019 when it was  elevated to the status of a Division of 
GHS. At the national and regional levels are Health Promotion officers  (now Health Educator, Health 
Promotion) , who hold a minimum of a first degree in Health Promotion ( HP) from a recognized 
university, while at the district level are T echnical Officers Health Promotion , who have a  diploma in 
Health Promotion,  trained at the Kintampo College of Health and Wellbeing.  As of June 2013, th ere 
were 70 health educators on MOH p ayroll and  33 on GHS payroll countrywide.  Only 42 out of the 
then 216 districts had Health Promotion Officers as of  2014. Currently, there are about 310 HPOs 
and TOHP in GHS distributed in all the regions and districts of Ghana. Institutions providing training 
to Health Promotion staff are  KNUST  (Masters in health education and promotion; University of 
Ghana (Bachelors/Master in P ublic Health Promotion); UCC (Masters in Health E ducation); College of 
Health Science Kintampo , now called Kintampo College of Health and Wellbeing  (Diploma in H ealth 
Promotion); Catholic University at Fiapre (Public Health E ducation)); University of Health and Allied 15 
 Sciences (Bachelor’s in Public Health (Health promotion)); and UHASS/ Leeds Met . (MSc Public 
Health (Health Promot ion) [GHS 2017a].  
  
CONTEXT  
 
The practice of Health Promotion (HP) has had a checkered  history in Ghana, struggling to be 
recognized as a technical service  over the years , even within the Ministry of Health and Ghana  
Health Service, mainly due to the prom otion of a bio- medical model of health in Ghana. The practice 
of HP has therefore often been an afterthought in the country , with over concentration on curative 
health care and service delivery to the neglect of a preventive, protective , and promotive health 
delivery model that places emphasis on the social determinants of health . Consequently, despite 
several attempts to uplift the image of HP, the discipline has been plagued with low morale due to lack of financial and other support , inadequate technical capacity to deliver, as well as weak policy 
and strategic direction , among other  issues. 
 
The first major attempt to provide guidance and policy direction for health promotion in Ghana was in 2005 when the first Health Promotion Policy w as drafted; this was  revised in 2013 due to 
emergence of a number of new issues. To further improve the environment for HP, in 2015, the process for the development of a National Strategic Plan was started  to attract development 
partners and to facilitate the translation of the HP  policy into a plan for easy implementation. T hree 
strategic objectives  including  1)
 improved quality of health promotion services, 2) i mproved healthier 
communities and 3) increased collaboration and partnerships for health promot ion were identified  
[GHS/HPD 2015 ]. A number of partners  were secured , notably UNICEF, USAID , and WHO had been 
supporting Health Promotion Department over the years , but many gaps rem ained to be filled (see 
Chapter 1  for details).  
 
It is within this context that USAID , through the Communicate for Health project, entered the scene 
in 2015 to support the Department.  after five years of capacity strengthening efforts  and with USAID 
Communicate for Health support coming to an end , it has become necessary to assess the Health 
Promotion Department . The purpose of this assessment is to determine the level of improvement in 
its technical and organizational capacity to develop, design and implement theory- informed, 
evidence- based social and behavior change communication programs, which was one of the key 
focus areas for the USAID Communicate for Health project. It is expected that the findings of the assessment will also feed into the development of a new Strategic Plan for HP from 2020 , as the 
current one ends in December 2019. 
 
 A summary of Terms of Reference (ToR) for the assessment is listed below:  
1. Has Health Promotion Department (HPD) increased its capacity from 2015 –2019 to lead 
design, development, coordinate , and implement evidence -based social and behav ior change 
campaigns?  
2. To what extent have Health Promotion Officers (HPOs)) applied the knowledge and skills acquired through participation in the CADP to develop proposals, plan , and implement 
evidence based social and behavior  change and health promotion  campaigns?  16 
 3. To what extent have Technical Offi cers for Health Promotion (TOHP ) applied the knowledge 
and skills acquired through participation in the Set for Change (SfC) Action Learning S ets 
program to develop proposals, plan and implement evidence -based  social and behavior  
change and health promotion campaigns?  
4. To what extent and in what ways has the Health Promotion Department increased its 
capacity for evidence -based social and behavior  change communication through the 
different capacity building approaches rolled out by the Communicate for Health project?  
5. Are there any unintended outcomes resulting from the implementation of the capacity 
building programs, and how have these complemented the intended outcomes?  In addition, 
are there any unintended outcomes in HPDs capacity achieved over the life of the project that can be attributed to the capacity strengthening efforts of the Communicate for Health project?  
6. What important successes and lessons can be learned through rollout of the HPD capacity building program for future programming?  
7. What challenges were encountered during rollout of the capacity building programs that could inform the design of future capacity building programs?    
 
USAID Communicate for Health Project and Capacity Building Support Plan (CBSP) for 
HPD  
 
USAID Communicate for Health is a five -year USAID funded project (2015 –2019) that has been 
working in collaboration with t he Health Promotion Department and had three key results areas . 
Expected Result #1:  Improved behavior changes in family planning, water, sanitation and hygiene 
(WASH), nutrition, maternal and child health (MCH), and malaria prevention and treatment through the development and implementation of social and behavior change communication (SBCC) strategies.  Expected Results #2 (ER#2):  
Health Promotion Department (HPD) capacity strengthened to 
effectively coordinate and deliver SBCC and health promotion campaigns. Expected Result #3:  
Capacity of one local Social and Behavior  Change Communication (SBCC) organization develope d and 
strengthened to be a potential direct recipient of USAID funding.  This review covers only ER#2 , 
which envisaged providing capacity building support among others to national, regional and district level health promotion staff , in partnership with othe r stakeholders , to enable them deliver on their 
mandate.  
 
In order to operationalize ER#2, a Capacity Building Support Plan (CBSP ) was developed in 
collaboration with the then Ghana Health Service Health Promotion Department, local Ghanaian 
partners and i nternational development partners  [USAID Communicate for Health, February 2016] . 
The Plan  sets forth the following: 
• specific activities available and the associated learning objectives  
• for whom  these activities are designed  
• how they can be ass essed  
• how they will be delivered and when  
 The CBSP and the curriculum for training were informed by a number of assessments including:  17 
 • A summary of bottleneck analysis undertaken by HPD in 2014  
• A rapid organizational/institutional assessment of the GHS Health Promotion Department 
SBCC  knowledge and skills  conducted in April/May 2015 among HQ -based Health Promotion 
staff, as well as some staff from Northern, Volta and Western regions   
• Individual assessments of all national staff and staff from the five focus regions   
• A review of the draft job descriptions for HP officers   
• A one -day workshop and group discussion with eight  TOHPs from a selection of regions to 
discuss and explore capacity needs and job challenges.  
 
Core Elements of CBS P 
The CBS P was designed to be  an integrated, mutually re -enforcing technical capacity building plan 
with core elements en visaged initially to include  the following , which is taken and edited from  the 
well-articulated CBSP document. A summary of the plan is provided below ( see Appendix  2 for 
details)  [USAID Communicate for Health, February 2016] : 
 
Change Agent Development Program : The Change Agent Development Program (CADP) is a 
one-week program designed to strengthen the individual technical capacity of select 
national, regional and district -level staff through technical presentations followed by 
questions and discussion, use of case studies, and practical group exercises. Participan ts are 
selected after a rigorous clearly defined selection criteria jointly designed by HPD and USAID 
Communicate for Health personnel.  
 
Set for Change: The Set for Change (SfC) Action Learning Sets , as elaborated in the CB SP, is a 
learning set for Technical Officers Health P romotion ( TOHP ) participants that convenes for 
1.5 days four times over a six -month period ; it cover s personal development and 
effectiveness, technical skills in problem solving , and development of HP practice in their 
new role.  The Set for Change is a hybrid approach that combines an  action learning set 
model with taught technical inputs  and practical hands -on group work to promote critical 
thinking and problem solving, increase technical knowledge and skills , as well as build 
confidence, create a greater sense of self, and improve personal effectiveness. In addition to 
the action learnin g component of the SfC , there are taught sessions delivered by experts on a 
range of topics such as Monitoring and  Evaluation ( M&E ), community mobilization, program 
management, and us e of mobile technology for SBCC  [USAID Communicate for H ealth,  
February 2 016] . 
 
Gender integration trainings : Gender integration training is designed to improve technical 
competencies in creating gender sensitive programming and activities for national and some regional staff.  The training is expected to help participants understand how cultural 
practices, traditional beliefs, social, and gender norms can affect our behavior and our 
motivation to change . 
 
Stretch assignments : The CBS P also was designed to include stretch assignments for regional 
and district level staff to work at  the national or regional level on a specific task or activity 
such as developing a campaign or the M&E framework.  18 
  
1. Internship program s. These program s were designed  for HP officers to work with USAID 
Communicate for Health ’s core partners (Ghana Community  Radio Network, V IAMO 
[formerly VOTO Mobile] , Creative Storm Networks ) and contractors, Mullen Lowe,  to learn 
elements of SBCC skills on the job.  
 
2. Peer Mentoring : Selected past participants of CAD P and SfC are expected to offer support 
and mentoring to their colleagues who have yet to have attended a development program.  
 
Change Challenge Fund: This is a competitive , performance -based grant to allow recently 
trained change agents to conceive , devel op, and implement small- scale SBCC 
activities/campaigns at the district or regional level that are aligned with the overarching GoodLife  strategy. The Change Challenge Fund (CCF) has been set up to ensure CAD P and SfC 
participants have the opportunity to use and apply their new knowledge and skills in their daily work and are not constrained by lack of resources. The fund is managed through a Fixed Amount Award  (FAA) by a management board.  
 
6. Post -training motivational support  through mobile phone messages, prompts to act and 
reminders on behaviors and practices, refresher tips, quizzes , and games to consolidate 
learning and reinforce the adoption of particular sk ills or actions on the job was provided to 
all CAD P and SfC graduates.  
 
7. Co-location:  This was conceived within the context of Action Learning where the “Learning by 
Doing Model” w as operationalized [USAID Communicate for Health Project Proposal 2014] . 
The Plan was for the USAID Communicate for Health  team to co -locate with the HPD at 
national level to facilitate the application of an effective and efficient form of institutional and individual capacity building to ensure local ownership and sustainability. USAID 
Communicate for Health  and its partners were expected to work side -by-side with  HPD staff 
as a blended team to conceive and implement a comprehensive SBCC and health promotion 
campaign under the Ex pected Result #2 of the project.  
 
Methodology  
 A mixed method  methodology, combining qualitative and qu antitative approaches , was adopted  for 
the assessment based on the ToR, with triangulation of findings for validation and to generate evidence to answer key assessment  questions. There was an initial meeting with USAID 
Communicate for Health project staff to clarify T oR and the S cope of Work .  
 An inception meeting with the consultant and staff of HPD and USAID Communicate for Health was 
held on April 17, 2019 to: 
• Understand the ToR  
• Agree on the methodology for carrying out the assessment 
• Agree on timelines  
• Understand draft i nterview guides  19 
 • Book appointment s 
• Finalize  administrative arrangements for interviews and field visits  
 
This was followed by desk review of a number of documents to understand and obtain information 
on the inputs, processes, outputs , and outcomes of HP interventions in support of the HPD by 
various partners, as available, and to obtain baseline and trend of HP indicators. Some of the key documents that were  reviewed include:  
 
• USAID Communicate for Health, CBSP technical proposal and its Annual Monitoring and  
Evaluation Plan (AMEP), [USAID Communicate for Health, 201 4]  
• The primary design documents of the Change Agent Development Program, “ Set for Change ” 
Action Learning Sets, Change Challenge Fund  [see Appendix  2] 
• USAID Communicate for Health, 2015. Baseline capacity assessment reports of HPD at 
national and in the three regions (Western, Northern and Volta),  August 2015 . [USAID 
Communicate for Health August 2015]  
• USAID Communicate for Health, 2016. Outcome assessment reports of CADP cohorts 1 
[USAID Communicate for Health 2016]  
• Pre- and post- training evaluation reports during CADP and SfC training [ USAID Communicate 
for Health Annual Report 2016 ] 
• USAID Communicate for Health annual progress reports, [USAID Communicate for Health, 
2015 -9] 
• USAID and GHS Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for the implementation of USAID 
Communicate for Health in 2015  [USAID Communicate for Health, 2018  
• Situation Analysis and bottleneck analysis of HPD in 2014  [GHS 2014 ] 
• HP Strategic Plan 2015 -2019 [GHS 2015 ] 
• Job descriptions for HP Program Managers and Technical Officers  [GHS 2019 ]  
• HPD Annual Reports, 2015 -2018  
 A literature  review was  also undertaken to understand current thinking about capacity building to 
inform the framework to be adopted. A number of interview guides were developed for individual 
and institutional assessment, and an  orientation  session was organized for interviewers  to familiarize 
themselves with the tools . 
 
Endline Technical and Organizational  Capacity Assessment  
The SBCC CAT tool  [C-Change March 2011 ] that was used for baseline capacity assessment in 2015 
was used again on May 2, 2019, for HPD officers to self -assess organizational capacity 
improvements, if any, at the national level , using mostly HPD staff who participated in the initial 
baseline assessment, depending on their availability. The SBCC CAT tool has five component SBCC 
areas [Understanding the Context through Situation Analysis;  Focusing and Designing the 
Communication Strategy;  Creating Inter ventions and Materials for Change;  Implement ing and 
Monitoring Change Process;  and Evaluation and  Re-planning for Outcome and Sustainability]. Each 
component area has sub -component questions which explore further different aspects of the 
component area .  20 
  
The participants were  brought together in a room and the  tool projected on a screen so that all 
could  see the questions and respond accordingly. The consultant went through each question to 
ensure  clear understanding of each  question and the  scale for assessment. The participants were  
allowed to discuss each of the questions and come to a consensus followed by self -scoring of their 
own performance  on a scale of 1 –4 with defined scorecard scores  (1= poor; 4 = best). The reason for 
each scoring  was elicited and recorded , in addition to the consensus value itself .  
 
Key informant  and in-depth interviews were  also undertaken to obtain additional information and 
opinions of interviewees on what they think about HPD in terms of their competence and ability to deliver on key technical SBCC elements . Qualitative approaches including key informant intervie ws 
and in-depth interviews were  used for Health Promotion Officers and Technical Officers of Health 
Promotion.  Regional Directors and District Directors from four of the five USAID focus regions (Volta, 
Central, Western and Greater Accra regions ; Northern was not included because of distance) were 
visited for in -depth interviews to gain additional understand of HP  situation in these regions  
[see 
Appendix  1 for list of people intervie wed]. Similar interviews were conducted with partners who have 
supporte d HPD since the initial assessment in 2015 such as UNICEF, WHO, and PATH. Key USAID 
Communicate for Health  officer s and partners such as Mullen Lowe, Creative Storm  Networks , and 
VIAMO, where HPD interns were deployed, were also interviewed using relevant interview guides 
tailored to the organization .  
 
Endline Technical Training Outcome  Assessment  
An endline Technical Training Outcome  Assessment was also done in 2019 (2 –4 years after the CADP 
and SfC training s) based on methodology described below using a n outcome  assessment tool (see 
appendix 3 ) for participants of CADP, SfC and CCF from the regions and distr icts. This wa s to 
determine any individual capacity building improvements and how participants have applied their 
new knowledge and skills since attending the various capacity b uilding  trainings . Participants were 
asked to assess the relevance of the train ing to their job description, application of knowledge and 
skills acquired after their training, as well as what has been done differently as a result of their 
participation in the training.  
 
Sampling methodology: (Inclusion and exclusion criteria)  
All participants (from region s and districts) who ha d participated in CADP, SfC or CCF (and their 
superv isors from all the regions ) were contacted for the technical training assessment using a 
Google version of the technical outcome  assessment tool. This approach  was selected as it gave  the 
opport unity to reach most of the participants through a simple tool, in order to obtain enough 
information for comparative analysis of different cohorts.  
 
Definitions and Framework for Assessment  
 The framework for the assessment is based on that provided by Lammert et al. 2015, which  defines 
capacity building as “interventions that strengthen an organization’s  or individual’s ability to fulfil its 
mission by promoting sound management, strong governance and persistent r ededication to 21 
 achieving results.” [Lammert et al. 2015] . It goes on to state that capacity building depends on having 
adequate numbers of staff with requisite knowledge and skills, adequate technical and managerial 
systems, suitable physical infrastructure, and ample financial and other resources. In the context of HPD, the mission is 
to provide a sustained health promotion service that will contribute to improving 
health and wellbeing, in line with the health sector goal of ensuring a healthy and productive 
population. This will be achieved through promotion of early preventative strategies, promotion of healthy behaviours  and wellbeing, and creation of environments where individuals, families and 
communities are informed  and empowered , and able to live healthier , happier lives 
[GHS 2015].  
 
Capacity building is a process , rather than a final output, and it requires deliberate and planned 
change to produce goods and services to an acceptable standard. Capacity represents the potential for using resources effectively and maintaining gains with gradually reduced levels of external support 
[La Font et al 2003 ]. To be effective, capacity building requires long term multi -level 
approaches at fo ur levels: systems, organization, health personnel, and community. Focus of this 
assessment principally covered the organizational and health personnel levels and, as appropriate, at the systems level. The technical capacity at the health personnel level was assessed as ability to apply knowledge, skills , and experience in management, training, service delivery , and other related 
activities 
[La Font et al 2003] . However, it is recognized that performance to deliver does not depend 
only on technical capacity but also on a favorable  enabling environment in terms of supportive 
policies, adequate infrastructure, financial access , and requisite numbers of properly motivated 
staff.  
 
According to Morgan, motivation, commitment , and behavior are important in evalua tion as well as 
changes in resources availability, skills, and management structure [Morgan 1997] . It also includes 
ability to form productive relationships with groups outside itself and sell itself through rebranding. Hence these enabling factors were al so assessed in addition to the technical capacity. It is also 
recognized that demonstrating causality and attribution is very difficult as it is non -lineal, hence 
analysis of contextual factors was done, as indicated, for plausible association rather than causality 
[James 2001] . 
 Table 1 provides definition of various capacity and performance variables used as part of the assessment.  
 
Table 1. Capacity and Performance Variables Defined  
 
Input  Set of resources, including health person nel, financial resources, space, policy orientation, 
and program service recipients, that are the raw materials that contribute to capacity at each 
level (system, organization, health personnel, and individual/community)  
Process  Set of activities, practices, or functions by which the resources are used in pursuit of the 
expected results  
Output  Set of products anticipated through the execution of practices, activities, or functions  
Outcome  Set of results that represent capacity (an ability to carry  out stated objectives), often 
expected to change as a direct result of capacity -building intervention  
 
Performance  Set of results that represent productivity and competence related to an established objective, 
goal or standard. The four capacity levels together contribute to overall system -level 
performance.  22 
  
Impact  Long -term results achieved through improved performance of the health system: sustainable 
health system and improved health status. Impact measures are not addressed in capacity -
building M&E .

STRUCTURE OF REPORT  
Based on the capacity bu ilding framework described in above, triangulation of data from desk 
review, key informant interview s, and assessment reports was  done  to derive information to answer 
the ToRs.  The report is structured in two volumes: the main report in Volume one focuses on 
assessing the technical improvements in HPD due to USAID Communicate for Health capacity 
building support as per the CBSP, while Volume two assesses the unintended outcomes of the capacity building support to HPD (ToR 5) during the period.  
 
A summary of baseline situation of  HPD is described in Chapter 1  to provide information on 
contextual situation of the Department at the beginning of 2015 , to put in perspective any changes 
that would be observed at the end of the USAID Communicate for Health project.  Chapter 2  answers  
the question of whether there have  been any technical improvements at organizational and 
individual levels in HPD as of  2019. This was assessed by comparing the self- assessment  at baseline  
with that of  2019 (endline), using the same organizational and individual technical assessment tools 
described above. The evidence for their self- assessment is then provided. Since a large aspect of the  
CBSP consisted of CADP and SfC trainings, special analysis was done for each of them to find out 
whether there have  been any technical improvements at the individual level immediately after 
training , and two to four  years after the training. Pre - and post -technical  training outcome 
assessments’ results for CADP participants were compared for performance changes, with Fisher’s 
exact test of independence (significance at P< 0.05) used to determine significance of any changes observed before and after trainin g. The story behind the figures were explored to provide insight 
into the reasons for any  performance changes , or lack thereof . 
 23 
 Chapter 3 looks at some of the other capacity building initiatives of the project as envisaged in the 
CSBP . Only positive achievements are highlighted in this chapter ; challenges/weaknesses and gaps 
are di scussed in Chapter 4 .    
  
Chapter 4  and summariz es discusses conclusions of the achievements and weaknesses , challenges , 
and gaps  per ToRs , in capacity building effort . Finally,  Chapter 5  makes recommendations for 
sustaining the gains in technica l capacity built for HPD  going forward .  
 A first draft of the assessment report was compiled and circulated followed by a stakeholders’ meeting to discuss the report on June 20, 2019 for their inputs . A second draft report was  then 
developed and circulated on July 9, 2019 for final inputs by stakeholders before two volumes of the  
Endline Assessment Report were  prepared and submitted .

 CHAPTER ONE : BASELINE SITUATION ANALYSIS  OF HPD CAPACITY . 
 
This chapter provides information on the baseline capacity situation of Health Promotion  
Department, especially in relation to SBCC initiatives,  as of  January 2015.  
 
1.1 BOTTLENECK ANALYSIS  
 
A bottleneck analysis was conducted in 2014 to provide information t o feed into the development of 
the HP Strategy. A summary of findings is presented below [GHS 2014] . 
 1. There were  no staffing norms and job d escription s for health promotion staff in GHS.  
Almost all professional health officers of GHS had staffing norms and job description s developed 
by Human Resource Division of GHS and Ministry of Health ( MOH ) to guide staff career 
development, job placement, promotion , and salary structure. Unfortunately, as of January 
2015, there were no such documents for HP officers. This gap was a very demotivating factor for 
HP officers and a deterrent for other health professionals considering the  discipline as a 
profe ssion. Not surprising, as of  June 2013 , there were only about 33 Health Educators  on GHS 
payroll.  
 
2. There was no in -service trai ning plan for health promotion o fficers.  
Even though a number of training sessions were organized by various partners in  which  HP 
officers participated, these training sessions were ad hoc and not tailored to the needs of HP in 
contemporary times. There was therefore no systematic in -service training plan specifically to 
build technical capacity of HP officers after their graduation as of January 2015.  
 
3. The capacity of health promotion staff was inadequate to deliver on their mandate .  
Not surprising, with the exception of a few HP professionals, the existing HP officers lacked the technical capacity to deliver quality SBCC campaigns then.  
 
4. There was uncoordinated production of health promotion materials and messages . As of 2015, 
SBCC materials were being produced by various partners , usually without recourse to HPD and 
there was no systematic process and structure in place to review the SBCC materials be fore 
production .  
 
5. Monitoring and supervision of health promotion activities at all levels was irr egular and ad hoc. 
The problem was compounded by the lack of national HP indicators in the then District Health 
Information Management System 2 ( DHIMS2 ). 
 
1.2 TECHNICAL AND ORGANI ZATIONAL CAPACITY ASSESSMENT IN 2015  
 
Another activity that provided useful information at beginning of the USAI D Communicate for Health  
project for design of the capacity building support plan was an Organizational Technical Capacity 
assessment in 2015 using the SBCC -TOCAT tool [C-Change 2011; see session 2 .1]. Capacity 25 
 assessment of national HPD was completed with  18 staff, and 22 others  from  Western Volta a nd 
Northern regions in 2015 . The HPD team identified several areas of weakness in SBCC for capacity 
strengthening. These weaknesses and deficiencies informed the design of the Capacity building plan 
for HPD between 2015 and 2019 by USAID Communicate for Health.  
 
A summary of areas of SBCC that were found inadequate is provided below:  
• Knowledge and application of relevant theories and models for situation analysis and SBCC 
program design  
• Documentation and implementation of a comprehensive communication strategy  
• Design of programs for target audience segments  
• Development of SMART communication objectives for all SBCC programs  
• Use of key elements of SBCC material development, including creative briefs , and effective   
material and message design  
• Development and implementation of comprehensive documentary systems to record the use 
of the key elements of effective material and message design  
• Development and implementation of a plan for strengthening staff SBCC competenc ies 
• Structured training of management and technical staff in SBCC  
• Linking program indicators to communication objectives  
• Development and implementation of a data collection and analysis plan for all SBCC 
programs  
• Training of staff in data collection, analysis and quality assurance  
• Documentation of best practices  
• Analysis of M&E data  
• Development and implementation of mechanisms to record the use of M&E data to assess 
and improve programs  
• Development and implementation of a comprehensive system of data archival and 
management  [USAID Communicate for Health, 2016 ]. 
 
          
  26 
 CHAPTER TWO : TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
 
Two main tools were used to determine effectiveness of the SBCC capacity building initiatives  of the 
USAID Communicate for Health project support to HPD . Organizational outcome performance 
improve ment was measured mainly by comparing 2015 and 2019 organizational self-assessment by 
HPD officers using the SBCC -TOCAT tool (see 2 .1 below). The outcome  assessment of individual 
technical capacity was similarly done by comparing performance as assessed by individuals 
themselves before training and 2 -4 years after tr aining using another tool (see 2 .2 below ). The basic 
question addressed in this chapter is:  has there been any improvement in technical capacity of HPD 
to design and deliver SBCC campaigns? And if so, to what extent and in which areas?  
 
2.1 ENDLINE TECHNICAL AND ORGANI ZATIONAL CAPACITY ASSESSMENT OF HPD  
 A repeat technical and organizational self-assessment was undertaken in 2019 using the same SBCC -
TOCAT tool that was used for the baseline assessment in 2015. The SBCC -TOCAT tool has five  
component SBCC areas [Understanding the Context through Situation Analysis, Focusing and Designing the Communication Strategy, Creating Interventions and  Materials for Change, 
Implementing and Monitoring Change Process, and Evaluation and  Re-planning for Outcome and 
Sustainability]. Each component area has sub -component questions that explore  further different 
aspects of the component area.  
 
As described in the Methodology section, the participants from national HPD were brought together 
in a room and the tool projected on a screen so that they could all see the questions and respond accordingly. The consultant went through each question with them for clear understanding of the 
meaning of the question and the scale for assessment. The participants were then allowed to discuss each of the questions and come to a consensus followed by self -scoring of their own per formance 
on a scale of 1 -4 with defined scorecard scores (1= poor; 4 = best). The reason for each scoring was 
elicited and recorded in addition to the consensus itself. The baseline and endline assessments were compared for any technical organizational imp rovements.  
 
FINDINGS  
 Technical Capacity Organizational  SBCC Performance  
 Out of a possible total score of 112, the post organizational assessment score in 2019 was 94 ( 83.9% 
of total), showing an actual increase of 44.6% compared with pre -assessment score  in 2015 of 65  
(58% of total)  [see figure 3 ; and full details in Appendix  4].  
 27 
 The greatest  actual increase s were  in the area of Implementing and  Monitoring Change Process  
(78.3%) ; Focusing and Designing the Communication Strategy  (41.2%) ; and Understanding the 
Context through Situation Analysis (36.4%). In contrast, there was a deterioration of over 33% in the 
area of Evaluation and  Re-planning for Outcome and Sustainability. This was corroborated  during the 
other interviews due mainly to lack of analysis of HP data collected and inadequate use of the 
information to re -plan and evaluate SBCC activities , especially at national level.

2.2 EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF ORGANI ZATIONAL CAPACITY IMPROVEMENT  
 
The essence and purpose of any technical capacity building effort such as provided by USAID 
Communicate for Health to HPD is to enable it  to perform and deliver on its mandate as far as SBCC 
is concerned. The improved organizational technical capacity of HPD, especially in the area of SBCC development and implementation  as indicated above , is evidenced by the increasing number of key 
partne rs who have over the period sub -contrac ted HPD to develop and execute S BCC projects on 
their behalf. Some of the partners include JICA, GIZ, JHPIEGO, and PATH.  
 A short description of the projects are outlined below:  
28 
  
i) HPD developed audio visual mate rials for JICA for its CHPS  plus project [see link for audio- visual 
materials developed] .1 
 ii) HPD supported  USAID Communicate for Health to develop  cue cards on M alaria, Family Planning, 
and Nutrition . 
 iii) HPD , in collaboration with PLAN Ghana and other s takeholder s, reviewed existing posters and a 
leaflet on antenatal care, breastfeeding, post -natal care , family planning , and promotion of 
adolescent friendly services to reflect current issues that are gender sensitive and change behavior . 
Consumer dipstick, stakeholder meetings , and pretesting were carried out to finalize and print these 
materials .  
 iv) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)/USAID initiated a Second Year of Life (2YL) 
immunization program  in collaboration  with the Gha na Health Service,  Ghana Red Cross Society, 
UNICEF , WHO, Ghana Coalition of NGOs in Health, Mullen Lowe, Accra, and other local partners  in 
2017. The goal of the Project was to improve child survival by ensuring that services provided after 
first year of life are strengthened. The Project was piloted in three regions:  Volta, Northern , and 
Greater Accra regions. The districts selected in the selected regions included Accra Metro, Ga East, Ho Municipality, Adaklu, Tamale Metro , and Savelugu Nanton.  
 The HPD was specifically tasked to:  
• Supervise and ensure appropriate design and implementation of SBCC campaign based on promoting primarily vaccination in second year of life in three  selected regions by an 
advertising agency .  
• Monitor and evaluate the campaign to achieve desired behavioral change as part of the 
larger program to reduce vaccine preventable diseases in project regions.  
 
In all, 640 health workers were trained in the three regions. (Northern  – 120, Volta – 130, and 
Greater Accra  – 390).  A total of 12,122  children were referred for vaccinations , while a total of 9,176  
children received follow up visits after referral; 5,130  children were referred for Vitamin A . The 
project was well -executed to the satisfaction of CDC , and all p roject objectives were achieved  [GHS 
2017 b]. 
 v) HPD c ollaborated with the Ridge Hospital and other stakeholders to develop materials on cervical 
cancer  for public education.

 29 
 vi) HPD was involved in two Action Media Workshops held in Ada (G reater Accra) and Agona 
Nkwanta (Ahanta West District – Western Region) in February and March  2016.  The purpose of the 
exercise was to promote community participation in the material development process. The focus 
was on Sexual Workers and Men Who Sleep with Men. HPD assisted in the development of six jingles and 33 draft posters on how to fight against stigma and discrimination on sex workers and 
Men Who S leep with Men .  
 vii) Malaria Vaccine Initiative  
HPD chaired the Advocacy Communication and Social Mobilization (ACSM) , which  is responsible for 
coordinating and ensuring the successful implementation and management of all communication 
activities related to the new malaria vaccine  in four regions in Ghana: Brong Ahafo in all the 27 
districts, Central  – 20 districts, Volta – 25 d istricts, and Upper East – 4 districts.  
 In spite  of massive fake news and misinformation (with all sorts of conspiracy theories) from social 
media to prevent the public from patronizing the vaccine, almost everything has gone we ll. This was 
largely due to a counter SBCC campaign mounted by key stakeholders under the direction of HPD. 
Over 7 ,500 children received the vaccination , with only 23 refusals three weeks after onset of the 
effort.  viii) HPD provided technical support to JHPIEGO in the development of Early Childhood Development  
specific materials. These include a f lipchart, wallchart, leaflet , ToR and a manual.  
 
ix) HPD developed a  poster on Neglected Tropical Diseases ( NTDs ) for the NTD Unit of Ghana Health 
Service to be used for  its training of trainers’ sessions.  
 
Interviews with a number of the partners and review of project reports indicate very high satisfaction by the partners of the output of the work done by HPD. As one partner remarked, “ HPD 
is on top of their game . Their performance from concept development to end product h as been 
excellent.”  
 
2.3 CADP Training (Baseline Training Process Indicators, 2016)  
 As noted in the introduction  and per Appendix  2, the Change Agent Development Program (CADP) is 
a one -week  program designed to strengthen the individual technical capacity of competitively 
selected national, regional, and district- level staff through technical presentations. Topics covered 
include the following:  
 
• Developing and implementing long term SBCC strategies and emergency health communication strategies  
• Evidence -based social and behavior changes  
• Working with the TV, radio, and press media to promote social and behavior change  
• Social and cultural dimensions of behavior change and the role of gender  30 
 • The role of different channels and mediums to promoting both individual and social behavior  
change.  
• Co-ordination and management of community health communication activities  
• Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) for health promotion  
• Advocacy and influencing skills  
• Personal effectiveness and leadership skills  
• Mentorship guide to enable participants to adopt a peer mentee and impart the new 
knowledge and skills to the mentee . 
 
There were three  cohorts for the CADP training during the period. The CADP cohort 1 invol ved 26 
participants from national, regional and a few from district level. Cohort 1 training was intended as a 
pilot and lessons learned used to amend and improve cohorts 2 and 3 trainings. An additional day was added for the second and third cohort training s due to suggestions by the cohort 1 participants 
after the training. Process and timeline for the applications, including call for application and review and selection of applicants with eligibility criteria, were developed together by HPD and  USAID 
Communicate for Health.   Cohort 1 CADP  
The first CADP training was held from June 27 –July 1, 2016, at Dodowa in the Greater Accra Region; 
participation was competitive and 23 out of 26 selected HP practitioners completed the training. Pre- and imme diate post -CADP training assessment forms were administered to determine how 
successful the training has been in increasing the SBCC knowledge and competence of individual participants. The pre -training assessment questionnaire was given to all participants at the time of 
registration for completion prior to the start of the program , while the post training assessment was 
administered at the close of the training program. The post- training assessment covered  the 
relevance, delivery, and understandability of the course contents.  
 Pre- and immediate post -training results for same participants showed significant improvements in 
participants’ total scores (with a maximum possible of 30 points), ranging from 10 to 40 percent.  See below.  31 
  
Cohort 2 CADP  
The second CADP session was held from July 10 –15, 2017, at the Hephzibah Christian Health Centre, 
Peduase. The pre - and post-CADP assessment forms were similarly administered to determine how 
successful the training has been in increasing the SBCC knowledge and competence of individual 
participants. The pre -training assessment questionnaire was given to all participants at the time of 
registration for completion prior to the start of the program while the post- training assessment was 
administered at the close of the six -day program. Analysis of the completed pre - and post- training 
assessment results showed significant i mprovement in the scores for all participants with an average 
score of 13%, which gives an indication that learning had taken place as a result of the CADP as indicated in Fig. 4 
[CADP Training Report 2016] .  
 
Participants also noted that the session on M& E in SBCC (s ession 7 ) needed to be redesigned and 
simplified for comprehension , as the contents were deemed to be somewhat abstract, complex , and 
contextually above participants’  level of understanding. This expression by participants somehow 
proves that M&E was a difficult area among HPD staff, because the same concern of lack of 
understanding was expressed by the first CADP cohort.

Cohort  3 CADP  
The third  CADP training occurred from May 28 –June 2, 2018, at the HPD conference room, Korle Bu . 
The a ssessment for cohort 3 CADP participants followed a pattern similar to their cohort 1 and 2 
counterparts. Analysis of the completed pre and post training assessment results showed improvement in the scores for all participants with an average score of 12%,  which gives an 
indication that learning had taken place as a result of the CADP as indicated in Fig. 5.  19

 In addition to the pre -and post- assessment test, almost all the CADP cohorts were made to evaluate 
each session to gauge content relevance, delivery, understandability and new things learned 
immediately after the training . The participants rated the following sessions as very high in terms of 
content and delivery soon after the training:  Session 1 – Culture and its Influence on SBCC 
Session 2 – Understanding SBCC Theory  
Session 4 – Creating and Implementing Effective SBCC  
Sess ion 6 – Advocacy, Building Strategic Partnerships, Alliances , and Collaborations  
Session 7 – Understanding Social Marketing  
Session 8 – Working Effectively with the Media  
Session 9 – Effecting Social Behavior Change through TV Documentaries  
Session 10 – M obile Technology and Health Promotion  
Session 11 – Effecting Change with Community Radio  
Session 13 – Planning and Coordinating SBCC  
 Participants also noted that the following sessions needed to be redesigned and simplified for easy comprehension , as the contents were deemed to be somewhat, complex and too theoretical and 
above their level of knowledge . This challenge was reinforced by the fact that the time allocated to 
these sessions was  said to be insufficient to allow for further discussions.  
 Session 3 – Understanding Formative Assessment in SBCC  
Session 5 – Understanding Social and Community Mobilization  
Session 12 – Monitoring and Evaluation in SBCC  
Session 14 – Leadership and Personal Development [USAID Communicate for Health report 2017]  
 
2.4 ENDLI NE INDIVIDUAL TRAINING OUTCOME ASSESSMENT , 2019   
 As mentioned under Methodology section, a special interview tool [USAID Communicate for Health 2019] was developed and sent through a Google link to all participants of CADP and SfC from the 
regions and districts as part of End line assessment in 2019. As explained earlier, the key objectives of 
the End line training Outcome Assessment (TOA) were to understand:   
• outcome of the training on job performance ,  
• relevance of the training to the execution of job responsibilities ,   
• extent to which newly acquired knowledge, skills, and abilities were being applied on the job , 
and 
• enablers and barriers to the application of newly acquired knowledge, skills, and abilities .  
 The tool used was to determine any individ ual capacity building improvements, the participants 
assessment of the relevance of the training topics to their work as HPOs and TOHP after 2 –4 years in 
the field, and how participants have used the  knowledge and skills since the training . It also assesse d 
some of the enabling factors and barriers to performance after acquisition of new technical knowledge and skills during the training. The tool consists of a number of close ended coded 35 
 questions with “yes” and “no” answers for each question as applicable  (see Appendix  4). The 
information was used to answer the second  and 3rd questions as per ToR in relation to CADP and 
SfC respectively.  
 
CADP  
There were 67 CADP participants from the all the regions , as well as 27 SfC  participants. Other CADP 
participants were from the national level or from implementing partners and were excluded from the analysis. A similar tool [USAID Communicate for Health 2019] was sent to supervisors of the 
participants for their views concerning the program s and the performance of participants under 
their care. A nalysis was done  for all CADP and SfC  participants together  (response rate only) , then 
CADP cohorts 1, 2 and 3  separately , and then SfC cohort 1 as against SfC  cohorts 2 and 3 to 
determine any deviations in performance  by cohort . Fishers’ exact test of independence was applied 
as appropriate to test the statistical significance of any observed changes in scoring.  
 
Out of 94 CADP and SfC  participants from the regional and district levels, 84 resp onded , giving a 
favorable  response rate of 89.4%.  Figure 6 represents a  summary of the results of the  endline 
outcome  assessment  after the training is presented .  
 Participants self-assessed their performance by answering the question, “On a scale of 1 –5, how 
would you rate your performance after the CADP training?” according to the following scale :  0 0 0 0 0 0 15

In summary, 30% of CADP cohort 1 participants scored  themselves as  very highly performing  in 2019 , 
compared to 0% in 2016 before training [ also 70% in 2019 vs.  20% in 2015 as high performing] . 
Among  CADP cohort 2 participants , 11.1% assessed themselves as very highly performing  in 2019, 
compared with s ame figure in 2017 before training  [ also 72.2% in 2019 vs. 11.1% in 2016 as high 
performing]. Among CADP cohort 3  participants, 17.4%  assessed themselves as very high performing  
in 2019, compared with 0% in 2018 before training [ also 60.9% in 2019 vs.  17.4% in 2018 for high 
performing [ Fig 6 ). 
It can be seen from Table 2  that the difference s are statistically significant (Fishers’ exact  test of 
independence,  P< 0.001) , indicating that the differences observed before and after among the 
cohorts are not due to chance . It can also be seen that in terms of assessment as very high 
performing, cohort 1 participants assessed themselves highest (30%), followed by cohort 3 (17.4%) 
and then cohort 2 (11.1%). The conclusion is that the changes made after CADP cohort 1 training (such as adding another day to training period) did not significantly affect the on -the-job 
performance of cohorts 2 and 3 p articipants  after training.

Application of Knowledge and Skills  
Understanding how the knowledge, skills, and experience acquired during training are applied on the job is a key measure of performance (and a key objective of the CBSP).  
 To determine which  areas of the training curricula helped or did not help parti cipants in their job 
performance post - training, they were asked  to score  to what extent the training curricula 
contributed to their improved performance, as of  2019. Most of CADP participants in all cohorts 
assessed themselves low in application of knowledge and skills acquired in mobile technology (30%) , 
effective SBCC through TV documentary  (20%) , understanding social marketing (20%) , and 
understanding formative assessment in SBCC (50%) compare d with other components (Table 4). 37 
 Culture and its influence on SBCC (100%), understanding social and community mobilization (95%), 
creating and implementing effective SBCC (80%), working effectively with the media (80%), and 
planning and coordinating SBCC (80%) were scored highest.  A similar assessment immediately after 
the trainings produced slightly different results, which are discussed below .

 In terms of what they had done  differently as a result of their  participation in the CADP, sourcing 
funds for SBCC  (45%) , using mobile technology to communicate to target audience  (40%)  and 
developing indicators to monitor SBCC activities (40%) were scored low by all cohorts.

organizations (85%) and i ntegrated SBCC/HP activities into those of the DHMT  (85%) came out

participants scored themselves highest in almost all categories followe d by cohort 3  and cohort 2 
[Table 4 ].

 Set for Change  38 
 As summarized  in introductory section and elaborated in CBSP, the Set for Change (SfC) is a learning 
set for Technical Officers Health P romotion (TOHP) participants that meet for 1.5 days four times 
over a six -month period covering personal development and effectiveness, technical skills in 
problem solving , and development of HP practice in their new role s. In addition to the action 
learning component of the SfC, there are taught sessions on a range of topics such as Monitoring 
and Evaluation (M&E), community mobilization, program management, and use of mobile 
technology for SBCC. Learning from taught sessions is expected to be consolidated through practical group exercises.  [USAID Communicate for Health, February 2016].  
 SfC Cohort 1 met a total of four times: July 4 –5, 2016 at Dodowa ; November 17 –18, 2016 in Accra ; 
January 11 –12, 2017 in Ho , and February28 –March 1, 2017 at Dodowa . Unfortunately, due to 
logistic and administrative challenges SfC Cohort 2 met only once , from July 17 –19, 2018 at Peduase . 
 
  
Figure 7 Comparison of self -assessed performance by SfC cohorts 1 and 2/3, End Line 2019 
 
A similar assessment of performance was done for SfC participants  in 2019 as for CADP participants . 
There were only two cohorts for the training: cohort 1 , and cohort s 2 and 3 combined. The Action 
Learning Set Cohort 1 participants scored  themselves as very high performing  (33.3%) in 2019, 
compared with 0% in 2016 before training [ also 44.4% in 2019 vs. 0% in 2016 for high performing].  
Amo ng cohorts 2 and  3 participants, 26.7%  combined assessed themselves as very high performing  
in 2019, compared with 6.7% in 2017 [ also 60% in 2019 vs. 13.3% in 2017 as high performin g] before 
training [see Fig. 7].

 It can be seen that SfC cohort 1 trainees  assessed themselves higher (very high perform ing, 33.3%) 
compared with 26.7% for cohort 2/3 combined. The observed differences between SfC Cohort 1 and 
SfC Cohort 2/3 are statistically significant ( Fishers’ exact test of independence, p<0.001), meaning 
that the differenc es are not due to chance [Table 5 ]. Once again , it can be concluded that any 
changes made after SfC cohort 1 training did not improve the  outcome of future trainings as far as 
confidence in assessing their performance after training was concerned.  The four training sessions 
that cohort 1 benefitted from positively affected their performance , compared with SfC cohorts 2/3 
who only had one tr aining session.

 To determine specific areas of the training  that helped or did not help SfC  participants  in their post -
training performance at work, participants were asked to indicate which areas contributed to their 
improved performance, if any, just as was done for CADP participants. Sf C partic ipants assessed 
themselves low in applying their understanding of SBCC theory  (44.4%) , creating and implementing 
effective SBCC  (33.3%) , understanding social marketing  (33.3%) , using mobile technology (0%) , and 
writing winnable proposals  (44.4%) . SfC cohort 1 scored themselves very high in understanding 
social and community mobilization (10 0%) and working effectively with the media (88.9%).  Once 
again, cohort 1 appeared to have been applying knowledge and skills better than cohorts 2 and 3 
combined  in almost all areas . [Table  6]. It looks as if there was some “ dilution ” of the CADP and SfC  
training program s, instead of the expected enhancement, for subsequent cohort trainings.

What has been done differently?  
In terms of what they have  done differently since  training, SfC participants indicated that they did 
very little in sourcing funding for  SBCC activities, using mobile technology to communicate to target 
audience, and wri ting a proposal to solicit f unds for SBCC activities [Table 7 ].

 Enablers or Success Factors from Trainings  
Another question sough t to ascertain  what training facets enabled participants  to improve their 
perform ance . The participants from both CADP and SfC cohorts identified bo osted confidence, 
improved knowledge and skills, improved team work, and enhanced working relations with 
stakeholders as keys to their enhanced performance. It must be noted that the objectives of the 
CBSP included building confidence in oneself to deliver on the job due to enhanced knowledge and skills in key topic areas after training. The objectives of the  CBSP also include ability to form 
productive relationships with groups outside itself and sell itself through rebranding 
[USAID 
Communicate for Health February 2016] . Specific examples of how these factors enhanced their 
perfo rmance are listed under secti on 2 .5 below.  
 
All CADP 1 participants found the CADP training relevant to their job responsibilities . A total of 75% 
(N=20) claimed the training boosted their confidence, and 85% said it improved their 
skills/knowledge , while 80% said it enhanced working relations with stakeholders [Table 8 ].  
  
Table 8 Relevance of training by CADP cohort

 Improved my teamwork skills  80%  94.4  60.9  
Enhanced working relations with stakeholders  80%  56.6  65.2  
 
About 55.6% of SfC cohort 1 said training had boosted their confidence as of  2019 compared to  60% 
of SfC cohort 2/3 participants , while 77.8% of cohort 1 claimed the training has improved their 
knowledge and skills compared to  73% for SfC cohorts 2/3 [Table 9] . In general, SfC cohort 1 
participants scored themselves higher than SfC cohort 2 and 3 in terms of improved skills, teamwor k 
and enhanced relations with stakeholders , key objectives of CBSP .

Enhanced working relations with stakeholders  66.7  53.3  
 It must be noted that the scoring after the training in 2016 may differ from the scoring of same topic 
in 2019 since following the training, the participants were scoring their understanding of the topic 
and its delivery, while in 2019 they were scoring how useful the application of knowledge and skills acquired (in topic are a) had been in helping them perform  their work. For instance, after th e training  
in 2016, session 5 (Understanding Social and Community Mobilization) was scored low because they 
claimed not to understand the topic or  its delivery. However, two to four  years later , both the CADP 
and SfC participants scored the same topic 95% and 100% respectively as having been helpful  in 
application of knowledge acquired later  on the job. It goes to show that some of these topic areas 
are very relevant and important to their job but presentation s during future training must be 
enhanced and ma de more practical.  
 
2.5 EXAMPLES OF SUCCESS STORIES AND PERFORMANCE ENABLERS, 2019  
 To reinforce  how beneficiaries of CADP and SfC assessed their performance, a few examples of what 
some of them have been doing in practical terms are cited below.  
 SFC SUCCESS STORY :  Ms. Janet Wepiah Batako, of the Kintampo South District Health Dire ctorate, 
said that prior to participating in the SfC program, she had no desk and was rarely included in DHMT 
meetings. With the skills and confidence gained through the SfC, she succeeded in convincing the 
DDHS to provide her with basic furniture and tools, and she was invited to participate in DDHS meetings .    
 CADP SUCCESS STORIES: The CADP training has positioned some of the beneficiaries to source 
funding from other sources in the face of dwindling government financial support to the GHS . For 
example, Ms. Vida Ntiwaa Gyasi of the Ga South sub -metro successfully submitted and sourced 
funding from KAITEC to procure furniture for the Health Promotion unit amounting to 4, 000 Ghana 42 
 Cedis (GHS4,000.00, about $800 ). Ms. Gyasi also submitted a proposal to source two thousand, five 
hundred Ghana Cedis (GHS2,500.00, about $500 ) from Pambros Limited to support the Global Hand 
Washing Day celebration.  
 
The role of the TOHP is to coordinate implementation of evidence -based SBCC and HP campaigns at 
the district level and galvanizing support to address the social determinants of health at the DHMT, Sub District and Community levels, including resource mobilization . Prior to the CADP and SfC 
trainings, TOHP complained they were not involved in DHMT meetings and quite often were left out 
in decision making around SBCC and health campaigns (including resource mobilization) , practically 
relegating them to the periphery of coordination and  execution of SBCC campaigns. This finding 
suggests that TOHP are now being included in decision making at the DHMT level with implications 
for wider health system improvements for SBCC  indicators . A similar observation was made by the 
District Direc tor fo r Sunyani West who said that through the CADP, SfC and CCF program where Miss 
Mary Ayobi gained a grant to implement a campaign on malnutrition, she has become the fulcrum around which SBCC work operates in the district and has substantially improved team work among DHMT members in the Sunyani West District.  
 “There is now effective networking with community radios to educate people using appropriate SBCC 
messages. Now when I sit at the radio station, I talk confidently because I know how to go about the issues. I have been able to secure more air times for radio health discussions after the training.” An 
SfC participant  
 
“As a result of the training, I have been able to use my lobbying skills to acquire f ree air time on the 
two main r adio stations and some Local FM Stations to promote SBCC activities. This means a lot to 
me because before the training, almost everyone wanted us to pay for  air time given .” An SFC 
participant  
 
"Initially , proposal writing was something I do not event attempt at all because I  was deficient of the 
knowledge but now proposal writing is part of me after the training.”  A participant  
 “My working relationship with my co -workers has also improved tremendously due to my knowledge 
in personality identification, a skill acquired during  the training.” A participant  
 “My community mobilization skills ha ve been enhanced due to my ability to identify the appropriate 
structures in the communities.”  A participant  
 
These comments by CADP and SfC participants after the training give an indicati on of improved 
confidence, improved working relations with colleagues, and enhanced communication skills, which 
have improved their technical performance, due to application of knowledge and skills gained during 
the training they had received to enhance th eir performance.  
 
2.6 VALIDATION BY SUPERVISORS OF CADP AND SfC PARTICIPANTS , ENDLINE 2019  
 43 
 In order to validate the self -assessed performance by CADP and SfC participants after their training, 
their supervisors were interviewed in 2019 on how they assess the performance of their officers 
after returning from the CADP or SfC training. Out of 10 supervisors, eight responded.  
 All supervisors interviewed found the content of the CADP and SfC training program  relevant to the 
job responsibilities of the HP officers at regional or district levels. 87.5% of supervisors indicated that the trainees had applied their knowledge and skills in their day -to-day work after the training.  
 
Citing changes that they had see n about the participants or things that were being done differently, 
the following examples were given:  
 
“It has built  his confidence and his capacity to write many proposal s and mentor other health staff on 
health promotion activities.”  “Capable of analy zing data from DHI MS2 . He is able to draw maps, graphs and charts to improve 
behavior  change in individuals and communities.” 
 “Capable of planning and implementing health promotion activities in their various districts with little 
or no assistance. They are more enthusiastic to do more to improve the health of the people. ” 
 “During campaigns activities, his engagement with the media has improved. He was able to build 
about ten community health staff capacity on radio discussion. ”  
 “Advocated for the intro duction of tippy taps in homes to prevent diarrhea diseases and healthy 
communities’  program ; solicited for support from an NGO to buy some equipment for the office. 
Developed some SBCC material with the support from a JICA Volunteer. Able to lobby for fre e airtime 
from radio stations in the district . Collaborated more with partners (such as environmental, NGOs, 
GES etc.) and the media. ” 
 “He is more organized now and shows systematic and evidence -based approach to health promotion 
activities. ” 
 In summary,  the re sponses from the supervisors affirm their positive assessment overall of 
enhanced performance of CADP and SfC participants after the training. Not surprisingly, 86.7% of the supervisors indicated  that they would recommend the CADP and SfC training to other HP officers 
who had not yet benefi ted from them , in view of what they had witnessed in those who had 
completed t he training.

 CHAPTER THREE : INPUTS , PROCESSES  AND OUTPUTS   
 
This chapter discusses some  inputs, processes , and outputs  (apart from CADP and SfC), as relevant 
to USAID Communicate for Health ’ ER#2, that have contributed to any changes in technical 
performance identified in C hapter 2  and elsewhere. The focus is on positive achievements that 
enhanced technical performance. Discussions on c onclusions of weaknesses  and challenges are 
presented in Chapte r 4, while C hapter 5 provides the final recommendations for the new HP Division 
to maintain and enhance performance .  
 
3.1 CHANGE CHALLENGE FUND  
 The CCF is a competitive performance -based grant that allows  recently trained change agents to 
conceptualize , develop, and implement small- scale SBCC activities/campaigns at the district or 
regional level that are aligned with the overarching Good Life strategy. The Change Challenge Fund (CCF), up to GHC 6,000, has been set up to ensure CAD and SfC participants have the opportunity to use and apply their new knowledge and skills in their daily work and are not constrained by lack of resources. This fund is not to be used to cover salaries or routine activities that are the mandatory responsibility of a district but rather to fund specific activities that meet clearly designed eligibility criteria.  
 In October 2016, HPD and Communicate for Health completed the design and policy framework for 
managing and initiating the C CF. The mechanism for implementing the CCF was through an FAA with 
FHD/HPD. It was supposed to have been launched in 2017 and at least 75% of Set for Change (SfC) 
participants from the USAID five -supported regions were to be targeted. A management board was 
constituted in 2017. However, USAID gave approval of the FAA in April -June of 2018 for roll out, and 
the Competition for the CCF grants was opened in June 2018 to all 94 graduates from regions and districts from the CADP (67) and SfC (27) sessions. The CCF management board approved it on September 25, 2018 and 15 of the applicants’ proposals (see Table  10) were approved based on 
defined criteria. The successful applicants were expected to receive their first disbursements by October 2018.

Assessment of CCF Performance So Far  
 
It is too early to talk about outcome  performance thus far as the funding has delayed and only 
process and output indicators can be described. However, a number of impressive achievements 
have been chalked  up by beneficiaries and they have rolled out many activities (see photo gallery2). 
 a) The first tranche of the fund that had been released at time of the endline assessment was 
received mostly in February  2019 due to administrative and other issues. All the 15 beneficiaries 
rece ived an initial amount of GHC  2,400, (about $480) for planned activities.  
 b) Participants had carried out all 48 activities planned for the first tranche period  at time of the 
assessment. These activities were verified from reports and what was planned in the original proposals. A multisector approach was adopted by all applicants for implementation of their activities, ranging from GHS, district assemblies, community leaders, NGOs and other public sectors.  
 
c.) A sample of comments and success stories mentioned by some beneficiaries [CCF monitoring vi sit 
reports, endline 2019 ] during the interviews is provided below. Some of these  were shared during 
the second  MNCH conference in July 2019 and were well received by participants.  
 
SUCCESS STORIES  
Beneficiary No. 4, Augustine Fobi  
Augustine Fobi from Twifo Hemang Upper Denkyira in CR developed an SBCC project to reduce teenage pregnancy and anemia while improving the nutritional status of adolescent girls in the 
district with funding from CCF. Approaches adopted included:  
• B ring young adolescent girls tog ether and empower them to make healthy nutrition and 
reproductive health decisions for themselves  
• I dentify women who have achieved higher education and success in the district to educate 
and mentor them  
• G ive adolescent girls a voice to be able to freely express themselves and also contribute to 
solving their own problems  
• Undertake activities such as nutrition and reproductive health education folic acid supplementation and quarterly meetings  
 Observation s by beneficiaries : 
“Gifty Akpatso is my name, I am sixteen years of age and schooling at Hemang Assemblies of God 
International School. I have a baby; luckily I had people who encouraged me to go back to school 
after birth. The Adolescent Health and Nutrition Girls Squad is an exciting group that has helped me to get back my confidence.”

 “I was educated on teenage pregnancy during meetings. I always come to the meetings to learn 
more about the menstrual hygiene and its management from the facilitators. I thank the team for 
their love and also our supporters for bringing such a wonderful program  to my district. This program  
has really changed my life entirely.”  
 Beneficiary 15. Evans Whajah Municipal Health Promotion Officer, Tarkwa Nsuaem (Western region. 
Project: To reduce maternal death cases among women in the Tarkwa Nsuaem municipality through advocacy for improved antenatal attendance thr ough Community sensitization and awareness 
creation on maternal deaths.  Approaches:  identification and training of local information and radio operators . (community 
champions/advocates); Production and airing of jingles on maternal health; o rganization of durbars 
(Community Engagement) and r adio discussion.  
 Observation by beneficiary  
“I am Abdulai Sayibu 45  yrs of age who live at Badukrom in the Tarkwa Municipality. I did not know 
that maternal deaths were so high in the municipality and also thought that women who are able to deliver at home without going to the hospital are strong and respected but learnt after today’s  training that delivery at home could cause maternal deaths. I have therefore decided that none of my family members will deliver at hom e anymore. I will advise all other pregnant women in my 
community to regularly attend ANC and also deliver in the health facility.”  
 Beneficiary 11 John Vianney, Wa.  
Project was to promote behavior  change among men to support their partners during pregnan cy 
and child care.  
Approaches included m en wearing a 10 kg pregnancy jacket while they performed some tasks such 
as sweeping, carrying water, bathing a baby, etc. Men who wore the pregnancy jacket were made to share their experiences with the audience.  
 A man said “I never knew what women do feel when it comes to pregnancy until I wore the 
pregnancy jacket. Now I have made an informed decision to support my wife during pregnancy and child care.”  
 Other comments and lessons learned and shared by other beneficiaries include:  
 “One very powerful success story is that one girl who is 14 years who delivered [a baby] and she had stopped school for almost a year or two was able to return to school as part of a CCF funded 
advocacy project. Another success story is that one girl who is 13 years of age who got miscarriage 
and stopped school is now in school through the same advocacy project funded through CCF in district .” 
    48 
 “Success Stories: Wisdom Academy School is one of the basic schools located in the Main Ashaiman 
market , a suburb of Blakpatsona Sub municipal ity. T he school had no hand washing facilities, dust  
bins, or a health club. Rubbish was put in sacks and placed in front of the school which disfigures  the 
school. After discussions and deliberations with teachers and the pupils, they saw the need to have dust  bins, hand washing facilities, and a health club in the school. Currently, all the interventions have 
been implemented by the school authority. Here, there has been a change in the behavior of the school where most of the activities now are being coordinated by the head teacher and the school’s club has established a health club (having an executive and a president and a vice; secretary and 
deputy and organize r and sanitation officer). Again, a hand washing facility was handed over to the 
school after the various interventions put in place together with the Heal th Promotion Officer and her 
team.”  
 
“Good community entry is success  to programs in the communities.”  
 “I have learned that although there was delayed of funds, it was a good practice to start with those 
activities I could do (of which I think is a good practice) because if I had waited before commencement of the activities I would not have gotten something to write about at the end of the first quarter.”  
 All the above comments came from beneficiaries of CCF who were describing various activities, lesso ns learned , and a few results after initiating activities funded through CCF. As already noted, it 
is too early to be definitive about outcome of these activities , but early results look impressive and 
there is palpable enthusiasm among CCF beneficiaries t hat at least they have a little support to 
embark on simple self -designed projects at district and community levels.  
 
3.2 CO-LOCATION  
 A key strategy of the USAID Communicate for Health CBS P was to provide technical onsite training, 
as well as improve management and leadership practices  by ensuring staff of the project co -locate 
with HPD staff at Korle B u in the Health Promotion building. Co- location did not occur in 2015  as 
planned due to the exten sive nature of some  unanticipated renovations and repairs to the HPD 
building at Korle -Bu. However, a fter the initial delay, the Project successfully established a system 
that allowed pairs of USAID Communicate for Health  and HPD staff to work together on specific 
tasks  from the renovated HPD office  from March  2017. Staff we re paired and worked  together 
collaboratively to provide deliverables in technical areas including  monitoring and evaluation, 
capacity building, mass media, SBCC collaboration and partnerships , and a senior project 
management team. Co-location was a US AID requirement for the project.  
 Technical Capacity Building through Co -location  
The co -location strategy enabled officers of HPD and USAID Communicate for Health  to work closely 
together  and plan and transfer skills to HPD. It led to i mproved  interaction , thereby enhancing 
workflow , as well as improved bonding and enhanced chemistry among officers that facilitated 
transfer of knowledge and skills from USAID Communicate for Health to HPD officers  after working 
together for some time . Proximity and easy access to team members  to discuss technical and 49 
 program issues in real time and resolve challenges  also enhanced  the technical capacity building of 
HPD officers .  
 
As part of co -location, monthly joint planning meetings were held between HPD and s taff of USAID 
Communicate for Health at the onset when a lot of activities were being rolled out; these were later held quarterly when implementation gradually eased . Chairmanship of these meetings rotated from 
HPD to USAID Communicate for Health, and mutu al learning occurred. Especially from HPD 
perspective , it offered opportunity to learn some private sector work ethic in terms of meeting 
deadlines, writing meeting minutes and developing deliverables. Prompt feedback mechanisms were 
established for joint program operations , which allowed for understanding of the different systems 
of financial and operational systems between FHI 360 and USAID on one hand,  and Government and 
GHS on the other .  These meetings became a driving force for collaboration, decision  making, and 
team building. Over time , they became increasingly productive, highly professional, and results -
driven —with HPD often taking on a lead role for coordination. HPD staff have also become more 
involved in implementing key decisions arising from t he joint meetings, along with their “paired” 
technical counterparts from Communicate for Health, according to USAID Communicate for Health officials . Specifically, HPD used such meetings to follow up with progress with implementation of its 
own Strategic Plan, as well as use opportunities afforded to undertake regional and district monitoring of its own activities, something which rarely happened due to funding challenges before 
the USAID Communicate for Health project.  
 Communicate for Health organized annual work plans with HPD and key implementing partners 
before end of each year to develop Program  of Actions  for ensuing year s. The exercise provided 
additional opportunity for building capacity of HPD staff especially in  terms of rigorous requirements 
of USAID and other private partners in developing annual plans of work. T here was a conscious  
effort to harmonize  the activities planned for in the HPD Strategic Plan 2015 –2019 and the USAID 
Communicate for Health  project activities for each year . 
 
3.3 CAPACITY BUILDING IN FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT  
 
The two main funding channels used by USAID Communicate for Health are the Fixed Amount Award 
(FAA) and the In -Kind Grant (IKG) mechanism. IKG is used by USAID Communicate for Health for 
procurement of goods and services on behalf of HPD. FAA arrangement involved HPD writing 
effective Program  Description (PD ) based on its own identified priorities and executing the approved 
activities based on a fixed budget with agreed deliverables.  
 Capacity has been partly built for HPD on financial management to implement the FAA with support 
from USAID Communicate for Health  staff. HPD is n ow able to prepare Plan of Action, deliverables 
and budget as per FHI 360/USAID requirements with minimal suppo rt. HPD staff were taken through 
a training session with focus on sub -award process or the procurement of external services. It also 
included  tips for writing effective Program Descriptions for grants or Scope of Work ( SOW ) for 
subcontracts. The broader tr aining objectives we re as follows:  
 1.      Identify basics and best practices to be used in writing a Program Description  (PD)  50 
 2.      Explain the legal significance of the PD  
3.      Learn the “5 Cs” of good PD writing  
4.      Understand the difference between results, deliverables , and requirements  
5.      Understand the components of a strong PD  [USAID Communicate for Health Feb 2016]  
 
3.4 CAPACITY BUILDING IN PROPOSAL WRITING  
 
The 23 Health Promotion Practitioners who were trained in the first cohort of the CADP in July 2016 
were brought together again and trained on proposal writing on February  27, 2017. This was found 
necessary because proposal writing was not initially included in the curriculum of CADP , but cohort 1  
participants requested for its inclusion in future training sessions which was done for CADP cohorts 2 and 3, and for all SfC cohort training s. A day was dedicated in the trainings for proposal writing. The 
training sought to strengthen proposal writing skills of trainees to enable them write winning proposals to access the Change Challenge Fund (CCF) under the USAID Communicate for Health project as well as source funds for other activities 
[GHS 2017 c]. Analysis of endline assessment once 
again showed  that 65% of cohort 1 CADP participants indicate d that they had written winnable 
proposals by 2019 compared with 38.9% for cohort 2 and 60.9% for cohort 3 [see Table 4 ]. This once 
again goes to possibly confirm, as previously, the higher quality of  training for cohort 1 participants 
than the subsequent trainings.  
 
3.5 INTERNSHIP  
  The CBSP included placing HPD officers to selected implementing partners (VIAMO, MULLEN LOVE and CREATIVE STORM Networks) for capacity building in an internship arrangement to learn firsthand some practical aspects of SBCC programming and implementation . It created opportunities 
to expand skills and knowledge outside the work place. A draft internship policy was developed in 
2016 with support from USAID Communicate for Health to guide the capacity building placement of 
key HPD staff to the selected implementing partners. The internship program afforded selected HPD 
staff to be part of an SBCC process, working alongside others who are experts in their field, to really understand the process and the components of its design, pretesting and production of campaigns, as well as the roles and responsibilities people play and the skills they draw from.   Based on the initial organizational assessment, it came out that the creative process is an  area HPD 
staff understand but  lack expertise or in -depth  knowledge of the processes and skills used to 
develop creative concepts and messaging for target groups. The same can be said of how to develop a campaign starting with a creative brief, how to deve lop an effective radio program  or radio spot , 
how to use story telling in their community approaches , or how to work with communities to 
develop a social documentary. It is possible to have such things explained in a classroom setting but the effect will be much less impactful than being involved in the actual “ doing” and “creating ” 
[USAID Communicate for  Health CBSP, 2016]. The internship program  design was based on these 
concepts,  as part of the capacity building plan for HPD.  
 MULLEN LOWE  51 
 In 2016, three HPD staff completed a three -month internship program with Mullen Lowe, the 
creative agency that worked with Communicate for Health and the GHS/HPD to refresh the 
GoodLife, Live I t Well brand. The internship appointments allowed HPD staff to experience working 
with a professional creative firm, taking them through the process of needs assessment, creation  of 
concept, brand development, and materials design. The participants from the material development 
unit of HPD had the opportunity to be involved in the refreshing and re launch of GoodLife, Live it 
Well campaign. Their capacity has been built as far as S BCC is concerned , and this has contributed 
greatly to the attraction of contracts for development of various SBCC materials as described in 
Session 2.2.  The text box shows comments by interns and the Chief Executive Officer of Mullen Lowe 
concerning the in ternship program.  
 
Assessment by Interns: “T he program  was very useful —particularly the hands -on experience with 
the GoodLife  campaign development,  including photo shooting, pretesting, and graphic design.”    
Assessment by LOWE: “C ontribution of trainees  increased as well as institutional knowledge of SBCC  
and enhancing the working environment through absorbing private sector culture.”   
 VIAMO  
 In 2018, VIAMO provided opportunities for HPD to develop skills and gain practical experience using 
mobile phones as tools for SBCC messaging (SMS and voice) and data collection. Two HPD Program Officers, worked with VIAMO  staff at their offices in Accra for six months from September 11, 2017 
(48 contact hours total). Sessions were facilitated by VIAMO’s SBCC Adviso r/Project Manager, with 
support from other VIAMO staff. They were taken through modules on digital and mobile health, 
productivity management tools and work ethics and efficiency.  
 The internship with VIAMO provided opportunities for HPD staff to develop knowledge and skills in 
how to plan, design, and deploy SBCC campaigns using cutting edge mobile technology, including those used for the project’s mobile phone cohort survey, as well as applications such as  Slack
3 and 
Wrike4. The internship also focused on improving the interns’ skills in other Microsoft Office suites 
including Google Office and MS Excel. They are now able to send high -volume SMS messages 
without support from VIAMO . Messages have thus far been sent to Communicate for Health and 
GHS staff at the national, regional, and district levels. Unfortunately, not much has been executed from the trainees since  the internship even though their technical capacity in SBCC messaging has 
been built, due to  delays in receiving approval of messages before transmitting, as well as  
diminished enthusiasm in that area of communication.  
 
CREATIVE STORM NETWORKS: SOCIAL MEDIA INTERNSHIP AND CAPACITY BUILDING  
 
There was a relaunch of the GoodLife  Social Media Platform in January 2018 with Creative Storm 
Networks, one of Communicate for Health’s partners that had designed and promoted the original 
                                                      
3 Slack facilitates instant and secure communication among colleagues to, for example, assign tasks, share documents, 
and collaborate.  
4 Wrike is an online project management software.   52 
 platform in 2017. A road map for transitioning the social media platform to the GHS was drafted and 
adopted  in February 2018 .  
 
Four HPD staff underwent a three -week internship program  during which  they understudied with 
the social media team at Creative Storm Networks  between April 9 –27. Training focused on hosting 
and managing social media platforms; recruiting new members on WhatsApp, Twitter, and Instagram; responding to and managing clients on the different platforms; and developing new social media groups. The training also covered skills in livestreaming indoor and outdoor health 
events to the general public,  measuring social media impact and socio- media monitoring , and  linking 
with other platforms for synergy. As part of the training program, participants covered the launch of 
the Wo rld Immunization Day, the 2018 MOH Annual Health Summit, and the 2018 World Malaria 
Day Commemoration .  
 Later the GHS/ HPD allocated an office space within the HPD offices at Korle Bu for the social media 
set-up. Communicate for Health installed four desktop computers , a printer , and two tablets, which 
facilitated smooth migration of the platform from Creative Storm Networks to HPD . Currently, the 
social media unit is manned by HPD officers and equipped at the Department to handle i nformation 
and also stream live activities of the GHS on the various social media platform as part of the structure of the new division.   The social media team livestreamed the elevation of HP department to Divisional Status and , more 
recently,  the 2
nd Maternal and C hild Health Conference on June 26- 28, 2019 , was streamed live by 
the unit, as well as the 8th Annual Newborn Stakeholders’ meeting from July  30–August  1, 2019. The 
training manual on social media that was developed for the training is available to trainees . So far 
the Facebook page established by the HPD social media unit has 38,900 likes and 39,000 followers as 
of June 26, 2019; Twitter  and Instagram have  1,302 and 1 ,314 followers respectively, even though 
their facilitators believe they could have done more after the training.  
 
3.6 GENDER ASSESSMENT AND TRAINING  
 
USAID requires that all new projects funded after July 2013 conduct a gender analysis/assessment. 
Consequently, gender mainstreaming capacity building was included in the CBSP of USAID 
Communicate  for Health initiative. A gender assessment was planned for and budgeted in the initial  
proposal to USAID for the USAID Communicate for Health  [USAID Communicate for Health 2015] . Dr. 
Andrea Bertone, director of the FHI 360 Gender Department traveled to Ghana from June 25 – July 
22, 2015, to conduct the gender assessment with the USAID Communicate for Health and HPD 
teams. During the last week of the trip (July 13 –14, 2015), Dr. Bertone facilitated a two -day gender 
workshop for 41 participants including 16  HPD and regional officers, representatives from GHS/FHD, 
USAID Communicate for Health, Ghana Community Radio Network, Creative Storm, VIAMO , and 
USAID implementing partners . The purpose for conducting the gender assessment and trainings 
during the project start -up year was to ensure that USAID Communicate for Health does not 
exacerbate unequal gender norms among individuals and groups, and that societal gender norms do not prevent  the project from achieving identified objectives. Topics covered during the training 
included: 1) o verview of gender and international development; 2) g ender synchronized 53 
 approaches —evidence for gender transformation; 3) g ender integration continuum —achieving 
gender transformation overview; 4) c onducting a gender assessment; 5) ge nder mainstreaming and 
gender integration; and 6) m easuring changes in gender norms  [USAID Communicate for Health Feb 
2016] .  
 
The impact of the gender training is difficult to measure now as there has not been many  direct 
activities in this area over the project period . 
  54 
 CHAPTER 4: CONCLUSIONS OF STRENGTHS/KEY ACHIEVEMENTS AND 
WEAKNESSES  
 
This chapter provides a summary of strengths/achievements and weaknesses/gaps, based on the literature and desk reviews, interviews with key stakeholders  at national, regional and district levels, 
baseline and endline assessment of technical capacity, and interactions with HPD officers over the years.  It is designed and arranged to answer the questions raised in the ToRs. Detailed de scriptions 
of various e lements have already been presented in earlier chapters.  Recommendations are 
provided in Chapter 5.  
 
4.1 Summary of Conclusions of Strengths, Weaknesses/Challenges per ToR  
 
The following sections summarize the conclusions to answer the questions as per the  ToR.  
 
ToR 1: Has Health Promotion Department (HPD) increased its capacity from 2015  to lead , design, 
development, coordinate , and implement evidence -based social and behavior  change campaigns?  
 
The answer is yes. Organizational technical capacity assessment of HPD to lead , design, 
development, coordinate , and implement evidence -based social and behavior  change campaigns 
showed that the endline organizational technical capacity assessment of performance increased from 58% in 2015 to 83.9% in 2019, an increase of 44.6%. The greatest actual increases were in the 
area of implementing and  monitoring change process, focusing and designing the communication 
strategy, and understanding the context through situation analysis. In contrast,  there was a 
deterioration of over 33% in the area of evaluation and  re-planning for outcome and sustainability, 
due mainly to lack of analysis and use of reported HP indicators, especially at the national level.  
 
The improved organizational technical capacity of HPD, especially in the area of SBCC development 
and implementation, is evidenced by the increasing number of key partners who have over the period sub -contracted HPD to develop and execute SBCC projects on their behalf and to their 
satisfaction. Some of the partners inclu de JICA, GIZ, JHPIEGO, PATH, CDC  and N ational Malaria 
Control Program . Almost all partners were impressed with the technical competence of HPD, 
especially at national level and in some regions. The consensus of partners is that HPD  has capable 
and competent staff who can work professionally if provided the  required resources and a favorable  
enabling environment.   
ToR 2: To what extent have Health Promotion Officers (HPOs)) applied the knowledge and skills 
acquired through participat ion in the CADP to develop proposals  and plan and implement evidence -
based social and behavior  change and health promotion campaigns?  
 The improved performance chalked by HPD came about over the period mainly through the 
development of a well- structured capacity building support plan (CBSP) to train HPOs and TOHP 
through CADP and SfC from national, regional , and district levels, through the instrumentality of its 
key partner, USAID Communicate for Health.  55 
  
There were three CADP training sessions over the period of support. Cohort CADP 1 participants 
assessed themselves highest as very high performing  at endline (30%), followed by cohort 3 CADP 
participants (17.4%) and cohort 2 CADP participants (11.1%). The observed differences were statistically significant (Fishers’ exact test of independence, p<0.001).  
 In terms of component areas in the CADP training curriculum that facilitated application of knowledge and skills acquired during the training, most of CAD P participants in all cohorts assessed 
themselves high in areas such as understanding social and community mobilization (95%), planning and coordinating SBCC ( 80%), and creating and implementing effective SBCC ( 80%). Interestingly, cohort 1 participants scored themselves highest in almost all categories followed by cohort 3 and cohort 2.   The conclusion is that the changes made after CADP cohort 1 training (such as adding another day to training period) did not significantly affect the self- assessment of  cohorts 2 and 3 participants as far 
as their performance after training is concerned.  
 In terms of areas that facilitated application of knowledge and skills acquired during the training, most of CADP participants in all cohorts assessed themselves low in  application of knowledge and 
skills acquired in mobile technology (30%), effective SBCC  through TV documentary  (20%) , 
understand ing social marketing (20%) and understanding formative assessment in SBCC (50%) 
compared with other components. However, they scored themselves high in all the other areas such 
as understanding social and community mobilization (95%), planning and coordinating SBCC ( 80%), 
and creating and implementing effective SBCC ( 80%). Interestingly, cohort 1 participants  again  
scored themselv es highest in almost all categories followed by cohort 3 and cohort 2. There is the 
need to review  the training syllabus and either change the content (especially in areas where 
persistently the participants scored themselves low, as there appears to be mi nimal impact on their 
performance) or change the facilitators or mode of delivering these topics.  
 
In terms of what they had done differently by 2019 as a result of their participation in the CADP, all cohorts scored themselves low in the following areas: sourcing funds for SBCC (45%), using mobile technology to communicate to target audience (40%) and developing indicators to monitor SBCC activities (40%).  
 
Tor 3: To what extent have Technical Officers for Health Promotion (TOHP) applied the knowledge and  
skills acquired through participation in the Set for Change (SfC) Action Learning sets program to 
develop proposals  and plans and implement evidence -based social and behavior  change and health 
promotion campaigns?  
 
There were two training sessions  for TOHPs: SfC cohort 1 and SfC combined cohorts 2 and 3. Among 
cohort 1 , 33.3%  assessed themselves in 2019 as very high performing  in application of knowledge 
and skills acquired from the trainings compared with 0% in 2016 before training [44.4% in 2019 vs. 0% in 2016 for high performing].  
 56 
 Compared to the self -assessment of cohort 1, only 26.3% of  SfC cohorts 2/3 participants assessed 
themselves in 2019 as very high performing  in application of knowledge and skills acquired from the 
trainings compared with 6.7% in 2017 before training. The differences observed are statistically 
significant  (p<0.001) . 
 
It can be concluded that any changes made after cohort 1 training did not improve  outcome of 
future training of c ohort 2/3 participants  as far as confidence  in application of knowledge and skills 
acquired by participants during SfC training is concerned.  Reduction of training sessions from four 
(SfC cohort 1) to just one (SfC cohorts 2/3) appears to have adversely affected their post -training 
performance.  
 In terms of areas that facilitated application of knowledge and skills acquired during the training, SfC 
participants assessed themselves low in applying their understanding of SBCC theory (44.4%), creating and implementing effective SBCC (33.3%), understanding social marketing (33.3%), using mobile technology (0%), and writing winnable proposals (44.4%). However, they assessed themselves high in understanding social and community mobilization ( 100%) and  working effectively 
with the media (88.9%).  
 The responses from the supervisors affirm their overall positive assessment of enhanced 
performance of CADP and SfC participants after the training. Not surprisingly, 86.7% of the supervisors indicated that they would recommend the CADP and SfC training to other HP officers who had not yet benefited from them, in view of what they had witnessed in those who had 
completed the training.  
 
CCF 
 
So far, 15  CADP and SfC participants have received initial funding for various SBCC projects at the 
local level. Early results from activities funded by CADP and SfC beneficiaries look impressive. Beneficiaries are highly motivated, knowing that they now have a little financial support to embark on their own self- designed simple projects at district and community levels. T he evidence so far 
shows that they are able to negotiate with stakeholders , and their working relations with colleagues 
have improved , enabling them to mobilize  community and other support to their planned SBCC 
projects.  Four beneficiaries of CCF  recently showcased their projects by making presentations during 
the 2nd Maternal and Child Health Conference on June 26– 28, 2019, to the admiration of many.
 
 
ToR 4: To what extent and in what ways has the Health Promotion Department increased its capacity 
for evid ence -based social and behavior  change communication through the different capacity building 
approaches rolled out by the Communicate for Health project?  
 A number of other capacity building approaches (apart from CADP , SfC and CCF ) were rolled up by 
the USAID Communicate for Health project to build capacity of HPD in SBCC. The approaches included:  
 57 
 1. Co-location : USAID Communicate for Health project team co- located with the HPD at national 
level to facilitate the application of an effective and efficient form of institutional and individual 
capacity building to ensure local ownership and sustainability. They worked as a blended team to conceive and implement a comprehensive social and behavior change communication and health promotion campaign. USAID Commu nicate for Health staff supported, coached, and problem -solved 
with their HPD counterparts, enabling them to take the lead in planning, implementing, and monitoring SBCC project activities.  
 
2. Internship s: To complement the CADP and SfC training program s, the CBSP included promotion of 
an embedded internship program  where officers were embedded into private sector institutions 
(Mullen Lowe, VIAMO , and Creative Storm Networks) for hands -on practical training in various 
aspects of SBCC programs.  
 
In 2016, t hree HPD staff from the M aterial Development Unit of HPD completed a 3- month 
internship program at Mullen Lowe. The internship has enhanced the technical capacity of the 
Material Development Unit, and has contribute d greatly to the attraction of SBCC contr acts from 
various partners and their successful execution as mentioned above.  
 The internship with VIAMO provided opportunities for HPD staff to develop knowledge and skills in 
how to plan, design, and deploy SBCC campaigns using cutting edge mobile techn ology. They are 
now able to send high -volume SMS messages without support from VIAMO . Unfortunately, not 
much has been executed from the trainees after the internship even though their technical capacity 
in SBCC messaging has been built  mostly due to dimin ished interest in that area after their training . 
 
Three staff from the Health Promotion Department and another from the FHD had a 3 -week 
internship training in 2018 with Creative Storm Networks —a media production firm, as part of the 
social media contract  with USAID Communicate for Health. Currently, a s ocial media unit has been 
established and manned by HPD officers and partly equipped at the Department to handle Information and also stream live activities of the GHS on the various social media platform as part of the structure of the new division. The social media team livestreamed the elevation of HP 
department to Divisional Status and , more recently , the 2nd Maternal and child Health Conference 
on June 26– 28, 2019 , as well as the 8th Annual Newborn Stakeholders’ meeting from 30th July  30–
August 1, 2019.  So far , the Facebook page  established by the social media unit of HPD has 38,900 
likes and 39,000 followers as of June 26, 2019; Twitter has 1302 and Instagram has 1314 followers , 
even though their facilitators are of the opinion that they could have done more after the training.  
 
ToR 6: What important successes and lessons can be learned through roll out of the HPD capacity 
building program for future programming?  
   A number of lessons have been learned during implem entation of the USAID Communicate for 
Health partnership project with HPD.  
 58 
 a.) Focusing only on “hard” issues of project implementation is not helpful and will result in conflicts 
and delayed implementation of activities. The “softer” aspects  such as attitudinal changes, 
commitment , and motivation are equally important ; projects should invest in addressing these areas 
also. Tolerance and mutual respect of all partners are important for successful implementation of projects.  
 b.) It is necessary to build conflict resolution mechanisms into projects, such as support from senior highly -respected officers with enough clout to intervene when things are not moving well.  
  c.) One lesson is aptly quoted from a senior officer of USAID Communicate for Health : “An added 
component of community engagement or mobilization to the USAID Communicate for Health Project would have added value to the mass media communication , which was the main focus of the 
project. There was a gap in terms of community mobilization and engagement, thus the interface 
between the health system and the community suffered. This element sat with another implementing partner , and without effective coordination to bring all the arms of SBCC together 
under one umbrella (that is ma ss media, advocacy , and community mobilization), realization of SBCC 
outcomes would be difficult. In the future , it will be important to ensure there is synergy and 
complementarity of “above the line” and “below the line” SBCC efforts.” 
 d.) Co -location en hances performance and improves efficiency, as it provided opportunity for 
transfer of knowledge and skills from one partner to another . 
 
ToR 7: What challenges were encountered during roll out of the capacity building programs that could 
inform the design  of future capacity building programs?   
 Despite the impressive achievements over the past 5 years  of the project, a number of weaknesses , 
gaps , and challenges have been identified during the assessment which have to be addressed going 
forward.  These are based on my analysis of the various interviews from all stakeholders and my 
inside knowledge of the project from its inception. The key focus once again is on the technical capacity sup port plan . 
 Technical Capacity Building  – CADP and SfC  
Despite the carefully planned and executed CADP and SfC training plans, the participants scored themselves low in certain areas such as knowledge and skills acquired in mobile technology, effective SBCC through TV documentary, understanding social marketing, and understan ding 
formative assessment in SBCC. There is the need to revisit  the training syllabus and either change 
the content or the facilitators or mode of delivering these topics . The mode of delivery of CADP and 
SfC is still too didactic and lacks practical sessions which were  originally envisaged. SfC was designed 
to have participants  determine the issues to be addressed  prior to  the training, but that was not 
made clear  and had to be predetermined , hence partly losing the ACTION LEARNING intention.  
 The pr ocess for selection of candidates is too rigorous, esp ecially the requirement of a n overly 
detailed proposal development process for selection to SfC . This has the potential to limit  many 
potential officers at district level from benefiting. The original S fC training was designed for around 59 
 10 participants  from  each cohort  who were expected to attend a three  to four-day program on 
multiple occasions. This required a lot of travel time and logistics so organizers  ended up adding 
days per sessions and combine d participants per training to make them more cost  effective. In 
actual practice, 10 participants took part in SfC cohort 1 over four  sessions, but only 17 participants 
made up cohorts 2 and 3, which were  combined in to one training session due to logistical and 
financial constraints. This appears to have affected self- assessed performance , as SfC cohort 1 
participants typically scored themselves higher than combined SfC cohort 2 and 3.  
 
In order to reinforce and consolidate learning,  Communicate for Health was expected to work with 
VIAMO to develop motivational messages for the CADP and SfC beneficiaries after their training,  but 
this could not materialize due to funding issues. Currently , the training program  is dependent on 
donor support from USAID Communicate for Health and is not sustainable if not internalized.  
 
Specific to CCF, owing to delays in release of funds due to circumstances beyond the project’s control, only one round of CCF awards had been made as of  time of assessmen t in June 2019, 
although the plan was to make three awards during the entire project lifespan.  
 
Co-location  
There appears to have been an initial “cultural shock” due to a different work ethic (public vs. 
private mentality).  This tense atmosphere at the start of project support affected the transfer of 
knowledge and skills from USAID Communicate for Health officers to their twin counterparts . This 
initial atmosphere was not conducive to learning and exchange of ideas —a key objective of the co-
location strategy, but eventually the situation improved.    Internship  
One weakness of the internship program  for HPD was the low number of officers who benefitted 
from it: two at VIAMO , three  at Mullen Lowe , and three  at Creative storm Networks . The problem is 
that the capacity building  depends on a few officers who may be overburdened as work load 
increases  or if they leave the HPD (an emerging threat).  
 The other challenge is the long process of clearance and approval of SBCC messages for VIAM O, 
which affected  timely delivery of SBCC messages e.g ., through SMS, a prerequisite for using such 
mode of delivery . The expensive nature of SMS messaging compared with other s ocial media 
platforms such as Wh atsApp  make it unattractive to many. The CCF gr oup is using WhatsApp to 
communicate and support one another, without any clearance requirements,  and it is free . 
 Another  challenge faced by the interns was that some of them were busy elsewhere and so there 
was the need for constant readjustment of schedules by the private firms, thereby affecting learning.  The team spirit among interns who were trained at Creative Storm Networks was strained 
initially, and this has partly affected their output after the training. They have found it difficult to 
share information on various social media platforms, and according to the resource person during 
the internship, he has not been impressed with their performance even though they have the 
technical capacity to deliver if they so wish.  
 60 
 Another challenge was the provision of required  resources to participants after the internship 
training to implement what had been learned. For instance, the newly established social media unit 
lacks a video editor  for effective functioning. 
 Stretch assignments  
The CBS P also was designed to include stretch assignments for regional and district level staff to 
work at the national or regional level on a specific task or activity such as developing a campaign or the M&E framework. It was supposed to provide the opportunity for traine es to be challenged, use 
new skills, learn new work contexts , and experience a different setting, as they worked  on an SBCC -
related task with specified deliverables . Unfortunately, this did not materializ e. 
 Peer Mentoring  
The CBSP envisages that selected past participants of CAD P and SfC will offer support and mentoring 
to their colleagues who have yet to have attended a development program . With the exception of a 
few past participants (such as Ms. Uzomah of HPD becoming a facilitator and coordinator  for CADP 
and SfC after training), this initiative did not materialize  during the period and is an area of weakness 
that needs to be addressed in future technical capacity plans.  
 61 
 CHAPTER FIVE : RECOMMENDATIONS  
 
Based on the interviews, findings, observations , and analysis of all that has happened within  HPD 
from 2015 to 2019, the following recommendations are made to enhance capacity building initiatives of the new HP Division moving forward.  
 
1. Undertake a training needs assessment of the HP Division officers based on the defined 
responsibilities and expected roles of key officers of the new HP Division, as well as on the job descriptions of Health P romotion practitioners before any training is started.   
 
2. Continue and institutionalize  the capacity building effort through CADP and SfC and other 
technical courses to further build capacity of HP officers, while taking cognizance of 
weaknesses and suggestions provided by participants. Specifically, there must be more focus 
on improving quality of delivery of topics and practical skill acquisition during the training (including use of simulation exercises) , and less on theoretical concepts , which have not 
proven that useful for the participants. There was no evidence that extending the duration of training after the first cohort training improved performance, and this issue should be further discussed after review of the course content.  
 
3. Explore other ways of providing technical capacity support to HPOs and TOHP to complement current CADP and SfC approaches, such as o nline courses, access to e -books , 
and use of digital applications for workshops such as through Skype and Zoom to minimize 
training cost s and enhance efficiency .  
 
4. The modified CADP and SfC should be formalized with the professional Allied Council as a Continuous Professional Development (CPD) course for HP officers. This will serve as an 
incentive for HP officers to participate in such courses.  
 
5. CADP and SfC should be incorporated into the curriculum of the Kintampo College of Health 
and Wellbeing and ot her HP training institutions to  improve capacity of trainees at pre -
service level . 
 
6. Rapidly deploy CCF for CADP and SfC graduates  in future projects to run concurrently with 
the mass media campaigns to create the needed synergy for rapid behavior  change.  Such an 
initiative should be built into the normal budget of HP Division from the Government of 
Ghana, with funding support from interested partners as required.  
 
7. Institutionalize  the internship capacity building system (two  weeks or so) with creative firms  
or local or international organizations doing media, social marketing, social media or SBCC work, for key technical staff . A formal MoU should be developed with parties specifying the 
roles and responsibilities of each partner  in the internship program . If properly structured  
and promoted , many more HP officers can benefit from the program  at minimum cost, as 
other partners may buy into the initiative as part of their support.   62 
  
8. In addition to SBCC, other areas where capacity building is required and proposed include 
training in leadership and management, advocacy and networking, strategic planning, resource mobilization, policy development, health promotion practice, knowledge transfer , 
and research.  
 
9. Establish annual best HPO and TOHP awards as envisaged in current National HP Strategy to 
boost morale and encourage competition.  
 
10. Initiate an annual HP conference during which beneficiaries of CADP, SfC , CCF, and other 
capacity building initiatives can be invited to showcase what they are doing currently in their respective areas  after training. Partners can be invited and encouraged to sponsor aspects of 
the program  and make presentations. HP Division can learn from Family Health Division , 
which has successfully organized annual conferences  on M aternal, Child, and Newborn 
Health , which were  well patronized locally and internationally.

 1. Purpose of the Capacity Building Support Plan (CBSP)  
 
The Capacity Building Support Plan (CBSP) sets out the overall approach offered  by the USAID 
funded project Communicate for Health to the Ghana Health Services Health Promotion Department (GHS HPD).  
 Developed in collaboration with the Ghana Health Service Health Promotion Department and Human Resources Directorate, local Ghanaian p artners and, international development partners, it 
sets out:  
• the specific activities available and the associated learning objectives,  
• who these activities are designed for  
• how they can be accessed  
• how they will be delivered and when.  
 2. Background  
 One of the aims of National Health Promotion Policy (2007) and the draft National Strategy and 
Action Plan for Health Promotion (2014 -2018) is to build the capacity of health promotion staff at all 
levels.  
 Communicate for Health is a five -year USAID funded  project (2014 –2019). It is one of a suite of 
USAID funded health projects and as such works in a coordinated way with other USAID 
implementing partners to support the Government of Ghana (GoG). The Health Promotion 
Department (HPD) within the Ghana Health  Service (GHS) is Communicate for Health’s key GoG 
partner. The project has three key results areas of which one directly relates to strengthening the capacity of the HPD.  
 
Expected Result #1:  Improved behavior changes in family planning, water, sanitation  and hygiene 
(WASH), nutrition, maternal and child health (MCH), and malaria prevention and treatment through the development and implementation of social and behavior change communication (SBCC) strategies.  
Expected Results #2 : Health Promotion Department  (HPD) capacity strengthened to effectively 
coordinate and deliver SBCC and health promotion campaigns.  
Expected Result #3:  Capacity of one local organization with social marketing capacity developed and 
strengthened to receive direct USAID funding.  
 3. Aim and Objectives of the Capacity Building Support Plan (CBSP)  
 The aim of the CBS plan is to strategically strengthen the capacity of the HPD to further increase its effectiveness in coordinating and delivering social and behavior change communication (SBCC) and health promotion (HP) campaigns.   Objectives of the CBS Plan are as follows :
 
 73 
 • Address specific capacity gaps in both the areas of SBCC technical and personal effectiveness 
skills that were identified through the SBCC capacity assessment conducted at the national, regional and district health promotion levels in May 2015. 
 
• Increase HPD’s ability to conceive of, design, develop, implement and rigorously evaluate 
SBCC and health promotional campaigns and materials .  
• Support HPD to improve its tec hnical service delivery profile as experts in delivering quality 
SBCC programs and materials both internally within the GHS, and externally with development partners and interested partners .  
• Provide a practical learning experience that directly connects participants’ daily work, current 
SBCC activities and challenges in Ghana with knowledge of practical and theoretical SBCC 
processes through training and other development opportunities such as stretch assignments.  
• Ensure that those who have gained knowledge and skills from the CBS share these with other members of the HPD at different HP levels through an organized system of mentoring.  
• Create the beginnings of a community of practice through active networks of health 
promotion staff across the country. To connect with each other to exchange information, 
ideas, good practice and provide peer support and encouragement.  
• Attract the most motivated and committed HPD staff through a competitive application process who will commit and be able to mentor others upon completion of their training .  
 4. Core E lements of the Capacity Building Support Program  (CBSP)  
 In recognition of people’s different learning styles , the CBS plan offers a range of approaches. Core 
elements are outlined below and described in more detail later in this document.  
 
Change Agent Development Program:  One week development program covering a range of technical 
areas and skills taught through lectures, use of case studies and practical group exercises. There will be two different program curriculum, one designed for national and regional staff and one for the new cadre of TOHPs. Both programs are designed to fill the identified skills gaps for each group.  
 
Set for Change:  A hybrid action learning set with taught technical inputs designed for  Technical 
Officers for Health Promotion (TOHPs). Participants will meet together on four separate occasions/sessions over a six -to-eight month period. Each of the four sessions will last 1.5 days and 
will be facilitated by a qualified and experienced lear ning set facilitator. The sets are designed to 
support the new cadre of TOHPs to succeed in their new role through personal development and effectiveness skill building such as critical thinking and problem solving, advocacy and building strategic partners hips for change. Technical skills input will support the implementation of national 
campaigns at the local level through communities, local organizations and key advocates.  
 
Free online courses  providing more in -depth  theory and practice in technical aspects of designing 
and conducting SBCC. USB modems will be offered  to those with  limited internet access under a 
carefully managed loan scheme.  74 
 Support to individuals in creating personal development plans  and gaining access to free on line 
resources and identifying continuing professional development opportunities.  
 
Gender integration trainings  to improve technical competencies in creating gender sensitive 
programming and activities for national and some regional staff.  
 
Stretch assignments  will provide the opportunity for individuals to be challenged to use new skills 
and apply new knowledge. Stretch assignments are supervised, discrete pieces of work with clear 
objectives to be conducted over a given period of time and lead to the producti on of specified 
deliverables.  
 
Internships/practicums  will provide the opportunity for national and/or regional staff to work with 
Communicate for Health core partners or contractors such as Lowe Lintas, Ghana Community Radio 
Network, VOTO Mobile , or Crea tive Storm. Internees will be actively involved in designing or 
delivering elements of the SBCC campaigns whilst learning new skills on the job. Like stretch assignments these will be supervised, discrete pieces of work with clear objectives to be conducte d 
over a given period of time and lead to the production of specified deliverables  
 
Peer Mentoring:  Past participants of CAD and SfC will be asked to offer support and mentoring to 
their colleagues. A structured system will be in place to enable this. This  support could be through 
the transference of new knowledge and skills by providing technical guidance or sharing resources or help to develop a PDP.  
 
Change Challenge Fund:  Is a competitive performance -based funding opportunity. It allows recently 
trained  CADP or SfC participants to apply for a small resource to enable them to utilize  their new 
knowledge and skills to conceive of, develop and implement small- scale innovative SBCC 
activity/national campaign implementation at the district or regional level.  
 Post training support to increase consolidation of learning and motivation to apply new knowledge and skills in the work setting through mobile phone messages, prompts to act and reminders on behaviors and practices, refresher tips, quizzes and games to consolidate learning and reinforce the adoption of particular skills or actions on the job will be received by all CAD and SfC graduates.  
 
“Best Health Promoting District Award ” and “Best Health Promoter Award ” concept s are designed to provide a 
motivator for districts and individual health promotion staff to aim for. Other GHS services that have awarded 
staff for excellence have demonstrated that such recognition and acknowledgement from peers motivate and 
encourage staff. In the case of health promotion t his increased effort and improved service will hopefully 
improve health outcomes for the community served. It is anticipated that the awards will be made annually and developed in conjunction with support from a number of private sector partnerships. Commu nicate for 
Health will provide support in the development stage of these awards , which will be owned, managed , and 
maintained by the GHS HPD.  
 75 
 5. What has informed the content of the Capacity Building Support Plan?  
 
The curriculum and learning objectives of the different types of support have been informed by several  fact-finding activities. These include:  
1. A rapid organizational/institutional assessment of the GHS HQ HPD staff knowledge and skills of social and behavior change communication conducted in April/May 2015.  
2. Individual capacity assessments conducted with five HPD regional staff. Other assessments will be added as they are conducted such as those on applicants selected for the Change 
Agent Development Program  (CADP)  and Set for Change  (SfC) Action  Learning Sets.  
3. The GHS Human Resource Division and the GHS Health Promotion Department supported by 
Communicate for Health have conducted a review of the job qualifications and responsibilities for HP officers.  
4. A series of all- day focus group style workshops were conducted with a group of TOHPs from 
a selection of regions to discuss and explore capacity needs and job challenges.  
 6. Change Agent Development 5 Day Program  
6.1. The CAD Program  
The Change Agent Development Program (CADP) is a one week program designed to strengthen the individual technical capacity of select national, regional and district -level staff through technical 
presentations followed by questions and discussion, use of case studies, and practical group exercises. Participative approaches to engage people fully will be an important focus as will the integration of the current and emerging health priorities and SBCC campaigns. In addition to 
technical skills the CAD will seek to improve the personal effectiveness and leadership style of the 
participants.  
The program  will be facilitated by an experienced external consultant with the Communicate for 
Health Capacity Building Advisor. Some taught contributions will be made by local experts in the different technical areas.  
 6.2 The CADP Beneficiaries  
The CADP is a tailored capacity building program to meet the needs of national and regional staff. Approximately 20 participants are expected to participate in the national and regional CADP in project year 2. This will be treated as a pilot and lessons learned will inform changes to the CADP delivered to TOHPs in years 3 and 4 of the project.   The CADP in year 2 of the project will be conducted in Kumasi or Accra over 5 days including one or two evening guest speaker sessions. To consolidate  learning, incentivize and prompt participants to 
adopt behavior s and utilize learning at their respective workplaces long after the training has 
finished a series of motivational mobile phone messages, games and messages and quizzes will be sent to partic ipants.

7. Set for Change “Action Learning Set”  80 
 7.1 The ‘Set for Change’ model   
 
The Set for Change  (SfC) is a hybrid approach that 
combines an action learning set model with taught 
technical inputs and practical hands on group work to promote critical thinking and problem solving, increase technical knowledge and skills as well as build confidence, create a greater sense of self and improve personal effectivenes s.  
 
Action Learning is a distinctive form of learning and 
capacity building ideal for the new cadre of TOHPs to help them carve out this new role, develop strategies and tactics to deal with the complexity of the environment they work in, manage relations hips with 
the range of stakeholders, navigate the organizational 
culture and work collaboratively with colleagues,  create opportunities  and manage the challenges 
they will face. The hybrid action learning set offers a facilitated approach to help TOHPs un derstand 
the context in which they work as well as provide new knowledge and skills to enable them to be as effective as possible in their new role.  Beyond their strength to conduct small -scale activities, they 
also need to harness all possible channels, social networks, people, and opportunities to promote positive behavior change and influence the creation of an enabling environment for people to adopt new behaviors. The action learning model of planning, action, reflection and learning will provide a framework for discussions and create confidence to experiment in the workplace, bring back results 
to the group, reflect and learn together.  
 The TOHPs positions are filled mostly by less experienced staff new to the GHS and recent graduates from the College  of Health and Wellbeing - Kintampo. The position itself is new within the District 
Health Management Team (DHMT) and the role as it develops will need to be more clearly defined. By the time the action learning sets start the job descriptions for the Heal th Promotion Department 
will have been reviewed and the role of the TOPHs more clearly defined not only for the benefit of the TOHPs themselves but the rest of the DHMT.   The learning set offers a process for TOHP to present a problem or situation from th eir work place 
and through a series of structured questioning be able to see the situation differently and chart a course of action. They will agree actions and commitments  to fulfil in their work setting then report 
and reflect on in the next learning set meeting. Peer -to-peer learning establishes strong 
relationships and a supportive exchange that extends long after the learning sets have finished. It also helps establish a strong sense of identity and sense of belonging to a wider health promotion 
department. Creating the right organizational and professional culture for health promotion to be 
effective, evidence based and collectively reflective is important to the success of a unified and active health promotion function nationally.  
 
81 
 In addition to the action learning component of the SfC there will be the taught sessions delivered by 
experts on a range of topics such as M&E, community mobilization, program management, use of mobile technology for SBCC. Learning from taught sessions will be consolidated through practical group exercises. Important foci threaded throughout the meetings will be the emerging health priorities and current SBCC campaigns, coordination of SBCC at the local level and the HP M&E framework (currently under development). Evening sp eakers will be organized  to provide the TOHPs 
with insights into different organizational cultures and professional roles such as the local assembly, NGOs and development partners.  
 7.2 Set for Change Beneficiaries  
 SfC is for the TOHPs working at the district and regional level. It is recognized  that these are new 
roles and positions and will therefore need to become established within the DHMT. This provides an enormous opportunity to promote SBCC but also presents some challenges. Some of the TOHPs may not have held a position before and may benefit from support in developing strategies and approaches to establish themselves effectively and appropriately within the DHMT and district context.  
In addition many of the TOHP are graduates from the College of Health and Wellbeing, Kintampo where a good basic training has been provided. The taught inputs will supplement this with advanced technical skills training and practical hands on practice.  
 7.3 The Application Process  
 The application process requires prospective applicants to provide the following information:  
• health status and known social and behavioral barriers of the community they work in, supported by recent data 
 
• an outline of the key health challenges  
• the role  they perceive SBCC to have in addressing these health challenges  
• a description of their role and their most notable success in this role, and finally,  
• an outline of their development needs and reason (s) why they want to participate in the SfC.  
 7.4 Av ailable Placements on the SfC  
 There will be six Set for Change  (SfC) action -learning sets over the life of the Communicate for Health 
project involving approximately 10 HP staff in each. Two will commence in Year 2 and a further two will take place each year in year 3 and 4 of the Communicate for Health project. The available placements are summarized below:  
 
• 2015/16   20 places (i.e. two  sets per year)  
• 2016/17   20 places (i.e. two  sets per year)  
• 2017/18  20 places (i.e. two  sets per year)  
 7.5 Set for C hange Format and Content  82 
  
Each SfC action learning set will involve 10 people. They will meet four  times over a 6 -month period, 
each meeting will last 1.5 days and include an after -dinner  session with external contributions from 
technical experts or key stakeholders/strategic partners.   Each SfC meeting will be run in four sections:  
• Section one will be an opportunity for a member of the group to bring a real -life current 
issue or a problem from their work life into a safe, structured and facilitated session.  
• Section two will focus on a technical input session drawn from the Change Agent Development program. The exact program for each set will be determined by  the needs of 
the group identified through pre assessment and group agreement. Once these have been established then the technical inputs will be determined. It is expected that the CADP program will be drawn upon given the SfC participants have similar needs but will not 
participate in both the SfC and the CADP . 
• Section three will be an after -dinner session where an external contributor will be invited to 
offer specialist input such as:  
o  how to use mobile technology for SBCC or how to work with development  partners, 
or understanding decentralization and the opportunities for SBCC, and or  
o experience and contextual insights of a particular organizational culture or 
professional role such as understanding the role and how to influence the district and regional health directors, or the role of the regional Minister.  
• Section Four in day two will be in two parts.  
o Part one will be dedicated to personal development and effectiveness building and gaining insights and personal leadership skills required to be successful in the TOPHs role. The MBTI and other tools for self -reflection , personal effectiveness will be used  
o Part two participants will work in sub groups on specific SBCC work related activities that are being tested out in the work setting and experiences, progress and challenges brought back to the sub group to share and plan for how to further the work in their districts.  
• The final hour will be dedicated to planning and personal commitments of each participant 
for completion for the next set SfC . At the very end of each SfC learning set meeting there 
will be a short group discussion and reflection on how well the meeting worked and whether aspects need to be changed or done differently next time.  
 The exact program  for each SfC learning set will be determined by the needs of the group identified 
through pre assessment and group agreement. Selected technical taught sessions will be drawn from the CADP and replicated in the SfC.  
 7.6  The application procedure and selection criteria for the SfC.  
 
Applicants  MUST meet initial eligibility requirements before they are eligible to apply.  
• Serve at least 12 months after appointment as TOHP and not be within 3 years to retirement.  83

B. The applications will be managed in the same way as those for the CADP  
 8. Change Challenge Fund (CCF)  
 8.1 The Change Challenge Fund  
The Change Challenge Fund (CCF) has been set up to ensure CAD and SfC  participants have the 
opportunity to use and apply their new knowledge and skills in their daily work and are not constrained by lack of resources. Participants are encouraged to think boldly and innovatively as well 
as systematically and based on sound information and are invited to apply for resources to put into 
practice and utilize the skills and knowledge they have developed. This fund is

Process evaluation:  A summative evaluation form will be sent to awardees, chair of the strategic 
partnership leading the initiative and the respective district director/regional director at the end of the award period at the point the last installment is made. This will require completion, to cover what has worked well and what less well and why. Recommendations for improvements for the following round of awards will be requested. These questionnaires  will be aggregated by the HPD 
nominated person and a report submitted to the CCF Management Board to determine changes to the process in the next round.  
 9. Stretch Assignments  
 9.1 What are stretch assignments?  
Stretch assignments are designed to give members of HP staff the opportunity to conduct a work assignment that is more demanding than would be normally expected in their current role. It provides the opportunity to be challenged, use new skills, learn new work contexts and experience a different setting, working on an SBCC related task. Stretch assignments are time limited. They are 86 
 supervised, discrete pieces of work with clear objectives that lead to the production of specified 
deliverables.  
 
9.2 What kind of assignments are available?  
A number of assignments will be made available over the course of the Communicate for Health projec t. They will take different forms for example a district TOHP may conduct a stretch assignment 
at the regional level conducting an assignment or task that would normally be expected of a regional HPO or an assignment in a different environment such as a di strict assembly or a community radio.  
Stretch assignments  for regional staff may be at the national level or assignments for national staff in 
other national divisions. There will also be some stretch assignments/internships with sub partners to gain dire ct experience of working in different settings that are relevant to the SBCC process such 
as a creative agency managing media buys, filming and interviewing in the community, conducting formative research, with a TV station, a community radio station, an NGO, a mobile technology organization  etc. 
 9.3 Who is Eligible?  
A set number of stretch assignments will be available for health promotion staff from all three levels ,district, regional and national. These will be made available at the start of years 3, 4  and 5.  
 9.4 What is the application process?  
To be discussed and agreed.  
Could be a matching of staff to the assignments.  
 10. Mentoring  10.1 What are mentors  
Mentorship is a relationship in which a more experienced or more knowledgeable person, the ment or, helps to guide a less experienced or less knowledgeable person. The mentor  may be older 
or younger but will have a certain area of expertise to share or help steer, guide or counsel the 
mentee.  
 10.2 Who are the mentors  Mentors will be drawn from the HP staff whom have participated in a CADP or a SfC . During the 
CADP and the SfC program s a session will be dedicated to discussing the role of a mentor, providing 
training on the skills of mentorship. This will be supplemented with a handbook to support mentors fulfil this role.   
The HPD will develop a process of matching mentors and mentees (see section 10.3) The mentor will 
share insights, resources and key learning points from the CADP or SfC and assist the mentee in the creation of a personal development plan.  
 The mentor program  aims to support the creation of a community of practice within the HPD by 
creating a structure for the cascade of knowledge. This will also help improve performance and motivation and build strong relationships between HP staff. The result sought is an appreciation of 87 
 the value of routine sharing ideas, lessons learned, successes and failures, challenges and 
opportunities with colleagues and peers to provide support, inspiration and evidence.  
 Ment ors will be available to prospective mentees during year 3, 4 and 5.  
 10.3 Process for the Allocation of Mentors?  
To be discussed  
 
11. On line courses from Witts University  
11.1 Who are these online courses for  
11.2 What will the on line courses cover  
11.3 What is the application process for these online courses  
 
12. Personal Development Plans (PDPs)  
12.1 What are PDPs?  
 A personal development plan is a structured way of thinking about the range of technical and personal skills you may need to develop and improve upon in order to do your current job effectively. It is also a way to help an individual think about what they may want to progress their career in the future and plan for that too. PDPS are the basis of Continuing Professional Development (CDP). CPD  embraces everything that you do to improve your job performance and is 
another way to ensure that you achieve the right abilities to do your job and maintain/enhance your 
expertise and your ‘lifelong employability’.  
 
12.2 What support is available to develop a PDP?  
The SfC and the CADP both have allocated time where participants will be supported to look at their role and their job description and  think about the kinds of activities and responsibilities they are 
required to conduct. Participants will then examine their strengths and weaknesses not only in technical knowledge and skills but also personal skills such as working within a team, personal presentation skills, influencing skills etc. and begin to establish areas where they feel they need to improve and develop.  
 Participants will work with a template that sets out questions they need to answer.  
What do I want to learn, what do I have to do, what support and resources will I need, how can I access these, how will I measure success, how regularly will I review  progress? Participants will be 
encouraged to develop SMART goals for themselves to help ensure they are clear about what they 
want to do, and that this is attainable, realistic and time bound,  
 Given financial resources are likely to be limited guidance will be offered on how to access free resources such as online courses, consider self -directed learning through journals or electronic 
resources, shadowing more senior colleagues or colleagues in other organizations  you need to 
understand better, stretch assignments and to think creatively about how they can ach ieve their 
learning objectives.  
 88 
 PDPs need to be realistic and ach ievable but non the less aspirational.  
Part of the mentoring role will be to offer support to mentees in developing PDPs.

 CHAPTER 1: UNINTENDED CAPACITY BUILDING INITIATIVES FOR HPD  
 
1.1 Purpose  
 Volume one of the capacity assessment report focused exclusively on the Social Behavioral 
Change Communication  (SBCC) technical capacity improvements of Health Promotion 
Department (HPD ) resulting directly from USAID Communicate for Health capacity initiative as 
contained in the Capacity Building Support Plan (CB SP). This volume goes beyond the C BSP and 
assesses all the unintended outcomes resulting from various capacity building initiatives  of the 
USAID Communicate for Health project, as well as contributions by other key partners.  
 
1.2 Context and Rationale  
 
In addition to the integrated technical capacity building support plan provided by USAID Communicate for  Health from 2015 –2019 discussed in the assessment report volume one , 
several  other initiatives occurred during the period supported by USAID Communicate for Health 
and various other partners and Ghana Health Service ( GHS ) itself. Going back to the contextual 
framework for the assessment , capacity building is described as “ interventions that strengthen 
an organization’s or individual’s ability to fulfil its mission by promoting sound management, 
strong gover nance and persistent rededication to achieving results. ” 
[Lammert et al. 2015 ]. It is 
recognized that performance to deliver does not depend only on technical capacity but also on favorable  enabling environment in terms of supportive policies, suitable physical infrastructure, 
financial access and requisite numbers of properly motivated staff.  It also includes ability to form 
productive relationships with groups outside itself and sell itself through rebranding.  Hence, t his 
chapter brings together information to answer the Terms of Reference ( ToR) question : 
 “Are there any unintended outcomes resulting from the implementation of the capacity building 
programs, and how have these complemented the intended outcomes? In addition, are there any unintended outcomes in HPDs capacity achieved over the life of the project that can be attributed to the capacity strengthening efforts of the Communicate for Health project? ” 
 
Attribution may be difficult to assign  but the following sections describe  various uninten ded 
outcomes of the USAID Communicate for Health project and mention contributions of all 
stakeholders as appropriate, with particular focus on contribution s by the USAID Communicate 
for Health.  
 
1.3 Health Information System (HIS) 
 If there is one area where much  progress has  been made fro m 2015– 2019, it is in  HIS, which 
includes the online data management system of GHS ( formerly called District Health Information  
Management 2 (DH IMS 2 ) but now labeled District Health Information System ( DHIS )). Over the 
years, despite  efforts, a systematic approach for collecting and analyzing health promotion -
related data and using it to improve programming and targeting for improved performance in 6 
 the midst of limited resources has been a challenge at all levels. The implications of such a gap 
are obvious as it affects proper monitoring of Health Promotion ( HP) activities, use of data for 
decision making, and appropriate targeting of resources and technical support.  
 Beginning in  June 2015, five  HPD officers and on e Family Health Division (F HD) officer worked 
with USAID Communicate for Health  and many other partners such as UNICEF, Policy Planning 
Monitoring and  Evaluation Division of GHS ( PPME ), Evaluate for H ealth , and Systems for H ealth  
to develop and implement a roadmap  for H IS, which includ ed: 
• Collation of all existing HP M&E tools  
• Development of a results framework based on HP Strategic Plan  
• Development of an indicator table detailing indicator definitions, levels of data 
disaggregation, sources of data collect ion, and methodology and frequency of data 
collection  
• Development of data collection tools and standard operation  procedures (SOPs) 
• Stakeholder engagement meetings to review and provide inputs into the process  
• Pretesting of tools  
• M&E workshop or “Boot Camp” to incorporate all reporting/summary forms into the 
then DHMIS2 
• Training of H eadquarters , regional, district , and frontline workers on tools and Standard 
Operation Procedures ( SOPs ). In total, 310 Technical Officers Health Promotion ( TOHP s) 
and District Health Information Officers (DHIOs ) from Ashanti, Brong Ahafo, Volta, 
Western, and Greater Accra Regions  were trained . UNICEF supported a national T raining 
of Trainers  for Regional HPOs and HIOs. For DHIOs, TOHPz  and sub -district staff, trainings 
were conducted in Upper East, Upper West, Northern, Eastern , and Central Regions. All 
10 regions have no w received the essential DHIS  training for DHIOs and TOHPs . 
 
To operationalize the HIS roadmap, the following M& E too ls were developed:   
• Volunteers register for health promotion activities  
• Health staff register for health promotion activities  
• Master register for regional trainings  
• Master register for district trainings  
• Monthly reporting form 
• Quarterly health promotion re porting form  
• Summary master registry for trainings  (regional level)  
• Standard Operation  Procedures (SOPs) for health promotion  
• District monitoring checklist  
• Regional monitoring checklist  
• Rapid assessment tool  
• Criteria for assessment of healthy HP distric ts [USAID Communicate for Health annual 
reports, 2015- 2019]  
 A total of 12,200 copies of Health Worke r Registers for HP were  printed by USAID Communicate 
for Health and distributed to all facilities in all the ten regions for use as the primary source of 7 
 data collection on health promotion activities  before entering them into the DHM IS2. Data 
collection using the Register for HP activities in all facilities began in August 2017. E ntry o f data 
into HP Data sets in to the then DH MIS2 was also activated in Sep tember 2017 for the Monthly 
Reporting Form for HP activities. The Monthly Reporting form is a summary of data collected 
from the primary data collection tool which is the Health Worker Register for HP activities.  The 
availability of the registers literally forced HPD and GHS to monitor Social Behavioral Change 
Communication  (SBCC ) and other HP activities.  
 
The following HP indicators were agreed on to be reported monthly through DHM IS2 by district 
and regional HP officers . [See Table  1 for examples of some  HP indicators in DHIS .]  
  
Table  1: Examples of  HP indicators in DHIS:  
• Number  of sessions held  
• Number  of times SBCC materials were used during HP activities  
• Number  of channels used  
• Number  of target audience reached

Figure 1 shows the reporting rate from the onset in August 2017 to Apr il–June 2019. There has 
been a percentage increase in reporting rate from 74% ( July–September ) 2017 to a high of 
98.25% (Jan uary –March  2018) and a dip to 92.8% (Oct ober –December  2018), a percentage 
increase of 18.8%.  The low reporting rate of 77.1% for Jan uary –March  2019 was due to non -
reporting from Ashanti region which was corrected in the second quarter.  8

 In terms of completeness of reporting, there has been a percentage increase of 23.4 % from 
57.8% in Aug 2017 to 81.2% in Jun 2019 (Fig. 2 ). Timeliness has also improved from 45% in Aug 
2017 to 74.5 % in Mar  2019, an increase of 29.5 % (Fig. 3 ). Despite the gradual improvements in 
completeness and timeliness of reporting, the rates are still below  85%.

 1.4 Monitoring and Evaluation Community of Practice (MECOP)  
 
MECOP, was an Evaluate for Health initiative that provided  opportunities  for USAID project staff 
including USAID Communicate for Health to build their technical capacity on monitoring and evaluation (M&E). These activities are organized usually on a quarterly basis  and provide a 
platform for capacity strengthening in a broad range of M&E topics, including peer learning among USAID partners. Although invitations for these trainings/activities are sent primarily to USAID partners, Communicate for Health has always ensured that as part of activities in capacity strengthening for evidence -based SBCC programming, staff from HPD and a project partner, Pro -
Link participate in these meetings. HPD participated in 18  of 22 MECOP activities conducted . 
MECOP thus provided another avenue for the M&E technical capacity building of HPD staff, an 
area that was found to be the weakest among all the SBCC elements assessed at baseline in 
2015. Table 2  outlines the topics covered during the MECOP training sessions over the peri od.

1.5 National SBCC Resource Center  
 National SBCC R esource Center  and 5 regional hubs have been established and made functional 
at the national leve l. The objective of the National SBCC Resource Center is to have a repository 
of all SBCC materials in one place and to place them onsite, and ultimately online, for research 11 
 and other purposes. Such a resource center  for SBCC is a necessity to support any techni cal 
capacity building to consolidate learning and  facilitate teaching and research. It also has the 
potential to attract many partners to the new Division.  This was financed by USAID Communicate 
for Health exclusively, including provision of technical support to train HPD officers and 
installation of required equipment at the na tional level and in five USAID focus regions -
Northern, Volta, Greater Accra, Central and Western . An information t echnology ( IT) technical 
officer contracted by USAID Communicate for Health work ed on the task full time, procuring all 
necessary equipment and software, and finalizing the design, customization, configuration, and 
test demonstrations of the E- Library software, ( DSpace ). 
 
A team from the Health Promotion Department and Communicate for Health Project carried out 
these trainings and orientations and at the end, two desktop computers and a printer were presented to each of the regions. These machines were installed , and health staff were trained 
on their use  
[USAID Communic ate for Health Annual Report  Y4]. 
 The national resource center includes a library, store room, exhibition and conference room . 
USAID Communicate for Health procured 5 computers and accessories for the onsite library. So far, 30 people have registered to a ccess the materials at the facility, and 120  SBCC materials 
have been uploaded and available for onsite downloading  [Appendix  1]. 
 During the field visit, however, it was learned that none of the regional hubs in the regions 
visited (Volta, GAR, Central Re gion and Western) had been  used  yet, and none were working 
either due to faulty UPS, faulty computer, or lack of internet access, although all were tested and working at the time of installation and training in the regions. Efforts are being made by the USAID Communicate for Health consultant to address these challenges and make them 
operational , and it is expected that they will be functional by the end of project as capacity has 
already been built at the regional level to operate the SBCC hubs . 
  
1.6 National Health SBCC  Technical Review Committee (SBCC -TRC) 
 
A National Health SBCC -TRC was established by D irector General  in December 2016 to ensure 
materials produced for Social and Behavior  Change campaigns are technically accurate and 
reflect current GHS policy and National Health Promotion Policy. USAID Communicate for Health worked behind the scenes for its establishment and has actively supported (including provision of technical support) and funded its operations since its inception , but HPD has now fully taken 
this on board as part of their mandate . Guidelines on material development 
[GHS 2019]  and 
standar d operation  procedure s for the Health  Sector SBCC -TRC have  been developed and 
finalized  to streamline its activities  (see appendix  2). The Committee is usually chaired by 
Director of FHD on behalf of DG, or in his absence, one senior officer is nominated to chair  with 
HPD serving as  the secretariat.  The committee is playing a very impor tant role in providing 
coordination, confidence , and consistency in content of SBCC materials. The committee also 
ensures that all SBCC materials that come out are of standard, technically sound  and culturally 
accurate. It thus provides leadership and visi on for harmonizing all educational materials and 12 
 also ensure that they conform to the existing GHS policies.  The review process affords officers of 
HPD to have regular hand -on practical experience of applying what they have learned in SBCC 
material develop ment.  
 
A number of SBCC materials developed by partners (print, audio , and audio -visuals) have been 
reviewed by the committee. The committee has so far approved 300 audios, 50 videos, and 70 
print SBCC materials from various partners on Water Sanitation and Hygiene (W ASH), nutrition, 
malaria, newborn care, breastfeeding, safe motherhood , and family planning by the committee  
as of August 1, 2019. Among partners that have used the SBCC –TRC to solicit feedback and 
approval for campaig ns and materials during the period include  JICA, GIZ, People for Health, 
JHPIEGO, PATH, WHO , Neglected Tropical Diseases ( NTDs ), National Malaria Control Programme 
and Afro Star.  
 A comment by a partner is provided below as an example of the trust that is building between partne rs and the committee.  
 “This is a very helpful service. Through this structure, stakeholders get direct feedback on their 
production work so that at the end of the day , messages are accurate, up -to-date , and support 
the GHS’s needs. SOPs need to be finalized and circulated so that stakeholders understand the purpose of the National SBCC -TRC and what they can expect as services. HPD needs to be careful 
that they do not make going through the SBCC -TRC a burden for small NGOs (i.e. , insisting on 
lunch, snacks , and travel and  transportation ). Right now, some people are brought in from the 
regions f or these meetings. ”  
 
1.7 Inter -agency Coordinating Committee ( ICC-HP) 
 ICC-HP is an inter -agency coordinating body aimed at bringing together stakeholders in health 
promotion and agencies involved in health for a common goal of ensuring people are healthy. It functions in an advisory capacity to achieve the goal of National Health Promotion Strategy and 
its core objective s are to mobilize, harness,  and make effective use of stakeholder resources in 
implementing health promotion activities . In 2015 , a process began to prepare for re -launch of 
the ICC -HP during first quarter of 2016. The processes included re -development of the TOR for 
the ICC -HP at national and later regional levels, identification of an experienced media person as 
chairperson, and selection of stakeholders to form the ICC -HP. About 20 different organizations  
(private, public, development partners, academia, non -governmental organizations ( NGOs ), 
community leaders) were brought together to form the refreshed ICC -HP. 
 The main achievements are conducting quarterly multi -sector meetings to provide oversight 
guidance for HP in Ghana, strengthening of Region al ICC -HP in three  USAID Communicate for 
Health  focus regions (V olta, G reater Accra  and Western), and establishment of a resource 
mobilization sub -committee with ToR.  
 Establishment of the Northern Region USAID Implementing Partners (IPs) SBCC Coordination Committee  13 
  
This committee is an initiative of the USAID Communicate for Health project. It was initiated  in 
2015 at the request of USAID for USAID Communicate for Health to coordinate SBCC 
investments in the region. It began  with USAID Implementing Partners (I Ps) but expanded to 
include other SBCC players in the region with profound  results. Although started by USAID 
Communicate for Health,  it was coordinated and driven by the Regional Health Promotion 
Officer and Deputy Director Public Health . The committee  met quarterly to share b est practices 
in health promotion  among  staff from USAID Communicate for Health and HPD at the national 
level , even though it was more hands -on work between partners based in the Northern r egion . 
This activity has helped to raise the profile and visibility of Health Promotion  in the region.  
 
1.8 Financial Resources and Mobilization  
 
One recurring constraint over the years is lack of funding for HP activities. Funding from 
government of Ghana, apart from for salaries, has been very minimal. Consequently, HPD  has 
had to depend on donor funding for the most  basic needs. The total 5 -year USAID Communicate 
for Health project budget to support mass media campaigns, capacity building, and various 
health promotion activities at the national level and  five USAID focu s regions  was almost USD 18 
million . In terms of ER #2, however, a total of about GHC 2,438,749.42 (about USD 468 ,990) of 
direct funding has been spent as at the time of the assessment in July 2019 [see Table 3 ]. The 
funding support excludes other indirect support to HPD by USAID Communicate for Health (see 
Appendix  3). 
 
A number of other partners, notably UNICEF and PATH, have also provided financial support to HPD over  the period as shown in Table 3.

 The two main funding channels are the Fixed Amounts Award (FAA) and the In -Kind Grant (IKG) 
mechanism. IKG is used by USAID Communicate for Health  for procurement of goods and 
services on behalf of HPD. FAA arrangement involved HPD writing effective PDs based on its own 
identified priorities and executing the approved activities based on a fixed budget with agreed deliverables  or deliverables . There have been three FAAs.  The first (t otal GHS 292,874 [about 
USD 56,322]) was to provide  logistical support to the HPD to jointly co -create, refresh , and 
launch the GoodLife  brand and campaign . Additionally, and carry out many of the activities 
indicated in the Health Promotion Policy including holding stakeholder meetings for the 
elevation of HP to a division, quarterly SBCC ICC-HP meetings at the national level and the 
regions, monitoring and supervision of HP activities in the region, national assessments of HP’s 
strengths and weaknesses, and integration of HPD indicators into DHIS  etc.  
 The second  is the Performance Based Change Challenge Fund (CCF) awards (Total GHS107,595  
[USD 20,691.34]) to graduates of the Change Agent Development Program and SfC Action 
Learning Sets to access up to GHC 6,000 [about USD 1,154] each to conceive, design , and 
implement a priority SBCC campaign approved by the districts where they live and work. Currently , 15 CCF beneficiaries are funded under the CCF fixed award and have implemented  
SBCC projects ranging from maternal, child, adolescent health, nutrition , and WASH.  
 USAID Communicate for Health  has approval to relea se a third  FAA (Total GHc  637,950  [about 
USD 122,683 ]) for the implementation of the Community Engagement for Malaria Prevention 
(CE4MP) initiative in the Volta region. The CE4MP project will reinforce USAID Communicate for 
Health’s above -the-line SBCC activities by GHS/HPD. The GHS/HPD officers at the district and 
community leve ls will be engaging communities to design and implement tailored malaria 
Community Action Plans (mCAP) with local lead ers and health workers based on the realities of 
the areas where they live and work. The initiative will mobilize  communities across 95 functional 
Community- Based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) zones in seven out of the twenty -five 
districts in the Vo lta region, which will implement a range of advocacy, community mobilization, 
and behavior change communication initiatives. The period of performance for this Fixed Amount Award (FAA) was  July 8 –September 30, 2019 and is managed and coordinated  from 
HPD/F HD of GHS in Accra . 
 The inception meeting was held  in Ho on April 24 , 2019 to introduce stakeholders at the regional 
and district levels to the CE4MP initiative. Following the inception meeting, the tools and guidelines for the implementation of the CE4MP  initiative were  finalised. There is ongoing 
engagement with HPD to finalize print materials, develop a work plan with timelines, collect 
baseline data on malaria indicators from the beneficiary districts , and engage a vendor to 
translate the Maternal Health Channel episodes on malaria into Ewe for showing in communities 
as part of the planned activities for the initiative. The Maternal Health Channel is an educational and entertaining t elevision  series developed by the project with Creative Storm Networks.  
 
1.9 Policy and Legal Framework  
 15 
 The implementation of the HPD USAID Communicate for Health collaboration was guided by a 
number of policy and strategic guidelines, including:  
 
• HS/USAID MOU on  Communicate for Health  
This Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) provides the broad framework for collaboration between the Parties with regard to the goals, targets, benefits, expectations and requirements for cooperation and partnership in mutually benefic ial 
areas of interest. This agreement took effect from January 31, 2017 and is expected to 
expire on November 30, 2019. The MOU also provides principles and values guiding the 
partnership,  roles and responsibilities of the parties, communications with exte rnal 
parties, as well as conflict resolution  mechanism [

2019, together with its implementation plan, was developed during the period to guide strategic direction for HPD activities, including technic al capacity building. The Plan also 
provided guidance for other partners to buy into  and support other  aspects of HPD 
programs. Though started independently by HPD, USAID Communicate for Health supported HPD financially to finalize and print the National HP Strategic Plan 2015 -2019 
and Health Promotion Policy 2013.

1.10 Human Resource  
 For the first time , clear job descriptions for all categories of HPD officers have been developed -
an unintended outcome which resulted from the capacity building programs of USAID Communicate for Health. The process was begun before the project,  but the project facilitated 
the process through financial and technical support to HRDD and HPD of GHS. The GHS Council has officially approved the job descriptions for various categories of HP officers. This has improved job placement , clarified  the promotion process, and enabled GHS to put HPD officers 
in the  appropriate salary scales at par with their counter parts in other professional categories. 
Now there is a clear career path and progression for Health Promotion within the service , an 
achievement that has boosted the morale of the HP officers.  
 16 
 As part of the process for develop ing the job descriptions , GHS Human Resource Division (HRD) 
organiz ed a workshop for 34 Health Promotion staff from national and regional levels at Dodowa 
from June 11 –13, 2017. J ob descriptions addressed included  various categories of HP officers , 
from Health Educator (Health Promo tion Manager)  through Senior Health Educator (Senior 
Health Promotion Manager), Principal Health Educator (Health Promotion Manager), Deputy 
Chief Health Educator (Deputy Chief Health Promotion Manager), t o Chief Health Educator.  
 A similar exercise was done for the technical officer grade from Technical Officer, Health 
Promotion to Chief Technical O fficer HP. The job description consists of different components: 
Job Title, Grade, Responsible To, Job Purpose, Main Duties and Responsibilities, Communication 
and Working Relationships; Personal and People Development; Health a nd Safety 
Responsibilities; Quality Assuranc e; and Person Specification.  
  
1.11 Equipment and Infrastructure  
 
In addition to direct funding support to HPD, USAID Communicate for Health  supported HPD 
through  equipment donations and an IKG during the period  (see appendix 3  full list) . The 
provision of  these equipment and facilities provided the conducive  environment that enabled 
HPD to improve upon its capacity and deliver on its mandate.  
 
1. USAID Communicate for Health delivered two used Ford Explorer v ehicles , inherited from 
a previous USAID project , and rehabilitated three old HPD vehicles. Besides routine 
maintenance , the project also procured tires  for these vehicles. The project also donated 
a server for setting up the National SBCC R esource Center  and restored i nternet to the 
entire HPD building following its refurbishment in 2016. The project also procured furniture for the Head of Health Promotion and his deputy and some other national level staff.  
2. The project renovated  the old HPD headquarters building and equipped  it with furniture, 
internet connectivity , air conditioners , and other social amenities  to create a conducive 
working environment for staff. This has made the operationalization  of the co -location 
component  of the CBS P possible . Two conference rooms have been made available for 
internal and external use for workshops, meetings , and conferences to facilitate capacity 
building. The project was financed solely by USAID Communicate for Health  and these  
facilities have provided an avenue for internally gen erated funds for HPD.  
3. A number of desk top computers were provided to the Head of HPD and other officers, as well as photocopier and printers.   
4. The National SBCC R esource Center was equipped with new personal computers ( PCs). 
5. The Social Media office was resourced with 5 PCs, 2 IPad s and an IPhone  X. 
 
1.12 Elevation of HPD to Divisional Status  
 One fruit of the advoca cy initiative of the USAID Communicate for Health was the elevation of 
HPD from a d epartment under F amily Health Division  to a separate Division under the Director 17 
 General. The GHS Council  funded a consultancy aimed at giving Health Promotion the desired 
status in healthcare delivery within the Ghana Health Service. The HPD benefited from this  
elevation to Divisional status by being reposition ed and rebrand ed, with the objective of 
developing an institutional vision and brand identity for HPD to  increase its level of influence.  A 
consultant was engaged by USAID Communicate for Health to work with the HPD on achieving 
this goal by working with staff to assess professional values, beliefs , and culture , and  increas e the 
profile and visibility of HPD, as well as improve its methods of working with other sectors within 
the Ghana Health Service, partners , and stakeholders.  The process included finalizing the Health 
Promotion Policy 2013 and the National Strategy and Action Plan for Health Promotion 2015 –
2019  for formal adoption  and subsequent launching of these documents .  
 The consultants  engaged by GHS Council held in -depth and  interactive discussions with several 
stakeholders including the Director of the Family Health Division, staff of the hitherto Health Promotion Department, Director and staff of the Human Resource Development Division of the GHS, the Director -General and members of the 5
th Ghana Health Service Council, culminating in 
a report to the GHS council and an aid memoire by the Joint Donor Partner Community endor sing the elevation of HPD to a D ivision .  
 The report to the GHS Council from the c onsultant s covered th e following:  
• Finalized mission/vision statement and functions to be performed by the new division.  
• Finalized organogram, detailing core responsibilities and specific job description for all 
categories of staff under the proposed structure at all levels (national, regional, district, 
sub-district  and CHPS) [ appendix  5]. This activity was supported also by USAID 
Communicate for Health.  
• Finalized human resource staffing norms for the new division. T he development of the 
job description that facilitated the development of staffing norms was funded and 
technically supported by USAID Communicate for Health.  
• Plan for recruitment of staff developed in conjunction with GHS Human Resource Division to occupy key positions.  
• Finalized total budgetary requirement (Human  Resource and others) for the 
establishment of the new division.  
• Finalized draft implementation plan for the establishment of the new division .       
 The new Health Promotion division is to be headed by a Divisional Director with three Deputy Directors proposed for three (3) key technical departments and a secretariat for the Office of the Director of the Division. The proposed key technical departments include  
• Health Communication  
• Advocacy and Social Mobilization  
• Research and Healthy Policy  
 Provi sion has also been made for Units under the respective technical departments , and their 
functions described . [see appendix 5  for organogram for division ].  
 
1.13 Curriculum Review  18 
 The training curriculum of Kint ampo College of Health and Wellbeing for the training of TOHP 
has been revised with funding and technical support from USAID Communicate for Health and 
HPD, in line  with the National HP Policy and Strategy. This will offer the opportunity for pre -
service training of HP technical officers in SBCC before they are deployed to the districts. The review included  enhancing the SBCC component of the old syllabus.   
   19 
  
CHAPTER 2: CHALLENGES/GAPS 
 
Despite the impressive achievements over the past 5 years  of the project, several  weaknesses , 
gaps  and challenges have been identified within the enabling environment for capacity building 
during the assessment which have to be addressed going forward.  These are based on my own 
analysis of the various interviews from all stakeholders and my own inside knowledge of what has happened between 2015 and 2019 as far as HPD is concerned Recommendations for address ing these gaps are provided in Chapter 3.  
 
2.1 SBCC Technical Review Process  
 The c urrent SBCC t echnical review process is too cumbersome , time consu ming , and needs to be 
made more efficient , in spite  of a SoP recently developed by HPD and USAID Communicate for 
Health officers. The concern  is due to the fact that donor -funded projects are time sensitive,  and 
any delays may lead to pressure. At times, it has been difficult to assemble members of the SBCC 
TRC to perform its assignment due to various administrative and operational challenges, resulting in delayed  meeting timelines. Operational challenges include not providing enough 
notice to members on meeting days, and delayed sharing of draft materials which have to be reviewed before the meeting. There isn’t usually enough time to thoroughly review materials especially multiple  materials. The committee membership, especially from HPD, is also too large , 
making it unwieldy and lead ing to delays in decision making.  
 Furthermore , some partners often want to circumvent key steps of the SBCC TRC’s SOP, such as  
providing concept paper before materials are developed , with the excuse of limited funding and 
time  pressure . Another challenge is that a few partners have their own brand ; as such , they are 
not comfortable with the policy of using the GHS ’ GoodLife  brand . 
 
2.2 Health Information System  
 The greatest weakness in Health Information System is lack of regular quarterly and half 
year/annual meeting of HP staff, especially at national level, to analyze  HP indicators and provide 
feedback on performance to influence strategy.  
 Though the reporting rate of HP indicators through DHIS has improved (over 92% as at June 2019), the quality of data reported is suspect.  Timeliness and completeness are still low  (never 
reached 85 %), as not all districts are reporting on  time and completely as required.  There are 
also some fluctuations in reporting rates due to poor performance by some regions. This is where data can be used as feedback and for monitoring, but this is hardly done at the national 
level.  
 20 
 The current set of HP indicators is too focused on activities carried out rather than outputs and 
outcome s. In addition, there are currently no targets set for HP to measure performance or link 
outcome or achievements to interventions.  
 
2.3 National SBCC Resource Cent er 
 Not many people are aware of or utilizing the National SBCC Resource Ce nter for SBCC research. 
Currently, only about 30 people have regist ered onsite to use the facility. During the assessment, 
the regional hubs were found to  be malfunctioning due to minor operational and equipment 
challenges , even though  the equipment had been tested and was functional during the regional 
training s. Fortunately, the IT expert has been addressing these challenges to make them fully 
functional .     
 
2.4 ICC-HP 
 The ICC -HP, like most of other initiatives, is too donor dependent and suffers from fund ing 
challenges . Initially, it was supported through an IKG and later through FAA  with USAID 
Communicate for Health . A few challenges resulted in infrequent meetings due to inadequate 
liquidation of funds by HPD, as well as failure to mobilize  additional fu nding from other partners 
to support the meetings . ICC-HP could not mobilize additional resources to support HP activities, 
even though a resource mobilization sub -committee was set up with a defined ToR.  Currently, 
the committee has not been able to meet for over eight months due to funding challenges.  
 
2.5 Leadership and  Governance  
 In spite of new job description s having  been developed for all categories of HPD staff, the delay 
in moving from department to divisional status due to delayed appointment of key managers has left a big vacuum at the national level in terms of who leads the new division . Most of the 
officers are unsure of their standing as far as proposed division departments and units are 
concerned. The exit of th e former head of HPD who has gone on compulsory retirement has 
worsened the vacuum created by the  delay in appointing a director and deputy directors for the 
new division  by the Public Service Commission . Currently, there is a major threat in maintaining 
the capacity building gains chalked over the period due to lack of leadership to guide the process 
moving forward.  
 Too many internal “ clashes ” and squabbles among some officers of HPD at the beginning of the 
USAID Communicate for Health project  led to ten se working relationships, which spilled over to 
affect relationship with partners . The situation can be attributed to different business culture  
(public vs. private) , different expectations, confusion over roles , and different interpretations  of 
responsibi lities  by key stakeholders  about the nature and design of the USAID Communicate for 
Health project. Be as it may, its effect cannot be downplayed  in a co- location environment,  as it 
led to suspicions and  mistrust, and p recious time was spent  on conflict resolution , which 
resulted in  delays in implementation  at the initial stages .  21 
  
Some senior staff appear to be more committed to programs and projects outside the HPD than department- relate d projects , hence, their contribution to the overall s uccess of the department 
was sub -optimal. This has created a situation where a few technical staff are currently burdened 
with the ever -increasing work load due to improved technical capacity. Most of the experienced 
officers are aging  and exiting, leaving  younger , less experienced officers. This is a major challenge 
which has to be addressed soon.  Furthermore, e ven though HPD meets regularly , there is no 
opportunity to critique each other, a key ingredient for excellence , due to fear of offending each 
othe r. Currently, there appears to be l ack of innovators  at HPD . Someone stated, “There are 
certain people at HPD who are tired and have lost their passion.”   
2.6 Financial Management and Resource Mobilization  
 Despite the additional funds it has attracted ov er the period , HPD is still under -resourced and 
too donor -dependent, a situation which is not sustainable.  HPD finds the procurement system of 
USAID Communicate for Health too cumbersome , leading to delayed implementation of 
activities.  However, d elayed reporting, liquidation , and documentation by HPD , especially of 
funding through FAA, resulted in  delayed release of funds.  
 
2.7 Opportunities  
 During the assessment,  a number of opportunities were identified for HPD  moving forward. 
These may not be direct ly related to the USAID Communicate for Health project support, but the 
intention of any such support is to enhance technical performance beyond the lifespan of the 
project . A few of these opportunities are briefly outlined below . 
  
1. The Sustainable Development Goals has led to i ncreas ed interest in health promotion by  the 
global society. HPD should be able to build upon  the clout of GHS to develop winnable 
proposals from multiple sources.  It is important for HPD to make a difference now that it has 
been elevated to division.  With its new status as a Division, HPD should be able to garner 
national support within the health system and with other actors outside GHS to realize 
health for all according to the Ottawa Ch arter.
1 
2. Another opportunity is for HPD to become the SBCC hub , by continuing to build on its ability 
to deliver , which will  increasingly attract additional funding and partners for collaborative 
actions .  The Materials Development Unit should be the engine  of HP to generate its own 
resources  (internally generated funds) from both internal and external actors in the SBCC 
space  to support some of its activities . 
3. Within GHS, there is opportunity to attract c ommunication activities previously being carried 
out by other departments and units f or coordination and execution  by HPD , as the other 
programs  recognize the technical capacity of HPD to deliver.  Already a number of programs

Ottawa 1986  
 22 
 of GHS such as NTDs, Malaria and EPI ar e partnering with  HPD to deliver on S BCC 
components of their programs . 
4. A number of private , for profit institutions are engaged in projects which include SBCC as 
part of cooperat ive social responsibilities. There is a n opportunity here for HPD to position 
itself properly t o benefit from such initiatives through public -private partnerships.  
5. There is currently an i ncreasing number of community radio/ t elevision  outlets  and print 
media with capacity to accommodate multiple languages and this  offers another opportunity 
for HP  Division to deliver on its mandate  moving forward .  
6. Furthermore , there is a g rowing I T infrastructure  and social media networks  that have 
enormous potential to reach wider audiences at minimal cost, and these areas offer major 
opportunities for HP Division moving forward.  
 
2.8 Threats to HPD 
 A few internal and external threats to HPD were also identified which have to be addressed moving forward.  
 
1. As technical capacity of HPD officers improve , there is increasing threat of key officers 
moving to private or international organizations  for better remuneration.  
2. The l eadership vacuum created , due to delayed appointments of substantive senior 
managers to run the D ivision , is a major threat to performance . Weak leadership that is 
unable to change mentality of current staff at HPD to play expected roles of a new Division 
will result in ‘work as usual’ attitude.  
3. All departments and units of GHS are practicing health education and they consider this as Health Promotion , so if measures and systems are not well defined, it will affe ct the  
performance of the Division.  
4. In the midst of dwindling resources, emergency situations such as outbr eaks and natural 
disasters may distract partners from supporting regular health development activities , 
including SBCC . 
 
 
 23 
 CHAPTER 3:  ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS  
 
Based on the interviews, findings, observations and analysis of all that has happened to HPD from 2015 to 2019, the following additional recommendations  are made , focusing on the 
enabling capacity building environment, to enhance performance of the new HP Division moving forward.  
 
Leadership and Governance  
 
1. As soon as possible, GHS Council should appoint a strong Director with advocacy skills 
to provide strategic leadership for the Health Promotion Division . The new Director  
should have  the capacity to bring all staff together for the common good of the 
Division as per its mandate  and mobilize  enough resources for the Division . All the 
vacant positions, especially the three Deputy Directors, should be filled to avoid creating a gap in  the proper functioning of the new Division. The Director should build 
a core team of innovators who are willing to build a creative culture and generate ideas and concepts for innovations  for the new Division.   
2. Review the staffing needs of the Division and make  urgent effort to fill critical  gaps . It 
is particularly important to embed digital technology into work of HPD to cover all 
interventions , in the light of new IT infrastructure and expanding roles of the Division.  
3. There may be the need to establish a digital communication unit  with a dedicated 
hotline as part of SBCC effort.  Strengthen the social media program by providing 
needed logistical and financial support, including engaging a video editor.  
4. Immediately after their appointment, t he new leaders should  take steps to review the 
current HP Strategic Plan (which ends in December 2019) and develop a new one for 
2020– 2024. T he plan should include strategies to address the current work ethic to 
avoid  a “business as usual ” mentality by incorporating lessons le arned from the 
private sector during the various internship projects to enhance performance.   
5. Market HPD to make it attractive to interested stakeholders by outlining  
achievements of the Division over the past 5 years and its future capabilities. The new 
Strategic Plan (2020– 2024) should include an advocacy and marketing plan to 
enhance its visibility and sell its capabilities to the general public and partners . The 
social media unit should use its various platforms as part of the marketing strategy to 
market the Division and its capabilities.  
6. Streamline the review process of  the Health Service  SBCC Technical Review 
Committee for existing and new SBCC messages to make communication  more 
efficient.   
 
Partnership  
 
1. Make every effort to sustain ICC -HP committee meetings by making it less donor -
driven and dependent. Its activities should be made part of the new  Division budget 24 
 so that partners can support funding of its activities rather than the Division being 
entirel y dependent on them.   
2. The rec ently formed mobilization  sub-committee of ICC -HP s hould be reactivated and 
charged by ICC -HP with  operationalizing  the ToR which has been developed to guide 
its functioning.  
 
Resource Mobilization  
 
HPD should develop a resource mobilization plan and enhance its technical capacity in proposal writing to attract funding. This area is still weak, and HPD  may need a fund -
raiser to support its resource mobilization effort with specified deliverables.  
 
Health Information Syste m 
 
1. Review the current HP indicators from activities to include output and outcome measures 
as appropriate and develop targets to measure performance . Examples of such indicators 
include:  
• Percentage of clients satisfied with health promotion services    
• Proportion of Health Promotion Officers receiving Continuous Professional 
Development (CPD)  
• Percentage of districts designated as “healthy” as per the national best health promoting district award criteria  
• Percentage of community members practicing  desired he alth behaviors  
• Number of target audience reached with SBCC activities  
                   
2. Address the current weak data management system by establishing systems for regular analysis and use of HP Indicators in DHIS at all levels, especially at national lev el. 
 
Strengthen the National SBCC Resource Cent er 
 
Strengthen SBCC Resource C enter. E xtend the regional hub to all regions and make it  
functional  to provide available information required by interested stakeholders and  facilitate 
the SBCC review process  and HP research . Publicize  the SBCC Resource Cent er to all 
interested stakeholders for wider access.

Appendix 2 : Standard Operation Procedures (SOP) for National SBCC Technical 
Review committee  
 
Introduction  
Development of social and behavior change communication materials is important to the MoH/Ghana Health Service and all health partners. To ensure materials produced for Social and Behavior  Change Communication are technically accurate and reflect current M oH/GHS policies 
and programs , a National SBCC Technical Review Committee (herein referred to as “the 
Committee”) has been established.    To ensure quality work is undertaken by the committee, there is the need for a standard protocol to guide the work of this technical committee. Hence this Standard Operation  30 
 Procedure (SOP) has been developed for responsive, efficient, effective functioning and 
coordination of the SBCC Technical Review Committee’s work.  
 
Operational Definition of SBCC Materials : For the purpose of this SOP, SBCC materials include but 
not limited to audio, audio- visual, multimedia infomercials/spots, social media, and print 
(posters, drama, flipcharts, counselling cards, job aids , etc.). 
 
Committee Functions: The committee shall:  
• Streamline, review and approve the content of SBCC materials  
• Ensure approved materials are in line with current MoH/GHS policies  and programs   
• Serve as a clearing house for all SBCC materials  
• Raise awareness on the work of the committee and what is required for  the approval of 
SBCC materials  
 
Core Membership : The membership of the committee shall comprise :  
• Director General GHS (Chair)  
• Directors of HPD, PHD, ICD and FHD  
• Deputy Director responsible for Health Communication (Coordinator) and shall perform 
secretar ial support to the committee and the two other deputy directors of HPD  
• Representative of MoH  
• Deputy director/programme manager of subject areas to be reviewed (co -opted 
members)  
• Three representatives of communication health partners , e.g., WHO, UNICEF, USAID, 
JICA, UNFPA  
• Representative of academia  
• Representative of Coalition of NGOs in Health  
• Representative of FDA  
*The committee may co- opt any other agency/person depending on the material to be reviewed 
as and when necessary.  
 
Procedure : The following steps shall apply to the development, technical review, approval , and 
clearance of SBCC materials presented to the Committee:  
1) Consumer dipstick/desktop review/analysis  
2) Concept design (Committee review/approval)  
3) Concept pre-testing  
4) Development  of draft materials (Committee review)  
5) Pre-testing of revised draft materials   
6) Final approval of materials (Committee approval)  
 
The Committee shall be involved in  three of the six steps ( 2, 4, and 6 ) listed for all approval and 
clearance processes. The steps include approval of design concepts including creative briefs, approval of rough cuts or draft materials, and providing clearance for final products.  
 31 
 1. Consumer dipstick/desktop review/analysis : This stage involves provision of evidence and 
ration ale for the generation of the concept of the SBCC material. The role of the committee is to 
ensure that there is a basis for the generation of the content.   
 
2. Concept Design : This stage involves review of proposed draft concepts: rough cuts, scripts, 
story board, image holders, messages, mock- ups etc. The vendor shall submit the draft of a 
concept design to the Secretariat of the Committee.  
 
The Deputy Director  
Health Communication shall constitute and convene the relevant technical sub -committee to 
review the draft concept, which shall comprise the head of the relevant subject area, technical 
officers , and representatives of the HP communication. The technical sub -committee of the 
relevant subject area shall review the concept developed and make recommendations to the 
Committee for approval.  
 The Te chnical Sub -Committee must ensure:  
• Proposed concepts and messages meet both technical programme and communication 
objectives.  
• Suggested materials address the barriers to change and are technically accurate and in 
line with current health policy documents including the GoodLife Brand Manual. . 
• Concept designs received are reviewed and submitted to the Committee within five (5) days, and three (3) days under exceptional situations.   
• The secretariat shall circulate reviewed materials and recommendations to Committee members at least 5 days prior to a meeting.  
 Composition of the technical sub -committee  
• Head of the relevant subject area  
• Other programme officers of the subject area  
• Representatives of the Health Promotion Communication Department  
• Any other coopted member from a relevant agency/pa rtner  
 The Committee will not review any materials that have not been recommended by the received approval from the technical sub -committee.  
 
3. Pre -Testing of Draft Concepts:  Following approval of design concepts by the committee, pre -
testing of the concepts must be conducted immediately to ensure cultural relevance and appropriateness, comprehension and acceptability from the target audience. Pretesting should follow approved standard pretesting guidelines and protocols (Accessible at the Committee’s Secr etariat).  
  
Pretest reports of draft concepts shall be shared with the relevant Technical Sub -Committee and 
implementing partners for review and inputs after which pretested concepts should be 
transformed into rough cuts/draft materials.  Target period: 3 weeks  32 
  
4. Development of draft materials  (Committee review) : Stage 4 involves the translation of the 
reviewed and pretested concepts into the appropriate materials. The Vendor shall submit the 
pretested reports and the draft materials through the secretariat to the Committee for review within 3 weeks.   
 
5. Pre -testing of draft materials : This  shall be required if major changes are made by the 
Committee; otherwise the minor corrections shall be inputted into the draft material without a 
second pretesting.  
 
6. Final approval of materials : After changes have been implemented on Draft material by 
HPD/Vendor/Agency , it shall be presented to the Committee for final approval and clearance.   
Approval of  all materials shall be obtained when the Committee passes them for mass 
production. All finalized SBCC materials shall be shared with the National Health Promotion Resource Center  for documentation.  
 
Branding of materials : All materials approved by the Committee shall conform to Ghana Health 
Service standards and branding (GoodLife Brand manual).    
 
• Materials for use on the GoodLife social media platforms shall conform to the GoodLife 
Brand Manual.  
 
Disclaimer : A disclaimer shall be boldly placed on all materials approved by the Committee.  
The Committee shall not be held responsible for any material that does not bear its seal.  
 
Appendix  
Criteria for clearance/approval  An SBCC material cleared should have the following elements:  
1. Create a distinct look and personality — Effective SBCC mater ials are vivid, having an 
appealing personality that helps them stand out from other materials. They should stimulate the target audience with a distinctive look, sound, making them stand out from 
the "clutter" of competing materials and messages. Messages  and design all must speak 
with the same voice — in design, color, text and narrative  
2. Clarify the Message : Ensure the message is clear and easily understood.  
3.  Stress the most compelling key benefit . SBCC materials should address real needs and 
problems facing the target audience. The information they provide should be specific and 
single –minded. The main message and benefit to the target population should be clear.  
4. Consistency Counts:  Repeat the same message consistently to avoid confusion and 
enhance the impact of the message. Ensure key messages form the core of what goes into the different mediums.  
5. Generate trust.  Without trust and credibility, the message will go unheeded. SBCC 
materials that are simple, direct, and technically correct generate trust in what they say. Trust is generated by source, tone, presentation, believable images, and a solid information foun dation.  33 
 6. Appeal to both the heart and the head.  A decision on the part of the target audience to 
try something new is not made entirely in the mind — trials are often decided in part by 
an emotional response. Thus, effective SBCC materials and messages shou ld be designed 
to appeal to both the heart or emotions, and the head or reason.  
7. Call to Action : SBCC materials should include a clear call to action.  Target audience 
should be told precisely what they should do.  
Target: 1 week.

 Appendix 4. Draft Standard Operation Procedures (SOP) for National Resource e -
Library  
 
Purpose  
The pu rpose of these Standard Operation  Procedures is to provide guidelines and procedures for 
the archiving, retrieval, use of, adoption, modification , and adaptation of materials house d at the 
National SBCC Digital Library and Resource Center  and the regional hubs. It also describes the 
rights, duties and responsibilities of users and managers of the Digital Library and Repository at 
the national and regional level, as well as procedures for obtaining authorization for uploads of materials.  
 
Background  
Over the years, t he Ghana Health Service has produced a range of technically sound and diverse 
health communication materials, tool kits, documentaries, and audio/video programs with suppo rt from a wide variety of partners and organizations (USAID, UNICEF, UNFPA, WHO, JICA, 
DFID and others). Unfortunately, many of these materials have been scattered all over the place, 
poorly catalog ued, and a number are missing or damaged. This has made  it difficult for 
academicians, researchers, students , and social and behavior  change communication 
practitioners to have a one -stop repository for easy retrieval of SBCC materials. In 2016, the 
USAID Communicate for Health project supported the Ghana Health Service to create the National SBCC Resource Center  at the office of the Health Promotion Department at Korle Bu, 
with hubs in the Greater Accra, Central, Western, Northern , and Volta Regions.  
 
The National SBCC Digital Library and Resource Center  is an on -line platform that will house a 
broad range of selected technically sound, high quality SBCC materials produced in Ghana. The Resource Center  is linked to the Health COMpass, GHS website and GHS/GoodLife social media 
platforms. A list of other SBCC resource sites will be provided at the Resource Center  for the 
benefit of interested clients. 
  
 
Management of the National SBCC and Regional Resource Centers   
The National Digital Library and Resource Center  will be managed by a team of three technical  
people: a Resource Center  Manager, an Information Technology Specialist and an SBCC or 
Materials Development Officer under the proposed Communication Department of a Health Promotion Division of Ghana Health Service. These officers shall jointly be responsible for cataloging approved materials (SBCC materials, toolkits and other health communication materials) and uploading same  onto the repository of the National SBCC Digital and Resource Center . They will also provide access to onsite and online users including academicians, students, 
researchers and SBCC practitioners. Regional Health Promotion Officers shall manage the regional hubs which shall be connected to the National Center  through a Virtual Private Network 
(VPN). Management of the Center  and Regional Hubs are responsible for resolving all issues that 
may arise from the use of the facilities.  
 36 
 All persons needing to use the facilities shall register online , and only registered clients shall be 
given access by the Manager of the Resource Center . A register of users/clients shall be 
maintained at the Center  and regional hubs for capturing data of all clients who use the facilities 
on site. The data shall also be automatically captured for all users who log onto the repository 
anytime online.  
 Manage ment shall provide code of ethics for the guidance of all clients, and this shall be 
prominently displayed onsite and be available as part of registration process.  
 
Target Audience  
These guidelines are designed for use by individuals who will be managing t he National SBCC 
Digital Library and Resource Center , staff of the regional resource center  hubs and other clients 
who will be using the platform. It also includes staff of Health Promotion, in particular, and GHS in general.   
 
Guidelines/Criteria for sel ecting materials for the National Resource Center :  
• All materials for the SBCC Digital Library and Resource Center  must be presented to and 
approved by the Health Sector SBCC Technical Review Committee before they can be accepted by the Resource Center .  
• The manager of the National SBCC Resource Center  shall be the official administrator of 
the Digital Library and repository.  
• The management of the Center  shall establish a system for coding all approved materials.  
• All materials shall be digitized as appropriate before uploading on to the Repository.  
• Uploading of approved materials by the Health Sector SBCC -TRC shall be done only at the 
national level.  
• Materials that are later found to be defective shall be tagged as such but left for research 
purpose s. 
 
Rights and Responsibilities of Clients  
 SBCC practitioners, Health Promotion Technical Officers, academicians, researchers, and 
students can access materials from the repository for their use after registration.  
 Reproduction of the materials without further modification or adaptation is permitted.  
 The responsibility of the client is to ensure the optimal use of the equipment; in the event of damage to any equipment, this must be reported to the manager of the center . 
 Materials downloaded from the Repository are not to be used for commercial purposes  
 
Care, Maintenance and Running Of The Center  
The Health Promotion Department shall be responsible for the care, maintenance and running of the Center  at the National level. The Regional Directorate of Health  Service shall be responsible 
for the care, maintenance and running of the regional hub. It is the responsibility of the Health Promotion Department and Regional Health Directorates to mobilize resources for the upkeep of the National Center  and regional h ubs. Regular planned preventive maintenance shall be 
performed , preferably on a quarterly basis.  37

 Exec utive  Summary  
Background  
The five-year cooperative agreement awarded to FHI 360 (prime) and its consortium of partners, 
Creative Storm Networks, Ghana Community Ra dio Network  and Viamo1 sought to improve the health 
and well -being of Ghanaians through a broad range of “above the line” mass media communication 
campaigns. The project supported the Ghana Health Service  (GHS) to increase demand for and use of 
key health services through sustained evidence -based social and behavior change communication (SBCC) 
and adoption of positive health behaviors across family planning (FP); maternal, newborn, and child 
health (MNCH); nutrit ion; water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH); m alaria prevention and case 
management; and HIV/AIDS. The project targeted four demographic life stage  audiences comprised of 1) 
Adolescents  ages 15 -17; 2) Youth/ Young adults in relationships ages 18 -35; 3) Pregn ant couples; and 4) 
Caregivers of children un der five years. The life stage s approach originated in consumer studies helps to 
identify and address evolving health needs over various stages of an individual’s life.  
Communicate for Health Programming  
As part  of an interim measure while Communicate for Health developed its life stage  programming, the 
project rebroadcast  technically sound TV and radio spots inherited from the previous USAID Behavior 
Change Support program between  2015 and early 2016. During thi s period, the GHS health 
communication brand  - “GoodLife, Live it Well ” (GLLiW) - was refreshed and launched in July 2016 . 
Integrated mass media campaign s targeting audiences using a life stage s approach and the GLLiW brand 
were subsequently developed and r olled out in phases through 2019. While the c ampa ign had national 
reach, emphasis in programming targeted five USAID priority regions (Northern, Volta, Central, 
Western, Greater Accra). In total, over 77,000 spots and programs were broadcast during the lif e of the 
project on eight national TV, eight national and 26 regional radio stations and more than a dozen 
community radio stations during peak and  prime time. Radio  spots were in English and four or more 
local languages spoken in the USAID focus regions. Additionally, more than 270,00 print material s 
including posters,  pull up banners,  leaflets , and cue cards on project programming themes were printed 
and distributed to health facilities throughout the cou ntry. 
Objectives  
We leveraged Ghana’s high mobile phone ownership and voice subscriber penetrati on rates and 
prioritized an innovative mobile phone technology as the main approach to program evaluation . The 
primary objectives of the survey were to:  
1. Monitor  exposure to Communicate for Health campaigns among target audiences  
2. Monitor progress toward Com municate for Health’s Intermediate Results (changes in behavioral 
determinants) and Strategic Objectives (changes in behaviors)  
3. Examine dose -response relationsh ips between exposure to health communication messages and 
behavioral determinants and behavior s 
A secondary objective was to evaluate feasibility and efficacy  of collecting project monitoring and 
evaluation data via mobile phone.

 Methods  
This evaluation ut ilized a non -experimental, repeat cross -sectional quantitative design. A new and 
independent sam ple was recruited during the third project year (2017) and again during the final project 
year (2019) —referred to as timepoints 1 and 3 (T1 and T3).  Table 1 out lines the approximate timing of 
the surveys in relation to the Communicate for Health Programmin g trajectory.  The protocol, informed 
consent forms, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol or consent forms were submitted to 
FHI 360’s Office of Interna tional Research Ethics and the Ghana Health Service Ethics Review 
Committee for review and appro val.

Study participants  
The target populations for this study included a “national sample ” of mobile phone users from all regions 
in Ghana who were at least 18 years old and a smaller sa mple from any of the five USAID target regions 
who fell into one of the projects’ life stage  target audiences. Life stage audiences comprised of 1) Male 
and female young adults ages 18 -35; 2) Pregnant women and their male partners ages 18 -49; and 3) Male 
and female caregivers of children under five years ages 18 -49. The latter groups are referred to as the 
“life stage sample” or as individual life stages throughout this report.  National sample respondents  were 
asked to complete questions about demographic c haracteristics and a core set of questions about 
campaign exposure and bednet  use (Table 2). The life stage sample respondents  were asked to answer 
additional questions about health topics targeted to their specifi c life stage (Table 2).

Data Collection  
Communicate for Health partnered with Viamo  to conduct the surveys using mobile phones with 
Interactive Voice Response (IVR) techno logy. This technology involves placing phone calls to participants 12 
 who then hear a pre -recorded voice read out question s in a variety of local languages, and then 
participants answer through keypad presses on their mobile phone. Participants who accepted t he cal l 
and responded to the survey did not incur airtime charges.  
Respondents were sampled using random digit dialing  (RDD). This technique uses random number 
generators to generate potential Ghanaian phone numbers using the basic structure of mobile pho ne 
numbers in Ghana. This yields a sample that is a random set of mobile phone owners where each SIM 
card has an equal chance of being selected into the sample. Five languages were supported  including 
English  and four major local languages - Twi, Ewe, Dagb ani, and Ga.  
Data Analysis  
We calculated weighted sample sizes to address disproportionate representation based on reg ion, 
gender, and age compared to the Ghana Statistical Service’s (GSS) population projections . Separate 
weights were calculated for each wave o f data collection . These weights were used only for the national 
sample, aggregate life stage sample,  and young men and women when the sample size was sufficient 
based on our sample size estimates  (at least 500 respondents per comparison group) . Statistica l analyses 
were done using weighted data.  Primary outcomes for this evaluation were categorized into three 
groups: self-reported exposure  variables —including TV  and radio exposure, GLLiW exposure, and 
number of health messages heard or se en; behavior deter minants —including se lf-reported interpersonal 
communication, gender norms, and intention to act ; and self -reported behavior. These outcomes were 
assessed across five health topic areas: malaria prevention, pregnancy prevention, facility -based delivery, 
handwashing with soap and water, and infant and young child feeding (IYCF).  
The analysis of the main outcomes of this study were primarily descriptive. Limited inferential statistical 
analyses were conducted for exploratory  purposes  for samples and topics where the sample size was 
sufficient (at least 500 in both comparison groups) to  assess the statistical significance of differences.  
Statistical  tests were conducted using two -sided comparisons and 5% significance level s. Comparisons 
between years considered  the T1 and T3 samples to be independent. Bivariate (i.e., chi -square te st) and 
multivariable analyses (i.e., logistic regression) used sampling weights and appropriate survey design 
adjusted methods including accountin g for sampling stratification based o n the weighting strata.  
We ran multivariable analyses using logistic reg ression models to assess the adjusted association 
between exposure variables and binary behavior and behavior determinant variables. We ran separat e 
models for each type of exposure va riable (i.e., radio and TV , GLLiW , and number of messages ). We 
applied  two sets of models for the multivariable analyses . First, we ran the models for each type of  
exposure variable including all relevant covariates. S econd, we explored if the association between 
exposure and outcome varied  according to the levels of the covariates by assessing interaction effects 
(i.e. effect modification). We included all exposure  by covariate interactions and ran a backward 
selection  process to remove non -significant int eraction terms.  
Findings , Discussion  and Recommendations  
This section of the report summarizes key findings and recommendations and highlights some 
limitations. M ore thorough presentation of the findings is available in the main report and appendices.  
Background characteristics:  Respondents shared similar background characteristics across the two 
timepoints (more men, more young men, more urban dwellers, more singl e respondents and only one in 13 
 four respondents had a ch ild under five). There were minimal di fferences in education level and general 
media exposure between T1 and T3.  At least seven in ten respondents had completed Middle/ Junior 
High School or higher le vel of education with a significantly higher proportion  completing tertiary or 
higher level o f education at T3 (25.6 percent) than T1 (20.0 percent). Overall, TV viewership increased 
(from 80 percent to 82 percent) while radio listenership declined at T3 ( from 79 percent to 75 percent).  
The primary limitation  of the evaluation is selection bias r elated to recruiting a convenience sample and 
conducting surveys via mobile phone. While Communicate for Health’s communication campaigns are 
promoted nationally t hrough both TV and radio, the sampling frame is limited  to mobile phone users. 
While mobile p hone penetration is fairly high in Ghana2, use rates are lower among women and rural 
users, which is reflected in our larger sample  of men and urban respondents in the national sample. 
Overall, we were unable to recrui t adequate sample sizes among male caregivers  of children under five, 
female caregivers  of children under five, pregnant women, or partners of pregnant women to allow fo r 
statistical comparison across years within our project timeline and budget. The proje ct prioritized 
English and four local languages spoken in the USAID priority regions ( Northern - Dagbani, Western 
and Central -Twi, Greater Accra -Ga, Volta -Ewe) so it was possible t hat some language groups in non -
priority regions may not have been reache d as effectively  during the survey.  
Exposure to communication message s: As noted above, overall radio listenership declined across 
the two surveys, while TV viewership increased.  Improvements  in intensity of exposure to any health 
topic-specific advertise ments in the previous month  (i.e. numb er of messages or adverts seen or heard) 
were limited  based on T1 and T3, with the exceptions of improvements in e xposure to any ITN 
messages for the national sample  (Table 3) . As noted in the introduction, GLLiW broad casts ended 
before the final survey du e to program close out. The one-month recall period for questions on the 
total number of adverts heard or seen  (which was utilized to match the reporting period at T1) might 
have contributed to lower reports of exposur e at T3 and in part helps to explain a ny decreases and 
nonsignificant shifts in exposure observed at T3

Generally, exposure to GLLiW branded programming  was high at T3 for all health topic areas (Figure 1).  
Recall of these  adverts were not time bound. Although not an explicit target of our analysis, there was 
some evidence that the life stage targeting of mes sages was effective, as recall of the YOLO  program3 
was highest among young adults -the intended audience of this camp aign. Program monitoring reports 
show that f rom 2017 to 2019, YOLO  received over 21 million YouTube views, 640,000 Facebook likes,

were aired  on radio, television, and social media.  14 
 460,000 Instagram and 63,000 Twitter followers , the majority of whom were young people. Use of l ife 
stage-based programs tail ored to carefully segmented audiences may be  critical for reach and impact.

Changes in self -reported b ehavioral determinants and behaviors: Across most topics, 
improvements  in interpersonal communication and intentions were limited , possibly because of the 
relatively hig h reports at T1.  When looking at c hanges in self-reported  behaviors, bednet use inc reased 
significantly across all regions  between T1 and T3  (Table 4). Although bednet use appeared to improve 
among pregnant women, it remained unchanged among children under -five according to caregiver 
repor ts. However, GLLiW programming broadcast in 2018 and 2019 had minimal focus on malaria 
prevention in under -fives (Figure 2), and this might have impacted on the trend observed.

The majority of respondents reported practicing handwashing after using the toilet at T3 (83.8 percent), 
although the availability of handwashing stati ons with soap and water didn’t inc rease s ubstantially 
between T1 and T3 according to life stage respondents. Modest increases in use of modern FP methods 
to prevent or delay pregnancy were recorded between T1 and T3 for sexually active young men who 
said t heir partner was not currently pre gnant o r planning to become pregnant and among sexually active 
female caregivers who were not currently pregnant or trying to become pregnant. Some shifts in type of 
modern methods used were observed, including modest incr eases in use of condoms and long 
acting/p ermanent methods. The survey recorded significant improvements in agreement with equitable 
gender norms around joint responsibility for pregnancy prevention and child care (Table 5) .

Relationships between exposure and behavioral determinants and behaviors:  This is one of 
the first studies to utilize  IVR and RDD methods to demonstrate a dose response rel ationship between 
exposure to messaging, behavioral determinants and behaviors. In our survey , we looked at the 
relationships between three types of exposure variables (struc tural—TV or radio access ; coverage of 050001000015000200002500030000350004000045000

the desired behaviors of sleeping under an ITN and handwashing after using the toilet  among the 
combined life stage sample (Table 6) .

These patterns largely remained significant after controlling for age, education, life s tage, and res iding in 
a rural vs. urban area  (Table 7) . For example, r espondents in the life stage sample who were  exposed to 
GLLiW handwashing programming were 2.53 times more likely to report washing their hands after last

When looking at the national sample, listening  to the radio, recall of GLLiW malaria adverts, and 
exposure to higher numbers of messages about malaria  were all significantly associated  with self-
reported bednet use  and caregiver reports of all children in the household sleeping under a bednet . Even 
though the proportion of children  reportedly  sleeping under a bednet did not improve significantly 
between T1 and T3 based on caregiver repo rts, our dose -response analysis showed that at T3  
caregivers who were exposed to GLLiW malaria messages  were 1.9 8 times more like ly to report all 17 
 their children under five slept under an ITN net than those not exposed , even after c ontrolling for age, 
educa tion, gender, and residence in rural vs. urban area or priority vs. non -priority region (Table 8).

Overall, while we did not see large improvements in self -reported adoption of healthy behaviors 
between the two timepoints, those who reported enacting these  behaviors  at T3 were much  more likely 
to have been exposed to the GLLiW programming develope d and broadcasted by the Communicate for 
Health project . Likewise, although reported radio listenership declined between the two time periods, it 
appears to remai n an effective media for be havior change, as listening to the radio every or most days 
was sig nificantly associated with behaviors across most health topics promoted by the Communicate for 
Health project. USAID and GoG should sustain these patterns through  the continued and intensif ied use 
of mass media to broadcast audience segmented programming o n popular stations in local languages at 
prime time.  
Communicate for Health was limited to using “above the line” mass media programming to influence 
behavior ch ange. To reach “last mile” audiences, future SBCC programs may need an approach that 
combines “above the line” and “below the line” interpersonal communication and community 
engagement using multiple channels targeting multiple audiences with behavior chan ge programs. SBCC 
approache s should always be paired with appropriate structural interventions  and health systems 
strengthening to ensure increased demand is commensurate with access to high quality services and that 
barriers that cannot be addressed throu gh mass media alone  (such a s poverty, experience or threat of 
violence, or experience or fe ar of stigmatization) are tackled .  
Learning from IVR/RDD . Our results indicate that i n Ghana, using IVR and RDD methodology was 
most suitable for reaching popula tions with high er access to mo bile phones, especially people 35 and 
younger from urban o r peri -urban areas and men. Response rates for both the national and life stage  
samples declined at T3 due to varied factors. In the future, supplementing mobile phone  surveys with  
household surveys  for rural areas and areas with low mobile penetration could address coverage bias.  
Audio bytes  of adverts were included in the survey at T3, which may have helped to improve  recall  
across all health topics. To sharpen measu rement of recall of health comm unication messages, programs 
need to include some identifiable aspects of their messaging (e.g., logo, character, audio byte etc.) in the 
survey questionnaire. However, comparing exposure to exact message clip s at multiple ti mepoints can 
be challenging, as  a true baseline would occur early in the life of projects (before exposure  or messages 
are developed ) and campaign materials may change over the course of the project.  
Additionally, prior experience shows th at response rate s decrease for IVR surveys with  more than 20 
questions, and thus we could only ask a limited number of questions per participant. Furthermore, 18 
 without a face -to-face interviewer we could not probe or ask clarifying questions of participants  or vice 
versa, which may reduce the number of respondents consenting to complete the survey or increase the 
number of respondents who complete only part of the survey.  While errors due to data reentry are 
eliminated by use of IVR technology, there is pote ntial that respo ndents may enter the wrong key and 
thus give incorrect or unintelligible responses.

 Background  
The five -year cooperative agreement awarded to FHI 360 (prime) and its consortium of partners,  
Creative Storm Networks, Ghana Community Radio Networks an d Viamo4 sought to improve the 
health and well -being of Ghanaians through a broad range of “above the line” mass media 
communication campaigns and capacity building for HPD and a local SBCC organization. The project 
supported the GHS to increase demand for and use of key health services  through sustained evidence -
based social and behavior change communication (SBCC) and adoption of positive health behaviors 
across FP; MNCH; nutrition; WASH; malaria prevention and case management; a nd HIV/AIDS. The 
project ta rgeted four demographic life s tage audiences comprised of 1) Adolescents ages 15 -17; 2) 
Youth/Young adults in relationships ages 18 -35; 3) Pregnant couples; and 4) Caregivers of children under 
five years. The life stages approach  originated in consumer stu dies helps to identify and add ress evolving 
health needs over the various stages of an individual’s life.  
The project has three key results areas:  
• Improve behavior change in FP, MNCH, WASH, nutrition, malaria prevention and case 
management  
• Strengthen the c apacity of the GHS/HPD to lead  design, development, coordinate and 
implement evidence -based social and behavior change campaigns  
• Develop and strengthen the capacity of a local SBCC organization to be a potential direct 
recipient of USAID funding.  
 
Communic ate for Health Programming  
As an interim measure to accelerate exposure of SBCC programming across a range of audiences while 
Communicate for Health developed its life stage programming, the project broadcast technicall y sound 
TV and radio spots it inherit ed from the previous USAID Beh avior Change Support program in 2015 
and early 2016. Working collaboratively with the GHS and partners, an overarching health 
communication brand of the GHS - “GoodLife, Live it Well” (GLLi W) was refreshed and launched in July  
2016. An integrated mass medi a campaign using the GLLiW brand on health themes described above 
was developed in 2017 and scaled up through 2019 targeting appropriate audiences using the life stages 
approach. While the campaign was rolled out nationwide, e mphasis in programming targete d five USAID 
priority regions - Northern, Volta, Central, Western, and Greater Accra. Over the years, numerous 
health communication campaigns and programs were broadcast in multiple languag es including the 
GoodLife Story Serie s, the Slice of Life  campaign (which included personal endorsements by the First Lady 
of Ghana), the Maternal Health Channel and the television megahit YOLO  - You Only Live Once 
(Seasons 3, 4 and 5). In total, over 77,0 00 spots and programs were broadcast during the life of the 
project  on eight national TV, eight national and 26 regional radio stations and more than a dozen 
community radio stations during peak and prime time. Radio spots were in English and local languag es 
spoken in the USAID priority regio ns while longer format TV prog rams were in English. Additionally, 
more than 270,00 print materials including posters, pull up banners, leaflets and cue cards on project

 technical areas were printed and distributed to he alth facilities throughout the countr y. The distribution 
of program ming by health theme and year is presented in Figure 3. 
Figure 3 Distribution of Spots/Programs Aired  
 
Thousands of GLLIW adverts and programs were broadcast during prime and peak time on national TV 
and national and regional radi o stations between T1 and T3 (Figure 4). In total, over 18,000 
adverts/programs were aired during this time frame on multiple stations, with 26  percent  dedicated to 
malaria p rogramming, 24  percent  to nutrition, 19  percent  to FP/RH, 14  percent  to MNCH, 9  percent  to 
handwashing and 8  percent  to promoting the GoodLife  brand as presented in Figure 3. It is worth nothing 
that major television and radio broadcasts by the Communicate  for Health project came to an end 
about a month pri or to the commencement of the IVR survey  discussed in this report . This was in 
preparation for project closeout activities (Table 1).  050001000015000200002500030000350004000045000

Objectives  
The project was not resourced for face -to-face household data collection. We instead leveraged 
Ghana’s high mobile phone ownership and voice subscriber penetration rates and prioritized an 
innovative mobile phone technology as ou r mai n approach to M&E in a ccordance with its Activity 
Monitoring and Evaluation Plan (AMEP). Data collected through this study were used to monitor 
exposure to Communicate for Health programming and improvements in determinants and adoption of 
health beha viors. The association betw een exposure and changes in determinants and health behaviors 
were explored with these data.  
The primary objectives of the survey were to:  
1. Monitor exposure to Communicate for Health campaigns among target audiences  
2. Monitor progr ess toward Communicate for Health’s Intermediate Results (changes in behavioral 
determinants) and Strategic Objectives (changes in behaviors)  
3. Examine dose -response relationships between exposure to health communication messages and 
behavioral determinants and b ehavior s 
A secondary o bjective was to evaluate feasibility and efficacy  of collecting project monitoring and 
evaluation data via mobile phone.

 This evaluation utilized a non -experimental, repeat cross -sectional quantitative design . A new and 
indepe ndent sample was recruited during the third project year (2017) and again during the final project 
year (2019) —referred to as timepoints 1 and 3 (T1 and T3 ). A complete report on the results of T1 and 
a smaller follow up survey  conducted in 2018 with life stage respondent s from T1 —referred to as 
timepoint 2 (T2 )—are reported elsewhere5,6. The surveys were designed to gather information on the 
number of times each respondent had seen or heard programming  around the Communicate for Health 
topics (dosing), the number of regions  the campaigns reached (reach), determinants of respondents’  
behavior —including interpersonal communication, information seeking, gender norms, and behavioral 
intentions, and respondent health behaviors related to the interventions Com municate for Health 
promoted. The target populations  for this study included a national sample of mobile phone users from 
all ten regions in Ghana and a smaller sample from the five target regions who fell into one of the 
projects’ life stage  target audien ces. Any person who a nswered the phone was eligible for survey 
participation at T1 or T3 if they were at least 18 years old. The protocol, informed consent forms, and 
any subsequent amendments to the protocol or consent forms were submitted to FHI 360’s Office of 
International  Research Ethics  and the Ghana Health Service Ethics Review Committee for review and 
approval.  
Sample Size  Estimation  
To detect a 10 -point minimum difference (e.g. from 50 -60 percent ) in the indicators of interest (e.g., 
exposure) with  90 percent  power for a two -sided comparison (e.g. Time 1 versus  Time 3) with 5  
percent  significance, we estimated a minimum of 519 completed surveys from each panel of respondents  
would  be required. Based on similarity of questionnaire content and pilot r esults, the  youth (18 -24) and 
young adult (25 -35) life stage s were combined into one stratum for data analysis purposes. Based on 
pilot testing , we anticipated that pregnant couples and caregivers would be more difficult to reach than 
young adults; therefo re, recruit ment quotas were linked to a target sample size of 700  female and male 
youth & young adults  for each  panel , meaning data collection ended for each survey wave  when the 
quotas of youth and young adults were met.  
Data Collection   
Comm unicate for Hea lth partnered  with V iamo (formerly Voto Mobile) to conduct the surveys using 
mobile phone s with Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technology. This technology involves placing 
phone calls to participants who then hear a pre -recorded voice in a variety of loc al languages read out 
questions , and then participants answer through keypad  presses on their mobile phone. Surveys were 
initiated by the Viamo platform as outgoing calls. Thus, participants who accept ed the call and respond ed 
to the su rvey did not incur a irtime charges.  
Respondents  were sampled using r andom digit dialing (RDD). This technique uses random number 
generators to generate potential Ghanaian phone numbers using the basic structure of mobile phone 
numbers in Ghana. This yield s a sample that is t ruly a random set of mobile phone owners where each 
SIM card has an equal chance of being selected into the sample . During T1, each randomly selected

 number was attempted up to three  times  and respondents had the option to call back if the call was 
disconn ected or the time was inconvenient . Based on budgetary limitations, during the final T3 wave, 
each number was attempted only one time and participants were not able to call into the system . At T1, 
calls were made on 27 days , between 7 Febru ary-16 March.  T3 survey data collection took place over 
52 days, between  July 6 – August 31 , 2019. At T1 calls were dialed between  8 AM and 8 PM daily; at T3, 
numbers were dialed within the hours of 10 AM and 8 PM daily. A complete write up of the T1  data 
collection is av ailable in the baseline report.  
At both timepoints, e ach successful dial began with a brief introduction , language selection , and informed 
consent . Respondents were told the call was free, names would not be collected, data were confidential , 
and participa nts must be 18 or older. Informed consent was indicated by asking respondents to press ‘1’ 
to continue with the call. Five languages were supported: English, and four local languages –Twi, Ewe, 
Dagbani, and Ga. Thes e languages were selected based on the ma jor ethnicities represented in the 
USAID priority regions.  The survey instrument underwent several design iterations including 
adjustments to e nhance the presentation via mobile phone. The final version was translated and 
recorded  by native speakers of eac h language. Translations were subsequently verified independently, 
and adjustments incorporated into the audio recordings. For each language, the audio recordings were 
made by the pers on who participated in translation of the survey instrument, thus ensuri ng full 
familiarity with the survey phrasing. Female  voice talents were utilized for all languages.  
All adult participants who consented to participate in the survey were asked to com plete questions 
about demographic characteristics and a core set of ques tions about campaign exposure and bednet  use 
(referred to as participants from the “national sample” —Table 2). A subset of participants from five 
target regions in Ghana who met demogr aphic criteria based on Communicate for Health’s life stage s 
were asked to answer additional questions about health topics targeted to one of the following 
audiences (referred to as  the “life stage  sample”):

The Viamo platform supports complex branching logic that allows a survey to be tailored based on a 
respondent’s answers to one or more questions. This survey took advantage  of this feature, offering an 
extended set of questions to respondents who met the study’s eligibility requirements. As a result, the 24 
 number of questions comprising a completed survey varied from 16-50 questions at T1 and 17-47 at T3 
depending upon the res pondent’s eligibility and participation in the life stage  survey (Table 3). All 
questions and responses were presented in the same order for all respondents within an eligibility 
group. The table below shows the average amount of time taken to complete the  survey and the 
number of questions asked of each respondent ; total number o f questions differed within samples due to 
skip patterns.  The complete questionnaire is available in Annex 1 .

At T1 and T3, Communicate for Health team offered an airtime incentive of five Ghanaian Cedis 
(approximately $.87 US) to female caregivers  of children  under 5 and pregnant  women  who completed 
the extended life stage  survey.  At T1, incentives were also  offered to young women. The offer was 
communicated at the point of formal consent to participate in the life stage  study and informed the 
participant that the airtime would be  awarded after completion of the survey. Thi s approach was 
approved by the Ghana  Health Service Ethics Review Committee.  All airtime awards were transferred 
to qualifying participants within 1 week after survey completion.  
Data Analysis  
Data Weights  
We ca lculated weighted sample sizes to address di sproportionate representation based on region, 
gender, and age compared to the Ghana Statistical Service’s (GSS) population projections7. Separate 
weights were calculated for each wave of data collection (T1 and T3). To calculate the sample sizes for 
the T 1 and T3 national surveys by weighti ng strata, only respondents who completed the national 
sample survey were included. Originally, weights were calculated for the entire completed sample using 
80 strata (four ag e categories); upon reviewing the data, resp ondents aged 50 years or older were 
excluded from analyses because of their small representation in the dataset and because they are not a 
primary audience for many of the promoted behaviors (i.e. pregnancy preve ntion/family planning 
behaviors are targeted  toward respondents 49 years or youn ger). T1 sample weights were constructed 
using the GSS projected population estimates for 2017 for each of 60 strata (10 regions X 2 sexes X 3 
age categories); T3 sample weights were  constructed using the GSS projected populat ion estimates for 
2019 for the  same strata. Note the GSS age categories are slightly different than the Communicate for 
Health  categories, as shown in Table 4 below.

To avoid additional complexity in the ana lysis, we applied the same weights for the analysis of the data in 
the life stage  survey for  participants  in the National Sample also  meeting the criteria for a life stage  
sample and completing this part of the surv ey. It should be noted  that these weights  were not adjusted 
for the sub -sampling occurring due to exclusions prior to the life stage  survey in some groups. A total 
of 1357 young men and 14 young women at T1 and 486 young men at T3 who completed the nationa l 
sample and were otherwise eligible for the life stage sample were excluded from participation because 
the recruit ment target of 700 participants had already been met for that life stage sample. Also, for 
simplicity, no additional adjustments were made to  account for dropouts in the different life 
stage samples.  These weights were used only for the national sample, ag gregate life stage sample, and 
young men and women when the sample size had been met  based on our sample size estimates. 
Statistical analys es were done using weighted data, but tab les present both weighted and unweighted 
percentages when possible.   
Primary  Outcomes  
Primary outcomes for this evaluation were categorized into three groups:  
1. Exposure: Self -reported level of campaign exposure, stratified by life stage, health topic, and  
other sociodemographic variables. Exposure was further defined as “structur al access” 
(frequency of TV viewing, frequency of radio listening), “coverage” (heard  specific GLLiW 
messages), and “intensity” ( number of  messages about a  health topic  heard or se en) for the 
purposes of analyzing dose response relationships (Evaluation Ob jective 3 ). 
2. Behavior Determinants : Self-reported interpersonal communication, gender norms, and 
intention to act , stratified by level of exposure, life stage, and other sociodemogr aphic variables.  
3. Behavior : Self-reported behavior , stratified by level of ex posure, life stage, and other 
sociodemographic variables.  
These  outcomes were assessed across five health topic areas: malaria prevention, pregnancy prevention, 
facility -based deli very, handwashing with soap and water, and infant and young child feeding (I YCF). 
Definitions of variables are provided in Annex 2  (data dictionary).  
Analysis Methods  
The analysis of the main outcomes of this study were p rimarily descriptive and exploratory . Limited 
inferential statistical analys es were conducted for exploratory purposes  when  sample size was sufficient 
to assess the statistical sign ificance of differences betw een comparison groups  (at least 500 per 
comparison group ). Statistical tests were conducted using two -sided comparisons and  5% significance 
level. Comparisons between years considered the T1 and T3 samples to be independent. Bivariate (i.e., 
chi-square test) and multivariable analyses (i.e., logistic regression) u sed sampling weights and 
appropriate survey design adjusted meth ods including accounting for sampling stratification based on the 
weighting strata.  We present the weighted and unweighted proportions  where possible ; weighted 
percentages are never presented or discussed fo r caregivers or pregnant couples due to the small  
sample size . 26 
 Evaluation Objective 1:  Monitor exposure to Communicate for Health campaigns among target audiences  
In order to achieve the first objective, frequencies, weighte d and unweighted percentages, and weighted 
and unweighted means were calculated  for all Outcome 1 variables for T1 and T3 in a tabular format, 
stratified  by priority region for the national sample and by life stage . Weighted percentages were 
computed only for national sample results and for youth and young adult life stages.  
Chi-squar ed tests were utilized to assess whether chang es in exposure between T1 and T3 were 
statistically  significant. We used weighted data for these analyses. Observations of trends  in exposure 
for caregivers and pregnant couples are intended to be descriptive o nly due to the limited sample sizes 
achieved a nd the difficulty of obtaining accurate population estimates for weighting calculations.  
Evaluation Objective 2:  Monitor progress  toward Communicate for Health’s Intermediate Results (changes 
in behavioral dete rminants) and Strategic Objectives (changes in  behaviors)  
In order to achieve the second objective, frequencies  and weighted and unweighted percentages were 
calculated  for all  Outcome 2 and 3 variables in a tabular format at T1 and T3. Weighted percentages  
were only computed for national sample result s and for youth and young adult life stages.   
For variables related to bednet use, handwashing, f amily planning/ pregnancy prevent ion, and gender 
norms that were available at both timepoints, we used chi -squared  tests to assess the significance of 
differenc es between groups at T1 and T3  if an adequate number of responses were available based on 
our sample size estimates. Statistical analysis accounts for sampling weights and survey design.  These 
variables were pr ioritized for statistical testing for Objectiv e 2 based on Communicate for Health 
program priorities.   
Evaluation Objective 3:  Examine dose -response relationships between expo sure to health communication 
messages and behavioral determinants and behaviors  
We conducted bivariate analyses to assess the c rude association between Outcome 1 exposure 
variables and Outcome 3 behavior variables. We included chi -squared  tests for these a ssociations  when 
the sample size was sufficient (at least 500) . Tables are presen ted by priority/non -priority regions for the 
national sample and by life stage s for the life stage s sample. Only T3 data is used in the dose -response 
analyses because exposure  to messaging prior to T1 baseline is likely due to campaigns and information 
other than the GLLiW campaign.  
We also ran multivariable analyses using logistic regression models to assess the adjusted association 
between Outcome 1 exposure and binary Outcom e 2 and 3 behavior and behavior determinant 
variables. We ran separate models for  each type of exposure varia ble (i.e., structural access, coverage, 
and intensity). Models included the following covariates  (unless otherwise noted in the table) : 
• Age (18 -24; 25-35; 36 -49) 
• Education (None; Primary; Middle School; Secondary; Tertiary or Hi gher)  
• Urban/rural residence  
• Gender ( national  sample) or life stage s (life stage  sample)  
• Priority/non -priority region ( national  sample only)  
We ran two sets of models  for the multivariable a nalyses.  First, we ran the models for each type of 
exposure variab le including all relevant covariates. Second, we explored  if the association between 
exposure and outcome varied  according to the levels of the covariates by assessing interac tion effects 27 
 (i.e. effect modification). We included all exposure by covariate in teractions and ran a backward 
selection process to remove non -significant interaction terms. In Annex 4, we present Odds Ratios 
(OR) for the adjusted model with no interaction s, and a second  set of ORs only if significant interaction 
terms were identified.  In such cases , adjusted ORs for each level of the interacting covariates are given. 
ORs are presented with 95  percent  confidence intervals and corresponding p -values.   
Second ary Outcomes and Analysis Methods  
We conduct ed descriptive analyses to assess the  success and limitations of utilizing IVR and mobile

Findings  
This section of the report discusses results of the IVR survey comparing data between T1 and T3 where 
available. The presentation starts with a summary of background c haracteristics of respondents, 
followed by findings from objective 1, objective 2, objective 3, call outcomes and response rates . The 
national sample refers to p articipants from any region in Ghana who  complete d questions about 
demographic characteristics and a core set of questions about c ampaign exposure and bednet use . The 
national sample is sometimes disaggregated by priority region and non -priority region in our results. A 
subset of participants from any of the five USAID priority  regions in Ghana who met demographic 
criteria based on C ommunicate for Health’s life stages were asked to answer additional questions about 
health topics are referred to as  the “life stage sample”  (in the aggregate) or by their individual life stage 
groups.  
Respondent Characteristics  
At T3, a national sample of  6,838 respondents ages 18 -50+ was recruited; among these, a total of 1,923 
met segmentation criteria for inclusion in the life stage  sample. In comparison, more respondents were 
reached at T1 than T3; 9,469 for the national sample and 2,249 for the life stage sample at T1 (Table 5). 
The reduction in sample numbers between T1 and T3 could be attributed to more questions introduced 
at T3 to elicit information on exposure to Communicate for Health GLLiW programming. At both 
timepoints, the majority of nationa l and life stage  respondent s were males. The Youth/Young Adult 
group formed the highest number of life stage  segments recruited at both timepoints, followed by 
Caregivers  of children under five and then Pregnant couples. In accordance with the survey analy sis plan, 
persons 50 years or older are excluded from all analyses going forward in this report because of their 
low representation in the dataset  and because  they are not a primary audience for many of the 
behaviors promoted by the Communicate for Health project.

Table 6 presents background characteristics of national sample respondents disaggregated by sex at T1 
and T3.  Changes across the two tim epoints were minimal, although c hi squared tests revealed significant 
differences in education level and general media exposure ( TV/radio) between T1 and T3 . As expected  
based on our pretesting , the samples at both timepoints  included more men and urban dwellers (66.4 
percent at T1 and 64.5 percent at T3) compared to  Ghana’s most recent Population and Housing 
Census , where men  account ed for 48.8  percent  of the population and there was an almost even 
urban/rural population divide  (50.9 percent urban and 49.1  percent  rural).9 Howeve r, due to the nature 
of mobile surveying, our urban/rural  characteristics are based on individual self -report rather than 
household location or  enumeration area  as would be recorded with census data, so th is may help to 
explain the differences . Female resp ondents were more likely to be from urban areas  (71.1 percent at 
T1 and 67.3 percent at T3) compared to male  respondent s at both timepoints (66.4 percent at T1 an d 
63.0 percent at T3) , which may reflect lo wer phone ownership/access among rural women .  
Greater Accra and Ashanti regions recorded approximately half of the national sample respondents  at 
both timepoints.  Upper East and Upper West region s recorded the lo west regional share ; this finding 
aligns wi th Ghana’s latest  Population and Housing Census dat a that shows approximately 4.2 percent of 
Ghanaians live in Upper East  and 2.8  percent  in Upper West . USAID priority regions --which received 
focused Communicate for Health intervention efforts —accounted fo r over 55  percent of the national 
sample survey. Wi th respect to education, at least seven in ten respondents (77. 7 percent  at T1 and 
80.9 percent at T3) had completed middle/ Junior High School or hi gher level of education. The majority 
of respondents (90 .3 percent at T1 and 88.3 percent at T3) were ages 18-35. More than one half of 
respondents were single (58.3 percent at T1 and 58.8 percent at T3) while about four in ten were 
married or living with a partner (37.9 percent at T1 and 38.0 percent at T3). S imilar to T1, only one in 
four respondents were car egivers of a child under five at T3.  Overall, radio listenership declined across 
the two surveys, while TV viewership increased.

Objective 1: Exposure to Communication Messages  
In assessing exposure to communication messages, survey participants at T1 an d T3 were asked about 
how many adverts or messages t hey had heard or see n in the last month from any source. These 
sources might or might not include Communicate for Health project efforts. The number of adverts 
seen or heard were categorized into zero, on e to five, six to ten and ten or more messages. While 
some questions wer e asked to all respondents, including malaria prevention through the use of ITNs, FP, 
and handwashing with soap under running water, questions about facility delivery, breastfeeding, a nd 
complementary feeding only were asked to s elected life stage segments in accordance with planned 
programming. Specifically, questions on facility delivery were asked of caregivers of under -fives and 
pregnant couples, while questions on breastfeeding wer e asked among only caregi vers of children les s 30 
 than six months of age. Questions on complementary feeding were asked of all caregivers with children 
six to eight months of age .   
Table 7 presents message exposure from any source  across several health topic s. Discussions in this an d 
subsequent sections of this report will focus on only weighted percentages  when available (i.e. number 
of respondents at least 500 at both timepoints) and unweighted percentages for caregivers and pregnant 
couples  (and other popu lations when fewer than 5 00 respondents  available) . Of all topics, exposure to 
ITN messages recorded a statistically significant increase between T1 and T3 (p<0.001) ; fewer 
respondents at T3 (22.3 percent) reported no exposure to ITN messages compared to T 1 (26.2 
percent) while th e proportion who heard or saw ten or more ITN messages increased from 34.2  
percent  at T1 to 39.0  percent  at T3. While improvements were reported on exposure to handwashing, 
facility delivery, breastfeeding and complementary feeding  messages between T1 and T3, these 
differences were not statistically significant. Quite an interesting finding was exposure to FP messages 
from any source  declined  significantly : more respondents at T3 (47.0 percent) reported no exposure to 
FP messages co mpared to T1 (43.8 percen t). The proportion of respondents who heard or saw ten or 
more FP messages declined from 20.6  percent  at T1 to 18.2  percent  at T3. Conversely, as discussed 
below, at T3 all respondents were asked if they had ever heard or seen three different GLLiW family 
planning advertisements ; across all respondents in the national sample  80.1 percent reported exposure 
to at least one of the three adverts  (See Annex 4  for additional tables).

In addition to exposure to communication messages from any source, the T3 survey assessed  exposure 
to specific GLLiW branded messages produced and aired by the project between 2017 and 2019  on 
FP/reproductive health (RH) including YOLO , malaria prevention, handwashing and breastfeeding. Here, 
no restriction on recall period was given. Also, to  aid recognition, audio bytes of adverts broadcasted by 
the Communicate for Health project were featured as part of the survey. For FP/RH, expo sure was 
measured to any of three audio bytes featured; 1) FP Slice of Life production, 2) FP Short Story Series  spot 
and 3) YOLO . In the case of malaria, recognition was measured for any two malaria adverts: 1) malaria 
prevention Slice of Life  production,  and 2) malaria Short Story spot.   Handwashing and breastfeeding 
featured only one Slice of Life advert for each topic —these were only asked of appropriate life stage 
audiences . A composite measure “Any GLLIW  asked about ” was computed for exposure to any o f the 
four health topics: FP/RH, ma laria, handwashing and breastfeeding  (for caregivers  of children under 6 
months in the l ife stage sample)  or general awareness of the GLLiW brand . Overall, the project 
reported high exposure to GLLiW messages across all l ife stages as shown in Figure 4. Among all 
groups, nine in 10 respondents (93.6 percent) reported being exposed to at least  one GLLiW health 
topic. The highest recall of 9 6.1 percent  was reported among female caregivers  and female youth/young 
adults , follo wed by male youth/young adults (94. 1 percent)  and the least exposure was for pregnant 
women ( 91.9 percent). Among all GLLiW topics, FP/RH recorded the highest exposure (80.1  percent)  
followed by malaria prevention (79.0 percent), handwashing (77.8 percent)  and the least, breastfeeding 
(66.7 percent).  
Stratifying by life stage and health topic  (Figures 5 -7), pregnant women ( 83.8 percent) and female 
youth/young adults (83.0 percent ) reported the highest exposure to any GLLiW FP/RH message and the 
least by partners of pregnant women  (70.1 perce nt). As expected, exposure to YOLO  messaging was 
highest among  youth/you ng adult s (males -57.5 percent , females -55.2 percent) in com parison with other 
life stage audiences (pregnant women -45.9 percent, partners  of pregnant  women -41.8 percent, female 
caregiv ers-39.0 percent , male caregivers -32.5 percent). On exposure to any GLLiW malaria prevention 
messages, female and male caregivers recorded the highest recall of 79.9 percent , followed by 
youth/young adult life stage (76.6  percent for males and 75.4 percent  for females) while the least 
exposure was among pregnant couples (7 4.3 percent  for women and 70.1 percent for male partners ). 
Message exposure on GLLiW handwashing was highe st among pregnant women ( 82.4 percent) , followe d 
by the caregiver  life stage segme nt (81.8 percent for females and 81.4 percent for males), the least by 
partners of pregnant women (7 3.7 percent). As expected, female caregivers reported a higher GLLiW 
breastfeeding message exposure (72.2 percent) than m en (63.8 percent).

Objective 2  Behavioral Determinants and Behaviors  
Bednets for Malaria Prevention  
Data on interpersonal communication (IPC) —operationally defined as discussing specific health topic s 
with other people such as a friend, partner or family —and intentions to use or support a pregnant 
partner to use a bednet every night  for malaria prevention in the future were gathered from pregnant 
couples and intentio ns to have all children under five in the household sleep under a bednet every night  
were gathered from caregivers of children under five. As presented in Table 8, the trend generally 
suggests marginal improvements  in IPC about  bednet use at T3. The highes t increase of 16.3 percent  in 
IPC was observed among pregnant women, followed by male care givers ( 9.7 percent)  and the least by 
partners of pregnant women  (2.7 percent) . The trend in i ntentions for future bednet  use by children  
under five years of age  and pregnant  women  did not show major shifts between the two time point s.

Self-reported b ednet use was assessed among all adult respondents ; adult respo ndents who said they 
had a child un der five were also asked about the bednet use of all children under five in their household  
for the previous night . Among the life stage sample, partners of pregnant women were asked about their 
female partner ’s use of a bednet the previous night.  Showing a signifi cant increase over T1 estimates, at 
T3 41.8  percent  of adults in the national sample reported using a bednet the previous night compared to 
36.3 percent  at T1 (p<0.001). Significantly, bednet use increased from 3 4.7 percent  at T1 to 39.5  
percent  at T3 amon g adults in USAID priority regions (p <0.01) and similarly in non -priority regions 
(from 38.2  percent  at T1 to 44.5  percent  at T3, p <0.001). While the trend suggests improvements in 
bednet use especially among pre gnant women (38.6 percent at T1 to 47.3 perc ent at T3), partners of 
pregnant women and male caregivers (36.5 percent at T1 to 42.8 percent at T3), ITN use by 
youth/young adults and female caregivers did not record any major shifts. Past bednet use among un der-
fives in the national sample re mained approximately  the same across the two timepoints with 55  percent  
of caregivers reporting that all children under five slept under an ITN. A marginal increase was however 
observed in under five bednet use in non -priority regions from 55.5  percent  in T1 to 57. 2 percent  at T3. 
Consistently, marginal increases in under -five bednet use were reported by caregivers in the life stage 
sample.

Handwashing  
Information on handwashing behavior determin ants (IPC and intentions to always wash hands  with soap 
and water ) was assessed  at both timepoints.  The trend shows improvement in handwashing IPC among 
caregivers and pregnant couples  at T3 . A decline was however observed among youth/young adults  with 
IPC decreasing significantly in males from 56.5  percent  in T1 to 49.9  percent  at T3 (p <0. 05) as 
presented in Table 10.  Increases in behavioral int entions to always wash hands with soap and water 
were reported across all life stages (p<0.001). Among young men ages 18 -35, intentions to use soap 
every time  they wash their hands increased significantly from 52.1  percent in T1 to 61.5  percent  at T3 
(p<0.001) as shown in Table 10.

Availability of a designated place for handwashing were elicit ed from all life stage s egments  at both 
timepoints . Respondents who indicated they had a handwashing station were asked about the availability 
of soap and water at this station. Additionally,  at T3 data were collected from all life stage respondents 
about  washing of hands with soap and water after last using the toilet. Overall, the trend suggest s 
marginal increases in self-reported availability of handwashing stations  for all life stage respondents (44.1 
percent at T1 and 46.8 percent at T3) a s well a s young men  (38.3 percent at T1 and 41.0 percent at T3) , 
male caregivers  (43.0 percent at T1 and 46.0 percent at T3), female caregivers  (44.8 percent at T1 and 
53.2 percent  at T3) and pregnant women  (50.0 percent at T1 and 63.5 percent at T3) . Young women 
and p artners of pregnant women reported minimal decreases in the availability of a handwashing station 
in their households, presented in Table 11. About one -third of respondents (32.9 percent) at T3 
reported having soap and water at a designated place for handw ashing in their household, showing a 
marginal increase over baseline (29.8 p ercent). Increases were greatest among young  women,  as 
presented in Table 11.

Although only three in ten respondents of those who  reported having a handwashing station had both 
soap and water available at this station at T3, 83.8 percent of life stage audiences reported washi ng their 
hands with soap and water the last time they used the toilet  (Figure 8) . In general, f emale  respondent s

Pregnancy Prevention  
Interpe rsonal communication  and inten tions about delaying or preventing pregnancy  were monitored 
across all  life stage respondents , including post -partum prevention for pregnant couples . The trend 
shows that IPC about  pregnancy prevention remained mostly  unchanged between T1 and T3  except for  
young men and pregnant women who reported 6.2 and 6.5  percentage -point  increases over baseline 
estimates (Table 12). The trend in intentions to use a method to prevent  pregnancy in the future  did not 
show significant shifts between T1 and T3  (Table 12). Again, the greatest  increases were reported by 
pregnant women and young men, while  other life stages reported only slight changes.

1 Sample size at T3 was insuff icient to assess statistical significance of changes.  
Pregnancy prevention behavior (i.e. the use of modern and  traditional methods ) was assessed among 
sexually active life stage respondents  who did not say they were planning to get pregnant. Modest 
increases in use of  modern methods to prevent or delay pregnancy were r ecorded between T1 and T3  
for sexually active young men  who said their partner was  not currently pregnant or planning to become 
pregnant and among sexually active female  caregivers  who were not currently pregnant or trying to 
become pregnant  (Table 13). When  sample size was less than 500 at one or bot h timepoints, t ests of 
significance were not conducted, and weighted percentages are not shown.

Across all non -pregnant adults in the life stage sample who said they or their partner were using a  
metho d to prevent pregnancy , condoms were the most common method at both time points, followed 
by emergency contraception  and shorter acting hormonal methods (pill s or injectables ) (Table 14). 
Reported use of condoms increased across all samples  except male car egivers . The most notabl e 
increase was recorded  among young men . Reported use of emergency contraception declined across 
the total sample but increased margin ally among female respondents. Reported use of long acting and 
permanent methods increased f rom 10 .1 percent  at T1 to 14.4  percent  at T3.  The sample size was 
insufficient to test the statistical significance of differences for individual life stages, as not all young 
people reported being sexually active in the last 12 months.

Facility Delivery  
One critical strategy for red ucing maternal morbidity and mortality is ensuring every baby is delivered 
with the assistance of a skilled birth attend ant which generally includes a medical  doctor, nurse or 
midwife  in health care facilities . Caregiver s and pregnant couple life stage segments were asked about 
place of delivery for their last birth, and future intentions for delivery place.  Additionally , IPC around 
facility delivery was assess ed among pregnant couples . Reports of delivery in health facility or maternity 
home increased amon g all respondents a part from the male caregiver  group  at T3  (Table 15). Intention 
to deliver in a health facility also recorded increases across all life stag e segments. Generally , minimal 
increases in IPC a bout facility delivery were recorded between the two time points  with a higher 
proportion among pregnant women. It should  be noted that facility deliver y behavior det erminants and 
behaviors were already generally high at T1.

Objective 3 : Relationships between Exposure and Behaviors  and Interpersonal 
Communication  
Dose -Response Relationships Among the Life Stage Sample  
Although changes in behavior and behavior determinants were marginal between T1 and T3 , cross 
tabulation of structural exposure (i.e. radio or TV viewership) , GLLiW coverage  (i.e. exposure to 
GLLiW health ads) , and exposure intensity (i.e. number of messages heard or seen in the last month) 
variables  with behaviors showed that performance of three promoted behaviors was generally higher 
among life stage sample responden ts who report ed exposure  to GLLiW messages and among those 
reporting increasing exposure to  messages in the previous month  (regardless of branding ) (Table 17 ). 
These associations  reached statistical significance  for bednet use the previous night and handwashing 
after using the toil et. Use of modern family planning showed a trend in hig her use with increasing 
exposure, but this analysis  did not reach statistical significance.

As shown in Table 18, multivar iable logistic regression showed that respondents  in the life stage sample 
who reported exposure to GLLiW health -topic specific advertising  were more likely to have discussed 
promoted behaviors with others , intend to perform the behavior in the fut ure, and to have performed 
promoted behaviors  within the recall period , even after adjusting for covariates.  These associations 
were significant for bednet use . Significant interactions were observed , however,  between the coverage 
variable and education fo r IPC an d intentions related to modern FP method use  (Annex 4, Tables 54 and 
57).  44

Figure s 11-13 provide further detail on the proport ion o f life stage respondents who reported  exposure 
to GLLiW  health -specific messaging who also reported practicing p romoted behaviors . Bednet use the 
previous night and washing hands with soap and water after the last time using the toilet was reported 
among h igher percentages of those exposed to GLLiW messages than among those who did not report 
exposure to GLLiW messages  (Figures 11 -13). These  associations were significant  among young men for 
both outcomes and among young women for bednet use  (Figure 11 ); statistical testing was not 
conducted for other life stages due to insufficient sample size (Figure 12).  Modern  FP method use was 
reported more frequently by young women and male caregivers exposed to GLLiW than among those 
not exposed, although sample size s were insufficient to assess statistical significance  even among young 
men and young women because of the relatively large proportion of youth reporting they were not 
sexua lly active in the last 12 months ( Objective 2, Table 13). Differences were marginal  among young 
men and female caregivers (Figure 13).

These trends remained after controlling for age, education, urban/rural residence, gender and prio rity

GLLiW message about ITNs) and level of education ; the different levels of association between coverage 
and bednet use across different levels of education  are shown in Table 2 1. All respondents except those 
reporting completion of primary schoo l as the highest level of education had higher odds of reporting 
bednet use if they were exposed to any GLLiW messaging.  No other interactions were found.

Similar patterns  were seen when looking at  respondents who reported children who slept  in their 
household the previous night used a bednet. This question was asked of all respondents in the national 
sample who reported having a child under the age of five  and at least one child under five sleeping in 
their household the previous night . As sh own in Table 22, respondents who listened to the radio most 
or every day, who reported being exposed to at least one of the GLLiW ITN -messages, and higher 
intensity  of malaria messages -regardless of branding  were more likely to report that all children sle pt 
under a bed the previous night. Note that while  the outcome (all children sleeping under a bednet vs 
not all) is at the household level, the exposures were reported  at the individual level.

 Secondary Analyses  
Response Rates  
Call outcomes and response rates were calculated using American Association for Public Opinion 
Research (AAPOR) standards  using unweighted data fro m all respondents (including those who 
reported their age as 50 or above) . Due to complex bran ching within the survey, a total of 16 call 
outcomes were possible (see Annex 3).  
At T3 the overall response rate for the national sample survey was 20. 2 percent,  as compared to 31.3 
percent at T1 (Response Rate 4, Table  24). The response rate for the combined life stage s at T3 was 8.1 
percent,  compared to 18.6 percent  at T1 (Response Rate 4, Table 24). The cooperation rate r emained 
above 80  percent  for the national sample at T3 but  declined among the life stage sample  (Cooperation 
Rate 2,4, Table 2 4).

+Indicates these rates were a djusted for ‘e’ following the AAPOR guidelines. ‘e’ was computed as follows: National 
Sample T1=.888 and T3=.894; Life Stage Sample T1=.349 and T3=.406.  
For the life stage calculations, the outcomes that had the greatest impact on response rates include :  
• Completed Interview – Answered the last substantive question (Gender Norms for all 
respondents)   
• Partial Interview – Consented to participate in the life stage  portion of the survey and answered 
at least one substantive question  but dropped off before answ ering the final substantive question.  
• Eligibility Unknown – In order to determine eligibility, a participant must have provided responses 
to questions on age, gender, region, age of the youngest child, and pregnancy status. Respondents 
who did complete the se questions were treated as unknown eligibility for response rate purposes.  
• Not Eligible – Includes respondents who are explicitly ineligible based on age and target region, as 
well young men  who would have been eligible , but the life stage sample  quota was already filled.  
Average Cost per Complete Survey Response  
The average cost complete national  sample survey at T3 was $5.84  and $20.80 per  completed  life stage  
interview (106 Ghanaian Cedis as of market close August 1 5, 2019). This figure include s setup costs for 
the finalized survey in strument (translations,  audio recordings, labor to setup the IVR survey ) and data 49 
 collection costs (mobile airtime, airtime incentives for female participants, labor to execute the survey). 
Additional project costs for post -collection data analysis are not  included. Further discussion of the cost 
per survey at T1 is included i n the baseline repo rt. Overall, costs of airtime increased between survey 
waves  and more calls were required to locate eligible respondents and  to achieve a complete survey 
(Table 2 5).

Potential  Limitations  
The primary limitation of the evaluation is selection bias related to recruiting a convenience sam ple and 
conducting surveys via mobile pho ne. While Communicate for Health’s communication campaigns are 
promoted nationally through mass media such as radio  and TV , the sampling frame is limited to mobile 
phone users. While mobile phone penetration is fair ly high in Ghana11, use rates are lower among 
women and rural users, which is reflected in our larger sample  of men and urban respondents in the 
national sample. Overall, we were unable to recruit adequate sample sizes among male caregivers  of 
children unde r five, female caregivers  of children under five , pregnant women, or partners of pregnant 
women to allow for statistical comparison across years within our project timeline and budget. The 
project prioritized English and four local languages spoken in the USAID priority re gions (Northern - 
Dagbani, West ern and Central -Twi, Greater Accra -Ga, Volta -Ewe) so it was possible that some 
language groups in non -priority regions may not have been reached as effectively  during the survey. 
Additionally, prior experi ence shows that r esponse rates decrease for IVR surveys with more than 20 
questions, and thus we could only ask a limited number of questions per participant. Furthermore, 
without a face -toface interviewer we could not probe or ask clarifying questions of  participants or vice 
versa, which may reduce th e number of respondents consenting to complete the survey or increase the 
number of respondents who complete only part of the survey.  While errors due to data reentry are 
eliminated by use of IVR technology, there is potentia l that respondents may enter th e wrong key and 
thus give incorrect or unintelligible responses.  
Conclusions and Recommendations  
USAID Communicate for Health conducted a final cross -sectional IVR survey from July 6, 2019 to 
August 31, 2019  to assess behavi oral outcomes for the project’s  GoodLife, Live it Well  campaigns rolled 
out since 2015. The analysis  had three main objectives: 1) monitor exposure to project campaign 
messages among target audiences; 2) monitor shifts in self-reported behavioral determina nts and 
behaviors; and 3) exami ne dose -response relationships between exposure to messages and self-reported 
                                                           
11 Adult ownership of smartphone or basic phone estimated at 80% (Internet Connectivity Seen as Having Positive 
Impact on Life in Sub -Saharan Africa.  Pew Research Center, 2018)  50 
 behavioral determinants and behaviors. This section of the report summarizes key findings and 
recommendations from the baseline (T 1) and follow on (T3) surveys.  
Background chara cteristics:  Respondents shared similar background characteristics across the two 
timepoints (more men, more young men, more urban dwellers, more single respondents and only one in 
four respondents had a child  under 5). There were minimal differences in edu cation level and general 
media exposure between T1 and T3.  At least seven in ten respondents had completed middle/ Junior 
High School or higher level of education with a  significantly higher proportion compl eting tertiary or 
higher level of education at T3 ( 25.6 percent) than T1 (20.0 percent). Overall, TV viewership increased 
(from 80 percent to 82 percent) while radio listenership declined at T3 (from 79 percent to 75 percent).  
Exposure to communication mes sages: Generally, exposure to programming  was high for all 
health topic areas especially for FP/RH (80.1  percent) . Exposure to any ITN messages improved 
significantly from 74  percent  at T1 to 78  percent  at T3  across the national sample . Although not an 
explicit target of our analysis, there was some eviden ce that the life stage targeting of messages was 
effective, as recall of the YOLO  program was highest among young adults -the intended audience of this 
campaign.  From 2017 to 2019, YOLO  received over 21 mil lion Y ouTube views, 640,000 Facebook likes, 
460,000  Instagram and 63,000 Twitter followers , the majority of whom were young people. Use of l ife 
stage-based programs tailored to carefully segmented audiences may be  critical for reach and impact.   
Behavioral  deter minants and behaviors: Across most topics, interpersonal communication  and 
behavioral intentions saw minimal improvements , possibly because reports were high at T1 . Self-
reported  bednet u se increased significantly across all regions from 36.3 percent  to 41.8 percent. 
Although bednet use improved among pregnant women, it remained unchanged among children under -
five according to caregiver reports . Malaria programming ( S and short stories) broadcasted in 2018 and 
2019 had minimal focus on malaria prevent ion in under -fives and this might have impacted on the trend 
observed. Majority of respondents reported practicing  handwashing after using the toilet although the 
availability of handwashing stations with soap and water didn’t increase substantially among life stage 
audiences. Modest increases in use of modern methods to prevent or delay pregnancy were recorded 
betwee n T1 and T3 for sexually active young men who said their partner was not curr ently pregnant or 
planning to become pregnant and among sexually active female caregivers who were not currently 
pregnant or trying to become pregnant. The survey recorded modest changes  in the types  of modern 
methods  being used , particularly in use of condoms and long a cting/permanent methods. Facility delivery 
and int entions surrounding the behavior remained high  at both time points. The survey recorded 
significant improvements in equitab le gender norms around joint responsibility (both males and female) 
for pregnancy prevention increasing from 66 percent at T1 to 70 p ercent at T3.  
Relationships between exposure a nd behavioral determinants and behaviors:  For the first 
time IVR and RDD was used to demonstrate a dose response relationship between exposure to 
messaging, behavioral determinants and behaviors. Although we ge nerally did not see large changes in 
behavior determinants or behaviors over time, we found  radio consumption , recall  of GLLiW 
programming , and greater intensity of messaging ( number of  messages  heard or seen ) were significantly 
associated with behavior ad option and determinants for most health topics  at T3 . In particular, there 
was a strong association between exposure variables and practicing the desired behaviors of sleeping 
under an ITN and handwashing aft er using the toilet. Respondents exposed to GLLi W ITN messaging 
were more likely to sleep under an ITN than those not exposed (3.61 for life stage  sample and 2.73 for 
national sam ple). Similarly, caregivers who were exposed to ITN adverts were 1.93 times m ore likely to 
report  all their children under fi ve slep t under an ITN net than those not exposed. Again, audiences 51 
 exposed to GLLiW hand washing programming were 2.53 times more l ikely to wash their hands after 
last using the toilet. Although radio listene rship declined across the two time periods, it appears to 
remain an effective media for behavior change , as listening  to the radio every or most days was 
significantly associated wit h behaviors across most health topics promoted by the Communicate for 
Health project .  
Overall, the GLLiW programming deve loped and broadcast  by the Communicate for Health project was 
associated with  positive behaviors . USAID and GoG should  sustain the se patterns  through the 
continued and intensified use of mass media especially radio to broadcast audience segmented 
programmi ng on popular stations in local languages at prime time. The project was limited to using 
“above the line” mass media programming to  influence behavior change but future SBCC programs may 
need an approach that  combines “above the line” and “below the line”  interpersonal communication and 
community engagement using a variety of  channels targeting multiple audiences with behavior change 
programs to reach “last mile” audiences. SBCC approaches should always be paired with appropriate 
structural interventions a nd health systems strengthening to ensure increased demand is commensurate 
with access to high quality services and that barriers that cannot be addressed through mass media  alone 
(such as poverty, experience or t hreat  of violence , or experience or fear of  stigmatization) are tackled.  
Learning from IVR/RDD . In Ghana, USAID Communicate for Health found that using IVR and RDD 
methodology was most  suitable for reaching populations with high er access to mobile phones,  especially 
people 35 and younger from urba n or peri -urban areas and men. Response rates for both the national 
and life stage  samples declined at T3 due to varied factors. In the future, supplementing mobile phone 
surveys with  household surveys for rural a reas and areas with low mobile penetration could address 
coverage bias.  
Audio bytes  of adverts were included in the survey at T3, which may have helped to improve  recall  
across all health topics. To sharpen measurement of recall of health communication me ssage s, programs 
need to include some ident ifiable aspects of their messaging (e.g., logo, character, audio byte etc.) in the 
survey questionnaire. However, the comparing exposure to exact message clips at multiple timepoints 
can be challenging, as a true baseline would occur early in the life of p rojects (before exposure) and 
campaign materials may change over the course of the project. As noted in t he introduction, GLLiW 
broadcasts ended before the final survey due to program close out. Restricting respon dents’ exposure 
to a one -month time frame ( to match the reporting period at T1) might have lowered reports of 
intervention exposure, at T3 and in pa rt helps to explain any decreases and nonsignificant shifts in 
exposure observed at T3 .
