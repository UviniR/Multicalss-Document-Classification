Background  
Cities in the global South are being “datafied”, with increasing presence of digital data of all 
kinds: from mobile phones, remote sensing, ground -level sensors, community mapping, e tc.  
This datafication of the city means  growing velocity, volume and variety of data used in 
urban decision -making; and expanding presence for the city’s “data twin”: a virtual but 
skewed simulacrum through which the city is increasingly planned and even experienced.  
 
Such datafication can bring significant benefits: improving the speed and quality of urban 
decision -making, or making visible issues or groups which have previously been invisible to 
formal decision -makers.  But data is a source of power: a r esource that may readily flow 
along and widen the existing urban fault -lines of socio -political inequality.  Hence the 
growing interest in “data justice” in urban locations: the way in which data intersects with 
questions of social justice – who wins and w ho loses from the new digital datasets and data 
flows, and the relationship of data to power and inequality; particularly for those already 
marginalised in the physical city.  
 
As yet, however, too little has been understood about this latter issue, creatin g the 
imperative for more work on urban data justice.  
 
Case Studies  
To help fill this knowledge gap, we commissioned – with financial support from the 
University of Manchester’s Sustainable Consumption Institute and Canada’s International 
Development Research Centre  – a set of urban data justice case studies.  These were 
intended to analyse from a data justice/rights or critical data perspective an initiative or 
phenomenon relating to growing availability and use of data in urban areas in t he global 
South.  
 Manchester Centre for Development Inform atics Working Paper 88

 From 73 submitted proposals, we selected nine for development; taking these through 
iterative rounds of discussion and revision.  The papers were presented at an international 
workshop held in Manchester in 2019, alongside a foundational case study paper on urban 
data justice that had served as a conceptual reference point for a number of the case 
studies.  In total, then, ten case studies are presented in this collection ; each of which has 
previously been published separately in this working paper series : 
 
1. An Applied Data Justice Framework: Analysing Datafication and Marg inalised 
Communities in Cities of the Global South  (Richard Heeks and Satyarupa Shekhar).  This 
presents a systematic data justice framework and uses it to analyse the impact of 
community mapping in four global South cities, with a particular focus on ineq uality.  
2. Visual Data Justice? Datafication of Urban Informality in South Africa Using 360o 
Imaging Technologies  (Jonathan Cinnamon).  This analyses the possibilities and 
limitations of 360° geovisual imag ing of urban informal settlements; identifying an 
emerging research agenda on visual data justice.  
3. Spatial|Data Justice: Mapping and Digitised Strolling against Mo ral Police in Iran  
(Azadeh Akbari).  This scrutinises the intersection of data and spatial injustice  in Iranian 
cities; looking at data initiatives both of the state and of citizen counter -surveillance.  
4. Urban Slums in a Datafying Milieu: Challenges for Dat a-Driven Research Practice  (Bijal 
Brahmbhatt, Siraz Hirani, Neha Lal & Bhumika Chauhan).  This reviews on-the-ground 
experience  of data -related projects in Indian slum communities, highlighting emergent 
issues including data accuracy and ownership.  
5. Data Ju stice through the Prism of Information Politics and Resource Injustice: A Case 
Study from Hyderabad’s Urban Frontier  (Loraine Kennedy, Ashima Sood, Debdatta 
Chakraborty & Ram Mohan Chitta).  This examines enumeration and community 
mapping exercises  in a lo w-income neighbourhood in Hyderabad; exposing the 
associated politics of distribution of information resources, risks and rewards.  
6. Aadhaar -Led Identification and Datafication Among Informal Workers in South India: 
A Data -Justice Perspective  (Shyam Krishna) .  This uses the notion of ‘abnormal justice’ 
to analyse how Aadhaar – India’s digital identity programme  – is experienced by 
informal workers in urban settings, and how it impacts current inequalities.  
7. Data Gathering and Justice in the Urban Informal Sect or: Views from the Frontline  
(Terry Gibson).  This analyses a sequence of large -scale participatory data gathering 
programmes  focused on urban disaster reduction; highlighting the impact of power 
structures on the knowledge created.  
8. Capturing Gender and Cl ass Inequities: The CCTVisation of Delhi  (Aayush Rathi & 
Ambika Tandon).  This analyses roll -out of CCTV in Delhi, demonstrating how the 
experience of surveillance is intersectionally mediated along the axes of class and 
gender . 
9. Community -Based Data Justic e: A Model for Data Collection in Informal Urban 
Settlements (Denisse Albornoz, Katherine Reilly & Marieliv Flores).  This analyses NGO -
mediated production of data about informal urban settlements in Peru, arguing that 
such processes may deepen inequalitie s unless undertaken with greater concern for 
capability development and collaborative implementation.  
10. Making Informal Settlements ‘Visible’ Through Datafication: A Case Study of Quarry 
Road West Informal Settlement, Durban, South Africa (Catherine Sutherla nd, Bahle 
Mazeka, Sibongile Buthelezi, Duduzile Khumalo and Patrick Martel).  This argues that Manchester Centre for Development Inform atics Working Paper 88  
 
9 
 data initiatives to make urban informal settlements more visible may not immediately 
secure tangible improvements but can begin to shift discourses and power rel ations . 
 
Three messages, among others, stand out.  There is increasing resistance to datafication 
among marginalised urban communities; tired of being enumerated with no obvious 
benefit.  Where data is gathered, it is processes and structures that matter m ore than the 
data or technology: shaping and constraining what datafication can achieve, but with 
evidence of new hopes, imaginaries, relations, etc brought into being.  Most successful are 
initiatives that gather new digital data but combine this with lon ger-term, qualitative actions 
that truly listen to the concerns and priorities of these communities.  
 
Future Research Agenda  
Building from the foundational findings of these case studies, what should be the priorities 
for future research on urban data just ice?  Group and plenary discussion at the international 
workshop held in Manchester developed a research agenda, as summarised in Figure 1.  We 
look forward to further research – action research particularly – that addresses these and 
related issues around  urban data justice.

1. The Downstream Information Value Chain  
- Data Uptake : to date there has been a lot of focus on the creation and visualisation of data 
on marginalised groups/communities in global South cities.  More research is needed on 
downstream issues such as data uptake: tracking use of data; identifying barriers to use; 
understanding the factors shaping data needs  and use of urban decision -makers.  
- Engaging New Urban Data : urban decision -makers are often resistant to community 
mapping/survey data.  Such resistance often has broader political and institutional 
foundations, but what new forms of data might engage th em: images (if so what type); 
audio -visual; oral histories; auto -collected from sensors, mobiles, remote sensing, etc?  
 
2. From Data to Justice  
- Impact of Data : what subjective and objective development impacts does new urban data 
have?  Cui bono : who win s and who loses from new urban data?  
- Theory of Change : what is our theory of change to move from data to social justice?  How 
exactly do we get from new urban data to . . . greater inequality; fewer evictions; fewer 
persecutions; etc?  
- Differentiating Data : how do the affordances of data link to concepts of justice?  How do 
different types of data link differently to justice?  
- Scaling and Sustaining : many pro -equity data initiatives have been constrained in scope: 
e.g. pilots or restric ted to a single slum area.  We need to understand how best to scale and 
sustain these initiatives.  
- Promoting Small Data/”Scaling Down” : how can data gathered from or about 
marginalised urban groups/communities be effectively used by these groups/communit ies? 
- Data Justice Agents : who are “data justice champions” driving forward pro -equity data 
initiatives and what do they do?  How do other actors enable and constrain achievement of 
just outcomes from new urban data systems?  
- Data -Enabled Authoritarianis m: data justice overall has tended to focus attention on data 
uses in democratic contexts.  An arguable greater threat is use in authoritarian contexts and 
for authoritarian purposes.  How are these spreading in global South cities?  How can they 
be resist ed? 
 
3. The Role of Context  
A continuous finding was the way in which context shapes the trajectory and impact of 
urban data systems in the global South:  
- The Role of Data Markets : urban data increasingly cascades into or creates data markets – 
both comme rcial markets (e.g. monetisation of data by private firms) and social markets 
(e.g. competitive use of data by NGOs).  What is the role and development impact of these 
markets?  How are these markets shaped?  
- The Political Economy of Urban Data : how, spec ifically, do urban contexts of power and 
interests shape the outcomes of new urban data flows and pro -equity data initiatives?  How 
best should we seek to govern urban data to ensure just outcomes?  
- The New Urban Data Intermediaries : new data intermediari es – actors that own and 
control data about marginalised groups/communities and intermediate from these sources 
to other urban actors – are emerging in private, public and NGO sectors.  Who are they?  
What role do they play?  
 Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
12 
 4. Action Research on Developm ent Problems  
Research can be driven from the key development problems that impact the lives of 
marginalised groups/communities in global South cities.  Recurrent themes include:  
- Invisibility : how to navigate the ambivalence of legibility and enable just representation 
that does not open up groups/communities to external exploitative agendas?  
- Gender Inequality : how can urban data system design, processes and uses ensure 
reduction rather than reproduction of gender inequalities?  
- Flooding : how can new ground -level and remote data be effectively utilised for flood 
response, recovery, mitigation and preparation?  
 
5. New Perspectives on Urban Data Justice  
- What’s New About Digital Data : what is new about the current wave of digitally -enabled 
data?  What l essons and results are familiar from community mapping, surveillance, 
information systems, etc. studies; and what is novel?  Can digital data be disruptive and 
transformative in a pro -equity way?  
- What’s New About Data Justice : again, what lessons and res ults are familiar from 
community mapping, surveillance, information systems, etc. studies; and what is novel?  
Can data justice be fruitfully combined with existing perspectives: feminist studies, urban 
geography, infrastructure studies, etc?  
- Governing t he Algorithm : how can we govern urban data systems in which guiding 
principles and decisions are increasingly invisible?

initiatives.  Addressing this gap through a focus on data’s increasing presence in urban 
development, this paper makes two contributions.  First – drawing from  the emerging 
literature on “data justice” – it presents an explicit, systematic and comprehensive new 
framework that can be used for analysis of datafication.  Second, it applies the framework to 
four initiatives in cities of the global South that capture  and visualise new data about 
marginalised communities: residents living in slums and other informal settlements.  
Analysing across procedural, rights, instrumental and structural dimensions, it finds these 
initiatives deliver real incremental gains for th eir target communities.  But it is external 
actors and wealthier communities that gain more; thus increasing relative inequality.

 1A. Introduction  
 
Datafication – the presence, use and impact of data in social processes – is a growing 
phenomenon worldwide, including in the domain of international development (Taylor & 
Broeders 2015).  This growth has seen both hopes and concerns for the developmental 
impact of new data streams (Spratt & Baker 2015).  But, because of the novelty of the 
phenomenon, writing has sometimes had to be based on overviews or extrapolations from 
pilot projects or experiences in the global North ( ibid. , Lokanathan 2017).  There have been 
relatively few analyses to date of real -world initiatives, and the field is st ill assessing 
analytical approaches to use (Sengupta et al 2017).  
 
This paper thus aims to do two things.  First, to introduce a conceptual framework drawn 
from the sub -field of data justice that can be used for analysis of data initiatives.  Second, to 
utilise that framework to analyse a set of data initiatives within the domain of urban 
development; in particular seeking to understand the full breadth of impact of such 
initiatives on those who are already marginalised within the physical city.  
 
There foll ows next a review of datafication, particularly in relation to urban development, 
and presentation of the data justice analytical framework.  Then the methods used for this 
paper – study of urban data initiatives in Chennai, Nairobi, Pune and Solo through primary 
and secondary sources – are explained.  Findings and conclusions follow.

 1B. Datafication, (Urban) Development and Data Justice  
 
Data has always been part of international development as it – or at least its processed and 
utilised form, informat ion – is essential and integral to all decisions, including development -
related decisions.  But the advent of digital technologies and their significant diffusion in 
developing countries during the 21st century have led to a step change.  The increasing 
datafication of development can be described in terms of a growing volume, velocity, 
variety and visibility of data (Heeks 2018).  This increasing presence of data within 
development is part -encouraging, part -driven -by greater use of new forms and streams of  
data in decision -making; in turn leading to emergent developmental impacts associated with 
this datafication ( ibid. ). 
 
This broader picture is instantiated in the various development domains, including the 
particular focus here: urban development, with th e expanding role and importance of data 
recognised within the New Urban Agenda that is intended to guide future development 
(UN-Habitat 2017).  New forms and flows of data are especially associated with growth of 
the “smart city” agenda in the global South  (Shekhar 2016) and with the affordances of 
digital technologies: mapping cities by remote sensing, gathering environmental and other 
data via ground -based sensors, creation of “data twins” of urban areas such as mobility 
maps created by tracking mobile ph one use (Lokanathan et al 2016, Willis 2017).  
 
These initiatives come with much promise around the benefits they will bring to urban 
planning and development; improving its efficiency by enabling decisions and results to 
occur more quickly and/or more chea ply; and improving its effectiveness by enabling better 
decisions and results: better -informed, more objective, more transparent, better -able to 
meet citizens’ needs (van Veenstra et al 2014, Samarajiva et al 2015).  But alongside this 
have been concerns a bout datafication of the city (Townsend 2013, Kitchin 2014, Taylor & 
Richter 2015, Baud 2016): procedurally that initiatives are not being implemented right; 
instrumentally that the promised results are not being achieved; and critically that there are 
problematic distributive impacts.  Main critical concerns are that urban datafication is 
associated with growing inequality; especially, in developing countries, with the exclusion or 
adverse incorporation of those already marginalised within the physical cit y, such as those 
living in slums and other forms of informal settlement (Donovan 2012, Pfeffer & Verrest 
2016).  
 
Given the extent of urban inequality – 30% of the urban population in developing countries 
lives in slums (UN -Habitat 2016) – and the history o f this population being excluded from or 
marginalised by new initiatives, some development actors have begun what we may call 
pro-equity data initiatives (PEDIs).  Though coming with other labels attached, an essence of 
these activities has been creation o f new dataflows and datasets by and/or about and/or for 
slum communities.  Examples include community wi -fi that enables new dataflows within, 
into and out of slum communities; open data / right -to-information that enables new 
dataflows into slum communiti es; and community mapping that creates new datasets about 
slum communities (Chakraborty et al 2015, Willis 2017).  
 
But how should these (and other) data initiatives be understood and evaluated, given recent 
recognition of a lack of evaluative frameworks to  analyse datafication and development Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
16 
 (Hagen 2017, Sengupta et al 2017)?  One approach would follow descriptors used for the 
datafication concerns expressed above: “injustice” (Townsend 2013), “ethical concerns” 
(Kitchin 2014), “ethical challenges” (Taylor  & Richter 2015).  This would suggest analysis 
using ideas within the emerging literature on “data justice”: “the specification and pursuit of 
ethical standards for data -related resources, processes and structures”  (Heeks 2017a); a 
small body of work withi n critical data studies echoing our specific interests around equity.  
 
This has been conceptualised from a capabilities perspective (Taylor 2017, Heeks & Renken 
2018) but we wanted to take a broader view of data justice that specifically encompassed 
three things highlighted in recent literature.  First, the concerns about urban datafication 
expressed earlier: procedural, instrumental, critical.  Second, a specific focus on data and 
data praxis and data rights given the understanding from critical data studi es that any social 
injustices may relate more to forms and flows and use of data than to specifics of the 
technologies that carry and process and display that data (Taylor & Broeders 2015, Neff et al 
2017).  Third, the argument of other critical data studi es literature that broader social 
structure must be incorporated into any analysis because of its role in shaping data -related 
outcomes (Dalton & Thatcher 2014, Kitchin & Lauriault 2018).  
 
The model developed from these principles is summarised in Figure 1  (adapted from Heeks 
2017b, which should be referred to for further details of its development) and examines five 
dimensions of data justice:  
• Procedural: fairness in the way in which data is handled.  This handling is understood in 
terms of the information  value chain: the steps by which data is transformed into 
developmental results (see Figure 2).  
• Instrumental: fairness in the results of data being used.  
• Rights -based: adherence to basic data rights such as representation, privacy, access and  
ownership . 
• Structural: the degree to which the interests and power in wider society support fair 
outcomes in other forms of data justice.  
• Distributive: an overarching dimension relating to the (in)equality of data -related 
outcomes that can be applied to each of the o ther dimensions of data justice.

 1C. Case Background and Methods  
 
Among the possible types of pro -equity data initiative, we chose those involving community 
mapping, which aims to counter the relative invisibility of (i.e. lack of data about) 
marginalised communities by gathering, visualising and utilising new data on locations, 
assets and issues withi n those communities.  Mapping was chosen because it is quite well -
established and widespread as a PEDI in cities of the global South (Patel & Baptist 2012, 
Panek & Sobotova 2015).  While the analysis here speaks to broader trends of datafication, 
this mean s there is a ready direct literature and constituency of relevance.  
 
The four initiatives chosen for analysis are:  
• Map Kibera (MK): begun in 2009 by two Americans, this used local young people to 
gather data on Kibera, a slum roughly estimated at 250,000 p eople located in South -
West Nairobi, and then mapped that data.  Via creation of social enterprise GroundTruth 
Initiative, expertise from Kibera has subsequently been applied to other slum areas in 
Africa and the Middle East.  
• Our Pune Our Budget (OPOB): be gun in 2006 by local NGO, the Centre for Environment 
Education (CEE), this sought to bring greater objectivity and fairness into the city’s 
budgeting process, as a foundation for which, it organised a city -wide data -gathering 
and mapping exercise.  
• Solo Kot a Kita (SKK): begun in 2010 Kota Kita is an Indonesian NGO based in the city of 
Solo (official name, Surakarta).  Its Solo Kota Kita project sought to enable citizen 
participation in the participatory budgeting process initiated by mayor (currently 
Indones ian President) Joko Widodo.  It did this by gathering and mapping data across all 
city neighbourhoods.  Kota Kita has subsequently rolled out its methodology to other 
cities across Asia.  
• Transparent Chennai (TC): begun in 2009, this involved a series of pr ojects to gather and 
map data on issues within the city’s marginalised communities including lack of public 
services, homelessness, and informal livelihoods (specifically of waste -pickers).  In 2014, 
Transparent Chennai was rolled into a wider initiative, the Transparent Cities Network  – 
housed in local NGO Citizen Consumer and Civic Action Group – that focuses on data and 
the urban poor.  
These were chosen because they were relatively long -standing PEDIs2, which – unlike many 
initiatives – moved well beyond pilot stage; because there existed some secondary 
literature for each; and because they operated in cities with substantial slum populations: 
50% of the city population in the case of Nairobi (Kovacic & Lundine 2013), 40% in Pune 
(Jobst & Malherbe 2 017), at least 8% in Solo (Obermayr 2017), and 28% in Chennai 
(Krishnamurthy & Desouza 2015).  
 
The findings below are drawn from four sources which were combined and then analysed 
through the thematic lens of the data justice model presented above.  First,  nine interviews 
 
2 MK, OPOB and TC are ‘targeted’ pro -equity initiatives that specifically sought to reduce  marginalisation of 
slum communities; though in OPOB’s case this was seen to require city -wide data.  SKK is an ‘inclusive’ pro -
equity initiative in seeking to ensure those in informal housing were included within a wider pro -equity goal of 
“levelling the playing field” between citizens and government so that citizens could shape urban budgeting 
decisions.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
19 
 with senior figures in the data intermediary organisations (MK, CEE, SKK, TC) associated with 
each of the four projects, structured around the concepts of data justice3.  Second, 
evaluation documents from the projects which are reflective , to some degree self -critical, 
and sometimes themselves based on primary fieldwork (e.g. Menon 2013, Padmanabhan et 
al 2013, Rifai et al 2016, Hagen 2017).  Third, independent secondary sources of research 
specifically on these projects, most of which are  based on primary fieldwork (e.g. Berdou 
2011, Grillos 2017, Jobst & Malherbe 2017).  Fourth, broader independent sources that 
incorporate analysis of these projects among a number of others (e.g. Donovan 2012, 
Haklay 2013, Shkabatur 2014, Baud 2016).  
 
1C1. Background: Data Injustice and its Consequences  
 
Before analysing the cases in terms of data justice, we first outline the rationale behind the 
initiatives: the data injustices and consequences thereof which obtained prior to the PEDIs 
being undertaken.  
 
The communities studied suffer a range of injustices but of specific attention here was the 
data rights injustice relating to representation: that the physical marginalisation of these 
communities was mirrored by a virtual marginalisation within urban dat asets.  The 
communities were invisible or poorly visible: not merely that the areas themselves were 
unmapped as locations but that data on the assets, services, voices and livelihoods of citizen 
were absent (iMK1b, iOPOB2, iSKK).  Data had sometimes been g athered – by NGOs and 
academics in Kibera, by government in Chennai and Pune – but it fell short on the five 
“OCARA” measures of data quality: openness, completeness, accuracy, relevance, 
appropriateness of presentation (Heeks 2018).  Data on slums was gen erally treated as 
proprietary, and was inaccessible to the community or to other organisations (iMK2, iTC1, 
Shekhar & Padmanabhan 2015).  Where it might be accessed, the data covered only part of 
the settlement, or was many years out -of-date, or was held o n paper forms and records 
scattered across many different government departments (iOPOB2, iTC2, Shekhar & 
Padmanabhan 2015).  
 
This marginalisation within the data twin of the city – an inequality compared to the better 
representation of more prosperous and  formalised settlements (iTC2, Patel & Baptist 2012) 
– underpinned infrastructural and political marginalisation.  The lack and poor quality of 
slum data “ directly results in poor planning and maintenance of public infrastructure, and 
poor provision of pub lic services ” (Shekhar & Padmanabhan 2015:3); for instance, with lack 
of data on concentrations of population leading new toilets in Chennai to be planned and 
placed where government had available, accessible land rather than where they were 
needed (iTC3),  or with water points in Kibera poorly maintained due to lack of data on their 
functioning (iMK1b), and with every type of public service – water, sanitation, roads, 
lighting, health, education, policing, etc – provided to a very limited degree or poorly 
provided or simply not provided at all, in part due to lack of data about locations, needs, 
existing infrastructure, etc (iMK1a, iOPOB1, iSKK, iTC3).  
 
 
3 These will be referred to below as iMK1a, iMK1b, iMK2, iOPOB1, iOPOB2, iSKK, iTC1, iTC2 and iTC3.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
20 
 Lack of data also marginalised communities politically, ceding and skewing power within 
decision -making an d service provision to political elites and their interests.  With data on 
neither what the community already had nor on what it needed, there was no basis for 
engagement with urban planning decisions, nor a basis to challenge the decisions already 
being m ade, leading to political exclusion (iOPOB2, iTC2).  Those who are data -less in the 
city – the slum dwellers, the homeless, the waste pickers – could be treated much worse 
than other citizens – subject to police raids or evictions – with few consequences f or those 
guiding these actions (iTC2, iTC3, Otiso 2002, Padmanabhan et al 2013).  Likewise there was 
a lack of political accountability around provision of public services given the absence of 
data on provision decisions or on provision itself (iTC1, Menon  2013, Feruglio & Rifai 2017).  
 
 
1D. Findings  
 
As per the model shown in Figure 1, the findings here will be presented in terms of each of 
the dimensions of data justice in turn, with distributive data justice considered in the final 
section.  
 
1D1. Procedu ral Data Justice  
 
Because of the sampling or transect approaches used, only a minority of community 
members could be direct respondents within the four projects.  In only one case – Map 
Kibera – were community members used to capture data (iMK1b).  In othe r cases, data 
capture was undertaken by students (in Solo and Pune and one Chennai project) or by NGO 
or local government staff in the other Chennai projects (iOPOB2, iSKK, iTC1, iTC2, iTC3).  The 
young people employed from Kibera were able to upload the d ata captured on their GPS 
devices but in this and in all other cases, the “midstream” (see Figure 2) activities of 
recording data onto a geographic information system, processing it, and visualising – for 
example printing out as a paper -based map – were ge nerally undertaken by voluntary or 
paid professionals from outside the community (iMK2, iOPOB2, iSKK, iTC1, Hagen 2011).  
 
The data produced by PEDIs is not always used: sometimes data is gathered without 
downstream information value chain processes existin g that could feed that data into 
decisions and actions (iMK1b, Shkabatur 2014, Hagen 2017); sometimes those processes 
exist but they are not accessible, such as government decisions about urban planning or 
service delivery or evictions for which data from the community is not wanted, or for which 
officials are unaware of data being available (iOPOB1, iSKK).  It may also be used only 
indirectly: as part of general advocacy, such as pressure on government by NGOs or local 
media for slum improvements (iOPOB2, iSKK, iTC1).  
 
Where data was directly used, those involved in downstream processes might either be 
within or outside the community.  For the latter, impact was understood mainly in terms of 
visibility and results, discussed below.  Regarding the former then, for the Pune and 
Transpar ent Chennai initiatives, it was not the intention that data would be used by the 
community.  For Map Kibera, this was an aspiration but one that was not realised (iMK1a).  
In all these cases, then, any tracked use of community data was by organisations out side the Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
21 
 community.  In Solo, data was fed back to communities in the form of a “mini -atlas” (see 
Figure 3; a translation of the actual map provided in Bahasa Indonesia).  This was present in 
community meetings held as part of the overall process of partic ipatory budgeting in the 
city.  However, the minority of informal settlements and poorer residents in each 
neighbourhood plus time, confidence, literacy and other barriers to participation of the poor 
meant any use of the data for prioritisation decisions was dominated by richer residents 
(iSKK, Grillos 2017).  And these meetings were in any case only the first in a chain of budget 
decisions that were taken outside the community.  
 
In general then, although all of these were intended as pro -equity data initi atives that would 
counteract the marginalisation of informal settlements, they were somewhat “extractive” in 
utilising some community residents as data sources but largely excluding them from all 
other information value chain processes.  Exclusion from up -and midstream processes 
tended to be on instrumental grounds that they lacked skills or motivation and/or that 
mapping had to meet a short time -scale.  Exclusion from downstream processes tended to 
be for more systemic or political reasons, such as an abse nce of mechanisms for involving 
citizens in service provision or urban development decisions.  Exceptions only occurred 
through deliberate efforts of data intermediary organisations; and took quite some effort to 
achieve.  
 
It would be normal to decry this limited usage and to seek prioritisation of the 180o 
approach that extracts data from communities but then feeds it back into those 
communities so that residents and community -based organisations (CBOs) can improve 
their decision -making (Sanchez et al 2013 ).  Of course this has merit but Berdou (2011) 
observes that such prioritisation may be an external imposition.  Kiberans themselves 
prioritised the downstream use of their data not by the community, which may already 
know itself to some extent, but by out side agencies which do not know the community; 
believing this was the best way to bring in what they wanted, which was money – via visitors 
or donor funding or even business investment.  
 
Nor should one ignore the procedural benefits for communities and the ir members.  Indeed, 
one argument has been that these benefits have tended to be relatively ignored or 
downplayed compared to the instrumental impact of community data projects (iMK1b, 
Shkabatur 2014).  Even where not directly used for decisions and action s, data has value if 
fed back into the community e.g. via posters displayed at meetings or on public buildings 
(Patel & Baptist 2012, Hagen 2017, Jobst & Malherbe 2017).  There was an interpretive 
value: giving residents a feeling of pride and of greater l egitimacy as citizens.  And there was 
an epistemic value: making residents aware of issues that need addressing, and giving them 
knowledge of local services they might previously have been unaware of e.g. the nearby 
presence of a school, clinic, water poin t, toilet, etc.

 This broad but shallow impact of data capture and dissemination ran alongside reports of 
deeper but much narrower impacts on those who were gathering the data. They gained 
human capital in the form of technical skills and confidence and greater knowledge of the 
community, and social capital – both quantum of connections and qualitative gains of 
greater trust – in the form of a network of contacts in the community, intermediary  
organisation and more widely (iMK1b, iTC1, Berdou 2011).  But, of course, only in the case 
of Map Kibera were these gains for community members, and the social capital then only 
arose due to deliberate efforts to send the Kiberan mappers to academic confe rences, tech 
workshops and so forth (Hagen 2017).  
 
There were other process gains but they always lay outside the community:  
higher -level technical skills developed by the data professionals involved in midstream 
activities (iMK2, Haklay 2013), and a comb ination of human and social capital developed by 
those within the intermediary organisation involved in using the data for advocacy purposes 
and in encouraging data -utilising activities by government such as budgeting or other urban 
planning decisions (iMK 1a, iSKK, iTC1).  While these external stakeholders continued their 
relation with the informal settlements, these capital accumulations might be applied on 
behalf of the community.  So, also, for the interpretive impact of data on external 
stakeholders.  T his was most often expressed as the changed worldview or “slum imaginary” 
of government officials; from perceiving Solo residents as passive and ignorant to seeing 
them as active and knowledgeable (iSKK); from seeing Chennai slums as illegitimate to 
accept ing if not ownership rights than at least rights to basic services (iTC1); from seeing 
Kibera as asset -poor to asset -richer (iMK1b)4. 
 
1D2. Rights -Based Data Justice  
 
Data rights – particularly the right to be fairly represented in datasets and the right to hold 
some aspects private; but also rights of data access and ownership – were most often 
discussed in terms of who and what was visible, and to whom.  
 
Informal settlements have been partly - sometimes wholly -invisible within the city; denying 
them right  of representation.  All of the PEDIs render these settlements more visible in 
some way, mapping or otherwise recording their locations, boundaries, buildings, roads, 
paths; their assets: e.g. clinics, water points, public toilets, schools, businesses, mar kets, 
religious buildings, community offices, lighting; and their issues: e.g. health problems, crime 
hotspots, levels of poverty (iMK1b, iOPOB1, iSKK, iTC1, iTC2, iTC3).  An illustrative 
comparison can be made, for instance, between Kibera’s appearance on  Google Maps and 
on OpenStreetMap; the latter used to record some of Map Kibera’s data (see Figure 4).  
 
 
4 Hagen (2017) cites the example of the District Educ ation Officer expecting there to be around 100 schools in 
Kibera where the data mapped from the community showed her that there were more than 330.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88

Kibera  
 
Right of access to these digital representations of the community was skewed.  Although 
growing over time, absence or high cost of mobile let alone fixed -line internet was notable 
in the communities.  As a result, they had to access data in paper -based form; which is more 
limited in utility (iMK2, iSKK).  For external stakeholders, digital access was much easier.  
 
This external visibility – an exercised right to more accurat e representation – brought with it 
various perceived values.  As noted above, there were changed perceptions of slums, and 
some resident felt this gave them some type of legitimacy and would offer them protection, 
for example from eviction (Padmanabhan et al 2013, Hagen 2017).  This wider visibility even 
impacted some government officials where they felt that open availability of data via the 
web might attract national or even international attention to their actions (Kovacic & 
Lundine 2013).  And, as discu ssed in the next section, there was a perceived instrumental 
value: the more complete, accurate and objective data now available was seen as the basis 
to replace or to challenge past decision -making processes that were variously regarded as 
non-existent an d/or of poor quality and/or driven by the politics of external stakeholder 
interests (iMK1b, iOPOB2,  iSKK, iTC2).  
Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
25 
  
But this external visibility draws in Scott’s (1998) notion of legibility: the process by which 
states simplify and standardise data about th eir citizens in order to control them.  Legibility 
disrupts local control over data and knowledge, undermining the power and the value of 
local understandings within slums (Donovan 2012, Sanchez et al 2013).  When data is owned 
and held within the local co mmunity, there is local control; no doubt skewed and imperfect 
but localised nonetheless.  As data becomes more widely circulated – up to the point where 
web -based digital forms are available to anyone, anywhere with internet connectivity – that 
local cont rol is lost.  These slum areas – all of which now exist virtually in some form of web -
based map – are now legible not just to the state but to local and international NGOs, donor 
agencies, media organisations, academics (iMK1b, iSKK); all of whom can know the slum to 
some extent and make decisions and actions using data about the slum without the 
permission or even the knowledge of anyone living there.  The right to be represented can 
thus mean that the right to own and control is ceded to these external ag ents and to their 
particular interests and agendas, benevolent or otherwise.  
 
This loss of control and histories of data extraction to the benefit of others but not the 
community have led to resistance to data capture; with rights to privacy being asserted .  
Residents in Kibera were often antagonistic to data being captured by video after years of 
NGOs, movie -makers, tourists, media organisations coming to the area, and making it visible 
to external audiences for their own rather than the residents’ advanta ge (Hagen 2011, 
Benequista 2015).  Some businesses – schools, pharmacies – in Kibera did not wish to be 
mapped, fearing their visibility to the state might lead to closure if their location became 
known and their informal status or activities (e.g. sales o f stolen drugs) were then 
discovered (Berdou 2011).  Particular settlements in Chennai refused to participate in data -
gathering as they believed drawing attention to their existence and informal status – being 
under the “gaze of the state” – would increase  the likelihood of eviction (iTC1).  Transparent 
Chennai itself had concerns about this – for example, capturing data on issues facing 
informal waste -pickers in the city but not their location or legal status, in order to protect 
them from state action (iT C3).  If given a choice (which many were not) most slum dwellers 
had expressed primacy of their right of representation: to be incorporated into urban 
datasets.  But for some this was seen to be in tension with their right to privacy, and for a 
few who wis hed to fly under the state’s radar the latter was dominant.  
 
While varying across projects, local residents could sometimes shape the balance between 
rights of representation and privacy, making an input to determination of what data should 
be captured and , hence conversely, what remained invisible.  More broadly, there should be 
recognition of who and what remain invisible, without a realised right to representation.  
Transient populations (e.g. labourers or street sellers who come daily into the city to m ake a 
living but then leave) , the homeless5 and in some cases those without legal citizenship were 
excluded from data gathering and hence from representation (Feruglio & Rifai 2017).  
Qualitative data was lost: what is captured is simplified and deracinat ed, stripping away the 
local meanings and histories and relations and all other aspects of local knowledge into 
which data is always embedded, leaving knowledge -less data that is mobile and readily 
inserted into external contexts and processes (Hagen 2011) .

If we look at urban decisions, then data can be provided about four elements: background, 
priorities, process and results.  Background data – location, assets, etc – about slum 
communities was universally provided.  The needs and priorities of those com munities were 
sometimes made visible and sometimes not.  But other aspects often stayed invisible with 
community members being granted no right to access: the process by which decisions were 
made e.g. by government officials; the final decisions; and the e xtent of implementation of 
those decisions.  As a result, community members were unable to either participate in or 
monitor the decisions being made about them unless the data intermediary organisations 
undertook specific actions to counteract this (iTC2, Menon 2013, Feruglio & Rifai 2017).  
 
Finally, we observed what may be called “spotlight and shadow”: by rendering some issues 
more visible, others can be rendered relatively more invisible.  This was most notable in the 
Transparent Chennai case where TC it self and other groups had collected and published 
data about the resettlement tenement blocks into which some slum residents had been 
moved following eviction.  They saw some limited improvements in those blocks but that 
this data activity “ would also legitimise or validate these tenements and the approach of the 
government to evict slum dwellers and resettle them in far -flung, poor quality tenements”  
(iTC1).  By highlighting the tenements, data -gathering was seen to adumbrate the eviction 
process and t o encourage an increased rate of tenement building and eviction in the city: 
representation of one group and issue thus ‘unrepresenting’ another group and issue.  As a 
result, TC had stopped gathering this type of data.  
 
1D3. Instrumental Data Justice  
 
The evidence available is of relatively few results arising from direct decisions and actions by 
community residents and community -based organisations.  These results likely exist – 
residents using a school or clinic they were previously unaware of; residents  attending a 
community meeting having seen a map of issues – but they were not captured.  This reflects 
the more general point noted above.  Users of the open data twin of communities – 
whether on a public poster or loaded onto a web site – and any resulti ng actions within the 
community are untraceable unless they contact or otherwise come to the attention of data 
intermediaries (Hagen 2017).  
 
In all four cases, government was a downstream presence.  Systematic tracking of the value 
chain through to results  seemed, unfortunately, to be rather rare; let alone independent 
verification.  Evidence was thus based more on anecdotes and claims than one would have 
wished, and more on decisions such as plans than on implemented actions:  
• Gathered data – in the form of  community “mini -atlases” – was fed into community 
decision making to set priorities for spending of devolved budgets in Solo. The actual use 
of the data as information for prioritisation appears to have been somewhat limited 
(iSKK).  Rifai et al (2016:63)  describe this process as “challenging”, in part because it is 
management committees that then make final decisions on which projects will be 
funded.  While the end result is community development projects, the link to data is 
unclear, and analysis shows s pending to flow disproportionately to the least -poor areas 
(Grillos 2017).  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
27 
 • Community data was used in Pune as the basis to set an objective, needs -based budget 
that took account of the prevalence of poverty and inadequate housing across the city.  
Unfortun ately that budget was then “unset” by local politicians (iOPOB1).  Slum areas 
did see some investment but there was a skew towards middle -class issues (e.g. road 
building/improvement) and areas: 40% of Pune’s population lives in slums but only 10% 
of the b udget was allocated for slum improvement (Menon 2013).  
• Data from Map Kibera was used to improve government resource flows into Kibera 
schools, including involvement of informal school teachers in government -run activities 
such as a teachers’ retreat (Hagen 2017).  But the resource flow was, as expected, 
mainly to the 25% of schools that were government -run, while the extent and 
sustainability of wider results was unclear.  
• Transparent Chennai engaged more with government from the start of the project b ut 
the reported outcomes were rather circumscribed: the city built 15 homeless shelters 
not the 75 that the data had shown to be required (iTC1), or laid on a ceremony to 
present a few waste -pickers with entry cards to the local waste site, but not the ID cards 
they had been seeking (iTC2).  
 
Other uses were also limited, and examples only given for Kibera: of international 
development agencies and NGOs using the data for improved planning of education 
resource flows, or for siting of water and sanitation fa cilities (iMK1b, Hagen 2017).  These 
and the government usage descriptions highlight an issue raised by interviewees: that the 
upstream activity of data gathering and processing and visualisation is fairly quick, easy and 
“clean” in terms of local politics ; but ensuring downstream use of the data let alone actual 
results is much more difficult, time -consuming, costly and “dirty” (iMK1a, iSKK, iTC1).  Data 
intermediary organisations must identify potential users; build links and trust with them 
over time, se eking to persuade them of the value of new data; work alongside them during 
often -protracted and politicised sequences and iterations of decision making; and then not 
merely monitor results but have the power to act if implementation falls short of plans 
(iSKK, iTC1, iTC2, Hagen 2011).  
 
1D4. Structural Data Justice  
 
There is evidence of some level of structural determinism in the case studies: of these pro -
equity initiatives to still reflect structural inequalities, and for data to flow along the fault -
lines of power in society.  
 
A consistent theme across all initiatives was that operation of the full information value 
chain depended on whether or not the data had utility for powerful local actors; particularly 
those in local government.  In Solo, the mini -atlases became an officially -mandated part of 
participatory budgeting because Mayor Widodo wanted his urban development innovations 
to work (iSKK, Bunnell et al 2013).  By contrast, government officials in Pune were resistant 
to the participatory budgeting process, making it much harder for new data to be utilised 
(iOPOB1, Jobst & Malherbe 2017).  
 
In relation to institutional forces, formal control of urban development decision processes 
rested with external agencies; particularly local government.  Hence, i t was their perception 
of the utility of that data which determined whether or not it would be used, in what Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
28 
 manner and to what end.  Data also flowed according to the topography of trust in the city.  
Notwithstanding examples of government officials chang ing their view of the assets and 
issues in slum areas, they still tended to mistrust those communities (iSKK, iTC3).  At best, 
substantial investment in advocacy and “bridge -building” activities by the data 
intermediaries was required to enable those offic ials to use the data provided; but at worst, 
even this did not stop officials from devaluing data about the community and being 
reluctant to use it.  
 
All four initiatives were funded to a significant degree by international donors. That control 
of resource s meant the initiatives were shaped by the agenda of those donors, which were 
for highly -visible, short -term results (iMK2, iTC1, Hagen 2017).  This meant activity in all 
projects was a right -skewed distribution curve with rapid early growth but then taili ng off to 
much lower levels that struggled to sustain (iMK2, iTC1).  And it meant an upstream —
downstream disconnect: donors would pay for production of data artefacts, especially 
physical and digital maps, but were much less interested in paying for the lo nger -term, less -
visible activity of getting that data used to change urban decisions; in particular, not funding 
use of data by communities themselves (iMK1b, iOPOB2).  
 
Conversely, the lack of resources among community members – mainly their financial 
pove rty but also lack of knowledge and skills – shaped their engagement with the PEDIs.  For 
many it meant non -engagement because of the opportunity cost that time invested in the 
project was time lost from earning a livelihood.  So people: did not respond to requests for 
data, did not join in mapping of their community, did not engage in community use of data 
(Grillos 2017, Hagen 2017, Jobst & Malherbe 2017).  And where they did engage, they 
brought an instrumental rather altruistic agenda; thus Map Kibera map pers came forward 
because the work was paid and even volunteer mappers were focused on the skill - and job 
opportunity -developments the work could offer (iMK1b, Berdou 2011, Lundine et al 2012).  
 
Structural relations were most often understood in terms of t he relation between state and 
citizens.  For Map Kibera, the state’s monopoly of legitimate violence had shaped data use.  
They avoided “provocative” uses of data that might antagonise state actors and lead to 
“vengeance” (iMK1b).  For example, they did no t gather or use data relating to housing 
demolitions and evictions.  They saw this would potentially lead to protests that would be 
violently suppressed by the authorities and – reflecting state control over NGOs – lead to 
Map Kibera Trust being shut down.   For Transparent Chennai, the lack of accountability of 
state institutions to citizens shaped data use.  As an example, the local Slum Clearance 
Board and Water Corporation had no elected representatives, no public hearings, no open 
reporting policies (iT C1, iTC2).  As a result, there were no incentives for them to change their 
practices and make use of new streams of community data.  
 
Finally, in terms of epistemics, the strength of smart -city discourse shapes outcomes.  With 
its emphasis on data and techn ology, it drives the idea among funders and other 
stakeholders that an upstream focus will be sufficient; that the addition of digital 
technologies into urban processes is enough to deliver urban development (iMK1b, Shekhar 
2016).  This makes it more diffi cult to engage funds and actors in the more difficult aspects 
of downstream processes and socio -political factors.  
 Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
29 
 On the “input” side, then, there was evidence of structural determinism but looking at the 
“output” side this was not quite a story of full path dependency.  No social structure is 
stable and, while there was substantial reproduction of the structures of power, datafication 
had enabled some incremental changes to the architecture of urban development, as 
discussed next.  
 
Regarding utility, the re are always competing agendas and interests in any urban 
development setting.  The new data streams from the PEDIs assist those looking to make 
more open and/or more objective decisions6.  Interests in openness were rarely found: it 
applied only and to only some degree to the mayoralty of Joko Widodo in Solo (Bunnell et al 
2013).  There were more interests in objectivity: an occasional presence in local government 
in Pune and Chennai; more strongly felt by external development agencies such as UNICEF 
and GOAL working with Map Kibera (iMK1b, iOPOB1, iTC2, Hagen 2017).  And data itself – 
via its advocacy use by data intermediary organisations, local NGOs and local media and/or 
via concerns that urban decisions were visible to a wider world – could modify th e perceived 
interests of decision -makers, nudging them in a few cases and temporarily towards greater 
concern for slum residents (iSKK, iTC1, Kovacic & Lundine 2013).  
 
Institutional change was minor: in formal terms, the only regulatory change was the Solo 
mini -atlas incorporation; there were no examples of legal recognition of rights to land or 
even occupancy.  In informal terms, there was some trust -building but less between citizens 
and government direct than between some community members and the da ta intermediary 
organisation; and then between the intermediary and some government officials.  
Structurally, too, insertion of the data intermediary into the landscape was the most notable 
feature – acting as that trust -building bridge, translating episte mes and logics, to some 
degree equalising the power inequalities between citizens and outside agencies (iMK1b, 
iTC3, Song 2016).  But these intermediating relations were contingent: broken off or 
downgraded, for example, when new government officials came into office (iOPOB1, iTC3).  
And they were bounded.  There were “no -go” areas that were deemed too politically -
sensitive, for example if touching on corruption (iTC1, Swain 2012).  They could have been 
the basis for holding state and other actors to accoun t except, as noted, data on actions and 
results – on the extent to which new infrastructure, services and resources were being 
delivered into the slums – was not being gathered (iTC2, Menon 2013, Feruglio & Rifai 
2017).  
 
Epistemic change was also bounded.  Communities to some extent, and external actors to a 
greater extent, had better knowledge of these informal settlements.  We noted evidence of 
“slum imaginaries” of some of those external actors changing to a more positive view.  But 
negative images persi sted, at least among some local government officials (iTC3, Menon 
2013).  
 
Lastly, the key resource change is the availability of data.  There were barriers to this flowing 
to slum residents; having to be converted to a less -valuable analogue (i.e. paper -based) 
form due to lack of access to digital technologies within slums.  Meanwhile, being open and

and more objective than previous data that matters here.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
30 
 digital, it flowed more readily to others outside the community.  And as a usable resource, it 
favoured those with the other resources – skills, knowledge, tim e, confidence, money – 
necessary to make the value chain operate; resources which the marginalised community 
lacked.  The impact of that use could benefit the community: the data intermediaries 
empowered to better advocacy on behalf of communities; the int ernational NGOs 
empowered to planning better interventions.  But control and empowerment still resided 
outside the community.  In particular, it is the data intermediary organisations that are 
empowered – interrogating openness, one finds that it is often sub-sets or summaries or 
visualisations of data that are being circulated.  Control over the foundational dataset 
including ownership and rights to update typically rests with the data intermediaries.  
 
 
1E. Discussion and Conclusions  
 
1E1. Distributive Dat a Justice  
 
Distributive data justice – the concern for who gets what as a result of data systems – is a 
lens applied across the other dimensions (see Figure 1).  It has particular relevance here 
given the foundational concern about marginalisation, and the  injustices of data -based 
inequality suffered by the slum communities: their location, assets, issues are less visible 
than those of more affluent areas and residents, with a knock -on to inequality of 
infrastructure, service provision and political role.  
 
Procedurally, the overall picture could be seen as a pyramid.  At the base, the majority of 
community members are not involved in the data -information -decision -action processes of 
the information value chain.  Above them, the largest number of beneficiarie s are within the 
community but gain only the interpretive value of data; the mappers who capture data are 
far fewer but gain more; the midstream professionals are fewer still but gain greater 
capabilities; and the intermediary organisations benefit most of  all. 
 
A similar picture can be seen in terms of visibility.  The most marginalised – those without 
homes, those without identification, those residing on the physical margins who come in to 
the city to make their living – are rarely made visible by these data initiatives.  Conversely, 
data that might truly challenge political elites e.g. enabling them to be held to account, 
remained largely invisible.  The communities which are made visible reap some benefit 
directly but they lose control of their represen tation; becoming legible to others who can 
make use of the community’s data twin for their own purposes.  From this, we can see the 
ambivalence of legibility.  Slums must be legible to government, NGOs, development 
agencies, etc if they are to benefit from  the resources, services, support, etc that these 
external organisations offer.  But that same legibility exposes slum residents to any other 
agendas these organisations may hold; agendas that may be orthogonal to slum interests or 
even counter to those in terests: extractive, persecutory or predatory.  Even if direct 
evidence of the latter was limited, the fear of it led some data intermediaries to avoid 
gathering certain types of data, and led some groups to prioritise their right to privacy and 
either res ist or refuse to engage with data gathering.  
 Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
31 
 External agendas have served the slums: these data initiatives bring better -planned and 
more resources and services.  But alongside the glass half -full is a glass half -empty.  These 
absolute improvements are al ways less than intended or needed, and sometimes merely 
symbolic or temporary.  Marginalised groups find some greater voice and place in urban 
decision making than previously thanks to these data initiatives.  But, particularly in city -
wide initiatives as in Pune and Solo, relative inequality still grows as more formalised areas 
and wealthier residents retain a stronger voice and benefit more.  
 
This overall picture is both explained by and reflected in the structural data justice evidence.  
Path dependency is the main narrative: the wider structural inequalities of power -interest 
significantly shape the data systems and operations of the information value chain.  In turn, 
the value chain largely reproduces that wider configuration and constrains pro -equity 
aspirations.  This is not a completely static picture: the value chain does reshape – subtly, 
incrementally – the structural determinants of power and utility.  There is an incremental 
empowerment in terms of new data access, external perceptions of self -interest and of 
slums and their residents, and the landscape of organisations and trust.  But there is no 
evidence of a wider transformation of the substrates of urban inequality, with communities 
potentially more dependent on external forces as a result of their heightened legibility.  
 
1E2. Conclusions and Recommendations  
 
Datafication is a key trend within international development; with effects seen in every 
development sector and effects growing every day.  Yet analysis of real -world experiences 
and their  breadth of impact has to date been limited; in part due to a lack of analytical 
frameworks.  
 
This paper therefore makes two significant contributions.  First, it exposes a full picture of 
the impact of one type of pro -equity data initiative – community ma pping – on those who 
are marginalised within the city.  New data flows do have an impact but disproportionately 
serve those with the motivation and power to use that data.  Results are certainly beneficial 
for slum communities and other marginalised citize ns, and these initiatives can be justified 
on that basis.  However, though there can be no exact calibration from qualitative research, 
it is likely that these pro -equity initiatives actually increase relative inequalities.  Ordinary 
community members have  seen some benefits but external actors who find the data to 
match their agenda and capabilities, benefit more.  It is the latter who are more empowered 
to access, use and control the new data.  
 
Second, and in order to perform this evaluation, the paper presents and demonstrates an 
explicit, systematic and comprehensive framework for the analysis of data systems and 
initiatives.  The framework is data -based: acknowledging the important growth in both 
reality and discourse around datafication by plac ing data at the heart of the model.  But it 
simultaneously decentres data and digital technology by guiding attention to wider 
processes, impacts and structures.  There was some overlap in the dimensions used; with 
the rights discussion particularly touchi ng on procedural, instrumental and structural issues.  
However, in general the perspectives were additive; offering new insights and particularly 
substantiating the need to incorporate and understand context – rights, structures, interests 
– in order to fu lly understand the implications of datafication.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
32 
  
The framework was applied here to analyse just one type of data initiative.  It should be 
equally applicable to all types of datafication – urban and otherwise – but that application 
must form part of a fut ure research agenda.  Another part will be action research; working 
with data intermediary and other organisations in using the framework to guide design and 
implementation of data initiatives.  In advance of that, one can – building from Fox (2015) – 
iden tify three approaches to pro -equity data initiatives: technical, social and critical.  
 
A technical approach focuses just on the digital data and technology, and the findings here 
show this to be too limited a view that falls short both in terms of conceptu alisation and 
impact.  A social approach focuses on achievement of development results.  Findings here 
suggest such an approach should recognise the procedural benefits that can emerge 
alongside instrumental results.  And they suggest that such projects ne ed a clear theory of 
change, with the information value chain providing the basis for that.  Project design can 
either look for or seek to create a functioning information value chain; one that has utility as 
its driver and the necessary resources present as enablers.  
 
A critical approach would encompass the wider context of rights, power and interests.  The 
findings suggest value in modesty of expectations for what can be achieved through pro -
equity data initiatives; accepting incremental rather than trans formational outcomes; 
accepting absolute improvements in informal settlements, even if broader inequalities may 
widen.  They highlight the importance of identifying tensions and disjunctures within the 
context: seeking out NGOs that see an advantage over o thers within the competitive 
funding environment if they make use of new or more -objective data; looking for newly -
appointed mayors or urban commissioners or development agency directors who bring a 
new agenda that new or more -objective data could be seen to assist.  And they highlight the 
important structural role performed by data intermediary organisations: as channels 
through which citizens can influence the balance of representation/privacy and the nature 
of data ownership and access; as important dete rminants of the constitution and 
distributive benefits of information value chains.  
 
More generally, the findings support the value of imbuing data projects with the values of 
data justice; ensuring their design and implementation follow principles of proc edural, 
rights -based, instrumental, structural and distributive justice.  Such principles may be found, 
for example, in the “Data -Justice -for-Development Manifesto”  (see Box 1; Heeks 2017b).  
These can be a guiding framework, particularly for data intermed iary organisations given 
they are focal nodes for emancipatory action.

 Case 2: Visual Data Justice?  
Datafication of Urban Informality in South 
Africa Using 360° Imaging Technologies

University of Exeter   
 
 
Abstract  
 
Uneven economic development is closely associated with the proliferation of informal 
settlements in the global South, a process generally understood to harbour injustices 
according to a resource access view of society. An understanding of social justice in  terms of 
distribution provides a powerful framework for challenging uneven development, however, 
a key contention of this paper is that further forms of injustice accrue to the residents of 
these places over and above issues of distribution. With its focu s on sociocultural 
representations, recognition provides a basis for ‘making visible’ further injustices that 
threaten dignity and self -identification, which may also act as a preliminary step towards 
advancing socioeconomic justice for informal settlement s. 
 
This paper draws on ongoing research into the datafication of informal settlements in South 
Africa, including interviews with data activists and experiences of conducting a 360° 
geovisual imagery pilot study in Kya Sands informal settlement in Johannesburg . In first 
drawing attention to the limitations of quantitative data for representing injustice, and the 
problematic effects of conventional framed photographs of informality from aerial and 
ground -level perspectives, this paper explores the possibilities of ground -level 360° imagery 
as a realist, non -reductionist form of representation for informal settlements. Three 360° 
street views were produced to illustrate key possibilities and limitations for advancing 
recognition, based on the notion that visibilit y is essential for recognition. Further, the piece 
reflexively critiques how – through new advancements in image analytics – informal 
settlement visibility projects risk further engendering injustices of misrecognition for these 
highly marginalized urba n spaces.  
 
As such, this paper provides a basis for further inquiry into the relationship between visual 
data and the social justice principle of recognition, towards an emerging research agenda on 
visual data justice . The paper concludes with recommendations  for practitioners and key 
topics for research . Import ant items on the agenda include:  determining the  forms and 
examples of injustice that can be remedied through datafication, the relationship between 
misrecognition and maldistribution in the context of datafication, and the acceleration of 
new injustices due to advances in computer vision applied to ground -level imagery.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88

 2A. Introduction  
 
“In contemporary discussions, recognition is often accompanied by visibility as its 
political partner. Demands for r ecognition are also demands for visibility ” (Oliver, 
2001, p.147)  
 
Uneven development is a  significant challenge to cities around the world, particularly in low - 
and middle -income countries with extreme levels of socioeconomic inequality. In many 
global South cities, recent patterns of urbanization and inward migration have produced a 
highly va riegated and disconnected urban fabric. Nowhere is this more evident than in 
South Africa, where the world’s highest rates of inequality and uneven development are 
both a consequence of current socioeconomic injustices and a resolutely visible  reminder of 
past apartheid racial policies. The longstanding and intransigent nature of uneven urban 
development means that injustice is often defined in specifically spatial terms in South 
Africa. However, as data becomes a key focus of urban governance in the countr y, injustice 
is also increasingly understood in the context of datafication, which draws attention to how 
uneven patterns of data render marginalized spaces and their inhabitants invisible  to 
outsiders.  
 
Cities in South Africa actively pursue datafication discourses and ‘smart’ agendas in the 
globally circulating model (Odendaal, 2015) ; however for residents and grassroots 
organizati ons in Cape Town and Johannesburg, data has also become a means by which 
everyday injustices can be ‘made visible’ (Odendaal, 2006)  in a country with a complex 
politics of visibility that requires one to be “‘seen by  the state’ before benefitting from it” 
(Parnell and Pieterse, 2010, p.153) . Data activism has emerged in this context as a strategy 
to contest disparities in the provision of basic services guaranteed by the country’s rights -
based constitution, including water, sanitation, housing, and education. Quantitative, 
evidence -driven ac tivism provides an alternative or supplement to the widespread 
deployment of ‘service delivery’ protests by civil society organizations and residents of 
informal settlements, which can often be ignored by municipal governments. Growing 
interest in data act ivism suggests a tactical shift from the legacy of ‘people power’ in South 
Africa (Bénit -Gbaffou, 2015) , to a new focus on ‘data power’ (Kennedy and Bates, 2017)  
based on an understanding of data as a powerful actor that can inform effective governance 
and policy decisions.  
 
In the context of datafication in governance, busin ess, and wider society, ‘data justice’ (e.g. 
Dencik et al., 2016; Taylor, 2017; Heeks and Renken, 2018)  has emerged as a field of theory 
and praxis that broadly seeks to draw attention to the complex ways that data and social 
justice are interwoven. This includes efforts to trace how data production, accumulation and 
analytics (re)produce social injustice (Cinnamon, 2017; Redden, 2018) , and work that 
actively engages with these practi ces towards the advancement of normative social justice 
aims, such as emancipation, empowerment, equity, and fairness (Johnson, 2014; Milan and 
van der Velden, 2016) . Engaging both of these dimensions, this piece adds to the literature 
on data justice in two ways. First, the piece develops the notion of visual data justice for 
advancing the social justice principle of ‘recognition’ (Honneth, 2004; Fraser, 2008) . Justice -
as-recognition provides a means of identifying and contesting injustices other than those 
that arise as a consequence of socioeconomic inequalities, the primary target of distributive Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
39 
 social justice reparat ions. Instead, as a sociocultural consideration, recognition is concerned 
with the ability to self -identify and to participate as an equal in society. Although economic 
inequities are important in this context, a focus here on spatial recognition  foregroun ds the 
more -than -economic causes and consequences of urban marginality. Doing so 
acknowledges that while urban spatial injustices are clearly aligned with patterns of uneven 
economic development, further forms of injustice accrue to the residents of these places 
over and above inadequate provision of basic services. Thus, making injustices of 
misrecognition visible can be a first step towards remedying injustices of maldistribution.  
 
This project was undertaken in Kya Sands, an informal settlement on the no rthern periphery 
of Johannesburg. An effectively invisible space unrecorded and unaccounted for in official 
maps, databases, and archives, Kya Sands is known to outsiders primarily though visual 
imagery depicting extreme poverty and hardship (see Figure 1) . Taken from above or at a 
considerable distance, these forms of imagery serve as a symbolic representation that 
further marginalizes the residents of these spaces (Hecker, 2010; Dovey and King, 2011) . 
The aim of this project was to ‘make visible’ the settlement in a  very literal, panoramic way 
that might overcome some of the limitations and harms of conventionally -framed images. 
Further, the project is driven by a more general critique of datafication in contexts of 
informality – that quantitative data are inadequate  for representing injustice in its full 
texture. Three research questions guide this paper:  
• What is the role of quantitative data in representing injustice and advancing the 
needs of marginalized people and places?  
• How can consumer -grade 360° imaging techn ologies be used to produce street -level 
imagery of informal settlements?  
• Can a potentially more progressive form of datafication be realised through street -
level 360° imagery?

and image of a fire taken from a low -oblique aerial perspective.  
 
To answer the first question, the paper draws on interviews with ‘data activists’ working in 
informal settlements in Johannesburg and Cape Town. Experiences of conducting the s treet -
level imagery pilot study in Kya Sands are used to answer the next two questions.  
 
The following section provides a background and conceptual framework for the paper. The 
Methods section explains the study site and data collection activities. The Findings and 
Discussion section initially provides the results of the interviews and pilot s tudy. Through an 
Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
40 
 exploration of three street views produced about the community, this section then develops 
the notion of visual data justice, by tracing the possibilities, limitations, and risks of 360° 
imagery for advancing recognition for invisible urba n spaces. This piece concludes with 
recommendations for practitioners interested in using 360° imagery for informal settlement 
representation, and a consideration of the future research agenda for visual data justice in 
light of this project.  
 
 
2B. Background  
 
2B1. Urban Fragmentation and Invisibility  
In global South cities, new urban dwellers often take up residence in informal settlements 
on the outskirts of cities, extending municipal boundaries outward, or infilling interstitial 
spaces along tran sport infrastructure routes, on land unsuitable for formal structures, or 
other underused or unwanted urban spaces (Dovey and King, 2011) . The notion of urban 
informal settlements as ‘fragments’ (McFarlane, 2018)  both separate from and intimately 
interconnected with the city draws attention to their highly dynamic, shifting, and 
heterogeneous spatial arrangement both in ternally and in re lation to the surrounding city.  
 
While the spatial contours of fragmented spaces can be ascertained with relative ease, 
often little is known about the internal spatial structure of informal settlements nor of the 
people who live there. F or municipal governments, lack of information on informal 
settlements on the one hand presents an opportunity to ignore the needs of these spaces, 
and on the other, a significant challenge when intervention is necessary. For residents of 
informal settlemen ts, life in an urban fragment is similarly ambivalent. Informal settlement 
living is often defined by precarity and a sense of invisibility and disconnection from the rest 
of the city. These spaces generally have few municipal, social, or health services p rovided, 
and residents working or enrolled in school or university are often required to travel 
considerable distances. Yet dis -integration from the wider urban fabric may have positive 
implications for residents seeking affordable temporary shelter or to avoid being caught up 
in the machinery of the state.  
 
2B2. The Datafication of Injustice in Informal Settlements  
Advancements in digital technologies and data production have opened up new 
opportunities to ‘know’ informal settlements. The term ‘dataficatio n’ is often described as a 
process  of “rendering into data aspects of the world not previously quantified” (Kennedy et 
al., 2015, p.1) , although it is also profitably interrogated in terms of the wider beliefs and 
motivations underlying data  and data analytics. Van Dijck’s (2014)  notion of ‘dataism’ 
captures the discursive underpinnings of datafication based on an understanding of 
quantitative data as an objective representation of the world, and also a tool of action and 
change. Beer (2019)  draws attention to a ‘data imaginary’ that frames data analytics as 
speedy (rapid insights), accessible (easily interpreted), revealing (ex tracting hidden 
knowledge), panoramic (all -seeing), prophetic (able to foresee and shape the future), and 
smart (p ossessing latent intelligence).  
 Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88

 In the case of urban data and the wider smart urbanism agenda, data and data analytics are 
thusly pursued by governments as the solution for urban challenges. As Kitchin explains, 
smart city advocates believe that data “provides the raw material for envisioning and 
enacting more efficient, sustainable, competitive, productive, open and transparent cities” 
(2014, p.1) . For urban residents and civil society organizations, similar beliefs about data 
and data analytics are powering new modes of data -driven civic action, taking advantage of 
accessible data production technologies (e.g. mobile phones) and processes (e.g. 
crow dsourcing, citizen science). As part of this wider phenomenon, diverse forms of ‘data 
activism’ have emerged in cities around the globe, including in South Africa. Data activism 
demonstrates an ambivalent resist/embrace relationship with datafication – as Milan and 
van der Velden explain, the term comprises both “affirmative engagement with data and 
resistance to massive data collection” (2016, p.6 1). 
 
Informed by wider datafication discourses, efforts to address urban invisibility through 
datafication have come in two main forms. The first, on -the-ground mapping and surveying 
initiatives with varying degrees of local resident participation, is e xemplified by the Map 
Kibera project in Nairobi (Donovan, 2012) . This initiative engaged local residents to produce 
spatial data and thematic maps (e.g. location of hospitals, points of interest, perceptions of 
safety) of this huge informal settlement in Nairobi which was previously unmapped and 
largely ignored, despite being home to as many as 1 million people. In South Africa, one 
form of data activism called a ‘social audit’ has gained widespread uptake within th e activist 
communities in Johannesburg and Cape Town. Social audits are collaborative data collection 
initiatives between an organization and local residents which aim to draw attention to 
inadequate service provision. Since 2013, over a dozen social audit s have been undertaken, 
collecting data on infrastructure, services, and hazards in informal settlements, highlighting 
gaps between expected allocations and the reality on the ground (Social Audit Network, 
2016) . 
 
A second  form of datafication for informal settlements uses aerial remote sensing to 
capture imagery for conversion into spatial data  – the ‘slums from space’ approach (Kuffer 
et al., 201 6). While satellite imagery has a long history of use for mapping cities, unmanned 
aerial vehicles (UAVs) present new opportunities for mapping these dense and highly 
dynamic spaces in much higher spatial and temporal resolution. For instance, Gevaert  et al. 
(2017)  used UAV imagery to algorithmically classify informal sett lements for the purposes of 
upgrading, and Mansell (2018)  described the use of DIY balloon -based aerial imagin g 
techniques in a Palestinian refugee camp to assert residents’ ‘right to the city’. With both 
approaches however, datafication of informal settlements based only on aerial imagery has 
practical limitations in terms of what can be known about these spaces.  It can provide proxy 
estimates of socioeconomic conditions (e.g. population size, deprivation), but is primarily 
used only for the production of geospatial framework data (e.g. vector datasets of roads, 
paths, building footprints, spatial boundaries) (Williams et al., 2016; Mahabir et al., 2018) . 
 
Critics of mapping and quantitative data have long drawn attention to the way these forms 
of representation shape a limited and partial understanding of the world (e.g. Harley, 1989; 
Crampton, 2001; Aalbers, 2014) . For many femin ist and diversity theorists, quantitative 
representation serves to advance the interests of those people and things that are more 
readily captured by numbers, static categories, and hegemonic forms of knowledge (e.g. Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
42 
 Lawson, 1995) . In a study of participatory efforts to include Rio de Janeiro’s favelas  in 
Google Maps, Luque -Ayala and Neves Maya observed considerable “distance between the 
richn ess of the mental map of favela dwellers and the spatial simplification and 
standardization required by the global digital map” (2019, p.456) . With this understanding, 
quantitative representation will have only limited use for capturing the dynamics and lived 
realities of life on the ground in informal se ttlements, which calls into question a variety of 
data -led strategies that seek to advance justice through datafication.  
 
2B3. Visualizing Informality: Vertical, Oblique, Horizontal  
Against this backdrop, constructivist and interpretivist forms of knowledg e production are 
also undertaken in an effort to more accurately ‘know’ informal spaces, including 
interviews, participatory methods, and ethnographic research. Within this epistemological 
framing, visual imagery is advanced as a way to represent informal settlements with a 
degree of objectivity, while avoiding the abstractions of quantification. The privileging of 
imagery as an instrument of empirical fact is based on a “naturalistic understanding of vision 
[which] claims that objectivity is achieved by a correspondence between an image and its 
external referent” (Campbell, 2007, p.379) . This linking of seeing with knowing facilitates 
the now widespread use of aerial images as evidence of on -the-ground conditions, even 
without converting the imagery to quantitative spatial vector data. The power of vertical 
aeria l images (see Figure 2a) to enable access to remote locations without local grounding 
provides new opportunities to know these spaces, but they also serve to reinforce power 
asymmetries with other peoples and cultures, through the subjectifying and dominat ing 
effects of the ‘god’s eye view’ (Parks, 2009) . 
 
Tilting the camera angle from the vertical (nadir) plane of perspective of most satellite 
imagery to an oblique (angled) perspective has become common, especially with the 
advancement of UAVs. Oblique imagery is generally not used to produce quantitative vector 
data, since the scale of the imagery is different from the image’s foreground to background, 
meaning distance and direction vary. Beyond these practical limitations, oblique imagery 
can have powerful effects in terms of how spaces are understood, di stinct from the effects 
of vertical imagery’s powerful downward gaze. The ‘high -oblique’ perspective tilts the 
camera angle to a midway point between nadir and ground -level horizontal, providing the 
viewer with both a sense of size and context, as well as local detail and nuance. But the 
‘low -oblique’ perspective tilts the camera to a point that captures the ground at around 30° 
off the nadir view but excludes the horizon altogether (see Figure 2b). This subtle 
adjustment to the plane of perspective produce s imagery that captures the scale of the 
settlements but excludes the anchoring point of the horizon. As Hecker (2010)  explains, this 
limits the potential for documentary realism – the effect on the viewer is to depoliticize 
informality and povert y, offering only abstraction and aestheticization7 of the social realities 
below : 
“the oblique aerial view uses the horizon to seam together the void of the sky and 
the full of the distant landscape. But what happens when the plane of sight turns 
 
7 Here, aestheticization is understood as a process in conflict with politicization . For visual imagery,  particular artistic elements 
and decisions can serve to neuter the political potential of representation . Through such a process , politics and power relations 
“are obscured, becoming incorporated into categories of lifestyle, taste, and patterns of consumption and appreciation of the 
visual, the sensual, and the unique”  (Duncan and Duncan 2001, p.377). This draws  in particular  on Walter Benjamin’s notion of 
the ‘aestheticization of politics ’, as well as ideas about the political potential of represen tation developed in the field of  visual 
studies . Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
43 
 toward the ground to bracket off the horizon itself?  … This low -oblique plane of 
vision ref ocuses the dialectic between immensity and an ordering line of sight, away 
from optics of stability and order toward the immensity of the ground below. This 
technique of closing off the horizon… could also be seen to occupy another 
interstitial position — existing in between the lofty god -powers of the vertical 
omniscient view and the horizontal comfort of being in the world” (Hecker, 2010, 
p.260) . 
 
Further tilting the camera lens down to ground -level, the horizontal plane of perspe ctive 
offers a form of visuality that may be more attuned to the politics and lived realities of those 
living in informal settlements (see Figure 2c). As Dodge explains, “the action of tilting the 
camera through 90 degrees and the reduction of verticality can be read as a move from the 
disembodied ‘view from nowhere’ to a more human -scale and embodied sense of place” 
(2018, p.955) . Taken at the scale  of the social, and at a vantage point closer to the subject 
matter, conventional ground -level photography provides an opportunity for documentary 
realism that captures the realities of informal settlement living in a way that illustrates 
injustice but neg ates ab straction and aestheticization.  
 
Yet Linke (2012)  describes how ground -level informal settlement photography is often itself 
an idealist art form, consumed by global elites drawn in by a carefully -crafted aesthetic of  
resourcefulness and sustainability that occludes the social disadvantage that a more realist 
approach might exude. As the author explains, “the conditions of displacement and the 
impact of poverty on families or communities are expunged from the visual fi eld by 
transforming poverty artefacts into aestheticized art objects” (p.303 -304) . The ability to 
shape a slum imaginary of ‘bare life’ (Agamben, 1998)  liberated of any political meaning is 
made possible through the process of ‘framing’. Frames are a necessary, thou gh powerful 
and performative aspect of photographs, whether the plane of perspective is nadir, oblique, 
or horizontal. Framing is an act of inclusion and exclusion; as Judith Butler puts it, it is a 
“delimiting function, bringing into focus an image on the  condition that some portion of the 
visual field is ruled out” (2007, p.953) . Choosing the frame and linear perspective 
determines the arrangement of objects and composition of the photograph, which, as 
Cosgrove explains, “determines – in both senses – the ‘point of view’ to be taken by the 
observer, and … the scope of reality revealed” (1985, p.48) .

Through avoiding the need to frame the visual field and allowing the viewer to choose the 
visual perspective, developme nts in 360° photography suggest  new possibilities for visually 
representing informal settlements, and a potential move away from aestheticization and 
abstraction towards realist representation (see Figure 3).

Google Street View (GSV) is “practically synonymous” (Alvarez León and Quinn, 2019, p.2)  
with 360° street -level representation in most settings. GSV was initially released in 2007 in 5 
cities in the US, and since has expanded to all continents, however the platform’s coverage 
is both spatially and temporally uneven. GSV first visited the African continent in advance of 
the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. A decade later, much of the imagery collected from 
more marginalized areas of Cape Town and Johannesburg has yet to be update d, meaning 
users of GSV are presented with an inaccurate representation of these highly dynamic and 
mutable urban spaces. In contrast, regular updating is standard procedure in many places in 
the global North. For Kya Sands and many informal settlements in  South Africa and beyond, 
coverage is generally absent altogether. The landscape of 360° imagery production is rapidly 
expanding however, spurred on by new actors producing imagery for the autonomous 
vehicle market, the recent availability of low -cost cons umer grade cameras and software, 
and the development of alternative platforms for hosting this imagery outside of GSV 
(Alvarez León and Quinn,  2019) . Since 2013, 360° photo/video cameras have become widely 
available, from entry -level models that attach to a smart phone, higher spec versions for 
outdoor sports, to professional grade models used in industry.8 
 
2B4. From Socioeconomic to Socioc ultural Injustice in Informal Settlements  
The social justice principle of ‘recognition’ provides the framework for analysis of this case 
study. Depending on the nuances of how the principle is interpreted, recognition describes a 
form of justice bound up i n contestations over social status and identity at the level of 
individuals and societal groups, based on the belief that “human dignity comprises a central 
principle of social justice” (Honneth, 2004, p.352) . An inte rest in recognition arose in the 
1990s as justice theorists identified the limitations in the prevailing normative focus of social 
justice, distribution. Associated in particular with the influential work of John Rawls (1971) , 
distributive justice efforts often identify injustices in society resulting from the unequal 
allocation of ‘goods’ and ‘bads’ in society, which could be as broad as income, resources, 
rights, and freedoms, but in practice, material resources and economic wealth are the most 
widely recognized focus of distributive justice reparations (Miller, 1999) . Justice -as-
recognition provides a framework for identifying and addressing forms of injustice 
associated with sociocultural processes of indignity, disrespect, and stigmatization , which

 might be related to issues of distributive injustice, but which manifest as status inequalities 
and threats to agency and identity formation (see Fraser and Honneth, 2003) . 
 
Misrecognition then is the paradigmatic injustice under this principle. For Honneth’s 
identity -based model, t o be misrecognized by others is a threat to self -realization, 
autonomy, and the development of an intact identity (Honneth, 2004) . Here, 
(mis)recognition is produced in intersubjective relations, through (lack of) “respect in the 
political sp here, esteem in the social sphere, and care in the intimate sphere of the family” 
(Kompridis, 2007, p.278) . Alternatively, for Fraser’s status -based model, to be misrecognized 
is a threat to parity of participation in social life caused by institutionalized patterns of 
subordination (Fraser, 2005) . In this interpretation, misrecognition aligns with and is 
connected to distributive justice in its focus on inequality – misrecogniti on produces uneven 
patterns of societal participation, which could mirror or supplement uneven allocations of 
material resources. Although the two models have been said to be incompatible, Thompson 
(2009)  explains how the ability to participate as an equal in society can be understood as a 
necessary element to achieving identity recognition in the eyes of others. Thus,  full 
recognition can be achieved by designing institutions and opportunities that ensure parity of 
participation, which will set up the parameters of a society that fosters relationships of 
dignity and respect, ensuring self -realization for all identity g roups.  
 
Irrespective of a focus on status equality, identity, or their interconnections, misrecognition 
is understood as a deeply embedded injustice that impacts marginalized individuals, groups, 
and indeed places , over and above distributive forms of injustice. V isual imagery plays an 
important role in shaping who is recognized, and who recognizes. Whether aerial or at 
ground -level, techniques of framing and linear perspective in conventional photographs are 
performative acts of misrecognition, accelerating the ‘o thering’ of already marginalized 
people and places. Campbell (2007, p.359)  explains the symbolic potency of photographs of 
the Darfur conflict for how outsiders imagine Africa – not as a vast continent with a diversity 
of landscapes and people but  as “a single entity marked by an iconography of despair, 
disaster and disease ”. 
 
At the urban scale, conventional photography can contribute to the symbolic  discrediting of 
places, as part of a specifically geographic process of misrecognition referred to as 
territorial, or spatial stigma (Wacquant et al., 2014) . Like Goffman’s theory of personal 
stigma as ‘spoiled identities’ shaped through intersubjective stereotyping, spatial stigma 
explains the processes by which residents of defamed places come to be regarded by 
outsiders as embodied manifestations of them. As Slater explains, “urban dwellers at the 
bottom of the class structure are discredited and devalued not simply because of their 
poverty, class position, ethnoracial origin, or religious affi liation, but because of the places  
with which they are associated” (2017, p.113) . The effects of this form of misrecognition are  
both physical and material; research has demonstrated how residents of stigmatized places 
face additional health challenges (Tabuchi et al., 2012; Keene and Padilla, 2014)  and 
reduced employment prospects (Kallin and Slater, 2014)  independent of other factors (e.g. 
socioeconomic status) . Visual imagery is central to the advancement of stigmatizing 
discourses about informal settlements, because this is typically the key way that outsiders 
come to know these spaces, diffracted through the power relations, abstractions, and 
aestheticization s inherent to conventional photographic representation.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
47 
  
Recognition is thus intimately bound up with present and historical patterns of differential 
visibility, “which has positioned certain bodies as objects of recognition and granted others 
the power to  confer recognition”, meaning “ [s]truggles for recognition are also struggles for 
visibility ” (Hesford, 2015, p.536 -537, emphasis added) . This paper develops  the concept of 
visual data justice as a way of connecting digital visual representation to recognition, 
foregrounding the power of visual imagery in shaping how people come to understand 
other people and places. Enhanced visibility through visual represen tation provides 
opportunities for neglected and marginalized peoples and places to achieve recognition in 
the eyes of others; however, central to any notion of visual data justice must be an 
understanding that visibility itself is essentially neutral – it is in its intentions, effects, and 
contestations that recognition or misrecognition are advanced. In this paper, this 
understanding of visual data justice is developed through a 360° street -level imagery pilot 
project. Findings described below shed light o n the potential of non -framed visual 
perspectives for advancing recognition, and more generally provide a basis for application of 
the concept to a variety of existing and emerging forms of ground -level visual 
representation.  
 
 
2C. Methods  
 
The empirical e vidence for this piece is drawn from interviews with data activists, and 
experiences of conducting a 360° imagery research project in Kya Sands, Johannesburg. Kya 
Sands is a typical informal settlement in sub-Saharan Africa, with shack housing, limited 
public infrastructure and services, and a presence that is largely invisible in government and 
private sector maps and databases (see Figure 4). The settlement was initially established in 
the early 1990s, and is now home to an estimated 20,000 people. Kya Sa nds is divided into 
four sub -areas (A,B,C,D) located on a combination of private and state -owned land. State 
provision (and maintenance) of services is minimal, including communal water standpipes, 
chemical toilets, and high mast lighting.  
 
Interviews with  over 25 data activists in Johannesburg and Cape Town were conducted to 
gather perspectives on the value of quantitative data for representing and drawing 
attention to service provision needs in informal settlements.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88

while the satellite view shows the basic spatial structure of the settlement. The blue lines 
indicate Google Street View coverage. To the east of Kya Sands is the wealthy suburb of 
Bloubosrand, and to t he west is the Kya Sand industrial area.  
 
 
Next, a 360° imagery pilot study was conducted, as part of a multi -strand, mixed methods 
project involving researchers from universities in Johannesburg and beyond, with varying 
degrees of participation from local  residents and community leaders. The imagery project 
used consumer -grade cameras and software to capture the settlement in 360°. Images were 
taken with a Garmin VIRB360 camera, a mid -range option that features two 180° lenses, 
automatic in -camera image st itching, and a GPS sensor to record geographic coordinates. 
Since the settlement is comprised of narrow paths and rough terrain, imagery was captured 
on foot using a hand held monopod positioned over the photographer’s head, who was 
later edited out.  
 
Imag es were captured over five days in April, September, and October 2017. The aim was to 
capture images at regular intervals throughout all of the paths and common spaces of the 
Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
49 
 settlement, however this was not possible given time constraints and because of c oncerns 
over environmental health conditions in some areas (open waste, dirty water).  A pragmatic, 
ad-hoc strategy was developed, capturing key common spaces in the settlement and larger 
paths. A local resident involved in the larger project accompanied th e photographer, 
assisting with navigation and providing input on the optimal locations to take the 
photographs and appropriate features to record. The project was discussed with several 
groups of community leaders who provided permission for the research. A larger public 
meeting was then held at a local childcare facility to introduce the research team and 
project to the wider community. Our aim was to engage more fully with any interested 
community members; generally there was support for the project howev er there was little 
interest in developing a participatory research design.  
 
Adobe Photoshop was used for minor post -processing tasks, including general imagery 
enhancements and removal of the photographer and monopod using the Polar Coordinates 
projection  and Clone Stamp tool. The next step was to assemble the imagery to produce 
immersive views of the settlement. 360° photos can now be hosted on a small number of 
Web platforms including Facebook and Flickr, but specialized ‘virtual tour’ software is 
requir ed to link the images together for navigation between the images and on an 
accompanying interactive map. The project initially tested three options; two desktop -based 
packages, Panotour Pro from Kolor/GoPro and the open source krpano, and the lightweight 
Roundme web -based platform. Roundme was chosen for its intuitive development 
interface, social web -style sharing and commenting features, integration with a web based 
interactive map (Google Maps), imagery and tour hosting, embedding of tours on blogs and 
websites, and the ability to embed additional text and multimedia to imagery as ‘hotspots’.  
 
 
2D. Findings  and Discussion  
 
The Findings and Discussion section provides the basis for addressing  the three research 
questions: 1) W hat is the role of quantitative data in representing injustice and advancing 
the needs of marginalized people and places? 2) How can consumer -grade 360° imaging 
technologies be used to produce street -level imagery of informal settlements? 3) Can a 
potentially more progressiv e form of datafication be realised through street -level 360° 
imagery?  
 
2D1. Datafication and its Limits for Contesting Injustice  
Informed by distributive notions of social justice and discourses of datafication, 
quantitative, data -driven social audits have  become a key strategy for making uneven 
service provision visible and actionable in informal settlements in South Africa. Interviews 
with a wide variety of activists and civic data champions provide insight into the aims and 
outcomes of data -led activism.  Data activists aim to provide ‘factual’ evidence of spatial 
discrepancies in service provision. One interviewee explained, “we’re not working with, like, 
opinion and subjectivity, well, not necessarily, you know, we’re working with data” 
(Employee, civic data organization). These ‘counter -data’ (Currie et al., 2016; Dalton et al., 
2016; Meng and DiSalvo, 2018)  actions are driven by a belief that policymaking requires 
quantitative evidence. As an interviewee noted, “taking an evidence based approach Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
50 
 enable s us to speak on the same terms as government” (Employee, social auditing 
organization). Quantitative representations of informality are pursued as powerful leverage 
for drawing attention to distributive injustices, as  another interviewee explained:  
“You a re showing them their facts , to say – it’s a fact that you are paying [a 
contractor] to do this and we are saying we don’t see the value for that money. So, 
you need to stop it, or you need to rectify it, or you need to take some people to 
task to make sur e that this money is spent properly” (Interviewee, activist 
organization, emphasis added).  
 
The findings of social audits are highly contested however, and overall, they have had little 
success in convincing policymakers to address the serious issues raise d. Officials have 
challenged and dismissed findings by claiming the results are not a real representation of 
service provision, focusing their critique on technical considerations such as data quality, 
sample size, and suitability of methods (Rossouw, 2015) . An interviewee from an activist 
organization explains the resistance tactics: “[t]here are various ways that they tried to 
undercut a piece of evidence that was actually factually true.  Attack the sender. [Attack] 
your method… And once a powerful figure says ‘that’s not true’, where do you go with 
that?”  
 
A government response to a social audit conducted by the activist organization Equal 
Education (2016)  on school infrastructure sums up the wider official response to social 
audits: “The WCED [Western Cape Education Department] is always open to constructive 
critique  and analysis of how we operate… This critique and analysis should, however, be 
grounded in realism ” (emphasis added).  This government response to social audit findings is 
typical; though initially, the resistance took many activists by surprise. One acti vist described 
his astonishment:  
“I certainly believed this quite naively in the first few years that, if only you can 
prove people wrong in the public domain that, in this war of ideas, you put this 
idea, they put this idea, you tell them that they’re wro ng and then somehow that 
leads to them saying ‘you know what, you’re right, you convinced us and we’re 
going to change what we do here. We had no idea, you’re absolutely right’” 
(Interviewee, activist organization).  
 
Overall, the interviews illustrate how attempts to make injustice visible through quantitative 
evidence have been easily dismissed by governments, with their “greater claims to data” 
(Rossouw, 2015, p.79) . This finding adds further dimensionality to the notion that 
quantitative data may be unsuitable for representing the lived realities and complexities of 
informal settlements. It is not just that quantitative data ar e reductive and shape a partial 
understanding of the world; when produced by the grassroots, quantitative data are also an 
easy target upon which governments can focus their resistance and deflection tactics 
(Cinn amon, forthcoming) . Findings here provided the rationale for the 360° imaging pilot 
study. 360° visual imagery suggests possibilities for digital forms of informal settlement 
representation that may overcome the limitations of quantitative data and conv entionally 
framed imagery, a contention that is considered in detail below.

 2D2. 360° I maging Pilot Study Findings  
The 360° imagery pilot study produced a total of 112 panoramic images of the settlement 
across all four sub -areas (A -D). Selected images w ere used to produce three separate street 
views using the Roundme platform. Figure 5 shows the platform in edit mode, with the 360° 
image viewing panel on the left and the interactive map (Google Map satellite view) 
showing the position of the images on th e right. Navigation between images is possible by 
clicking on the image ribbon, on the links embedded in the 360° images, or on the 
thumbnails on the map. The first street view, the Kya Sands Tour,  was designed as a virtual 
tour of the settlement, starting  from one of the main entry points in to Kya Sands from 
Agnes Ave (see Figure 6 and https://roundme.com/tour/258779/info ). The tour is 
comprised of 27 images from all sub -areas of the settlement. The tou r approximates the 
experience of GSV, although in most places there are larger distances between each image, 
and fewer opportunities to choose the direction to navigate through the settlement.

Figure 6: Entry page for the Kya Sands ‘virtual tour’ street view.  
 
Following the overall aims of those engaging in social audit activism in South Africa, and 
informal discussions with residents about their key concerns about living in Kya Sands, the 
second street view highlights service provision, infrastructural, and env ironmental hazard 
issues in Kya Sands. This Kya Sands - Services and Hazards  street view includes 10 images 
from around the settlement (see https://roundme.com/tour/391902/info ). Images show the 
placement of municipal services including water standpipes, outhouse toilets, and high mast 
lighting, as well as informal electricity connections, open water and waste, a recently 
installed bridge over the stream, and several informal childcare and communi ty facilities.  
 
The third street view was produced to illustrate the nuance and diversity of the settlement, 
highlighting not only hazards and limited infrastructure but also the broader story of Kya 
Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
53 
 Sands. Information gathered from the wider research proj ect, as well as the limited amount 
of information about Kya Sands on the web, were used to compile  the Kya Sands Stor y, 
which made use of Roundme’s interactive ‘hotspot’ functionality to embed text, web links, 
conventional photographs, and videos into the street view’s thirteen 360° images (see 
https://roundme.com/tour/391926/view/1354277/ ). The story  contains various details 
about the settlement, its history, information about its residents, emp loyment and 
entrepreneurial activities, the range of building materials used, and the local markets, 
shops, and community facilities. Rather than using a linear tour structure, no links are 
provided within the imagery, to encourage the user to navigate mor e freely by clicking on 
the image ribbon and map.  
 
2D3. Framing, L inear Perspective, and Visibility in 360°  
Wider access to 360° imagery production provides new opportunities to represent 
marginalized areas that might avoid the consequences of framing and fixed linear 
perspective. Positioned perpendicularly (and imagined oppositionally) to the vertical, 
ground -level 360° imagery offers an alternative to the subjectifying gaze of the nadir 
perspective and the abstractions of low -oblique (see Harris, 2015) , while also enabling the 
viewer to navigate through a full panoramic field of vision. This form of imagery may also 
counter the limitations of quantitative data; as Shapiro (2017, p.2)  explains in the context of 
GSV, “its emphasis on the particularities of place rather than cartographic abstractions of 
space makes it seem progressive, absolved from the visual -semiotics of scientific  rationality 
or objectivity”.  
 
However, as the de facto  platform for 360° urban representation, GSV has additional powers 
that can lead to injustices for urban spaces and the people who live there. GSV is generally 
understood as a “simulation of the city o f the present” (Campkin and Ross, 2012, p.148) , 
however its uneven coverage is complicit in shaping perceptions of economic and cultural 
value. Absent imagery is a signal to viewers that places are not worthy of our virtual or 
physical attention. Pow er et al. (2012)  describe how GSV’s peripheral coverage of a 
marginalized Irish housing estate – which initially made the area visible only from the 
distance of a main road – served to advance negative perceptions of the area in the minds 
of outsiders. Such processes of i ntersubjective stereotyping are central to injustices of 
misrecognition, whereby less powerful groups are subject to ‘distorted identities’ which can 
impact their dignity and sense of self (Zurn, 2003) . 
 
Kya Sands, and many informal settlements in South Africa and  beyond, are similarly only 
visible in GSV from the vantage point of peripheral roads. As a demonstration of the 
potential for producing street view imagery outside of the GSV platform, the Kya Sands Tour 
provides an immersive, 360° visual representation o f the settlement, picking up where GSV 
coverage ends. The tour leads the viewer through the settlement, proceeding first through 
Area A, along the path that crosses Kya Sands stream, through Areas B and C on the west 
side, and then back over the stream on the footbridge and through Area D. Although the 
tour does enable the viewer to visually explore all four sub -areas of the settlement, 
coverage is fragmented; this was due to practical reasons, however the viewer may 
interpret uneven coverage in ways that c ould have negative implications for parts of the 
settlement not covered, similar to the effects of uneven GSV coverage.  
 Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
54 
 The Kya Sands Tour could be made accessible for public viewing on the Roundme platform; 
doing so would demand more consideration about how such imagery could be used as 
virtual form of ‘slum tourism’. Slum tourism is a highly contested activity held up as both an 
example of the exploitation of the urban poor for the entertainment of outsiders, and an 
effective way to draw attention to hid den injustices. If conventional images of informality 
are understood to aestheticize and depoliticize poverty, slum tourism is often legitimized by 
claiming that exposing outsiders to lived realities first hand might avoid this – they are not 
only an aesth etic encounter, but also a moral and epistemological one (Dovey and King, 
2012) . If recognition is formed through intersubjective relations of respect and 
understanding, careful slum tourism provides an opportunity to advance not only 
distribu tive but also justice -as-recognition claims for informal settlements and their 
residents. Frenzel et al. (2014, p.431)  claim that while slum tours in South Africa expose 
economic injustices to outsiders including poli cy makers, they also have symbolic power to 
challenge sociocultural misrecognition, through “addressing invisibility, overcoming 
territorial stigma and [the] empowerment of the urban poor”. But will virtual  slum tours 
have the same effect, without the bene fit of physical presence and a tour guide? 360° 
imagery potentially provides an opportunity for outsiders to experience these spaces in a 
way that may be sympathetic to reality, but at what point does realism descend into 
spectacle, and then to misrecognit ion?  
 
With regards to framing and linear perspective, the viewer is able to manipulate the imagery 
in any direction, approximating the human eye’s position above ground -level and dynamic 
plane of perspective, which enables an effectively seamless upward, d ownward, and 
sideways gaze. Cosgrove (1985, p.48)  explains how realist representation of three -
dimensional space on two -dimensional surfaces “gives the eye absolu te mastery over 
space” through the rules of geometry, which draws the viewer to the artist or photographer 
located outside  of the image. Although the viewer of 360° imagery is empowered to 
continually change the frame and perspective, the photo capture -position seemingly within  
the image amplifies the sense of the photographer or viewer’s ‘mastery over space’, as 
inseparable from it. Gazing downward in the images solidifies this sense of being in the 
image, since the photographer has been edited out and the  viewpoint appears to hover 
above the ground (see Figure 7). Thus it may be said that, akin to the power of aerial 
imagery, 360° imagery may also exhibit a god’s eye view, but much nearer to ground -level. 
From a visual -cognitive perspective, more attention  to how viewers perceive space through 
this seemingly ‘immersive’ imagery is needed. From a social and political perspective, more 
attention is needed to the particular power geometries of immersive imagery, when the 
geometries of linear perspective are no t fixed yet the viewer is still drawn to the 
photographer located ambivalently outside and within the image.

2D4. Distributio n and R ecognition through 360° Street Views  
As illustrated in the Kya Sands – Services and Hazards  street view, 360° imagery could be 
used to fulfil similar objectives as quantitative social audits, to draw attention to uneven 
service provision as an issue of distributive injustice. For many social audits, the typical 
approach has been to ‘let the data speak for themselves’, although as those engaged in this 
form of data activism have discovered, data are a relatively easy target to contest. 
Moreover, data may have little to say about injustice in it s full texture. Quantitative data is 
limited in the way that it represents space as a container comprised of discrete objects 
devoid of context, which is limiting in any setting, but may be particularly incompatible with 
the fluid, dynamic, and ultimately horizontal ontology of informality.  
 
Dovey and King’s (2011; 2012)  work articulates this slippage. As the authors explain with 
reference to Kevin Lynch’s pioneering work on urban imaginaries, instead of discretized 
representations, “[t]he image of the inf ormal city… is often found in the interstices of 
Lynch’s categories of ‘paths’, ‘edges’ and ‘landmarks’” (2011, p.26) , which suggests a need 
for representations that capture informa l settlements as continuous, fully textured places. 
The Kya Sands – Services and Hazards street view  was designed to document the services, 
infrastructure, and environmental hazard issues in the settlement in a way that might more 
effectively represent rea l-world impacts and wider contexts. Through immersive 360° 
imagery, the viewer is exposed to the lived realities of collecting water at communal 
standpipes, open water from leaking standpipes flowing down dirt paths, the dilapidated 
condition of outhouse t oilets, household waste disposed in open spaces, and electricity and 
flooding hazards (e.g., see Figure 8).  
Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
56 
  
Figure 8: Screenshot of the Kya Sands –Services and Hazards street view showing waste 
disposal and open water from leaking standpipe.  
 
Although fur ther evidence is needed, this less reductive and abstract form of datafication 
may prove more convincing and less easy to dismiss by government officials. Social audit 
findings are typically widely circulated to government officials and online upon complet ion 
of the project. The Services and Hazards street view could help to provide the wider context 
and real -world impacts of distributive injustices, especially if combined with the voices of 
residents themselves. Instead of a standalone approach, the street  views may be best suited 
to represent distributive injustices alongside other forms of representation. However, a key 
argument of this piece is that any attempt to advance distributive justice for marginalized 
places must first seek to establish spatial r ecognition  for such places, particularly in settings 
in which being ‘seen by the state’ is a necessary first step towards obtaining basic services 
(Parnell and Pieterse, 2010) . 
 
This argument provides the basis for the Kya Sands Story . As Taylor (1994, p.25, emphasis 
added)  argues, because identities are often shaped by relations of misrecognition, “a person 
or group of people can suffer real damage, real distortion, if the people or society around 
them mirror back to them a confining or dem eaning or contemptible picture of themselves .” 
Drawing on research in a marginalized area of Berlin, Cuny (2018)  identifies three visual -
representational strategies residents employ for managing and contesting such demeaning 
representations of the place they live. First, some resi dents of defamed areas internalize 
stigma, submitting to outsider s’ perceptions but distancing themselves from other residents 
they deem to embody the negative characteristics. Second, residents counter and resist 
negative representations, through producti on of counternarratives. Thirdly, residents can 
try to reverse the stigma, by constructing stigmatizing r epresentations of the majority.  
Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
57 
  
Following the second strategy, the aim of the Kya Sands Story  was to develop 
“counterstigmatizing images” (Cuny, 2018, p.4 )  that reveal a more detailed and nuanced 
picture of the settlement through 360° imagery and further text and multimedia embedded 
as ‘hotspots’ (see Figure 9). The Kya Sands Story  can be compared with anoth er visual 
imagery project designed to tell a hidden story about urban inequalities. The ‘Unequal 
Scenes’ ( https://unequalscenes.com/ ) drone project produces vertical and oblique aerial 
photos and videos documenting gross spatial disparities in South Africa. These ‘dialectical 
images’ (Dovey and King, 2012)  typically depict urban decay and informal settlements 
butting up aw kwardly against wealthy suburbs and golf courses (including Kya 
Sands/Bloubosrand, see Figures 2a and 2b). The photographer  explains the motivation:  
“Inequalities in our social fabric are oftentimes hidden, and hard to see from 
ground -level… I defy the tra ditional power structures that keep these inequalities 
hidden so well from every direction except directly above. If the images provoke 
uncomfortable feelings of fear, despair, or an unsettling realization of complicity 
– good. They are intended to.” (Miller, 2018) . 
 
These images certainly provoke uncomfortable feelings through a novel visual perspective, 
and there is a political potency that could be useful for drawing attention to the country’s 
spatial inequalities. However I argue that their power to make these inequalities visible 
must be weighed against their power to aestheticize and depoliticize poverty, which  can 
reduce the complexities of life in informal settlements to a universalizing story of suffering 
and hardship. In the Kya Sands/Bloubosrand Unequal Scenes aerial video 
(https://unequalscenes .com/kya -sandsbloubosrand ), the opening text – splashed across a 
low-oblique perspective of the settlement – declares, “ The story of Kya Sands is a story of 
ash, smoke, and broken promises” . This text, combined with the specific aerial perspective 
chosen, offers little possibility for viewer agency, and little chance of a nuanced 
understanding of the sett lement.  
 
The story of Kya Sands is partially one of poverty and informality, but it is also a relatively 
well-established residential area with residents t hat come from a variety of backgrounds 
and occupations, which may not align with common perceptions of informal settlements. 
The objective of producing the Kya Sands Story  was to make visible the rather more complex 
and diverse realities of informal settle ment living, which the viewer can experience in a 
selective, non -linear, and interactive way. By self -navigating through the settlement, 
choosing the linear perspective of the 360° imagery, interacting with the additional 
multimedia content and web links p rovided in the hotspots, I argue that the viewer is 
provided greater opportunity to form an opinion of the settlement beyond the suffering 
trope.

between the settlement and the neighbouring suburb of Bloubosrand. The image is 
embedded with two interactive ‘hotspots’ with text, links to further web content, and a video 
depicting the visual inequalities between the residential areas, as captured by the Unequal 
Scenes drone aerial imagery project.  
 
2D5. 360°  Imagery, Exaggerated Seeing, and Misrecognition  
The notion that 360° visual representation can lead to recognition rests on at least two key 
assumptions. The first assumption is that any form of visibility is desirable or  at least 
necessary to draw attention to highly marginalized urban fragments. The second 
assumption is that this specific type of visual imagery could enable a less reductive form of 
datafication that might align better with an ontology of informality, sid estepping the 
limitations of quantitative representation and aerial perspectives. Although the previous 
section considers these ideas with caution, future research should also pay attention to the 
potential for additional harms in which enhanced 360° visib ility leads to advanced injustices 
of misrecognition. Here, feminist philosopher Kelly Oliver’s (2001)  distinction between good 
and bad forms of visibility for marginalized groups is useful. Oliver describes good visibility 
as ‘responsible vision’; bad visibility, however is more complex – it may simply involve 
invisibility, or it may involve various forms of ‘ exaggerated seeing’  including hypervisibility, 
stereotyping, and making a spectacle (p.149). Here I briefly consider one potential 
unintended use of these Kya Sands street views to illustrate how 360° imaging might be 
implicated in one form of exaggerated seeing, hypervisibility.  
 
With little information available about the settlement from government or private sector 
sources, the 360° street views are perhaps the most extensive collection of representational 
artefacts for Kya Sands. But in moving toward vi sibility and (potentially) recognition, there is 
the risk of going too far, of hypervisibility. With the proliferation of digital imaging 
technologies and image hosting platforms, combined with deep learning artificial 
Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
59 
 intelligence (AI), imagery is poised to become the biggest source of quantitative data about 
cities. The status of street views as a potentially less reductive form of datafication 
disregards the possibility of quantification through emerging forms of image analytics and 
computer vision, whic h are ironically referred to as ‘recognition’ techniques. As with aerial 
imagery, automated feature recognition for ground -level imagery is rapidly developing 
within an emerging field labelled ‘urban science’, partly due to the push to produce three -
dimens ional models of urban space for autono mous and smart vehicle markets.  
 
The use of GSV as a tool for virtual auditing of the built environment is well -established 
(Rundle et al., 2011; Iannelli and Dell’Acqua, 2017) , however significant advances in image 
analytics now enable highly detailed, automated extraction and quantification of objects 
and people. Some image recogniti on techniques, such as convolutional neural networks, 
require little if any human training or oversight. These techniques have been used to 
estimate land use and socioeconomic characteristics of urban neighbourhoods in fine grain 
detail (Law et al., 2018; Srivastava et al., 2018) . Gebru et al. (2017)  analyzed 50 million GSV 
images using computer vision recognition techniques, claiming to be able to accurately 
predict local income, ra ce, education, and voting patterns by identifying the make, model, 
and year of all motor vehicles in a neighbourhood. Dodge describes these processes as 
“analogous to the use of overhead imagery and remote sensing, but for urban streetscapes” 
(2018, p.955) . However, I argue that undertaking these processes on 360° street -level 
imagery of formerly invisible spaces could accelerate their hypervisibilit y to a degree not 
possible with aerial imagery, precisely because of the detail captured at the ground -level 
plane of perspective.  
 
Governments and private sector are collaborating on urban analytics problems, with the aim 
of reducing the cost of data coll ection using conventional in -situ approaches. While these 
techniques may provide opportunities to ‘know’ invisible spaces in a rapid and cost effective 
way, this extreme form of datafication and hypervisibility could accelerate the abstract and 
reductive u nderstanding of urban spaces, with harmful consequences for residents. Scholars 
in surveillance studies have drawn attention to the goals of surveillance in the digital era, 
explaining how contemporary forms of surveillance are rarely concerned with monito ring 
and disciplining individual bodies. Rather, contemporary ‘dataveillance’ is about segmenting 
society for capitalist and social control objectives, a process referred to as ‘social sorting’ 
(Lyon, 2003) . Image analytics in urban science is effectively concerned with analogous 
processes of ‘spatial sorting’  – segmenting space into highly refined  categories for capitalist 
exploitation, or to target and profile the people associated with them (Wood, 2017) . 
 
Even though the shift 90 degrees – from vertical, to oblique, to street -level – is 
conceptualized as a shift from quantitative to qualitative forms of datafication, from 
abstraction to human experience, from aestheticization to realism, street -level image 
analytics introduces the possibility of advancing  injustices of m isrecognition as places (and 
the people associated with them) are defined, categorized, and ranked according to 
socioeconomic worth or risk. For example, it has become well known that predictive 
analytics advances processes of social and racial stereotypin g, which leads to misrecognition 
for already marginalized people (Jefferson, 2018) . Taylor (2017)  describes how machine 
learning approaches applied to aerial imagery of migrants could be used to categorize 
behaviours, predict migration patterns, and restrict potential ‘undesirables’ from claiming Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
60 
 asylum. Naik et al.’s (2016)  application of these techniques to GSV imagery demonstrates 
how these forms of analytics, but applied to urban features and based in criminologica l 
theory (e.g. Broken Windows Theory), could be accelerated via the ground -level visual 
perspective, at an “unprecedented resolution and scale” (p.129). In a situation of computer 
vision, “ street -level ceases to be a progressive antidote to the spatial abs tractions of aerial 
imaging , but instead has its own set of power geometries, stemming not from the 
abstraction of vertical perspective but from abstraction by ‘datafication’” (Shapiro, 2017, 3) . 
 
For informal settlements, predictive analytics derived from  highly detailed 360° imagery will 
pose considerable threats to the community’s ability to self -identify, suggesting caution is 
needed when engaging in this form of datafication. For the purposes of this pilot study, 
imagery is likely too low -resolution fo r these forms of image analytics, and it has not yet 
been shared widely beyond the project team. Further research will be required to 
determine whether such imagery advances responsible vision or exaggerated seeing.  
 
 
2E. Conclusions : Visual Data Justice?  
 
2E1. Summary  
Beyond the distribution of ‘goods’ and ‘bads’ in society, further forms of injustice accrue to 
the residents of informal settlements over and above inadequate access to basic services 
and exposure to environmental risks. In foregroun ding the importance of identity formation 
and the status hierarchy, recognition provides a basis for considering injustices that 
threaten the dignity of residents of informal settlements through invisibility, in a country in 
which visibility is considered a basic prerequisite for equality. This paper draws on 
interviews from data activists about the role of quantitative data in advancing distributive 
justice aims, and a pilot study to reflexively consider the potential of immersive, 360° street 
views for ad vancing recognition for informal settlements. Through exploration of key issues 
emerging from the production of three different types of street views for the settlement, 
the paper provides a basis for further enquiry into the role of 360° imagery and other  
immersive visual technologies in shaping how informal spaces are recognized by outsiders. 
Findings from the project provide answers  to the three guiding questions.  
 
The first question was what is the role of quantitative data in representing injustice and  
advancing the needs of marginalized people and places?  Interviews with data activists 
suggested that quantitative data on its own has limited potential as a ‘tool’ of visibility. 
Since informal settlements often “disappear from the cognitive map of those who allocate 
resources” (Dovey and King, 2011, p.22) , social audits in South Africa are pragmatically 
designed to make them visible to policy makers, and in doing so, they often highlight gaps 
between budgeted allocation of services and  the reality on the ground. Yet the data 
themselves have become the target of resistance, providing an opportunity for governments 
to deflect attention away from the substantive issues, rendering the realities of informal 
settlement living further invisibi lized. Because of this, the findings suggest that quantitative 
data, on their own, have limited potential to ‘make visible’ service delivery injustices. This 
finding adds further dimensionality to a growing understanding that conventional forms of 
quantita tive representation (e.g. statistics, maps, static categories) may be unsuited to an Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
61 
 ultimately horizontal, fuzzy, and dynamic ontology of informality. More broadly, it calls into 
question the limitations of any attempt to datafy injustice.  
 
The second que stion was how can consumer -grade 360° imaging technologies be used to 
produce street -level imagery of informal settlements?  The idea for the 360° imagery pilot 
study emerged from three observations:  the limitations of quantitative data as described 
above, wider critiques of aerial approaches to representing informal spaces, and the uneven 
coverage of Google Street View. Against this backdrop, the pilot study sought to advance 
the potential for newly -accessible technologies to be used to produce ground -level  
immersive 360° imagery of informal settlements. The project answered the question by 
demonstrating how street -level imagery of Kya Sands could be produced using consumer -
grade hardware and software and a systematic imagery collection strategy. Three stree t 
views were produced for the settlement, the Kya Sands Tour , Kya Sands – Services and 
Hazards , and the Kya Sands Story .  These findings provide a basis for further research and 
practice into the production of 360° imagery for representing not only informa l settlements, 
but other less visible urban spaces.  
 
The third question was can a potentially more progressive form of datafication be realised 
through street -level 360° imagery?  This pilot study provides preliminary evidence of the 
potential for progress ive datafication through panoramic visual representation, but it also 
raises further questions about the risks of image -based datafication. The Kya Sands Tour 
was designed to broadly resemble the Google Street View aesthetic and mode of user 
interaction, p roviding a ‘virtual tour’ through the four sub -areas of the settlement. Picking 
up where Street View ends, such tours could provide outsiders a deeper understanding of 
informal settlements, and more speculatively, they might help to register such spaces as  not 
separate from but intimately interconnected with the wider city. This tour does however 
raise questions about the potential benefits or  harms of virtual slum tourism.  
 
The Services and Hazards street view was designed to illustrate the realities of li ving in areas 
subject to limited provision of basic services and exposure to hazards, a goal akin to those of 
quantitative social audits, demonstrating distributive injustice. Yet, this street view may be 
less open to resistance and deflection from policy makers compared to the abstractions and 
reductionism of data -driven forms of representation. The Kya Sands Story specifically 
diverges from the GSV aesthetic and mode of user interaction, with the goal of telling a 
more detailed and nuanced story of the se ttlement compared to the reductionist narrative 
propagated by framed aerial and ground -level imagery. The lack of framing and linear 
perspective arguably provides the viewer with a degree of agency and greater chance of a 
nuanced u nderstanding of the settl ement.  
 
These findings thus point to the potential of this imagery for advancing the social justice 
principle of recognition for informal settlements – a possibility that might more broadly be 
referred to as spatial recognition (cf. Luque -Ayala and Neves Maia, 2019) . Yet, as speculated 
in the final section, when highly detailed, panoramic ground -level imagery is used for other 
purposes – including automated urban space classification using computer vision techniques 
– it may have the opposite effect of rapidly accelerating spatial misrecognitio n, which calls 
into question the notion of such imagery as a more realistic, sympathetic, or progressive 
form of datafication.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88

2E2. Recommendations and Future Research Agenda  
This piece is driven by the notion that ground -level 360° geovisualities might o ffer new 
opportunities to advance recognition for marginalized people and places, however potential 
is largely speculative at this stage. As a key topic of future enquiry, research should engage 
potential viewers of such representations (e.g. citizens, off icials, policy makers) to 
understand what the imagery invokes in both residents and outsiders, and what it makes 
possible in terms of visibility and recognition. This aligns with a call by Harris (2015, p.611) ; 
as the author implores, “[t]here is … a need for more engagement with how different 
people actually respond to and experience aerial (and ground -level) views, and how 
different distances from the ground and different planes  of vision (vertical, oblique, or low -
oblique) shape contrasting relationships with cities”. This paper however suggests a further 
dimension of enquiry, focusing on how different people respond to and experience 
immersive 360° views when the frame and fixe d plane of perspective are discarded. A 
follow -on project is in planning, designed around research questions about the added value 
of a street -level imagery approach for advancing visibility and recognition for informal 
settlements, compared with quantitat ive representation strategies. These questions could 
be answered through a full research study involving participatory design and data collection, 
sharing of imagery with the community and municipal government, as well interviews with 
all stakeholders incl uding participants, residents, activist organizations, and public officials.  
 
More generally, findings of the project suggest the following core questions for future 
research and practice on visual representation of informal settlements:  
• How can digital re presentations be produced in a more participatory way, given the 
technical nature of imagery collection and management and the lack of formal 
governance structures in many informal settlements?  
• How might a truly ‘insider’ view diverge from a version diffra cted through a research 
process?  
• What processes are appropriate for engaging wider stakeholders such as ‘virtual 
tourists’ and policy makers?  
• What forms of image ownership and sharing are appropriate, and is it possible to 
prevent harms from unintended use s of imagery?  
 
This paper also suggests at least three topics that must be central to the wider research 
agenda for data justice. First, and perhaps foremost, it points to the limitations of 
conventional forms of quantitative data for representing injustic e. Since a considerable 
portion of the emerging literature on data justice – particularly the ‘data activism’ strains – 
hinge on the idea that (in)justice can be datafied (see discussions in Dourish and Gómez 
Cruz, 2018; Gutierrez and Milan, 2018; Kennedy, 2018) , findings from the interviews suggest 
that more consideration of this basic tenet is neede d. Of course, the beliefs of those 
working in this area are more nuanced, however I suggest that the future agenda for data 
justice must look more carefully to a much longer history of critical enquiry on the societal 
impacts of data (e.g. Westin and Baker, 1972) . The field of smart cities and data -driven 
urbanism provides a current, parallel area of enquiry that could be more closely integrated 
with urban data justice. Amongst other things, work in this area draws attention to a 
disconnect between perceptions of what data are and what data can achieve, and t he 
reality in practice – their ‘imagined affordances’ (Nagy and Neff, 2015; Baack, 2018) . A key Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
63 
 future research question for data justice then is, what forms and examples of injustice can 
be remedied through datafication, a nd which are left invisible by it?  For activism -related 
practices specifically, what is gained and lost when energies are shifted from ‘people power’ 
to ‘data power’?  
 
Second, in drawing a connection between state inattention to distributive injustices and 
community invisibility, this research suggests that recognition must be a core concern of 
data justice, if only as a preliminary step towards addressing inequities in material resources 
and basic services. A future research agenda should seek to address questions such as what 
is the relationship between misrecognition and maldistribution in the context of 
datafication ? Yet recognition is a contested and often vaguely de scribed notion, with 
considerable discord over the meaning even in those who espouse it. How and when 
recognition is achieved (or not) is not objectively and widely agreed upon between 
stakeholders. Because of the ambiguity, a future agenda for recognition  within data justice 
should seek to develop normative frameworks for assessing data -related (mis)recognition. 
Fraser’s notion of ‘participatory parity’ (2008)  provides one such normative ideal that could 
be used to judge when recognition has been achieved. This suggests further research 
questions: what does parity of participation loo k like in a datafying world, and what is the 
relevance of this concept amidst growing resistance to participating in processes of 
datafication ? 
 
Thirdly, in relation to the above two points, this research suggests that more attention as to 
the status of vi sual imagery in relation to datafication must be on the agenda of future work 
in data justice. A key aim of this pilot study was to develop a non -quantitative digital 
representational strategy that might overcome limitations of surveys, maps, and other 
reductive forms of representation. While the findings and discussion suggest meaningful 
possibilities for representing informality in a way that is sympathetic to informal spaces and 
their residents, the status of imagery as a somehow more realist and less re ductive form of 
datafication might be highly naïve. This project specifically grappled with a growing sense of 
unease about the imagery, in part because a limited degree of participation risked our 
speaking on behalf of the community, but more so because o f the potential for unintended 
uses of the imagery once released for wider access.  
 
The first concern could be addressed with a future project based on a fully participatory 
design, however addressing the second concern will require considerably more atten tion. 
There is growing evidence of individual - and group -level injustices derived from big data 
surveillance (Dencik et al., 2016) , from commer cial analysis of digital behavioural data 
gleaned from use of the web, mobile phones, and smart technologies (Zuboff, 2015; Taylor 
et al., 2017) , and through processes of ‘function creep’ whereby data collected for one 
reason is then analyzed for another unjust purpose (Cinnamon et al., 2016; Heeks and 
Renken, 2018) . A small amount of attention has been paid to data injustice in the context of 
aerial imagery analytics (e.g. Taylor, 2017)  however a future agenda for data justice must 
give more credenc e to the notion of images -as-data, and specifically, the new forms of 
analytics they make possible. This will soon become a more ‘visible’ problem, as AI and 
computer vision techniques are increasingly applied to photos of people and places in rich, 
ground -level detail, rendering ‘born quantitative’ data merely a drop in the urban data 
bucket.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88

 Case 3: Spatial|Data Justice  
Mapping and Digitised Strolling against 
Moral Police in Iran

Abstract  
 
Through a case study of women’s resistance against the moral police in Iran, this paper 
contends that claims to data justice cannot be investigated unless they are situated in 
broader political frames. Whilst the current literature uses a single axis analysis of data 
justice as well as conceptual tools that are appropriated for democratic power relations, this 
research positions data justice in a matrix of injustices in an un equal  and undemocratic 
political apparatus.  
 
The paper scrutinises the intersection of data and sp atial injustice in Iran by analysing the 
way traffic camera footage is used against female drivers with improper veiling. Considering 
compulsory hijab and policing of it as a spatial injustice that limits and disturbs women’s 
access to public places, the c ase study examines ways of resistance that address 
spatial|data injustice: firstly, a mobile phone application called Gershad that uses collective 
mapping to pin moral police patrols on maps by users; secondly, a social media campaign 
called White Wednesda ys that encourages women to film and share their public strolls 
without hijab, their confrontations with religious pro -regime people, and videos of singing, 
dancing and cycling in public spaces.  
 
Using Fraser’s theory of “abnormal justice”, this research d raws attention to particularities 
of each case of data justice; taking into account the intersections of socio -political axes of 
injustice in different layers of local, regional and global analysis. The paper offers a 
“situated” analytical framework by bri nging in space as an inquisitive component and moves 
from a sole discussion of data justice to a more intersectional study of spatial and data 
justice combined. Participation in “small data” projects is introduced as one resistance 
strategy against injusti ces of big data systems, fulfilling the principle of “parity of 
participation” to achieve justice, especially in undemocratic political contexts.

 3A. Introduction  
 
This paper is written as part of a collection of case studies on urban data, inequality and 
justice in the global South. On its journey to apply a lens of data justice to urban data, this 
case study has taken a step back to engage itself critically with a broader question, ‘can any 
claim to data justice be studied without addressing its intersection with other forms of 
injustice?’ In doing so, this case study has immediately exposed itself to immense political 
questions and therefore conceptualises a framew ork for data justice (section 3B.1) based on 
Fraser’s theory of abnormal justice (Fraser 2008) . According to this theory, the first criteria 
for achieving justice, namely distribution, recognition, and representation cannot be 
discussed when a group of people are deprived from participation in “authorized contests 
over  justice” (Fraser 2008, 408) . Hence, this research puts the question of data justice firstly, 
inside a political agenda and secondly, in intersection with other forms of injustice.  
 
As a case study of such formulation of data justice this paper analyses the way traffic 
camera footage is used in Ir an to criminalise women who drive without proper hijab. This 
paper posits compulsory hijab as a form of spatial injustice (Soja 2010)  as it affects wo men’s 
freedom of movement, their feeling of security and meaningful participation in social life. 
Spatial|Data Justice is then introduced as a way to examine the intersection of these two 
forms of justice (section 3B.2) providing a short introduction to th e history, challenges and 
contestations over the issue of hijab in Iran. The essay then proceeds to a more detailed 
discussion of surveillance of women and its interrelations to issues of spatial|data justice 
(section 3B.3) and aims to contribute to the sh ortcoming of surveillance studies’ literature 
by addressing surveillance of women as a large group of population. Section 3B.4 introduces 
two case studies of resistance against spatial|data justice: firstly, a mobile phone 
application called Gershad that u ses collective mapping to pin moral police patrols on maps 
by users; secondly, a social media campaign called White Wednesdays that encourages 
women to film and share their public strolls without hijab, their confrontations with 
religious pro -regime people , and videos of singing, dancing and cycling in public spaces.  
 
Using thematic analysis methods (section 3C), some of the recurring themes in Gershad’s 
twitter account and also videos posted on the White Wednesdays’ campaign’s Instagram 
account are explore d. The findings of this analysis (section  3D) demonstrate strong 
connections between hijab activism, spatial justice and wider political agendas. Here, these 
two small data projects are portrayed as a possible way to tackle the injustices in larger data 
sets. Finally, the paper recommends integration of other forms of injustice as an axis of 
analysis in studying data justice (section 3E). Taking a political and critical approach to data 
justice, this case study aims to draw attention to the inadequacy of an y discussion on data 
justice without its situatedness in a broader political framework, and recommends a 
scrutiny of data justice in an intersectional matrix of injustices with different layers of local, 
regional and global analysis.

 3B. Background  
 
3B1. Data Justice  
With the unbelievable speed of developments in the field of data technologies and their 
significant impact on the transformation of our lives, debating data justice is timely if not 
late. Several studies have focused on ways that could make data ethically just, such as 
making machine learning fairer by mitigating discrimination without collecting sensitive data 
(Veale and Binns 2017) , preventing biases in educational data mining (Ben S hahar 2017)  or, 
excavating representations of minorities and outliers in big data (Welles 2014) . Although a 
significant effort, other academic enquiries take a more holistic approach and situate data in 
already -existing discourses of justice. Heeks and Renken (20 18) divide approaches to data 
justice into three categories of ‘instrumental data justice’ to ensure fair use of data, 
‘procedural data justice’ to ensure fair handling of data, and ‘distributive rights -based 
justice’ to ensure rights of privacy, access, o wnership and representation. Although these 
approaches clarify incidents of injustice in data systems, they do “not encompass the social 
structures which at least partly determine data uses, processes, distributions, and rights” 
(Heeks and Renken 2018, 96) . 
 
The authors then define structural data justice as “the degree to which society contains and 
supports the data -related institutions,  relations and knowledge systems necessary for 
realisation of the values comprised in a good life” (Heeks and Renken 2018, 96) . Albei t they 
immediately recognise the importance of defining what a good life means, the discussion 
around it stops at the recognition of the problem. Similarly, existing data justice discourses 
emphasise more on the individual level of justice. For example, an  ecosystemic approach 
based on Sen’s capabilities theory defines data justice based on three pillars of visibility, 
digital (dis)engagement and countering data -driven discrimination (Taylor 2017)  and hence 
provides universal answers to a particular ques tion. Taylor develops her model by asking, 
“What are good governance principles for the use of big data in a democratic context, and 
who should be responsible for determining them?” (Taylor 2017, 10) ; a question that brings 
about a completely different set of answers if asked in an undemocratic context. This paper 
then aims to elaborate on the political aspects of data justice by situating itself in the 
context of critical data studies (Dalton and Thatcher 2015)  and by shedding “light on 
political struggles and social processes that precede artefacts… [r]evealing the political and 
social interests embedded in technology” (Silva 2007, 175) . 
 
In such critical approaches to data justice, surveillance is understood as an “active social 
process” (Jiwani 2015)  that upholds social structures. Such disciplinary roles could also be 
assigned to data systems. Johnson argues that databases have a normalising function and 
theorises “data systems as discipli nary surveillance” (Johnson 2014, 268) . He shows for 
example how educational databases of students’ performance are used to cut 
underperforming programs and affect educational choices of students or the financial funds 
available to th em. Although his observations are made in a democratic context to achieve 
‘information justice’ through open data (Johnson 2014) , his observations can be well used in 
undemocratic environments. Other researchers have highlighted the relation between data -
driven governance and broader social justice agendas (Dencik, Hintz, and Cable 2016, 1)  but 
their work covers mainly activists resisting governm ent surveillance at user level and does Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
72 
 not include surveillance on large groups of people. Regardless, the aforementioned research 
recognises the urgency to “examine the ideological basis of data -driven processes, situating 
this form of governance within a political agenda  […] scrutinis[ing] the interests  and power 
relations  at play in ‘datafied’ societies that enfranchise some and disenfranchise others” 
(Dencik, Hintz, and Cable 2016, 9) . 
 
In order to include the above -mentioned political aspect in conceptualising data justice, this 
study uses the concept of ‘abnormal justice’ (Fraser 2008) . The theory of abnormal justice  
argues that the ‘what’, the ‘who’, and the ‘how’ of justice remain disputed in our tim e. 
Consequently, there is no shared understanding of “what justice claimants can look like 
(individuals or groups, fellow citizens or all human beings), the substantive focus of justice 
claims (economic redistribution only, or other ontologically different  forms of redress), 
which social divides possess injustice (e.g., nationality, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality), 
and the agencies and scales of arbitration and redress (state or non -state actors, territorial 
or supraterritorial bodies)” (Cinnamon 2017, 612 -3). In order to achieve justice under such 
circumstances, Fraser defines “the normative principle of parity of participation. According 
to this principle, justice requires social arrangements that permit all to participate as peers 
in social life” (Fraser 2008, 405) . She t hen identifies three main obstacles of justice in an 
“ordinary -political” way ( Fraser 2008, 407 ), as distribution, recognition, and representation. 
These obstacles were also addressed in one way or the othe r in the studies on data justice 
mentioned above. The  outstanding difference is, however, Fraser’s reflection on the milieus 
that make justice realisable, acknowledging the fact that, “in order to apply the principle of 
participatory parity to first -order questions of distribution, recognition, and representation, 
one must be able to jump to the next level, where the frame itself is in dispute” (Fraser 
2008, 407) . Fraser introduces then a new level of “metapolitical injustice” comprehending 
“injustices of misframing. Such injustices occur when a p olity’s boundaries are drawn in such 
a way as to wrongly deny some people the chance to participate at all in its authorized 
contests over justice” (Fraser 2008, 408) . 
 
3B2. Spatial|Data Justice  
In addition to integration of political dimensions to any discussion of justice, this paper 
argues tha t data justice cannot be fully comprehended unless in an intersection with other 
forms of injustice. Data justice has been discussed in conjunction with other social agendas, 
such as development (Heeks and Renken 2018) , economic justice (Newman 2015) , legality 
of surveillance (Cinnamon 2017) , etc. In a more metapolitical level, following Fraser’s 
formulation of justice, this case study takes an intersectional approach (Cho, Crenshaw, and 
McCall 2013)  to data justice in conjunction with spatial justice. This claim is based on 
understanding two basic principles: that “the political organization of space is a particularly 
powerful source of spatial injustice” (Soja 2009, 3) , and that “a focus on data justice is […] 
not only on the justness of data practices [but also on] the biases and inequalities baked 
directly into data” (Cinnamon 2017, 622) . It is needless to say, th at the same set of data 
could have been studied through the lens of, for example, class discrimination against poor 
cyclists that act as messengers and food deliveries in metropolitan Tehran and their income 
is extremely dependent on breaking traffic rules . In the current case study, the spatial 
aspect is only one axis of the matrix of injustices that shape the debated data injustice.  
 Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
73 
 In his book Seeking Spatial Justice , Edward Soja (2010) offers a detailed chronological study 
of the concept of spatial jus tice in works of different geographers, but majorly focuses on 
the ‘right to the city’ in works of French philosopher Henri Lefebvre (Lefebvre 1968)  and 
Marxist geographer Davi d Harvey (Harvey 2003) . Lefebvre’s transformative formulation of 
space as reflective ‘and’ constructive of social relations, changed the way ‘space’ was 
understood, and scrutinised the social organisation of space in capitalist times (Lefebvre 
1991) . The formerly mentioned authors all emphasise th e “socio -spatial dialectic [meaning 
that] the spatial shapes the social as much as the social shapes the spatial” (Soja 2009, 2). In 
order to shed some light on the concept of ‘spatial justice' in a more concrete and action -
oriented approach, this paper fo llows the propositions of the Journal of Spatial Justice , a 
pioneer in publishing in the field:  
“I. There are two cardinal forms of spatial injustice:  
A. The involuntary confinement of any group to a limited space – segregation, 
ghettoization – the unfreed om argument.  
B. The allocation of resources unequally over space – the unfair resources argument.  
II. Spatial injustice is derivative of broader social injustice – the derivative argument.  
III. Social injustices always have a spatial aspect, and social injustices cannot be addressed 
without also addressing their spatial aspect – the spatial remedies argument.  
IV. Spatial remedies are necessary but not sufficient to remedy spatial injustices – let alone 
social injustice – the partial remedy argumen t. 
V. The role of spatial injustice relative to social injustice is dependent on changing social, 
political, and economic conditions, and today there are trends that tend both to decrease 
and to increase the importance of the spatial – the historical embed dedness argument” 
(Marcuse 2009, 3) . 
 
According to the above -mentioned formulation of 
spatial justice, this paper frames compulsory hijab 
as an issue of spatial injustice, which deprives 
women, fully or partially, from accessing public 
spaces (Justice for Iran 2014) , limits their freedom 
of movement, affects their feeling of security and 
well-being in public (Gould 2014)  and gravely 
restricts their participation in differe nt aspects of 
social life. On 22 June 1980, just a year after the 
victory of Iranian revolution, women were banned 
from entering governmental and public service 
buildings without hijab (covering of their hair and 
body) (Shojaie 2014) . Women’s demonstrations 
against compulsory hijab did not receive any 
support from their former comrades (Sedghi 2007)  
and their voices got lost in the revolutionary haze 
of the days. With the invasion of Iraq in September 
1980 and beginning of an 8 -year gruelling war, the 
issue of hijab seemed even more irrelevant. Finally 
in 1983 and with the ratification of the  Islamic 
Punitive Law in the Iranian Parliament, not having 
proper hijab in all public places was considered an

 offence punishable with 74 lashes (Justice for Iran 2014, 12) . The punishment was later 
changed in 1997 to 10 -60 days of imprisonment or a fine (ibid, 14).  
 
From the violent suppression of women’s largest rally against compulsory hijab on 8 March 
1979 to the legal and social establishment of controlling women’s clothing in the years 
afterwards, street patrols of “revolutionary committees” played an important role in 
harassing women who were deemed not properly covered (Kar 2017) . By the ratification of 
the new Islamic Punitive Law and disbanding of committees in 1993 (Justice for Iran 2014, 
13), police forces were then legally required to arrest women who di sobeyed the 
compulsory hijab law. This commenced police surveillance of women in all public spaces of 
Iran until today. In addition to patrolling public spaces such as parks, streets and public 
transportation, every university, hospital, government office,  public service bureau, 
shopping mall and similar is staffed to control women’s clothing (see Figure 1). In 2005, 
special police forces called “Guidance Patrol” [Gasht -e-Ershad] were installed to observe 
compliance with compulsory hijab code (Erdbrink 2014) . The Guidance Patrols aim mainly to 
bar improperly veiled women from entering public spaces and increase the risk of defiance. 
For example, in Tehran9, arrested women are transferre d to the Bureau against Social 
Corruption, part of the Police Forces for Social Security. There, their photos are taken and 
their personal information is archived. Arrested women should fill up forms about their 
psychological well -being and then wait for f amily members to bring them proper clothes. 
Before leaving the police station, they have to destroy their ‘bad’ clothes with scissors. If a 
woman resists at any stage of the process or repeats the ‘crime’ frequently, a legal case will 
be made and she would  be sent to the courts of law.  
 
3B3. Compulsory Hijab and Surveillance of Women  
Taking the political aspect of spatial|data justice into account unfolds another important 
interrelation. After the controversial presidential elections in 2009 and the subsequ ent 
uprising, CCTV cameras became compulsory in cafes, universities and even kindergartens. 
Traffic control cameras mushroomed in big cities and although it was publicly announced 
that police and security forces could only have access to footage of these c ameras upon 
judicial request, it was revealed in 2015 that the entire country’s urban CCTV cameras 
transmit their footage to the headquarters of Special Police Forces, who are mandated to 
deal with insurgency (Voice of America Persian Service 2015) . Using data gathered through 
traffic cameras for other purposes soon proved useful in controlling women’s hijab.  
 
In continuation with strict control of wo men’s clothing in public spaces, as of June 2017, 
women who do not properly cover their hair while driving are legally prosecuted and their 
cars are impounded (Mizan News Agency 2017) . In December 2017 twitter users reported 
that ‘improper hijab’ was being ca ptured on traffic cameras (see Figure 2). Just a day after 
the reports, the head of traffic police denied the rumours (Tasnim News 2017) . Amid such 
denials, improper hijab fines and impounding of cars is so customary that legal consultation 
websites publish step by step guides for women who receive text messages with a code 
14/15 as a warning for improper hijab in a vehicle (Bidbarg Legal Consultancy 2018) . It is not 
clear if the ‘crime’ is spotted by a guidance patrol or a CCTV/traffic camera. As mentioned 
 
9 There are many documented  accounts of women who have been arrested by the Guidance Patrols, see for 
example, (Pardis 2011)  (M 2015)  (Bidarzani website 2015) . Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
75 
 before, the government actively 
uses the footage of traffic cameras 
in tackling political dissent. It  is 
therefore not unexpected that 
similar methods would be used 
against women. By doing so, the 
traffic data is not solely gathered to 
facilitate road safety and traffic 
control but also it gathers, classifies 
and uses data for other purposes, 
such as surv eillance, sorting, 
disciplining and punishing women.  
 
Surveillance of specific groups inside 
a bigger population has been long a 
subject of study in the field of 
surveillance studies. Surveillance 
has even been considered “as a 
means of social sorting” (Lyon 2003, 
8). This sorting function has been 
studied in a variety of areas such as 
database marketing targeting 
specific categories of consumers 
(Gandy 1993) , colonialism (Sa’di 
2012) , race (Browne 2015) , using 
heteronormative paradigms for 
justification of the ‘war on terror’ 
(Puar 2007) , etc. However, this 
paper focuses on sorting practices that not only reflect the already existing discriminatory 
power relations but also consolidate them through surveillance. The overlapping of two 
fields of gender studies and surveillance studies had not received much attention until 
recently. In 2009, some of the main researchers in the field of surveillance studies stated 
firmly that, “surveillance studies needs gender and sexuality” (Ball et al. 2009) . Such need 
has resulted in more thorough examination of surveillance apparatuses through the lens of 
gender and race (Van der Meulen and Heynen 2016)  (Dubrofsky and Magnet 2015)  but the 
research remains overwhelmingly in the global North.  
 
The current literature on the subject could be roughly divided to three categories:  
a) Surveillance that specifically targets women, for example voyeuristically through CCTV 
cameras in public urban spaces (Koskela 2002) , monitoring the appeal of cocktail 
waitresses in casinos (Bayard de Volo 2003) , controlling strippers not to get any 
unreported tips (Egan 2004 ), limiting women’s activity in outdoor recreational parks 
(Wesely and Gaardner 2004) , etc.  
b) Surveillance that is built on other unequal power relations, for example surveillance of 
African American young women and their fear of sexual harassment by police officers 
(Brunson and Miller 2006) , violence against women and the contradictory role of 
surveillance in prevention of violence and control by case workers (Campbell 2000)  
Figure 2. The Tweet reads, “This is not a milk or bread queue. 
All these people are at Moral Security Police station because 
the driver of their car has had improper hijab. Recently  
improper hi jab is being captured on CCTV cameras on the 
roads” (Azarpey 2017) . Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
76 
 (Gordon 2000)  (Mason and Magnet 2012)  or how shelters for victims of domestic 
violence tailor their services in a way that excludes some racial categories or 
undocumented immigrants (Smith 2015) , surveillance of non -gender -normative bodies 
(Conrad 2009)  (Beauchamp 2009)  or exclusion of transgender people from state -issued 
birth certificates (Moore and Currah 2015) . 
c) Surveillance as a gendered practice, for example how surveillance systems “operate on 
ideals of masculine control at a distance and as a result enforce a masculinization of 
space and practice” (Monahan 2009, 299) , or how surveillance expands the male gaze 
(Van der Meulen and Heynen 2016) . 
 
In continuation to the above -mentioned studies, this paper  examines not only the 
surveillance of female drivers by a strictly controlling and oppressive male gaze, but also 
investigates the “masculinisation of space” (Koskela 2002)  through surveillance. The afore -
mentioned concept was co ined to explain that the installation of CCTV cameras, not only 
does not prevent harassment of women, but also contributes to masculinisation of space, 
since most of the camera room operators are men. Taking this concept to a context that 
women’s public pr esence is severely controlled through law, police forces and, surveillance, 
gives it new meanings and effects.  
 
Consequently, here, surveillance is understood as an infraction of “social justice”, that sorts 
“people into categories, assigning worth or risk , in ways that have real effects on their life -
chances (Lyon 2003, 1) . Therefore, this paper studies compulsory hijab not o nly as 
surveillance of women but also as a way of producing public space that is not tolerant 
towards specific female bodies. It must be noted here that compulsory hijab is only one of a 
number of legal freedoms that Iranian women lost after the revolution . The Iranian 
progressive family law was one of the first laws that were abolished after the 1979 
revolution, leaving married women with no rights to education, work, and travel. Other 
patriarchal laws prohibited women to work in occupations that were deem ed masculine 
such as being a judge, pilot, president, etc. As clearly reflected in the definition of spatial 
justice, ‘justice’ in such situations cannot be achieved with just spatial remedies. Social 
justice and consequently spatial justice require a stro ng political will for change.  
 
3B4. Against Spatial|Data Injustice  
As mentioned earlier in this paper, resistance against compulsory hijab dates back to the 
first months after the 1979 revolution in Iran. Although the resistance initially had a legal, 
political and rights -based approach, after the violent suppression of demonstrations and 
arresting, torture and execution of political activists, resistance against compulsory hijab 
was transformed to ongoing everyday acts of resistance, which focused on inten tional 
improper veiling, e.g. putting on makeup, leaving hair out, wearing short or tight clothing, 
etc. These everyday strategies have been the subject of numerous studies and popular 
journalism (for academic examples see (Sedghi 2007) , (Bayat 2010)  and (Sadeghi 2010) ). 
Following a global trend, urban governance in Iran is on the path to digitalisation and many 
government services are now delivered through electronic syste ms. These governmental 
systems work based on large databases that gather, classify, summon and archive data. The 
data gathered through traffic cameras reflects the already existing spatial injustice against 
women and as a result, in addition to the old res istance strategies, there are new trends of 
resistance that take a data approach.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88

Small data has been contemplated as a 
tool of justice that would go beyond the 
usage of data by others and would 
concentrate on how individuals, groups 
or communities use da ta for themselves 
“in order to live the life they value” 
(Heeks and Renken 2018, 95) . In a 
structural view, small data is theorised 
through data intermediary organisations, 
“as channels through which citizens can 
influence the balance of 
representation/privacy and the nature of 
data ownership and access … important 
determinants of the constitution and 
distributive benefits of information value 
chains” (Heeks and Shekhar 2019, 1008) . 
In a more n etworked view and with a 
political understanding of data systems, 
small data initiatives by groups of 
people, who are themselves affected by 
data injustices are rather considered as 
active resistance. This case study 
examines two different small data 
proje cts that aim to tackle the issue of 
Spatial|Data injustice.  
 
Although surveillance of such a large 
group of people seems practically impossible, in 2013 three million women received 
“injunctions” through police patrols in Tehran for their improper hijab (Gershad n/a)  . In 
2017, 207,000 women undertook written promises to correct their behaviour, while 18,000 
women were sent to court (ibid.). In r esponse, an anonymous group of activists created 
“Gershad10”, a collective mapping application that allowed users to pin moral police patrols 
on the map (see Figure 3). The application soon attracted younger tech savvy women and 
men that helped each other avoid prosecution and aggressive police behaviour.  
 
Another recent development is the White Wednesdays’ campaign that encourages women 
to walk in public spaces without headscarves, film the walk and possible confrontations, and 
post it on social media ( https://www.instagram.com/masih.alinejad ). The videos have 
caused heated national debates and the number of anonymous participants is growing by 
the day. The White Wednesdays’ campaign stands not only a s a claim to physical space but 
also occupies digital space by publishing its own narrative of how space should be organised 
justly. The videos also act as returning the gaze of surveillance and its normalising effect on 
women that have been systemically c ontrolled, surveilled and criminalised. In doing so, 
although they do not gather data as systematically as a mapping application such as 
 
10 Literally means going around moral police patrols

 Gershad, they protest the unjust collection of women’s data by using the same tool as the 
authorities: their cameras. T hough the identification of police officials or documentation of 
the aggressive behaviour of pro -regime passers -by is not collected in a data system per se, 
the White Wednesdays’ campaign succeeds in highlighting the disciplinary power of 
surveillance and the intersection of spatial and data justices.  
 
3C. Methods  
 
In order to shed light on the concepts introduced in this paper, and the interrelation 
between them, the case study uses thematic analysis of Gershad’s twitter account, and 
videos posted on the W hite Wednesdays’ campaign’s Instagram account. The tweets from 
Gershad’s twitter account, in the year preceding 25 May 2019, were downloaded and after 
cleaning, coded and categorised based on their content. Also, the last 300 videos of White 
Wednesdays’ In stagram, preceding 25 May 2019, were coded and categorised.  
 
Braun and Clarke (2006, 79)  define thematic analysis as “a method for identifying, analysing 
and reporting patterns (themes) within data”. In  this research, hijab activism and different 
modes of resistance against policing of women’s clothing, have been considered as key 
themes. Other themes were understood in relation to the key themes. Thus, the thematic 
analysis has been conducted in a ‘theo retical’ manner, meaning that the themes identified 
“tend to be driven by the researcher’s theoretical or analytic interest” (Braun and Clarke 
2006, 84) . 
 
Therefore, driven by the theoretical framework  of abnormal justice, general political 
commentary at the level of “metapolitical injustice” (Fraser 2008, 408)  has been coded as a 
theme. Following the paper’s understanding of intersectional justice, other instances of 
injustice, such as activism on labour rights, teachers’ unions, violence aga inst women, 
religious minorities, etc. have been coded as relevant themes. The other thematic codes 
mainly cover the objectives and functions of the application or the social media campaign. 
Additionally, this paper has analysed the social media posts on a  semantic level and has not 
taken a discourse -analysis approach, as the limited scope of this case study does not allow a 
more detailed study of the reasons behind the formation of the specific messages posted on 
social media. All the themes and subsequent  categories will be discussed in detail in the 
following section.

 3D. Findings  
 
This paper has introduced the concept of spatial|data justice in order to put emphasis on 
the intersection of data justice with other forms of justice, when justice is envisaged in a 
broader political framework. Such intersections, overlaps, associations and references 
between spatial justice – here the case of compulsory hijab – data justice and t he general 
political situation can be clearly demonstrated through the thematic analysis of two main 
resistance trends against compulsory hijab. A thematic analysis of Gershad’s tweets (see 
Figure 4) shows a major involvement with the application’s main pu rpose as a collective 
mapping tool with 56% of the posts dedicated to sharing the location of guidance patrols in 
Tehran. Together with location maps in other towns (8%) and, guidelines, technical 
information and update alarms (11%), 75% of the twitter act ivities address the pursuit of 
the application itself. Eight percent of the tweets tackle the issue of compulsory hijab by 
debating news, interviews, official statements, and public policies. The rest of the tweets 
(16%) contribute to the more general poli tical discussions in Iran, specifically those that 
question the undemocratic nature of ideological imposition on people, such as police 
violence against people who publicly eat or drink during the month of Ramadan.  
 
Such overlap between resistance to diffe rent forms of policing is also clear in the 
application’s recommendation of anti -proxy technologies. Since the application was filtered 
by the Iranian authorities, the app developers regularly shared free anti -proxy applications 
for their users, but as off  April 2019 the anti -proxy settings are integrated into the 
application configurations. Although such technologies would enable users to benefit from 
the application, they also pave the way for users to circumvent the strict policing and 
control of the cyb er space11. Gershad, as a small data project, not only challenges the spatial 
injustice against women but also provokes resistance against other forms of injustice by 
confronting the strict control and policing that affect the daily life of Iranians. In do ing so, 
the application goes beyond a mapping experience and targets the political foundations that 
are used to justify policing.

 Such a political engagement is 
even more observable in the 
videos posted on the Instagram 
account of the founder of White 
Wednesdays’ campaign. As 
portrayed in Figure 5, the most 
frequent theme in these videos is 
the commentary on general 
politics and a harsh critique of 
the socio -economic 
circumstances of Iranians. The 
campaign also takes a solid 
stance in advocating women’s 
right to public spaces by 
frequently posting videos of 
women dancing, singing or 
cycling in public spaces – which 
are all forbidden. Although hijab 
is being frequently discussed as 
women’s right to choose their 
clothing, the links to spatial 
injustice are evident. Here, the 
right to the city entails more 
substantial political elements, 
which problematises the 
dominant discourses on female 
bodies, women’ s role in the family and society and their public engagements. Consequently, 
issues of prohibiting women to enter football stadiums or to compete in international sports 
events addresses simultaneously other forms of discrimination in conjunction with spat ial 
justice. Harassment in public spaces and acid attacks also emerge as themes that highlight 
not only women’s lack of access to public spaces but also the violence they experience 
trespassing the established boundaries. Among the videos of women’s confro ntation with 
people opposing their hijab -free strolling, most videos depict confrontations with religious 
people. The videos demonstrate a larger ongoing debate at the public level about the 
religious justifications of ideological organisation of space. Mo st of the videos in this 
category are hashtagged with “my_camera_my_weapon,” accentuating the act of resistance 
by reciprocating the violence with returning the gaze.

 The interconnections 
between the identified 
themes could be better 
illustrated by clustering 
the similar themes into 
larger categories (see 
Figure 6). Although 
hijab -related activism –
including videos of 
women strolling without 
hijab, their 
conf rontation with 
police, and religious or 
pro-regime people, and 
news and updates about 
arrested activists – 
constitutes the larger 
body of Instagram posts, 
the specific coverage of other resistance movements – including workers’ unions, teacher 
unions, reli gious minorities, etc – comprise a considerable percentage of all the Instagram 
posts. The interrelation between activism against compulsory hijab, political resistance and 
spatial justice are clearly demonstrated in the way this small data project links t hese 
concepts together. The immediate reference to larger political frameworks could also be 
observed in the way the campaign represents itself at an international level to not only draw 
support for its activities, but also to put more pressure on the Iran ian government to change 
its practices of systematic discrimination against women.  
 
3E. Discussion and Conclusions  
 
This paper has theorised data justice by using the theory of ‘abnormal justice’ (Fraser 2008) 
with the recognition that justice cannot be fo rmulated when specific groups of people have 
no chance/right to participate in “authorized contests over justice” (Fraser 2008, 408). By 
applying the principle of ‘parity of participation’ (Fraser 2008, 407) in order to recognise a 
situation as potentially  bearing the possibility of justice, the Fraserian conceptualisation 
instantaneously exposes its political nature. Therefore, I have argued that data justice, as an 
instance of justice, cannot be scrutinized without considering the political framework that  
encompasses it. Such understanding of justice challenges the current literature on data 
justice that mainly focuses on democratic power relations. As this paper series pinpoints the 
issue of data justice in the global South, it proves necessary to situate  questions of data 
justice also in less - and un -democratic settings. Furthermore, a political understanding of 
data justice cannot be complete, if it is not situated in intersection with other instances of 
injustice. In this case study, the overlap between  spatial and data justice is explored but 
other research can incorporate other axes of analysis.  
 
After developing a theoretical framework for spatial|data justice, the paper has specifically 
examined the aforementioned concept in regards to a case study i n Iran. The extreme 
implementation of compulsory hijab regulations against women is defined as a case of

 spatial justice, since it regulates, bars and controls women’s access to public spaces. Hence, 
the usage of traffic camera footage to punish female dri vers with improper veiling is treated 
as a mishandling of data – a data injustice – but also only meaningful in conjunction with 
another form of injustice: spatial injustice. This critical intersectional approach to data 
justice is fully reflected in two e xamples of resistance against spatial|data injustice. The first 
example, Gershad, is an application that uses collective mapping to locate moral police 
patrols and the second example is a campaign that encourages women to reclaim the public 
space by stroll ing without hijab and recording possible reactions and confrontations. A 
thematic analysis of the social media posts by both projects demonstrate not only a strong 
interconnection with other forms of activism but also a manifest stance against 
undemocratic  political systems. Such references to political issues reveal an underlying 
interrelatedness of discourses of justice, including those on data justice.  
 
Drawing from the case study of Iran, this paper develops an intersectional political approach 
to data justice that situates the issue in a matrix of injustice within a broad political 
framework. Although such a matrix of injustice might seem less chaotic in a democratic 
political framework, especially in countries of the global North, a closer look wo uld reveal 
hidden intersections. Furthermore, as data justice cannot be limited to a specific platform’s 
data polices, it also cannot be contained in a country’s approach to data and privacy rights. 
This paper argues that an intersectional political approa ch to data justice, as an analytical 
tool, could be employed in variety of contexts. In the next section, some possible research 
projects are discussed that would apply analytical tools conceptualised based on this case 
study. Additionally, although here a  small data vs. big data approach has been introduced as 
a possible resistance strategy against data injustice, each case of data injustice would 
necessitate a different analysis of resistance alternatives based on its situatedness in the 
matrix of injusti ces within a political framework.  
 
3E1. Recommendations for Future Research  
 
Spatial|data justice as a concept with an intersectional approach to data justice could 
contribute to any research in this area that has a spatial component. For example, research  
on informal settlements that analyse the right to the city for marginalised groups of citizens 
in conjunction with data -related issues could apply spatial|data justice as an analytical tool. 
Such research could include surveillance of crime in slums, info rmal settlements’ mapping 
failures, collective mapping of neighbourhoods and many other research areas that 
specifically investigate ‘space’.  
 
A political intersectional approach to data justice could also include other forms of injustice. 
This paper has t aken space as an axis of analysis but other notions are immediately 
imaginable. Even in this paper’s exact case, ‘class’ could be considered as an analytical 
dimension, when it comes to motorcycle messengers in Tehran, that earn their living by 
minimising the time of a journey between two points in a city stretching to 1748 km2 
through constantly breaking traffic laws. These messengers fall prey to the extensive 
network of CCTV cameras while economic circumstances and the low quality of state 
delivery servi ces gravely affects their observance of traffic rules. Other broader examples 
could be drawn in different levels of analysis. There is for example a massive amount of 
research on the treatment of undesirable bodies (homosexual, queer, transgender, Muslim, Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
83 
 veiled, poor, etc.) in European immigration systems12. The biometric and immigration data 
that is being collected on such bodies cannot be considered in a sheer discourse of data 
justice, since in order for a body to be the subject of such gathering of dat a, one must first 
belong to an undesirable category. European passport holders that enter the UK for 
example, do not even pass through such strict regimes of control. Here, doing justice to data 
justice necessitates an intersectional approach; an approach that cannot be even 
contemplated without positioning the question in the wider political framework of 
European immigration policy and socio -historical dimensions of such policies.  
 
This case study also aims to open the discussion to a more detailed and dee per level of 
analysis of intersections of data justice. Here, thematic analysis has been used to 
demonstrate the interconnections between different instances of injustice, but other 
qualitative methods might have provided the case study with other concepti ons of how 
these links are formed and maintained. For example, a discursive analysis of the social 
media posts could have shed light on the diversity of apprehensions of justice. Exploring and 
coding the social media content without emphasising one specifi c form of injustice, here 
spatial injustice, might have also brought about other interesting intersections using 
grounded theory.  
 
Other fundamental considerations on ‘power’ and ‘social structure’ could also change the 
analytic direction of this case stud y’s question and might lead to disparate theoretical 
discussions of data justice. One example is not to dichotomise power to “power of agency – 
“power to” – […and] structural power – “power over” (Heeks and Renken 2018, 97)  and 
rather treat power in a Foucauldian framework arguing that “power is everywhere” and 
“comes from everywhere” (Foucault 1998, 63) . What would such an understanding of 
power mean for an intersectional analysis of data justice? Another thread of thought could 
be followed in theorising data s ystems (Kitchin and Lauriault 2018)  or surveillance (Haggerty 
and Ericson 2000)  as an assemblage containing a “multiplicity of heterogeneous objects, 
whose unity comes solely from the fact that these items function together, that they “work” 
together as a functional entity” (Patton 1994, 158) . Using assemblage theory could also 
affect how resistance to intersectional data injustice is formulated, which includes not only 
the state as the hegemonic power in establishing surveillance discourses but also “a number 
of other agents, such as users, c ivil society, regional and international flows, technological 
advancements, things and code” (Akbari and Gabdulhakov 2019) . 
 
Finally, as claims to data justice cannot be addressed witho ut referring to political 
dispositions, research on data justice is also not exempt from such political repercussions. 
As a feminist activist and academic, writing about compulsory hijab without strong feelings 
is a cumbersome exercise. It is also a fine p olitical line to walk since the issue of hijab is by 
far not a local issue, but an international tool to criticise the political foundations of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. The controversy caused by the meeting between Masih Alinejad, 
the founder of White  Wednesdays’ Campaign and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (Radio 
Farda 2019)  is a bitter reminder that losing the political perspective in alleviating one case of 
injustice, can bring about other forms of injustice, if not more violence, war and insecurity.

Abstract  
 
With the ongoing trend of urban datafication and growing use of data/evidence to shape 
developmental initiatives by state as well as non -state actors, this exploratory case study 
engages with the complex and often contested domains of da ta use. This study uses on -the-
ground experience of working with informal settlements in Indian cities to examine how 
information value chains work in practice and the contours of their power to intervene in 
building an agenda of social justice into govern ance regimes. Using illustrative examples 
from ongoing action -oriented projects of Mahila Housing Trust in India such as the Energy 
Audit Project, Slum Mapping Exercise and women -led climate resilience building under the 
Global Resilience Partnership, it r aises questions about challenges of making effective 
linkages between data, knowledge and action in and for slum communities in the global 
South by focussing on two issues.  
 
First, it reveals dilemmas of achieving data accuracy when working with slum commu nities 
in developing cities where populations are dynamically changing, and where digitisation and 
use of ICT has limited operational currency. The second issue focuses on data ownership. It 
foregrounds the need for complementary inputs and the heavy requi rement for  support 
systems in  informal settlements in order to translate data -driven knowledge into actionable 
forms. Absence of these will blunt the edge of data -driven community participation in local 
politics. Through these intersecting streams, the stu dy attempts to address how 
entanglements between southern urbanism, datafication, governance and social justice 
diversify the discourse on data justice. It highlights existing hurdles and structural 
hierarchies within a data -heavy developmental register em ergent across multiple cities in 
the global South where data -driven governmental regimes interact with convoluted urban 
forms and realities.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88

 4A. Introduction  
 
Of late, governance regimes in the global South have been increasingly enamoured by the 
reach of  data, digitisation and documentation in order for the state to see, regulate and 
govern its citizens (Scott 1999). In Benign Dataveillance - the New Kind of Democracy? , Payal 
Arora (2019) illustrates some of these rising impulses through the ongoing biometrically -
driven and database -led Unique Identification Number (UID) project in India for citizen 
documentation; and the Social Credits system in China that crosslinks citizenry’s online and 
offline activity to rewards or punitive action on the  basis of their credit scores. While such 
reconfigurations within governance as a way of producing level playing fields and pushing 
the agenda of equity remain questionable, what continues to intrigue is the way in which 
the process of datafication is bein g made an indispensable precursor to the discourse on the 
future of governance.  
 
As one of the biggest digital projects in India if not the world, UID, popularly called 
Aadhaar13 is hailed as a technological overhaul of welfare scheme targeting and direct 
benefit transfers. Scholars argue that “Aadhaar may not only enable efficient design, 
delivery, monitoring and evaluation of services…[..]..but may also offer the possibility of 
using modern data analytics and machine learning techniques for finding large -scale 
correlations in user data. This, in turn, may facilitate an improved design of social policy 
strategies, including targeting, and early detection and warning systems for anomalies” 
(Banerjee 2017). Yet at the same time, the scheme has courted both de bate and protests on 
issues of privacy, security and exclusionary biases.  
 
Likewise in specific relation to urban governance, the rally towards data -driven decision 
making is being pitched as a means to reform policy and better deliver on urban 
development goals. The Smart Cities Mission launched by India’s central government in 
2015 is one such initiative towards using big data for urban governance and administration, 
with ambitions spanning from rationalising traffic routes through GIS to predi ctive profiling 
for surveillance. Given that the world of big data is known to cast such long shadows, why 
does it continue to have such resonance with decision -making bodies? What hopes are we 
pinning on data for fairness of outcomes and the future of equ ity? 
 
Anticipating Risk? Thinking Data?  
 
We face unprecedented rates of urbanisation in the world, with cities across Africa, Central 
and Latin America, and most of Asia carrying the lion’s share of this burden. This brings an 
urgent need for mitigation ag ainst risk susceptibility and for social equity, without which the 
sustainability of these cities will fall into question. India, China and Nigeria will cumulatively 
account for 35% of the projected growth in the world’s urban population between 2018 and 
2050. In absolute numbers, 2050 projections estimate that India will add another 416 
million urban dwellers, while China will contribute 255 million and Nigeria 189 million (UN 
2018). In addition to a rising urban population, demands for energy and water wi ll also be 
 
13 Aadhaar is based on the e tymological pla y on  the word ‘basis’ or ‘foundation’ with Sanskrit origins. For 
citizens in India, it is a biometrically -tagged 12 -digit number unique to each individual that is being designed as 
a way to identify and document persons.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88

 peaking and that too in much shorter time frames. By 2030, global demand for energy and 
water will see an expected growth of 40 and 50 per cent respectively (UN 2016).  
 
While current estimates point out that 1 in 4 will live in a slum by 2030, t his scenario is 
bleaker for developing countries where inadequacy of shelter will be a reality for every third 
urban resident. Hence the urban poor residing in informal settlements and slums in cities of 
the global South are highly vulnerable to resource s carcity and risk. Whether it may be 
incremental changes and stresses like heat stress, pollution, poverty, induced weather 
extremities or natural disasters, what makes the urban poor in slums particularly susceptible 
to risks is “lack of secure land tenure , lack of access to basic infrastructure and services, and 
overcrowding” (World Bank 2011:45).  
 
For those on the veritable margins, data is being heralded as the tool that can give them 
visibility in discourses where they may have remained so far unaccount ed. In the case of 
India with a population of 65 million slum residents, the potential for producing actionable 
data to reduce poverty and effect change is immense. After over six decades of tepid 
responses of centrally -funded welfare schemes and poverty r eduction measures, countries 
like India are stepping into the domain of data with the hope and intent of catalysing new 
modalities of urban governance and of addressing the scarcity and risk that these vulnerable 
populations will increasingly face. While t he promise of ICTs as a fast mover was first 
envisioned some decades ago, the current push for data -driven governance and ‘marking’ 
citizens has been galvanised by the promise of digitising platforms, services and 
records/archives. For ‘invisible’ slums, w hose insecure tenure and non -networked nature 
may often keep them off official maps and city plans, this could provide the possibility of a 
crucial break.  
 
We already know, though, that achieving the potential of urban data will not be all plain 
sailing. A nanya Roy (2009), for example, notes exception, informality and invisibility as not 
gaps within but modalities of planning itself. In cities of global South, these often come to 
be used as purposive instruments to manage the failure of planned developmenta lism. To 
demand visibility is thus a political negotiation against exclusionary discourse of planning 
and policy. While invisibility may provide temporary tenure and allow life to go on under the 
nose of the state; to make oneself apparent, to demand or ne gotiate for visibility is a 
political move against being enumerated on terms in which one may have no say (Warner 
2013). Thus slums confront the city and often remind it of many cities that live within it.  
 
Creating and collating data about slums and groun ding the origins of this data with the 
community can push the envelope by providing visibility and adding further granularity to 
what is known about these areas; an essential foundation to proofing them against a future 
of risk. Yet government and municipa l authorities have been faced with the temptation to 
enumerate and mark residents of informal settlements in limited ways, and the challenge of 
going further than this. Linnet Taylor (2017) argues that in low -income environments 
accuracy and granularity of  data capture remains a practical difficulty for government 
authorities and urban local bodies. This is very much a reality for Indian cities which have 
high density slums that are constantly under the process of incremental building and have a 
high rate o f attrition (Ghertner 2016).

 So, while the promise of data -driven decision -making is real, what does this mean in 
everyday practice? First, as just noted, there are challenges in the very process of collecting 
and analysing data, such as the complexity of  capturing the details of dense slums in Indian 
cities and the political implications of this process. But more importantly, even if such data 
can be gathered, there are real -time dilemmas and impediments in making use of it for 
evidence -based civic partic ipation. Thus, analysing the issues that plague this practice 
especially for communities residing in informal settlements in the global South not only has 
potential to improve operational efficiency of processes but also to better deliver on goals 
of socia l equity and justice.  
 
Mahila Housing Trust (MHT) is an Ahmedabad -based NGO that has been working with slum 
communities for over two decades in areas of habitat upgradation, improving livelihoods 
and productivity, and building climate resilience. Over the course of the last 25 years, MHT 
has attempted to create both broad -range and particularised data to understand the 
demographics and deliver on the needs of communities and households in informal 
settlements across eight states in India. With a deeply embe dded community -based and 
community -led model, MHT’s on -ground practice attempts to realise this process of moving 
from data to knowledge and subsequently to action not only ‘in’ but ‘with’ slum 
communities.  
 
In partnering with communities, there is a delib erate push for obtaining data of high 
contextual accuracy but this simultaneously makes maintaining data quality increasingly 
complex. A similar dichotomy exists with using ICT in countries like India where urban slum 
areas and smaller towns are still deve loping the means to conquer digital divides and patchy 
telecommunication capacities. Tussles over data ownership and agenda -setting roadblocks 
continue to structure outcomes of data -driven decision making for slum communities on 
individual and collective s cales.  
 
Given these challenges, the central questions of this case study focus on two core issues 
within the larger spectrum of concerns for data justice. First, issues of accuracy, digitising 
data and the use of ICT; and second, issues of ownership and tr anslating data -driven 
knowledge into actionable forms. Through these, this case study engages with the existing 
discourse on data justice and attempts to bring out real -time challenges of the process of 
data creation and the potential held in producing act ionable data that communities may use 
in making governance and planning processes more accountable.  
 
The subsequent section elaborates on the central analytical framework used in this study 
i.e. the ‘information value chain’ adapted from the work of Richar d Heeks and Satyarupa 
Shekhar (Heeks and Shekhar 2019). Details on the methodology used for developing the 
study are presented in the following section. Findings detail how barriers and real -time 
challenges emerging from on -ground practice structure pro -equity development initiatives 
in order to reflect on the information value chain in practice from the context of developing 
cities in India. Reflections emerging from the case study analysis are presented in the 
concluding section with recommendations for a  future agenda.

 4B. Background  
 
Scholars and policymakers have acknowledged that developmental agendas in the 
contemporary world have moved on from being merely informed to being driven by data 
(Taylor 2017). Despite this technological overhaul in structuring the governmental agenda, 
the domain of data and its potency can be circumscribed for many parts of the population. 
Cross linking, mining and deploying data carries risks of further exclusions and reinforcing 
inequalities especially for those on  the margins. For instance, who gets framed as key 
perpetrators in the data on air quality in Delhi indicates not just the stakes but also the 
politics of data representation and speaks of the power inscribed within the collection and 
presentation of large -scale digital datasets. In the process of datafication, a farmer can be a 
data point divorced from issues of soil salinity, ground water shortage or crop failure, as 
s/he seems located within a system but divorced from its structural deprivations. In the 
process of assigning blame for air quality in the capital, does the responsibility of inner -city 
industries producing noxious fumes or private motorised vehicular traffic get subsumed in 
the larger narrative of pollution spikes due to stubble burning by fa rmers in North India? 
Who gets penalised in legal proceedings may often flow from the results of these 
representations; and in this case lead to hefty penalties on the middle - and small -scale 
farmers who supply Delhi with its grains (Mukerjee and Goswami 2 016).  
 
The ability of data to frame narratives or drive agendas speaks of a larger ecosystem and 
how it interacts with the core data processes of any initiative, project or information 
system. Those core data processes can be understood as an ‘information value chain’ (see 
Figure 1). The information value chain model used by Heeks and Shekhar (2019) visualises 
the process of datafication with its constituents at upstream, midstream and downstream 
stages.

Larger structural realities and socio -economic vectors sit around these core data processes.  
They not merely influence information value chains but get consequently shaped by the 
results and outcomes of information produced through datafication. The entan gled nature 
of data and broader contextual reality thus urges a deeper look into the upstream (e.g. 
needs, tools and collection processes), midstream (e.g. processing and analysis), and

 downstream (e.g. decision making, action plan dissemination and enactm ent) components 
of the information value chain. These can therefore be seen to either counter or reinforce 
discrimination, redress or perpetuate invisibility for those without social privileges, 
empower communities or sever their rights, etc.  
 
What can dat a justice mean in such a scenario? Richard Heeks and Jaco Renken define data 
justice as “the primary ethical standard by which data -related resources, processes and 
structures are evaluated” (Heeks and Renken 2018:92). They break this down into different 
dimensions like instrumental data justice (fair use of data and its outcomes), procedural 
data justice (fair handling and management of data), distributive data justice (fair 
distribution of data). Threading Amartya Sen’s capability approach within this ide a imparts 
agency and emphasises the interlinkages of data/evidence and decision making to improve 
life opportunities ( ibid. ). An information value chain hence functions and thrives within an 
ecosystem of social action, interest groups and other external fa ctors which all come to bear 
on the production, operation and outcome of the value chain.  
 
While the information value chain model (Heeks and Shekhar 2019) provides a central 
framework for this study, the arguments presented here build upon how this might work in 
real-time practice and what that could mean when one speaks of data justice. It attempts to 
foreground the dynamics of heterogeneous experiences of ICT and digital reach, iterative 
datafication techniques, and limitations in human proficiency  for turning data/evidence into 
action. These are issues that remain true for a wide majority of slum residents in Indian 
cities and hold an overarching influence in not just the data outcomes but the process of 
datafication itself. A capability or a choic e to shape data outcomes may be highly varied 
across different locational and socio -economic contexts; not just for individuals but 
organisations like MHT itself which attempt to strike balances between pro -poor advocacy 
and producing unbiased data sets.  
 
What this effectively suggests is the urgent need to ensure data use is open, accountable, 
effective and responsible especially when data intermediaries (organisations working in the 
zone between the state and the citizens) frame and actualise pro -data equ ity initiatives. 
Linnet Taylor notes that, “the framing of data justice … operates at the highest level – where 
the social contract is shaped and negotiated – and at the most basic, in the practices of 
everyday … life” (Taylor 2017:11). Given this all -enco mpassing influence in an increasingly 
datafying milieu, there remains a significant need and potential for building “ethical paths” 
(Taylor 2017:2) and embedding a social justice agenda within the larger ecosystem of 
datafying developmental regimes (Taylor  2017, Heeks and Renken 2018). In the case of 
action -oriented projects being run for and/or in slum communities, this takes on particular 
forms and challenges.  
 
Given the digital divide and existing socio -structural hierarchies, data related issues – who 
collects the data, for what purpose, using what tools for collection, with what level of 
participation of the community and what availability and openness of data sets, how data is 
framed or harvested, and what balance exists between privacy and representat ion and 
between accuracy and manipulation – all shed light on the multiple intersecting streams of 
contestation that lie across the information value chain. While discussing Bowker and Star’s 
idea of efficacious systems, Taylor extrapolates that a good, us able system becomes so Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
94 
 convenient that it disappears and only its answers remain (Taylor 2017:6). Similarly, the 
‘work’ in a data -driven world carries a messy underbelly of stakes, interests, costs and 
controls which catalyse processes even as they remain in the foreground; while the 
information they hold travels and is harnessed across different contexts or purposes.  
 
While it remains impossible to eliminate the effects of all of these challenges, using a data 
justice framework allows for bringing self -reflexivity into working with/through data. Hence 
this study uses the information value chain as a starting point to analyse data -justice -in-
practice by reflecting upon interventions and action -oriented projects. The two core issues it 
identifies attempt to h ighlight the complexities at two different stages within the 
information value chain from the perspective of slums and their residents in India (see 
Figure 2). The first issue is of data accuracy and digitisation of data that pertains to the 
upstream compo nents of information value chains. The second – focussing on downstream 
issues – is that of linking data ownership to the community as well as the challenges faced 
and potential unlocked in harnessing data/evidence.

 4C. Methods  
 
A combination of secondary and primary research is employed for the purposes of the 
study. The key framing issues and literature review is carried out through a secondary 
analysis of some key literature around data justice as a conceptual category and a modular 
form. In addition, the study is pivoted on a critical evaluation of Mahila Housing Trust’s own 
experience of working with data through examining illustrative examples, experiences and 
on-ground learning from three key projects:  
 
• Slum Mapping Exercise in Ranchi (ongoing):  The project was a slum boundaries, 
infrastructure and service delivery indicator mapping exercise done via community 
participation in order to produce digitised, updated and geo -tagged maps for 20 
informal settlements which have remained largely invisible  to date within urban 
governance in the city. The process was based on translating paper maps made via 
community collaboration and household -level data collected via mobile apps by trained 
MHT personnel onto geo -referenced formats for community awareness a nd 
mobilisation as well as public advocacy.  
 
• Energy Audits in Ahmedabad (ongoing):  The Energy Audit project is a community -led 
energy mapping exercise where women leaders from the community (trained by MHT) 
in Ahmedabad collect household data about energy expenditure and requirements. 
Post -analysis, families from informal settlements were provided with customised 
solutions through microloans, energy -efficient products and suggestions based on their 
household layout, need and capacity to pay. The collection was carried out by 
community women through audit tools and paper -based surveys processed and 
analyzed at MHT with the onus of decision making and action plans on the community 
itself. The project aimed to ultimately develop the capacities of community -base d 
organisations to monitor and maintain infrastructure involving them in meter reading 
and the supply and payment of bills.  
 
• Global Resilience Partnership Challenge (GRP) -supported project building climate 
resilience for the urban poor (2015 -17): The proje ct titled “Women's Action towards 
Climate Resilience for Urban Poor” was run in seven cities of South Asia to co -create 
data and action plans on housing typologies, climate risk and current conditions at the 
household and slum level. Collected through mobi le apps and shared with the 
community, it allowed for them to create community -level plans and mobilise towards 
ensuring public accountability.  
 
Primary evidence on challenges and reflections on data justice in practice was collected 
through qualitative re search tools such as unstructured interviews and focus group 
discussions (FGDs). All primary work was conducted between January -April 2019. The FGDs 
were targeted towards three different levels of data 'agents' or stakeholders within the 
organisation, each  of whom play vital roles in shaping project design, what kinds of data we 
seek, what tools are used to handle and secure the data, but also shaping how data is 
circulated and used.  
 Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
96 
 These levels correspond to: on -ground field team, data management team, a nd senior 
management at MHT. The field team is the key data gathering unit and works closely with 
the community. For the purposes of this study, the field team from MHT’s local office in 
Ranchi in Jharkhand was involved due to the challenging, diverse and wide -ranging project 
portfolio of ongoing projects at that location. The data management team not only design 
research tools and survey timelines but perform various upstream and downstream tasks 
like ensuring training of surveyors, aiming for maintenance of research ethics in the field, 
handling software and back -end processes, checking and cleaning data, and handling its 
analysis and presentation. They include a variety of consultants and outside experts as per 
the need of the project and mostly work out of the head office in Ahmedabad. The team has 
been moving towards centralising databases through an MIS system for ease of operations 
and higher consistency.  
 
The third nodal point for FGDs was the senior management who set agendas and steer the 
work of ou r projects and organisation at large. These may include but are not limited to 
those who are in direct contact with donors, policy makers, sector experts, researchers, etc. 
This level includes those key members from MHT who decide what data may be needed, 
how the data reports may be presented and shared, and how knowledge that is produced 
through our work gets disseminated.  
 
 
4D. Findings  
 
4D1. ‘Fixing them on the maps’  
 
The moving parts of a machine often determine its collective function but to unpack the  
‘process’ of datafication is to grapple with an emergent form whose life and creation remain 
inherently under flux. What happens if the idea of a norm is no longer static but shifting due 
to the realities in which it is achieved? How and where does one se t a benchmark or fix data 
points? The question of defining data accuracy presents such dilemmas in the practice of 
creating data for slums in Indian cities where discontinuity and inconsistency often puncture 
the idea of achieving accuracy.  
 
In many smalle r Indian cities that are still transitioning from predominantly rural to urban 
forms, like their counterparts elsewhere in the global South, informal settlements due to 
the insecurity of their tenure and disrupted domesticity either fall off the map or rem ain 
hard to capture. They continually mutate or incrementally build in relationship with the 
externalities they encounter from eviction, heat stress, civil strife to disasters, etc (e.g. 
Chandran 2019). To capture these marginalised communities and aim for  data accuracy 
through the use of ICT remains equal parts potential and challenge. To use community 
participation as a means of improving accuracy and create data from the ground up can 
provide added granularity to GIS maps or drone mapping that may rely s olely on remote 
sensing or official survey maps. However the experience of immersive fieldwork and 
community involvement also raises concerns over local conflicts, exposure to induced 
errors, and technological hurdles in remote locations which posit accura cy as not an 
unattainable but a shifting norm.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
97 
  
For instance, we can take MHT’s experience in the ongoing slum mapping exercise in Ranchi 
undertaken through a complementary process of field -based studies and subsequent 
digitisation of slum surveys and ser vice mapping via GIS. This illustrates some of the 
dilemmas in seeking to ensure data justice. Essentially the project was devised as an 
iterative process of following four stages (see Figure 3). The first stage involved immersive 
fieldwork and iterative p rocesses to map slum boundaries and enumerate households. 
While the slum boundary mapping was a collaborative effort between field teams from MHT 
and community residents, the household -level data was collected by trained field surveyors 
from the organisati on itself. The next stage involved digitising these into geo -tagged 
formats. To this another layer of data was overlaid by collecting information about 
household particulars and service levels within the community. In the fourth stage, this 
information was  collated, verified and presented in the form of digitised slum maps for 
communities which have remained on the margins of state discourses and planning 
paradigms, in order to initiate public advocacy and to initiate community -led demands upon 
the state fo r civic entitlements in informal settlements.  
Figure 1. Steps for slum mapping in Ranchi in MHT's ongoing Slum Mapping project  
 
The slum mapping exercise in Ranchi was highly dependent on community knowledge to 
establish settlement boundaries and service deficiencies in the settlements for enabling 
service provision and furthering advocacy. While a participatory exercise improved chances 
of community control over how their reality was captured, this came at a cost where hi gher 
chances of inducing manual error, the environment with slums, and attrition rates all 
shaped outcomes. MHT’s Ranchi field team explained that problems arose from a range of 
issues. Illegal subdividing of houses for rental yields kept changing total nu mbers of houses 
for each slum as new doors and temporary partitions often sprang up in subsequent visits to 
the same slum. Locked houses due to seasonal migration or high incidence of daily wage 
labour left verification processes reliant on secondary and t ertiary sources which often 
became the neighbours or village -level officers who had little idea about the on -ground 
situation. Topographical inaccessibility such as open drains and low -level areas which were 
flood -prone also made coverage of entire settlem ents and in -person investigation harder 
especially during monsoons. Organic street networks and fuzzy settlement boundaries due 
to constantly building and shifting within the settlement made fixing street segmentation 
and clear boundaries on digitised form ats an inherently unfinished business.  
 
In these cases triangulation of data gathering became necessary (for instance, asking 
respondents, cross -checking with neighbours and via personal observation).  But surveyors 
were often put in decision -making dilemm as, whether their intervention towards achieving 
accuracy meant inducing bias as a corollary to reducing error. Illegal service connections 
were observed and often reported by field teams in cases where a true picture at the slum 
level would benefit from r eporting the truth about the household -level picture. Field STAGE 1 -

 officers also noted higher accuracy in household -level data when slum residents perceived 
that they would be beneficiaries of targeted projects rather than participating in 
background exercises fo r advocacy such as the slum mapping exercise. The field teams 
stated that they operated on a 70 -90% confidence level in terms of data accuracy where 
micro details may only be gathered through using proxy indicators and/or attempting 
triangulation through a sking the respondent, their neighbour and self -observation. ‘Fixing 
them on the maps’ and ‘making the maps’ were hurdles which were constantly being 
negotiated in the field.  
 
As a data intermediary, working in local contexts also meant dealing with low tec hnological 
proficiency and testing field conditions. The potential of digitising information about slums 
through ICT faced high barriers in Ranchi where network issues, limited literacy of field 
surveyors and respondents as well as geographical inaccessibi lity produced impediments to 
creation of data and to translating data into legible and actionable forms. Patchy mobile 
network connectivity and use of basic devices often led to time lags and poor records of 
locational accuracy during geo -tagging procedure s. For instance household -level surveys 
were often backlogged due to unavailability of data services in informal settlements in the 
periphery of the city. It also resulted in delayed updating of survey forms and in extreme 
cases, mobile device operating sy stem crashes or jumbling of back -end data.  
 
Building staff capacity and maintaining trust with communities was and remains an ongoing 
challenge. For MHT, building community trust has been a core focus which entails a long 
drawn -out period of informal field  visits, interacting with the community and understanding 
their needs as well as laying foundations for building community -based organisations in the 
informal settlements across Ranchi where MHT is working. This initial trust -building process 
takes around 3-6 months and usually precedes the project or other need -based collecting of 
data.  If absent, it can lead to sources of bias and inaccuracy. From MHT’s experience, it is 
increasingly apparent that data accuracy is directly proportional to levels of mutua l trust 
and intended benefits. Field teams noted that residents of informal settlements shared 
more accurate data when they have familiarity with and trust the surveyors / organisation.  
 
Women -led teams also encountered hostility and uncomfortable situatio ns at times. Cases 
were reported of catcalling as well as questioning of women surveyors by male slum 
residents who were drunk and/or felt threatened by the presence of female surveyors in 
their settlement collecting data. This forced the organisation to h ave male members within 
the team in order to ensure safety. Such involuntary considerations as well as disruptions in 
the field not only increased the time lag in data collection but also bore financial 
consequences for the project. A detailed flowchart of  the challenges faced at each step is 
presented in the Appendix.  
 
Experiences from practice urge a rethinking of the idea of data accuracy: not as a static 
benchmark but a shifting norm structured by the on -ground realities including its emergent 
milieu a nd conflicting stakeholder interests especially in areas whose ontology is constantly 
under flux. While the community felt empowered in terms of participating in creating data 
and being visible, there still remained discomfort and hesitation in sharing hou sehold -level 
information due to the perceived illegality of their status. Use of ICT facilitated digitisation 
processes but led to entry level barriers and operational hindrances for local research teams Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
99 
 and the community. Overcoming processual lags and en suring validity was thus an 
incremental effort which was enabled through purposive decision making and multiple 
rounds of cleaning and re -verification. Inducing bias during datafication was wagered 
against presenting a real -time picture of informal settlem ents and their needs, while 
minimising their exposure to punitive action from state and non -state actors.  
 
How context itself shapes the benchmark for data accuracy reveals the contested territory 
of fixing data while working with information value chains.  It reveals that the structural data 
justice framework holds up a more destabilised and messy world of iterative processes and 
interactions within action -oriented projects in informal settlements where feedback loops, 
hierarchies of knowledge and technique , and constant shifts shape more than just the form 
that data takes.  
 
4D2. Data ownership and translating data/evidence into action  
 
Another central focus for data justice discourse has been ensuring that ownership and 
control of the data created about ind ividuals and communities remains accessible, 
understandable and actionable for them, in contrast to the intentions for big data. For 
Taylor (2017), who advocates building ethical paths in a datafying milieu, balancing between 
integrating the freedom to be seen and represented appropriately with the freedom to be 
unseen and free from intervention remains a central concern and in practice, a constant 
challenge. With the marketplace for data expanding drastically – making data one of the 
most precious and pote nt commodities in the world today – democratising its access and 
routes to its use for shaping outcomes has become even more indispensable. Data 
intermediaries, especially those working for developmental and pro -equity initiatives, need 
to push for ensurin g that communities remain a vital stakeholder in not just generating but 
owning and using the data generated through them, even if translating data/evidence into 
actionable forms may prove to be a variegated experience. Community empowerment is 
pivotal in translating data/evidence into actionable form: merely making data/evidence 
available to a community does not necessarily translate into desired action.  
 
What are the real possibilities of creating data ownership amongst communities? 
Additionally can we re think slum residents as integral parts of information value chains at 
different stages: from upstream catalysts like research surveyors to data/evidence -driven 
action agents? Experiences from ongoing projects provide a highly diverse scenario in this 
regar d with every project, location and context defining its own set of hierarchies, hurdles 
and possibilities.  
 
The energy audit project run by MHT in cities like Ahmedabad provides an interesting 
example. As part of the project, MHT trains women leaders from slum communities to work 
as energy auditors in the households within their communities where they audit households 
on the basis of their energy usage by generating and collating data on electricity bills, 
consumption and family preferences. The auditing to ol they use maps the existing layout of 
the interior of a dwelling and the light sources and spatial use given many dwellings also 
double as workspaces for their residents. This mapping helped the women leaders 
themselves and family members of the househol ds in question to understand how they 
used their home spaces for different ac tivities. Improvements are then suggested in the Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
100 
 location of light points e.g. splitting the light points to give focused brightness but using 
lower wa ttage sources.  
 
Up to this p oint, MHT has trained a group of nine women across Ahmedabad, who now 
work as energy auditors for their community. While on the one hand the training 
empowered community members in creating and analysing their own energy needs, the 
communities remain depen dent on trained experts and architects on second -order issues 
such as devising layout -based solutions for each household. The process strengthened the 
community in domains of awareness and decision making at the household level as it 
prioritised the involv ement and needs of the families it aimed to study and benefit. The 
initial gains on data/evidence -driven action were taking shape through decision making on 
energy consumption and shifts being made on the level of the household to tackle heat 
stress, venti lation and low lighting issues as well as improvement in storage capacity and 
spatial usage within the household unit. By keeping the process and solution localised and 
indicative rather than directive, the families and community had greater control over t he 
data -driven solutions they wanted to experiment with and invest in. Most of the data 
collection was still done through paper and usage of electrical equipment such as 
voltmeters required significant external support. Local identities, politics and socio -
economic conditions still held a significant impact on what action could stem from the 
awareness that is generated.  
 
Additionally these energy auditors also introduce low -cost, energy -efficient solutions and 
products manufactured by MHT through subsidised  means. Through its network of women 
energy auditors, MHT has sold sustainable energy products such as LED lights, smokeless 
cook stoves, solar lanterns and solar lighting, and cooling systems to more than 27,500 slum 
families across 10 cities in India. Ye t this network made the women in the community 
answerable and accountable to the organisation. The data being collected was held in a 
central repository at MHT which had the final say on its usage. The process of democratising 
all the way along the informa tion value chain hence remains far from over and requires 
more work. Even while one domain may acquire more openness or robustness, others 
produced new hierarchies in terms of how data was processed or where it was sought to be 
deployed.  
 
While the energy audit process trains community women to recognise and devise solutions 
for rationalising their energy needs at household and neighbourhood level, the umbrella 
project for women -led climate resilience building under the Global Resilience Partnership 
(2015 -17) pushed the agenda of data/evidence -driven civic participation further along the 
road to achieving data justice. Based on evaluating, harnessing and improving community 
capacity in seven cities across South Asia14, the project, with its process methodology 
detailed in Figure 4, was designed to shift the sustainability quotient and driving gear of the 
datafication and action planning process into the hands of the community. The project was 
conceptualised to ensure:

Bangladesh.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88

 If the urban poor are provided with the requisite knowledge to undertake 
vulnerability and risk assessments and are equipped with accessible resilient  
technologies, they will be able to devise and implement locally relevant and pro -poor 
climate resilient solutions. If the poor are empo wered to implement their own 
resilience plans, and the institutional mechanisms representing their voices are in 
place, they will be able to better influence city planning and governance on pro -poor 
adaptation and resilience action  (MHT 2017:ii)  
 
 
 
Figure  4. Methodology for carrying out MHT's climate resilience building 
programme at community level under GRP  
Premised on building community -based organisations (CBOs) and their active proponents 
called community action groups (CAGs) at the slum level, communi ty participation was 
central in each stage from collecting data to training to negotiation of action agendas by 
interacting with local municipal authorities. The GRP project allowed community action 
groups to form community -based action plans for each site  according to their own priorities 
against the identified risks of water inundation, flooding, heat stress and vector -borne 
diseases. Use of data/evidence in setting priorities – not just for local decision making but 
for improving governance – pivoted on motivating and externally supporting community 
mobilisation based on data/evidence at the slum level which was being generated for the 
first time and pushing them to urge for inclusivity in local governance.  
 
Some of the success towards this goal includ ed community leaders from slums in 
Ahmedabad being made stakeholders in devising municipal authority Heat Action Plans; in 
Bhopal they were invited by the city municipality’s Malaria Department to undertake vector 
surveillance in other slums; whereas in Ra nchi community leaders managed to push for 
including rainwater harvesting incentives in local implementation of the national -level 
housing policy, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. The women in the community were slowly 
trained to identify and understand technic al terms and conceptual categories like climate 
Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
102 
 change, risk, heat stress, vector -borne diseases, green roof – ideas that will permeate into 
the memory and vocabulary of the community over a longer, more sustained period of time. 
New initiatives such as cl imate saathis  (partners) and child doctors were instituted to 
involve adolescents within the community.  
 
Despite the positive response from the community and growing platforms for them to 
interact in local governance, many challenges still remain. The GRP programme provided the 
first push towards participatory processes where slum communities could interact with 
government to demand entitlements or better provisions but requires scaling for this effect 
to bring a significant change in how communication chan nels in local contexts are 
structured. The research design for a major portion of the household data collection 
exercise was undertaken by MHT’s research teams who collected, collated and analysed the 
datasets produced cross multiple sites. A significant a mount of training and external support 
remained necessary throughout and after the project in measuring and collating 
temperature variations, or maintenance of equipment for installed green roofs and modular 
roofs.  
 
While the community members played a par ticipatory role in producing data and deciding 
what forms it could take while translating evidence into community -level action plans as 
was envisioned in the initial project design, their role in taking it to the level of participation 
in local governance remained dependent on MHT’s support, from organising women leaders 
to fixing meetings or creating platforms for engagement. On different occasions, 
interactions between stakeholders at meetings with local authorities had to be facilitated by 
MHT. Often the  agenda setting and modes of intervening in local decision making were 
devised at the organisational level and diffused into community meetings, later being picked 
up by them and pursued depending on their feasibility.  
 
Additionally while data collection a nd action plans still possessed an active component of 
co-creation at the community level, the downstream channel of data dissemination was 
narrower than desired due to logistical issues and privacy concerns. As a result, collated 
datasets were managed and  remained with MHT itself even if their broad results were used 
by the community members. While data justice aims to close the loop on accessibility and 
dissemination of data/evidence for the communities who may be represented through it, 
deficits in terms  of organisational planning about how this could be made available to them 
as well as prevalence of digital illiteracy amongst slum residents hampered the cause of 
open access and free use of post -analysis trends and evidence on risk and resilience 
capacit y. 
 
As illustrative examples, both the energy audit and GRP project present different scales and 
modes of how slum residents generated data/evidence and participated in decision making. 
For the energy audits, data creation and its concerted use was squarel y at household and 
community level. This made the transition to action comparatively easier. The local 
dynamics and household considerations determined interactions and responses, where 
dependence on organisational support for technical proficiency and sol utions remained 
considerable. In this case, the field surveyor, data analyst and decision maker are all from 
and within the community – a relatively rare scenario. This was enabled through 
empowering and training the community. While these required high MH T involvement in Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
103 
 the primary stages, it eased community reach and closing of the loop from knowledge to 
action.  
 
With GRP, the community’s dependence on MHT for understanding issues, building and 
mobilising the community, and catalysing their interactions with city -level decision makers 
remained significant. Results for data analysis were shared with the community but the 
collated and analysed databases were held at the organisation level. Even while these 
remained accessible for community members, making t hem practically usable has remained 
challenging due their digitised form. Demonstrative results from the analysed data such as 
results from water testing or vector -eradication drives was what the community largely 
relied on to understand and prioritise the ir resilience strategies. As complexity of data 
collection, analysis and decision -making process increases, community participation and 
ownership becomes harder to ensure yet necessary for enabling free and fair use of data; 
i.e. necessary for data justice . 
 
 
4E. Discussion and Conclusions  
 
The projects and experiences from the field provide insights on both upstream and 
downstream issues of information value chains. The slum mapping exercise in Ranchi brings 
in contextual learnings relevant to similar loca tions undergoing rural -urban transitions and 
seeing high rates of attrition and incremental building in informal settlements. Their 
location and topographical conditions produce challenges of access for fieldworkers and for 
fixing them in digitised and geo -tagged formats with cohesiveness and complete accuracy. 
In addition, high political stakes and tenure insecurity drive communities to make conflicting 
or inconsistent claims that push field researchers to triangulate data and make choices 
between correcti ng or inducing bias. The upstream stages of information value chains 
remain extremely entangled in practice i.e. moving back and forth due to procedural and 
ethical dilemmas of fixing accuracy. Further, digital divides and limited diffusion of ICT have 
mea nt that it often creates hurdles for both researchers and the community in 
implementing research as well as translating information into action. Hurdles such as low 
network connectivity, limited ICT diffusion and low digital literacy change the discursive 
domain of what can be achieved in the course of enumerating and mapping slums.  
 
On the other hand, experiences from practice in the energy audit programme and GRP 
project help reflect on how issues of data ownership and challenges to data -driven civic 
engagement shape the downstream effects of information value chain operations. While  
the energy audit was at the settlement level and improved chances of keeping the 
information value chain operation grounded and community -led, on macro, multi -city scales 
like those in GRP this became harder. Slum communities in Ahmedabad needed support a nd 
handholding in enabling action through data/evidence -driven negotiations. Socio -economic 
conditions, gender biases, literacy levels, and digital illiteracy continue to be entry barriers 
in pushing for desired outcomes. Creating chances for data -driven c ivic engagement 
required ongoing organisational support and facilitation. Data ownership in the case of GRP 
at least remained circumscribed to the domains of intermediaries, research organisations or 
state actors. While this process of using data/evidence -driven action is getting Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
104 
 democratised, representation of macro data sets, rules for access and maintenance of e -
repositories remains harder to decentralise.  
 
Improving MHT’s own data and project documentation has also been a challenge that the 
organisation  continues to strive for. Building consistency in our data collection and handling 
will allow for better preparedness towards improving channels for access. In addition, 
another key learning from ensuring data justice in practice is to build the familiarit y and 
capacity of working with digital formats for those within the organisation as well as the 
communities. Developing technical knowhow and capacity building by intermediaries like 
MHT which work at grassroots level may be a step towards improve the abil ity of slum 
communities to effectively understand, handle and yield their data in future. Another 
learning has been towards developing data collection tools that incorporate multiple 
formats suitable to support triangulation. For instance, survey questionn aires for 
respondents that incorporate input media such as audio and taking geo -tagged photographs 
of locations improve data cleaning processes and accuracy levels.  
 
While the promise of data justice could restructure hierarchies, the new forms of 
dependen cies being created also need attention. For informal settlements in the global 
South not just digital literacy but literacy more generally remain an unfinished goal; yet a 
basic foundation for data justice in a digitising world. ICTs can play a role to dem ocratise and 
decentralise datafication processes but only if we move towards fairness of use and 
representation, and enable a rights -based discourse that balances the need to be seen with 
the right to determine how and the space to refuse. A contextually -grounded evaluation of 
the work of information value chains allows us to consider the domain of possibilities 
against contours of impediments, both of which remain inherent in the processes of a data -
driven environment. The discussion on data justice in MHT ’s case study runs across multiple 
registers. First, the case study allows us to engage with logistical or ethical concerns that 
emerge in practice such as dealing with concerns regarding efficacy versus limits of ensuring 
accuracy, and working in technolo gically -deficient locations or with conflicting interests. 
Second, the analysis of the projects illustrating data/evidence -driven engagement highlights 
how data can intervene in the lives led by the urban poor and in the challenges that 
continue to plague them.  
 
A future research agenda towards building data justice into practice needs to focus on 
better understanding of capacity -building interventions with communities; particularly 
identifying strategies for them to actively engage with and own the process  of creating 
actionable data for change. This requires them to be not merely providers of data but 
stakeholders in the process of envisioning data -driven civic engagement. Another key focus 
for future research will be scaling decentralised data initiatives . In small -scale or 
community -based projects such as energy auditing, there was considerable evidence to 
suggest that the envelope on data ownership and subsequent decision making was being 
pushed. However, this remained a challenge for macro -projects like  GRP. Building grounded 
frameworks and models for scaling interventions that aim for data justice in practice 
remains a necessary next step for a just and fair future.

Abstract  
 
How does data visibility affect vulnerable communities that face uncertainty over 
occupational rights? Or in other words, can data justice be realized in settings of acute 
resource injustice? These are the overarching questions that our case study interrog ates by 
opening up the black box of the community in the volatile and fast -transforming context of 
occupation rights on the peri -urban frontier. We examine the unfolding of data and 
information processes through the lens of enumeration and community mappin g exercises 
conducted in a low -income neighbourhood or basti  located in the fast -transforming peri -
urban fringe of Hyderabad, India. We argue that the realization of data justice is mediated 
by ‘information politics’, i.e., the ways in which informational resources, as well as the risks 
and rewards associated with them, are distributed across individual actors and identity 
groups within the community. In so doing, our case study underlines the importance of a 
structural understanding of data justice and als o suggests directions for embedding justice 
in data processes.

 5A. Introduction  
 
How does data visibility affect vulnerable communities in cities of the global South? Does 
the increasing prevalence of digital technologies help realize data justice in set tings of 
resource injustice? Or does it thwart it? While recent scholarship has examined data 
processes in low -income communities in the global South (Heeks & Shekhar 2019), this 
literature has often focused on issues of justice surrounding data processes in the 
relationship between the community and external actors. Our aim here is to open up the 
black box of the community to understand information flows within it, in order to 
understand attitudes about, and receptivity to, data collection exercises.  
 
The location of our study on the volatile peri -urban frontier of Hyderabad, in an area with 
little presence or activity of non -governmental organizations (NGOs) or community -based 
organizations (CBOs), allows a reckoning with the role of ‘leaders’ in mediating  these 
information flows. Thus, we take as our variable of interest not simply data, which is in 
some forms inaccessible to the innumerate and the illiterate, but the larger landscape of 
information. The assumption is that our empirically grounded approach  will generate 
insights into a range of questions at the heart of research on data justice in relation to 
access, receptivity and visibility.  
 
We focus on two adjacent but discrete communities: a basti  (slum) we call ‘Gachi Basti’ and 
a recently constructe d ‘transit’ housing complex, designated here as the Provisional Housing 
Complex (PHC).15 Together they accommodate approximately 1,800 residents, although lack 
of basic data about these communities, including population, motivated our decision to 
undertake  an enumeration survey (see below). Both families from the basti and current 
residents of the PHC have faced housing evictions in the last year. The trauma of these 
evictions, experienced by the evicted families but felt across the settlement, therefore 
provide the most immediate prism through which we engage with the questions of data and 
information justice. Our conceptual framework draws closely from the specificity of this 
setting, and we subscribe to Heeks and Renken’s (2018) position that a structural  approach 
offers an appropriate foundation for understanding data justice in a development context . 
 
In particular, our study demonstrates the need to embed the data justice framework within 
a broader understanding of the politics of information and resour ce access. From the 
perspective of distributive or rights -based justice, we focus on the right of the marginalized 
communities to continue to reside in their self -built settlement and their right to basic 
amenities provided by the state. In this way, our c onceptualization of distributive justice 
echoes the notion of a right to the city (Lefebvre 1996, Harvey 2003, Zérah et al 2011).  
 
Millions of India’s urban residents live in informal/illegal settlements. Although these areas 
cover a wide range of legal an d material situations, they are invariably under -serviced areas

circumstances of the basti dwellers.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88

 and home to the most socially and economically underprivileged urban residents.16 These 
citizens are increasingly integrated, voluntarily and involuntarily, into large -scale digitization 
exerc ises and databases. In some cases, such as India’s unique identification system 
Aadhaar , which is based on an individual’s biometric and demographic data, the ostensible 
aim is to improve access to public services and welfare schemes (Drèze et al 2017, Kri shna 
2019). Likewise, their exposure to video surveillance is justified in terms of greater safety 
and security (Rathi & Tandon 2019).  
 
In other cases, for which there is no solid body of evidence yet, these settlements, often in 
strategically located area s of the city with rising property values, become coveted objects of 
spatial mapping on the part of government planners, private property developers and land 
mafias. Our study is a first attempt to assess how local communities perceive their 
engagement in these different types of exercises in terms of risks and benefits. We show 
how knowledge/data about a community’s physical occupation of space articulates with 
justice and rights in a local context. We argue that the residents’ lack of occupation rights in  
conjunction with their lack of reliable information greatly intensifies their sense of insecurity 
and powerlessness. As Johnson (2014) and others have noted, land records digitization, 
upon which officially recognized land rights are based, is accompanied  by significant hazards 
for people without secure tenure.  
 
The context for this analysis is the western Hyderabad landscape also known as Cyberabad, 
a fast -transforming economic frontier for digital technologies. Expected to reach 10 million 
residents in the next decade, Hyderabad is one of India’s IT services boomtowns. The city’s 
development into an IT services powerhouse has been led by state government initiatives 
since the 1990s when the Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu promoted the iconi c HITEC 
City17 enclave on the western periphery of the city to house IT and financial services majors. 
In the ensuing growth push, large tracts of land have been assigned to multinational and 
national IT -enabled services companies for campuses and Special Economic Zones. Existing 
farming and pastoral communities have found themselves pushed to the margins of these 
‘world -class landscapes’ as older livelihoods and ways of living have been rendered 
unviable. At the same time, newer populations of migrants fro m neighbouring states have 
arrived to participate both in high skill professional jobs and in low skill services activities 
such as construction work, housekeeping, driving and domestic help to service the IT 
economy.  
 
Against this backdrop, the questions raised by our case study about the relationship of new 
digital and data technologies to issues of distributive justice assume special piquancy. Our 
primary conceptual frame is one of ‘information politics’, i.e., the way information is used to 
wield power and to perpetuate information inequalities.  
 
Our case study offers a grounded empirical examination of these questions through the lens 
of community mapping exercises in low -income communities located at the fringes of the 
information technology -led econom y of western Hyderabad. Our major comparison is 
 
16 According to 2011 Census of India and Nation al Sample Survey  69th Round, 2012 , 65.49 million slum 
inhabitants live in 13.92 million  households . The slum population is 5.4% of the country’s total population and 
17.4% of the total urban population (MHUPC 2015).

 between an enumeration exercise conducted by our research team and a community survey 
conducted by the local anganwadi  or government -supported natal and childcare facility for 
the Integrated Child Development  Services (ICDS). The first exercise, carried out by our 
team, consists of a household enumeration of the basti, including geospatial coordinates of 
individual dwellings. This exercise ran into concerted hostility from some basti leaders, 
making it difficu lt to complete the enumeration. Although incomplete, it nonetheless 
offered considerable insight into the informational landscape of the basti. This contrasts 
with the second, more formalized data generation exercise carried out by the ICDS, which 
was digi tized for the first time this year via a smartphone app that included geotagging. 
Although the ICDS surveyors faced relatively little resistance in previous rounds, this year’s  
exercise did elicit some resistance, indicating the larger sentiment of mistrus t around digital 
technologies. Residents complained that both forms of data collection could expose them to 
eviction.  
 
Among the key questions we seek to answer: What are the main structural and contingent 
factors that shape information politics in local c ommunities? How are the broader 
information landscapes related to attitudes/perceptions about digitalization and about the 
risks and benefits of data collection exercises in particular ? Our analysis has a two -fold 
scalar focus: first, the locality of Gachi  Basti and the PHC as social units, with their internal 
divisions (based on political factions, class, gender, status as migrants or non -migrants). 
Second, we take into account the basti’s relationship to the outside, whether as 
marginalized ‘clients’ in l arger patronage networks, as low -income residents in an 
increasingly upscale area, or as citizens vis -à-vis state agencies . 
 
Our findings suggest an arena of stark informational disparities between these vulnerable, 
indigent populations and the increasingl y sophisticated digital data apparatuses used to 
encode them. Although the availability of digital audio -video technologies through cheap 
mobile networks among basti residents is rendering traditional hierarchies somewhat more 
volatile, it has not in any m eaningful way disrupted the regulation of information flows by 
socially, economically and politically powerful actors. As we argue, the democratizing 
potential of emerging digital technologies is severely constrained by structural inequities 
across gender,  caste, class, political and even linguistic lines. Therefore, data processes must 
take explicit cognizance of these disparities and fragmentation to ensure that data justice is 
realized. Our case study thus offers a cautionary note about ‘naïve’ data coll ection exercises 
that fail to recognize the internal structural differentiation of vulnerable communities. We 
argue for an explicit mapping of the information flows and associated information politics 
that characterize such settings.  
 
In the next section, we outline the conceptual framework we employ to understand these 
findings. The following section gives an account of the methods employed during data 
collection and comments on the research design developed for this study. In the section on 
findings, we p resent the observations from the various methods of data collection, focusing 
on three key themes - the effects of information politics in datafication, receptivity to 
upstream datafication processes, and the use of technology in everyday lives. The fifth 
section ties together the evidence collected and concludes by highlighting the implications 
for future research on data justice themes in cities of the global South.

 5B. Background  
 
While the emerging literature on data justice has largely relied on theor ies developed or 
conceived in the global North (Taylor 2017, Heeks & Renken 2018), a promising new strand 
of work evaluates how issues of data justice play out in the cities of the global South. Work 
in this vein has introduced a valuable element of empiri cal engagement with themes that 
animate wider urban governance modalities at the interface of the formal and the informal 
in these settings (Donovan 2012, Heeks & Shekhar 2019). Our case study, although located 
in a larger literature on datafication in inf ormal settlements in cities of the global South, 
nonetheless departs from it in several respects. Key to the contribution of our study is its 
setting on the peri -urban frontier of one of India’s premier IT hubs. First, it allows us an 
opportunity to assess  the existence of channels for the diffusion of digital technologies 
across physically adjacent spaces. Second, it represents an uncharted terrain as far as NGOs 
and CBOs are concerned. For the vast majority of existing studies (Lundine et al 2012, 
Shekhar  2012, Panek & Sobotova 2015, Hagen 2017 and others cited in Heeks & Shekhar 
2019 as well as in Patel & Baptist 2012), reliance on a variety of such intermediaries and/or 
leaders tends to obscure internal differentiation within the ‘community’.  
 
Our case s tudy thus opens up the black box of the community to reveal the internal fissures 
and fragmentation that mark the information landscape in settings without active civil 
society intervention, the default in most peri -urban sites. Given the unique features o f our 
case, our approach has been inductive. The aim has not been primarily to test hypotheses 
suggested by the data justice literature but to understand and derive a picture of 
information flows within and beyond the communities under study . As indicated,  our 
variable of interest is not simply data, but the larger landscape of information.  
 
Figure 1 maps out the internal divisions that mark our sites and the potential interfaces with 
the outside world. These interfaces also represent possible opportunities  for information 
outflow.

Our setting thus leads us to adopt a critical approach, recognizing that structural conditions, 
including institutions that embody those conditions, shape both the distribution of data 
resources and the patterns of benefits that derive from them (Johnson 2014, Heeks 2017, 
Heeks & Renken 2018). This approach involves examining how social, political and 
institutional structures condition acce ss to information as well as services and/or resources. 
Our focus on how conflicting interests underpin the generation and sharing of 
data/information and on how issues of access to data/information intersect with larger 
power relationships underlines the political economy of information in this setting.  
 
Nonetheless, our analysis allows for individual agency within the broader structural 
approach. Our case will contribute to a reflection on how to expand on a structural 
framework to encompass the empirical  realities of the field. We draw on Heeks and Renken 
(2018) to examine various dimensions of data justice. Our conceptual frame for 
understanding the role of structural factors is the idea of information politics.  
 
Although instrumental concerns have been shown to shape data processes in this type of 
setting (Heeks & Renken 2018), our analysis suggests the need to qualify this understanding 
in specific contexts. For example, from the perspective of the residents, “downstream”18 
processes of execution would appear to matter significantly. As our interviewees repeatedly 
told us, they believe that previous attempts by government agencies to collect data led to 
disastrous consequences in terms of demolition and eviction. Thus, our findings would 
suggest that an instrumental perspective should apply both to risks and rewards that accrue 
from information sharing.  
 
However, in fact, the ostensible salience of instrumental concerns is mediated by issues of 
distributive justice and undercut by the real structural imba lances in access to data and 
information across the state agencies and the residents. This is because the distribution of 
rewards from information exchange depends critically on the individual’s location within the 
landscape of information politics. As man y of our Dalit19 and female respondents reminded 
us, they were the ones to bear the brunt of the risks of sharing information with outsiders. 
In contrast, basti leaders were often able to capitalize their strategic position within 
community information flo ws to consolidate the rewards they accrued for transmitting 
information to elected representatives at various levels. Thus, structural data injustices both 
configured and were reconfigured by the broader information politics of this setting.  
 
  
 
18 “Downstream” here refers to later activities in the “information value chain” (Heeks & Shekhar 2019): the 
use of processed data in the form of information, for decisions and actions about or by basti residents. 
“Upstream” refers to earlier activities: the  gathering, processing and visualization of data about low -income 
settlements.

discrimination because of their position at the bottom of the ritual hiera rchy under Brahmanical Hinduism.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88

 5B1. Occupancy as a structural factor  
 
The vast majority of the basti inhabitants have no legal rights but only a tenuous form of 
occupancy rights over the place they live.20 Yet their continuous occupation over several 
decades has given them a sense of entitle ment to this place; their settlement long preceded 
the arrival of Cyberabad and the high -rise gated communities.  
 
In particular, the issue of illegality is central to an understanding of this case and its 
theoretical significance. The lack of a legally san ctioned presence in this place leaves its 
residents at the mercy of distant bureaucrats, elected officials and members of the 
community with ambitions . At the same time that residents are distrustful of becoming part 
of a database, they are desperate to es tablish their right to stay. To do so, they call upon a 
collective shared history, which is often implicit, community -based knowledge to 
corroborate their claims and position themselves in relation to more recent arrivals. 
Likewise, they make paper claims (formal, bureaucratic knowledge) such as electricity or 
water bills as proof of residency (see also Ranganathan 2013). Several respondents whose 
houses were demolished believe those latter forms of proof should have provided 
protection. Many told us, “we b uilt our homes and nobody said anything”.21 In other words, 
a lack of punitive action on the part of the state was interpreted as consent. Far from 
irrational, this is emblematic of the way the urban poor navigate in their ‘negotiated’, never 
fully secured , right to the city (Benjamin & Raman 2001, Zérah et al 2011).  
 
This case underscores the necessity to recognize how seemingly antagonistic regimes co -
exist simultaneously: for instance, one based on private property rights and one based on 
occupation righ ts. Occupation rights are de facto recognized in India in specific settings at 
specific points in time (Benjamin 2008), although they must be constantly renegotiated. A 
key question is whether data -intensive development practices can co -exist with the info rmal 
‘management’ of populations by the state (Chatterjee 2004, Roy 2009), based on the 
implicit recognition of the rights of vulnerable communities to the commons (property or 
resources). Thus, our notion of information politics resonates with structural approaches to 
data justice.  
 
5B2. A frontier setting?  
 
Our study can contribute to wider debates on data/information justice. In many respects, it 
is an extreme case, focused on people with multiple vulnerabilities: social (illiterate, low 
caste), legal (without legal tenure, squatters) and spatial (located at the urban frontier, in 
the interstices of rapidly transforming high -value land). Yet although extreme, it is not 
marginal in the sense that it is emblematic of many situations in India, involv ing millions of 
citizens. Two important features of our setting particularly deserve notice.

 First, unlike several of the case studies discussed in Heeks and Shekhar (2019), Gachi Basti is 
a frontier setting which has seen little intervention by community -based organizations or 
civil society groups. As a result, residents have little experience with instrumentally ‘fair’ 
data processes mediated by such groups.  
 
Second and equally important, the information landscape of the basti is highly fractured on 
lines of caste, ethnicity, language, gender. The basti leaders occupy important nodes of 
power, largely by proxy, by virtue of their links to politicians. These include, but are not 
limited to, the elected corporator of Greater Hyderabad municipality and the l ocal Member 
of Legislative Assembly (MLA). As we document below, this differential access to 
information by different groups within the basti and the tight regulation of information to 
and from the basti by the leaders have serious consequences for shaping  the information 
inhabitants have about their entitlements.  
 
In other words, the achievement of procedural, instrumental or distributive data justice22 is 
fundamentally determined not only by the larger structures of power in terms of state -
citizen relatio nships, which have received attention in the existing literature (Heeks & 
Renken 2018), but also by the power asymmetries at the micro -level of the basti. The slum’s 
dominant social structures affect data processes, as well as their outcomes. This is the 
essence of our focus on information politics. As we document in our findings below, the 
choices available to individuals and their capability to exercise control over their lives are 
enabled and constrained by broader social structures.  
 
 
5C. Methods  
 
As in dicated above, our field site comprises Gachi Basti, a locality classified as a slum as per 
municipal surveys in Greater Hyderabad, and its neighbouring PHC blocks. The background 
and rationale for our choice of the site come from the housing vulnerability  that shapes the 
experience of communities such as these. In August 2018, authorities demolished 56 houses 
in Gachi Basti in an early morning raid, leaving the residents deeply shaken and rendering 
numerous families homeless. These families were allotted h ousing in the PHC at the other 
end of the basti. Shortly before that, in April 2018, some 200 families were also shifted to 
the PHC from another demolition site, nearly 10 kilometres away. Those families had lost 
their houses to a slum -wide demolition driv e that occurred after a fire accident. Before 
developing our research methods in more detail, a brief description of the field site provides 
important context.  
 
Gradually built -up through self -construction starting in the 1980s, the core community of 
Gachi  Basti belongs to a so -called “backward” caste and members of this group worked until 
recently as stone crushers in the nearby quarries. They migrated over time from northern 
Telangana (the Indian state of which Hyderabad is the capital) and the border are a with the 
 
22 These are three dimensions of data justice (alongside rights -based and structural): procedural refers to 
“fairness in the way in which data is handled”; instrumental to “ fairness in the results of data being used ”; and 
distributive to “the (in)equality of data -related outcomes ” (Heeks & Shekhar 2019:995). For further details, 
readers are referred to Heeks and Shekhar (2019).  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88

 neighbouring state of Karnataka. Telugu is the native language spoken by the majority of the 
population. Some of the families who once spoke Kannada (native to Karnataka), adopted 
Telugu as their first spoken language. The area started rapidly t ransforming from the late 
2000s. The privately -operated quarries were shut down in 2009 and the land became 
increasingly occupied by the rapidly expanding IT cluster, which is characterized by large -
scale housing compounds and office complexes that accommo date globally -connected firms 
employing highly educated professionals. Some people from the local communities found 
jobs in the cluster in “housekeeping” (cleaning and maintenance), security services, etc., 
although many lack the minimum qualifications and  skills required.  
 
Since a large proportion of the residents of Gachi Basti belongs to a single caste, there is a 
sense of connection among people, even when they are not directly related. However, our 
investigation also indicates deep internal divisions, although the nature of the fracture lines 
- political, ideological, class or ethnicity - is not entirely clear. Basti leaders, all men, are 
aligned to more powerful politicians or movements and individuals appear to be loosely 
affiliated to one or the othe r faction, although there is fluidity and overlap. In addition to 
the more established third -generation residents, our incomplete enumeration exercise 
revealed a significant number of non -Telugu -speaking migrants, from outside Telangana, 
renting accommodat ion in the basti. They are engaged in largely unskilled service activities 
such as construction work, housekeeping, driving and domestic help.  
 
The approach to empirical research adopted for this study was case study strategy, based on 
mixed qualitative an d quantitative research methods. These included observation during 
frequent visits to the locality, interviews with key informants, and focus group discussions 
with residents. Within the community, our informants included basti leaders, a leader of a 
women ’s self -help group as well as government functionaries such as anganwadi workers, 
water board employees or education inspectors. Informants outside the community 
included elected officials and municipal officers . In addition to questions on information 
flows, we investigated the impacts of new technologies, smartphones and various 
datafication processes, with the aim to assess how increased access to digital data is shaping 
social dynamics in the slum, such as access to employment, information about governm ent 
schemes and knowledge about rights (to public services and property).  Although not initially 
a focus of our research design, the PHC on the edge of the basti took on significance in light 
of the fact that evicted residents of Gachi Basti were resettled  there.  
 
5C1. Enumeration exercise  
 
We initially planned an enumeration exercise in order to allow us to develop a stratified 
sample survey of residents who could be further interviewed individually. In our interviews 
with leaders of the basti and the focus group session with the residents at the PHC blocks, 
we discussed our upcoming fieldwork at the basti. The leaders and other residents were 
open to sharing information about Gachi Basti and offered to introduce us to other 
residents.23

 After obtainin g consent from residents, we used smartphones to collect data about their 
family size and house, geo -tagging each residence (Table 1). Despite giving consent, it soon 
became clear that many residents had doubts about the aims of our study.  
 
Members of our team were asked about the intentions and end -use of our data collection. 
The digital mapping through GPS, in particular, was seen as risky. As we were employing, in 
parallel, a numbering system on printed Google Maps, residents expressed worry about the 
need for a geographical survey. As the news/misinformation spread in the basti about our 
enumeration exercise, households refused to share data unless the basti leaders intervened. 
Hostility to the enumeration process was ostensibly demonstrated most vocally  and 
persistently from one basti leader, who instructed residents not to cooperate with us. This 
man insisted that we stop visiting the basti and threatened our collaborators with physical 
harm if we continued.24 Although several of the leaders were indivi dually open to our 
presence and survey, their multiple political affiliations had fragmented into discrete 
spheres of influence, making it difficult to bring them to common ground.  
 
As we sought to understand the apprehensions of the residents, we learned that a similar 
exercise had been linked in the residents’ minds with the eviction drive conducted by the 
Mandal Revenue Office (MRO).25 As one resident put it,  
Even before the eviction, people like you came in to the basti and took our 
information posing a s government servants and bank officers. Then the result of it 
was the eviction as you see it. Now we feel afraid to share information with 
anyone.26 
 
As this suggests, and as we elaborate below, what people believe happened in previous data 
collection pro cesses, and its link to eviction, colours their views on subsequent exercises. 
The findings from the partially completed enumeration are presented in Table 1.27

Note: We recorded a unit of household based on the Census of India definition, i.e., a group of individuals 
living together and sharing a common kitchen. In the second column, we were able to collect only 125 
responses; in the absence of legal rights over the land on which they have constructed their houses, many 
families were not willing to reveal to us whether they lease out a part of their house to others.  
 
It is worth noting that the survey was conducted in almost half of Gachi Basti. Among the 
househol ds surveyed, 74% (134 households) were one -room structures. We observed that 
as the survey approached the part of the basti where the eviction had taken place,

 resistance from residents to our enumeration became more pronounced. People brought up 
the recen t eviction drive as a lesson to avoid sharing information with ‘outsiders’.  
 
In addition, we also spoke to the families who were recently evicted from the basti and 
placed in the PHC in two focus group discussions. This access has given us important insigh ts 
into the politics of information, and data justice more broadly. It is interesting to note that 
the respondents were more open to sharing opinions and information in open -ended 
interviews. One woman even commented,  
... people like you [researchers] shou ld come to the basti and observe our living 
conditions. But today we do not know who represents what or who to believe; we 
are scared because we have been betrayed.28

 5C2. Comparing with the ICDS survey  
 
The anganwadi survey conducted by the state government’s ICDS was used as a 
comparative benchmark for our team’s enumeration. In its prior iterations, the anganwadi 
survey was conducted  on paper to calculate the population and family sizes in the basti. The 
survey recorded data based on the Aadhaar identity number of residents to provide pre -
natal and post -natal services to pregnant women and their children (see, for example, Table 
3). T he data was recorded on registers to keep track of the population in order to deliver 
adequate services.

Note: Unlike the household definition used in our enumeration exercise (see Note, Table 1), the anganwadi data considers 
families related to each other, and living next to each other, as a single household. The anganwadi survey en countered 
technical problems in recording data in the PHC, hence the above data does not cover most residents in the PHC.  
 
The anganwadi digitized the survey for 2019 using an app developed by the ICDS. The 
digitized survey records data about the family me mbers along with the geographical 
coordinates (geotagging) of each household. We interviewed the anganwadi surveyors while 
the digitized survey was ongoing, to understand the reception of the basti residents to the 
new survey method. The surveyors reported  that some residents who had recently moved 
into the basti expressed fear over the use of digital technology and hence, refused to share 
their data. These specific families were afraid that digitally recording their presence in the 
basti would make them mo re vulnerable to eviction. The surveyors were reminded of the 
eviction that took place last year and were told by those families that recording such data 
posed a threat to their homes.29

 5D. Findings  
 
Our case study analysis yielded three main findings corresponding to our research questions 
outlined at the outset. First, issues of data justice are embedded in informational politics 
i.e., the ways in which informational resources, as well as the risks a nd rewards associated 
with them, are distributed across individual actors and identity groups. This information 
landscape is shaped by structural factors. Secondly, instrumental concerns shape data 
processes in this setting to a degree, and in some context s, downstream processes appear 
to matter. However, the internal disparities in the community mean that structural factors 
dominate more than instrumental concerns. Third, residents in the basti have differential 
access, capabilities and attitudes to digita l technology. These  findings are further developed 
below.  
 
5D1. Datafication processes are influenced by wider structures of power, 
which mediate information politics  
 
We argue that issues of data justice are embedded in informational politics, i.e., the w ays in 
which informational resources, as well as the risks and rewards associated with them, are 
distributed across individual actors and identity groups. Widespread illiteracy and 
innumeracy are underlying contextual factors that inhibit growing dataficat ion from having 
a ‘liberating’ effect in the form of access to independent sources of information. The social 
hierarchy of the community is also a major impediment to the free flow of information, and 
the community’s internal power structure, therefore, be comes crucial to the analysis.  
 
As Figure 2 shows, basti leaders centralize information flows. This convergence is facilitated 
by the fact that the slum is fragmented in terms of caste, language, gender, ethnicity and 
political affiliations. This also lead s to informational disparities among various groups with 
implications for their participation in political processes. In addition, the gatekeepers of the 
slum exercise tight control over the information value chain, by controlling both the inflow 
and outfl ow of information (see Figure 3).

 In terms of social structure, it is significant that neither of these settings (Gachi Basti or PHC) 
has active formal CBOs or non -partisan NGOs. While the resettled families in the PHC are 
supported by a church headed by a local pastor, the Hindu nationalist organization, th e 
Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), has an active presence in Gachi Basti. The overtly 
political agenda of the RSS, articulated through the electoral politics of the ascendant 
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), lends a strong ‘political society’ orientation to  collective action 
in the community (Chatterjee 2004).  
 
Party politics is a significant mode through which community grievances and demands find 
expression. The major political parties install local ‘leaders’ who play a key role in 
transmitting information  from elected party officials higher up in the chain and in turn 
communicating community issues to elected representatives. For example, immediately 
following the demolition at the basti, local BJP cadres organized vehicles to bring people to 
the administr ative office and led the protest. The protesters were taken into police custody 
and court cases were initiated against them. Several of the women who had been arrested 
admitted to being completely unaware of the grounds of their conviction or the litigatio n 
process.  
 
In our focus group discussions, respondents reported that only leaders remained in contact 
with municipal officials and elected representatives. This forced community reliance on the 
leaders for all issues pertaining the basti, including housin g and development work. One of 
the women who lost her house in the eviction drive and got arrested in a subsequent clash 
with the police remarked about the leaders:  
[T]hey are all hungry for power. I went to their doors over ten times after my release 
to ask about our home, but none of them helped me. (…). These leaders even 
mediate our talks with the MLA and do not allow us to question him directly. Our 
family has been living here for three generations now, but we still do not have a 
place in our own basti .30 
 
The evictees from the basti at the PHC said that when they tried to meet the elected 
representatives on their own, they were turned away and told to “behave themselves” and 
communicate through their leaders.31 
 
The people in the PHC have little idea about what the government has planned for their 
future accommodation; they were promised individual apartments by their political 
representatives, but there has been little further news about that. Almost without 
exce ption, respondents lacked certainty about the title deeds or patta  on the land they 
occupied. Some claimed they possessed patta, but that the municipality is holding their legal 
documents as a form of collateral. These claims could not be cross -checked.  
 
If information is power, the political profoundly shapes information flows in these settings. 
Thus, the politics of information become salient and even central both to spatial resource 
and data justice agendas. However, collective action is made difficult b y the sheer 
fragmentation of the terrain. Thus, although they live adjacent to each other and share

 common issues, the people belonging to the main caste group of Gachi Basti do not speak to 
the Dalit evictees from the fire who live in the PHC. Similarly, although they occupy the 
same physical space, language barriers divide the migrant renters from outside the state 
from local Telugu -speaking communities.  
 
These constraints further reinforce the politics of information. Information transmission for 
vulnerable groups, in particular, women, the evicted, and Dalits, carries considerable risks. 
In both our field sites, our interactions with local community actors were often subject to 
approval and redirection by the ‘leaders’ and occasionally self -appoin ted gatekeepers who 
attempted to determine the topics of discussion.  
 
To summarize, the internal structure of power in the slum is a crucial dimension of the 
analysis. We found that the slum was fragmented in terms of caste, language, gender, 
ethnicity and  political affiliations. This leads to informational disparities among various 
groups along with implications for their participation in politicized informational processes 
(see Figure 4).  
 
Figure 4: Information Intermediation in the Community  
 
 
5D2. The assessment of downstream effects shapes receptivity to upstream 
activities, but only to a degree  
 
Our information politics framework pays careful attention to distributive issues of the risks 
and rewards of information flows. Instrumental concerns, i.e., t he perspective of gaining 
benefits downstream, do appear to shape data processes in this setting. However, this 
needs to be qualified as expectations about outcomes can lead to cooperation or resistance 
depending on whether they are perceived positively (b enefits) or negatively (risks). Previous 
experiences certainly condition whether residents will cooperate or resist attempts at data 
collection. If residents were reluctant or refused to participate in our enumeration exercise, 
it is probably because there  were no tangible benefits they could anticipate.  
 
Moreover, as we explained above, in the sheer informational miasma that characterized 
residents’ understanding of the outcome of the data they had shared with government Leaders 'External' facingLeader 1 Leader 2Women

Migrants'Outside'

 agencies, many were convinced it ha d led to their eviction. This explained heightened 
anxiety and resistance from them to further attempts at datafication, both our enumeration 
and the digitalized ICDS survey. However, not only is the receptivity to the ICDS survey 
hardening somewhat in the  aftermath of the demolition, it is worth noting that there may 
be some grounds to the widespread perception that the pre -demolition survey was 
intended to support the eviction. There is considerable evidence available, both from our 
interviews with reside nts, as well as the spatial characteristics of the demolition site that the 
authorities had spatial information on the basti.32 We were not able to confirm this in our 
interviews with officials because of the politically sensitive nature of the eviction. M oreover, 
the responsible officers in the MRO that were directly involved with the demolition were 
transferred in the weeks following the incident and were hence not available.33 More 
importantly, the local Member of the Legislative Assembly, the most impor tant elected 
representative at the state level explicitly linked the demolition to the spread of 
‘encroachment’ on land designated for a housing scheme by the central government.34 
 
In an interesting contrast, we observe there is greater openness to sharin g information 
when residents perceive tangible benefits. The water board and the electricity board have 
information about the basti (names, house number, location, phone number), which the 
residents shared in order to receive services.35 The anganwadi surv ey generally met with 
little resistance due to the physical presence of the anganwadi centre in the basti for the 
past seven years, and the familiarity of the residents with the anganwadi facilitators 
(teacher, helper), unlike our own team of enumerators.  
 
Corroborating findings from other studies (e.g. Heeks & Shekhar 2019), we observed an 
ambivalence between the desire to remain invisible and the desire to be recognized as 
legitimate citizens, with occupancy rights. For instance, renting rooms to migrants  is an 
important source of livelihood for the basti residents, which they want to hide from the 
authorities. Their current anxiety, exacerbated by the recent demolition and eviction, has 
made them wary and suspicious of data collection exercises.

had claimed was encroached or illegally occupied prior to the eviction.

 5D3. Digital audio -video technologies are increasingly available in the basti, 
but they have not disrupted the regulation of information flows by powerful 
actors  
 
Regarding the role of digital technology in the basti, our field investigations examined 
expos ure to digitalization at various scales, starting with access to the internet. We collected 
data on the types of information people access through technology. We found that people 
in the basti have differential access, capabilities and attitudes to digital  technology.  
 
Out of the 181 households covered by our incomplete enumeration exercise, 171 or 94.5% 
owned at least one mobile phone. Of these 171, 67 households (37%) owned one mobile 
phone each, while 72 households (40%) owned two and 32 (18%) of those s urveyed 
possessed more than two mobile phones .36 
 
The use of technology is deeply gendered. In most instances, the man of the household 
owned a mobile phone which was shared by his spouse. Several respondents (men and 
women) said that women are not educated enough to handle mobile phones, or that 
women do not need mobile phones because they would stay at home most of the time.37 
The idea of women’s safety was also invoked to discourage women from using digital 
technology. It was claimed that the use of smartphones by women and their presence on 
social media can attract unwarranted male attention in the form of stalking.38 
 
Digital technology puts the inhabitants of the basti into big data systems like Aadhaar, 
Google Maps or open data sources like You Tube. YouTube videos played important roles in 
our interaction with the basti and PHC inhabitants. Videos of both the Gachi Basti eviction 
and the fire that brought evacuees from further afield to the PHC are available on YouTube. 
Several respondents showe d us such videos of the demolition and the fire respectively to 
substantiate their claims. While talking to people outside the basti about their precarity, 
they use the videos as evidence to testify the claims they make.  
 
We did not find evidence that digi tal technology is being used for accessing information 
pertaining to employment opportunities or government schemes. One exception was 
security personnel working for a global firm staying in the basti, who claimed to have a 
WhatsApp group with colleagues w here they share work -related information. Migrant 
workers, residing in the basti, working in housekeeping or security services in the 
surrounding IT hub used mobile phones to keep in touch with their families, irrespective of 
 
36 We did not record data on smartphone (as opposed to basic mobile phone)  possession because of  concerns  
resident s expressed before the beginning of the survey. As o ne respondent said, “I bought this [showing his 
smartphone] with my hard -earned money . You ca nnot question what I have.”  Recorded during our 
enumeration survey on 3 March 2019.  
37 Respondents expressed such opinions during interviews and focus group discussions at the PHC when 
questioned about their use of mobile phones.

 gender.39 While smartphones se emed to be primarily used for entertainment purposes and 
local news, inhabitants of the PHC had a WhatsApp group.  
 
Under such circumstances, does differential access to technology -enabled information 
create new divisions among the residents of the slum? Ra ther than subverting the existing 
power structures in the basti, e.g., by easing access to various types of information among 
the residents, digital technologies may, on the contrary, strengthen them. Basti leaders may 
use technology as a means of increasi ng their control over the inhabitants. An example is 
the RSS youth leader circulating images of our team through WhatsApp to the people in the 
slum so that they would not share any information with us. Similarly, we found that elected 
representatives and o ther politicians used digital means such as WhatsApp to exclusively 
communicate with the leaders, rather than the community at large.40 
 
At the same time, being part of the Aadhaar digital database has become central to gain 
access to all kinds of government services like admission to a school, water supply, bank 
accounts, etc. It is symptomatic that some families in the PHC have pasted their Aadhaar 
cards on their doors. In response to our questions, we were told it is to establish proof of 
their i dentity so that no one can question their stay in the PHC.41 It is noteworthy that 
people working as domestic servants at the gated communities in the neighbourhood have 
to present their Aadhaar card each time they enter their workplace.  
 
In summary, while  making these communities more visible to state apparatuses, there is 
little evidence that digital technologies have empowered them in meaningful ways or 
subverted the internal power structures in the community.

 5E. Discussion and Conclusions  
 
Followin g from, but also nuancing Heeks and Renken (2018), our findings highlight the 
centrality of structural issues in shaping the relevance of other approaches to data justice. 
As Figure 5 shows, this is a key component of the information politics framework tha t we 
propose. The internal power dynamics as well as the relationship of the basti with the larger 
institutions of power – i.e., information politics - determine the data -information -decision -
action processes (who knows what and to what ends). It condition s the procedural, 
distributive, institutional and rights -based dimensions leading to information justice.  
 
Figure 5: Information Politics - Instrumental, Distributive and Procedural Approaches to 
Data Justice are Mediated by Structural Dimensions  
   
 
In terms of information justice, we share the concern that datafication processes and open 
data policies that render such communities more visible can exacerbate injustice, with 
potentially high costs for vulnerable groups (Raman & Denis 2013, Johnson 2014). Once 
basti residents are counted and form part of a system of information, they may become 
more vulnerable. With evicti on a very real threat, remaining invisible is often perceived as 
the best form of protection. As Heeks and Renken (2018) remind us, there is also a “right to 
be forgotten”. In this context, we advocate a pragmatic as opposed to a normative stance 
with rega rd to promoting data collection activities, one that takes account of specific 
settings (cf. Recommendations below).  
 
This takes on particular importance in light of the fact that the quest for invisibility is 
undermined by the structural nature of information and/or data justice. As Taylor argues, 
“the greatest burden of dataveillance (surveillance using digital methods)  has always been 
borne by the poor” (2017: 2). We have noted the presence of surveillance cameras in the 
basti, near the PHC. This engenders the “ambivalence of legibility”, noted by Heeks and Information justice      Resource justiceInstrumental

 Shekhar (2019:1006) -- marginalized populations want to stay hi dden to avoid eviction and 
yet simultaneously want to be visible in order to access security, resources and services.  
 
Despite the absence of formal property rights, we have observed a thriving informal rent 
economy. Residents lease out a room or two in th eir house to others, often migrants from 
other states. This rental income is a critical source of livelihood for these families, many of 
whom earn subsistence -level wages. There was a strong reluctance to reveal this rental 
economy to the gaze not only of the state but also to the putatively neutral gaze of the 
researcher. In fact, the most vociferous opponent of our enumeration admitted his 
suspicion that we would report his numerous rental premises. This somewhat more 
strategic, rather than survival, moti ve for the ambivalence of legibility may serve to nuance 
Heeks and Shekhar’s (2019) analysis.  
 
By drawing attention to the structural dimensions of data justice, our study contributes to a 
critique of mainstream views of data justice. Going beyond “justice  as a set of theoretical 
principles” to “justice -in-practice” (Heeks & Renken 2018:96), our case study speaks directly 
to the issues raised by these authors:  
Why is access to data maldistributed in the global South? Why is participation in data 
processes u nequally distributed? Why do the benefits of data systems in developing 
countries include some and exclude others?  
 
We argue that broader forms of resource and distributive injustice also limit the scope for 
the creation of new datasets about slum communit ies, with potential implications for 
improving assets, as Heeks and Shekhar (2019) suggest. In our comparative assessment of 
data collection, we find that the promise of downstream impacts shapes receptivity to 
upstream activities to a degree but that inst rumental or procedural justice approaches only 
go so far in allaying legitimate concerns and pervasive distrust of data collection in the 
presence of significant structural injustices. This is because information processes for such 
vulnerable populations c arry material risks and are subject to significant regulation by 
sometimes self -styled leaders.  
 
Our findings have ethical and methodological implications both for state and non -state data 
collection processes, including for researchers in such settings . Dealing with non -literate 
communities in a setting where structural factors shape or hinder the realization of data 
justice requires special precautions. It cannot be assumed that such communities will have 
the capabilities needed to assess the fallout of d ata processes. Deep mistrust, especially 
where previous state -condoned violence has taken place, is to be expected. Engaging 
community organizations or resource providers, where they exist, rather than relying on 
traditional leaders, may help bypass the mo re intractable aspects of information politics.  
 
Our findings suggest some concrete repercussions for community mapping and data 
collection exercises, outlined below.  
 
  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
132 
 5E1. Recommendations  
 
● Before undertaking upstream data collection activities, data col lectors must map out 
risks and rewards for different interest groups, remaining cognizant of the ways the 
information landscape is splintered by caste, class, language and gender lines. In other 
words, understanding the interplay of information politics wi thin the community is a key 
first step, especially in the absence of civil society gatekeepers/facilitators or CBOs.  
● Qualitative approaches that allow for open -ended ‘listening’ are received better by 
vulnerable groups compared to quantitative surveys or m ore structured approaches that 
can often be perceived as ‘extractive’. In our experience, spatialized data collection and 
spatial mapping, in particular, can be perceived as threatening and may lead to 
resistance from residents.  
● State -led data collection w ith clearly identified downstream impact linkages such as 
surveys conducted by the ICDS may represent an exception to this resistance. It is still 
early to judge because most of these surveys were conducted before the eviction in 
August 2018. State -led sur veyors (like those of the Indian Census) have a more direct 
approach and they inform the residents of the benefits of the survey upfront.  
● More broadly, while demonstrating clear downstream linkages may be key to realizing 
the promise of the digital technol ogy revolution for vulnerable urban populations in the 
global South, we argue that instrumental or procedural concerns only partially address 
the deeper structural factors that mediate the politics of information in these settings. 
Recent resistance to the  digitized version of the ICDS survey highlights the ways in which 
mistrust is engendered by the way digital technologies are deployed in these settings. 
Digital data processes operate most often to make vulnerable populations visible, 
leaving them little scope to stake out claims to land or livelihood.  
 
5E2. Future directions  
 
The role of socially prominent gatekeepers in the context of intra -community differentiation 
has received considerable interest in the methodological literature on ethnography (for 
example, Srinivas 1980). Employing the lens of information politics, our conceptual 
framework offers an approach to broaden these concerns to understand how hierarchy and 
disparity within the black box of the community may play out in the context of the 
datafication of vulnerable communities. In this paper, we have focused our attention on the 
ramifications of such information politics on community mapping and data collection 
exercises. However, our larger contention remains that informatio n is a resource, access to 
which is regulated through structures of power within and outside vulnerable communities.  
 
In future work, we aim to explore the ways in which power mediates the relationship of 
information access to resource access by looking at  public services beyond occupational 
rights. In particular, access to water remains a deeply contested and potentially illuminating 
arena for the interplay of information/data processes with the right to the city (for the 
Indian context see Zérah et al 201 1). Can communities expand information and resource 
access by adapting to the digitization agenda of the state?  
 
In addition, while a large body of work has established the rise of spatial and institutional 
fragmentation in peri -urban settings, this case s tudy suggests intriguing clues about Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
133 
 emerging forms of informational fragmentation that follow and deepen socio -economic 
fissures in these spaces. Indeed, the salience of caste, language and gender disparities may 
also provide a link between informational and institutional fragmentation that underlie 
emerging forms of segregation in Indian cities. For example, the rise of gated communities 
consolidates both physical and informational barriers across caste -class divides. However, 
our study points to hitherto  little understood forms of informational division – for example 
between local communities and low -skilled migrants along lines of language. Tracing the 
contours of these merging informational landscapes remains an important agenda for future 
work.

 Case 6: Aadhaar -Led Identification and 
Datafication Among Informal Workers in 
South India  
A Data -Justice Perspective

Abstract  
 
Aadhaar – India’s national biometric digital identity programme through its unique 12 -digit 
number for every Indian resident – has been intricately linked to daily aspects of living in 
recent years. The programme aims to enable digital linkage to governmental and non -
governmental services and through that achieve digital financial inclusion of groups like 
unbanked informal workers into the mainstream economy. This paper focuses on the 
Aadhaar e xperiences of two groups of informal workers in an Indian urban setting – cab-
drivers and domestic workers. These informal workers access digital platforms like online 
recruitment portals and gig -economy apps which are aimed at employment of urban ‘blue 
collar’ workers, using Aadhaar as an identity for verification through its complex 
technological ecosystem.  
 
Based on this evidence base, the paper provides two contributions. First, it presents a novel 
theoretical lens of social justice by operationalising ‘abnormal justice’ in a way that is 
synergistic with elements of surveillance and datafication inherent to digital identification. 
This results in a framework of data justice, enabling analysis along cultural, economic and 
political dimensions. Second, usi ng this framework the paper deconstructs empirical 
evidence collected using semi -structured interviews and field observations. Ultimately it 
argues that while Aadhaar identity and the data -flow it enables has become critical in 
enabling digital participati on of informal workers, digital identity is intimately related to 
inequality experienced by urban marginalised groups in three ways: current use of digital 
identities reifies extant cultural inequalities experienced by marginalised workers; 
unprotected dat afication creates new economic inequalities that exploit new -found digital 
participation enabled by digital identities; and unfair barriers continue to exist for the 
marginalised under digital identity to voice ‘informed co nsent’ or to access redressal of  
security issues.

 6A. Introduction  
 
Strong identification systems, reliable databases, and the surveillant visibility of the citizen 
to the state have been presented as a prerequisite to build ‘a social contract between 
governments and citizens’ (Breckenr idge 2014, Diop 2017). An acknowledged issue of the 
socio -economically disadvantaged population is that they fall into under what Gilman & 
Green (2018) have called the ‘surveillance gap’ – the ‘systemic invisibility’ of certain classes 
within society. Base d on this, particularly in the global South, identification programmes are 
seen as a necessity to enable hitherto disadvantaged groups to participate in socio -
economic transactions (Koops et al. 2009, Bennett & Lyon 2013, Lyon 2013). Countries 
including In dia, Brazil, Ghana, Malaysia, Indonesia and China are in the active phase of 
implementing a digital identity infrastructure (Nanavati et al. 2002, Madanapalle 2017, 
Swearingen 2018).  
 
Born out of a similar justification, Aadhaar – India’s national biometri c and digital identity 
programme – works using iris scans and fingerprints. These biometrics are used as the 
means of bodily verification of the individual specifically to prevent duplication of the 
individual’s records across the national database of resi dents. This results in a random 12 -
digit digital unique identity number for the individual. Personal information like 
demographic data, address, mobile phone numbers and email addresses of citizens are 
linked to this Aadhaar number. This information is als o printed on paper documents for 
offline use, alongside the other option of using downloaded XML data -files and QR codes 
which encode personal information – shared using purpose -built mobile app or through USB 
thumb drives.  
 
This positions Aadhaar such tha t while biometric data itself is not shared beyond Aadhaar’s 
database, verification using Aadhaar enables sharing of personal information necessary to 
prove one’s identity. Alongside this, advanced technical capabilities of Aadhaar’s 
architecture espouse t he ‘big data’ paradigms of ‘openness’ to interoperability and 
‘scalability’ to achieve high volumes of data (Varma 2014), and using ‘application 
programming interfaces’ (APIs) that enable digital verification. Consequently, Aadhaar 
functions at the core of  a complex ecosystem where the digital identity verification is used 
by both governmental and commercial systems. Ultimately, the personal information shared 
via the paper document or XML data -file can be confirmed as being genuine using the 
Unique Identit y Authority of India (UIDAI) website directly or by software integration of 
governmental and commercial systems that consume the UIDAI API (Viswanathan 2019).  
 
Given such capabilities, Aadhaar and its linkages create a need to understand the impact of 
‘datafication’ and its relation to digital identity. Datafication, defined as the transformation 
of social actions or outcomes into data through online quantification (Mayer -Schoenberger 
& Cukier 2013, Van Dijck 2014), carries the impact of identification forw ard in relation to the 
data -driven context of use of Aadhaar as digital identity. This means that despite the state 
not collecting vast quantities of data directly with a motive of surveillance, a move towards 
datafication creates data -flows that cause soc ial impacts beyond the original intention for 
which data was collected (Nayar 2012). It is acknowledged that marginalised groups within 
India especially face a situation where their newly found digital participation makes them 
vulnerable to risks due to un ethical practices of data use (The Wire 2017). Even when the Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
138 
 state seeks to address such concerns, its benefits do not always apply to the disadvantaged 
population due to factors like data -literacy, absence of awareness, or lack of access to 
redressal (Abr aham et al. 2017, ET 2018a). This presents a knowledge gap of understanding 
issues like ethics, fairness and inequality – encapsulated as the meta -issue of justice, in 
relation to the use of complex surveillance ecosystem of digital identity on those who a re 
already marginalised and are seeking a means to participate in the wider society.  
 
The focus of this paper is in understanding the impact of datafication through the study of 
two aspects. First, this paper places the use of digital identity within its c omplex ecosystem 
of use and its consequent impact. Secondly, this paper contextualises the use of digital 
identity and its surveillance capability among the experiences of the marginalised 
population. To achieve this the paper studies the daily -life experi ences of informal workers 
in south India using the lens of social justice to understand how they navigate the effects of 
surveillant visibility and datafication. The research question that this paper ultimately 
answers can be presented as: What is the soci al justice impact of a digital identity and the 
datafication enabled by it?  
 
The paper is structured to first discuss the relevant literature from which a conceptual 
framework of data justice is identified. Following a brief description of the case study 
background and the research methods, the empirical findings from the analysis of the case 
are presented. Finally, the wider implications of the paper and its findings are discussed 
before concluding with its specific recommendations.  
 
 
6B. Literature  
 
This section will briefly introduce recent scholarship on datafication, and its relation to 
surveillance and social justice. Building further on this a conceptual framework is developed 
that is to be used for the analysis of the case study unde r focus.  
 
6B1. Identification and Datafication  
 
‘National identity’ systems developed under electronic governance utilise digital 
technologies to deliver an open and multi -purpose identification infrastructure and enabling 
linkages to other systems, adding  complexity to their social impacts (Whitley & Hosein 
2010). With the lack of data -protection frameworks in the global South (Arora 2016), there 
is a strong potential for data -led discrimination and breach of ethics in use of data where 
linkages of open su rveillant -capable identification systems enable data -flow between the 
state and private entities. This has been acknowledged as an area of concern in recent 
scholarship calling for critical understanding of datafication and its context (Boyd & 
Crawford 201 2, Gangadharan 2012, Lyon 2014, Van Dijck 2014, Zuboff 2015, Dalton et al. 
2016, Broeders et al. 2017, Roth & Luczak -Roesch 2018). Research by Taylor & Broeders 
(2015) has specifically called for a new ethical approach in understanding surveillant 
visibili ty and datafication specifically anchored in the global South.  
 Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
139 
 The growing corpus of work on ‘data justice’ – including by Johnson (2014), Dencik et al. 
(2016) and Heeks & Renken (2018) – brings together the varying strands of theorisation 
related to data fication and surveillance, using a critical and an ethical lens. Mainly – as both 
Johnson (2014) and Dencik et al. (2016) present outright (Heeks & Renken 2018 allude to it) 
– surveillance is centrally placed in theorising the ‘justice’ paradigm. Most rele vantly Taylor 
(2017) has extended this to include theorisation of ‘visibilities’ in relation to data justice. 
This can also be read in the empirical works of Gangadharan (2012), who suggests the need 
to invoke ‘social justice’ as a means to understand incl usive participation predicated on 
digital technology and the ‘complexity of what participation and incorporation into online 
worlds entail’. Echoing this, the section that follows conceptualises identification and 
datafication within surveillance theorisat ion. 
 
6B2. Surveillance and Recognition  
 
Surveillance has been conceptualised by David Lyon (2010) as being ‘liquid’ – terming it 
‘liquid surveillance’ – which in turn is rooted in readings of Zygmunt Bauman’s (2000, 2013, 
and also Bauman & Lyon, 2013) not ion of ‘liquid modernity’. Liquid surveillance presents an 
argument which helps conceptualise ‘identification’ within contemporary society as a means 
of individualisation and of seeking legitimate identity through digital technologies. These 
core ideas are  to be engaged within the experiences of the surveilled individuals. Presenting 
surveillance as a concept of visibilities as Lyon (2010) summarises:  
Liquid surveillance describes well today’s regimes of in ⁄ visibility and is characterized 
by data -flows, m utating surveillance agencies and the targeting and sorting of 
everyone. (Lyon 2010: 325)  
Surveillance is thus intricately connected to datafication enabled through technological 
artefacts like mobile phones, codes and passwords, digital identities and onl ine profiles, 
working together to enable participation within the network (Bauman & Lyon 2013).  
 
Under such a theorisation the social function of surveillance can be probed further as 
‘recognition’ (Taylor 1997, Brighenti 2010, Lyon 2016). Recognition here  is the means of 
establishing one’s identity and categorisation as a demonstration of one’s position within 
society. This notion of recognition has been co -opted by Bauman & Lyon (2013) (also see 
Bauman 2001, Lyon 2016) as the starting point of liquid surv eillance. Legitimate 
identification sought by disadvantaged groups to be seen, to belong and to be counted by 
the state through programmes of welfare, of financial inclusion, and even of citizenship is 
subsumed in such a theorisation. Brighenti (2010) pres ents this as the need for ‘individual 
recognition’ sought by the previously disadvantaged and undocumented individual to be 
‘seen’ by the state using regimes of identification including the use of identity cards, 
technological artefacts (like smart cards),  and digital artefacts (like biometrics or identity 
numbers). This relation between identity and recognition thus presented as a socio -political 
notion is intertwined with issues of inclusion and marginalisation (Taylor 1997, Lister 2004) 
and also of visib ilities and surveillance (Brighenti 2010, Boellstorff 2013, Lyon 2016). 
Further, the most relevant theorisation that uses ‘recognition’ as a core notion in relation to 
social justice is of ‘abnormal justice’ by Fraser (1998, 2000, 2009). The next section p resents 
this as a framework within which the need for legal identity is conceptualised as 
‘recognition’ and is a key dimension of justice alongside other contextual social factors.

 6B3. Abnormal Justice  
 
Bauman (2001) invoking Fraser (1998) argues that ‘r ecognition’ must be understood with its 
allied economic or distributive justice factors. Fraser (2000, 2009) presents the same 
argument to understand complex ideas of justice with underlying dimensions as ‘abnormal 
justice’. Here justice is achieved by equ itable participation in society or ‘parity of 
participation’ – which depends on achieving parity in specific intertwined dimensions of 
distributive justice and recognition, echoing Bauman (2001).  
 
Since economic subordination in a society in many cases can  cause cultural subordination 
and vice versa, Fraser (2000) deems that considering the social role of identity as the result 
of a freestanding ‘cultural’ component in society would miss the economic component of 
seeking fair ‘redistribution’ of resources – or ‘distributive’ justice. To further contextualise 
claims to justice, Fraser extended redistribution and recognition as dual dimensions of 
justice by adding a third dimension of ‘representation’ and positing further that we live in an 
era of ‘abnormal ju stice’ as opposed to normal justice. Here normal justice presupposes 
‘parity of participation’ according to normative ‘social arrangements that permit all to 
participate as peers in social life’ (Fraser 2008: 405). The parity establishes clear common 
under standing of the critical nodes of justice: the ‘what’, the ‘who’, and the ‘how’ justice 
can be achieved in a society. While studying participation of an already disadvantaged 
population within a society, this parity is not present and is sought. Under abno rmal justice 
the ‘what’ of the justice is then profoundly changed. It is not just the fair distribution of 
resources or recognition in society. Here the ‘what’ is a wider conceptualisation of that 
which needs to overcome three societal injustices (Fraser 2 009):  
• Misrecognition – injustice in the cultural domain of existence where respect or 
esteem is unequal due to embedded cultural hierarchies. Disparity here results in 
unequal social standing where some individuals or groups face barriers due to 
cultural markers such as gender or caste.  
• Maldistribution – injustice in the economic domain where the distribution of 
resources is unequal. Disparity in aspects like lower income, wealth, or other 
intrinsically -economic value markers define an economic st ructure of inequality 
between actors in society.  
• Misrepresentation – injustice in the political domain where rules of participation in 
politico -spatial society are unequal. Disparity here creates a political voice -lessness 
and unequal democratic and proced ural access to participation.  
 
Overcoming the ‘subordination’ across cultural recognition, economic redistribution and 
political representation dimensions, the core objective of justice, which is ‘parity’, would be 
achieved as per Fraser (2000, 2009). Thes e three dimensions as discussed below are 
presented as central to probing the impacts of digital identity and their social justice 
impacts.  
 
The first two dimensions of recognition and redistribution were proposed initially by Fraser 
(2000). Recognition sp ecifically zeroes in on the impetus to seek digitally enabled 
participation within society through surveillance artefacts (Bauman 2001, Lyon 2016), and 
can be read in a way that is coherent with Fraser’s (2000) argument. Here the provision of 
an individual  identity helps overcome extant cultural subordination and attain social Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
141 
 ‘recognition’ (Brighenti 2010, Lyon 2016a). This understanding of identity and its role in 
recognition is synergistic with the role of surveillance as understood by Bauman & Lyon 
(201 3) and Brighenti (2010) (also see Lyon 2016). But, as noted above from Fraser’s (2000) 
work, economic subordination in a society can cause cultural subordination and vice versa. 
This is presented as the inevitable entwinement of the cultural and economic m ode of 
participation, that is of recognition and redistribution – the first two dimensions of parity in 
‘abnormal justice’ theorisation.  
 
This entwinement of recognition and redistribution has been acknowledged by other 
authors. For instance, in relation t o surveillance, Cinnamon (2017) argues that economic 
value varies due to the differing status hierarchy or ‘data -class’ (Manovich 2012, Andrejevic 
2014) one occupies in a data -driven society. The lower class that produces data relinquishes 
control of perso nal data and faces status inequality where direct economic value is derived 
from their data by higher classes in the status hierarchy – those who can collect and analyse, 
making data extractable for its economic value. Taking a cue from this, the dimension s of 
recognition and redistribution can be employed to understand status subordination leading 
to and resulting from use of digital identity , and possible inequalities in cultural and 
economic domain formed due to impacts of identification and consequent datafication.  
 
The third dimension seeks out fair political representation and equal voice in processes that 
define rules and make decisions within society. Injustice is the lack of political ‘voice’ in 
being able to participate in determination of the rul es of the society that individuals 
ultimately live under. Fairness in procedural aspects, especially in relation to data, falls 
under this dimension, particularly relating to those which determine control of an 
individual’s data. For instance, the tenet of  ‘information disclosure’ has been considered the 
means to provide ‘voice’ to users to be heard by decision makers (Bier 1993). In the more 
recent datafied condition a ‘fair’ means of giving voice and control of one’s data has been 
presented in relation to  procedures of ‘informed consent’ and options for ‘opt -in’ or ‘opt -
out’ (Ashworth & Free 2006, Fuchs 2011).  
 
These three dimensions of participatory parity operate within the same politico -spatial 
‘frame’, which is to say a typification of a societal setti ng not necessarily limited by 
geographical boundaries. The frame then defines the rules and in turn the boundary 
conditions of being accepted for participation, including in relation to a non -state or 
international entity. Any injustice in defining the bou ndary can exclude individuals from 
participation itself. In case of non -state participation like online services this can be 
understood as being defined by the ‘terms and conditions’ agreed. As the terms are dictated 
outside a ‘normal’ framework of justice  there is potential for the frame to be set on 
‘exploitative terms of interaction [ which ] then exempt [ service providers ] from democratic 
control’ (Fraser 2010). This complex political nature of justice particularly lends itself to 
study of surveillance an d datafication run through private, non -state actors and also can 
help query the heavy involvement of private platforms and firms in technological 
infrastructures (Cinnamon 2017).  
 
In summary, the conceptual framework (Figure 1) is used for analysis of the  case study. The 
three aspects of ‘abnormal justice’ will in this view be used to query injustice in relation to 
digital identity. The dimensions will query: ‘misrecognition’ in the use of identity in seeking Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
142 
 to overcome cultural aspects of subordination, ‘maldistribution’ due to resulting 
datafication and its relation to enabling to unequal economic value creation, and 
‘misrepresentation’ will deal with the loss of voice of individuals under surveillance 
mechanisms.

6C. Case Background and Methods  
 
Aadhaar, as undertaken by the Unique Identity Authority of India, works using biometric 
data – iris scans and fingerprints. These are linked to personal information lik e demographic 
data, address, mobile phone numbers and email addresses of citizens resulting in a random 
12-digit digital unique identity number. Aadhaar then is used for a variety of services like 
opening bank accounts, receiving subsidies, or direct benef it transfer (Sarkar 2014, UIDAI 
2014a, 2014b). Enrolment is ‘non -mandatory’ and is to be demand -driven (UIDAI 2014a). 
One of the key services enabled is ‘Electronic Know Your Customer’ (e -KYC). This offers 
electronic authentication and verification of indi viduals with its linkage to a bank account 
made mandatory for governmental subsidy, and mobile number linkage to Aadhaar made 
mandatory as the channel for communication of information by text messages in relation to 
subsidy by the state (MoF 2016). An ‘ope n’ architecture of digital infrastructure under 
Aadhaar was evangelised by proponents42 furthering adoption of Aadhaar across public and 
private sector services as the basis for digitally driven financial inclusion. Based on this there 
has been growth of A adhaar -enabled digital payment services including mobile applications 
and digital payment gateways, with the services developed, delivered and consumed by 
multiple private sector players.  
 
Using Aadhaar, the state focuses on the financial inclusion of the informal sector which 
accounts for 81% of India’s working population with most of this informality concentrated in 
rural and agricultural jobs (The Wire 2018). Given this focus a case study has been chosen 
with the city of Chennai (the capital of the South  Indian state of Tamil Nadu) as the urban 
setting to explore the experiences of two sets of informal workers – cab-drivers and 
 
42 India Stack – a non-state collective of technologists whose expertise and knowledge exchange furthered 
adoption of Aadhaar across pub lic and private sector services : http://indiastack.org/aadhaar/  
Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
143 
 domestic workers (CMDA 2008). The total working population in the Chennai Metropolitan 
Area (CMA) is estimated at 6.8 million in 2016 of which 1.2 million are deemed informal 
workers. In the state of Tamil Nadu – in which CMA is the largest urban area – urban in -
migration has led to an increase in marginal settlements like slums and has driven the 
growth of urban informal labour in the last decade (TNGov 2014). Further, the choice to 
study domestic workers and cab -drivers was done due to their long -standing visible 
presence as traditional urban informal workers and the prominence of these jobs in the 
narratives of informality targete d by Aadhaar as a programme (UIDAI 2008).  
 
An ecosystem of technologies (see Figure 2 below) provided by private sector companies 
and their eventual relation to Aadhaar are of interest for this case study.  
• The first group of interest are the online recruitment portals that started catering 
specifically to ‘blue -collar’ workers in Indian cities. One of the earliest of the portals 
started in 2007 but with the bigger players joining after the advent of Aadhaar. 
These portals enabled job seekers to creat e online profiles detailing their skills and 
applying for jobs listed by potential employers as ads. Jobs listed include domestic 
workers, drivers, couriers and delivery personnel, ‘handymen’, restaurant workers 
etc. The focus of study here was of domestic  workers who use these portals – e.g. 
Babajob, Quikr, Aasaanjobs – to seek employment.  
• The second group of interest are mobile apps and platforms that cater to informal 
gig-based work specifically in urban areas. In recent years, these have grown with 
the advent of smartphones and location -based services. The focus here is on cab -
drivers’ use of ride -hailing apps which have supplemented and then fast replaced 
online recruitment portals as the source of employment opportunities. The drivers 
under study here use their own car, or leased cars via these apps, e.g. Ola, Uber.  
 
In both recruitment portals and apps, the informal worker provides identity documents – in 
many cases a copy of Aadhaar as a paper document – to signal their legitimate identity as a 
potent ial worker.  
 
Other than the above digital platforms there is the presence of digital trust platforms (e.g. 
BetterPlace, Yoti) which are used by recruitment portal and gig -work apps as a business -to-
business service to ‘verify’ informal workers. This verifi cation works by using their 
governmental identity information including photo and personal details cross -verified using 
digital scans against information provided by the informal workers on these digital 
platforms. With Aadhaar these work in two modes. Fir st, online verification using Aadhaar 
e-KYC43 where the UIDAI API with its open, vendor -neutral architecture (UIDAI n.d.), helps to 
confirm validity of personal information. Second, offline verification using XML data -files 
and QR code images encoding Aadh aar-related personal data. As part of informal worker 
onboarding these digital trust platforms use these e -KYC, XML or QR codes to do faster and 
bulk validation of information provided by the workers. The role of these digital trust 
platforms within the ec osystem has not been probed in detail, but it is acknowledged here 
as they provide a basis for the faster scaling up of digital identity use among informal worker 
populations.

Figure 2: Ecosystem of Technologies  
 
The case study is built by thematically analysing mainly interviews (see Table 1) using the 
data -justice framework described earlier (see Figure 1). Semi -structured interviews44 of 
informal workers and worker group leaders were done between January to March 2019 
focused on the daily -life experie nce of using technologies of Aadhaar and its ecosystem. 
Additionally, interviews of digital platform creators (management of a leading ‘blue -collar’ 
recruitment portal interviewed as part of a pilot in Bangalore during April 2017) were used 
to contextualis e the data. Data was further triangulated by field observations and 
interactions, and by the author’s use of digital platforms as a customer on ride -haling apps 
and by the author signing -up as a prospective employee on a recruitment portal. Secondary 
sourc es used included mass media content, government white papers and policy reports, 
technical blogs and documents, and websites of the platforms under study. All these are 
cited where appropriate.

 6D. Findings  
 
This section is structured based on the data -justice framework discussed in earlier sections. 
The injustices arising  due to cultural, economic and political subordination are presented 
respectively as per the ‘abnormal justice’ dimensions.  
 
6D1. Misrecognition  
 
Asymmetry of Recognition  
 
Aadhaar opens new avenues for informal workers to seek employment on digital platforms 
as cab -drivers and domestic workers. Prominently the slogan that the programme is 
branded with, is ‘My Aadhaar. My Identity/Recognition’45 . It is reinforced by government 
advertisement strategies that project use of Aadhaar as the digital means to claim 
recognition for disadvantaged groups – particularly domestic workers. The narratives with 
which Aadhaar has been presented thus plays on the need for recognition in gaining 
employment as an informal worker (Aadhaar UIDAI 2018). Before the Supreme Court ruling 
in late 2018 disallowed private sector use of Aadhaar, digital recruitment and trust 
platforms partnered with UIDAI in enabling e -KYC-based authentication of job seekers, 
showing the ‘Aadhaar verified’ tag on profiles as a signal of trust to r ecruiters, and to 
incentivise verification through Aadhaar for other job seekers (DPL1, ILO 2017). But clients – 
the private household employers on the recruitment portals and cab -riding customers on 
ride-hailing apps – who would employ the services of inf ormal workers are not verified.  
 
The digital verification here mainly works to signal trust by enabling the clients to gauge 
their risk in engaging services of a new employee. But a similar function is not available to 
the workers as the clients themselves  are not verified digitally, resulting in an asymmetrical 
one-way formalisation of surveillance and recognition. Digital verification here replaces 
urban local -area informal referral networks which are traditionally used to seek 
employment (DWA8). There is  a loss of these ‘mutual trust’ networks – sometimes in place 
for decades – which help informal workers recognise potential ‘good’ employers referred via 
word -of-mouth by their peers in both the cases of cab -drivers and domestic workers (DWL1, 
CDM1). Infor mal workers highlight this asymmetry as an issue of safety which hinders their 
easy recognition of potential employers and in not knowing their local work conditions, as 
the traditional peer networks provided a possibility to informally vet households of p otential 
employers. Similarly, this asymmetry manifests again when cab -drivers highlight a need for 
assurance of their on the job safety. Citing recent crimes against cab -drivers by cab -riding 
customers (TOI 2017, HT 2018a, The Hindu 2019), the drivers sug gest Aadhaar -based 
verification of cab -riding customers as a possible solution that mirrors their own verification 
on digital platforms (CDM1). Asymmetrical verification practices deem the informal workers 
only to be trusted after a formal mechanism of ver ification, even when they are provided no 
avenues for formal knowledge of their working conditions and employers.  
 
 
45 In Hindi – Mera Aadhaar, mera pehchaan  – the word ‘pehchaan’ has a technical meaning of identity with 
recognition as the broader meaning.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88

 Absence of Worker Legitimacy  
 
The drivers argue that the stringent identity verification using Aadhaar while joining a digital 
platform – mad e mandatory for all practical purposes – uses their verification only to signal 
safety to cab -riding customers and enable participation in digital payment. Operationally the 
digital identity does not help them gain recognition as legitimate drivers during their daily 
work on the road due to lack of institutional support from the digital platforms, irrespective 
of the driver’s verification status. This is especially evident when issues of customer dispute 
arise or when drivers need to engage with the police (CDL2). Traffic or beat police, as 
reported by cab -drivers, use their prior disposition of domination against informal workers. 
As a result, instances are reported where police use their petty power to verbally abuse and 
intimidate cab -drivers, and in some  cases seek bribes (Thozhilalar Koodam 2019). Cab -
drivers protest this as ‘police harassment’ and seek a means to gain legitimacy of their role 
as a driver (CDP1). Ultimately while a digital identity helps the drivers gain work through 
digital platforms it  does not lend itself to signal legitimacy for such purposes on the road.  
 
The fragmented nature of work on digital platforms is also related to how such issues of 
identity affect the cab -drivers. Consider the case of the long -running transport option of 
auto-rickshaws (also known in other countries as tuk -tuks) where an organised and formal 
unionising of drivers and collective efforts has long existed through ‘auto stands’ (local area 
parking spaces that act also as meeting spots) (Transparent Chennai 2012 ). In many cases 
these organised efforts also have the advantage of strong political party patronage. Auto -
rickshaw drivers resort to their union or auto -stands for institutional support when for 
example they gain negative attention from the police in clai ming their legitimacy as drivers. 
Cabs on the other hand are a recent phenomenon in Chennai, with a strong dependence on 
digital platforms as a basis for atomised self -employment. While digital platforms have 
reduced the infamous ability of drivers (both a uto and cab) to set exorbitant rates and 
engage in undue haggling, the atomised existence of platform -based work leaves drivers – 
cab-drivers particularly – to their own devices to contend with the lack of recognition of 
their urban role as a driver. To ge t over this issue, fledgling efforts have begun on 
unionising. One cab -drivers’ union now issues paper identity cards that they seek to use to 
signal their union membership. These collective efforts of the drivers are directed to claim 
their legitimacy giv en the lack of support on this front from the digital platforms, especially 
when stopped on the road by the police or when challenged by customers (CDM1, CDL1).  
 
In summary, while Aadhaar provides increased employment opportunities, as a social 
impact the push for digital verification is seen to be based on the status subordination of 
informal workers, with their extant social subordination ostensibly extended into the digital 
realm. Here Aadhaar -based verification in its social role is directly used to ass uage security 
anxieties of the clients of digital platforms who hail from middle and higher socio -economic 
classes. But as an identity Aadhaar and its uses on digital platforms is not set up to help 
claim legitimate recognition of the informal workers’ rol e in their workplace and it does not 
address security and safety concerns of the informal workers. Ultimately Aadhaar works 
mainly as a tool of recognition asymmetrically through routine surveillance of the already 
culturally -subordinated groups – digitall y reifying the socially extant inequity of recognition.

 6D2. Maldistribution  
 
Limited Digital Financial Inclusion  
 
Aadhaar is directly related to two aspects of financial inclusion of informal workers into the 
wider economy – as verification for bank acco unts and to enable digital payments. The easy 
opening of bank accounts for previously unbanked populations like the informal workers has 
been the main agenda of Aadhaar in driving financial inclusion. The interviewees’ expected 
benefits and reasons why the y signed up to Aadhaar are tied to narratives of seeking 
economic betterment. These include the possibility to participate in the wider economy 
through the opening of bank accounts, and through the ease of accessing government 
subsidies and getting cash be nefit transfers directly to their accounts. Specifically, they also 
mention the possibilities to access loans from both public and private lenders (various 
interviewees, DWL1, DWN2). These ideas presented by the workers themselves are 
congruent with the go vernmental narrative of Aadhaar -enabled financial inclusion.  
 
While such Aadhaar uses have driven an increase in number of bank accounts, it is 
acknowledged widely46 that in practice Aadhaar mainly acts as yet another paper document 
to prove individuals’ i dentity, as was the case for most of the interviewed domestic workers. 
Such Aadhaar linkages are done mainly due to the state push to make these verified bank 
accounts a channel for receiving government subsidies. Digitally -enabled financial inclusion 
beyo nd this is limited as further formal economic participation using bank accounts does 
not occur easily. This echoes the World Bank finding (Demirgüç -Kunt et al. 2017) on financial 
inclusion where almost half of all accounts opened under the recent governmen tal efforts 
see them being inactive in the last year. This is true particularly for domestic workers whose 
wages are transacted in cash and their bank accounts only work to receive government 
subsidies. With the wider economy that the informal workers enga ge with being still cash -
oriented, cash is still king for their livelihood (various interviewees).  
 
In this context Aadhaar also enables digital financial transactions – like mobile payments or 
digital wallets based on linked bank accounts. But there is no t yet a widespread use among 
the informal workers to undertake daily economic transactions using digital means, beyond 
that which is imposed by digital platforms as in the case of cab -drivers. Even the digital 
financial transactions integrated on ride -hailing apps present some challenges. Digital 
payments are clearly presented as a convenience and attraction to cab -riding customers to 
increase demand of platform usage. To match this customer demand, during the initial 
marketing phase, digital platforms ramp ed up the supply of cab -drivers and focused on 
enabling them to accept digital payments from customers. Drivers were incentivised to join 
with full verification using Aadhaar which was required for their use of digital payments. The 
initial promise was one  of a lower commission taken by the digital platforms with the drivers 
promised higher income (CDL1). Drivers’ experiences in Chennai echo reports from other 
Indian cities where drivers expected and were promised an income around Rs.100,000 per 
month (c.US $%1,500). But they saw their income fall to 20% of this promised amount. As 
 
46 Both from interviewees and from a report ‘Sta te of Aadhaar’ from the Omidyar Network based on a large -
scale survey for 2017 -18 – see Abraham  et al. (2018).  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
148 
 the market matured there was increased competition for passengers but also an increased 
share of income taken as commission by the digital platforms (HT 2018c).  
 
Further specific tactics across the board from major ride -hailing apps cut into driver’s 
income. In 2015 the platforms started levying a fixed fee per week from the drivers over and 
above the per -ride commission. This was designed as a bid to discourage drivers fr om 
switching between apps and to lock them in – as the fixed costs are payable even if the 
driver logs in just once a week. So, a driver using two apps will be charged by both platforms 
and is better off using only one of them to avoid double fixed costs. Such factors have 
brought about a decreasing share of cab -driver share of booking revenue (in one report a 
decrease from 60% to 24%) (ET 2018c). This lowering of income has also pushed some 
drivers into further financial difficulties, especially as some of  the drivers purchase a car 
(and in some cases other items such as phones) via the platform financed through loans tied 
to their contract as a self -employed partner. Their income from the digital platforms then is 
deducted to the tune of the expected regul ar loan payment amounts, levied directly 
through the driver’s bank account. All these factors lock such drivers to the platform for 
employment with declining earnings with them stuck with the major ongoing liability of a 
car loan with additional payment pr ocessing fees payable to digital payment providers 
which cut into the cab -driver’s profit margin.  
 
Impacts of Digital Payment  
 
The adoption of Aadhaar is related to the increase in digital payments within the last few 
years which specifically has impacted informal workers. The Indian government, driven by 
Aadhaar as a core technology has pushed for a ‘state -of-the-art’ digital payment system (RBI 
2019a). Digital identification plays the central role in the long -term strategy of the India 
central bank to ens ure availability of ‘aggregate data’ about credit across the country and to 
drive formal economic participation (RBI 2019b). The culmination of these efforts was the 
demonetisation of currency notes that happened in 2016, which disproportionately affected 
those within the informal sector (Gupta & Auerswald 2019). Nearly 80% of currency in use in 
the economy was taken out of circulation by the Government of India – citing control of 
corruption and ‘black money’, and as a bid to force formalisation of financi al transactions 
within the sizable informal part of the Indian economy. Informal workers saw the immediate 
necessity to participate in the digital economy for their livelihoods and encountered rapid 
changes in employment and their income governed by the di gital platforms. The cash 
crunch not only affected the livelihoods of cash -dependent informal workers, but also the 
informal part of the economy that they depend on, due to the inability of small businesses 
like micro traders who struggled to adapt to digi tal payments (Unni 2018).  
 
Meanwhile, there has been an acceleration in the Indian economy with cashless and digital 
transaction becoming prevalent bringing in a near -exponential increase in the digital 
payments market. Cab -drivers are increasingly depende nt on the digital platform’s 
integrated payment solutions such as digital wallets or card payment interfaces. Though 
these solutions have been reported to have frequent operational delays in transferring 
customer fare payments into the bank accounts of the  cab-drivers (various interviewees). 
Even as the Indian government pushed for the spread of digital payments and reduced the 
transaction costs of taking card payments – which were at 1 to 2% – the digital platforms Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
149 
 have not passed on this reduction in cost s to the driver. Due to these factors lowering their 
income, drivers sometimes see a situation of daily cash crunch. Most of them depend on the 
turnover of cash to manage their mostly cash -based daily living and working conditions 
including paying for petr ol (CDL1, CDL2, various interviewees). To counter this effect of 
digital payments it has been observed that some drivers call potential riders, after accepting 
rides and ahead of pick -up, to agree on cash payments (CDL1, author observation). Though 
not all  can undertake this workaround due to platform -imposed revenue targets.  
 
Thus, the imposition of digital payments affects informal workers disproportionately 
compared to upper and middle socio -economic classes who have access to formal and 
regulated bankin g. This, as an increased benefit to the already formalised section of the 
economy, reinforces existing economic inequality driven by increasing dependence on 
digital payments. With the digital platforms and the gig -economy remaining largely 
unregulated, th e workers face exploitative terms of work and uncertainties even when they 
do participate in digital payment transactions.  
 
Monetisation of Data  
 
At its core, digital verification is presented as a direct economic benefit to informal workers 
with them hand ing over their personal data and sometimes engaging with biometric 
surveillance in the process. This results in a direct loss of control of their personal data in the 
absence of actual legal data protection and defined privacy assurance on digital platform s. 
The platforms derive economic value through monetisation of this data which is available 
without any legitimate guidelines of data -use. An analysis of recruitment portals show that 
monetisation is sought by sale of premium services and subscriptions to both recruiters and 
job seekers alike. The recruiters are able to ‘buy’ contact information in tranches which 
includes personal information of the job -seeker. Additionally, data -driven marketing 
elements like advertisement revenue and cross -selling using d ata-analytics are made 
possible. The observed case was of ‘special offers’ for jobs seekers seemingly targeting 
‘verified’ job -seekers using their profile data which advertised opening a bank account using 
‘easy’ identity verification.  
 
The accumulated dat a due to increasing datafication and new -found digital participation of 
informal workers is available to the platforms as a user -base and dataset which in turn 
forms an economic asset that makes up a core part of their business model (DPL1, DPL2). 
This is seen in the growing economic performance of the platforms – with ride -hailing app 
valuations driven by verified driver numbers (Traxcn 2016), and an ongoing consolidation in 
the recruitment portal market based on their ‘blue -collar’ worker user -base (Modgi l 2017) . 
The state has also bolstered increasing datafication by policies like the National Career 
Service (NCS) government portal which makes Aadhaar mandatory (NCS n.d.) for 
registration for job search. The government portal includes listing of urban in formal worker 
opportunities and works with direct integration to online recruitment portals and ride -
hailing apps.  
 
Thus, Aadhaar -enabled verification of the previously digitally excluded population driven by 
existing economic inequality is the basis on wh ich these business models see a direct 
increase in their user -base enabling extraction of economic value of user data through the Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
150 
 monetisation practices on these platforms. This echoes arguments of ‘informational 
capitalism’ (Andrejevic 2015) – of parting with one’s personal data not necessarily providing 
economic value to the individual but extracted for value in the aggregate by platforms. The 
main issue of equity arises due to the synergy of technology companies’ business models 
and the state push for os tensible mandatory digital securitisation of society under Aadhaar. 
While the workers find new avenues for job -seeking via the digital technologies, enabling 
digital participation in this mode without due protection has helped platforms gain the most 
econo mic value with clients following next in gaining advantage due to digital provision of 
services. The state to a lesser extent gains the ability to enact digital surveillant control on 
the previously invisible informal workers. Ultimately informal workers t hemselves gain the 
least in such an environment where the absence of regulation and data protection directly 
places them in an emerging form of economic subordination.  
 
6D3. Misrepresentation  
 
Informed Consent Issues  
 
Aadhaar’s procedures for ‘informed con sent’ have been contested legally and in practice. 
This is especially because the law that ratified Aadhaar and its defined process of consent 
emerged in 2016 but biometric and other data had been collected since 2010 (ET 2018d). 
Mass collection of consent  was done in what has been referred to as ‘consent camps’ (ET 
2017) with a rather bureaucratic approach to getting consent by rote ‘retroactively’ after 
the wider roll -out. Echoing this the interviewed informal workers acknowledge routine 
signing and filli ng up of forms during enrolment and linkages; undertaken without time or 
capacity to fully understand what is being signed. Moreover, many of the online forms and 
printed terms which collect consent are in English, the dominant language of governance in 
India (author observation). This is true of commercial digital platforms as well. Yet English -
language literacy among informal workers is low.  These issues position the surveilled 
individuals facing a lack of information while giving consent, particularly s o for informal 
workers who are disadvantaged in data -literacy and language (Kaur 2018); a systemic issue 
faced by marginalised groups. As one of the domestic workers puts it linkages are done as 
‘the government says so and we do it. We don’t question it’ ( DWA7).  
 
This has enabled seemingly ‘mandatory’ Aadhaar linkages pushed by private players like 
telecom companies. With the absence of clarity on whether Aadhaar was mandatory or 
voluntary, during the early months of 2018 banks and telecom companies sent co ntinuous 
and officious notifications forcing customers to link Aadhaar to their bank accounts and 
mobile numbers (Manzar 2018). This practice continued until a clear direction on the 
disallowance of private use of Aadhaar authentication came in by Septembe r 2018. The 12 -
digit Aadhaar numbers collected by such mechanisms still reside in the databases of the 
private sector agencies (HT 2018b). This and the pervasive linkages of Aadhaar numbers to 
multiple databases presents a possibility for cross profiling b y the state and private entities; 
again without the explicit or valid informed consent of the individuals who have been 
recorded.

151 
 Disparity in Procedural Redressal  
 
Following the Supreme Court ruling in late 2018, the sharing of Aadhaar numbers and 
linkages to certain private sector services like telecom companies or mobile digital payment 
providers was deemed a security issue that needed to be addressed. In response, specific 
solutions were devised including Aadhaar de -linkage requests (Business Sta ndard 2018) 
using online forms or emails directed to private sector providers, and a solution of a 
temporary ‘Virtual Identity Number’ generated online that would mask the actual Aadhaar 
number (ET 2018b, IE 2018). The identified issues of security were in dependent of the kind 
of users of Aadhaar and cut across all different classes of the society. However, since the 
redressal presented for these issues was mainly depended on online solutions and use of 
the internet. These solutions thus have an unequal rea ch putting vulnerable groups like 
informal workers at a disadvantage.  
 
In fact, there has been a dearth of promotion and wide communication of the solutions to 
security issues, compared to how strongly and in an accessible manner the linkages were 
pushed i n the first place using mobile text alerts. This too affects the vulnerable population 
disproportionately. Interviewees mentioned that while some aspects of the Supreme Court 
ruling and the media conversation around that are known to them, none of them hav e used 
a Virtual Identity Number or sought de -linking as they have not been informed 
authoritatively by telecom companies or the state about these things. Even the cab -drivers 
who are more data -literate relative to the domestic workers group, mention that while they 
use mobiles apps and services like Facebook (CDL1), the engagement with online 
governmental processes is limited and time consuming.  
 
The inequity of these redressal processes being primarily online or smartphone -based is 
compounded by two other  factors – kiosk -driven services and mobile -based ‘one -time -
passwords’ (OTPs) for security. Firstly, government Aadhaar kiosks are expected to serve 
those who cannot access the internet directly. This creates a disparity for the marginalised 
groups who nee d to pay to access kiosk services as opposed to someone who can access 
these free services on the internet. Further, due to delays or higher demand at regulated 
governmental kiosks, the informal workers recount being forced to use unregulated and 
potential ly corrupt private internet browsing centres which charge higher fees that are hard 
for these workers to afford.  
 
Secondly, the safety of Aadhaar transactions is dependent mainly on a ‘secret’ mobile text -
based OTPs (LiveMint 2018). These OTPs are routinel y shared with others – especially due to 
absence of clear information about their usage and because of data -literacy challenges as 
experienced by informal workers, which directly affects their data security. Domestic 
workers – almost all of whom using feat ure phones rather than smartphones – reported it 
difficult to engage with the OTP process. They depend on an intermediary such as a family 
member or acquaintance to read text messages, with many such alerts reported by some as 
having been left unread for a  long period of time. In one case it resulted in delay of subsidy 
reaching the domestic worker’s bank account (DWL1). Further, In case of cab -drivers they 
report submitting Aadhaar paper copies at the time of signing up to be a ride -hailing app 
driver and receiving multiple OTPs on their mobile which were then asked for by customer 
care agents over the phone (CDL1, CDL2). These were effectively used to set up the cab -Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
152 
 drivers with digital payment options related to the apps. The cab -drivers in their 
subordin ated position find it obligatory to share the OTPs and without any opportunity for 
provision of informed consent. Loopholes like this have been highlighted as the basis for 
financial scams where impostors pretending to be officials call up asking for Aadha ar-related 
OTPs (Ganjoo 2018).  
 
Thus, procedural aspects around Aadhaar present a subordination based on digital access 
and data -literacy to create undue disparity based on both information presented and of 
recourse to redressal. Marginalised communities u nder Aadhaar who are pushed to 
mandatorily use digital identity are unable to voice consent in practice due to an 
ineffectiveness or absence of information presented to them. This is further exacerbated 
when procedural solutions as corrective action also c reate disparity due to varying levels of 
digital access.  
 
 
6E. Discussion  
 
Under abnormal justice Nancy Fraser presents a ‘frame’ as the rules of participation across 
the three dimensions of justice. Here the ‘frame’ is the basic societal rules of Aadhaar -led 
inclusive participation of informal workers driven by data and identity. This in practice is a 
heterogeneous assemblage of laws, processes and technologies, which have been queried in 
the above discussion. Taken as a whole the understanding of the ‘wha t’ of justice emerges – 
as equitable participation overcoming subordination in attaining fair recognition, 
distribution and representation. This also presents a means to connect justice to the wider 
context of marginalisation, digital identification and th e datafication of livelihood at large. 
This alongside a further discussion on the data -justice framework follows in this section.  
 
6E1. Justice under Datafication  
 
Culturally, justice can be formulated as fair access to legitimacy, as sought by marginalise d 
groups in their use of digital technology in a bid to overcome the existing social imbalance of 
recognition that acts against them. Additionally, data justice also needs to incorporate the 
impact of participation in the digital economy. Justice then can be queried; asking if 
technology helps overcome cultural subordination or in a negative sense technology acts 
exploitatively to cement existing inequities. Much as Cummings & O’Neil (2015) 
commented, here technology is a ‘mirror’ of the society, in that it  can replicate the extant 
class -based and cultural issues related to marginalisation. Going by the case evidence, data 
justice has to account for the risk that subordination – which existed in cultural and social 
practices experienced by marginalised group s – is digitally reified onto their datafied 
representation and the technological processes they engage with.  
 
Economically, digital identity is intimately connected to economic development and poverty 
reduction programmes as evident in agendas such as ‘id entity for development’ (ID4D 2016, 
Beduschi et al. 2017). But these programmes do not account for the impact of datafication 
that inevitably follows the provision of digital identity. Data in such a case has been seen to 
be intrinsically connected to econ omic value production for commercial players. Clearly, Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
153 
 enough evidence exists that imperfect protection of an already marginalised community can 
further exacerbate their economic condition. But an additional distributive aspect of justice 
then emerges wher e technology helping fair participation of the economically subordinated 
can also enable unfair exploitation of the personal data of the marginalised. Injustice here as 
shown can lead to even further economic subordination based on the newfound digital 
participation of marginalised groups.  
 
Finally, in the political domain, justice as an aspect of representation is intimately connected 
to the wider political voice -lessness of marginalised groups – the solution to which is 
devised through digital technologies and by datafication by recent governmental policies 
and programmes (Gurumurthy et al. 2016). Digital identity is clearly adopted globally under 
such a tenet. Two aspects of datafication form the focus of political justice. Unjust rules for 
consent under processes of datafication deny vulnerable communities a voice in 
participating equitably, putting them at further disadvantage. Redressal efforts to 
technological problems also can be procedurally unfair, aggravating existing marginalisation. 
Justice then is conceptualised as equal ‘voice’ through informed consent and as a fair 
procedural means to question any vulnerability arising due to digital technology.  
 
6E2. Stakeholders of Data Justice  
 
The case study also provides insights into subordinat ion through the ‘who’ of justice – the 
second node. As Fraser (2009) noted, cultural and economic subordination can feed off one 
another – with middle and higher socio -economic groups who already enjoy dominance 
reifying that position in the digital realm.  People can be understood as disparate classes 
within society with digital technology clearly benefitting some over others. This presents an 
opportunity to theorise the role of those who are affected by technology and data under 
the data -justice lens. Exis ting discussion of inequalities related to data (Manovich 2012, 
Andrejevic 2014, Cinnamon 2017) presents the analytical category of users related to 
datafication based on personal data production. For instance, Manovich (2012) presents 
three divisions of t he ‘data -classes’ – the ones who create data, who collect data, and who 
analyse data. But the ‘who’ of data justice based on the above discussion can extend 
analytical categories beyond data production. Especially to contextualise the impact of data 
after its production and use, one can propose a data -class based analysis of stakeholders to 
study effects of datafication and who it benefits. This will invoke the three dimensional 
cultural, economic or political subordination in categorising stakeholders. Fro m the case 
study, we can ascertain that Aadhaar as a means of digital participation unjustly 
subordinates informal workers in relation to other entities:  
• Culturally, informal workers continue to be subordinated to clients who engage 
services using digital platforms. These are the private household employers on the 
recruitment portals and cab -riding customers on apps. Additionally, the state 
through the actions of the police continues to exert local power on informal workers.  
• Economically, data is accumulate d by digital platforms for extraction of economic 
value, presenting an unjust distribution of economic value that is based on the 
newfound and unprotected datafied existence of informal workers.  
• Politically, the state and private entities create disparitie s based on informed 
consent and recourse to procedural solutions that create further digital -led 
vulnerability for informal workers.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88

 6F. Conclusions and Recommendations  
 
The intricate entwinement of surveillance and datafication under digital identity has been 
explored in this paper with a case study of Aadhaar, India’s biometric digital identity 
programme. The paper makes specific contributions in theorisation and through 
presentation of empirical analysis. The paper presents an adaptation of the social ju stice 
theorisation that works synergistically with notions of surveillance and datafication to 
present a data -justice framework. Using a rich empirical analysis, the paper has 
demonstrated the viability of such a framework derived from Nancy Fraser’s (2009 ) work on 
‘abnormal justice’ and its constituent dimensions – cultural recognition, economic 
distribution and political representation.  
 
Empirically, by analysing the emerging surveillant technology of Aadhaar and its networked 
ecosystem, the paper sheds l ight on the social impact of such a programme. While 
surveillance using a digital identity is aimed at an agenda of inclusive participation of the 
disadvantaged in society, the use of a social justice lens points to the complex nature of its 
impacts. Via s tudy of cab -drivers and domestic workers and their use of digital identity and 
platforms, this paper engages with digital identity and its complex networked ecosystem to 
understand consequent datafication, data -flows and their impacts.  
 
Digital identities,  it is found, do produce benefits to marginalised communities like informal 
workers in providing a legal identity both digitally and on paper – as a means of recognition, 
and in helping them participate in the mainstream economy through subsidy disbursemen t 
and by providing access to formal bank accounts. But there are downsides to these benefits 
across the three domains of justice. It is found that digital identity in its current form largely 
prioritises cultural and economic benefits for middle and higher  socio -economic classes. 
Culturally, lower socio -economic classes do not see an improvement in their social standing 
as claimed by the wider identity agenda, while also being affected in the economic domain 
due to personal data being prone to extraction fo r value by commercial digital platforms. 
This is further impacted politically by inequity in voicing needs and due to unfair procedural 
aspects, both of which inordinately affect lower socio -economic classes.  
 
These findings point to an exacerbation rather  than narrowing of inherent inequalities 
between marginalised communities like informal workers and the more formal entities of 
Indian society: commercial businesses including digital platforms, and their middle -class 
clientele. Particularly it presents a complex synergy between governmental and private 
sectors: the data -flows between them and the impact on an already vulnerable population. 
Thus, the implication of the findings would be on both domains of data -subject rights and 
citizen rights. Although the  discussion in the paper is based on the Indian case study, by 
engaging with the contestations for justice under surveillance and datafication, this paper 
has sought to more -widely contextualise the experience of marginalised communities under 
datafication . The paper also proposes understanding data -justice stakeholders using an 
extended ‘data -class’ notion incorporating the complex nature of cultural, economic and 
political interactions enabled by data.  
 
The findings and the theorisation presented here con tribute to the research agenda by 
addressing a specific knowledge gap. The social justice approach used here specifically Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
155 
 answers the call to move away from the top -down technological approach prominently 
taken in presenting digital solutions that seek to enhance equitable participation in society 
(Eubanks 2014). In light of this, the paper has sought to understand everyday routines 
through which individuals use technology and data, and engage with digitally -delivered 
participation and its resultant social impacts. This argument has found favour with authors 
writing on data justice (Taylor 2017, Heeks & Renken 2018). Thus, the theorisation 
presented subsumes aspects of marginalisation, inequality, datafication and surveillance all 
under a lens of justice. Bu ilding further on this the research also seeks to understand the 
wider impact of data and technology in the global South in a way that goes beyond the 
individualistic -centric paradigms of privacy and rights which have been acknowledged as a 
gap in research  (Marwick 2018).  
 
Building on this paper, a future research area that needs closer inspection would be the 
effects of ongoing platformisation of work and wider datafication on informal workers. This 
paper particularly has laid the groundwork to understand the global South context in two 
specific ways which need to be prioritised for future research, especially using the lens of 
social justice. First, this paper has briefly explored the ways in which digital technologies like 
identity and gig -work platforms are intricately connected to collective and individual rights 
of informal workers in a datafied employment landscape. A detailed study of this is 
warranted with focus on the role of formal labour unions and other informal entities, and 
their efforts such a s protests, collective bargaining and membership drives. Second, this 
paper has discussed specific details of how daily practices of informal workers are affected 
due to newfound digital participation on platforms. A wider exploration of the existing 
infor mality and marginality of such global South workers is needed, with a possible 
longitudinal study of informal workers transitioning into gig work. This can shed light on the 
expectation and needs of marginalised users such as informal workers before they t ransition 
onto digital platforms and provide insights into the impact, both positive and negative, once 
they take up gig work.  
 
Finally, the following recommendations for practice can be garnered from the analysis of 
this paper:  
• There is a need to determin e the boundaries of datafication – with particular focus 
on limits of open -architecture systems.  
• Promoting advocacy of data rights among vulnerable populations is needed 
alongside data -literacy improvements.  
• Transparency needs to be demanded from governmental data -sharing arrangements 
especially in the global South.  
• Mechanisms of accountability for monetisation of personal data from governmental 
and private players alike need to be established including its impact on vulnerable 
populations.  
• Advocac y is needed for hybrid -artefact solutions like smart cards, that can work 
stand -alone or when connected, and that can enable digital participation of 
vulnerable populations while mitigating risks of open architecture and multi -purpose 
digital identity.  
These serve to engage with the rampant datafication in the global South in the absence of a 
data -protection law – an issue in a number of countries, including the case of India under 
study.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88

 Case 7: Data Gathering and Justice in the 
Urban Informal Sector  
Views from the Frontline

Abstract  
 
This case considers the challenges faced by civil society organisations (CSOs) in gathering 
and applying data in urban informal contexts. Given that one billion people are estimated to 
live in such contexts globally and that the number continues to grow it is clearly important 
to build understanding of these localities; understanding which CSOs have found difficult to 
acquire. The specific case is the development of participatory data gathering and knowledge 
creation programmes – ‘Views from the Frontline’ (VFL), ‘Action at the Fr ontline’ (AFL) and 
‘Frontline’ – by the Global Network for Disaster Reduction and application of that 
knowledge to influence practice in informal urban contexts.  
 
It challenges tactical  approaches which assume that knowledge will necessarily lead to 
effect ive action, highlighting the barriers faced in the VFL, AFL and Frontline programmes. It 
therefore investigates structural, distributive and instrumental aspects of data justice, 
highlighting the necessity for a nuanced and strategic  understanding which ta kes account of 
power structures, if knowledge is to support effective social transformation. The discussion 
and findings contribute to the developing understanding of data justice and apply this 
specifically to the activity of CSOs in attempting to engage in informal urban contexts. They 
highlight the role of ‘small data’ gathering and application as having both process  benefits  
through the engagement of participants, and impact benefits through increased visibility 
and voice for informal urban populations.

 7A. Introduction  
 
The focus of this study is the challenges for civil society organisations (CSOs) – both large 
international and small local – in acquiring data and acting in urban informal contexts. David 
Satterthwaite sets the scene:  
“Consider the difficulties facing any international agency wanting to improve 
conditions in informal settlements. There is usually no data on who lives there and on 
the deficiencies in provision for water, sanitation, health care, schools, emergency 
servic es and much else besides. Most residents have no title to the land they occupy 
and their right to be there is often contested. Official household surveys do not 
provide data on informal settlements; they only collect data for a national sample. 
Census data , if collected in informal settlements, is not available at ward, sub -ward 
or street level so does not fill the information gap.  There are usually no maps and 
often no street names. Professionals may worry about their safety – or in large 
informal settleme nts about getting lost”  (Satterthwaite, 2018)  
 
Oxfam GB recognised these challenges in their ‘Getting Ready for The Century Of The City: 
2013 -2016 Urban Framework Report’  which noted a ‘bias against urban’ within the 
organisation. It acknowledged limited investment in urban programming:  
“urbanisation of poverty and suffering is a missing story within Oxfam. It is very 
optimistically estimated that 10% of Oxfam GB’s non -emergency funds are directed 
towards urban programmes” (Oxfam, 2012 , p1)  
 
A workshop of 40 senior international non -governmental organisation (INGO) 
representatives noted:  
“Many INGOs, more comfortable in rural settings, have not begun to adapt their 
poverty reduction strategies to the rural -urban demographic shift underw ay in 
developing countries, much less integrate a response to these new developments. 
This is another leading edge for the work ahead”  (Moser et al , 2007, p20)  
 
Several initiatives have addressed the need for data from urban informal contexts. For 
example Desinventar gathers risk knowledge from mixed sources including newspaper and 
other media reports published locally (Desinventar, undated). Slum/Shack Dwellers 
International (SDI) operates in over 7000 informal slum areas in 200 cities, using local 
enumera tors to gather data populating its ‘Know Your City’ database (SDI, undated).  
 
This paper’s study focuses on the ‘Views from the Frontline’ (VFL). ‘Action at the Frontline’ 
(AFL) and ‘Frontline’ data gathering programmes conducted by the Global Network for 
Disaster Reduction (GNDR), which also engaged local enumerators, gathering data from 
local respondents (Views from the Frontline, 2019). GNDR emerged in 2007 as a network of 
local level civil society organisations collaborating on data gathering and campai gning in 
relation to disaster risk reduction. Its data gathering programmes, established in 2009, 
recorded perceptions of risk at community level across communities in 48 low and low -
middle income countries; with the ability to disaggregate data, for examp le as here to focus 
on urban informal contexts. As discussed within the paper, during iterations of the 
programme, data gathering shaped to external frameworks and priorities gave way to data 
gathering framed by respondents’ own priorities, which enhanced its ability to develop Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
164 
 understanding of dynamic informal urban contexts by reducing the filtering of 
presuppositions about such localities.  
 
The programmes assume that acquiring knowledge of these formerly opaque contexts will 
provide a basis for appropria te action, directly by civil society organisations and indirectly 
through advocacy addressed at other relevant institutions. The case demonstrates 
instrumental benefits of the programmes through a dual impact at local, wider subnational 
and national levels  and also reflects critically on limitations of tactical approaches based on 
the maxim ‘sunshine is the best disinfectant’ (Fox, 2015). It foregrounds questions of power 
and its ability to bar or refashion knowledge. In terms of the data justice model this  case 
study considers ways that gathering and application of data in urban informal contexts may 
be undertaken justly or unjustly in relation to those contributing the data. In particular the 
focus is on structural (do interests and power in wider society support fair outcomes) and 
distributive (who gets what) data justice (Heeks and Shekhar, 2019). Its findings also 
discover instrumental data justice effects – in other words fair use of data, resulting in 
positive impacts for those who contribute data – as a notable aspect of these programmes is 
the initially undervalued role of small data looped back at local level, which was seen to lead 
to enhanced social agency in urban contexts such as Delhi, India; Limbe City, Cameroon and 
Kathmandu, Nepal, whereas th e big data aspect directed at institutional contexts proved 
more problematic.  
 
The paper proceeds through the background, which considers earlier means of applying 
data in social development and outlines a framework for considering the effects of different  
forms of knowledge and power on such applications. It continues with discussion of the 
qualitative methods used to gather and analyse the data forming the case study, and 
explores findings from this data, considering the effects of the VFL, AFL and Frontl ine 
methods at local and other scales. The discussion and conclusions explore the contribution 
of this case study to understanding the role of data gathering methods in informing CSO 
roles in informal urban contexts and consider these through a data justic e lens.  
 
 
7B. Background  
 
This case focuses on the data justice implications of gathering data locally to support 
advocacy for social development, focusing on urban informal contexts. These are areas of 
cities fed by inward economic migration and other for ms of internal displacement and 
characterised by lack of registration, lack of rights to accommodation, informal economic 
activity, rapid unmanaged growth, poverty and consequent vulnerability. These 
characteristics mean data and actionable knowledge are d ifficult to secure. Yet, at present, 
we understand relatively little about methods for CSOs to acquire actionable data 
concerning urban informal contexts. There has also been limited analysis of data gathering 
methods in such contexts and limited work on c onsidering such actions through the lens of 
data justice, asking whether data which is gathered is used sensitively and ethically to the 
benefit of its contributors. This case study seeks to address some of these lacunae.  
 
Data, in the broadest sense, has been gathered locally to support social development in 
many ways, predating digital and social media technologies. Much of this work was Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
165 
 considered under the umbrella of ‘Communications for Development’ where media 
included print, audio, radio, photography , film and video. Taking as an example the 
application of film and video, groundbreaking work was conducted between 1968 and 1970 
by Donald Snowden and colleagues with the Fogo Islanders of Newfoundland (becoming 
known as the ‘Fogo Process’) to document an d share experiences of individuals’ lives and 
bring this material before government to advocate for change and support (Quarry and 
Ramirez, 2009, p72 -78). What drew attention to the project was the intention to bring, with 
relative transparency, local know ledge to other scales.  
 
Many other projects drew on this initiative, capitalising on increasingly accessible 
technology so that whereas Snowden’s project used 16mm film with associated costs and 
complexities of processing, editing etc, a participative proj ect undertaken by Braden (2003) 
on behalf of ActionAid using mini digital cameras and laptops was able to bring the medium 
closer to the participants. The process was similar to Snowden’s in that the local conditions 
of villagers in rural Malawi were docum ented and then presented regionally to political 
leaders. As with the Fogo process this work raised questions concerning the participation of 
those contributing knowledge. Braden (2003, p36) reflected that:  
“Methodologies of participation (RRA, PRA, PLA47) are routinely used but the outputs 
are seldom debated and analysed by either participating communities or facilitating 
development workers. Rather they play a token role in the credo of participatory 
development, or, at best they offer fieldworkers some b ackground information, and, 
in the case of ranking, some way of offering a semblance of democratic choice and 
decision -making.”  
 
A wide range of participatory methods of the types referred to by Braden are deployed by 
CSOs at local level (see for example t he collection of community risk assessment 
methodologies (Provention, undated)). Typically results are held locally and not aggregated. 
Braden’s concern about the application of data gathered in this way echoed an increasing 
groundswell of concern about th e nature of participation in development, highlighting the 
tendency for supposed participation to become a performance to validate pre -programmed 
interventions. The conference and associated collection ‘Participation: the New Tyranny?’ 
(Cooke and Kothari, 2001) explored this problem in some detail, predating questions of data 
justice in relation to handling of digital data gathered from local participants.  
 
A large scale approach to participatory data collection aggregated into a global report 
foregrounded further questions about the acquisition and application of local level data. 
‘Voices of the Poor’ (Narayan, 2000) was a large scale study which looked thro ugh the local 
end of the telescope, aggregating 78 participatory assessments from 47 countries to 
combine a total of 40,000 voices, analysed qualitatively to inform policy via the platform of 
the World Development Report 2000/2001. Two research studies wer e conducted on this 
project, McGee and Brock (2001) consider the Voices of the Poor case, comparing it with an 
Oxfam initiative, and finding in both that policy is formulated on the basis of the agency of 
policy actors, only peripherally informed by the te chnical data gathered. Brock et al  (2001) 
move on to consider power, knowledge and the nature of political spaces in the framing of 
 
47 Three widely used appraisal methods: RRA is rapid rural appraisal, PRA is participatory rural appraisal, and 
PLA is participatory learning and action.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
166 
 poverty policy. The study focuses in on the nature of political spaces in which dominant 
narratives are either reinforced or  disputed, drawing on earlier work by Gaventa to suggest 
that ‘invited spaces’ opened by powerful institutions are able to reinforce dominant 
narratives, reflecting McGee and Brock’s finding that political rather than technical 
perspectives shape poverty r eduction policy. They also identify more ‘autonomous spaces’ 
created from below where experiential narratives such as those gathered participatively 
may be heard and may shape policy and action. The overall message is that simply gathering 
and analysing da ta is not sufficient to influence and shape policy. Such data can only achieve 
influence where they run in synchrony with the dynamics of power or, if not, where those 
dynamics of power are addressed.  
 
Analysis of the effects of participative processes and  their application in gathering and 
aggregating local data has highlighted similar issues to those emerging from more recent 
analyses of data gathering initiatives drawing on the data justice framework; for example in 
Heeks and Shekhar (2019), which discus sed four pro -equity data initiatives gathering data 
from marginalised urban contexts. Issues include barriers to ‘instrumental data justice’, 
‘distributive data justice’ and ‘structural data justice’48 resulting from the exercise of power 
in political spac es. This therefore sets the scene for consideration of the case of ‘Views from 
the Frontline’ and the other GNDR programmes that were intended to gather and aggregate 
local data in order to influence national and international policy. The case will demonst rate 
a range of challenges to CSOs in achieving policy influence at different scales. It highlights 
that tactical approaches reflected in the ‘sunshine is the best disinfectant’ maxim are 
insufficient. The case study aims to investigate a gap in understand ing of the role of data in 
informing policy and action in urban informal contexts, considering more strategic 
approaches to its application and in doing so identifying the role of ‘small data’.  
 
The framework used as a basis for analysis is a power/knowled ge matrix (Gibson, 2019) 
(Figure 1), which draws on Gaventa’s idea of political spaces articulated in Brock et al  (2001) 
and in his ‘power cube’ (Gaventa, 2005). This forms the basis of the ‘power’ axis of the cube:  
• Closed spaces  are easily understood as f unctioning behind closed doors, where those 
holding political power are able to make decisions without reference to other 
stakeholders.  
• Invited spaces  are those in which a range of stakeholders are able to participate. 
However in such places the powerful h ost still has control of who speaks and who is 
silent, what weight is put on different contributions and what conclusions are drawn 
from the process, so the power of the invited participants is often extremely limited.  
• Created spaces  are those not constrai ned or controlled by powerful actors but 
established by a range of stakeholders through drawing together partnerships and 
collaborations, therefore allowing them to make significant contributions and to 
shape outcomes.  
 
The knowledge axis reflects findings  from McGee and Brock’s (2001) study and investigation 
of the nature and relevance of situated, scientific and political knowledge (Gibson, 2019).  
 
48 Defined, respectively, as “ fairness in  the results of data being used” (instrumental), “ the (in)equali ty of data -
related outcomes ” (distributive) and “t he degree to which the interests and power in wider society support 
fair outcomes ” of handling, use and impacts of data (structural) (Heeks and Shekhar, 2019, p995).  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
167 
 • Situated/Local knowledge  is that which is held by individuals and socially, based on 
experience. Such knowled ge is contextual and specific, and often not formalised but 
shared verbally.  
• Scientific/Technical knowledge  is the result of formal knowledge production methods 
in educational, scientific and technical institutions. It is often regarded as having 
greater w eight than situated/local knowledge.  
• Political/Institutional knowledge  is actionable knowledge often informing policy and 
action which results from the political interpretation of scientific/technical 
knowledge and to a much lesser extent situated/local kn owledge. In many contexts 
this has greater weight and influence than other forms of knowledge.  
 
The matrix identifies two extremes:  
• At top left, knowledge is defined institutionally, through interpretation of 
scientific/technical and situated/local knowled ge in line with institutional priorities, 
and this is applied in closed spaces to impose preferred political priorities. Local 
actors therefore make very limited contributions of knowledge and are shut out of 
decision -making processes.  
• At bottom right, soc ially created and applied knowledge is that which is derived 
primarily from situated/local sources and which is applied in created spaces in which 
a range of stakeholders have power and influence. They are therefore able to bring 
such knowledge to bear to shape outcomes in line with their concerns and priorities.  
These two extremes contrast the institutional imposition of power and manipulation of 
knowledge with social creation and application of knowledge. The shading of the matrix 
implies a spectrum of ap plications of knowledge and power in different contexts.  
 
The framework is employed to investigate barriers within the CSO community to achieving 
the different forms of data justice, particularly in the poorly understood arena of informal 
urban communities . 
 Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
168 
  
Figure 1: Power/knowledge matrix  
 
The matrix identifies different kinds of space where knowledge and action interface, with 
differing power relations. Concerning the power axis invited spaces are more seductive to 
social actors than are closed, as they offer the appearance of participation, though as the 
framework highlights this appearance is typically illusory as the powerful hosts shape 
involvement and outcomes. Gaventa suggests that engaging with formal politics by 
invitation into spaces control led by institutions does not confer power but co -opts the 
participants within the existing system. He therefore suggests that power relationships are 
only disrupted in ‘created spaces’ which step outside current structures and confer agency 
on participants . The knowledge axis acknowledges the privileging of political/institutional 
knowledge over situated/local knowledge which, though undervalued, is critical given the 
increasing recognition – for example in the capabilities approach (Sen, 1999) – that 
devel opment depends on context -specific and multi -dimensional understanding.  
 
The dimensions in the power/knowledge matrix can be related to those highlighted by 
Heeks and Renken (2018) in their discussion of structural data justice (Figure 2):

Attempts to affect structur al and distributive aspects of data justice are seen, according to 
this schema, as requiring shifts in the matrix between the upper left and lower right zones,

 which signify transition from large institutionally controlled datasets and analyses controlled 
by those power structures to ‘small data’49 accessed locally and supporting agency (agency = 
power to, structure = power over) (see Figure 3).

7C. Methods  
 
The method adopted in analysing the case is action research, from a participant observer 
perspective. The author was a co -director of GNDR and the project leader from 2008 -2016  
(with continuing ad hoc involvements) on development and deployment of the three 
programm es mentioned earlier and considered in this case study:  
• ‘Views from the Frontline’ used a questionnaire method to gather local perceptions 
of progress in disaster risk reduction.  It was initially conducted three times: in 2009, 
2011 and 2013.  Another VFL  was then undertaken in 2019.  
• ‘Action at the Frontline’ added a local level participatory process for communities to 
interpret data, identify and undertake actions, and was undertaken between 2011 
and 2015.  
• ‘Frontline’ was a further development which stren gthened local level knowledge 
gathering and application of data for local action; from 2013 to 2017.  
 
The author conducted doctoral research 2008 -2011 (Gibson, 2012) on the network and its 
programmes concurrently with his tenure, creating a space for forma lised critical reflection 
 
49 Small data is used here to describe da tasets gathered locally which are unlikely to be sufficient in scale for 
quantitative statistical analysis but are sufficient in either quantitative or qualitative terms to be drivers for 
local usage through dialogue and negotiation.  
Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
170 
 on action. His approach is rooted in the thinking of Freire, whose ‘participative action 
research’ was based on social participation in action and reflection:  
“. . . reflection – true reflection – leads to action. On the other han d, when the 
situation calls for action, that action will constitute an authentic praxis only if its 
consequences become the object of critical reflection.”  (Freire, 1970, p48)  
 
Related approaches include ‘action science’ (Argyris and Schon, 1989) and ‘co -operative 
inquiry’ (Heron, 1996). All have at their heart close engagement with the action scene allied 
to individual and corporate critical reflection on action. Therefore they are likely to lead to 
informed adaptation of the action, following the principl e of the Kolb (1984) cycle of 
experiential learning, as well as generating research outputs. This was the case as will be 
seen in the evolution of the programmes under consideration.  
 
GNDR, established in 2007, had a very small secretariat of two staff, in cluding the author. 
Lacking accumulated bureaucracy it had considerable flexibility to perform real collaborative 
experiments in pursuing its goals. The research interests of the author were understood by 
the network secretariat and membership, creating op portunities for ‘member check’ (Yin, 
2003) on provisional conclusions reached by the researcher. Management of the role 
therefore applied an integrated ‘reflective practitioner’ approach (Schon, 1983), while 
collaboration with other members of GNDR reflect ed the principle of Heron’s co -operative 
enquiry (Heron, 1996).  
 
The case draws on six types of data gathered through the action research:  
 
1. Background and context: archive and historical sources primarily from the network 
and from the UN agency responsible  for implementing the  International Strategy for 
Disaster Reduction (UNISDR, now the UN office for Disaster Risk Reduction: UNDRR).  
 
2. Qualitative data on network interactions: email correspondence; online discussions; 
surveys and questionnaires; GNDR report s and presentations.  
 
3. Network praxis:  data from the three VFLs conducted in 2009, 2011 and 2013, the 
AFLs from 2011 -2015 and Frontline 2013 -2017; learning reviews undertaken on VFL 
in 2009 and 2011; records of GNDR global workshops held in 2009 and 2013.  
 
4. Observational data and reflection:  personal records and narrative; research 
doctorate and subsequent research papers.  
 
5. Structured collaboration:  through co -production and critical discussion with a group 
of small NGO leaders, creation of case studies of local knowledge gathering and 
action, c ompiled in a journal special issue (Gibson and Norton, 2019) and a dedicated 
website ( www.drr2dev.com ). 
 
6. Fieldwork:  in the Philippines, meeting with CSO representatives and CSO networks 
(2019) who had been involved wi th the GNDR programmes, in order to provide 
insights and updates on the Philippines material considered in this case study.

 7D. Findings  
 
In this section, several phases of implementation of VFL, AFL and Frontline are examined 
and related to the power/kno wledge matrix as a means of investigating the contribution of 
the case to understanding the application of data by CSOs in urban informal contexts 
through a data justice lens. The initial implementation of the VFL programme is described, 
showing the challe nges in applying data for desired impact and in line with local 
expectations which led to the further development of AFL and Frontline. Applications of 
Frontline in three specific urban informal contexts are discussed, along with more general 
outcomes loca lly, nationally and internationally. Further structural challenges are 
considered, leading to another revision of the programme in 2019.  
 
7D1. Implementation and Development of the ‘Views from the Frontline’ 
Programme  
 
GNDR was established with a goal of i nfluencing disaster risk reduction frameworks 
established by UNISDR. The Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) spanned 2005 -2015, 
followed by the Sendai Framework for Action (SFA). GNDR had a stated intention to roll out 
a local level assessment of progress foc ussed on implementation of the HFA. This bottom up 
assessment would complement the top down attempt by the UN to monitor 
implementation of the HFA (Gibson and Wisner, 2016). GNDR’s method employed a 
questionnaire with approximately 40 questions related to the five priorities of the HFA, with 
responses scored on a five point Likert scale.  
 
Versions were created for community, CSO and local government respondents. GNDR 
member organisations organised, mobilised and conducted the surveys in 2009 based on 
traini ng by the network. 5290 responses were gathered from the respondent groups and a 
further 2035 from women’s and children’s groups. 48 countries in Africa, Asia and the 
Americas were covered. Data were analysed to produce a range of summary charts which 
were  included in a report presented to the UNISDR biennial conference monitoring progress 
of the framework. The purpose of doing so was advocacy, so the focus was on key messages 
drawn from the data.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
172 
  
Figure 4: A breakdown of different responses to HFA progress showing ‘fading -out’ of 
perceptions of progress from national level to communities ‘at -risk’50 
 
For example, Figure 4 was used to support the contention that experience of the impact of 
the disaster reduction framework was greatly reduced at local level compared with national 
level reporting. It also specifically emphasised the particularly negative perception of 
women, highlighted in red. The report attracted a lot of attention and coverage, effectively 
presenting a body of data to underpin the key messages. The then head of UNISDR said of it:  
“Thanks to that report there is now a face, a recognition and an understanding of 
what you represent. Not because you a re NGOs or civil society but through what 
you have done. The work you have done and you’ve put that forward. My feeling 
is that you have done something quite remarkable through that work.” 
(Margareta Wahlstrom: UN Assistant Secretary for Disaster Risk Redu ction, 
speaking at Global Workshop 27 January 2010. In Gibson, 2012, p157)  
 
However it became clear that the messages and language put forward by the network, 
including the terms ‘Views from the Frontline’ and ‘Local Action’ were rapidly appropriated 
by UN ISDR, who in the preparatory material for the following progress conference said:  
“The Global Assessment Report 2011 recognizes local perspectives and 
incorporates “ Views from the Frontline” from civil society organizations. But, to 
what extent do our int erventions lead to improved conditions in the places where 
the vulnerable live and work? Are all our programs and policies targeted enough 
at supporting local action and building on local assets? How can we accelerate 
finance and increase investment in loc al action ? What do we need to do to make 
this happen?” (Extract from second announcement of UN Global Platform for 
Disaster Risk Reduction, 17 November 2010. UNISDR, 2011. In Gibson, 2012, 
p177. Emphasis added.)  
 
50 GAR is the Global As sessment Report of progress in implementation of the UN Disaster Risk Reduction 
frameworks, which is published biennially. The assessment of progress in the chart associated with GAR is 
based on self -assessment by responsible ministries within national gov ernments.

This appropriation might have been regarded  a success if it led to demonstrable change in 
policy and practice. However, the chair’s statement at the conclusion of the 2011 
conference did not indicate any such change in policy; the messages appeared, rather, to 
have been absorbed within the establis hed policy formulations.  
 
Views from the Frontline was conducted using a similar format and methodology in 2011, 
with increased participation of 20,000 respondents in 69 countries, and in 2013, with 21,500 
respondents in 57 countries. However learning revi ews conducted with participating 
member organisations revealed disquiet about the value of the process (GNDR, 2012). The 
term “extractive” was used, and one organisation asked how the circle of returning the 
information for use by the people who provided i t (what would later be seen as a ‘small 
data’ approach) could be completed. These responses highlighted a practical concern about 
the direct usefulness of the exercise to the respondents. Responses to the VFL surveys were 
markedly homogeneous leading to th e suggestion that respondents did not have access to 
information to assess the questions being posed. It was recognised in discussions within 
GNDR that the method elicited local views on the HFA framework, but did not allow local 
articulation of experience  and knowledge. A local level respondent said of similar surveys 
that they asked “what do you think about our framework?” rather than “what do you 
think?”. This and other feedback prompted an assessment and redesign of the programme, 
based on local partici pative risk mapping, with the intention of emphasising local knowledge 
and creating outputs which would also have local relevance.  
 
The Views from the Frontline programme had aimed to engage in closed and invited spaces 
such as UN conferences, offering in relative terms ‘big’ data related to the institutional 
knowledge contained in the UN frameworks, created through political negotiation by 
signatory countries. It is thus located in the top left of the power/knowledge matrix (see 
Figure 5).  
 Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
174 
  
Figure 5: Views from the Frontline positioning in power/knowledge matrix  
 
 
As with the assessment of uptake of knowledge from the ‘Voices of the Poor’ survey (McGee 
and Brock, 2001), political priorities were overlaid on the findings and as a consequence 
their influ ence on policy and implementation was slight. Structural data (in)justice was at 
play here as the system within which GNDR attempted to secure influence was structurally 
unreceptive to challenges to its policy orthodoxy, and was able to utilise aspects of its 
assemblage such a control of spaces for discourse and control of language to maintain 
stasis. Alongside the structural challenge there was an internal challenge as the membership 
questioned the distributive and instrumental data justice of the programm e, complaining 
that it was extractive and did not have direct local benefits.  
 
External and internal challenges to the programme prompted assessment and redesign. The 
secretariat suggested this should be based on local participative risk mapping, an activi ty 
with a long pedigree in supporting community participation and action. It would have the 
intention of emphasising local knowledge and creating outputs which would also have local 
relevance.  
 
7D2. Development of the Frontline Programme  
 
The format, titled ‘Frontline’, which emerged from development work by the network 
secretariat and initial piloting of the programme in Peru in 2013 was conceptually related to 
local level participatory assessments discussed earlier. It differed in three w ays. Firstly it was 
highly simplified, reducing the scale of training of the enumerators to enable it to be widely 
deployed. Secondly the consultation, based on a structured conversation leading to the 
respondent nominating their highest priority threats, consequences, actions and barriers, 
Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
175 
 allowed free text responses so that respondents could express their own insights rather 
than responding to a questionnaire. Qualitative analysis coded the free text responses in 
order to aggregate them. Thirdly the prior itisation process allowed data to be aggregated at 
local level (for local application) and also at subnational, national and international level. 
These design aspects met the requirements identified in learning reviews for a process 
which allowed local kno wledge to be gathered, allowed that knowledge to be used locally, 
but which also provided a larger -scale analysis to be used in national and international 
advocacy.  
 
Figure 6, below, contrasts the epistemic focus of the Frontline programme with that of 
Views from the Frontline, showing that Views from the Frontline (blue) is driven by an 
external framing, whereas Frontline (orange) is driven by local perceptions and knowledge.  
 
 
 
Figure 6: Contrasting the epistemic focus of ‘Views from the Frontline’ and ‘ Frontline’  
 
As a further effort to ensure local relevance of the Frontline programme, a companion 
programme, ‘Action at the Frontline’ provided a framework for community consultations, 
action planning and implementation based on the locally analysed Frontl ine data. At other 
scales the data was analysed and then visualised using a ‘Tableau’ interactive online 
visualisation platform (Figure 7) which allowed the data to be sliced and diced by locality, 
risk zones, and by particular threats, consequences, actio ns and barriers51.

Case studies and anecdotal evidence indicate that the application of data locally through 
community consultation and action were valued by the local NGOs involved in the 
programme. The implementation of the programme in India is used to illustrate this. It  was 
focused on Assam, Bihar, East Delhi, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Uttarakhand; localities 
selected to represent a range of risk zones. The analysis and report (SEEDS, 2016) 
aggregated data to indicate priorities in different risk zones. Figure 8 contrasts t he threats 
prioritised by respondents in rural and urban risk zones:  
 
 
Figure 8: Urban and rural priority threats according to Frontline India  
 
In line with findings from the 21 countries involved in the programme, risk profiles were 
found to be very context specific, which in itself underscored an important message 
addressed to institutional actors above moving from large scale towards local, con text

 specific actions in implementing disaster reduction policy. The report provided further detail 
on each zone. Findings for East Delhi stated:  
“Waste and water pollution, alcoholism, crime (again mainly women 
respondents) and infrastructural damage were  identified as the greatest threats. 
Violence (physical, domestic, sexual, child abuse); blocked roads from garbage 
and rain; psychosocial impacts; and lack of clean drinking water were some of the 
direct consequences adding to the threats. The primary bar riers perceived were 
lack of community’s commitment; followed by the fear of reprisals (both within 
the community and with concerned authorities), unplanned urbanization: 
clustered shacks next to highways or on the streets without clear drainage system 
and highly limited spatial scope, poor sanitation and hygiene and poverty”  
(SEEDS, 2016, p21)  
 
Data gathering and analysis in East Delhi underpinned and reinforced local action which 
included establishing community associations, one of whose actions was local  level data 
gathering using a mobile phone app to document and report local hazards such as garbage 
accumulations and unsafe electric cabling (Gupta et al , 2019). Generation and application of 
data in this way addressed a particular political challenge exp erienced in informal urban 
communities, where the lack of registration and voting rights amongst such populations 
makes them a low priority in the eyes of local political leaders. The campaigning and 
advocacy leverage created by making the limited services  provided in urban informal areas 
more clearly visible in the public eye through gathering and aggregating data – naming and 
shaming – provoked greater action on the part of the local government (pers.comm. Gupta, 
2017)  
 
Data gathering and application in i nformal urban contexts in Limbe City, Cameroon  
 
Frontline’s focus on accessing local knowledge and experience directly, rather than 
consulting respondents in relation to an external framework enabled it to provide specific 
contextual understandings of comp lex social contexts in urban informal settlements. The 
Frontline data gathering and analysis process was applied in Limbe City, Cameroon. A 
coastal city exposed to climate related disasters and also vulnerable to eruptions from 
nearby Mount Cameroon, the l evels of poverty in informal areas of the city led to a range of 
other more pressing disaster impacts. These were revealed in the responses gathered 
through structured interviews.  
 
Aggregated responses revealed the highest priority threats faced by the loc al population: 
seasonal flooding, coastal erosion, fire, landslide and poverty. In one low -lying area, Lower 
Motowoh, discussion of these findings led to agreed community actions to address clogging 
of the main watercourse because of poorly managed waste. Actions combined clearing the 
watercourse and promoting better waste management. Initial disinterest from local 
government and resistance from some community members were influenced by the visible 
actions and the resulting reclamation of low -lying land whi ch was now habitable and led 
eventually to greater community participation and government support. The process of data 
gathering and presentation therefore triggered an iterative process engaging both 
community and government (Wong and Aka, 2019)

 Data gat hering and application in informal urban contexts in Metro Manila, the 
Philippines  
 
One of the world’s mega -cities, Metro Manila has a population of over 21 million and is 
growing rapidly. Within sight of the city’s skyscrapers many settlers have moved in to urban 
informal areas along the city’s waterways, living in cramped, hazardous, often temporary 
accommodation. Due to their informality, estimates of the scale of this population are 
approximate, ranging from 104,000 families (CDP, 2015a) to one million people (pers. 
comm. Lorna Victoria, CDP, 2019)52. 
 
The city government put forward mass relocation of populations as a resolution of the 
problems faced by these residents. However the proposed locations are relatively remote 
from the city, dislocating people from their communities and creating huge problems in 
either commuting back into their workplaces or securing other livelihoods. Residents have 
therefore resisted this strategy.  
 
The Action at the Frontline local level data gathering proc ess identified a range of threats 
faced by residents and also highlighted their interlocking nature (CDP, 2015a) : 
• Disaster: flood, fire, earthquake, garbage  
• Economic: lack of jobs, difficulty in finding a job, vices due to lack of economic 
activities  
• Peace and order: youth riot, use and selling of illegal drugs  
• Social cohesion: gossip, fights  
• Housing and relocation: landlessness  
 
These findings were played back to meetings which included community members and also 
representatives of local or ganisations and local government. These meetings were the 
starting point for developing a community plan to effectively and efficiently reduce the 
threats. A field visit by the author in 2019 including meetings with CDP revealed that 
progress is slow, sugg esting further iterations of such data gathering and dialogue processes 
are needed.  
 
Overall impacts of the pilot programme  
 
Frontline implementation and associated local ‘Action at the Frontline’ case studies during 
three pilot phases of Frontline were co nducted in 30 countries in Latin America, Asia, Africa 
and the Caribbean. The last of these phases, spanning 15 countries, was linked with local 
‘Action at the Frontline’ in 11 countries. Outcomes at local and national level are 
summarised below:  
 
Locally  the case studies of action based on the local analysis of Frontline data indicate that 
this locally co -created knowledge was applied to inform and motivate local action. Cases in 
India, Cameroon and the Philippines have been detailed above. In Indonesia lo cal priorities 
for action contrasted with institutional perceptions leading to a focus on livelihoods based 
on strengthening tourism as a means of reducing illegal activity which created risk. In 
 
52 CDP is the Centre for Disaster Preparedness, a national NGO based in Manila, the Philippines.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
179 
 Kiribati the activity led to establishment of multi -stakehol der partnerships capable of 
organising mangrove restoration and other risk reduction activities. In Malawi a respondent 
cited the benefits of action focused on local priorities as a contrast to the more usual 
project -based activities defined by external fu nders. The overall assessment of the cases 
was that they stimulated local level collaborations based on local priorities.  
 
Regionally  the Frontline report in India (SEEDS, 2016) was used as a basis for multi -
stakeholder consultations. In the Philippines th e programme produced detailed reports in 
six regions which were presented nationally (CDP, 2015) and also triggered regional 
collaborations for action, notably in Carles region where a substantial multi -stakeholder 
collaboration was developed to drive deve lopment in the region (Molina, 2019).  
 
Nationally  some evidence was recorded of impacts of the data. During these pilot phases 
respondents reported using aggregated data to influence government policy for risk 
reduction in Chile, Columbia, Kiribati and Par aguay (Gibson and Wisner, 2016). In Indonesia 
the participating CSOs reported that presentation of Frontline data and reports at the 
national platform (PLANAS) and the National Disaster Management Agency had led to 
inputs to the national and regional disas ter risk reduction policy (YEU, 2015).  
 
Assessing this phase of the programme in relation to the power/knowledge matrix suggests 
that focus had shifted to the bottom right hand corner, where situated knowledge was 
engaging in created spaces (see Figure 9).  
 
 
Figure 9: Frontline positioning in power/knowledge matrix  
 
Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88

 This was ‘small’ data gathered, analysed and used locally (though also aggregated into larger 
databases for national/international use) and its local application was in contexts where 
participants had some agency, and indeed sometimes increased their agenc y through cycles 
of action. In some case studies the uptake of data drove a cycle of increasing local 
participation and emerging engagement with other actors such as local and national 
government, engaging in invited spaces – those where the hosts normally  exerted control 
over proceedings and outcomes – and in scientific/technical discourse – where 
situated/local knowledge is often discounted, as illustrated in Figure 9. Engagement in these 
spaces appeared to occur disruptively, through ‘legitimate subversi on’ rather than within 
accepted institutional framings as capabilities and confidence of local consortia grew 
iteratively (Gibson et al  2019). Thus this local level application of small data appeared to 
achieve a higher degree of structural data justice th an the previous programme, through co -
creating a space or structure in line with local interests and priorities. It met the network 
members’ requests for distributive data justice by providing greater resources for 
marginalised groups. And the case studies  during the pilot implementation offer examples 
of instrumental data justice, with data stimulating actions and hence impacts in line with 
local priorities.  
 
7D4. Return to Views from the Frontline  
 
Evidence of the pilot phases of the Frontline programme were therefore that it met the 
network members’ request for a data gathering exercise that had local level application, and 
there was some evidence that it was also used at national scale to influence policy. The 
programme was intended to be impl emented more widely after the pilot phases. However 
this phase stalled. Although the GNDR Board and CEO had requested its development, they 
struggled to understand the approach, feeling more comfortable with the questionnaire 
based survey. Thus, after inte rnal deliberations GNDR set out to design a new programme, 
taking the original name Views from the Frontline (GNDR, 2019).  
 
This reflected the desire within the secretariat to be directly assessing the UN Sendai 
Framework for Action, as the earlier Views f rom the Frontline programmes had done, and 
the desire of potential funders to support such an action. However demand from the 
network’s membership led to the new programme retaining the local level component. 
Therefore this programme, being initially deplo yed at large scale in 50 countries over a 
three -year period, has at its heart the earlier questionnaire style exercise, aimed at 
conducting a complementary assessment of the UN Disaster Reduction framework, and also 
in this iteration the Sustainable Develo pment Goals and the Paris Agreement on Climate 
Change. Alongside this assessment it includes the Frontline -style local level prioritisation 
exercise, aimed at capturing local knowledge and using it as a basis for local action.  
 
A pilot exercise for this ne w approach conducted in the Philippines with 2535 respondents 
analysed findings from the two elements of the survey (CDP, 2018). It showed that distinct 
risk priorities were identified in different localities and risk zones, and linked these to 
options for  local action and to particular barriers to be considered. As with the earlier 
Frontline programmes the data gathered locally was actionable. The main finding of the 
questionnaire style assessment was of a consistent gulf between local community and local 
government perceptions of progress on all issues considered, with local government Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
181 
 consistently positive and communities consistently negative about progress. This reiterated 
findings from earlier Views from the Frontline surveys, but raised the question o f the utility 
of this finding, due to the barrier of institutional resistance experienced previously.  
 
The intention in the new programme appears to be to locate the project within two zones in 
the power/knowledge matrix (see Figure 10).  
 
 
Figure 10: Loca ting Views from the Frontline 2019 in the power/knowledge matrix  
 
The inclusion of the local level consultations, local knowledge generation and action 
(similarly to Frontline) is located at bottom right, in created spaces where agency can be 
exercised on the basis of situated knowledge. The questionnaire element, intended to 
assess the UN Disaster Reduction framework and also the Sustainable Development Goals 
and Paris Agreement on Climate Change, does not have any design elements addressing t he 
challenges faced by the earlier and similar Views from the Frontline project. However while 
the programme may not achieve impact at international/national level it may be 
strategically necessary to include this element to maintain organisational credibi lity and 
funding. It may be that such a pragmatic approach recognises the limitations of structural 
data justice, therefore including an element previously found ineffective but which is 
nevertheless necessary to allow the other elements of the programme t o proceed, in order 
to secure distributive and instrumental data justice.

 7E. Discussion and Conclusions  
 
This case focuses attention on civil society organisations as creators and users of data, and 
directs attention specifically to urban informal con texts, which it is suggested have been 
poorly understood by civil society organisations as well as by other institutional actors. 
Whilst the programmes considered in this study are not exclusively devoted to urban 
informal contexts it shows that the local level methodology, ‘Frontline’, is able to gather 
data explicating very specific contexts, including urban informal, through its open -ended 
qualitative method, contrasting with a framework -driven questionnaire approach such as 
that used in Views from the F rontline. There was a transition during the course of the 
programme from an international to a local focus in the application of data. In the first 
iteration the destination was international and institutional. In the second iteration the 
destination was l ocal, the data looped back to its contributors as per the tenets of the small 
data approach. The contrast is illustrated in Figure 11.  
 
 
Figure 11: Contrasting emphasis of Frontline and Views from the Frontline  
 
The third iteration, as discussed, includes both local and global elements.  
 
The challenges in achieving institutional influence in the Views from the Frontline 
programme echo those highlighted by McGee and Brock (2001) and by Brock et al  (2001) in 
their assessments of the large scale ‘Voices of the Poor’ programme. In both cases structural 
data justice – ‘power over’ – is in play. As Fox (2015) discusses, tactical approaches are 
insufficient to achieve influence in these closed institutio nal spaces. The power/knowledge 
matrix reflects the dominance of ‘political knowledge’ over technical and scientific 
considerations and over the even less privileged place of situated knowledge created locally. 
In both cases attempts to insert local perspe ctives and knowledge into the institutional 
discourse have proved ineffective.  
 
In terms of the disaster reduction discourse Gaillard (2019) challenges an institutional 
hegemony which imposes an orientalist view of disasters in the prevailing institutional  
discourse on the topic, therefore failing to hear voices or views from the frontline. He 
Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
183 
 argues for the importance of local researchers analysing local disasters using local 
epistemologies, suggesting therefore that it is impossible to bridge a dominant w estern 
epistemological perspective with that prevailing locally. This is an extreme position but it 
does echo the disjunction between community and government perceptions reported by 
Views from the Frontline (Figure 4) and in the later Views from the Front line pilot (CDP, 
2018). Therefore more strategic applications of data gathering and application must be 
considered, as Fox also argues.  
 
GNDR’s work in piloting the Frontline programme, dealing with small data in created spaces, 
is located by the power/kno wledge matrix  in contexts where greater agency is available 
and/or can be accumulated in the sequence represented below:  
 
Small data → local social visibility → stimulus for social action → social agency  
 
As such this reveals a strategic approach to applic ation of data for development. However 
this initiative reveals an organisational challenge which can also attach to Gaillard’s critique 
of institutional hegemony, as GNDR has faced pressure internally and externally – related to 
organisational credibility and funding – to return to the former survey format. This has led 
to pragmatic trade -offs in which the questionnaire assessment of several global frameworks 
has been reinstated, now complemented by the local level data gathering and application 
process. It  remains to be seen whether the increased complexity of the resulting 
programme can be sustained. Piloting has demonstrated that the complexity of the dual 
approach creates an additional workload. App -based data recording is being developed to 
reduce this load, so accommodating the politically pragmatic dual approach has come at a 
cost (pers.comm. VFL project manager, June 2019).  
 
Conclusions: CSOs  
 
The case offers several messages to CSOs considering data gathering and application:  
 
1. The challenges of engag ing in institutional spaces, where political considerations 
outweigh technical and scientific, must be understood.  
2. Tactical approaches – sunshine is the best disinfectant – are likely to fail and more 
strategic approaches should be considered.  
3. Application of small data in local contexts creates significant opportunities to 
contribute to change processes as this data can inform understanding of complex 
contexts such as urban informal settlements and form a valuable part of iterative 
processes of action and r eflection, incrementally increasing ability to influence local 
institutions through strategies such as ‘legitimate subversion’.  
4. Working strategically may entail, as in the case of the Views from the Frontline 2019 
iteration, undertaking activities to maint ain organisational stature even though these 
may not be intrinsically effective. That this is the case reflects a reality of structural 
data justice in systems with dominant and powerful actors.

 Conclusions: Data justice model  
 
Structural data justice  
 
The case has highlighted aspects of structural data justice and injustice regarding the 
application of data gathered through the VFL, AFL and Frontline programmes. It suggests 
that the imposition of power on knowledge, limiting the impact of data and analy sis on 
policy, necessitates a pragmatically strategic approach which has resulted, in the final 
iteration of VFL in 2019, in parallel approaches intended to engage in the two extremities 
reflected in the power/knowledge matrix – institutionally created and  controlled knowledge 
and socially created and applied knowledge. The case can further be seen to suggest that 
managing structural data justice is a dynamic rather than a static process, requiring 
iteratively strategic approaches to ensuring structural dat a justice.  
 
Distributive data justice  
 
The case has shown that even in socially and ethically motivated applications of social data, 
distributive data justice can be neglected. In the case under consideration it was feedback 
from network members that highl ighted this issue, demonstrating a need to act critically 
and reflectively in the handling of data, rather than assuming an ‘end justifies the means’ 
approach.  
 
Instrumental data justice  
 
Iterative learning by GNDR during the implementation period of VFL, AFL and Frontline 
highlights unanticipated instrumental benefits of these programmes. The call from CSOs, 
representing communities, for direct local application of the programme led to the ‘small 
data’ aspect being emphasised, and this in turn led to both ‘process’ and ‘outcome’ benefits 
from this small data aspect of the programme. Illustrated in the cases from East Delhi, 
Limbe City and Metro Manila, the process led to instrumental benefits of local engagement, 
dialogue and collaboration which in turn str engthened local action. There were outcome 
benefits of influence on local government.

 7E1. Recommendations  
 
This case study, focusing on gathering data locally and applying it both locally and remotely, 
highlights the dominance of structural data justice issues and the need to work strategically 
rather than tactically:  
 
Data to influence institutional discourse  
 
As regards practice it focuses on such activities undertaken by civil society actors and 
recommends caution in conducting data gathering a ctivities designed to influence 
institutional policy, recognising the ability of institutions to subjugate such data to their pre -
existing discourses.  
 
Data to support local collaboration and action  
 
It highlights the potential of small data gathering acti vities integrating with local uptake and 
action, not only in local community mobilisation but in incremental engagement with 
institutions at local level.  
 
Data to enhance understanding of complex urban informal contexts  
 
It shows that in complex contexts s uch as urban informal settlements such local knowledge 
creation is valuable in achieving local contextual understanding, addressing the deficit in 
such understanding felt by organisations such as INGOs.  
 
Pragmatic organisational strategies to address structural data (in)justice  
 
It also highlights, given the challenges of structural data justice, the necessity to consider 
such activities within a wider framing which pragmatically considers organisational 
sustainability given the low value place d institutionally on local, situated knowledge.  
 
Further research  
 
As regards research the case suggests that the dynamics of data justice and injustice in local 
data gathering and application are of interest. The case tangentially mentioned another 
local data initiative in East Delhi based on a smartphone app. The expanding range of 
technologies able to support local data gathering, analysis and application should also be 
considered, situated within the nuanced understanding of structural data justice 
emph asised by the power/knowledge matrix. Finally the role of that model in enhancing the 
understanding of the structural data justice element of the data justice model may be 
considered, investigating whether it illuminates Heeks and Renken’s emphasis on the 
importance of structural data justice.

Abstract  
 
Cityscapes across the global South, following historical trends in the North, are increasingly 
being littered by closed -circuit television (CCTV) cameras. In this paper, we study the 
wholesale implementation of CCTV in New Delhi, a city no torious for incredibly high rates of 
crime against women. The push for CCTV, then, became one of many approaches explored 
by the state in making the city safer for women.  
 
In this paper, we deconstruct this narrative of greater surveillance equating to gre ater safety 
by using empirical evidence to understand the subjective experience of surveilling and being 
surveilled. By focussing on gender and utilising work from feminist thought, we find that the 
experience of surveillance is intersectionally mediated a long the axes of class and gender. 
The gaze of CCTV is cast upon those already marginalised to arrive at normative 
encumbrances placed by private, neoliberal interests on the urban public space. The 
politicisation of CCTV has happened in this context, and continues unabated in the absence 
of any concerted policy apparatus regulating it. We frame our findings utilising an analytical 
data justice framework put forth by Heeks and Shekhar (2019) . This  comprehensively sets 
out a social justice agenda that situat es CCTV within the socio -political contexts that are 
intertwined in the development and implementation of the technology itself.

 8A. Introduction  
 
The past decade has seen monumental growth in video -based surveillance systems across 
cities in the global South. Governments have invested in such systems for a variety of 
reasons, including anti -terrorism initiatives, general safety and security, and law and order 
(Firmino and Duarte, 2015). Surveillance of public spaces is also directed at providing 
security to women from harassment and violence, as can be seen in cities such as New Delhi 
that are grappling with high incidence of crime against women. Accordingly, the location for 
this research is New Delhi.  
 
Over the past decade, Delhi has developed a dense network of cameras. These are 
implemented and controlled by a complex network of both private and public actors, who 
share management, resources, and control over closed -circuit television (CCTV) spread 
throughout the city. Private actors controlling  the system include property -owning 
individuals, commercial establishments, and Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) and 
Market Welfare Associations (MWAs)54. Public stakeholders include the Delhi government, 
which is currently in the process of fulfilling  its election promise of providing each electoral 
constituency in the city with extensive CCTV coverage, the central government, the Delhi 
Police, the Public Works Department, the Delhi Metro Railway Corporation and three 
municipal corporations.  
 
This pape r contributes to the discussion on CCTV surveillance from the perspective of data 
justice, which assesses the ability of a data system to provide social justice to those it 
impacts. We interrogate the extent to which CCTV cameras support the achievement of  
justice, particularly from the perspective of women using public spaces. To do so, we adopt 
Heeks and Shekhar’s (2019) model of data justice which provides various dimensions to 
analyse datafication initiatives.  
 
We also borrow concepts from feminist surv eillance studies, which has been overtly political 
in critiquing the “heterosexual, heteronormative, and sexist male gaze” of surveillance of 
women and sexual minorities (Walby, 2005). In generating empirical evidence, we employ a 
feminist qualitative appr oach to question intersectional power dynamics and centre the 
embodiedness of data, safety, and privacy in the city. We align this with the framework of 
urban data justice to understand datafication as being embedded within the social contexts 
in which the  data systems are operationalised. Existing literature on feminist surveillance 
has underrepresented the experiences of women in the global South, while data justice has, 
so far, not directly engaged with feminist thought.  
 
One of the key research aims of the project, then, is to critically deconstruct this narrative of 
greater surveillance and visibility equating to greater safety by using empirical evidence to 
understand the subjective experience of being surveilled. This allows us to position CCTV 
camera s within the broader understanding of gendered access to geographical space as well 
as rights and justice systems. These feed into interrogating the extent to which CCTV in

governmental bodies that respectively represent the interests of residents or businesses operating out of 
particular residential or commercial areas.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88

 Delhi is designed to enable accomplishment of the stated objectives of safety to wo men, 
especially those from informal settlements.  
 
The paper is structured as follows. The first section provides a background of the existing 
literature that the study will draw upon or challenge, largely within the fields of urban data 
justice, surveillan ce studies, and feminist surveillance studies. After briefly discussing the 
methodology, the findings from the research are presented using the five dimensional 
analytical framework developed by Heeks and Shekhar (2019). Finally, we conclude with 
some furt her discussion, and propose recommendations and future research questions that 
arise out of the present study.  
 
 
8B. Background  
 
8B1. Feminist Surveillance Studies  
 
A crucial aspect of this paper is to advance an understanding of how, taken -for-granted as 
benign, surveillance technologies such as CCTV systems end up impacting already 
disenfranchised bodies. The dominant rationality of neutrality and objectivity that lend 
support to these technological tools could be borne out of histori cal inequalities, or morph 
and challenge them. For instance, Ruha Benjamin has shown that new technologies are 
often thrust upon populations that have historically had to resist their imposition (Benjamin, 
2016). Browne (2010, 2015) draws nuanced linkages between the historical modalities of 
policing slaves and contemporary technologies of surveillance such as biometrics. 
Questioning the supposed neutrality of these technologies allows for an exposition of the 
power relations that give rise to and govern th e use of these technologies.  
 
While not having been originally articulated in the context of ‘datafication’, a key theme 
utilised in feminist responses to surveillance borrows from feminist scholarship focusing on 
the intersectional, not additive, ways in which power differentials are wedded into the 
social relations of domination and resistance (Crenshaw, 1989). Using a critical 
intersectional feminist approach allows for the unravelling of “what constitutes surveillance, 
who is scrutinised, why and at wha t cost” (Dubrofsky and Magnet, 2015).  
 
Monahan's (2009) conceptualisation of the overlapping gendered dimensions of surveillance 
is a useful analytical framework to draw from as well. Monahan conceptualises technology 
to mediate the reproduction and reinfo rcement of unequal power structures through: (a) 
body discrimination i.e. by privileging a certain type of person and rendering others as 
deviant, (b) context or use discrimination by reproducing already unequal social structures, 
and (c) discrimination by  abstraction i.e. by the reduction to data points that facilitates the 
control from distance ( ibid. ). In other words, a feminist approach to surveillance allows for 
the interrogation of what the mythologies are that lend meaning to the technology in the 
first place.  
 
That being said, most studies assessing CCTV along the axis of gender indicate general 
support for CCTV among women as a measure of providing the experience of safety and Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
192 
 security (Koskela, 2002; Huey, 2010). This can be found in studies such as Hasija and  
Nagpal’s (2018), who in their survey of 250 young women in Delhi and their responses to 
CCTV found overwhelming support despite awareness of the risk of stalking and abuse and 
lack of clarity about the identity of the surveiller or objectives of surveilla nce.  
 
Previous research assessing CCTV surveillance from a feminist lens has also highlighted the 
impact of subjectivities and power relations on the experience of video -based and other 
surveillance systems. For instance, Wright et al. (2014), in their stu dy on video -based 
surveillance within apartment buildings in Toronto, found that women tended to identify as 
the objects of surveillance rather than agents conducting the surveillance, even in private 
settings where residents have a certain level of contro l over surveillant infrastructure. They 
further found that women were more likely to express trust in the surveillance system if 
their objectives aligned with that of the surveillant authority.  
 
8B2. Privacy and the Gaze through a Critical Feminist Lens  
 
In addition to state and private surveillance, feminist scholars have also had a long 
engagement with the subject of privacy and its relation to the male gaze, expanding on the 
notion of differentiated rights. Adler -Bell (2018) argues that for marginalised communities, 
privacy in the form of “ungoverned” spaces has been historically inaccessible. The Fourth 
Amendment in the United States, for instance, defines privacy spatially - the “reasonable 
expectation of privacy” is largely within the private space of the home ( ibid. ). This then 
implies that privacy as a right is contingent on property rights rather than being a universal 
right; something available only to those who can afford it. This leads to a stratified access to 
privacy, with groups living in infor mal settlements and the homeless having the least access 
to privacy (Gellman and Adler -Bell, 2017). One of the possible consequences of differential 
access to the right to privacy for different groups is the enforcement of normative 
boundaries in public sp aces.  
 
This is also reflected in jurisprudence around privacy in the United States, where the 
Supreme Court has ruled that citizens should not expect privacy in public spaces, as the 
constitution does not prevent people from spying on each other in public (Firmino and 
Duarte, 2014). The conception of the right to privacy as only available in private spaces is 
contingent on the historical dichotomy between the two (public and private) kinds of 
spaces, which has been amply critiqued by feminist scholars. They  critique the imposition of 
modesty and domestic isolation on middle and upper class women in India and other 
contexts as a result of the private/public divide, which has also led feminist writers to 
critique the notion of privacy itself (Allen, 2011). Fem inists argue that framing the discourse 
of privacy as protectionist, including in the context of video -based surveillance, does not 
align with a rights -based approach that would aim to increase decisional autonomy among 
women (Thomasen, 2018).  
 
In the cont ext of India, Phadke et al. (2011) argue that the threat posed by public spaces to 
‘respectable’ women is constructed within middle class discourse as arising from lower class 
or Muslim men. In a three year project on the use of urban public space in Mumba i, they 
find women internalised this discourse, identifying Muslim and lower class men as a source 
of anxiety and threat ( ibid. ). This then justifies placing the surveillant (protectionist) gaze on Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
193 
 middle class women and the surveillant (suspicious) gaze o n lower class men - mediating 
access to public space for both.  
 
Khan (2018) argues that in urban Pakistan, women are put under the surveillant gazes of 
men and the paternalistic state as they enter public spaces, with the attempt to provide 
women security by “inverting the male gaze onto itself”. This is a function of state 
surveillance also embodying characteristics of the male gaze, such that only particular types 
of “good women” are guaranteed protection - those who enter public space for legitimate 
purp oses and have a character deemed “worthy of protection” (Khan, 2018).  
 
However, rights -based framings of privacy have also been critiqued by feminists for starting 
from the perspective of an individualised subject with bargaining power (Allen, 2011). 
Indiv idualisation has the potential to invisibilise the web of power and social relations which 
mediate decision -making for women across the global South, including about their own 
bodies (Weinberg, 2017).  
 
Kovacs (2017), while critiquing surveillance through t he lens of gender, invokes Lyon (2003) 
in arguing for a shift from the individual rights -based framing of privacy to that of social 
justice, since surveillance is a “structural” rather than “individual” problem. This aligns well 
with the theorisation of da ta justice, the starting point for which is embedding data systems 
in their social context and web of power relations (Taylor, 2017).  
 
8B3. Data Justice  
 
Where the discourse around CCTV surveillance, as with other data -driven systems, has been 
framed aroun d tradeoffs between efficient security, privacy, and data protection (Dencik et 
al., 2016), data justice allows for factoring in the politics of data by squarely situatin g these 
data -driven systems within the social contexts in which they are embedded (Taylor, 2017).  
 
Recognising the shifts in the social contract that datafication is bringing about, Taylor (2017) 
utilises a ‘capabilities’ approach to bridge disparate conve rsations around data justice to 
carve out three pillars on which an international data justice approach could be premised: 
(in)visibility, (dis)engagement with technology and anti -discrimination. Taylor (2017) argues 
that these integrate the key negative a nd positive freedoms which are required by 
individuals for a fair engagement with data systems globally. For instance, along with the 
right to privacy, this would include the right to be represented, or to move out of the 
“surveillance gap” - which applies  to individuals or groups who are excluded from databases 
depriving them of critical rights ranging from citizenship to welfare benefits (Gilman and 
Green, 2018).  
 
Heeks and Shekhar (2019) provide an overarching analytical framework to think through the 
different dimensions of data justice. As mentioned earlier, we use their model to situate our 
case study of CCTV systems in Delhi. They define data justice as having five dimensions, 
relating to data flows and results of the data system. The first dimension,  that of procedural 
data justice, relates to the processes of data handling within the “information value chain”: 
the flow from data through information and decisions to actions and results. It indicates the 
level of inclusion across different points in th e value chain, upstream (relating to data and Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
194 
 information) and downstream (relating to decisions and actions), which in turn indicates the 
distribution of those contributing data and those who make decisions utilising that data. The 
second dimension relate s to instrumental data justice, or fairness in the results of the data 
system. Rights -based data justice relates to the enforcement of the negative and positive 
rights outlined by Taylor’s (2017) framework, including representation and anti -
discrimination.  Structural data justice pertains to the extent to which the ‘structure’, 
constituted by dominant actors and institutions, supports social justice in the functioning of 
data systems. Finally, distributive data justice encompasses all of the categories deta iled 
above, and relates to broader concerns of justice and equity (or lack thereof) that underpin 
data systems. Put simply, it is “the concern for who gets what as a result of data systems” 
(Heeks and Shekhar, 2019).  
 
8B4. Neoliberal Governance and Urban P lanning  
 
Data justice - particularly the structural dimension - concerns itself with the political 
economy of the data system, and the extent to which it is dictated by, or challenges, power 
differentials. Recent work has noted the increasing privatisation of public spaces, reflected 
in practices of neoliberal governance and the discourse around data -driven ‘smart cities’ 
(Firmino and Duarte, 2015; Coletta et al., 2018). A critical imperative within this discourse is 
projecting efficiency to at tract investment by global capital (Firmino and Duarte, 2015). 
Phadke et al. (2011) argue that this imperative inherently conflicts with the rights of 
marginalised groups to equally access public spaces, as they get sanitised and 
commercialised. They go so  far as to say that private spaces of consumption then 
“masquerade” as public spaces, welcoming only those with the “capacity to buy” ( ibid. ). 
 
This happens, in part, through privately funded surveillance systems that impose the 
normative boundaries on pub lic spaces, set by private actors. Fyfe (2004) characterises 
public -private partnerships in the United Kingdom as a way of “justifying private control 
over public spaces”. He argues that private surveillance excludes those individuals that are 
considered d eviant by the private actors that control the surveillance system ( ibid. ). 
Minnaar (2012), in an empirical study on growth of CCTV in South Africa, demonstrates that 
such growth can be mapped onto the parallel growth of gated neighbourhood enclosures. 
Gate d residential enclosures have also sprung up all over New Delhi, and have been illegally 
encroaching on public spaces through the city (Govindarajan, 2016). Video -based 
surveillance in semi -private spaces such as gated residential areas then distributes se curity 
unequally (Huey, 2010), and could even reinforce caste and class relations by policing 
workers (Alkazi, 2015).  
 
Firmino and Duarte (2015) further argue that the public -private model of CCTV systems 
leads to “scattered networks of technologies and pr actices”, as opposed to acting like a 
centralised control system as has been projected in the discourse of urban planning. These 
are then understood to be locally contextualised and mediated, rather than entirely top -
down systems with perfect command -and-control centres. Despite such fragmentation, it 
has been argued that constant awareness as a risk management strategy has become an 
integral identifier of contemporary societies (Giddens, 1990; Beck, 1992). As video -based 
surveillance systems move towards g reater integration, penology moves away from 
problem diagnosis towards risk management ( ibid. ). An “actuarial” approach to managing Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
195 
 criminal activity at the aggregated level of entire populations is then seen to be taking hold 
(McCahill, 2002).  
 
 
8C. Metho dology  
 
The study takes a feminist approach to qualitative methods. Drawing on Wickramas inghe’s 
(2009) conception of feminist epistemology of knowledge in the global South, we conducted 
semi -structured, in -depth interviews to bring out lived experiences of  surveillance among 
different stakeholders, with a focus on women living in informal settlements in Delhi. Other 
stakeholders were interviewed to surface the social relations in which the surveillance 
system is embedded. We interviewed six categories of st akeholders, listed in Table 1. 
Interviews also allowed us to glean perspectives of different stakeholders to interrogate 
dominant, alternative, and counter narratives around video -based surveillance and privacy, 
and integrate these into a theoretical frame work of urban data justice.  
 
We employed purposive sampling, aiming to gather perspectives from across key 
stakeholders engaged in and affected by video -based surveillance of public spaces in New 
Delhi. We employed the snowballing technique within purposiv e sampling for law 
enforcement and government officials, and attempted to diversify civilian respondents by 
class.  
 
In addition to the interviews, some observational and anecdotal evidence was also collected 
during the course of the fieldwork, by observing  meetings between stakeholders. Finally, we 
also sent in Right to Information requests to the Delhi Police inquiring about budgetary 
allocations to cameras and drones under programmes that aim to ensure safety for women.

 8D. Findings  
 
8D1. Procedural Data Justice  
 
Fragmentation and function creep  
 
Several differing motivations and functions behind investment into video -based surveillance 
by the police and state emerged during the course of our research. This has implications for 
the manner in which data flows are structured and data handling processes are designed. 
While it is unclear precise ly when and what the motivations were behind the initial uptake 
of CCTV installation in Delhi, one of our respondents from law enforcement suggested that 
initial installations were rolled out in the course of preparations for New Delhi hosting the 
2010 Com monwealth Games.55 This is in consonance with other efforts to commercialise 
the city and make it appear worthy of investment including slum demolition and the growth 
of surveillance systems with commercial interests (something seen in other cities in the 
global South (Minnaar, 2012)).  
 
The well -publicised push for CCTV installation in Delhi commenced as a response to the 
country -wide protests following the multi -perpetrator rape of a young female in New Delhi 
in 2012. A sizeable corpus of INR 6.6 billion ( c.USD 96.5 million) earmarked for this purpose - 
the Nirbhaya Fund - was set up by the central government in the immediate aftermath of 
the rape. The installation of CCTV formed a part of technological solutions that were to play 
a key role in making citie s safer for women (Ministry of Women and Child Development, 
n.d.). From 2010 until February 2018, about 5,000 CCTV cameras were installed by the Delhi 
Police. However, as indicated by the responses to our Right to Information application to 
the Delhi Polic e, none of them have been installed under the Nirbhaya Fund. Moreover, an 
interview with an official of the nodal ministry for the corpus indicated that the ministry’s 
outlook now was that CCTV systems are not to be funded out of the corpus as they were 
ineffective in enhancing safety - at least in the ministry’s articulation of safety - and were 
more effective for the purposes of investigation.  
 
What has also emerged is a fragmented yet organised matrix of CCTV systems used to 
surveil over public spaces an d perform undefined roles, as theorised by Firmino and Duarte 
(2015) previously. This then leads to the utilisation of CCTV for purposes that are 
determined on an ad hoc  needs basis. For instance, while CCTV systems have been installed 
primarily to increas e safety for women in public spaces, the police unit that is specifically 
designed to address crimes relating to women and children had no role to play in the 
implementation or monitoring of such systems. In a similar vein, the implementation of 
CCTV camer as by the metro corporation was initially meant to aid in operational and crowd 
control objectives, and the utilisation of CCTV cameras for security purposes then became a 
by-product. Meanwhile, the objectives behind installation of a CCTV camera system by  the 
municipal council in its jurisdiction was intended for maintenance of public order, not 
criminal activity as such.  
 
 
55 The respondent also suggested that most of the cameras installed back in 2010 while preparing for the 
Commonwealth Games are probably dysfunctional now and need to be replaced.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
197 
 Another way in which contradicting purposes behind CCTV installations emerge is by 
observing the provisioning of signage, if any, desig ned to indicate ongoing surveillance. 
Simply put, law enforcement officials described two aims behind placing visible signage 
accompanying CCTV cameras, (a) crime deterrence, and (b) making those under the 
camera’s gaze feel safer by knowing they are being  watched. On the other hand, covert 
surveillance, i.e. CCTV installations without any indication of such installation, aims to watch 
without the knowledge of the person being watched, which then has detection of crime as 
its primary motive. The two sets of  objectives come into conflict, and are often adopted on 
an ad hoc  basis.  
 
For example, in a busy marketplace in Delhi, widespread CCTV installations by the MWA in 
this public spot were accompanied by regular announcements on the public address system 
informing those in the marketplace of being under surveillance. A law enforcement official 
posted at the marketplace, then, also indicated that CCTV cameras were intended to deter 
crime and for post -facto investigation. Within the same marketplace, however, se veral 
commercial establishments that we spoke to indicated that while they had initially installed 
cameras as an “insurance” against crime, a key purpose that they served now was to 
monitor stock as well as employees - or managerial surveillance, in other words. These 
commercial establishments either did not have any signage or the few that did opined that 
the signage was a relic from when they had initially installed the cameras, and that it served 
“no real purpose”. For the commercial establishments espec ially, the symbolic deterrent 
effec t of CCTV cameras (Hempel and T öpfer, 2004), then, is significantly diluted owing to an 
array of reasons: irregular monitoring, informational overkill, and the inertia within law 
enforcement.  
 
The selective use of signage could additionally contribute to an information asymmetry 
between the implementers of CCTV cameras and those being surveilled. This argument is 
substantiated further in the next subsection.  
 
Access to information  
 
We found that a number of women we re unaware of the existence of cameras installed or 
governed by law enforcement, except in places where cameras are very visible, such as in 
metro stations. A few interviewees expressed discomfort with the topic of conversation due 
to their perception of l ow levels of knowledge regarding CCTV cameras, and some women 
who were approached even refused to interview, citing their lack of any knowledge. None of 
the interviewees were aware of the extent or locations of camera coverage, the identity of 
surveilling authorities, or the demarcation between private and public systems - even if they 
were aware of the general existence of CCTV cameras. This information asymmetry was 
explicitly endorsed by some of our respondents within the Delhi Police, as they understood  
the purpose of CCTV surveillance to primarily be of crime detection. This, according to them, 
then mandates the least level of information dispersion, as surveillance was understood to 
be a covert activity to be performed without the knowledge of the watc hed.  
 
In most cases, however, this did not erode trust in the system, as the general awareness of 
cameras operated by law enforcement made women feel safer, especially in isolated areas. 
This is in contrast to Koskela’s (2002) interviewees, whose trust in the system was Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
198 
 significantly eroded by lack of knowledge regarding the identity and location of the 
surveillers. This could partly be attributed to the perceived lack of capacity and 
approachability of, and therefore trust in, the Delhi Police. Women acros s locations and 
classes, with a few exceptions, expressed the inadequacy of the Delhi Police in responding 
to crimes against women. By and large, women who expressed distrust in the police also 
expressed increased trust in technological systems, perceiving  them as unbiased and 
dispassionate observers.  
 
To regulate or not to regulate  
 
Delhi’s CCTV project has stemmed from a drive towards crime control that is governed 
through coalitions between locally situated police, retailers, private citizenry and hyper -local 
governing institutions. What is emergent then is “scattered networks” (Firmino and Duarte, 
2015). This has significant repercussions for the manner in which data is handled and the 
kinds of voices that become dominant in decision -making processes. Ov er the last 2 years, 
there have been calls from voices, albeit solitary, within the state machinery to have 
standard operating procedures in place that govern the installation of CCTV cameras 
(Barman, 2018). In the absence of any governing legislation spea king to the installation of 
CCTV cameras specifically, or data protection broadly, untethered power is being granted to 
both state and non -state actors without any accountability mechanism in place.  
 
It was in this backdrop that a draft version of the “Del hi Rules for Regulation of CCTV 
Camera Systems in NCT [ National Capital Territory ] of Delhi, 2018” (CCTV Rules hereafter) 
were released. While the CCTV Rules still do not have the force of law, members of one 
RWA that we interviewed stated that the CCTV Ru les make the CCTV installations legal and 
are being utilised to support further installation drives. The CCTV Rules seek to regulate the 
installation and use of CCTV cameras in public spaces in Delhi. The CCTV Rules do have some 
useful stipulations, such a s somewhat limiting the purposes for which the information 
recorded is used, mandating signage indicating ongoing surveillance, and also on the 
utilisation of open technical standards. However, they fall short on several counts. For one, 
they treat the inf ormation recorded as belonging to the owner of the system with the right 
to access the information provided only to “authorised persons”. It is unclear who such 
authorised persons are. Further, they pay performative obeisance to incorporating privacy 
prote ctions when they state that “the camera shall be located at such place so that it shall 
not collect information which invades the privacy of an individual” (Government of Delhi, 
2018). These stipulations read together encode an understanding of privacy as a condition 
that individuals occupying public spaces do not have a claim to. It is evident that a primary 
objective here is of according significantly enhanced law enforcement control to, knowledge 
of, and access to all CCTV installations “collecting infor mation from a public space” ( ibid. ). 
 
8D2. Instrumental Data Justice  
 
Security for whom?  
 
The Delhi Police had installed 5,000 cameras across the city as of February 2018. A majority 
of its network comes from a public -private model of collaboration, called the ‘Nigehbaan’ 
scheme. This allows the Delhi Police to access another 175,000 cameras ac ross the city. This Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
199 
 network includes cameras installed by private individuals or groups, including individual 
residents, businesses, wealthier RWAs and MWAs. An overwhelming majority of CCTV 
cameras in Delhi are thus implemented and controlled by private s takeholders. As has been 
pointed out in other cities across the global North and South, the privatisation of security in 
public spaces inevitably results in unequal access to security for different groups (Huey, 
2010). This also brings into question data o wnership, as it is very likely that the individuals 
being recorded would not even have ready access to the footage, or any procedures in place 
in order to do so.  
 
Access to public space itself becomes unequal, as privately funded security systems privilege  
the interests of the landed class or those with commercial capital and discriminate against 
lower caste and class groups entering those spaces (Alkazi, 2015). The interests of those 
who own surveillance systems often come into conflict with interests of t hose without 
access to resources and capital to perform surveillance - posing challenges to rights to 
access and ownership of data and data systems. This surveillance system can then be seen 
as a concrete reproduction of the ‘suspicious gaze’, extending he re to all workers entering 
gated residential areas and other privately surveilled public spaces (Phadke et al., 2011).  
 
Such conflicts emerged during a meeting we observed between residents of a gated 
residential area with local police officials in the sou th of New Delhi. Residents raised several 
questions demanding the implementation of CCTV, which they were told has been taken 
care of by the RWA. Law enforcement and residents then discussed security issues in the 
area, largely seen as arising from the ent ry of workers such as private security personnel, 
cab drivers and domestic workers within the gated community. Both residents and law 
enforcement discursively positioned workers as potential criminals to be controlled through 
surveillance systems. It is in  such a context that CCTV systems are being introduced into the 
gated area, including those being funded by the Delhi government. The privatisation of data 
and data systems then inevitably creates the conditions for distributive injustice, as data is 
extra cted from lower class workers and benefits accrue to upper or middle class employers.  
 
Simultaneously, we found that poorer sections of the urban landscape, such as slum camps - 
even those that are legally recognised by the state - were found to be existin g in the 
surveillance gap (Gilman and Green, 2018). With no CCTV installations provided either by 
law enforcement or the state, these areas were curiously outside of the growing 
ubiquitousness of CCTV -based surveillance systems. This was consistent with th e non -
recognition of their requirement for basic amenities such as water drainage and pothole -
free lanes. Contrast this with the experience of affluent gated communities where not only 
is there a web of privately installed CCTV cameras, but also funding an d infrastructural 
support by the state for further installations. This leads to the structural invisibilisation of 
vulnerable groups with very little political voice.  
 
Akin to how surveillance is utilised to reproduce power dynamics, the surveillance gap c an 
be similarly utilised as a tool to exert social control ( ibid. ). While the “gap” is not something 
that is de facto intended to be bridged, our respondents expressed a strong preference for 
the installation of at least some CCTV cameras at the entry and exit points as a crime -
deterrent tool in the absence of a responsive and approachable law enforcement 
mechanism. This lends further credence to the feminist understanding of privacy as having a Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88

 deeply contextual meaning, instead of implying the complete re jection of surveillance 
systems.  
 
Conflicting expectations and objectives  
 
This section deals with conflicting expectations within women respondents and law 
enforcement, which indicate different results of surveillance for different groups.  
There emerged s everal fault lines, along the lines of caste, region, and class, within women 
respondents using public spaces. A small subset of women respondents, largely those who 
identified as middle class, advocated for CCTV cameras covering residential areas in which  
they lived. They expressed the need to monitor entry and exit points into gated residential 
spaces, and to regulate the movement of outsiders into what were perceived as private 
zones. These outsiders mostly constituted other marginalised groups, includin g working 
class men, male migrant workers from other states or neighbouring countries, and sex 
workers. This corroborates Phadke et al.’s (2011) conception of the dominant narrative of 
working class men being constructed as one of the primary threats to mi ddle class women 
as they use public spaces, justifying the use of surveillance mechanisms to police both 
groups. Further, as corroborated by Wright et al. (2014), groups such as sex workers and 
beggars are at greater risk of persecution as they regularly p erform solicitation on the street 
which either (a) heightens visibility in public spaces or (b) is criminalised when performed in 
public.  
 
Fault lines between the objectives of civilian women respondents and surveilling authorities 
also emerged in several cases. Most women respondents argued that CCTV fulfilled either or 
both of two purposes – prevention and investigation. However, all our interviews with law 
enforcement indicated that there is little to no crime prevention, including sexual 
harassment and violence, that they have experienced or expect to experience in the future - 
at least while systems continue to be fragmented. In addition, women respondents also 
expected constant real -time monitoring in places where cameras had been installed, which 
is not the case across state and privately controlled systems. The perceived trade off being 
made by respondents between security and privacy in urban public spaces is then made in 
the context of limited information dispersion. This then leads to expectations of constant 
surveillance from a system that is excessively fragmented.  
 
Fault lines were also found in specific use cases. We found that tracking missing persons is a 
regular function of the Delhi Metro surveillance system, which includes women or men who 
have run away from home. Maintaining the autonomy of the “missing persons” then lies at 
the discretion of the officers handling their case – as one respondent told us, they don’t do 
anything “unethical” and therefore turn back husbands who are stalking the ir wives, but do 
help with cases of runaway persons whose parents report them as missing. That these fault 
lines appear along the axis of gender very frequently can also be found in other cases - such 
as in Orissa, when a camera that was installed to prote ct women against violence had to be 
removed after protests from women who did not want to be watched while bathing (PTI, 
2012). These cases illustrate that the objectives and zones of protection determined by 
those in authority and those of the beneficiari es do not always overlap.  
 Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
201 
 The conflicts then bring out contradictions in surveillance systems that are aimed at both 
control and care, demanding the balancing of the right to privacy against physical security 
(Taylor, 2017). Wright et al. (2014) describe this conflict as the extent to which “visibility 
threatens or provides safety”. Reading the concept of the male gaze along with Monahan’s 
(2009) understanding of context/use discrimination is relevant here. Read together, they 
speak to the masculinised and  distanced monitoring of the feminine body and feminised 
spaces. As Monahan ( ibid. ) argues, “when social contexts are already marked by sexist 
relations, then surveillance (and other) technologies tend to amplify those tensions and 
inequalities”. The case of the surveillant gaze and the voyeuristic gaze are, in this case, 
overlapping to disadvantage either particular groups across contexts (couples getting 
intimate), or all women in a particular zone of surveillance (on the beaches of Puri). The 
latter can be addressed through the principle of engagement with technology ( ibid. ) within 
the principles of data justice, which enables selective use of technology, and could then be 
mobilised to reject surveillance in certain public zones.  
 
8D3. Rights -Based Data J ustice  
 
Privacy and the surveillant male gaze  
 
We found women respondents prioritising the right to be represented in video -based 
surveillance systems over their right to privacy, displaying very high levels of support for 
CCTV systems. This then implies that the CCTV system in the city provides rights -based data 
justice, in the trade -off between security and privacy. As in Hasija and Nagpal’s (2018) study, 
women overwhelmingly chose the right to be represented in the surveillance systems with 
the perceived benefit of security.  Unlike Hasija and Nagpal’s study however, we did not find 
evidence of women feeling at risk of stalking or violations of privacy. We further found that 
respondents who supported video -based surveillance also felt that curren t levels of 
coverage in the city were low, advocating for further coverage of isolated or lonely roads in 
particular.  
 
Respondents across the various stakeholders we interviewed indicated their understanding 
of privacy as confined to private spaces, which were amorphously defined. Individual police 
officials define the private zone based on their subjective understandings of privacy. One of 
our respondents from the Delhi Police, for instance, conceptualised private zones as any 
area inside one’s home that i s not visible from the street. It then appears that being 
constantly monitored and recorded is inevitable for those who do not have access to private 
property, limiting rights to disengage with technology. It was striking that it was only in the 
context in  which privacy in public spaces was brought up by a law enforcement official in 
our interviews was when referring to areas that house senior government officials and those 
with political power, described as “VIPs”. A senior Delhi Police official revealed t hat the 
provision of safety to VIPs could even be through the temporary installation of cameras on 
routes being used by such persons, which are then removed to protect the privacy of 
permanent residents in these areas which typically house a host of high -level politicians and 
government officials. The right to disengage from surveillance systems, a critical data right 
(Taylor, 2017), was only  accessible to publicly elected officials and government officials at 
the very top of the hierarchy.  
 Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
202 
 Women using pub lic spaces affirmed the dominant discourse of privacy and public spaces 
being in completely separate domains, with privacy only to be sought and protected in the 
spatial understanding of the private domain. The lack of a conception of privacy in public 
spaces reiterates the gradations in access to the right to privacy outlined by feminists, 
through its contingency on a strict dichotomy between private and public spaces (Allen, 
2011; Adler -Bell, 2018). The publicness of a space then justified, and even deman ded, the 
presence of the surveillant gaze of law enforcement. The gaze is then aimed at sanitising 
public spaces of potentially dangerous elements, who could cause disruption to public order 
(Walby, 2005).  
 
When asked whether they considered the leaking of  footage of couples getting intimate in 
metro trains as a harm of CCTV -based surveillance, most women civilian respondents, with 
the exception of two, did not perceive this to be a privacy violation and blamed the couples 
for getting intimate in a public s pace. In a similar vein, Phadke et al. (2011) finds in her study 
that the discourse of privacy has been used to persecute couples for acts such as holding 
hands in public spaces, through the discourse of obscenity. Obscenity then overwhelms the 
privacy vio lation in the public imagination, with several respondents arguing that being 
intimate in a public space such as a metro, which has families and children, is against 
cultural norms of propriety in public spaces. This also points to the notion that expectat ions 
of privacy are hyperlocal and specific to the norms of a particular space.  
 
Video surveillance in this case is used to enforce cultural behavioural norms by punishing 
deviance with not only the violation of privacy, but the removal of the expectation of 
privacy at all. This manifestation of privacy is very similar to Allen’s (2011) notion of 
unpopular privacy - as an argument against autonomy.  
 
Contrary to this, two women raised distinct objections to the leaking of footage of couples 
on the metro. One  argued that such incidents are “disgusting” and “amount to the misuse of 
the public”, particularly because the official monitoring the footage is “watching porn and 
gaining entertainment...they make a video of it and upload”. The respondent raises a 
speci fic concern about the voyeuristic gaze of the surveillant authority, which brings 
disproportionate attention on women in public - including particular categories of 
vulnerability such as “breastfeeding women”.  
 
The second argument against data leaks, made by a respondent who described herself as 
being a recent entrant into public spaces without male companionship, supported increased 
protections against leakage “especially because people don’t have knowledge of these 
things, and are very often not educated or aware”. Lack of awareness could stem from poor 
access to information, barriers such as signs indicating the presence of cameras being in an 
unfamiliar language, or general unfamiliarity with public spaces due to barriers to access. It 
can be seen that c ategories such as women with unequal access to public space, 
undereducated groups, and migrants then simultaneously face higher risks of privacy 
violation (Adler -Bell, 2018) and/or have fewer resources or awareness to deal with such 
violation. This could t hen pose a threat to rights -based data justice as certain groups are 
overrepresented in the leaked data, and procedural data justice, as those groups are left out 
of the value -chain of information flows.

203 
 Criminalisation and the panoptic gaze  
 
In our inter views with Delhi Police in Central Delhi, the part of the city with the maximum 
concentration of government offices and other state agencies, and also therefore of public 
demonstrations, we found protest gatherings to be one of the key sites of surveillanc e. 
Officials from control rooms that perform the surveillance revealed that some of the fish -
eye cameras have been recently acquired and are only deployed in key locations - which 
includes the locations where political protests and public demonstrations ar e organised. The 
heightened surveillance at sites of public demonstrations are in a context where protesters 
can be detained or arrested for performing demonstrations as it constitutes a breach of 
public order, among other concerns (Delhi Police, 2019). Ta rgeted surveillance at sites that 
have been demarcated for public demonstrations by law enforcement are an additional 
measure of control, in addition to prior permissions from law enforcement to stage such 
demonstrations. Taken together with instances of i llegal detention, heightened surveillance 
adds to a context of constraints placed upon the right to freedom of assembly in the city.  
 
This can be seen as an instance of a larger shift in how risk assessment and criminalisation is 
increasingly being thought  of by law enforcement, with the imagination of heightened 
surveillance technology. Respondents involved in the implementation of CCTV systems 
expressed intentions to integrate other technologies in the ‘ideal’ security solution. 
Technologies such as facia l recognition and video analytics were frequently suggested. One 
proposed implementation of facial recognition was of metro users at station entry and exit 
points. Among other functions, this could be used to expedite entry and exit from metro 
stations of certain categories of individuals such as government employees. The data of 
these individuals would be stored in a database against which the facial recognition 
software would cross -check the legitimacy of those seeking to enter or exit through this 
system . Another proposed implementation was for images of ‘suspects’ at metro stations to 
be searched in real -time against a database that already had stored images. Such 
‘searchability’ in CCTV footage is also being desired nationally (NCRB, n.d.). 
 
What these imaginations bring forth is the objective of CCTV -based systems to provide more 
than the raw data observed, and move towards the actuarial approach to crime 
management (McCahill, 2002). If implemented, these will have a profound impact on how 
CCTV systems are utilised, given that the data justice implications of these newer 
technologies such as facial recognition and artificial intelligence are only just starting to be 
understood by civil society. CCTV in and of itself, then, is also seen as a weak surveill ance 
tool, whose integration with computer -based systems with sophisticated data processing 
power is crucial to then exercise more intensive surveillance (Lyon, 2001).  
 
8D4. Structural Data Justice  
 
“At least then they will believe us”  
 
Most participants f rom lower socioeconomic backgrounds had direct or secondary 
experiences of the Delhi Police as unresponsive to their needs or even violent. Poor women 
expressed very low levels of trust, with statements such as “the police is not meant for poor 
people, it is only meant for the rich”. Several instances of such unresponsiveness were Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
204 
 detailed through interviews, including cases where the police took a response time of 
several days, delayed investigations, or even refused to investigate. One group of 
participan ts, selling goods close to a busy thoroughfare in Central Delhi, spoke about 
routinely facing violence from the police, and regularly getting taken to police stations for 
thefts that they did not commit. They believed themselves to be easy scapegoats durin g 
police investigations, due to their constant physical presence in public areas. Poor women 
felt a fear of unresponsiveness or violence in their interactions with law enforcement, in 
addition to their fear of harassment or violence from men in public spac es. They partly 
ascribed their persecution by law enforcement to their constant presence in public spaces, 
as they operated in public every day to earn their livelihoods.  
 
Due to the historical experience of suspicion that the police displayed towards them, they 
felt that cameras in public spaces would allow them to provide incontrovertible evidence of 
either cases where they were complainants, or prove their innocence in cases where they 
have been falsely accused. One group of women also expres sed that it might help them to 
carry investigations through, as the police personnel usually take four to five days to 
respond to complaints by which time witnesses may no longer be available. In all of these 
instances, the presence of a camera could provi de or improve access to justice and legal 
recourse for citizens and communities who currently feel excluded from such systems.  
 
However, several participants challenged this reading of the camera, and reiterated that it is 
merely an object embedded in the social context, rather than a free floating tool to be used 
for the benefit of the aggrieved. They were thus sceptical of the extent to which CCTV could 
enhance access to justice, without responsive officers carrying out investigations on the 
basis of that  footage. This indicates that increased access to legal redressal through video 
surveillance is contingent on rights -based justice within broader social structures - it is 
critical for citizens to have access to legal systems and data flows for this potent ial to 
materialise.  
 
Turning the gaze inwards  
 
Several respondents from among law enforcement and government officials spoke about 
initiatives to provide CCTV coverage to public offices, such as police stations, civil servants’ 
offices, and Public Works De partment’s offices. This is following a Supreme Court order in 
2014 to install CCTV across police stations in the city, and has been explicitly identified as a 
move to prevent violence against women in police stations (Express News Service, 2019).  
 
Three o bjectives emerged behind the coverage of police stations and other government 
offices in our interviews with law enforcement and government officials. One, providing 
officials protection from false complaints. In particular, police officials spoke about 
protecting themselves against false allegations of violence, while government officials spoke 
about false allegations of committing atrocities against Scheduled Castes and Tribes, or of 
sexual harassment in case of male officers. Two, increasing accountabili ty to the public, by 
treating government offices as public spaces to be monitored and held accountable to 
citizens. Three, managerial surveillance, with monitoring of their own stations as well as 
through centralised monitoring of several stations in one c ontrol room. Each of these 
objectives could potentially contribute towards making policing systems and government Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
205 
 functioning more transparent and accountable to citizens, as their actions are made visible 
to the public and to each other. This requires gre ater emphasis on procedural aspects of 
data flows, with the inclusion of police officials upstream, and the inclusion of citizens 
downstream in the information value chain.  
 
The configuration of the infrastructure of the monitoring system determines its co ntribution 
towards enabling accountability and transparency and ultimately, structural justice in the 
results of surveillance systems. In police stations, screens could either be placed in public 
areas such as reception rooms and/or in the offices of senio r officials. We found some 
stations where screens were monitored and controlled only by senior officials, which could 
exacerbate power inequalities. During a field visit, for instance, we found that public 
demonstrators were told by beat officers that they  would have to appear harsh in their 
behaviour since they were under surveillance from another station. On the other hand, a 
senior bureaucrat said that she uses CCTV cameras to ensure that each officer across 
departments is treating visitors properly. CCT V could then act as a tool to alleviate power 
inequalities between citizens and government and law enforcement, by making each 
stakeholder visible to the other. This is not the case in monitoring systems that prioritise 
upstream data  flows (from citizens to state) over downstream ones (from state to citizens), 
posing barriers to data -just systems (Heeks and Shekhar, 2019).  
 
 
8E. Discussion and Conclusions  
 
The design of contemporary urban spaces has been dominated by increasing concerns 
around securitisati on. Achieving and maintaining these imaginations requires the reinforcing 
of implicit hierarchies, and by extension, exclusions, in public space. One way in which these 
have manifested is through geo -spatial segregations that are privately controlled. Inde ed, 
the idea of the public itself has been constructed to value some social groups over others, 
with access to public space being made differentially available. That the urban public space 
itself is the medium as well as the outcome of social practices is abundantly clear. Exclusion 
and intolerance, and their conflation with safety and security, get negotiated and co -
produced with others occupying the public space.  
 
CCTV systems have proliferated remarkably in Delhi in the last few years, and continue to 
grow at remarkable levels even as this paper is being published. While there is a care motif 
at play here, it also showcases how disciplining functions co -evolve (see Lyon, 1994). Our 
findings indicate that the panoptic gaze is not a homogenous power exercis ed only by the 
surveiller, but is multifarious and intermingling. For example, one finding in this research is 
that the gaze of the panopticon is turned on itself, as both public servants and the public are 
both now within the gaze.  
 
The disciplining power  of the gaze also manifests in the internalisation of modesty ideals by 
women themselves, as women respondents in our street interviews indicated having 
internalised the absence of rights such as privacy that may be reasonably afforded in public 
spaces. Th e equating of increasing CCTV with increasing women’s safety then indicates a 
contradiction in the shifting of the gender ideologies in public spaces, with women now 
required to be making themselves hypervisible in exchange for security guarantees from the  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
206 
 masculinised state. Visibility, then, is made to be a prerequisite to security. Moreover, 
women respondents in the study invariably identified as objects of surveillance rather than 
subjects, consistent with research on CCTV surveillance elsewhere (Wright  et al., 2014). This 
is reflected in the lack of female representation among those planning and executing 
surveillance systems, even among those designed specifically to combat violence against 
women.  
 
8E1. Conclusions  
 
The theoretical focus of work on CCT V systems has focussed on it at a post -installation 
stage, on its operation. Such a view leads to the dehumanising of video -based surveillance 
whereas the material realities unsurprisingly indicate the centrality of human engagement 
at every stage of imple mentation and operation. Re -centring the ‘human element’ allows 
for work around data justice to understand technological developments in light of larger, 
historical forms of structural and institutional oppression. We utilise this framework, 
particularly t he model of data justice developed by Heeks and Shekhar (2019), to study the 
implementation of CCTV systems in New Delhi and the social context in which those systems 
are embedded. Further, explicitly attending to questions around gender, while incorporati ng 
methodological and epistemic innovations put forth in feminist thought, allows for the 
exposition of a social justice agenda. In doing so, we were able to centre the power 
relationships that underpin surveillance.  
 
Within the dimension of procedural dat a justice, or justice in handling data systems, we 
interrogated the motivations and interests of those who control CCTV systems in Delhi. We 
found objectives devised by civilians, the state, and law enforcement to be mutable, and at 
times contradictory. Th e provision of signage, or lack thereof, was found to be indicative of 
different theories of change behind CCTV installation. Responses addressing the uses of 
CCTV were usually wide ranging: pre -emptive behavioural change, and/or post -facto 
evidence of cri me, and/or performative security. The objective for the state, at times, was 
to protect commercial interests, also at odds with the propagated public narrative that 
makes CCTV crucial in enhancing women’s safety in public spaces. This could arise from the 
lack of representation of marginalised interests at the procedural stage of the system, with 
implementation being largely controlled by private actors, law enforcement, or the state.  
 
Results of the system, or instrumental data justice, were found to be critically dependent on 
the harms or benefits of visibility to the state. Thus, while most middle class women 
supported CCTV systems for enhancing their safety, most women from informal settlements 
found it useful to prove their innocence in cases of false  accusations or when officials 
refused to believe their complaints. Women performing activities in public spaces that 
heightened visibility while also inviting public censure or disrupting public order, such as sex 
workers, were found to be accruing the ha rms of the voyeuristic and controlling gaze of the 
state and others using public spaces.  
 
Within the dimension of rights -based data justice, a key right that we focus on is that of 
privacy within public spaces. Our findings indicate a deeply contextual art iculation of 
privacy. Inherent in the articulation is an internalisation of a strict separation between what 
constitutes a public or private space with privacy only to be expected in the latter. This, Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
207 
 along with belief in the efficacy of CCTV in aiding gre ater security and safety, also provides 
the fuel for the articulation of greater CCTV coverage by the supposed beneficiaries of CCTV 
installation. However, contradictions emerge as this trade -off between privacy and security 
is made in an information -scarc e environment, often intentionally designed as such by 
surveillers. The other key right we assessed was the right to be represented, which was 
unfulfilled for Informal settlements as they were found to be in the ‘surveillance gap’ 
despite wanting CCTV syst ems to deal with unresponsive law enforcement officials.  
 
Finally, structural data justice, or the extent to which powerful institutions and individuals 
support the interests of equality and justice within data systems. We found that regardless 
of objectiv es and expectations of different stakeholders, the actual usage of CCTV systems is 
hyperlocal and determined by power relations, social norms, and institutional structures in 
the particular space in which it operates. This is also applicable to CCTV camera s that are 
placed upon law enforcement and government officials, which aim at turning the gaze of 
the state onto itself but can only succeed in doing so if upstream and downstream data 
flows are given equal attention.  
 
8E2. Recommendations  
 
Given the multi plicity of actors that are engaged in the unrolling of Delhi’s CCTVisation, as 
well as the breadth of intended beneficiaries, several conflicts emerge in how these systems 
are designed, who they are designed for, and what benefits and harms subsequently 
emerge. Such conflicts can be addressed through wide public consultations with different 
stakeholders, including non -governmental and civil society organisations working on 
women’s rights, gender, urban planning, and the right to privacy, in addition to RWAs  and 
MWAs (Goswami, 2018).  
 
A recommendation that holds true for all datafication programmes in India that are at 
various stages of implementation is for the crafting of policy that ensures robust 
transparency and accountability measures are institutionali sed. This is especially critical in 
the absence of any comprehensive data protection law. At the same time, there is a dire 
need for processes that mandate mechanisms of appraisal regarding the utility and 
subsequent appraisal of these datafication initiat ives. This is glaring in the present case of 
CCTV, where it is effectively the mythology of the technology that is garnering the political 
support for increased demarcation of public funds towards the CCTV project.  
 
The lack of any concerted approach towar ds the roll out of the CCTV programme has also 
led to potentially debilitating consequences owing to the ad hoc  determination of use -cases 
by departments within government and law enforcement tasked with the mandate to 
implement CCTV. The case of the polic e unit that has been carved out to address crimes 
relating to women and children having no engagement with CCTV is telling. This is especially 
curious given the equating of more CCTV with enhanced women’s safety, as well as a 
scenario where uptake of CCTV is being ensured in every police station in the city. Whether 
any internal processes govern this inter -departmental work allocation vis -a-vis CCTV is 
unclear, and in any case, opaque.

208 
 Future research agenda  
 
An immediate research agenda is to better under stand the implications of the ‘newer’ 
technologies creating big data systems such as facial recognition software and artificial 
intelligence applications for which use -cases are being cultivated in datafication 
programmes being spearheaded by the state. Th e political economy around these moves is 
as yet understudied, and urgent work is required to pre -empt some of the distinct ways in 
which the governance of society and the data justice potential of systems could be 
impacted. As these make their way into th e delivery of welfare systems in the global South, 
what datafication programmes entail for contemporary understandings of the social 
contract, participation in a democratic society and for citizenship itself are more overarching 
questions that require urge nt addressing.  
 
Any data justice project explicitly occupies the realm of governance, making it a worthwhile 
bridge to inform any such project through disciplines that do not occupy the space. While 
this case study was one such attempt at doing  feminist su rveillance studies, a data justice 
project could, in some sense, bring together any disciplines more occupied with critical 
approaches such as urban studies, critical data studies and surveillance studies.

Abstract  
 
Non -governmental organizations (NGOs) have become important curators of data from 
informal urban settlements. Given the absence of these communities  in public datasets, 
they work to take informal settlements from a state of invisibility and injustice to on e of 
visibility and justice, in and through data. The working premise of these NGOs is that by 
producing data about informal settlements, data can act as a “currency” through which 
individuals can access different forms of justice. However, the literature that studies 
datafication in marginalized urban communities shows this is not always the case. Data 
scholars have pointed out that datafication implies a series of risks, as well as new forms of 
exclusion and inequality for vulnerable populations and minor ities. This paper studies, 
through the analysis of interviews of residents of informal settlements in Lima, Peru, 
whether intensive data collection in informal settlements is considered a process to access 
justice by vulnerable communities.  
 
The study conc ludes that in the short term, datafication does not give access to justice to 
vulnerable communities but in fact, deepens or reproduces instances of oppression by 
reinforcing the perception of their lack of knowledge, lack of capabilities or lack of author ity 
to use data to lead their own development. However, participating in the process of 
datafication sparked an interest among community leaders about the different ways in 
which data could be used to further their capabilities, mobilize collective action and address 
their development needs. Community leaders are interested and willing to use data in 
constructive ways to collaborate with diverse actors and transform their conditions. 
However, this interest, power and potential needs to be activated through capability 
development and the cooperation of data partners willing to invest their resources to 
provide this training. The paper closes with a list of recommendations, suggested by 
community leaders from informal settlements, on how to build a community -based data 
collection model that redresses harms and individual forms of injustice from previous 
experiences.

 9A. Introduction  
 
“As a society we have learned to perpetuate inequality by building walls, gates and 
divisions that go beyond the physical and reinforce the idea that the city is only for a 
few people” (TECHO –Perú, 2018)  
 
In Peru, and most parts of Latin America and the wider global South, the state does not 
collect basic data about the living conditions of informal settlements. Thei r absence results 
in a two -tiered system of citizenship. Those who live in informal settlements and their needs 
remain invisible in public data and as a result are not considered as part of the urban reality 
of the city (Canales and Maulen, 2011). This new  form of invisibility reinforces a historical 
inequality that Peruvian anthropologist José Matos Mar has described as the existence of 
two Perus : the “official Peru” made up of formal institutions and the “marginalized Peru” 
made up of urban masses that op erate in clandestinity (see also Plöger, 2012).  
 
In response to this situation, non -governmental organizations (NGOs) have become 
important curators of data from informal urban settlements in Peru. In particular, the NGO 
TECHO –Perú, the Peruvian branch of TECHO – an organization with over 15 years of 
experience working on social development and affordable housing projects in contexts of 
urban poverty – is producing datasets about life in local informal settlements through a 
cadastral survey  or Relevamiento56 in Spanish. Through this data -intensive work, TECHO –
Perú is attempting to integrate the “marginalized Peru” into a “datafied official Peru” and 
improve the representation of the former’s needs in public policies (TECHO –Perú, 2018). In 
other words, the ai m of their work is to take informal settlements from a state of invisibility 
and injustice to one of visibility and justice in and through data.  
 
This study takes a closer look at this assumption: that intensive data collection in informal 
settlements can be a process to access justice for vulnerable communities. The working 
premise of the Relevamiento  is that the “the violation of rights in informal settlements is 
furthered by the absence of data” (TECHO –Perú, 2018). By producing data about informal 
settle ments, TECHO –Perú implies data can act as a “currency” through which individuals can 
exercise their rights and access different forms of justice. However, the literature that 
studies datafication in marginalized urban communities shows this is not always t he case. 
Data scholars have pointed out that datafication implies a series of risks, as well as new 
forms of exclusion and inequality for vulnerable populations and minorities (Donovan, 2012; 
Heeks and Renken, 2018). Data gathering is increasingly being th eorized as a form of 
dispossession (Thatcher et al., 2016) that benefits external actors who have the resources to 
use the information, more than community members who provide their data (Heeks and 
Shekhar, 2019). This study explores these issues from the perspective of the residents of 
informal settlements: What does this data -intensive process mean for them? Do they 
consider that gaining “visibility” through data is a means to access justice? Or do they 
believe it will deepen their risk of further exclusi on or deprivation?  
 
56 The Relevamiento is an adaptati on of a traditional cadastral survey. The cadastral survey focuses on 
collecting information about land property in informal settlements. The Relevamiento collected this 
information, as is explained in Section 9B, but it also collected socio -cultural infor mation about life in these 
spaces.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88

The paper will first provide context to the Relevamiento conducted by TECHO –Perú. It then 
provides an overview of Iris Marion Young’s approach to justice (1990, 2006) and explains 
how we used her understanding of oppression to think abo ut access to justice in data -
related activities in informal settlements. The Methods section describes our process to 
collect testimonies from community members who live in one particular informal 
settlement of Lima – San Juan de Miraflores (SJM) – and the  methodological tools we used 
to interpret their participation as well as their refusal to participate in our study. The 
Findings section describes the common themes that emerged in testimonies regarding data -
related activities in informal settlements, ana lyzed using Young’s concepts. And the 
Discussion section elaborates on how these findings and the experience of SJM can inform a 
community -based data justice model.  
 
This work aims to contribute to a broader understanding of the concept of “data justice” a s 
theorized in early works by Heeks & Renken (2018) and Taylor (2017). The community -
based data justice model can also be a useful tool for data intermediaries like TECHO –Perú 
that are working overtime with limited resources to bring justice and equity to communities 
fraught by urban poverty. But above all, this paper hopes to be a platform from which the 
voices of community members of SJM can inform the design and reduce the harm of future 
data practices implemented by development practitioners in vulnerab le communities.

 9B. Background  
 
9B1. Datafying Informal Settlements in Lima  
Over the past few years, attention has been placed on the importance of creating datasets 
from developing countries and marginalized urban communities as a means to improve 
their representation in the production of knowledge and information (Graham et al.,  2012). 
The open data movement in particular, as part of its mission to promote access to 
knowledge, advocates for bottom -up production of urban datasets in rapidly transforming 
urban societies (Liu et al., 2015). According to data scholars, the production  of data about 
marginalized communities can contribute to more diverse knowledge production, as it 
opens up new research opportunities in urban studies and planning (Crooks et al., 2015), as 
well as contributing to the inclusion of these communities in urb an planning and 
management (Chakraborty et al., 2015). Others have argued, from a more critical 
standpoint, that the datafication of informal settlements can be tied to efforts of policy 
makers to reduce complexity in governance. Kevin Donovan (2012) draws  from James 
Scott’s Seeing  like a State  (1998) to reflect on how the turn to datafication is part of a larger 
effort of state -led “simplification” and “standardization” that enables powerful entities to 
maintain political control over diverse communities57. In all cases, data is conceived as a 
means to activate political will and mobilize policy makers to include informal settlements in 
public policy.  
 
This rationale has been picked up in Latin America. Tamara Canales and Andrea Maulen 
(2011) who studied “invisibilization” of informal settlements in Chile argue the absence of 
data about informal settlements in “official figures” makes it impossible for t hese spaces to 
be “quantified, intervened and considered” in public policy and urban planning. Similar to 
other initiatives around the world that open up data of informal settlements such as Map 
Kibera or Map Mathare from Kenya, TECHO –Perú’s work is a resp onse to “the urgency to 
make visible  the conditions of poverty and vulnerability in which informal settlers live” in 
Latin America (TECHO –Perú, 2018).  
 
In the specific case of Lima, TECHO –Perú (2018) suggests that the invisibility of informal 
settlements i n public policy disqualifies the sector as a potential area of public investment, 
leaving its communities in a situation of precarious access to services and territorial 
segregation. Furthermore, they argue that collecting this data can also stimulate citi zen 
action. As in the case of Map Kibera, the absence of an open, up -to-date dataset about 
informal settlements, “leaves their [residents] disempowered and unable to use information 
to solve problems”, excluding them from debates that influence policy and from the 
possibility of using this information to drive their own development (Hagen, 2011).  
 
With these objectives in mind, TECHO designed the Relevamiento project : a large -scale 
regional effort to generate information to locate, quantify and develop a so cio-territorial 
characterization (who lives there, types of organizations, needs, etc.) of informal 
 
57 Both Scott and Donovan warn that this over -simplification is against the interest of the public. It threatens to 
reduce the public’s political autonomy and their ability to participate in decision making. In the words o f 
Donovan: “What changes through state simplification is that information becomes accessible on a larger scale, 
one where community ties are less influential.” (Donovan, 2012).  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88

 settlements in Latin America. The data collection methodology was designed by the Centre 
for Social Research (CSR) of TECHO in Chile and mainstreamed across  local branches of 
TECHO in Latin America. So far the cadaster or Relevamiento has been done in Argentina, 
Chile, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Uruguay at the national level, and in Guatemala City, 
Bogotá, Asunción, Turgua and Lima at the city level. In Peru, the Relevamiento was 
conducted in the district of San Juan de Miraflores (see Figure 1), one of the five areas with 
the highest concentrations of urban poverty in Lima, according to the Ministry of 
Development and Social Inclusion58. This district has a to tal population of 432,282 people 
and is also considered the 8th most populated district in Lima hosting approximately 5% of 
the total population (TECHO –Perú, 2018).

(TECHO –Perú, 2018)  
 
The main data collection instrument was a survey designed by TECHO’s CSR to collect socio -
territorial and geo -referenced data of the settlements in a standardized manner. Before 
deploying the questions, TECHO –Perú adapted the survey to the local context. They held a 
meeting with diverse actors that included state representatives, academics, community 
leaders from SJM, civil society organizations and private sector entities. The feedback 
 
58 In Lima, 3.6 million people – from a total population of 9.3 million – live i n urban poverty (Redacción 
Gestión, 2017). Most of the urban poor live in “urban marginal cities”, areas characterized by the total or 
partial absence of infrastructure and basic services such as water network, electric energy or drainage system 
(Dede, 201 8; Ministerio de Vivienda, 2017). Informal settlements are sub -sets of urban marginal cities where 
more than half of the population do not have a property title (TECHO –Perú, 2018).

 provided in this meeting was incorporated into the survey. Th e survey was then conducted 
in SJM by 10 staff members and 300 volunteers (see Figure 2) who were trained to collect 
data and survey every household in SJM between October 2017 and June 201859. The data 
collection was conducted using Kobo Toolbox, an open source digital app developed by the 
Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, designed for non -governmental organizations that conduct 
research in the midst of humanitarian crises. According to TECHO –Perú (2018), Kobo 
Toolbox allowed them to work more efficiently, since it automatically generated an online 
database, aggregated the data and mapped the geo -referenced coordinates of the informal 
settlements . 
 
The results of the Relevamiento were published in 2018 and it  made available 
unprecedented data about SJM. It i dentified 138 informal settlements within SJM and 
estimated that at least 46,755 families live in a situation of informality, which represents 
10.8% of the total population. It collected information regarding their lack of access to 
services: finding that 91% of informal settlements do not have access to the public water 
network, 92% do not have a drainage system, and 97% of settlements do not have property 
titles. It also collected information about community governance and social relations 
between SJM res idents. It found that 80% of residents appreciate community solidarity and 
that 95% of settlements have a community board60 recognized by the local municipality. It 
concluded that informal settlements are predominantly political spaces where “governance 
is characterized by self -management of their territories and the struggle for their rights” 
(TECHO –Perú, 2018).  
 
The data was  published in an open data portal and presented to Congress representatives, 
SJM community leaders and civil society organizations. So far, its publication has inspired a 
working group in the Peruvian Congress to address the main problems affecting informa l 
settlements and has also been picked up by local media. According to the Executive Director 
of TECHO –Perú, it has not impacted public policy at a large scale, but they have been 
successful at initiating a public conversation. I t is still unclear whether community members 
consider this data -intensive process has created new opportunities to access justice for 
them or not.

Relevamiento.

9B2. Investigating Dat a Justice using Concepts Developed by Iris Marion 
Young  
To investigate access to justice through data we turn to the work of Iris Marion Young (1990, 
2006); specifically her conceptualization of structural injustice and how it can be challenged.  
Young defi nes social justice as “the elimination of institutionalized domination and 
oppression” (1990, p 15); where domination and oppression refer to institutional 
constraints that prevent individuals from developing their capacities, expressing their needs, 
thoug hts and feelings, and participating in discussions related to decisions that directly or 
indirectly influence their lives (Young, 1990; Uhde, 2010). This conception of injustice and 
oppression is structural. Young argues justice is not the result of a spec ific choice, policy or 
program (1990, p 5), but that these power dynamics are sustained by the norms, rules and 
practices present in the social, economic and political structures in which we participate. In 
our case study, this prods us to look beyond the effects of the Relevamiento itself, and to 
consider if this initiative is contributing to larger social and cultural dynamics that produce 
injustice.  
 
According to Young, structural domination and oppression constrain the self -determination 
and self -develo pment of social groups61 in different ways, affecting the power and 
capabilities they have to make decisions about their own lives.  
 
61 Young defines a social group as a collective of persons differentiated from at least one other group by 
cultural forms, practices, or way of life. Members of a group have a specific affinity with one another because 
Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
219 
  
“Structural injustice exists when social processes put large categories of persons 
under a systematic threat of domination or deprivation of the means to develop and 
exercise their capacities, at the same time as these processes enable others to 
dominate or have a wide range of opportunities for developing and exercising their 
capacities.” (Young, 2006, p 114)  
 
To d etermine if a social group is oppressed, Young describes five forms of oppression, from 
which we draw three: exploitation, marginalization and powerlessness (see Table 1)62. These 
concepts are grouped into a sub -category of injustices that lead to the work  and social 
contribution of individuals not being recognized in society (Uhde, 2010). These concepts are 
useful to understand if those who participated in the data collection process led by TECHO –
Perú perceive datafication as a process that sustains or cha llenges former or current 
experiences of oppression.  
 
Concept  Definition  Pathway to justice  
Exploitation  The social process by which the 
results of work performed by one 
social group are appropriated to 
benefit another  Reorganization of institutions and 
practices of decision making and 
alteration of the division of labor  
Marginalization  A social group is expelled from 
useful participation in social life, 
and experiences uselessness, 
boredom, and lack of self -respect  Establishing cultural, practical, and 
institutionalized conditions for

Powerlessness  A social group experiences lack of

conditions in which those who hold 
power recognize the authority, 
expertise and influence of the social 
group  
 
Table 1: Summary of analytical framework concepts retrieved from Young (2012)  
 
Young also sheds light on how oppressed social groups can take action to access justice. In 
the social connection model of responsibility63 she develops in Responsibility and Global 
Justice (2006), she  explains that every individual who participates in economic, social or 
cultural proc esses, including those who experience oppression, bears a degree of 
responsibility for the unjust outcomes they produce (Young, 2006). Even though this may 
sound counter -intuitive, this definition recognizes that groups who are usually perceived as 
the vic tims of injustice have the power to change their conditions through collective action. 
They not only have a greater interest in structural transformation, but also have unique 
insights into the sources of structural injustice. In this sense, remedying inju stice involves 
creating the institutional conditions in which oppressed groups can harness their power to 
change their conditions. While identifying what these conditions should be was out of the 
 
of th eir similar experience or way of life, which prompts them to associate with one another more than with 
those not identified with the group, or in a different way (Young, 1990).  
62 The other two concepts are violence and cultural imperialism (Young, 1990).

220 
 scope of this study, we sought to recognize these unique ins ights by documenting the 
recommendations of community members on how datafication could create new 
opportunities for capability development and collective action.  
 
Overall, Young’s approach to social justice is useful to evaluate how the global turn to 
datafication is impacting local communities, and in particular, how the social processes that 
arise from datafication may put vulnerable communities at risk of further domination or 
deprivation. At the same time, there is an instrumental value to investigatin g data -related 
dynamics from the perspective of community members. Through the concepts developed by 
Young, we could assess if community members consider datafication furthers relations of 
oppression, or if it activates their agency and affords them opport unities to engage in 
collective action to transform their conditions through data. A summary of our approach is 
presented in Table 2.

 9C. Methods  
 
To learn about community perspectives, we conducted four in -depth unstructured 
interviews with SJM community leaders (or dirigentes ) that mobilize social development 
programs within SJM and who are the point of contact for TECHO –Perú. For the interview 
itself, we used open -ended interview schedules that guided the conversation along the lines 
of the aforementioned themes. The interviews were then analyzed by the research team to 
identify common themes that capture the perspectives of SJM community members 
regarding the collection and use of their data in urban planning processes such as the 
Relevamiento . This approach was inspired by the work of Tawana Petty, Mariella Saba, 
Tamika Lewis, Seeta Peña Gangadharan and Kim M. Reynolds in Our Data Bodies Project  
(Petty et al., 2018). This report collected testimonies of individuals who are targeted for 
intensive data collection “as they confront data collection and data -driven systems in the 
process of meeting their basic human needs” in order to “identify commonal ities and 
differences” between those testimonies while honoring the diverse histories and contexts of 
interviewees (2018, p 2). Drawing from their methodology, we analyzed the perceptions 
that inform the decisions SJM community members are making regarding  data -related 
activities and sought to emphasize how these emerge in a particular context of structural 
injustice.  
 
We also consulted ethnographic methods designed to negate extractive forms of knowledge 
production that privilege our research interests ove r those of the community we were 
interviewing. Max Liboiron (2018) and her team at the Civic Laboratory for Environmental 
Action Research in Newfoundland have been exploring what community peer review might 
look like and how to iteratively check in with re searched communities to ensure consent 
over time. In this spirit, we created opportunities to obtain input and reiterative consent 
both from TECHO –Perú and the SJM community. For six months, we held several meetings 
with TECHO –Perú and collaborated with th eir staff to design the research process. This 
involved requesting their input regarding research deliverables, such as the funding 
proposal and the study write -up, requesting their consent whenever there was a change in 
research scope and making a commitm ent to work together at the completion of the study 
to translate research findings into actionable data collection strategies. The relationship 
with the SJM community was mediated by TECHO –Perú (e.g., see Figure 3). All of the 
interviews with community lea ders were coordinated by the Research Director of TECHO –
Perú, conducted along with a TECHO –Perú volunteer and held in SJM around the availability 
of community leaders. We took these measures to ensure the research did not harm the 
relationship of trust tha t has been built between SJM and TECHO –Perú over the past 15 
years.  
 
In spite of these efforts, many community members refused to participate in our study. We 
initially hoped to conduct at least ten interviews with community leaders. The process of 
contact ing them, setting a time to visit the informal settlements and securing their 
availability took three months, and only four interviews were secured. Eight community 
members refused or were unavailable to participate.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88

Ruha Benjamin (2016) has worked on the concept of “informed refusal” and how expressing 
refusal creates n ew, more equitable relationships between researchers and researched 
communities. Indigenous scholar Audra Simpson (2007) also describes the choice of refusal 
as an articulation “to ourselves and to outsiders” of “who we are, who you are and these 
are my ri ghts”. We interpret their refusal as an intention to set boundaries with TECHO –
Perú and our organization regarding the use of their time and their information. Kim Tall 
Bear (2013) also prods us to consider these silences “as productive and supportive” of the 
self-determination of social groups (Benjamin, 2016). Future data justice research that seeks 
to involve the perspectives of communities who are constantly the target of data collection 
must be aware of these constraints and allow for refusal and silen ce to inform and adapt 
the research timeline in constructive ways.  
 
Finally, to complement the interviews, we also conducted desktop research about informal 
settlements in Peru and TECHO –Perú´s research methodologies, and undertook two 
interviews with TECH O–Perú staff who participated in the design or implementation of the 
Relevamiento . With this information, we sought to contextualize the information provided 
by community members regarding the involvement of TECHO –Perú in SJM and learn more 
about community  partnerships with the organization.

 9D. Findings  
 
This section summarizes our findings to address our two research questions, that address: a) 
if community members of SJM consider datafication – or acquiring visibility through data – a 
process through wh ich they can access justice as operationalized by Young; and b) if 
community members of SJM consider datafication a process through which they can 
develop capabilities and activate collective action to remedy injustice.  
 
9D1. Datafication as a Process to A ccess Justice  
Through the interviews, we found that community members spoke favorably about the 
intention to systematize and standardize the problems of SJM with the Relevamiento . 
However, interviewees also provided examples of how the data collection proc ess and its 
aftermath is sustaining experiences of Young’s three forms of oppression – powerlessness, 
exploitation and marginalization – that already exist within the community of SJM.  
 
Datafication and powerlessness64 
We found that participating in the Relevamiento  impacted the community’s perceptions 
regarding their own power in three ways. First, SJM community leaders believe the 
Relevamiento and the production of a data -based report about SJM, could empower them 
to m ake more objective and effective diagnosis of their development problems.  
 
“The Relevamiento is very important. Our work needs to be based on a diagnosis. 
Imagine if we start working without knowing anything and we do everything based 
on our opinion. Sudde nly we will leave aside the highest priority for the community. If 
you do not work with a diagnosis, you do not have a good result. Thanks to TECHO –
Perú we have been able to identify our priorities.”  
 
“We have worked with data [before]. We [used it to make] a short and medium -term 
schedule. This is how we built our stepped pathways and obtained street lighting. 
That schedule was done with TECHO –Perú and with their orientation.”  
 
The turn towards data -driven planning is not only in demand at the policy l evel, but is now 
becoming increasingly valued at the community level as well, most likely as a result of 
exposure to datafication processes. This also implies that other ways of knowing based on 
intuition, opinions or lived experiences are perceived as les s valid or useful to plan and 
execute community programming than data -intensive approaches. In the long run, the 
growing pervasiveness of data collection exercises in the community may impact the forms 
of knowledge the community welcomes, values and desire s to describe their context.  
 
Second, the data produced through the Relevamiento  was thought of as a tool they could 
use to challenge their own sense of powerlessness in front of more powerful actors. In 
particular, community members who considered data to  be a source of legitimacy and 
authority, thought the Relevamiento could enable them to communicate on more equitable 
terms with three individuals and institutions. First, the municipal government authorities: 
 
64 This section summarizes findings that speak to whether datafication furthers power lessness – be it by 
furthering a sense of lack of authority, a feeling of incapability, or exposure to disrespectful treatment.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
224 
 who have most power and political interest to improve the living conditions of SJM. Second, 
central government authorities such as Congress representatives and policy makers who can 
steer political will and public narratives surrounding informal settlements. And third, 
research and civil society organ izations who regularly visit informal settlements and request 
up-to-date data to understand the needs of the community and plan the scope of their 
work.  
 
“When the survey began, municipality authorities said: “we are going to support and 
listen to everyone ”. The municipality was very willing to support the Relevamiento 
and use the data to support the needs that we have in the future. And who better 
than the municipality, to implement and make the most of the results of the 
Relevamiento? ” 
 
“There are several  [civil society] organizations that come in to work and require 
information. Such as how many women currently live in the community, or what are 
the occupations of our neighbors. It would be important for me to be able to use the 
data collected by the Rele vamiento to provide them this information.”  
 
However, most community members mentioned having the data in and of itself is not 
enough to use it effectively to enable collaboration. They emphasized the crucial role played 
by TECHO –Perú as an intermediary th at should not only collect and share this data, but 
should also provide advice on how to use it strategically to mobilize power and resources. 
The expectation to continue working with TECHO –Perú is grounded in the trust the SJM 
community has placed in the organization, however it also threatens to generate 
dependency on the organization and further the notion that the community is incapable of 
using data to obtain support from powerful actors without their mediation.  
 
And third, community leaders consider t he Relevamiento is an opportunity to challenge 
misleading discourses about informal settlements and what life is like in these spaces. 
Culturally, those who live in informal settlements are subject to racism, classism and other 
forms of oppressive discours es that portray the members of settlements as informal, illegal 
and invisible outsiders, and are used to delegitimize their perspectives and expectations of 
development (Sakay et al., 2011). Community members believe that these discourses are 
not only held  by the general public, but also by decision makers such as policy makers or 
public service providers. In their view, becoming visible through data is an opportunity to 
speak to these actors, tell their stories in their complexity and mostly, to be heard w ith 
empathy. However, some community leaders felt the questions asked in the survey of the 
Relevamiento  did not give them this opportunity:  
 
“There were a lot of questions missing in the questionnaire65. Sometimes I thought: ‘I 
want you to ask me this’ but it was not in the questionnaire. The questions 
lacked...empathy. They did not ask: Why is the community like this? Why have you 
not progressed? I would have liked to be asked questions about why we do not have 
 
65 TECHO –Perú staff explained that even though they sought to include more qualitative questions in the questionnaire, 
they were constrained by the standardized survey designed by the Centre for Social Research from TECHO in Chile. The 
regional branch from Chile had encouraged them to use the same questions to make comparative analyses across the 
region.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
225 
 property titles until now. I have plenty of stories. Stories about terrorism, crime in the 
area. There are a lot of topics to be heard about.”  
 
They expressed discomfort about how the data produced by the Relevamiento will now 
shape what people kn ow about SJM without providing the context or a more 
comprehensive explanation that humanizes informal settlers. As a result, one of their fears 
is that the final diagnosis  produced by the Relevamiento misrepresents their reality, and 
does not get to the d eeper structural factors that facilitate or constrain their development. 
Furthermore, if community members cannot verify what story is being told by the data, they 
will not be able to identify whether this narrative is harmful to their community and if so,  
make informed decisions regarding the impact of future data collection activities:  
 
“The fear is that the information is not real, that it does not reflect our needs and 
that only some [people] have been represented [in the data]. That the final results 
don’t reflect what we really want. The intentions behind this work have been really 
good but we worry that we will look at the information and think: what is this good 
for? We do not know if this is the case, because we have not seen it. Only after seeing 
the results, we will know if the job is well done. If it reflects the real needs. Only then 
we can talk about solutions.”  
 
This problem was also evident in an anecdote told by the Executive Director of TECHO –Perú. 
When a local newspaper shared the results o f the Relevamiento (Rosas, 2018) , it 
emphasized the unsafe living conditions of SJM. While TECHO –Perú thought this was a great 
opportunity to raise awareness about urban poverty in Lima, community leaders were 
disappointed with the coverage. They felt that  the report oversimplified the problem and 
did not highlight the community -led initiatives to reduce the risks. This discomfort suggests 
that the data collection and dissemination process, as it is currently designed, is not 
determined by how community mem bers choose to tell their stories, but is rather ruled by 
what intermediaries such as TECHO –Perú believe will be most effective approach to obtain 
institutional attention and support. In this sense the interests, priorities and decisions of the 
intermediar y prevail over those of the community.  
 
Datafication and exploitation66 
We found that exploitation manifested in two ways. First, there is a general perception that 
community leaders who participated in the Relevamiento  have not benefited from having 
participated. Two years have passed since the Relevamiento  was conducted and to this 
date, many remain uncertain about how this data is being used, who is using it and what 
they have gained due to this process. The interviews show community leaders are still 
unsure about whether their expectations were taken into consideration:  
 
“The neighbors asked TECHO –Perú: In what way will this be useful or beneficial for 
us? What are we going to obtain from participating? The TECHO –Perú representative 
explained that the survey would tell us the most urgent problems we have, and we 
told him tha t [we already knew] that our most urgent problem was lack of access to 
 
66 This section summarizes fi ndings that speak to whether the Relevamiento created conditions of exploitation 
for community leaders in which more powerful groups benefitted from their work.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
226 
 clean water. It has been almost two years since the Relevamiento  and nothing has 
improved. Things are still the same. We wanted progress, but [our district] has the 
least clean and most  expensive water in all of Lima. And the Relevamiento  is not 
attacking this problem. Maybe it is attacking other problems. We did not want this 
Relevamiento to be just a study, a paper. We want it to translate to ‘obras’ – to 
tangible outcomes.”  
 
Even thou gh consent was obtained to conduct the research, it is not clear whether TECHO –
Perú was aware of why community members chose to participate in this process and 
provide their data. Were community leaders expecting an outcome in particular? Did they 
explicit ly delegate the decisions regarding data use to the data intermediary, in this case 
TECHO –Perú? Did they create a system to demand accountability from the intermediary? By 
asking community members why they want to participate, data intermediaries can learn 
about the value communities ascribe to their raw data and thoughtfully incorporate these 
expectations into the design of their criteria for consent, use of data and the  process of data 
collection.  
 
Second, the reluctance to demand results from the Relevamiento is tied to the technical, 
capability and knowledge constraints faced by community members. Currently, they lack a 
general understanding about where  to find the dat a and how they can use this data to 
generate action. These constraints also limit the decisions communities can make regarding 
their data and how they would like to use it to address their development needs. 
Interviewees suggested TECHO –Perú should host re gular assemblies every year to present 
the results of the Relevamiento and ensure there is continuity in the action plans that have 
been devised based on the results.  
 
“The Relevamiento  should be presented in front of the recently elected community 
leaders  who are preparing their work plan. The new leaders do not know anything. It 
would be good to have a meeting every year and tell them: this is what we collected 
and learned from the Relevamiento. ” 
 
Even though the final report of the Relevamiento  has been published in an open data portal, 
most community members do not have access to the digital devices, infrastructure or know -
how to find it. As a result, many have not been able to use the data or request updates 
about the state of the study. The lack of acc ess to it creates a situation in which the data can 
ultimately only be used for the purpose, benefits or interests of those who can access it and 
creates conditions of exploitation in which community members participate in a data 
collection process to prod uce an output they are not able to enjoy or use.  
 
Datafication and marginalization67 
We found that while the Relevamiento  is creating a space in which voices and needs of 
historically marginalized communities can be represented, it is also amplifying socia l 
divisions and political struggles that already existed within SJM. The conflicts interviewees 
mentioned are diverse and complex, spanning from political tensions between community 
 
67 This section summarizes findings that speak to whether the Relevamiento led community members  to feel 
excluded from useful participation in social life.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
227 
 leaders, accusations of corruption, and ethnic tensions between immigrants  from different 
regions of Peru. Community leaders talked about how the data collection process 
contributed to these tensions.  Even though TECHO –Perú made an effort to include as many 
community groups in the process as possible, ultimately, coordination me etings were most 
frequent with the groups that had the most political leverage and who were more effective 
at building partnerships with civil society organizations. The process ultimately became 
politicized and was perceived by some as biased:  
 
“When the survey came around, I felt it became biased little by little. I felt that it only 
considered some people and left other people aside. There are communities with 
whom progress has been made, while with us, the communication slowed down. We 
feel like we are not being listened to. As a resident, you think to yourself: ¿ya para 
qué? - What is the point of participating?”  
 
This sent the message to those who already felt marginalized by the data collection process 
that only the needs of the most powerful groups o f the community would be represented in 
the Relevamiento and that as a result, only their concerns would be integrated into the 
public agenda. In other words, that only those who actively participated in the Relevamiento 
process would be able to access jus tice, while the rest would be excluded from the debates 
and programs designed after this data. This belief has been strengthened by the difficulties 
some community members are having to work with the municipal government:  
 
“The municipality closes many doo rs for us. If you do not agree with them, they 
marginalize you. If you do not agree with their thoughts, they marginalize you. Why 
should I go and negotiate [with them] if I am not going to be listened to?”  
 
Data is not sufficient to enable collaboration b etween different actors and ensure the 
equitable participation of the least powerful groups. Be it between municipal government 
authorities and SJM residents, or between community leaders, inclusion and collaboration is 
ultimately more contingent on commun ity relations than on availability of information or 
data. Recognizing the political conflicts and social divisions of the community and how they 
will affect the access and use of information, is a precondition to using this data effectively 
as a political  and social tool to redress power imbalances. This also places more 
responsibility on civil society organizations that collect data in historically neglected 
populations to develop mechanisms that identify pre -existing community conflicts and 
mitigate poss ible risks or harms brought about by the intervention.

A summary of these findings is presented in Table 3.  
 
Form of 
Injustice  Instances in which Injustice can be 
Challenged Through Datafication  Instances in which Injustice can be 
Sustained Through Datafication  
Powerlessness  • The data collection process has led to 
an appreciation of data and data -
based planning by the community.  
• Data is perceived as a valuable asset 
that ought to be used, managed and 
applied by the community to 
tran sform their living conditions.  
• Communicating the problems of the 
community using data is perceived as 
an opportunity to demonstrate the 
urgency of the problems faced by 
informal settlers and highlight the 
most pressing needs.  
• Some community members believe  
the use of data grants legitimacy, 
authority and objectivity to 
community knowledge.  
• Data allows community members to 
communicate and cooperate on more 
equitable terms with powerful actors 
who consider data -based knowledge 
a more accurate and trustworthy 
source of knowledge.  • The data collection and dissemination 
process is not determined by the 
priorities of community members but 
is rather ruled by what intermediaries 
such as TECHO –Perú, believe will be 
most effective approach to obtain 
institutional atten tion and support.  
• The turn to datafication is making data 
more valuable. Data is considered 
more legitimate and useful than other 
ways of knowing such as intuition, 
opinions or lived experiences that are 
also present in the community.  
• The role of an intermediary that 
advises communities on how to use 
the data effectively could generate 
dependency and further the notion 
that the community is incapable of 
using this data without their 
mediation.  
• Community members fear a data -
based narrative about the re alities of 
the informal settlement that lacks 
context portrays them in harmful, 
undesirable or dehumanizing ways.  
Exploitation  • Community members are demanding 
accountability from the data 
intermediary; TECHO –Perú. They wish 
to know how their data has bee n 
used and who is benefitting from it.  
• Criteria for obtaining consent in data 
collection processes can incorporate 
the decisions made by community 
members regarding their data: such 
as why they are providing it and what 
they are expecting in return.  • Commun ities remain uncertain about 
how the data has been used, who is 
using it and what they have gained due 
to this process.  
• Data is published in open data portals 
community members cannot access 
due to technical, capability and 
knowledge constraints.  
• These con straints also limit the 
decisions communities can make 
regarding their data and how they 
would like to use it to address their 
development needs.  
Marginalization  • Datafication creates a space in which 
voices and needs of historically 
marginalized communities can be 
represented.  
• Data can be used to capture attention 
of powerful actors such as elected 
government officials, international 
development organizations and policy 
makers.  • If the data collection process does not 
include every com munity, it risks 
amplifying the voices of the most 
powerful groups within the 
community.  
• Data is not enough to spark the 
interest of political actors. Political will 
is more contingent on community 
relations than on availability of 
information or data.

 9D2. Datafication as a Process to Develop Capabilities and Take Action  
A more strategic use of community data could enable community leaders to challenge 
oppressive relations an d take action to transform their conditions. Iris Marion Young argues 
in the social connection model of responsibility (2006, p 123) that “structural processes can 
be altered only if many actors in diverse social positions work together to intervene in the se 
processes to produce different outcomes”. SJM community leaders identified three ways in 
which they can participate on more equitable terms in data -based initiatives and decisions. 
These ideas contemplate data capability development and are oriented tow ards improving 
conditions for decision making regarding the use of data in community development.  
 
Datafication has generated interest in the community towards developing data capabilities  
The data -intensive process facilitated by TECHO –Perú has sparked a strong interest in the 
community to develop data capabilities. The frustration of not being able to access the data 
has led community leaders to reflect upon the value data has for their co mmunity and how 
they could use it in strategic ways to improve their livelihoods and collaborate with diverse 
actors. Even though the community of SJM already collects its own data through 
community -based initiatives, community leaders seem interested in l earning to conduct 
large -scale, systematic processes such as the Relevamiento. Among the examples they 
provided, they wish to be able to access the data generated by the Relevamiento, cross -
reference it with community data, and use it to inform ongoing com munity development 
programs and to improve management and planning of the community resources.  
 
Community leaders want to transition from being data providers to data owners  
After the Relevamiento, community leaders think of data as a source of power and a s a 
valuable asset. However, they currently lack the technical resources, knowledge and 
infrastructure to engage with it in a meaningful way and to set the terms for its use. A 
community leader used a powerful metaphor to explain how data could contribute to self -
determination by comparing it to a “multi -purpose knife” or a “first -aid backpack”, in that 
their utility depends on the readiness and sophistication of the user.  
 
“The results of the Relevamiento  should be like a first -aid backpack or a multi -
purp ose knife. These knives have scissors, a bottle opener, a screwdriver, even a little 
hammer. Everything that could help me in an emergency. That is what the 
Relevamiento  should do. It is a tool for us and also for the authorities. But you have 
to know how to use it. You need to know where to find it.”.  
 
“If you give us the results on paper, [...] we will not understand what that report 
means. If someone comes and explains it to us: ‘now you have this benefit, or you can 
achieve this, and this. Or we have ac hieved this and this with the survey.’ If it benefits 
us, we are going to do something with it.”  
 
To address this gap, community leaders suggest the development of training materials and 
learning modules that build data literacy, digital literacy and digit al rights with an anti -
oppressive lens. Their idea is to bridge the gap between data and the community through 
the use of creative tools, such as animated cartoons, dynamic videos or short movies, “that 
you can watch with the whole family”, and that seek t o situate and humanize data as part of 
“the reality” of the SJM community.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
230 
  
Community -based data infrastructure is key for community data management  
Finally, interviewees also expressed an interest in the creation of community -based data 
infrastructures wh ere communities who provided their data can access it, manage it and set 
terms over how it is used. In practical terms, they suggested the creation of a digital 
repository or platform designed specifically for community leaders, where they can access 
and u pdate their own data.  
 
“All the community leaders of SJM should be able to use and manage that data. [I 
would like to] have a transparency portal with our data. We need a platform 
designed with the specific needs of SJM in mind. The data is currently avail able in a 
link, but they have not designed it with a [community] approach. A community leader 
should be able to access the data and feed the platform with new information. For 
example, if we know that there are more children being born or that there are ne w 
members in the community, we should be able to add it. I’m currently trying to use 
Excel. We need this information to be up -to-date to plan accordingly.”  
 
This suggests that SJM residents aspire to create conditions where they can see themselves 
as the e xperts and “owners” of their data, and create a system in which they have the 
power to decide what data to use and for what purpose. This is not to say that communities 
will use the data in an intrinsically positive or neutral way, but eliminating constrai nts on 
self-determination and self -development can possibly afford communities more agency to 
make decisions regarding data and also place more responsibility on them for how their 
decisions affect the overall system.  
 
Box 1: List of recommendations to bui ld a community -based data collection model  
 
1. Collect information about expectations and aspirations of community members 
around data  
2. Collect multiple forms of data that reflect how communities wish to be portrayed 
publicly  
3. Co-design creative ways in which community members can share their own stories 
and perspectives beyond the use of quantitative data  
4. Explain the value of different forms of data to community members and how each 
form of data can be used to achieve different purposes  
5. Ask for consent b oth when collecting data, and again when using it.  Ask for consent 
not just to collect data, but also about types of data use  
6. Create strategies to cross -reference and integrate community data and data collected 
at a larger scale by external organizations  
7. Build community capacities to use data for program and resource management  
8. Develop digital and non -digital mechanisms to share data with the community aimed 
at reaching diverse publics  
9. Design advocacy roadmaps that outline how data will be used to achieve c ommunity -
defined objectives  
10. Design a community -based data infrastructure where communities who provided 
their data can access it, manage it and set terms over how it is used

9E. Discussion and Conclusions  
 
Datafication is not only a technical process, b ut an activity that is deeply influenced by the 
power dynamics and the social, cultural and political tensions that operate within a given 
context. While in this study we mostly focused on identifying instances of oppression and 
the reproduction of inequal ity in data -intensive practices, Young’s work prodded us to 
consider how residents of historically marginalized communities hold responsibility and 
agency to transform their conditions. Broadly speaking, datafication as it is being 
implemented now does not  create justice for vulnerable communities. In fact, its process 
deepens or reproduces instances of oppression by reinforcing community perceptions 
regarding their lack of knowledge, lack of capabilities or lack of authority to use data to lead 
their own d evelopment.  
 
However, participating in a process of datafication along with a trusted partner such as 
TECHO –Perú, sparked an interest in community leaders about the different ways in which 
they could use data to further their capabilities, mobilize collect ive action and address their 
development needs. Community leaders perceive themselves as capable and willing to use 
data in constructive ways to transform their conditions. This interest and power needs to be 
activated through capability development. The t hemes that emerged in the case study also 
led to the following four reflections:  
 
First, the case illustrates how the cultural meanings given to data in historically marginalized 
communities are as important as the processes and practices we put in place t o use it. In the 
case of Peru and SJM, we learned that datafication had a much stronger political and 
cultural significance than anticipated. For many, data was an objective form of expression 
that conferred authority to community leaders and was able to s ystematize the chaotic, 
complex and misunderstood reality of informal settlements. It also represented the 
opportunity to speak a lingua franca that bridged the gap between powerful decision 
makers from the “official Peru” and communities from the “margina lized Peru”. However, to 
other community leaders, data embodied institutional power. It represented the imposition 
of a new set of rules, unmet expectations and the burden to learn new skills to stay relevant 
in the system. All in all, these perceptions hi ghlight how datafication can simultaneously 
represent hope and oppression for vulnerable communities, and how these perspectives are 
not homogenous. The approach of each individual and each community group to data will 
be situated in their lived experience s and the power relations they are a part of. However, 
this case illustrates how these expectations, concerns, motivations, among others, are 
seldom considered in the design or the aftermath of the data collection process, leading to 
new forms of cultural marginalization, exploitation and powerlessness in which the 
perceptions of data producers and their contributions are ultimately marginalized or 
deemed irrelevant for the final output of the project.  
 
Second, datafication also proved to be a process throu gh which different actors acquire 
power, while others feel powerless or incapable of participating. Institutional actors or 
individuals who feel comfortable with the use of data will resort to datafication as a tool to 
boost their legitimacy and solve thei r problems, as is the case of local authorities who 
demand the use of data in evidence -based policy making or civil society organizations who Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
232 
 require data to legitimize the work they do with vulnerable communities. However, we 
learned that individuals who lack the capabilities necessary to handle data, or the 
opportunities to develop these capabilities, feel they cannot use the data they provided and 
once owned in order to make informed decisions to address their development needs. In 
other words, not devel oping data capabilities creates conditions of exploitation in which 
individuals are providing their data to meet the purposes and benefits of external actors, 
while not being equipped to proactively reap benefits for their own community. A process 
of dataf ication that is not coupled with data capability building, limits the choices individuals 
from marginalized communities can make regarding their own data.  
 
Third, the case of SJM suggests that NGOs and civil society organizations that act as data 
intermediaries can play a fundamental role in developing these capabilities and in enabling 
what Michael Gurstein calls “effective data use” (2011). We learned that the path towards 
becoming an effective intermediary involves understanding how to navigate community —
researcher —practitioner relations in an equitable way. If data intermediaries have the social 
and cultural capital to build relationships of trust with community members, they can also 
create the conditions to develop relevant data capabilities i n the community and boost 
community -based datafication. We consider this should be the ultimate goal of 
organizations that undertake data -intensive practices in vulnerable communities: to create 
the conditions in which datafied systems are built and sustai ned by the community under 
norms, rules and practices set by the community. This is a particularly timely approach. As 
the trend towards datafication grows, every citizen will need these skills to uphold their 
rights and participate in society. Residents f rom informal settlements, along with other 
vulnerable communities will most likely be neglected by this process and will not have 
access to the opportunities to develop these skills in the same measure as other groups in 
society. Data skills and data justi ce principles could position them to assert their agency not 
only in datafication but in their ability to exercise their citizenship in the city.  
 
And finally, the path towards a community -based data justice model involves imagining 
socio -technical practic es and infrastructures that enable community data stewardship. The 
case of SJM illustrated how the Relevamiento was not designed to achieve structural change 
in and of itself, but to create tools SJM residents could use to exist and interact on more 
equitable terms within system. In this sense, the idea of a community -oriented data 
infrastructure is promising. Community members in SJM did not reject the process of 
datafication, but imagined a datafied system in which they would be able to access the d ata, 
and manage it continuously improve it. This introduces a different way to think about data 
that is built on the basis of community – as opposed to individual – ownership and 
stewardship. Many questions remain about the benefits or risks of this model:  what data 
rights do they hold as a community? How can they establish boundaries for external, more 
powerful actors, that wish to access and use their data? Would this model reproduce the 
hierarchies of the current model by establishing gatekeepers and lim ited users of 
information? However, we believe it is a step forward to reduce the power of those who are 
currently leading datafication initiatives, and enable communities to define new rules for 
what datafication in development should do, in what way and for whom.

 9E1. Recommendations  
Practical recommendations were outlined above in Box 1. From an academic standpoint, 
future studies should attempt to use Young’s framework to understand data -related 
injustice. Her concepts were very useful to identify spec ific ways in which datafication could 
mitigate or further an individual sense of injustice. However, more in -depth research is 
required to understand how larger, institutional forms of injustice are challenged or 
sustained by datafication. It is also key t o continue investigating how relations of 
domination -oppression can translate into and affect other areas of life with wider 
implications for livelihood and survival over time. Some questions include: in what ways do 
powerlessness, exploitation and margina lization constrain access to social, economic or 
political participation? How do perceptions of these affect the decisions oppressed 
communities make in their personal, family and community life? How does injustice 
experienced in datafication intersect wit h other forms of powerlessness, exploitation and 
marginalization experienced on the basis of gender, race, socio -economic status, etc.?  
 
To continue developing a community -based data justice model, future studies should 
explore community data management. O n this occasion we found that community 
management is organized around collective action; yet this ideal is constrained by the 
political and ethnic conflicts that exist between the diverse social groups that exist in spaces 
like informal settlements. Many questions remain about what socio -technical systems need 
to be in place to enable effective community data governance: how will their cultural and 
social divisions translate into mechanisms for community data management? Who will have 
the power to manage c ommunity data? What checks and balances will need to be in place 
to ensure representation and accountability? As these questions are tackled, studies should 
continue to center the voices of those who live in marginalized communities and portray the 
diversi ty, complexity and power imbalances they navigate.

Feature  Definition  
Not isolating  In a contex t of structural injustice, finding a few people guilty of perpetrating specific 
wrongful actions does not absolve from bearing responsibility others whose actions 
contribute to the outcomes. A social connection model of responsibility recognizes how 
the ac tions of every actor who participates in the structure has an impact over the just or 
unjust outcomes of the structure.  
Judging background 
conditions  A model of responsibility understands the mediated connection that agents have to 
structural injustices.  It often brings into question the background conditions – historical 
legacies, institutional rules, accepted cultural norms – that shape decision making of 
actors who belong to the structure and perpetuate injustice.  
More forward -
looking than 
backward -looking  
 Assigning and taking responsibility for injustice is more forward -looking than backward -
looking. This recognizes there are an ongoing set of processes that will likely continue 
producing harms unless there are interventions. The point is not to blame, punish, or 
seek redress from those who created a specific act of injustice, but rather to enjoin those 
who participate by their actions in the process of collective action to change it.  
Shared 
responsibility  Shared responsibility recognizes each in dividual is personally responsible for the risks of 
harmful outcomes produced by a group of persons in a partial way. The specific part that 
each person plays in producing the outcome cannot be isolated and identified, thus the 
responsibility is essentiall y shared.  
Discharged only 
through collective 
action  Forward -looking responsibility can be discharged only if many actors in diverse social 
positions work together to intervene in these processes to produce different outcomes.

Parameter  Definition  Young’s reflections regarding action and justice  
Power  The degree of potential or actual 
power or influence over the processes 
that produce the outcomes.  Agents do not always have sufficient energy and 
resources to respond to all structural injustices to 
which they are connected. They should focus on 
those where they have a greater capacity to 
influence structural processes.  
Interest  Degree of interests i n the maintenance 
or transformation of structures that 
produce injustice.  
 Victims of structural injustice often have a greater 
interest in structural transformation. But those with 
the greatest interest in perpetuating the structures 
are those with the gr eatest power to influence their 
transformation.  
Privilege  Degree of privilege acquired by virtue 
of the structures. Privilege often 
coincides with power.  Persons who benefit relatively from structural 
injustices have special moral responsibilities to 
contribute to organized efforts to correct them, not 
because they are to blame, but because they are 
able to adapt to changed circumstances without 
suffering serious deprivation.  
Collective 
ability  When interest, power, and existing 
organization enables peo ple to act 
collectively to influence processes 
more easily regarding one issue of 
justice than another.  The structural processes can be altered only if many 
actors in diverse social positions have the 
capabilities to work together and intervene in these 
processes to produce different outcomes.

Abstract  
 
Can datafication increase the ‘visibility’ of informal settleme nts in South Africa, in the 
context of a national and local state that holds both progressive and repressive approaches 
towards informal settlements? This case study explores a datafication process that has been 
in place for five years in an informal settl ement in Durban, which has been established 
through an inclusionary, participatory data collection and production process.  
 
It examines how and when the data moves in the information value chain, and the 
implications this movement has for achieving rights -based, instrumental, structural and 
distributive justice. It argues that procedural and rights -based justice can be achieved to a 
certain extent through the construction of an inclusionary datafication process. However, 
instrumental, structural and distrib utive justice is dependent on how the interventionist and 
developmental state of South Africa engages with the data, and whether it takes it up in a 
meaningful way, thus enabling it to lead to fundamental shifts in discourses, approaches 
and practices towa rds informality.  
 
The results reveal that the ‘governance and knowledge platforms’ that are built through the 
datafication process are more important and powerful at first, than the actual data itself. 
However, informal settlers and other data intermediari es, who have learnt how to engage 
data to secure the ‘right of informal settlers to the city’, have begun to use the data in 
interesting ways, acting as champions, and re -shaping citizens’ relations with the state. 
While this does not secure tangible chang es in informal settlements, it begins to shift 
discourses and power relations, which is critical to informal settlement upgrading.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88

 10A. Introduction  
 
This case study focuses on the role that urban datafication, including participatory mapping, 
is playing in building social and environmental justice in Quarry Road West informal 
settlement, Durban, South Africa. Quarry Road West informal settlement, which comprises 
approximately 1083 households, is located on the Palmiet River, in the urban core of Durban 
(see Figure 1). Researchers from the School of Built Environment and Development Studies, 
University of KwaZulu -Natal (UKZN), Durban, and ‘mapmakers’ from Quarry Road West 
informal settlement have established a five year partnership within the Palmiet Catchm ent 
Rehabilitation Project (PCRP) as part of an action research project, to improve quality of life 
in the settlement. The PCRP is a pilot project of the uMngeni Ecological Infrastructure 
Partnership (UEIP), which focuses on improving water security in the  uMngeni Catchment 
using ecological infrastructure (Sutherland & Roberts 2014). The researchers and 
mapmakers are co -constructing a range of data and maps at the local scale, producing 
knowledge on the settlement and its governance. This datafication of th e settlement has 
the goal of improving the living environment of residents through informal settlement 
upgrading, supporting social learning, river rehabilitation, climate adaptation, and the 
building of resilience (Martel & Sutherland 2019; Mazeka et al 2 019; Sim et al 2019; Vogel et 
al 2016; Williams et al 2019).  
 
The university researchers and mapmakers continually reflect on ‘if, how and why’ this data 
contributes to, and shapes, the well -being, resilience and development of the community 
and whether it  has helped to build state -citizen relations, which have emerged as being 
critical to ‘good’ urban governance in Durban (Martel & Sutherland 2019; Mazeka et al 
2019). Has this long -term, participatory and time -consuming data production process 
supported th e transformation of the community and addressed development deficits in any 
way? Has it shaped city decision making with respect to the relocation or upgrading of the 
settlement and service provision within it? And has it contributed to shifting broader ci ty 
discourses around the ‘rights’ and ‘place’ of informal settlers in the city? The case study 
therefore reflects on whether ‘data justice for development’ is emerging through the Quarry 
Road West datafication project, and if so, whose interests does it se rve. It identifies the 
levers of change in the datafication project, which have led to development outcomes. It 
also reflects on the barriers and structural constraints in achieving a higher level of data 
justice. Heeks & Shekhar’s (2019) model of data jus tice is used as a framework to assess 
data justice in the Durban case study. This model is expanded to include governance and 
‘critical moments’ as additional elements of data justice, based on evidence from the Quarry 
Road West informal settlement datafic ation project.

The case study provides a critical reflection on the form and level of data justice achieved 
through the participatory methodologies that have been employed in the settlement to 
date. It explores the way in which the data has been produced and travelled be tween the 
community, the university and the municipality, in most instances through ‘bridges’ or ‘data 
Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
241 
 intermediaries’ (Heeks & Shekhar 2019), informing community adaptations, as well as 
municipal responses. The case study therefore explores:  
• how the proce ss of co -constructing and producing data is leading to greater social 
and environmental justice (procedural justice);  
• if and how the data has been used to improve quality of life in the informal 
community and if it has shaped municipal decisions and respon ses to informal 
housing (instrumental justice);  
• the power relations produced both by the data production process and the data 
collected, with an emphasis on the role of bridges or data intermediaries (structural 
data justice);  
• to what extent making the set tlement more ‘visible’ has shifted discourses about 
informal housing in the city, particularly in terms of informal settlers’ ‘rights to the 
city’ (rights -based justice);  
• who has benefited and who has lost through the datafication process (distributive 
justice).  
 
Given that relatively few analyses of real -world initiatives of data justice for development 
have been undertaken (Heeks & Shekhar 2019), this case study makes a contribution by 
both providing an empirical case of emerging data justice in an Africa n city, and by 
expanding Heeks & Shekhar’s (2019) model to include two other elements that shape data 
justice in cities in the South, namely governance and ‘critical moments’. It has also 
broadened the understanding of rights -based justice in the model.  
 
 
10B. Background  
 
10B1. Datafication for Development  
Development depends on data or information for decision making (Heeks & Shekhar 2019; 
Milan & Treré 2017; UN -Habitat 2017). However, the production of, and control over data 
used for development has predo minantly been in the hands of scientists and experts, who 
have provided data to the state and non -state actors for decision making through 
administrative rationalism (Dryzek 2012). According to Dryzek (2012:75) “administrative 
rationalism emphasizes the ro le of the expert rather than the citizen or producer/consumer 
in social problem solving, and stresses social relationships of hierarchy rather than equality 
or competition”.  However, data is now making its way into decision making through 
multiple actors a nd multiple pathways. This is a result of the democratisation of decision 
making through the shift from government to governance, the development of the network 
society (Castells 2000; Hajer & Wagenaar 2003), and the growing volume, velocity, variety 
and v isibility of data, as a result of the digital technologies of the 21st century (Heeks 2018). 
This is leading to the ‘datafication of development’, which is the growing presence, use and 
impact of data in social processes, leading to opportunities for incre ased developmental 
impact through new forms of data streams being produced, shared and translated at 
different scales (Heeks & Shekhar 2019; Mazeka et al 2019; Spratt & Baker 2015; Taylor & 
Broeders 2015). The production, sharing and use of data is particu larly important for the 
urban poor, who to date have been largely excluded from data production processes in Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
242 
 cities in the South, due to their perceived and constructed illegibility, informality and lack of 
power.  
 
In focusing on the power of datafication in supporting development, it is critical to 
differentiate between big data, digital data and ‘local’ or community -produced data. Taylor 
(2017) argues that datafication tends to focus on digital data or the data people emit 
through the technologies that ci tizens, the private sector and the state employ to both 
participate in and be accountable to society. However, what happens to development, if the 
data emitted by people does not focus on or address the challenges of urban poverty, 
marginalisation, and inf ormality in the city? Large numbers of the urban poor do not emit 
digital data on a regular basis. For example, the contribution of informal settlers to state 
coffers through payment for rates and services is often limited or non -existent, as their 
presenc e in the city is seldom digitally recorded, and they do not pay for services through 
formal administrative systems, as services in informal settlements are often free or illegally 
obtained. The urban poor are connected to digital systems of data collection  through smart 
phone technology and the use of the internet, but this is often intermittent due to the cost 
of, and hence their lack of access to, data. As Milan & Treré suggest (2017: 3019), “the 
underprivileged, the silenced, the subaltern, and the “have  nots,” whose presence outdoes 
geographical boundaries, often remain in the blind spot” and hence they remain invisible.  
 
At the same time, datafication has provided institutions and corporations, whose interest it 
is to manage and govern people, with new ‘technologies of rule’ and hence power (Li 2007). 
This can lead to development when undertaken in a socially transformative manner, but it 
can also produce greater inequality and marginalisation in spaces where human rights are 
most fragile (Heeks & Shekha r 2019; Milan & Treré 2017). Taylor & Broeders (2015) argue 
that big data and its processes of informational capitalism serves the interest of the elite or 
those in power, rather than securing socially -just development interventions. This leads to a 
geogra phy of disempowerment as datafication recognises, makes visible and benefits some, 
while excluding and making others invisible and illegal, as they attempt to claim their ‘right 
to the city’ from the ‘bottom of the data pyramid’ (Arora 2016; McQuillan 2015 ). Does 
datafication support individuals and communities with different histories and geographies 
including diverse racial, class, legal and socio -cultural conditions? Or does it reproduce these 
inequalities?  
 
A point of departure in responding to these qu estions is to reflect of who is doing the 
collecting of the data, for what purpose and how. The advent of digital technologies has 
increased the production of data on cities, as new forms and streams of data in decision 
making have emerged and are impactin g on urban development particularly through the 
discourses and practices of the ‘smart cities’ agenda (Heeks 2018). Cities are now being 
mapped using remote sensing, sensors that record environmental data, and by tracking 
mobile phone use, which generates new patterns of life in the city (Lokanathan et al 2016; 
Willis 2017). In all these cases, technology is producing the data to support decision making 
for development with experts controlling both the production and use of data. Datafication 
therefore has the potential to support development through increased knowledge and 
understanding of citizens’ needs and everyday lived worlds; through ensuring efficiency in 
decision making; and in supporting evidence -based and more transparent development 
(Samarajiva e t al 2015; van Veenstra et al 2014).  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
243 
  
However, there is a growing body of literature which critically reflects on the datafication of 
the city, arguing that the way in which data is collected is not fair or equal; that the use of 
data does not always achie ve just outcomes and that some benefit more than others from 
this process (Baud 2016; Milan & Treré 2017; Taylor & Richter 2015). This has led to the call 
for pro -equity data initiatives (PEDIs), where new forms of data sets and data flows are 
being create d to draw the poor and marginalised into the decision -making processes of the 
city through open data and community -based mapping (Chakraborty et al 2015; Heeks & 
Shekhar 2019; Willis 2017). This approach is supported by a well -established body of 
knowledge  on the value and practices of participatory community -based mapping; an 
important tool in participatory research which emerged in the 1960s (Brown & Kyttä 2014; 
Chambers 2006; Elwood 2006; Mazeka et al 2019; Rambaldi et al 2006). According to 
Rambaldi et al (2006), community -based maps act as vehicles for (spatial) learning, 
discussion, information exchange, analysis, decision making and advocacy and they facilitate 
communication between insiders (the community) and outsiders (researchers, government 
offic ials). The mapping process also has the potential to transform power relations as a 
result of the empowerment that takes place when communities are engaged in the mapping 
of their settlements (Lydon 2003; Mazeka et al 2019; Piccolella 2013).  
 
Community -based mapping has been supported through the dissemination of spatial 
information technologies such as global positioning systems (GPS), (open source) geographic 
information systems (GIS) and open access to spatial data through the internet (Chambers 
2006). T his has opened up a new range of possibilities for ‘participatory GIS’, through which 
local community members record attributes of their community relevant to them in locally -
scaled maps (Gaillard et al 2013; Mazeka et al 2019). Participatory community -based data 
collection and mapping produces different forms of data and data streams to those 
produced through digital technologies, as the data collected is ‘localised’ and ‘embedded’ 
and is produced through collaborative processes that draw on local knowledg e and 
experience. This data can be digitised through the use of GPS and GIS, leading to its 
inclusion in digital data analysis.  
 
This case study explores the datafication of an informal settlement in Durban through 
participatory data practices, produced through a community -university partnership, which is 
attempting to enhance data justice for development. It therefore aims to address the call to 
analyse real -world data production initiatives in the global South, to reflect on how new 
data stream s and datafication are influencing and shaping development at the local scale 
(Heeks & Shekhar 2019; Sengupta et al 2017; Spratt & Baker 2015; Taylor & Broeders 2015). 
Evaluative frameworks are required to determine to what extent data initiatives for the 
urban poor in cities in the South are leading to greater social justice and transformation 
(Heeks & Shekhar 2019). Heeks & Shekhar’s (2019) model for data justice for development 
is employed to critically analyse the datafication process which is emerging in Quarry Road 
West informal settlement in Durban.  
 
10B2. A Framework to Assess Data Justice for Development  
Heeks & Shekhar (2019) have developed a model, or applied data justice framework, which 
explores five dimensions of data justice (see Figure 2). In  developing their model and 
drawing on the data justice literature, they have highlighted three critical elements of data Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
244 
 justice. First, it must be critical and must support procedural, instrumental and rights -based 
justice. Second, the way data is produc ed, flows and is used, determines its transformative 
potential far more than the technology used to produce, process and display it. Third, the 
socio -political context within which the ‘data assemblage’ is produced, including the 
discourses, institutions, social relations and material resources of that context, will shape 
data -related outcomes (Heeks & Shekhar 2019). The case study presented here reflects the 
importance of these three elements of data justice.  
 
Heeks & Shekhar’s (2019) model of the data system for datafication focuses on the different 
forms of justice that emerge out of and support the information value chain, which reflect 
the steps through which  data is transformed into development outcomes.  
 
Figure 2: Heeks & Shekhar (2019) conceptual model of data justice  
 
The five dimensions of data justice as defined by Heeks & Shekhar (2019: 995) are:  
• “Procedural justice: fairness in the way in which data is handled.  
• Instrumental justice: fairness in the results [ or outcomes ] of data being used.  
• Rights -based justice: adherence to basic data rights such as representation, privacy, 
access and ownership.  
• Structural justice: the degree to which the interes ts and power in wider society 
support fair outcomes in other forms of data justice.  
• Distributive justice: an overarching dimension relating to the (in)equality of data -
related outcomes that can be applied to each of the other dimensions of data 
justice.”  
 
The information value chain, which is shaped by and which shapes the five dimensions of 
data justice and the particular socio -economic and political context within which it is 
produced, comprises of three steps: upstream steps of data capture or collection ; mid -
stream steps of data processing and visualisation; and downstream steps of data use in 
decision making. This is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3: The information value chain (Heeks & Shekhar 2019)  
 
This case study will use the information value chain and data justice model – developed by 
Heeks (2017) and applied by Heeks & Shekhar (2019) to four PEDIs in the developing world – 
as an analytical framework to reflect on datafication and data justice in an informal 
settlement in Durban, South Africa. It will expand on a number of elements included in the 
model, as a result of the analys is of datafication undertaken in Quarry Road West informal 
settlement. Context is considered critical to data justice analysis and hence the final part of 
the background section reflects on informality and informal settlements in the global South; 
particul arly in South Africa.  
 
10B3. Informality and Datafication in Cities in the South  
Informality is a way of life both globally and in Durban, with just over 25% of the global 
population and 27% of Durban residents living in informal settlements (eThekwini 
Municipality 2017; UN -Habitat 2018). Poverty, the rapid pace of urbanisation, a lack of 
affordable housing, the decompression of existing crowded urban settlements, migration, a 
decrease in urban household size, natural population increase and e nvironmental risk are 
contributing to the growth in both the number and size of informal settlements (Braathen et 
al 2016; eThekwini Municipality 2017; UN -Habitat 2018). Formal planning processes, 
financial and social resources and state capacity are not a ble to keep pace with housing 
demand in Southern cities, leading to significant housing and service backlogs. As a result, 
the urban poor illegally invade land and develop informal settlements, which reflect their 
efforts at securing their ‘right to the ci ty’ (Lefebvre 1968). Informal settlers typically have no 
security of tenure, only somewhat rarely being granted tenure by the state in progressive 
cities and countries that recognise informal housing as part of urban life (e.g. some locations 
in India, Bra zil and South Africa); they lack access to basic infrastructure and services; they 
have poor standards of housing that usually do not comply with planning and building 
regulations; and they live on marginal or environmentally hazardous sites (Braathen et a l 
2016; Davis 2006; UN -Habitat 2018).  
 
National and city governments in the global South adopt a wide range of responses to 
informal settlements including repressive approaches, where evictions and forced 
relocations are common; ambivalence, where informal  settlers inhabit the city with little

 support from the state; to progressive approaches, where informal settlements are 
considered to be part of the solution to housing the urban poor, with national and local 
governments planning and implementing upgradin g programmes (Braathen et al 2016; 
Dupont 2013; Huchze rmeyer 2011; Satterthwaite et al 2018; Sutherland et al 2016).  
 
Understanding the discourses that national and city authorities and informal settlers adopt 
towards informal housing is therefore critical  in reflecting on their place and future in the 
city. Knowledge and hence data about informal settlements plays a critical role in framing 
the discourses associated with informal settlements and shapes the way in which they are 
governed (Huchzermeyer 2011;  Jordhus -Lier et al 2016). City authorities in the global South 
struggle to address the multiple challenges associated with informal settlements, which are 
distributed across the urban landscape, with their different characteristics, which emerge 
from thei r varied contexts. Human settlement or housing departments in local governments 
therefore tend to focus on informal settlements across the city, collecting data on the 
number, location and boundaries of informal settlements. However, they often have limite d 
knowledge on their internal configuration: their history; age; political organisation and 
social capital; and the number and composition of individual households. This is reflected 
for example, in the significant variation in data on the number and perce ntage of informal 
households in Kisumu in Kenya (Kara nja 2010) and in six cities in India, Peru, Brazil and 
South Africa (Dupont et al 2016). For example, in Durban the percentage of informal 
households varies from 12 percent to 31 percent depending on whi ch state authority is 
doing the counting (Sutherland 2016). Given their scale, informality, dynamic nature and 
complexity, most informal settlements are therefore only ‘known’ or ‘mapped’ at the 
settlement scale by local governments in cities, which render s the ‘human -ness’, 
‘organisation’ and ‘resilience’ of life in an informal settlement invisible to the state (Karanja 
2010; Mazeka et al 2019; Sim et al 2019).  
 
In South Africa, city authorities have lacked the political will, capacity and resources to 
collect detailed data on individual households in informal settlements. Some officials argue 
that given that informal settlements are so dynamic, it is not useful to map or collect data 
on settlements at the household scale, as they grow and change at such a rapid rate (Human 
Settlements Official pers comm 04/07/2017). South African municipalities record data on 
individual households in informal settlements through informal residents registering their 
informal house with their local government Human Settlement s Unit, thereby obtaining a 
housing number, which protects their right to be there and which will be used to allocate 
them a formal state -subsidised house, should relocation take place (see Figure 4).  
 Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
247 
  
Figure 4: Housing number in Quarry Road West informa l settlement registered with the 
Human Settlements Unit (Source: C. Sutherland 06/07/2017)  
 
However, this data is not regularly updated which leads to outdated data being held by the 
city on the size and composition of informal settlements (Mazeka et al 2019). Durban, as 
part of the implementation of the city’s Resilience Strategy, is currently conducting an 
enumeration exercise in its informal settlements in an attempt to obtain more accurate data 
on its 556 informal settlements and 226,000 informal hous eholds (eThekwini Municipality 
2017).  
 
eThekwini Municipality has always had a relatively progressive approach to informal 
housing, which is reflected in, for example, its incremental service provision programme, 
where the local state provides basic servic es, including communal water points, communal 
ablution blocks and electricity, to informal settlements which are not due to be relocated in 
the near future. Efforts around informal settlement upgrading have recently been 
intensified through the iQhaza Leth u Partnership Project, which is a partnership between 
Project Preparation Trust (PPT), Slum/Shack Dwellers International and the Human 
Settlements Unit of eThekwini Municipality. This applied partnership project is funded by 
the European Union (2018 to 202 0). iQhaza Lethu aims to create a cohesive and 
collaborative effort towards upgrading of informal settlements, drawing on the knowledge 
and expertise of the municipality, NGOs, researchers and communities. Settlements 
selected as pilot studies will become sites of innovation and experimentation in informal 
settlement upgrading (eThekwini Municipality & PPT 2018).  
 
Datafication of development can play a role in achieving social and environmental 
transformation. However, it can also produce greater inequality  and social injustice due to 
Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
248 
 the power embedded in data processes: collection, production and use of data. Informal 
settlements represent the most unequal, precarious and vulnerable sites of human 
habitation or ‘a place to put your head’ (Quarry Road West Mapmaker pers comm 
14/08/2019), in cities in the South. They are also largely excluded from urban datafication 
processes. For data justice for development to be achieved where it matters the most, 
greater research and empirical testing of the datafication of informal settlements is 
required.  
 
 
10C. Methods  
 
Quarry Road West informal settlement is a precarious settlement, as it is located on the 
narrow floodplain of the Palmiet River adjacent to a major freeway and secondary roads 
(Figures 5 and 6). The sett lement is characterised by its poor living conditions, high levels of 
poverty, its lack of basic services and poor housing, and its vulnerability to multiple 
environmental and social risks, including flooding, poor drainage, illegal electricity, fire, 
disease and crime (Mazeka et al 2019; Williams et al 2019).

sections Mcondo 1, Mcondo 2, maMpondweni and maMsuthu, on the Palmiet River 
(Source: Mazeka et al 2019)  
 
Quarry Road West informal settlement is categorised as a ‘deferred relocation’ by the 
Human Settlements Unit, due the lack of availability of state -subsidised low cost housing in 
the city. It is located on a high risk site, the narrow floodplain of the Palmiet River, which is 
prone to flooding after storm events (Williams et al 2019). It will therefore be challenging to 
upgrad e the settlement in -situ. The settlement is well established, it has been in existence 
for over 32 years and it is not likely that it will be moved in its entirety in the near future, 
due to the large housing backlogs and slower delivery of formal low cost  housing in the city, 
as well as the resistance of the community to move to state -subsidised housing on the 
periphery of the city. Under the iQhaza Lethu project, the municipality is considering 
innovative approaches to addressing the environmental risk of  the site, to determine if in -
situ upgrading is possible, given the broad socio -economic benefits the location of the site 
offers its residents (Mazeka et al 2019; Sim et al 2019).  
 
The datafication project in Quarry Road West informal settlement forms par t of the Palmiet 
Catchment Rehabilitation Project . When the PCRP was established in 2014, the UKZN 
researchers argued, in their initial meetings with the eThekwini Water and Sanitation Unit 
(EWS) from eThekwini Municipality, that it was critical to co -prod uce knowledge on the 
catchment with community -based organisations using participatory approaches, if resilient 
and sustainable water and climate governance was to be built (Vogel et al 2016). From the 
Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
250 
 outset of the project, the UKZN researchers set about b uilding relations and constructing 
knowledge with the community of Quarry Road West informal settlement, to understand 
their relations with the Palmiet River. This knowledge production process is what is critically 
analysed in this case study, to explore t he extent to which it has achieved data justice.  
 
This case study was selected for analysis because data has been co -produced between the 
informal settlers and university researchers over a long period of time and hence there is a 
well-established data pro duction process or information value chain. This reveals the 
changing nature of data produced as issues in the settlement change and as researchers and 
community members build their capacity in collecting data in an informal space. Quarry 
Road West informa l settlement is exposed to high environmental risk, is politically and 
socially well organised and it displays high levels of social cohesion and identity, which 
makes it a good case study to explore data justice (Sim et al 2019). Perhaps what is most 
impo rtant, is that at the outset of the PCRP, state officials could not enter the settlement 
without high levels of security, due to the conflictual and confrontational relationship 
between the state and the informal settlers, as a result of a lack of trust on  both sides. By 
2016, a relationship between the state and citizens had been established and by 2018 
informal settlers were conducting river clean -ups in municipal uniforms funded by municipal 
supported co -operatives (see Figure 7). The relations between c itizens and the state had 
shifted as a result of procedural justice which opened up possibilities to build instrumental, 
structural, rights -based and distributive justice.

Interviews on the concept of data justice were conducted with four officials from the 
Human Settlements Unit, Environmental Planning and Climate Protection Department 
(EPCPD), Coastal Stormwater and Catchment Management Department in eThekwini 
Municipality  through action research in the PCRP. A focus group was held on 20 March 2019 
with 14 members of the mapmakers team from Quarry Road West informal settlement to 
explore the question of whether the data they have produced has achieved social and 
environment al transformation in the settlement. This was facilitated by Open Data Durban. 
The data and reports that have been produced for the PCRP, listed in Box 1, were critically 
evaluated on an ongoing basis between January 2019 and July 2019. This was undertaken  in 
meetings held in the community and at the university between the mapmakers, university 
researchers and municipal officials as they continued to engage in the work of upgrading the 
settlement and improving water and climate governance within it. The aut hors who have 
written this case study are the researchers involved in the datafication of Quarry Road West 
informal settlement. We therefore acknowledge our positionality in the project and the way 
in which this will have shaped the analysis presented here , as we are embedded 
researchers. The data justice model by Heeks & Shekhar (2019) is used as a framework to 
reflect on the information value chain that is emerging through the project and to critically 
analyse the datafication taking place in Quarry Road West informal settlement. This includes 
a reflection on how the datafication process has built state -citizen relations (structural and 
procedural justice), has helped to address challenges in the settlement (instrumental, 
procedural and structural justice)  and how it has supported the upgrading and 
transformation of the settlement to date (instrumental, procedural and rights -based 
justice).

 10D. Findings  
 
Mapmakers from Quarry Road West informal settlement have been co -producing data with 
a team of resear chers from UKZN since 2014 (see Box 1). However, life in the settlement 
remains precarious, and has become even more challenging after a major flood which 
devastated the settlement on 22 April, 2019. This raises questions about the value of the 
dataficatio n process in achieving development. Data has been collected, processed and 
produced through participatory knowledge production practices, in the upstream and 
midstream activities of the information value chain. Some data has moved downstream in 
the informa tion chain, to the spaces of decision making and implementation, largely 
through the efforts of ‘bridges’ or data intermediaries. Two university researchers, two 
municipal officials and three mapmakers, who have developed their skills in data 
presentation through the datafication project, have acted as the main ‘bridges’ in the 
project. These data intermediaries have actively sought opportunities to present, both 
individually and collectively, the data on the settlement in multiple platforms in the city.  
 
This activism, through the way in which the data has been constructed and presented to 
support progressive discourses on informality, has therefore played an important role in 
both moving the data along the information value chain, and in the form the embed ding of 
the data in the value chain takes. This includes presenting data in PCRP meetings, in 
international conferences held in the city that had a strong municipal presence (IAIA 2017), 
in stakeholder workshops for the development of Durban’s Resilient Ci ty (2016 -2017), in 
videos produced for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundations Re -Invent the Toilet Challenge 
(2018) for a global toilet fair in China in 2018, in the KwaZulu -Natal Province’s Climate 
Change Summit (14/08/2019), in municipal forums and meeti ngs held to address critical 
water, climate and housing issues in the city, and in events to showcase the data produced 
in the settlement, including the Narratives of Home photographic exhibition held in the 
settlement (21/03/2019). The data intermediaries  have therefore acted as ‘champions’ for 
informal settlement upgrading in the city through the datafication process being undertaken 
in Quarry Road West informal settlement. The role of champions is well recognised as being 
critical to just transformation and sustainable development (Roberts 2016).  
 
However, the extent to which the data has resulted in meaningful change in the settlement 
is questioned in a city grappling with informality. Some instrumental outcomes have 
emanated from the co -production of da ta. However, these outcomes relate more to 
changes in governance, shifts in discourses towards informal settlements and their ‘right to 
the city’, empowerment of the community and having their voices heard, and opportunities 
for engaging with the municipal ity in innovative projects, than tangible outcomes related to 
changes in the built environment of the settlement. In time, these may yield more 
substantive outcomes on the ground, such as the provision of improved services, most 
notably sanitation and stor mwater drainage, the reduction of the risk of the river to the 
community, the upgrading of the settlement, or even the relocation of the settlement in its 
entirety. These substantive outcomes require significant shifts in political will and bold 
governance  by the state. However, the ‘soft’ outcomes are important in creating 
institutional shifts, which can lead to social and environmental transformation. They 
therefore may be just as valuable over the longer term for development, as ‘hard’ outcomes 
reflected  in changes in the built environment. The knowledge that has been built has made Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
253 
 the settlement more ‘visible’ and this visibility has brought other actors and projects to the 
settlement, which has led to change both in the settlement, and in the instituti ons engaging 
with it (see Figure 10). However, these efforts are also being constrained by the broader 
political struggles around informality that are dominant in the municipality at present, both 
between political parties and within them. In most instance s, the changes in Quarry Road 
West informal settlement represent ‘little victories in the face of big defeats’, as the gains 
are small, and are often overwhelmed by the challenges and politics of living in an informal 
settlement in a city struggling to add ress and cope with increasing informality. However, 
they bring hope of change in the settlement, and it is this hope that motivates informal 
settlers to persevere in data collection processes (Open Data Workshop 21/03/2019).  
 
This case study analyses the v alue of datafication in two ways. It first presents the value of 
the data itself  in supporting social and environmental transformation in the settlement and 
reflects on the structural elements that constrain or enable the movement of data 
downstream in the  information value chain. Second, it reveals the value of the data 
production process  and the state -citizen -university relations it has built, in leading to change 
through data justice. The first section reflects on the data produced, which is multi -modal 
and in most cases is not the digital data of development informatics, but rather qualitative 
data that opens up opportunities for listening and learning (Kennedy et al 2019). The case 
study reveals that qualitative data produced at the local scale can play  a valuable role, along 
with quantitative and digital data, in making informal settlements more visible through ‘just’ 
datafication. This finding is supported by Kennedy et al’s (2019) case study on informational 
politics in Hyderabad and Chakraborty et al ’s (2015) and Willis’ (2017) research on 
community -based mapping.  
 
10D1. Valuing Different Forms of Data in Different Contexts for City 
Datafication  
Individuals and communities at the ‘bottom of the data pyramid’ (Arora 2016) are often 
excluded from big da ta, digital data and the datafication of the city. They do not always emit 
data, nor are they digitally captured or recorded as citizens in the same way as those that 
are connected to the global and national economy; to the benefits and services of formal 
city life; and to the dominant political and social networks of a particular society. Informal 
settlers find themselves on the periphery of city datafication, due to their particular 
histories and geographies, their informality, poverty and inequality, and  the way in which 
others who have power, construct their ‘place’ and ‘identity’ in the city.  
 
As the urban poor, they claim their ‘right to the city’ through illegal land invasions. They 
claim land, build their own housing and attempt to access basic servi ces. They seek 
representation and hence they organise themselves politically. However, they often remain 
invisible, due to the repressive discourses of informality in the city, which construct informal 
settlements as places to be removed, relocated or as p laces that are ‘not meant to be there’ 
or are ‘not known’ (Councillor 1 pers comm 23/04/2019). So how do informal settlers begin 
the process of being represented in the data of the city?  
 
An analysis of the data, maps and images co -produced by the mapmaker s and UKZN 
researchers from 2014 to 2019 on Quarry Road West informal settlement, reveals the wide 
range of data that has been collected, processed and more recently transferred into Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
254 
 decision -making spaces through ‘bridges’ or data intermediaries (Heeks & Shekhar 2019). 
The data ranges from creative, qualitative data to technical and digital data, collected and 
represented using participatory GIS. The different forms of data have travelled within and 
from the informal settlement outwards, and hence have pla yed a role in ensuring some 
level of data justice in the settlement, albeit in small ways. The types of data collected and 
the purpose of collecting the data was decided upon collaboratively, as the mapmakers and 
the university researchers explored both th e relationship between the informal settlers and 
the Palmiet River, and critical issues that emerged in the settlement, as the research 
partnership evolved. The role of different forms of data (see Table 1) in achieving some level 
of data justice and examp les of this data (see Figure 8) are presented below. Table 1 
describes the type of data collected and produced and the impact it has had, and it reflects 
on the type and level of data justice achieved.

 Develops a context of the settlement,

organisation of the settlement and its 
main characteristics and risks.  
Many informal settlements in South 
Africa are divided into sections that have 
historical, geographical and political 
meaning, and this is critical to 
understand in any development proce ss, 
but is often missed in interventions 
planned from ‘outside’ the settlement. 
Supports qualitative open -ended 
listening and dialogue about the 
settlement and its social, economic, 
environmental and political dimensions.  This form of data is valuable to d ata 
producers as it provides a platform 
upon which an understanding of the 
context of the settlement and other 
data is built. It is used in upstream 
activities. It supports procedural 
justice as the community constructs 
and provides the first baseline map 
of the settlement, setting the 
boundaries of and framing the 
datafication process at the outset.

settlement at a particular point in time. 
The settlement is mapped at the 
household scale, which protects 
residents against evictions, as their ‘right 
to the city’, enshrined in the South 
African Constitution and housing 
legislation, is recorded and spatially geo -
referenced on the map. The GIS map 
provides a tempor al record, which is 
critical in determining which residents 
have rights to the settlement after 
natural and human -induced disasters 
disrupt the settlement.  Procedural, instrumental, structural 
and rights -based justice is built 
through communities owning an d 
producing GIS maps of their 
settlement in partnership with 
university researchers. Community 
members decided which attributes 
were mapped for each household. 
Power relations are challenged as 
informal settlers, rather than only 
the municipality, hold dat a on the 
households in the settlement and 
their ‘right to the city’. The GIS 
maps have been used in legally 
challenging evictions, thereby 
protecting ‘mapped’ residents since 
2017.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88

 The multi -modal data collected and processed in Quarry Road West informal settlement 
reflects procedural justice and rights -based justice in terms of how it has been produced, as 
the community has ownership over the data construction process and over the data itself. 
The mapmakers’ frustration lies in how this data can move downstream and be used to 
transform their every day lived worlds, as they argue that they produce the data through 
their own civic duty, but then the data “gets stuck and does not change our lives” (Open 
Data Workshop 21/03/2019). The mapmakers have had to rely largely on ‘bridges’ or data 
intermediarie s to move the data downstream in the information value chain. The ‘bridges’ 
are all engaged in the PCRP and so are committed to the datafication process over the 
longer term. Except for one official, they have all been participants in the project for over 
five years. This has created institutional memory and strong partnerships, which have 
supported the advocacy role of the ‘bridges’, who have acted collectively to reduce risk and 
improve quality of life in the settlement. As a result, data developed from t he outset of the 
project continues to be transferred into various decision -making spaces within the 
municipality, which open up when the politics of the city allows this to happen. Having 
explored the different types of data collected and produced, the sec ond part of the results 
of this case study reflects on the value of the data production process, the relations it has 
built and the outcomes it has achieved.  
 
10D2. The Value of the Datafication Process  
The value of the datafication process is analysed by reflecting on the outcomes of the 
process, as it has evolved over time. Two phases are identified: the first phase, where the 
datafication process had a limited influence on instrumental, structural and distributive 
justice, and the second phase, where the  datafication process built on what was achieved in 
the first phase, and began to influence downstream activities, leading to potential 
instrumental, rights -based, structural and distributive justice.  
 
This became possible when the data began to flow into an innovative upgrading 
programme, iQhaza Lethu, in the municipal department with the most power to transform 
life in Quarry Road West: the Human Settlements Unit. While data had been presented to 
officials in this Unit in the first phase, it had had littl e impact as there was resistance to the 
data, with housing officials explaining that they had 556 settlements to deal with in the city, 
and so data at this ‘microscale’ and level of detail was not helpful to them. They also argued 
that it was unreliable as  informal settlements are dynamic and hence this data ‘would 
change all the time’. They argued that the informal settlers were registered with their 
housing numbers on the municipal database, and this is what they worked from. They also 
stated that Quarry Road West was a deferred relocation and hence they would not invest in 
upgrading efforts in the settlement (Human Settlements Unit Official pers comm 
04/07/2017).  
 
The major flood in the settlement in April 2019, also resulted in movement of the data 
downs tream in the information value chain, as the GIS mapping and evidence of ‘life in the 
settlement’ contained in the Narratives of Home Report (Sim et al 2019; see also Figure 10) 
became critical to protecting people’s rights to the settlement. Both iQhaza L ethu and the 
major flood, therefore acted as levers of change. A certain level of procedural justice was 
achieved in both phases, as data was produced by the community, based on their 
identification of data needs and transformed into development results. T his was in the form Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
258 
 of both ‘soft’ outcomes, focused on building knowledge, a governance arena, and capacity 
and power to act in the first phase, and downstream activities embedded in municipal, 
research and international projects in the second phase, whic h are starting to contribute to 
instrumental, structural, rights -based and distributive justice.  
 
Phase 1 of the datafication process  
 
The first phase of the datafication process, which took place between 2014 and 2017, 
emerged through the building of a re lationship between the mapmakers and the School of 
Built Environment and Development Studies (BEDS) researchers, with a focus on exploring 
the relationship between the community and the Palmiet River69. The datafication process 
was therefore initiated as p art of connected state -citizen -university action research 
projects: one part of the UEIP and the other two, national and internationally funded 
research projects located in BEDS, UKZN. The data that was produced during this phase 
included the community -based and GIS maps of the settlement (data types A and B, see 
Table 1 and Figure 8).  
 
The datafication process had a relatively small sphere of influence. The data was 
predominantly moved downstream into the PCRP, which focuses on building multi -
stakeholder a ction for improved water and climate governance in the Palmiet Catchment. 
The data was used to shape the Action Plan developed as part of the PCRP. It also played a 
critical role in illuminating the challenges and risks facing the Quarry Road West informal  
community in the catchment and their desire to participate in decision making affecting 
their ‘right to the city’. It therefore shifted both PCRP municipal and civic science actors’ 
views of informality, as a platform was created for community voices to b e heard. The data 
also began to travel into more significant epistemic and decision -making spaces, including 
committees and programmes in the municipality, largely through municipal champions. This 
led to ‘soft’ outcomes, such as raising awareness, questio ning of dominant repressive 
discourses on informality, and humanising informal settlers (see Figure 9).

 The initial decision to construct data in, and on, Quarry Road West informal settlement, was 
taken jointly by members of the informal community, led initially by an African National 
Congress (ANC) Branch Committee and sub -ward committee membe r, and university 
researchers70. The datafication process therefore started from the bottom up, using the 
political structures present in the settlement. The university researchers’ first meeting with 
the community was organised by EWS as part of the initiation of the PCRP, policed by 
undercover security, given the conflictual relationship between the state and citizens in the 
informal settlement prior to 2015. This conflictual relationship was due to poor service 
delivery, the threat of evictions and the community members’ desire to participate in 
decisions about their future, in the face of an interventionist and managerial local state 
(Sutherland et al 2018).  
 
The first meeting provided the researchers with an opportunity to explain the focus and 
purpose of the PCRP, namely improved water and climate governance across the 
catchment, by focusing on people’s relationship with the Palmiet River. The focus on the 
river attracted the interest of community members, as they have a close relationship with 
the river, which provides both benefits and risks to the community. Questions about how 
people relate to the river in the informal settlement did not initially trigger politics. This 
meant that the early processes of engagement were not thwarted by power stru ggles 
between political actors, including councillors, who wanted to control the process. The 
relations between the community and the river have since emerged as being highly political, 
particularly after the flood in April 2019, which has been part of the  learning in the PCRP. 
The researchers met regularly with the informal settlement committee after the first 
meeting, openly discussing the framing of a research agenda. Trust began to be established 
and discussions held about what the first data gathering exercise in the settlement should 
be. 
 
Exactly why and how this initial trust was established is difficult to determine. The team of 
researchers from UKZN, who have worked in other medium -sized informal settlements 
across the city over the past ten years, attribute the building of relationships to three 
factors. The willingness and desire of informal settlers to participate in the politics and 
transformation of urban life and to be made ‘visible’ and ‘known’; the openness of a 
participatory research process  which has inclusivity and the co -production of knowledge as 
its focus; and the continual ‘going -back’ of researchers to the settlement, to listen and learn. 
Informal settlers state that relationships are built because of the on -going engagement 
between th e community and the researchers; because of their desire to engage in and learn 
about knowledge production processes, an opportunity provided by the university; because 
they wish to be ‘made known’ and be recognised in the city; and because they want to ma ke 
a difference to the development trajectory of their settlement and their individual lives.  
 
Research projects offer a new space of learning and engagement, which is shaped by the 
politics of the settlement, but which is also not defined and controlled b y it. This was 
 
70 In 2014 when the project was initiated, Quarry Road West informal settlement was an ANC -led settlement in 
an ANC ward, Ward 23. In 2016  after the local government elections, the ward was won by the Democratic 
Alliance (DA) and is now a DA ward (2016 -2021), with the sub -committee in Quarry Road West informal 
settlement being DA led. The ANC still has a strong presence in the community and the representative 
councillor from the ANC, as well as the previous ANC councillor continue to engage with the community.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
261 
 evident in 2016 when the ward within which the settlement is located, changed from being 
an ANC -led ward to a Democratic Alliance (DA) -led ward, as a result of local government 
elections. This introduced an interesting dynamic, as the mapmak ers supported both 
political parties, as well as others. However, they agreed to work together, respecting their 
political identities, but not allowing them to define and control the datafication process. 
This outcome is extraordinary in the political land scape of South Africa, as it is not common 
for a group of people involved in a process as political as datafication, to be able to work 
across different political alliances. The social learning and relationships that had been built 
in the data production p rocess, has created a space of inclusiveness in the community, that 
has enabled the team of mapmakers to work together, cutting across not only political lines, 
but gender and age lines too.  
 
The data produced in Phase 1 remained largely an upstream and mi dstream activity (see 
Figure 9). Both community members and university researchers argued that the data had 
become stuck. It was not helping to change the living environment in the settlement, as it 
did not move easily into the spaces of decision making in  eThekwini Municipality, 
particularly the Human Settlements Unit and EWS, where the data potentially could have 
greatest impact. The data was presented and reported in the PCRP, of which EPCPD is a lead 
actor, and in which other municipal departments parti cipate. However, as an environmental 
planning and climate protection department, EPCPD is more of a facilitating and co -
ordinating agency, rather than an implementing agency of the local state and could 
therefore “not operationalise and invest in the eleme nts on the action plan, this was not 
what EPCPD does” (EPCPD Municipal Official pers comm 04/02/2019).  
 
The datafication of the settlement provided insight and learning about the settlement, 
which was shared by EPCPD officials in other municipal forums, bu t it did not lead to 
significant outcomes in terms of service delivery or changes in the built environment. The 
data supported the progressive discourses of the local state, in terms of informal settlement 
upgrading, and so it flowed easily into, and was t aken up in spaces where these discourses 
were evident. However, it was ‘blocked’ by the repressive discourses of some senior 
managers and departments in the municipality, in spaces where informal settlement 
upgrading was presented. However, an innovative c ity-wide programme located in EPCD, 
Durban’s 100 Resilient Cities journey, provided an opportunity for instrumental, rights -
based and structural justice. Data flowed downstream in 2016 and 2017, as the Quarry Road 
West informal settlers and university rese archers used the knowledge gained in the PCRP to 
provide input into the construction of Durban’s Resilience Strategy, which has a strong focus 
on collaborative informal settlement action in the city (eThekwini Municipality 2017; 
Sutherland et al 2019b).  
 
Phase 2 of the datafication process  
 
The second phase of the datafication process started in 2018, and is ongoing (data collected: 
types C, D and E, see Table 1 and Figure 8). As shown in Figure 10, a major breakthrough in 
the value of the datafication proc ess was achieved when the Human Settlements Unit, in 
partnership with Project Preparation Trust and Slum/Shack Dwellers International launched 
the iQhaza Lethu upgrading project, which is funded by the European Union. This opened 
the door for the data coll ected in the PCRP and Quarry Road West informal settlement to Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88  
262 
 flow downstream and to start shaping state policy and discourse within the Human 
Settlements Unit, as the unit began to explore options and practices for informal settlement 
upgrading based on a  partnership approach.  
 
However, this was dependent on two important factors: one of the ‘bridges’ or champions 
of the datafication process was placed in iQhaza Lethu in the Human Settlements Unit as an 
official; and a second ‘bridge’ influencing the iQhaz a Lethu programme, presented data 
from Quarry Road West informal settlement at initial planning meetings. The large amount 
of data that had been collected in the settlement, and hence the knowledge about it, as well 
as the influence of the data intermediar ies, resulted in Quarry Road West being selected as 
an iQhaza Lethu pilot project, even though it is an unlikely candidate for in -situ upgrading, 
being categorised by the municipality as a deferred relocation. iQhaza Lethu is building up 
knowledge on infor mal settlement upgrading and will shape policy and practice in the 
future, so the datafication of Quarry Road West informal settlement, will shape the 
discourses and practices of informal settlement upgrading in the city, leading to improved 
instrumental, rights -based and distributive justice.  
 
The data on the settlement is starting to flow into other spaces too, as the informal 
settlement has become the site of the implementation of a number of innovative projects in 
the municipality. This includes the Eng ineering Field Testing (EFT) being undertaken by EWS 
as part of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation’s Re -Invent the Toilet Challenge (RTTC) and 
the drafting of a Disaster Risk Management Plan, as part of the ‘EPIC A’ project, which is a 
learning partners hip between the municipality and the university. The choice of Quarry 
Road West informal settlement as a site for experimentation and social learning, through 
externally funded municipal projects, is attributed to the datafication of the settlement.  
 
The r ole of ‘bridges’ or data intermediaries, who promote the value of engaging with the 
settlement, due to the knowledge and capacity that exists within it, as well as the 
governance platform that supports it, is important. This represents a form of instrument al 
justice as the datafication of the settlement has led to the implementation of these different 
projects within the settlement. These in turn have begun to address development deficits, 
through for example, constructing development options for the upgrad ing of the 
settlement, and building a playground, as a result of the participation of the community in 
the EFT. The settlement was also selected as a case study for a research project funded by 
the National Research Foundation: Narratives of Home and Neigh bourhood: Possibilities for 
re-imagining Urban Planning.

 The in -depth data produced in this research project, which was made possible due to the 
strong relationships that exist between the mapmakers and the BEDS researchers as part of 
the datafication proce ss, has had a significant impact in a number of forums in the city, as it 
has humanised informal settlers for those that hold more repressive positions related to 
informality.  
 
A second event, the April 2019 flood, has created opportunities for the value o f the 
datafication process to emerge. It has also revealed how challenging it is for data to result in 
instrumental, structural and distributive justice in a city grappling with rising informality, 
which holds both progressive and repressive discourses tow ards informal settlements. The 
flood had a dramatic impact on the settlement, as both land and informal houses were lost. 
As a result of lack of meaningful disaster response from the state after the flood, informal 
residents began to rebuild houses on all remaining open space in the settlement. This 
prompted a response from the Land Invasions Unit in the municipality, who identified these 
houses as ‘new builds’ and hence activated their process of removing all ‘new builds’ as part 
of the policy of the Human  Settlements Unit. They placed red crosses on the doors of all the 
new builds, even though they had housing numbers on them, and warned residents that 
these houses would be taken down by the state. Residents, who were not newcomers after 
the flood, respond ed by stating that they had lived in the settlement for many years and 
had rebuilt on the open space, as they had lost their land in the flood. Housing officials told 
them they needed to provide evidence of this. The residents then activated the data, to 
claim their rights to the settlement. One resident, who is also a mapmaker, used the image 
of her household from the Narratives of Home research, to claim her right to the settlement 
(see Figure 11). She placed a copy of the image she took of her original h ouse (before the 
flood washed her home away), as part of the photovoice methodology in the Narratives of 
Home research, on the door of her ‘new build’, to protect herself from the actions of the 
Land Invasion Unit. This image is contained and referenced in  the Narratives of Home report 
(Sim et al 2019) and hence it has led to rights -based and instrumental justice for herself and 
her family. The GIS maps and database and the drone maps that have been flown of the 
settlement from June 2018 to July 2019 are al so being used by community members who 
lived in the settlement prior to the flood, to protect their right to land in Quarry Road West, 
as the response to the floods and the ‘new builds’ unfolds.

Residents of Quarry Road West informal settlement adopted two strategies in the aftermath 
of the floods: the one was to protest and the other was to present a memorandum of 
demands to the Deputy M ayor of the Municipality. This memorandum stated that the 
community wanted to work in partnership with the municipality, drawing on the data and 
knowledge they have of their settlement, partly as a result of the datafication process, to 
plan a future for t heir community, that addresses the impact of the flood and reduces the 
risk of the river on the settlement in the future.  
 
Protest action resulted in the Deputy Mayor visiting the settlement. She asked the 
community not to protest and rather to present a m emorandum to the city, by delivering it 
to her office. Protest always achieves an immediate reaction from politicians and senior 
officials, although it seldom leads to longer term action and change. The community, 
through a participatory political process,  drafted a memorandum, drawing on the 
datafication process, and submitted this to the Deputy Mayor. To date (August 2019) there 
has been no response to the memorandum, but this is most likely due to the recent 
replacement of the Mayor and the Deputy Mayor and executive committee of the 
municipality, due to corruption charges, which has led to significant political changes at the 
senior level. This political crisis has therefore impacted on the efforts of the Quarry Road 
West informal community to engage wit h the city. Bigger political struggles therefore play a 
major role in how data is taken up in downstream activities.

 10E. Discussion and Conclusions  
 
The datafication process in Quarry Road West informal settlement has made the settlement 
more ‘visible’ to the informal settlers who live within it. They state that they have learnt 
more about the place they live in and how it is shaped by its social, economic, 
environmental and political context. They have also improved their understanding of the 
mandates and capacity of local government and the limitations that it faces in meeting the 
needs of the urban poor (Open Data Workshop 21/03/2019). The settlement has also been 
made more ‘visible’ to the BEDS researchers, who are engaged in learning and kn owledge 
production processes on how to govern for social and environmental transformation in 
informal settlements in cities in the global South; and to the state, which is tasked with 
managing the ongoing challenge of the growth of informal settlements in Durban, while 
trying to build urban resilience and sustainability. Over time, the datafication process has 
expanded the reach and influence of the settlement in city politics and decision making 
around informality, but this reach and influence is yet to ha ve significant impacts on the 
everyday lives of those who live there and on the discourses and politics of informal 
settlement upgrading in the city. It has supported and strengthened a new governance 
arena that has emerged through the PCRP, which includes  state, university and civil society 
actors, which may lead to instrumental and structural justice in the future, as a platform for 
dialogue and change has been built. The platform is perceived as being legitimate and 
having influence by a wide range of ac tors both within and outside of the state, because it is 
underpinned by multi -modal data and knowledge and this gives it power.  
 
The case study has revealed that it is the coming together of actors, data, and opportunities 
or windows for change, at particu lar moments in time, in the life and politics of the city, 
which leads to some level of data justice for development. It is also evident that datafication 
has supported procedural and rights -based justice due to the epistemic control the 
mapmakers have had  of the data produced within the settlement (see Figure 12). A critical 
question in the datafication process is whether the mapmakers are accepted by the broader 
community as trustworthy data producers and data intermediaries. While some community 
members have raised issues around how the mapmakers benefit from the datafication 
process, which in some instances has included small stipends, it has been evident 
throughout the project that they are trusted in this position in the community. This was 
most clear when they engaged in the highly political process of collecting data on 
households in the settlement for the participatory GIS mapping project. The mapmakers 
mapped the settlement in a very short period of time, they were assisted by community 
members who all wanted to be part of the process and they encountered no resistance to 
the process they were undertaking (Mazeka et al 2019). Thus far, they are respected and 
trusted as researchers in the community (Open Data Workshop 21/03/2019). However, the 
politic al struggles over land that have emerged as a result of the flood, with newcomers 
moving into the settlement, has begun to create tension over the meaning and use of the 
data.  
 
It is also evident from the case study that trust cannot be taken for granted, that it can be 
broken very quickly, and that the politics in the settlement can change, shifting or breaking 
down relationships between the state, citizens and university researchers. This tension is 
beginning to emerge, as a result of the significant impa ct of the April floods on the Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88

 settlement and the land crisis this has evoked. Trust is essential in ensuring procedural 
justice, as it relates to ethics in data production, respect for different forms of knowledge, 
the ownership and control of knowledge, a nd the willingness and faith to allow others to act 
as ‘bridges’, data intermediaries and champions, to move data downstream in the 
information value chain.

Heeks & Sh ekhar 2019)  
 
Forms of instrumental and structural justice are beginning to emerge, with these two forms 
of justice being connected. The research has shown that it is very difficult to obtain ‘hard’ 
outcomes in the settlement without there being significant  changes in the structures of the 
city, which result in more progressive discourses, planning for and investment in, informal 
settlements. However, ‘bridges’ or data intermediaries have played a positive role here, and 
have ensured that the ‘soft’ outcomes  of the datafication process, including the building of a 
governance arena, social learning and opportunities that are created to shift conceptions of 
informality in the city, have gained traction and made a difference.  
 
Governing for data justice has emer ged as being critical to advancing data justice for 
development as this case study has shown and hence Heeks & Shekhar’s (2019) model has 
been expanded to include governance as a critical element. Perhaps the most critical aspect 
of governing for data just ice, is the relations built between the state and citizens, with 
researchers (or NGOs) acting as ‘bridges’ to support the building of these relationships and 
the movement of data downstream between citizens and the state. The impact and role of 
triggers or  opportunities for change created by ‘critical moments or events’ such as a flood 
or a major protest, is also recognised as a result of the research undertaken in Quarry Road 
West informal settlement.  
 
The case study has “gone beyond ‘justice as a set of theoretical principles’ to ‘justice -in-
practice’” (Heeks & Renken, 2018: 96). The final section presents the main lessons of the 
project and the recommendations that emerge from these lessons.

 10E1. Recommendations  
• Building state -citizen relations is criti cal in supporting data justice for development.  
• Qualitative and GIS data that is collected and produced at the local scale, can, with 
the support of data intermediaries and champions, move downstream into the 
decision -making spaces of the state. This form of data, when collected, produced 
and presented using established and rigorous research processes, is powerful in 
shifting conceptions and discourses on informality.  
• Building trust and ensuring respect for all actors in the knowledge production 
process, an d the different forms of knowledge they produce, is critical to data justice 
for development.  
• Datafication, when undertaken in inclusionary spaces that are defined by all actors in 
the process, can enable people to work across political, gender and age bou ndaries, 
moving development beyond the ‘gains’ of party politics or a particular group’s 
interests.  
• Datafication in an informal settlement makes the settlement visible to the informal 
settlers, to the state and to researchers and NGOs, providing new perspe ctives on 
how development can unfold and who needs to engage in the development process.  
• Informal settlers are empowered in terms of their ‘rights to the city’ when they hold 
data on the number of households and their characteristics in the settlement.  
• Datafication processes produce data, but often the ‘governance and knowledge 
platforms’ created through the process of inclusive datafication are more powerful 
than the data itself in achieving transformation. These platforms consist of: 
epistemics (what all parties have learned about each other) and social relations (the 
formation of a new social structure). It is these, rather than the data per se, that 
form the basis for impacts and interventions.  
• The datafication project, rather than the data produced dire ctly in the project, has 
led to some shifts of power in the relations between citizens and the state.  
• Data produced through participatory processes are time consuming and rely on 
committed relationships to see the process through. This effort and commitmen t is 
undermined when data does not move downstream in the information value chain. 
Here data becomes ‘stuck’ and actors involved in the process question why they are 
collecting and producing data, if the conditions of their everyday lives do not change. 
Only when this data enters the spaces of powerful actors in the state, when the state 
sets the agenda to engage with the data as it serves their interests, does change 
begin to happen and the data becomes meaningful in terms of what it may achieve 
in shifts in policy and practice in informal settlements. The powerful actors in the 
state therefore hold the most power in producing tangible ‘built environment’ 
outcomes from datafication processes.  
• Datafication when it is inclusive and builds procedural, rights -based, instrumental, 
structural and distributive justice supports ‘the right to the city’ which is “the right to 
the city is, therefore, far more than a right of individual access to the resources that 
the city embodies: it is a right to change ourselves by  changing the city more after 
our heart’s desire. It is, moreover, a collective rather than an individual right since 
changing the city inevitably depends upon the exercise of a collective power over the 
processes of urbanization. The freedom to make and r emake ourselves and our cities 
is, I want to argue, one of the most precious yet most neglected of our human 
rights” (Harvey 2008: 1).  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88

 10E2. Future Research Agenda  
This case study has explored the extent to which a well -established research partnership, 
between researchers within a university and ‘mapmakers’ from an informal settlement in 
Durban, has produced data that has made informal settlements more ‘visible’ to a wide 
range of state and non -state actors in the city, and achieved some level of social a nd 
environmental transformation. The instrumental and structural justice outcomes of the data 
process are only just beginning to emerge. It is therefore important to undertake a similar 
reflection, or case study, in three years, to reflect on whether, and how, life has changed for 
the residents in Quarry Road West informal settlement as a result of the datafication 
process, drawing on concepts from a data justice framework, which also will have evolved. It 
is also important to determine whether big data or digital data becomes more prominent in 
the settlement over time, and what form the ‘datafication of development’ takes. Will 
informal settlements remain in the more marginalised space of community -produced data? 
This data is valuable, as this case study ha s shown, but it is often neglected and not 
recognised in decision making; it is time consuming to produce; and it relies on significant 
effort from the community, data champions and data intermediaries. Or will big data, digital 
data and the new forms of d ata streams being produced, which support those connected in 
to the formal systems of the city, begin to reach into, or become accessible to informal 
settlements, thereby connecting informal settlers to broader ‘datafication for development’ 
processes (Hee ks & Shekhar 2019; Spratt & Baker 2015; Taylor & Broeders 2015).  
 
Based on the results of this case study, it is evident that a future research agenda should 
include a focus on governance. How is data governed or ‘steered’ and who has the power to 
govern i ts ‘outcomes’? This could include an analysis of the different forms of 
‘governmentality’ of data for development.  Future research needs to determine what form 
of governance and institutions provides the best support for data produced, to ensure it 
moves according to just principles, down the information value chain and impacts on 
decision making. What sets of rules, norms and social values, in terms of both formal and 
informal institutions, act as levers of change for data justice for development? Should data 
be governed through multi -actor partnerships? What is the role of the state in ensuring that 
procedural, instrumental, rights -based, structural and distributive justice is achieved? What 
kind of state can ensure this? As this case study has shown, dat a becomes stuck, when it 
remains outside of the critical decision -making and implementing agencies of the state.  
 
Change in informal settlements, in terms of state interventions, is a slow process, given the 
regulations, bureaucratic and decision -making p rocesses of the state. However, change, in 
terms of the shocks and stresses faced by informal settlements and their ability to adapt to 
them, are far more rapid, as informal settlements are dynamic environments that never 
‘stand still’. Data collection and  production, when undertaken by informal settlers in 
partnership with universities, is a relatively quick process when human and financial 
resources are available. Further research needs to be undertaken on levers of change that 
can be activated to move da ta down the information value chain more quickly, and can 
ensure a more responsive, adaptive and flexible state, that can act on data produced at the 
local scale, and which is ‘smart’ enough to be able to ‘read this data’ and scale it up, and 
apply it to o ther informal settlements across this city, with a commitment to ‘data justice for 
development’, while not losing site of the importance of context. A big challenge, but one 
that is required and is essential, to ensure the rights of informal settlers to th e city.  Manchester Centre for Develop ment Inform atics Working Paper 88
