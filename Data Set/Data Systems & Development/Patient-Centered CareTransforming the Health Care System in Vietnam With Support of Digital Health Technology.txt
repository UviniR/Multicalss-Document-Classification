Abstr act
Backgr ound: Over the recent decades, Vietnam has attained remarkable achie vements in all areas of health care. However,
shortcomings including health disparities persist particularly with a rapidly aging population. This has resulted in a shift in the
disease burden from communicable to noncommunicable diseases such as dementia, cancer , and diabetes. These medical conditions
require long-term care, which causes an accelerating crisis for the health sector and society . The current health care system in
Vietnam is unlik ely to cope with these challenges.
Objecti ve: The aim of this paper was to explore the opportunities, challenges, and necessary conditions for Vietnam in
transforming toward a patient-centered care model to produce better health for people and reduce health care costs.
Methods: We examine the applicability of a personalized and integrated Bespok e Health Care System (BHS) for Vietnam using
a strength, weakness, opportunity , and threat analysis and examining the successes or failures of digital health care innovations
in Vietnam. We then make suggestions for successful adoption of the BHS model in Vietnam.
Results: The BHS model of patient-centered care empo wers patients to become active participants in their own health care.
Vietnam’ s current polic y, social, technological, and economic environment favors the transition of its health care system toward
the BHS model. Nevertheless, the country is in an early stage of health care digitalization. The legal and regulatory system to
protect patient privacy and information security is still lacking. The readiness to implement electronic medical records, a core
element of the BHS, varies across health providers and clinical practices. The scarcity of empirical evidence and evaluation
regarding the effectiveness and sustainability of digital health initiati ves is an obstacle to the Vietnamese government in
polic ymaking, development, and implementation of health care digitalization.
Conclusions: Implementing a personalized and integrated health care system may help Vietnam to address health care needs,
reduce pressure on the health care system and society , impro ve health care delivery, and promote health equity . However, in

Introduction
Overview
Following broad economic reforms known as Doi Moi in 1986,
Vietnam has attained remarkable health care impro vement,
reflected in core health indicators [1]. From 1988 to 2018, life
expectanc y at birth increased from 69.9 years to 75.3 years,
under -5 mortality rate decreased from 56‰ to 20.7‰, and infant
mortality reduced from 39.6‰ to 16.5‰ [2]. Health care
expenditure gradually increased and was forecasted to triple
from US $15.6 billion in 2018 to US $42.9 billion in 2028 [3].
Despite these impro vements, the health care system still faces
signif icant challenges including wide disparities in health and
growing health care costs. The disparities in core health
indicators are particularly observ ed between urban and rural
residents, across different regions, and among population groups
[4]. For example, the maternal mortality ratio and infant
mortality rate in some mountainous areas are 3 to 4 times higher
than those in lowland and urban areas and almost double the
national average rates [4].
Vietnam is under going a dramatic demographic transition
resulting in an aging population. The number of people aged
65 years and over is estimated to increase from 10% of the
population in 2015 to 28% in 2050 [5]. The combination of an
aging population, increased industrialization, and changes in
population lifestyle have created a double disease burden, with
a shift from communicable to noncommunicable diseases
(NCDs). Specif ically , the mortality rate caused by NCDs rose
from 45.5% in 2010 to 77% in 2016 and is projected to climb
[3,4,6]. The double disease burden means that Vietnam is facing
more costly health conditions such as dementia, cancer , andmultimorbidity . In addition to this, the country still faces
signif icant burden of infectious conditions and a number of new
epidemics such as COVID-19. These health challenges must
be addressed using a systemic approach by the whole
government of Vietnam to impro ve health for its population.
To impro ve health care problems and the health status of the
population, there is a critical need for a well-functioning health
care system that can deliver services equitably and efficiently
[7]. The World Health Organization (WHO) developed an
evidence-based building blocks frame work as a tool to help its
member states analyze their health care systems. This frame work
allows nations to consider the multif aceted nature of their health
systems and interdisciplinary and multile vel responsibility in
health care [7]. The WHO frame work assesses health systems
using 6 core components or building blocks. Each building
block and its indicators were initiated by a group of agenc y
representati ves and technical experts, shared broadly with
country experts, and followed by evaluations through a series
of case studies and reviews of country experiences [7]. These
components focus on the key chains of the monitoring and
evaluation frame work developed by the International Health
Partnership, namely inputs, processes, and outputs [8]. The
relation between the 6 building blocks and this monitoring and
evaluation frame work is summarized in Figure 1. In the
following section, the 6 building blocks and corresponding
indicators are used to describe Vietnam’ s health care system,
comprising financing and health workforce components (inputs
and processes), medical products, technologies, and service
delivery components (immediate outputs), and cross-cutting
components: leadership/go vernance and health information
systems [7].

RenderXHealth Care System in Vietnam
Health Financing
Health financing is a key building block in a national health
system, largely influencing the inputs, thus affecting the
availability , affordability , and accessibility of health services.
A good health financing system should move toward universal
health coverage, where all people have access to needed health
services without financial hardship. This could be achie ved
through increasing total health expenditure (THE) and
decreasing the proportion of households facing financial
catastrophe as a result of out-of-pock et payments (OPP) [7].
With multiple health financing reforms, Vietnam’ s THE per
capita increased from US $14 in 1995 to US $113 in 2014
[9,10], thus within the internationally defined range and enough
for universal coverage of key health interv entions [7]. The
increase in public health expenditure (mainly comprising state
budget [11] and social health insurance [12]) has increased
health care coverage for some groups including the poor, ethnic
minorities, under–6-year -old children, over–80-year -old people,
and socially vulnerable groups through the government’ s
subsidized schemes [13]. However, patient OPP remained high,
accounting for 40.8% of THE in 2015, which was higher than
that of other countries in the Asia Pacific region and the WHO
recommended level [10,11]. The high OPP led to catastrophic
expenditure and pushed many Vietnamese families into poverty,
resulting in health care inequity [14,15]. The current model of
the health care system and financing needs further reforms to
address a surge in health care expenditure caused by the aging
population and shifting disease pattern in Vietnam.
Health Workforce
The health workforce is another key building block to provide
inputs and processes to the monitoring and evaluation chain of
health systems. The ability of a country to meet its health goals
largely depends on people in charge of organizing and delivering
health services. Evidence of the direct and positi ve link between
numbers of health workers and population health outcomes has
been demonstrated in several studies [16,17].
The health workforce in Vietnam has gradually impro ved in
both quantity and quality . The number of doctors and
pharmacists increased from 7.2 and 1.76 per 10,000 people in
2010 to 8.0 and 2.2 per 10,000 people in 2015, respecti vely [4].
In 2015, 65% to 95% of the health facilities and about 90% of
the health workers in hospitals at central and provincial levels
were licensed [4]. Despite this signif icant impro vement,
Vietnam’ s health workforce was still insuf ficient to meet staffing
norms and clinical needs [4] and inappropriately distrib uted
across regions and levels/areas of care. The aging population
and shifting disease burden to those requiring long-term care
for chronic NCDs are likely to lead to severe shortages in health
resources, which occur in highly specialized fields such as
cancer , palliati ve care, and mental health and in hard-to-reach
areas such as North West, Central highlands, and Mekong Delta
regions [4,18-20]. The mountainous and remote areas lack not
only specialists trained in advanced diagnostic and treatment
approaches but also standard medical and diagnostic equipment,
which diminishes the quality of health care services in theseareas compared to urban regions [4]. This wide disparity in
health care between the rich and the poor, urban and rural, is
demonstrated in the disparity of core health indicators such as
life expectanc y at birth and infant and under -5 mortality rates
[4].
Overcro wding in health facilities, especially in urban and
specialized hospitals, is a main cause of health worker
exhaustion. Nearly one-f ifth of Vietnamese clinical nurses
experienced burnout and occupational stress [21]. Clinician
burnout directly reduces the quality of life of clinicians and
adversely affects the quality of care to patients. It also indirectly
contrib utes to the reduction of health staffing [22]. Hence, a
vicious negative cycle for Vietnam’ s health sector is created.
Health Service Deliv ery
Health service delivery is reflected in the availability and
readiness of services across the health care continuum. Vietnam
has achie ved signif icant service impro vement in health care:
for example, the ratio of hospital beds per 10,000 people
increased from 21.5 in 2011 to 24.0 in 2015 [4]. The hospital
quality management system was established in 2013 and
available in 55.4% of hospitals throughout the country in 2015
[23].
Service provision is immediate outputs of the inputs into the
health system such as financing, workforce, procurement, and
supplies [7]. It will be difficult to achie ve the outputs if the
inputs are insuf ficient. Even if the inputs are adequate, whether
the outputs are obtained depends very much on the efficienc y
of the health system’ s functioning. According to Bentle y et al
[24], there are 4 key inefficiencies: duplication of services,
inefficient processes, overly expensi ve inputs, and medical
errors. All of these forms of inefficienc y occur in Vietnam’ s
health sector .
Vietnamese patients’ laboratory tests and results are not usually
archi ved at medical facilities or shared between different health
care providers. This poses a challenge as patients experience
multiple visits to doctors and specialists for the same health
conditions thus leading to duplication of services [3]. Public
hospitals, especially in large cities, are usually overcro wded
with 2 to 3 patients sharing a bed. Limited quality of health care
services at the commune level leads to reduced patient trust in
primary care. Also, if patients use OPP, the health care system
allows them to easily bypass lower level facilities (eg, commune
health stations) and seek health care services in leading tertiary
hospitals in big cities without referrals (ie, inefficient processes),
even just to treat common diseases that primary care is well
equipped to manage (ie, overly expensi ve inputs) [4,25].
Consequently , higher level hospitals are drained of resources,
while there is waste at lower levels due to underuse [26].
Overcro wding in high-le vel health facilities is associated with
medication errors. A large prospecti ve study in two urban
hospitals in Vietnam revealed that medication errors occurred
in more than one-third of all medication doses [27].
There are also discrepancies in health service readiness and
quality across areas of health care. Vietnam has an extensi ve
primary health care system that reaches almost every
administrati ve jurisdiction and acts as the main entry point to
J Med Internet Res 2021 | vol. 23 | iss. 6 | e24601 | p. 3 https://www .jmir.org/2021/6/e24601

XSL•FO
RenderXpublic health care. However, grassroots level facilities have
inadequate infrastructure required for basic health care delivery.
For example, only 76% of commune health stations in Dien
Bien province (a Northern mountainous province) have a source
of clean water, and a signif icant number of district hospitals
lack essential equipment such as child ventilators and
electrocardiograms [28]. Also, there have been increasing
concerns about the equity and quality of basic health service
provisions in primary health care. These limitations were
reflected in key health indicators, with the infant mortality rate
among the ethnic minority population being over 4 times higher
than that of Kinh and Hoa ethnic groups, who mostly live in
urban areas [28].
Access to Essential Medicines
According to WHO, a well-functioning health system should
be able to provide the population it serves with equitable and
affordable access to essential medicines, medical products, and
technologies and use this resource efficiently [7]. However,
published literature consistently reported that medicine prices
in Vietnam were high and unaffordable for many Vietnamese
people [29-31]. A fragmented medical information system
within and between health care and other sectors such as General
Department of Vietnam Customs and Ministry of Finance, as
well as a shortage of personnel and resources for enforcing
medicine pricing policies was one of the reasons for their high
price in Vietnam [32]. Because of high medicine prices,
irrational selection and use of medicines, unsustainable
pharmaceutical production and distrib ution systems, and a lack
of financial support systems for medicine procurement, access
to the right medicines at the times people need them remains a
major challenge for the majority of the Vietnamese people
[33-37].
Health Information
The health information system (HIS) is a crosscutting building
block because it creates a foundation for all decision-making
processes in a health system. Vietnam has achie ved signif icant
progress in this area. A number of health statistics are generated
annually: for example, the Annual Health Statistic Yearbook,
Joint Annual Health Review, and Statistical Yearbook.
Information technology is applied widely in the health
administration and management of all 63 provinces and cities
across the country . Vietnam is also strongly promoting the
development of a health management database for its over 90
million citizens [4].
Vietnam’ s HIS, however, still faces a number of issues and
challenges, including data generation, validation, and uses. For
example, data from health care facilities, especially from private
and industrial sectors, are neither timely nor complete.
Information from local death registration is incompatible with
WHO recommendations. There are discrepancies in the quality
of medical records across regions and levels of care, which
creates challenges for continuing health monitoring, disease
prevention and treatment, and management of medical errors
and adverse drug reactions. Even after the data are collected,
the unclear data dissemination mechanism in Vietnam will likely
restrict data use [4]. Given the importance of this crosscutting
building block of the health system, reform is needed to operateHIS more effectively, especially in the new era of information
technology .
Leadership and Governance
Health leadership and governance is another crosscutting
building block in a health care system. It mediates other building
blocks by connecting all issues surrounding the accountability
of various stakeholders in the system to ensure adequate
resources (finance, workforce, medical supplies, and
information) are available to deliver essential health services.
In terms of health care governance, Vietnam has attained
remarkable progress, demonstrated in the development of a
strong polic y frame work in health care. The enactment of
important laws and policies, such as health insurance and
pharmac y laws [38,39], and the Health Sector Strate gy for
2011-2020 with a Vision to 2030 [40] provided a solid
foundation and led to the formation of regulations, guidelines,
initiati ves, and plans in these areas. The organizational structure
of Vietnam’ s health system has been adjusting to meet health
care needs at various levels, such as establishing information
technology administration at central levels and formally
affirming the function and tasks of community health services
at local levels [4]. Nevertheless, health policies in Vietnam are
sometimes overlap, inconsistent and lack evidence. Lack of
detailed plans and information cause difficulty for the effective
implementation of policies. Additionally , insuf ficient sanctions
and a weak inspection netw ork for polic y enforcement are also
shortcomings of Vietnam’ s health care governance [4].
In summary , Vietnam has attained signif icant achie vement and
impro vement in all 6 areas of the health system frame work.
However, shortcomings persist. To address all these systemic
challenges and achie ve optimal and equitable health outcomes
for the population, the Vietnamese government must consider
adapting the current model of health care operation to meet
rapidly changing population trends, patterns of disease, and
health care needs and use existing resources more efficiently
while impro ving health infrastructure. The application of digital
health technologies to underpin the health care system
transformation is critical to success [41]. “The use and scale-up
of digital health solutions can revolutionize how people
worldwide achie ve higher standards of health and access
services to promote and protect their health and well-being”
[42]. As in many other countries, Vietnam’ s health care system
will need to be migrated to the patient-centered care model,
which focuses on patients and their particular health care needs,
and patients will need to be empo wered to become active
participants in their care to optimize health and economic
outcomes [43]. This study was conducted to explore the
opportunities, challenges, and necessary conditions for Vietnam
in transforming toward a patient-centered care model to produce
better health for people and reduce health care costs.
Methods
Approach
In this paper , we explored a Bespok e Health Care System (BHS)
developed by Schof ield et al [44] as an ideal example of a
comprehensi ve patient-centric care model. The current
Vietnamese digital health and health care landscape was

RenderXexamined using a strength, weakness, opportunity , and threat
(SWOT) analysis to argue for the potential of developing a BHS
in Vietnam. We then discuss necessary and sufficient conditions
and challenges for Vietnam in transforming toward this
patient-centered care model to produce better health for people
and reduce health care costs.
Bespok e Health Care System
In 2019, Schof ield et al [44] first introduced the concept of the
BHS in the conte xt of Australian health care, which has been
adapted to other conte xts [45,46]. The development of the BHS
was based on the pedagogical model of flipping the classroom
in modern education [47] and its application in health care [48].
In Australia, this approach has been applied by many health
professionals [47]. Patients were equipped with necessary
knowledge before consultations. Therefore, the consultation
time was effectively used to solve health problems and make
joint decisions [47]. The core component of the BHS is
“increasing patient involvement in health care decisions and
self-management assisted by the use of technology” [49]. In
this model, patients will be educated about their illness and
management options, flipping their role from passengers to
drivers to manage their own health care, with clinicians playing
more of a support role being the “guide by the side.” Although
the BHS was proposed as an ideal comprehensi ve patient-centric
care system with several advantages and benef its, there is no
one-size-f its-all approach. Novel health care solutions will work
best when they are adapted to suit a country’ s specif ic conditions
and have broad-based acceptance among the community , health
care providers, and government agencies.
SWOT Analysis
The SWOT analysis has been used widely in polic y research to
provide polic y makers with a sound basis for strate gy
development and formulation and identify new avenues for
national health care reform [50]. The technique examines 4
parameters: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
In this paper , strengths and weaknesses refer to internal factors
of the proposed BHS that place it at an advantage or
disadv antage over the current Vietnamese health care system,
respecti vely. Opportunities and threats refer to external factors
to the BHS that support or prevent it from being adopted in
Vietnam.
Results
Strengths
The BHS brings a number of potential benef its to a health care
system. First, the BHS proposes integrating electronic medical
records (EMRs) into a patient-centered management platform.
Currently , EMRs act as passi ve information depositories mainly
for the purposes of health data storage or analysis. In the
proposed BHS, every person would have their EMR containing
all relevant personal and medical information that is shared
across health care providers. As such, relevant health workers
and agencies would have access to patients’ real-time health
information, saving time in managing people’ s health, saving
costs of unnecessary or duplicated examinations and laboratory
tests, and reducing medication errors. Studies have revealedthat one-f ifth of medical errors were due to insuf ficient patient
medication information [48,51]. Clinical access to patients’
real-time health information would enable tailored precision
and holistic health solutions for individuals.
Second, the BHS proposes that the EMR is an active tool in
promoting optimal health management. The proposed platform
would remotely track symptoms, prompt patients to perform
routine screening tests, allow patients to book medical
appointments and remind them to attend, and provide scheduled
reminders for adherence to medical recommendations. Electronic
prompts and reminder alerts have been shown to assist
individuals in adhering to clinical interv ention effectively,
particularly in managing long-term chronic conditions [49].
Third, the BHS serves as an education platform, upskilling
patients and health workers. In the BHS, patients would
optimally be equipped with a comprehensi ve understanding of
their conditions, treatment options, and self-management
strate gies. This is an effective way to empo wer people to have
greater ownership in managing their health. Additionally ,
clinicians would be provided with up-to-date, evidence-based
optimal health care pathw ays suitable for their specif ic patients’
conditions. This offers an ongoing mechanism to support
clinicians’ continuing professional development using their own
case studies. Moreo ver, the platform might be used to upskill
patient families and carers, which would strengthen community
care and lessen the health care burden due to staff shortages
[51]. Potentially , the BHS would facilitate reducing the health
inequities in terms of accessing optimal health care, particularly
for the economically disadv antaged or those living in remote
areas.
In summary , adopting the BHS model may assist Vietnam in
addressing the health crisis and achie ving the country’ s health
care goals in the new decade. This model can increase patient
accessibility to health care facilities and state-of-the-art health
management, including the most vulnerable and hard-to-reach
people, thus enhancing health equity across the country . It can
also increase operational efficiencies for both health care
providers and users, resulting in lessening overcro wded hospitals
and enabling coordinated health care, which is currently missing
[3,52]. Moreo ver, digital solutions can assist teaching, tertiary ,
or specialized hospitals to deliver training or conduct eHealth
consultations with satellite, primary , or secondary hospitals.
Therefore, the quality of health care would be strengthened
across the country .
Weaknesses
Although the BHS model has many strengths, we need to
articulate inherent weaknesses in the model. First, the high cost
and comple xity of implementing digital health information
systems, such as EMRs, may be a barrier to broad dissemination.
Second, the digitalization of data and services represents a
potential cybersecurity threat to privacy and trust of people in
a new health care system [3]. Finally , the establishment of
nationwide unique health IDs (unique codes used to identify
individuals within the health care system) often takes time,
especially for socially disadv antaged members of the
community .

RenderXOpportunities
Vietnam has a high-le vel polic y frame work (ie, political and
legal environment) supporting the transition toward the BHS.
The 2017 Resolution 20-NQ/TW of the Communist Party of
Vietnam has provided a strate gic orientation for reforming the
health care system. This includes systemic implementation of
information technology in management of primary health care,
prevention, disease management, and the establishment of
electronic health records (EHRs) for all citizens that link to their
health insurance card.
Based on this strate gic orientation, the Vietnamese Ministry of
Health (MOH) in 2017 set out national goals for the protection,
care, and impro vement of people’ s health in the period to 2030.
One of the 5 key priorities for action to achie ve the national
health care goals was developing human resources, medical
sciences, and technology [4,53]. Since then, a national agenda
for digitalization of the health care system has been driven by
MOH with a number of initiati ves that aim to adopt digital
solutions in health care netw ork across the country . Vietnam is
rapidly embracing digital health. Digitalized health care is
percei ved as a useful solution that could help to address the
rapidly growing gap between service demand and capacity [44].
To implement health care digitalization, MOH issued Circular
54/2017/TT -BYT regarding assessment criteria for information
technology applications in health care facilities [50] and a plan
to develop smart health care during the period 2018-2025, with
a vision toward 2030 [54]. In this plan, targeted smart health
outcomes were specif ied, such as development of a national
health care data center , electronic health and medical records,
and electronic government and smart medicine management
systems. Particularly in the field of examination and treatment,
telemedicine is regulated by Circular 49/2017/TT -BYT , which
provides guidelines for a range of telemedicine consultations
in Vietnam (eg, allowing doctors to provide telemedicine
services to patients under certain infrastructure requirements
[55]).
To accelerate the application of information technology in the
health sector , in 2018, MOH issued Circular 46/2018/TT -BYT
regulating EMRs. According to Häyrinen et al [56], EMR was
defined as “a repository of patient data in digital form, stored
and exchanged securely , and accessible by multiple authorized
users. It contains retrospecti ve, concurrent, and prospecti ve
information, and its primary purpose is to support continuing,
efficient, and quality integrated health care.” In the circular ,
EMRs include inpatient records, outpatient records, and other
medical records prescribed by MOH, such as traditional
medicine medical records and medical records of abortion. This
is the first time Vietnam has specif ic guidance for EMR
establishment, use, and management at health care facilities
[57]. As the health care system in Vietnam is centralized under
MOH and provincial health authorities, the integration of EMRs
within the existing system, at least in the 47 central-le vel
hospitals and possibly also at 419 provincial-le vel hospitals
[58], will be easier than in countries with a more fragmented
health care system.
The plan for implementing EHRs was appro ved by MOH in
2019 in Decision 5349/QĐ-BYT [59]. According to thisdecision, EHRs are medical documents that record the health
care process of a person from birth to death in the form
prescribed by MOH. This plan guides and directs all 61 cities
and provinces of Vietnam to simultaneously deplo y and make
EHRs available for use by 80% and 95% of population in 2020
and 2025, respecti vely. If this aim is achie ved, Vietnam will be
perfectly positioned to adapt and adopt the BHS model. EHRs
may be able to assist every citizen to understand and manage
their health information continuously for life, enabling them to
prevent disease proacti vely, and actively manage their health
conditions if used as the basis for a BHS. EHRs will also support
physicians in providing health care for people in real time and
according to best practice health care recommendations.
Importantly , EHRs will provide complete, accurate, and timely
data on population health, enabling polic y makers to advance
evidence-based health polic y and health authorities to examine
the relati ve efficacy of treatments to manage health care
expenditure more efficiently .
Supporti ve social and technological environments also place
Vietnam in a good position to adopt advanced digital health
solutions of the BHS. Today , Vietnam is benef iting from a
golden population proportion with 70% of the population being
of working age (aged 18 to 65 years) [6]. This generation is
rapidly embracing new communication technologies. In 2020,
Vietnam was the seventh highest number of Facebook users in
the world [60]. On average, Vietnamese people spend about 7
hours per day on the internet [61]. The high uptak e is associated
with a high acceptability of digital technologies by Vietnamese
people. Studies have shown that people’ s attitudes toward
mobile health solutions is highly positi ve. Two-thirds of
Vietnamese youth and adolescents found mobile health apps
useful [62,63].
Online communication is back ed by a rapid and strong
development of the country’ s information and communication
technology infrastructure: penetration rate of internet access is
67%, which is among the highest in the Asia Pacific region [64],
and 95% of households are now able to use 4G netw ork [3].
Vietnam’ s technology infrastructure is also embracing
cloud-based services, which will facilitate innovative and
cost-ef fective health care delivery solutions. In recent years, a
number of projects have initiated and implemented digital health
services in large urban hospitals, including teleradiology ,
teleconsultation, telediagnosis, and videoconferencing. Examples
of these initiati ves include raising disease awareness and
encouraging people to adopt heathier behaviors [65-69],
impro ving accessibility to health care services among
disadv antaged and vulnerable target groups [70-72], and
upskilling health care workers [73-80].
A supporti ve economic environment has resulted in an increased
need for high-quality health care services and precision
medicine. Strong economic growth with an average annual gross
domestic product growth rate of 6.4% [81] is creating a booming
middle class in the society . It is estimated that this population
will increase sharply from 10% in 2015 to more than 50% in
2035 [82]. The growth in disposable income among digitally
literate, educated, and wealth y individuals creates economic
conditions for higher personal expenditure on easily accessible,
high-quality health care. Public health facilities often do not

RenderXmeet their needs due to long waiting times, inadequate
consultation time, overcro wding, and high-occupanc y bed rates
[3]. This has resulted in the rapid expansion of a private health
system, which was projected to grow from US $6.6 billion in
2016 to US $8.7 billion in 2020 [83]. Smart solutions that use
big data, cloud computing, and mobile technology are strongly
encouraged to alleviate overcro wded public hospitals and
increase quality health care overall [4].
Together , all these supporti ve polic y, social, technological, and
economic environments provide a good foundation for the health
care system in Vietnam to shift toward innovative models of
care that are being proposed in developed countries, such as the
BHS, which focus on patient-centered care.
Threats
In Vietnam, patient medical records remain paper -based at all
levels of the health care system and currently are required for
legal purposes [84]. Moreo ver, although electronic
administration management has been adopted in some large
hospitals, the quality of medical records and databases varies
across hospitals and clinics. In most health care facilities, the
medical record system is not centralized [52]. As such, one
patient can have multiple medical records. This is a barrier for
timely medical information exchange and sharing between
hospitals [69]. In addition, the development of EMRs and EHRs,
a precondition for BHS adoption, is still in the early stages
[4,44]. Although MOH has taken initial steps toward the
development of EMR and EHR systems, the readiness to
implement the EMR nationally in real clinical practice still
requires considerable preparatory effort.
First, Vietnam needs to assign a unique patient identif ier to
every citizen, which is a core requirement for successfully
introducing EHRs [52]. In 2019, MOH issued Decision
4376/QĐ-BYT , regulating the establishment, use, and
management of IDs [85]. According to the decision, an ID will
be created, comprising two series of numbers separated by a
dot. The first series is the social insurance code of the individual
while the second series is a product of an algorithm of
administrati ve information including the social insurance code,
full name, date of birth, gender , and place of birth. The social
insurance, however, is a compulsory income protection
insurance for emplo yed people only to fully or partially offset
their income that is reduced or lost due to sickness, maternity ,
labor accident, occupational disease, retirement, or death [86].
Although Vietnam has made signif icant progress in expanding
social insurance coverage in recent years, enrollment rates are
still low, especially in small- and medium-size enterprises due
to multiple barriers such as cost of contrib ution, lack of trust in
the government system, and administrati ve factors [87]. Despite
large increases in government subsidies, low enrollment rates
in compulsory social and health insurance still persist [88]. In
May 2020, only 27% of Vietnam’ s workforce had social
insurance [89,90], which is far short of the government’ s target
of 50% social insurance coverage [87] and 80% health insurance
coverage by 2020 [91,92]. The IDs, when established, therefore,
will only cover a small proportion of the population.
Second, although many health workers and patients are aware
of the advantages of using EMRs and EHRs, there are concernsabout the risks of privacy violation. The Law on Netw ork
Information Security No. 86/2015/QH13, enacted in 2015,
includes a requirement of “providing an adequate level of
protection for personal data, following the technical standards
for protection of personal data.” However, there are no clear
definitions of “an adequate level of protection” and “technical
standards” [93]. As such, there is a lack of regulatory rigor and
sanctions in managing data processors. Strengthening the legal
and regulatory system to protect patient privacy and information
security is fundamental for the success of EMR development
and application.
Finally , since Vietnam is still in the very early stage of health
care digitalization, there is no empirical evidence about the
effectiveness and sustainability of digital health initiati ves. Over
the past few years, there have been a growing number of
organizations and health startups delivering digital health
solutions to impro ve the quality of medical services. For
example, eHospital softw are, developed by the Corporation for
Financing and Promoting Technology , was first launched in
2000 [94]. This is a comprehensi ve hospital management system
providing supports to manage all activities relating to patients
in health care facilities. In 2018, eHospital with the application
of the latest 4.0 technologies such as artificial intelligence and
big data was introduced. Until now, this system has been used
in more than 400 hospitals and clinics in Vietnam. [95].
Another example is the Hospital Information System of the
Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group, which was
introduced in 2015. This solution with its three levels of
management—state, hospital and patient—aims at supporting
provincial health authorities and hospital managers to make
well-informed decisions for health care impro vement and
assisting patients to facilitate and adhere to their health care
appointments online. This allegedly leads to increasing
transparenc y and reducing overcro wding in health care facilities
[96]. Nevertheless, these initiati ves have not been rigorously
evaluated. Lack of evaluation results will prevent the
government from evidence-based polic ymaking and hinder the
broader implementation of existing projects or development of
new initiati ves.
Discussion
Necessary Conditions for Successful Adoption of the
BHS Model in Vietnam
Vietnam has identif iable opportunities to adopt the BHS model
and implement digitalization in health care. To grasp these
opportunities, the following strate gies are recommended.
First, establishing a national ID for each individual based on
their social insurance code is one core requirement for
successfully introducing EHRs. In a recent Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development polic y report,
recommendations have been proposed for the Vietnamese
government to increase the enrollment rates of social insurance.
They include reducing obstacles to participation (eg, simplifying
administration processes for paying insurance), introducing
incenti ve scheme for emplo yees to participate (eg, providing
government subsidies for participation of low-income people
J Med Internet Res 2021 | vol. 23 | iss. 6 | e24601 | p. 7 https://www .jmir.org/2021/6/e24601

XSL•FO
RenderXin the voluntary system), and adopting a systematic approach
to social protection (eg, considering the interaction between
various social protection mechanisms) [87].
Second, successful adoption of the BHS requires a whole-system
approach involving the support of different sectors in the society .
Obviously , MOH would have to play a key role in this adoption
process but would need to collaborate with related ministries—in
particular , the Ministry of Science and Technology and the
Ministry of Information and Communications—in developing
and implementing a digital health strate gy. The resources needed
to impro ve the health care system are sizeable. MOH would
need to garner funding from different sources, both domestic
and foreign agencies: government, social entrepreneurs, or
private businesses [69,70].
Third, integrating personal data in EHR and EMR systems will
increase the risk of privacy violation and cybersecurity breaches.
The Vietnamese government needs to impro ve the security of
information technology platforms in general and health care in
particular to protect patient privacy and information security
[70].
Fourth, to impro ve the adoption of evidence-based practices, it
will be necessary to provide resources to demonstrate the
effectiveness and impact of digital health initiati ves and establish
a netw ork of collaborators including health care administrators,
clinicians, community representati ves, digital health researchers,
information technology developers, and public health education
experts [69]. This will be a great opportunity for further
enhancing strong collaborations between multisectors and
multistak eholders at various levels, which are essential for
successfully reforming the health care system in Vietnam. BHS
implementation would require the involvement of local
educators to provide education for communities, raising
awareness of the benef its the system could bring to individualsand society , coaching to enhance self-management behaviors,
and increasing engagement with the system [97]. Strong
evidence about the effectiveness of digital health initiati ves in
Vietnam will encourage the government to develop appropriate
health policies and increase opportunities for ongoing projects
to scale-up by attracting funding and support [70]. Thus, there
is a substantial need for further research in this area in the future.
Finally , to increase the acceptability and feasibility of digital
health initiati ves, a co-design approach is crucial. Co-design is
defined as the “collecti ve creati vity as it is applied across the
whole span of a design process” [98]. In the design process,
diverse experts such as researchers, designers or developers and
potential customers and users work closely together to
understand the needs and preferences of end users [99,100]. A
co-design approach is likely to increase scalability and
dissemination of the initiati ve [99].
Conclusions
The overarching goal of the BHS is, with the support of digital
technologies, to deliver best practice health care and reduce
pressure on the current health care system by empo wering
people to direct their own health care, regardless of their
geographical location and economic status [44]. The BHS offers
a promising and intelligent health care that which may be
efficient and suitable for Vietnam in the new era of the Fourth
Industrial Revolution [101]. Vietnam has tremendous
opportunities and a favorable polic y, social, technological, and
economic environment to adopt this model of comprehensi ve
patient-centric health care. In order to uptak e, adapt, and
implement the BHS successfully , Vietnam needs to apply a
whole-system approach in transformation and operation
processes.
