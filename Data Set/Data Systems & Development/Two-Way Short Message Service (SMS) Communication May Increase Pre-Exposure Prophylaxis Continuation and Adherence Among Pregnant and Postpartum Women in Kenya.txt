We evaluated a 2-way short messaging service (SMS) communication platform to improve continuation of pre-
exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention among Kenyan pregnant and postpartum women who initiatedPrEP within routine maternal child health and family planning clinics. SMS increased support for PrEP, provid-
ed opportunities for dialogue beyond the clinic, and enabled women to ask and receive answers in real-time,
which facilitated continued PrEP use.
ABSTRACT
Introduction: We evaluated a 2-way short message service (SMS) communication p latform to improve continuation of pre-exposure prophylaxis
(PrEP) for HIV prevention among Kenyan women who initiated PrEP with in routine maternal child health (MCH) and family planning clinics.
Methods: We adapted an existing SMS platform (Mobile WACh [mWACh]) to send PrEP-tailored, theory-based SMS and allow clients
to communicate with a remote nurse. Women who did not have HIV and who were initiating PrEP at 2 MCH/family planning clinics inKisumu County, Kenya, from February to October 2018, were offered enrollment into the mWACh-PrEP program; SMS communicationwas free. We evaluated acceptability, satisfaction, and implementation metrics. In a pre/postevaluation, we compared PrEP continuationat 1-month postinitiation among women who initiated PrEP in the period before (n=166) versus after mWACh-PrEP implementation,
adjusting for baseline differences.
Results: Of the 334 women who were screened for enrollment into the mWACh-PrEP program; 193 (58%) were eligible and of those,
190 (98%) accepted enrollment. Reasons for ineligibility (n=141) included no phone access (29%) and shared SIM cards (25%). Median
age was 25 years (interquartile range=22 –30), and 91% were MCH clients. Compared to women who initiated PrEP in the month be-
fore mWACh-PrEP implementation, women who enrolled in mWACh-PrEP were more likely to return for their first PrEP follow-up visit(40% vs. 53%; adjusted risk ratio [aRR]=1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI]= 1.06, 1.50; P=.008) and more likely to continue PrEP (22%
vs. 43%; aRR=1.75; 95% CI=1.21, 2.55; P=.003). Among those who returned, 99% reported successful receipt of SMS through the
mWACh-PrEP system and 94% reported that mWACh-PrEP helped them understand PrEP better. Concerns about PrEP use, how it works,
and side effects accounted for the majority (80%) of issues raised by participants using SMS.
Conclusions: Two-way SMS expanded support for PrEP and opportunities for dialogue beyond the clinic and enabled women to ask and
receive answers in real time regarding PrEP, which facilitated its continued use.
INTRODUCTION
Young women in sub-Saharan Africa have one of the
highest HIV incidence rates globally.1This high HIV
incidence persists during pregnancy and breastfeeding,2
and there is evidence that HIV acquisition risk increasesby more than 2-fold during pregnancy and the postpar-tum period.
3Pregnant women who become acutely
infected with HIV account for an estimated 26% of all
vertical HIV transmissions.4,5To prevent HIV acquisition

Data from Kenya estimated that HIV incidence
among pregnant and postpartum women is
2.31/100 person-years.7Programmatic PrEP de-
livery to pregnant and postpartum women in ma-
ternal child health (MCH) clinics is ongoing inKenya,
8,9and other countries are planning PrEP
implementation within MCH settings.
Although a majority of pregnant and post-
partum women with HIV risk factors acceptedPrEP when offered within routine MCH settings
in Kenya,
9more than 50% discontinued PrEP with-
in 30 days of initiation. M obile health (mHealth)
tools can be used to educate clients, provide remin-
ders for visits and medications, improve communi-
cation between health c are workers and clients,
and improve self-efficacy, all potentially leading
to better medication adherence outcomes.10–13
Studies are ongoing to enhance PrEP continuation
and adherence using mHealth approaches in diverse
populations including men who have sex with men,transgender women, and adolescent girls who are
not pregnant.
14–17To date, no PrEP a dherence inter-
vention studies have targeted pregnant or postpar-tum women who have unique considerations for
PrEP use. Qualitative studies have found that preg-
nant women who use PrEP are highly motivated to
protect their infants from HIV, though some have
concerns about whether PrEP affects their infant,
18
and postpartum women have challenges remember-
i n gt ot a k eP r E Pp i l l sd u r i n gt h ec o m p l e xt r a n s i t i o nt o
motherhood.18Therefore, mHealth strategies tailored
to pregnant and postpartum women who use PrEP
are needed.
To support PrEP continuation and adherence
among pregnant and postpartum women, we
adapted the mobile communication platform,Mobile WACh [mWACh] —named for the
University of Washington ’sG l o b a lC e n t e rf o r
Integrated Health of Women, Adolescents, andChildren —
19–21using 2-way short message ser-
vice (SMS) between participants and remote
nurses. We conducted a mixed-methods evalua-tion within a programmatic PrEP delivery settingto assess implementation metrics and evaluatePrEP continuation and adherence outcomesamong women PrEP initiators enrolled in theSMS program.
METHODS
Program and Setting
The PrEP Implementation for Young Women
and Adolescents (PrIYA) Program was a 2-yearimplementation project in Kusumu County,
Kenya, a region where adult HIV prevalence is19.9% (up to 28% among pregnant women).
22–24
The program was designed to reach adolescents
and young women at high risk for HIV acquisitionthrough integrated delivery of PrEP within routine
MCH and family planning systems.
9Conducted in
collaboration with the Kisumu County Depart-ment of Health and Sanitation and the NationalAIDS and STI Control Programme, PrIYA was firstimplemented in 16 facilities (11 public, 4 faith-based, and 1 private) followed by a PrEP mentor-ship program in 20 additional sites. The 16 highestvolume (based on monthly number of new antena-tal care ANC clients) facilities in Kisumu Countywere selected to be in the PrIYA Program. The cur-rent evaluation focuses on the implementation of a2-way SMS intervention among a subset of partici-pants in the PrIYA Program. The SMS interventionwas conducted at 2 public-sector sites purposivelyselected based on the highest monthly enrollmentof new PrEP clients.
In the PrIYA Program, 40 program-supported
nurses were trained on PrEP delivery per nationalguidelines as previously described.
25Briefly, nurses
screened women who did not have HIV for behav-ioral risk factors, including male partner HIV statusand willingness to consider PrEP. Behavioral riskfactors were assessed using a standardized risk as-sessment tool.
8Women who wanted to initiate
PrEP and were medically eligible received same-
day PrEP and were scheduled for a 1-monthfollow-up visit.

mWACh-PrEP Program Evaluation Design
This mixed-methods evaluation of the SMScommunication program for supporting PrEP ad-herence and continuation had 3 primary aims:(1) describe implementation metrics (e.g., eligibil-ity, acceptability, satisfaction, and utilization);(2) compare frequency of PrEP continuation andself-reported adherence before and after the intro-duction of the SMS program; and (3) identifyissues and concerns among new PrEP initiators
by qualitatively analyzing transcripts of SMS
conversations.
mWACh-PrEP Program Development
Our team previously developed mWACh, a user-friendly bidirectional interactive SMS platform,that enables efficient communication betweenwomen attending MCH clinics and nurses.
19The
mWACh platform sends timed preprogrammedSMS messages that clients can respond to andUsing SMS Communication May Increase Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Continuation and Adherence www.ghspjournal.org
Global Health: Science and Practice 2020 | Volume 8 | Number 1 56allows clients to send messages with questions or
concerns. A trained nurse-counselor receives andresponds to messages from women, providing amechanism for women to interact with nurses inreal-time and an opportunity for medication ad-herence support.
9mWACh has been shown to be
feasible, acceptable, and effective in improving
MCH outcomes.20,21
We adapted the mWACh platform to send
weekly PrEP-tailored, theory-based SMS and to
allow MCH and family planning clients who initi-
ate PrEP to communicate with a nurse about theirindividual needs. SMS messages incorporated be-
havioral theory-informed counseling framed in
the informational-motivational-behavioral skills
model, specifically tailored to women receiving
PrEP in the context of MCH/family planning
services ( Box). The intervention was field-tested
by PrIYA nurses with more than 6 months ofexperience delivering PrEP to MCH and family
planning clients before implementation. During
field-testing, we elicited feedback from PrEP pro-
viders on the utility, frequency, and content of
SMS messages to refine the tool. The final messagebank was translated and back translated from
English to Kiswahili and Dhuluo (a prevalent local
language in western Kenya). PrIYA nurses were
trained on using the mWACH-PrEP system and
responding to SMS messages from clients based
on behavioral counseling principles includinginformational-motivational-behavioral skills, mo-
tivational interviewing, and positive reinforce-
ment. We also developed and tested quality
assurance/quality control systems that reviewed
BOX. Example SMS From Automated Message Bank and Behavioral
Theory Adapted for PrEP
Motivational Interviewing (e.g., goal-oriented action plans)
{name}, this is {nurse} from {clinic}. It can be difficult to take medications every
day especially if you are trying to be discrete. Many people ask a friend to help
remind them, set a timer on their phone, or take it with a meal. You can also put
it in a different container you can carry with you in private. How do you remem-
ber to take your medication? Do you have any challenges taking it every day?
Theory of Planned Behavior (e.g., perceived behavioral control)
{name}, this is {nurse} from {clinic}. Side effects from PrEP affect each person dif-
ferently. Most side effects lessen after the first few weeks of use, once the body is
used to the medication. Please let us know if you are having any side effects. We
can help you manage them or know if it is okay to continue.
Health Belief Model (e.g., perceived barriers)
{name}, this is {nurse} from {clinic}. You are doing a great job taking care ofyourself. PrEP is very effective at preventing you from getting HIV if you take it
every day. It also helps prevent HIV infection to your baby if you are pregnant. If
you miss too many doses it may not work. Are you having any challenges taking
the medication?
Social-Cognitive Theory (e.g., positive reinforcement)
Good job coming in for your visit! You will receive weekly SMS to help support
taking your medication. Please SMS back and tell us any questions or concerns
you have. Please tell us if you need assistance with your prevention medication.
If you have any challenges or stop PrEP, please let us know.

Global Health: Science and Practice 2020 | Volume 8 | Number 1 57and discussed responses to SMS with medical and
research teams in Kenya and Seattle to ensureconsistency and accuracy of nurses ’responses to
women.
Program Procedures
From February to October 2018, we approached
women on the same day they initiated PrEP atthe 2 selected MCH/family planning clinics andoffered them participation in the mWACH-PrEPprogram. Women were eligible if they initiatedPrEP that day, had a functioning cellphone in-hand that they did not share with anyone, and
had an active SIM card on the Safaricom network
(Kenya ’s largest network provider). Reasons for
ineligibility were captured. We did not excludewomen who expressed confidentiality concernsrelated to their PrEP use or content of the SMS.All women were free to decline enrollment andwelcome to stop receiving SMS at anytime.
Women registered into the mWACh-PrEP
platform indicated their preferences for messagedelivery including a preferred name for messag-
ing, language (English, Kiswahili, or Dholuo),
and day of the week and time for SMS delivery.All automated push messages included participantnickname, clinic, and nurse name, an educationalmessage or actionable advice targeting PrEP ad-herence and continuation and/or MCH/familyplanning topics, and a question related to the con-
tent. SMS topics included adherence encourage-
ment, PrEP efficacy and safety, self-efficacy forprevention of HIV, support for potential PrEP sideeffects, behavioral skills (tips for rememberingPrEP medications), and visit reminders. Duringenrollment, the program nurse explained thatreplies to the automated SMS questions were vol-
untary, though women were enrouraged to reply.
Women were also encouraged to send SMS withtheir concerns or questions whenever they arose.The program nurse was available to answer SMSduring normal business hours on weekdays. Allmessaging was free of charge to the participant us-ing a reverse billed short code. SMS were sent
from enrollment until December 2018. Partici-
pants could voluntarily and autonomously exitthe program by texting “STOP, ”which would end
all platform communication.
Data Management and Analysis
All SMS communication was conducted throughour custom web application designed for 3-waycommunication between the automated pushsystem, program staff, and participants. SMS datawere downloaded biweekly by program data man-
agers to track SMS outages and data on implemen-tation activity (e.g., new enrollments, sucessfulautomated SMS delivery, participant responses,voluntary exits). When a participant sent anunprompted question or sent a reply to an auto-mated message that was not in English, programnurses translated the SMS into English within thesystem daily to ensure interpretation consistencyand allow for quality assurance/quality control.We defined utilization using 2 metrics: responding
to automated push messages and sending an
unprompted question or concern using SMS.
Program nurses administered questionnaires
to women enrolled in mWACh-PrEP at routine1-month PrEP follow-up visits to assess satisfac-tion using a series of items on a 5-point Likert scale(e.g., I would recommend the SMS program toother women who use PrEP; strongly agree, agree,neutral, disagree, strongly disagree). Closed-endeditems assessed self-reported utilization experienceswith the platform (e.g., I took action based on thenurse ’s advice; yes/no). We also abstracted PrEP
indicators from the Kenya Ministry of Health client
encounter form that included data on attendance
of a PrEP follow-up visit, self-reported adherence(number of missed PrEP doses in the past month),and PrEP refills. We defined PrEP continuationas confirmed dispensation of a PrEP refill at anattended follow-up visit. PrEP discontinuation wasdefined as no PrEP refill or no attendance at afollow-up visit. Data from PrEP follow-up visitswere abstracted for all women who initiated PrEPin the month before implementation of themWACh-PrEP program and from all women whowere screened for mWACh-PrEP enrollment.
We used descriptive statistics to summarize
acceptability, satisfaction, and utilization indica-
tors. We used Chi-squared tests for proportionsand Kruskall-Wallis tests for continous measuresto compare baseline demographic and behavioralcharacteristics of women who were eligible andenrolled in the mWACh-PrEP program with(1) women who initiated PrEP in the monthbefore implementation of mWACh-PrEP and(2) women who were screened for enrollmentbut were ineligible/declined. We compared PrEPcontinuation and self-reported adherence amongwomen who enrolled in mWACh-PrEP withwomen in the other 2 groups using Chi-squaredtests and multivariate Poisson regression modelswith robust error variance, an approach used
when the outcome prevalence is not rare (e.g.,
>10%).
26,27Final multivariate Poisson models
were adjusted for age and marital status becauseUsing SMS Communication May Increase Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Continuation and Adherence www.ghspjournal.org
Global Health: Science and Practice 2020 | Volume 8 | Number 1 58these characteristics were significantly different
between women who enrolled in the mWACh-
PrEP program and those who initiated PrEP before
mWACh-PrEP implementation. All statisticalanalyses were performed by using StataSE15.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Statisticalcomparisons were 2-sided and were considered sig-nificant at the P<.05 level.
Qualitative Analysis
At the completion of the mWACh-PrEP program,
transcripts of SMS conversations were analyzed
using a modified constant comparative approach.Our primary goal was to identify issues raised bywomen who initiated PrEP through unpromptedquestions or concerns sent to nurses using themWACh-PrEP system. We developed an initialcodebook based on a review of a subset of tran-
scripts and input from nurses who responded to
participants ’messages, and the codebook was iter-
atively refined. SMS transcripts were transferredinto Microsoft Excel for data management. Alltranscripts were coded by 2 research team mem-bers (ZR and JP), and coding disagreements wereresolved through discussion. Key issues raised bywomen who enrolled in mWACh-PrEP were iden-
tified by reading transcripts to identify similaritiesand differences across conversations, and codes
were subsequently organized within thematic
categories to identify trends. We also selected rep-resentative quotations pertaining to each maincategory.
Human Subjects Considerations
Protocols were reviewed and approved by theKenyatta National Hospital-University of Nairobi
Ethics Research Committee and University of
Washington Human Subjects Review Committee.In addition, approval was obtained from theKisumu County Department of Health and admin-
istrators in respective health facilities. Women pro-
vided informed consent for all activities.
RESULTS
Overall, 334 women were screened for participa-tion in the mWACH-PrEP program ( Figure 1 );
193 (58%) were eligible and 190 (98%) of eligible
women enrolled. Reasons for ineligibility (n=141)
included not having a phone (28%) or SafaricomSIM card (15%) in the clinic that day, sharing
SIM cards (24%), using a network other than
Safaricom (15%), having a broken phone (12%)or other phone issues (3%). Among the 3 (2%)
women who declined, 2 feared intimate partner

an gestational age was 25 weeks (interquartilerange [IQR]=20 –28).
Women who were eligible and enrolled were
slightly older than women who were ineligible ordeclined enrollment (median age 25 years oldsand 23 years, respectively; P<.001). Compared to
women who initiated PrEP in the period beforemWACh-PrEP, eligible and enrolled women werealso slightly older (median age 24 years old and
25 years, respectively; P=.006), more frequently
married (81% and 90%, respectively; P=.02), and
more frequently attending first ANC visits, if preg-nant (33% and 52%, respectively; P=.03). There
were no other differences in demographic and be-havioral characteristics between women whowere eligible and enrolled and women who wereeither ineligible/declined or who initiated PrEPbefore mWACh-PrEP ( Table 1 ).
Acceptability and Satisfaction
Overall, 100 of 190 (53%) women who enrolled
returned for a follow-up visit at a median of29 days (IQR=28 –40) since PrEP initiation.
Almost all (99%) reported successful receipt of
SMS messages through the mWACh-PrEP system.Among the 99 women who received messages,72 (73%) women reported consulting by SMSwith the nurse and, of those, 47 (66%) reportedcontinuing PrEP because of the nurse ’s advice
(Supplemental Tables ). Most women (94%) reported
that the SMS helped them understand PrEP betterand 89% reported that the SMS helped them adhereto PrEP. Almost all (95%) would recommendmWACh-PrEP to other women who use PrEP, and95% would also use the program again, if offered(Supplemental Tables ).
PrEP Continuation and Adherence
Among the 166 women who initiated PrEP in
the month before mWACh-PrEP implementation,67 (40%) attended a PrEP follow-up visit com-pared to 101 (53%) of women who enrolled inmWACh-PrEP (adjusted risk ratio [aRR]=1.26;95% confidence interval [CI]=1.06, 1.50; P=.008).
Compared to women who initiated PrEP in themonth before mWACh-PrEP implementation,women who enrolled in mWACh-PrEP were al-most twice as likely to continue PrEP after adjust-ment for age and marital status (22% vs. 43%;aRR=1.75; 95% CI=1.21, 2.55; P=.003). Among
women who returned for follow-up, 74 (73%)of women who enrolled in mWACh-PrEP self-reported high PrEP adherence ( <1m i s s e dp i l l /week) compared to 37 (55%) of women who
initiated PrEP before mWACh-PrEP (aRR=1.35;
95% CI=1.28, 1.41; P<.001). Compared to women
in a contemporaneous cohort who were ineligibleor declined enrollment, women enrolled inmWACh-PrEP were also more likely to return fora follow-up visit (38% vs. 52%, respectively;P=.02) and continue PrEP (28% vs. 43%; P=.005);
among those who attended follow-up visits, self-
reported high adherence was similar across those
contemporaneous groups (67% vs. 73%, respec-tively P=.42).
Participant Utilization of mWACH-PrEP
Full transcripts from SMS conversations were
available and analyzed for 170 of the 190 (89%)
women who enrolled in the mWACh-PrEP
program. Among 170 women with analyzed tran-scripts, 97 (57%) ever responded to the automat-ed messages. Median duration of enrollment inthe mHealth program was 24 weeks (IQR=17–31). Frequency of responding to automated
messages was highest at week 1 (29%) and sub-
stantially lower by week 6 (14%) ( Figure 2a ). The
median time to response cessation was 6 weeks(IQR=1 –13) among women who ever responded.
Overall, 74 of the 170 (44%) participants
ever sent unprompted questions or concerns tothe nurse using SMS during follow-up, and a totalof 183 unprompted SMS were received andanswered by nurses. The median number ofunprompted questions/concerns sent per client
was 2 (IQR=1 –3). Seven major topics were raised
by participants in their SMS queries ( Figure 2b ).
PrEP continuation and discontinuation was themost frequently raised topic overall (27%). Thesemessages included queries about how long onemust continue PrEP use, if stopping and restartingPrEP is possible, and self-reporting PrEP discontin-
uation among participants who did not return for
follow-up visits ( Table 2 ). Side effects (24%) were
the next most frequent topic of unprompted ques-tions/concerns. These messages included requestsfor advice on dealing with side effects, confirma-tion of whether symptoms experienced (e.g., nau-sea, vomiting, weakness) were normal with PrEPuse, and clarification of whether and when symp-
toms would eventually subside. Participants also
raised issues about the logistics of PrEP use(16%), including where/how to get refills andwhat to do if doses were missed. Participants alsosought clarifications about PrEP (13%) includinghow PrEP works, how it is different from drugsused to treat HIV, and whether men could alsoMost women

PrEP dis/continuation Thanks, nurse, for the concern. Just want to know the
duration of taking PrEP? Because in my case, we are adiscordant couple.Hello {Name}. It is important that you continue taking
PrEP until your partner's viral load is suppressed. You canincorporate condoms during sexual intercourse to protect
you further. We encourage that you freely share health
information related to your partners care. (14 hours;
participant sent SMS in the evening, nurse responded the
next morning)
Hi, I separated with my husband because of mistrust.
He felt ill and was taken to the hospital, where he tested
HIV-negative and malaria-positive. Should I continueusing this drug? I am not a sex worker.Hello {Name}. You can continue taking your medication.
But should you desire to discontinue, please come back to
our clinic for further advice. I would also like to tell youthat PrEP is not ONLY used by sex workers, but also those
who feel they are at risk of becoming infected. (3 hours)
Hi {Nurse ’s name}. If I'm abstaining from sex and I also
stay alone, should I continue to use this drug?Hello {Name}. If you feel you are no longer at risk of
being infected, you may stop PrEP. However, you should
continue taking the drug 1 pill daily for 28 days from the
last risk period. (1 hour)
Side effects After taking it (PrEP), and I vomit once a day. Nausea and vomiting is common in pregnancy and could
also be a side effect of PrEP. Minor side effects like
nausea and vomiting are manageable. Avoiding fattyfood, eating smaller meals, and limiting spicy foods may
help. PrEP minor side effects subside after a short period
of time. (20 minutes)
PrEP clarification Hey, is it true that PrEP is a type of ARV? They say it is
given to HIV þand HIV- individuals.Hello {Name}. PrEP is classified as one of the
antiretroviral medications used to protect someone from
HIV/AIDS. PrEP medication is given to different peopledepending on the substantial risks involved. Discordant
couples, unknown HIV status of your sexual partner, and
individuals with multiple sexual partners are some of the
people at risk who could be eligible to use PrEP. (2 hours)
Does PrEP prevent someone from conceiving? Morning {Name}. PrEP does not prevent someone from
conceiving. It is safe for pregnancy as well. It can have
side effects like headache, nausea, and vomiting that
subsidize with time. (1 hour)
I abide by what you people told me at the clinic, but
some information I was told elsewhere is different. I
heard it is not good to use this medication (PrEP) until I
know my partner ’s status. Another issue is that PrEP is
an antiretroviral medication. Can I get HIV/AIDS if I
use PrEP medication for long periods?Hello, {Name}. PrEP medication helps to prevent HIV/
AIDS acquisition. Not knowing your partners status is one
of the risks that may lead to an individual acquiring HIV/
AIDS. It is important to know your partner ’ss t a t u sb e c a u s e
it helps to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition. In case you
want to stop PrEP, it is advisable to come back to the clinic
for discontinuation. (2 hours)
PrEP logistics Hello, Nurse. I would like to ask if it is good to take my
medications before taking my meals?Hello, {Name}. It is good to take the medications after
meals to avoid side effects such as nausea and vomiting.
(10 minutes)
Is it a must that I should take it (PrEP) at bedtime? Hello, it is not a must to take at bedtime. PrEP can be
taken one tablet daily either in the morning, afternoon or
evening. It is also advisable to be strict on the time you
take the medication. In case you decide its morning
hours, then every day you should take it in the morning.(19 hours; participant sent SMS in the evening, nurse

questions and concerns sent by participants andanswered by nurses were not PrEP-related. These
messages included concerns regarding HIV risk
(3%), queries regarding MCH or family planningissues in general (4%), and other topics like aller-gic reactions to other medications or relationshipconcerns (13%).
DISCUSSION
In this mixed-methods evaluation of an mHealthtool within a programmatic PrEP delivery setting,we found very high acceptance (98%) among thesubset of women who met inclusion criteria, an al-most 2-fold greater early PrEP continuation, and
higher self-reported adherence among women
who were enrolled in mWACh-PrEP than thosewho initiated PrEP before mWACh-PrEP imple-
mentation. We also found high satisfaction with
the mWACh-PrEP system and high utilization.
Almost half (44%) of the women who enrolled
had unprompted questions or concerns addressedusing SMS, most of which were PrEP-related. To our
knowledge, this is the first evaluation of an mHealth
intervention for PrEP adherence targeting pregnant
and postpartum women, and this communication
platform addressed topics ve ry specific to pregnancy
and the postpartum period. As PrEP delivery within
routine MCH/family planning settings expands,mHealth strategies tailored to pregnant and postpar-
tum women may improve PrEP continuation and
adherence in this unique population.

before initiation in the PrIYA program lastedTABLE 2. Continued

Participants by SMSNurse ’s Response to Participant (Time to Response From
SMS Receipt)
In case I forget to take PrEP medication today and then
I remember the next day, can I take the medicine then?Hello, at that point in time when you remember to take
medication, you should swallow 1 tablet. It is not
advisable to swallow 2 tablets at once because you forgot
taking the medication the previous day. You can set an
alarm on your phone to act as a reminder when to take
the medication. (20 hours; participant sent SMS in the
evening, nurse responded the next morning)
HIV risk I am inquiring if I have 2 partners, 1 has HIV and the
other one is HIV-negative. If it happens that I have sex
with the negative partner, can he get HIV because the
other one is positive?How are you, {Name}. You can ’t transmit HIV to him
because you are negative and you are on PrEP taking
them faithfully. Again, if your positive partner is taking
antiretrovirals as prescribed, he can ’t transmit HIV to
you .....However, you should also use condoms when
you are meeting your negative partner because you don ’t
know if he is having multiple partners. (4 hours)
MCH/family planning Hello, I have been using Depo Provera for a long time
until I stopped because of excess bleeding ...I haven't
experienced any of these side effects since I stopped
using the injection. My monthly periods have resumed
normally, 5 days, with 3 heavy days and lighter 2
days. Which method of family planning can I use
without side effects?Hello, I would kindly advise you to find time and come to
the hospital so that we can talk more on the othermethods of family planning, so that you can be able to
decide and choose one of the family planning methods
that you would want to use. (2 hours)
Now is when the baby is breastfeeding too much be-
cause she had mouth rash, she was not feeding.Hello {Name}. Breastfeeding is important for the baby
because it helps in growth and development. Did you
bring the child for review at the clinic regarding the oralthrush? When the baby has lesions in the mouth it can
affect how the baby breastfeeds and feeding orally. (16
hours; participant sent SMS in the evening, nurse
responded the next morning)
Other (not related to
PrEP)I have a problem when having sex with my husband
with a condom. I experience bloating and abdominalpain. What can I do please? Should I stop having sex?Hi {Name}. You can stop having sex, but I would like you
to see a doctor for further management and instructions.(23 hours; participant sent SMS on the weekend, nurse

Global Health: Science and Practice 2020 | Volume 8 | Number 1 64approximately 18 minutes per client.25Women
who initiated PrEP received this standardizedcounseling from nurses who were experiencedwith PrEP delivery, yet clarifications and concernsabout the PrEP use and how PrEP worksaccounted for more than half (56%) of allunprompted issues raised by the participants. Thisindicated that many women who initiated PrEPleft the clinic with concerns about PrEP use orthat PrEP concerns may have arisen after they leftthe clinic that would otherwise go unaddressed
without access to a remote nurse. Additionally,
nearly one-quarter (24%) of issues raised by parti-cipants pertained to side effects. Pregnancy mayamplify side effects associated with early PrEP use(e.g., nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal altera-tions), and experiencing side effects is a leadingcause of PrEP discontinuation in this population.
28
mHealth applications have successfully facilitatedmonitoring and mitigation of medication sideeffects for other health conditions in low- andmiddle-income countries.
29,30Promoting self-
management of PrEP side effects and empoweringwomen by filling PrEP knowledge gaps could be amechanism by which the mWACh-PrEP platform
improved PrEP continuation in this study. We
found diminished response to automated mes-sages after 1 month, which suggests that a time-limited mHealth intervention may be sufficient toaddress concerns and support onboarding to sus-tained PrEP use.
Ongoing studies are testing mHealth tools that
address various stages of the PrEP care continuumin diverse populations, including using mHealth toincrease uptake
31,32and enhance adherence.14–17
We focused on early PrEP continuation and ad-
herence among women who initiate PrEP withinMCH/family planning because we previouslyfound a steep drop-off in PrEP continuation and
suboptimal PrEP adherence in this population.
The mWACh platform was initially designed toaddress maternal and infant health concernsamong pregnant and postpartum women.
19The
adapted mWACh-PrEP system focused on PrEPuse. Thus, our evaluation assessed short-termPrEP-specific outcomes and did not measure otherMCH-related outcomes. Additionally, in this eval-uation we did not assess provider time or othercosts associated with implementation. Futurestudies should incorporate information beyondearly PrEP outcomes, including impact on mater-nal/infant health and provider time and costs,to determine whether mWACh-PrEP is a cost-
effective strategy within routine MCH/family
planning systems delivering PrEP.Although we found high acceptability in our
evaluation, 42% of screened women were ineligi-
ble due to cell phone-related issues. The most fre-
quent reason for ineligibility was not having a cellphone in the clinic; this was required to confirmregistration was successful. Future iterations ofthe mWACh-PrEP platform could incorporateoff-site registration options for clients to completeself-registration at a later time. Additionally, not
having a SIM card compatible with the mWACh
system was another major reason for ineligibility.We partnered with Safaricom for mWACh-PrEP asthis is the largest network provider in Kenya.Inclusion of other network providers within theplatform, which is feasible at a modest additionalcost, would increase accessibility and reach.
Limitations
Our evaluation has limitations. We did not collectinformation on mWACh-PrEP eligibility criteria(e.g., phone availability) during the period before
mWACh-PrEP implementation. Therefore, our
pre/postevaluation design produced less rigorousresults than a randomized trial, and we may haveunmeasured differences between our comparisongroups that could influence effect size. However,this nonrandomized evaluation provides insightinto how mHealth interventions work in a real-
world context. Within a program setting, we found
nearly a 2-fold increase in PrEP continuationamong women who enrolled in the mWACh-PrEPcompared to both women who initiated PrEPbefore mWACh-PrEP implementation and a con-current cohort of women who were ineligible/declined.
We intentionally restricted our comparison
group to only January 2018, the month immedi-
ately preceding mWACh-PrEP implementation.
Several events during the period before January2018 were beyond control of the program andlimited the program ’s ability to consistently pro-
vide PrEP in a representative population. A na-tional nurses strike in Kenya from June throughNovember 2017 halted service delivery in public-sector facilities,
33and the response in Kisumu to
the presidential election of August 2017 also im-
pacted the health sector.34January 2018 was the
most comparable month in terms of PrEP provi-sion and stability of service delivery within healthfacilities in Kisumu.
We did not offer incentives or reimbursement
for enrollment into mWACh-PrEP and did notconduct any procedures beyond routine clinicalcare and satisfaction surveys, including intensiveUsing SMS Communication May Increase Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Continuation and Adherence www.ghspjournal.org
Global Health: Science and Practice 2020 | Volume 8 | Number 1 65follow-up procedures or contact tracing. Additi-
onally, we offered mWACh-PrEP enrollment toall PrEP initiators, regardless of partner HIV statusor other behavioral HIV risk factors. Therefore,
our results may be more representative of what
could be expected if mWACh-PrEP were to be pro-grammatically rolled out than a randomized trialor an approach targeted to only women who self-disclose high behavioral HIV risk.
We relied on routinely collected data to mea-
sure PrEP continuation and self-reported adher-ence without an objective biomarker for PrEPexposure, which could have introduced reportingbias or misclassification. Studies comparing self-reported PrEP adherence to objective drug levelsamong men who have sex with men, transgenderwomen, and individuals in HIV-serodiscordantcouples in real-world settings have found reason-ably high concordance.
35–37Future evaluations
among pregnant and postpartum women inAfrican settings could incorporate biomarkers ofPrEP exposure to confirm self-reported adher-
ence. We only included women who newly
initiated PrEP. Future evaluations could assesswhether the mWACh-PrEP program improves ad-herence among women with a poor adherencehistory. Additionally, our satisfaction data are lim-ited to women who returned for a follow-up visitand may not be representative of all women en-rolled in the mWACh-PrEP program.
CONCLUSION
In summary, we found very high acceptance ofthe mWACh-PrEP program among pregnant andpostpartum women and improved early PrEP con-tinuation and adherence among those enrolledcompared to women who initiated PrEP beforethe mWACH-PrEP program. mWACh-PrEP ex-tended the reach of the clinic and enabled clientsto promptly address concerns about PrEP which,in turn, appeared to help them continue and/oradhere to PrEP. Women found a short period ofSMS support helpful. It is plausible that this sys-
tem could be readily scalable and cost-effective,
potentially improving outcomes and offsettingcosts from unused or misused medicines.
