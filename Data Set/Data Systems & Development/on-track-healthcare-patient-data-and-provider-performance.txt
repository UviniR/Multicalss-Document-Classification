key results :
Biometric tracking increased patient adherence to TB treatment and the World Health Organization’s DOTS protocol.
Patients that received treatment in a center with biometric monitoring were 1.8 percentage points (25 percent) less likely to 
interrupt treatment and were 13.9 percentage points (26 percent) more likely to consume medication in person.
Greater health worker effort was a major factor in increased adherence to TB treatment.  Tracking of health worker 
performance increased the time providers spent at health centers by about 19 percent and frequency of home visits to patients by 
32 percent. There was no evidence that health workers strategically avoided patients with a perceived higher risk of defaulting or 
reduced patient detection efforts.
Biometric devices improved the accuracy of NGO health records and official government health registers. The devices 
reduced overreporting of new cases by 20 percent and underreporting of treatment interruptions by 25 percent.Featuring an evaluation by Thomas Bossuroy, Clara Delavallade, and Vincent Ponsbriefcase

Biometric tracking increased the likelihood that patients adhered to recommended tuberculosis treatment, improved health 
worker attendance, and reduced misreporting of patient data by health workers. 
Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading infectious disease killer in the world, 
claiming nearly 1.5 million lives annually.1 Detecting infection early and 
ensuring patients complete the rigid six-month course of treatment 
are key to stopping its spread and to promoting patient survival. 
Yet, adherence to treatment is particularly challenging, as it entails 
consuming multiple drugs at once, over a long duration, and often in the 
face of strong side effects even after symptoms may have disappeared.2
To combat TB around the world, the World Health Organization promotes  
Directly Observed Therapy, Short Course (DOTS). Following DOTS, 
patients ingest their TB treatment under direct observation of trained 
providers based at local care centers. This decentralized provision of 
treatment requires that national TB programs have close oversight of 
service delivery. Delivering effective and efficient care, however, is 
often challenging where monitoring capacity, data quality, and internet 
connectivity are limited. 
One potential solution to improve the delivery of social services and reliability of administrative information is biometric identification 
of patients and health workers to track treatment adherence and to monitor provider performance. 
To test how biometric tracking affects service delivery and data quality, Thomas Bossuroy (World Bank), Clara Delavallade (World 
Bank), and Vincent Pons (Harvard Business School, J-PAL) randomized the placement of biometric devices in TB treatment centers in 
urban informal settlements across four Indian states.photo : shutterstock .comAbdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Labevaluations
India accounts for over 27 percent of global TB cases, with almost  
2.7 million cases diagnosed in 2018.1 Ninety-seven percent of all 
new TB cases can be effectively treated with first-line antibiotics, 
which in India are available at no cost to the patient. However, 
poor access to care, fear of social stigma, low levels of knowledge 
about the disease, and a stringent medication regimen make early 
detection and treatment adherence challenging. 
The Government of India implements the World Health 
Organization’s DOTS protocol through state- and district-level 
offices. It also has decentralized public-private partnerships with 
local NGOs. Health workers are tasked with detecting cases, 
directly observing patients taking their medication at DOTS 
centers, and rapidly following up with patients who miss a 
treatment dose. In India, DOTS centers employ a paper-based 
record system, making monitoring pill intake, treatment outcomes,  
and follow-up a time-consuming and error-prone process. 
Researchers partnered with Operation ASHA (OpASHA) to test 
the impact of a biometric tracking technology on TB treatment 
adherence, provider monitoring, and data quality. OpASHA is 
the largest NGO delivering primary care to TB patients in India 
and operates DOTS centers in several states. Their TB providers 
receive an average salary of Rs 5,600 (US$90 at the time of the 
evaluation) per month as well as financial bonuses based on the 
number of new TB cases they identify. 
In partnership with Microsoft Research India, OpASHA developed  
biometric tracking technology, eCompliance, using a tablet attached  
to a fingerprint scanner. The technology aimed to do the following:  
1) ensure patients themselves receive medication from health 
workers, 2) alert providers to follow up with patients who missed  
an appointment, 3) enable program managers to monitor health 
worker performance, and 4) reduce opportunities for misreporting  
patient data (Figure 1). Health workers and patients identify 
themselves when they come to the center. Data is sent daily via 
SMS to OpASHA’s server in Delhi, and alerts and reminders are 
sent to health workers when patients fail to take their doses. 
eCompliance is easy to use and is tailored for use in environments  
with limited internet connectivity. 
OpASHA randomly installed biometric devices in TB treatment 
centers in urban informal settlements across four states in 
Northern India. Of 65 OpASHA catchment areas, each with one 
2figure  1. integrating  biometric  tracking  into opasha 's 
tb service  deliveryhealth worker and serving nearly 40,000 individuals, 34 received 
biometric devices. The remaining 31 catchment areas did not 
receive biometric devices and served as the comparison group.
Over 12 to 14 months, researchers collected data from surveys 
given to all patients enrolled in OpASHA treatment centers, 
administrative data (e.g., official TB registers, treatment cards, 
OpASHA registers), and interviews with health workers and patients.  
They also conducted random clinic visits to assess provider 
attendance and day-long observations of medication adherence.

Centers with Biometric Tracking Comparison Centers
Note: Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. Statistically significant difference 
relative to the comparison group is noted at the 1% (***), 5% (**), or 10% (*) level.Biometric tracking increased patient adherence to TB treatment  
and the World Health Organization’s DOTS protocol.  Patients 
seeking treatment in a center with biometric tracking were 1.8 
percentage points (25 percent) less likely to default, defined as 
missing medication doses for two months or more or not completing  
four months of treatment, compared to 7.3 percent of patients 
enrolled in centers without such monitoring. Biometric tracking 
increased compliance with DOTS requirements: in-person pill 
intake increased by 13.9 percentage points (26 percent) and 
patients were 21.8 percentage points (60 percent) less likely to 
send another person to pick up medication on their behalf.
Biometric tracking did not, however, impact other dimensions  
of patient health. There was no difference in cure rates, symptoms,  
mental health, or emotional health between centers with and 
without biometric tracking. This lack of impact may be explained 
by the focus on preventing patients from defaulting. These patients  
accounted for a small share of patients included in this study 
(with default rates at 7.3 percent of the control group). Thus, 
average improvements in patient health would have been unlikely.
Greater health worker effort was a major factor in increased 
adherence to TB treatment. Provider attendance increased 
by up to 12 percent at centers (about 7 percentage points) and 
time spent at centers increased by 19 percent (about 22 minutes 
per day). The frequency of home visits to patients who missed 
their dosages increased by 32 percent (about 4 percentage 
points). This may be explained by more stringent oversight 
from OpASHA management. There was no evidence that health 
workers strategically avoided patients with a perceived higher 
risk of defaulting or reduced patient detection efforts.
Biometric devices improved the accuracy of NGO health 
records and official government health registers.  Absent 
proper monitoring, health workers’ compensation schemes may 
incentivize them to inflate the number of TB detections. The 
biometric tracking devices decreased overreporting of new TB 
cases by 20 percent. Underreporting of treatment interruptions 
decreased by 25 percent when comparing patients' actual 
probability of default to OpASHA data and government TB registers. 
Health worker and patient satisfaction did not decrease 
despite biometric technology imposing additional constraints.  
More accurate recordkeeping reduced bonuses for new detections  
and resulted in a 7 percent decline (Rs 429 or US$7) in health 
worker income. Still, biometric monitoring did not reduce job 
satisfaction and remained in use in over 75 percent of the centers 
five months after introduction. The devices reduced concerns of 
excessive workload by half (10.5 percentage points) by saving 
health workers time cross-checking patient records to gather data 
on treatment adherence and outcomes. Despite having to go to the  
center more frequently to scan their fingerprints to receive 
medication, as opposed to sending a relative on their behalf, patients  
did not report lower levels of satisfaction with their treatment.

Real-time tracking of service providers and users can simplify service delivery and improve provider effort.  Additional evaluations 
from India show that technology-based attendance monitoring improved teacher and health care provider performance.3,4,5 However, these 
monitoring systems can be undermined over time if there is not broader organizational support for them.3,5 In this evaluation, monitoring 
devices were not met with strong resistance, most likely because they reduced provider workloads by facilitating patient tracking. 
Improving provider job performance can be a viable strategy to boost medication adherence. Many interventions have tested 
behavioral nudges for patients to promote pill intake, for instance via SMS reminders or tailored information on pill packaging.6,7,8 Improving  
health worker performance can also increase medication adherence by reducing supply-side constraints such as access to quality care.
Biometric identification improves recordkeeping and quality of administrative data.  Evaluations in Indonesia and India suggest that  
top-down monitoring systems can reduce the misreporting of data and corruption.9,10,11 Notably, this biometric tracking system enables 
monitoring of service delivery and measurement of program outputs via a tablet linked to a fingerprint scanner instead of by in-person 
government or third-party auditors, leaving little room for misreporting.

As a next step, researchers are interested in exploring the impact of biometric data systems on service delivery and state capacity beyond 
TB treatment.
