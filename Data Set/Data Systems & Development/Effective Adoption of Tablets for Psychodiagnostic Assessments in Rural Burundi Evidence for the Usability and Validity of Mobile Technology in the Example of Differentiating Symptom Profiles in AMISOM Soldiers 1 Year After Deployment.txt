Research on the use of mobile technology in health sciences h as identiﬁed several
advantages of so-called mHealth (mobile health) applicati ons. Tablet-supported clinical
assessments are becoming more and more prominent in clinica l applications, even in
low-income countries. The present study used tablet comput ers for assessments of
clinical symptom proﬁles in a sample of Burundian AMISOM sol diers (i.e., African Union
Mission to Somalia; a mission approved by the UN). The study a imed to demonstrate
the feasibility of mHealth-supported assessments in ﬁeld r esearch in Burundi. The study
was conducted in a resource-poor setting, in which tablet co mputers are predestined
to gather data in an efﬁcient and reliable manner. The overal l goal was to prove the
validity of the obtained data as well as the feasibility of th e chosen study setting. Four

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, more and more studies and meta-analyses have
investigated and shown the usefulness of mobile technology
in psychological research, clinical assessments, and thera peutic
interventions [e.g., ( 1,2)]. In particular, digital assessments and
interventions oﬀer several advantages but also challenges [ e.g.,
(3,4)]. On the one hand, the collection of data can be improved
by reducing time eﬀorts and resources, especially when large
data sets have to be processed in a rather short period of time
(5). On the other hand, a suitable infrastructure has to be
provided, additional development costs have to be covered, an d
datasecurityissuesmustbeaddressed[e.g.,( 6,7)].
However, the implementation of mobile health (mHealth)
applications is not solely bound to practical issues. The valid ity
of the gathered data via mobile devices has to be considered
carefully.Astheproliferationofmobiletechnologyhasinc reased
by orders of magnitude, more and more researchers address
validity issues in the context of mHealth-collected data. I n
the beginning of the development of mHealth applications, no
guidelines existed on how interventions based on mHealth ha ve
to be reported in scientiﬁc applications, making it diﬃcult to
compare the quality of research designs. The World Health
Organization (WHO) mHealth Technical Evidence Review
Group therefore developed the mHealth evidence reporting and
assessment (mERA) checklist in 2016, covering 16 items to
be addressed when reporting mHealth applications in scientiﬁc
publications( 8).
Although extant research on mHealth mostly stems from
western countries, several studies in resource-poor countr ies
have emerged in recent years that used mobile technology;
e.g., in the East African countries Burundi, Rwanda, and
Uganda [e.g., ( 9–11)]. The latter studies covered aspects on
interventions as well as diagnostic questions. This demons trates
thatmHealthdoesnothavetobelimitedtostudiesinﬁrst-wo rld
countries, but can be applied all over the world. The validity
of the psychodiagnostic assessments, however, is a substant ial
and necessary prerequisite for any further clinical researc h for
example on interventions based on mHealth applications and
mobile technology. Therefore, the use of mobile technology
is demonstrated in this paper based on psychodiagnostic
assessments in a sample of Burundian soldiers. The conducted
studyutilizedtabletcomputerstocarryoutstandardizedcl inical
interviews digitally. Instead of solely focusing on the use rs’
willingness to use a mobile application, this paper aims to
demonstrate - on the basis of a data-driven approach - that
the gathered data is valid and suitable for further clinical
researchquestions.There is a considerable amount of public attention on
psychologicalconsequencesofmentalhealthproblemsinsold iers
in the aftermath of their deployment ( 12,13). Among the
various disorders reported in the literature, the post-trauma tic-
stress disorder (PTSD) and depression are among the most
commonones( 14).Whilesomestudiesprimarilyfocusoneither
depression ( 15) or PTSD symptoms ( 16), others acknowledge
the high comorbidity between the two disorders ( 17). Although
the relation between PTSD and depression in soldiers after
deployment is still under debate ( 18), it is reasonable to assume
that diﬀerent subgroups of soldiers exist. In these subgroups,
in turn, soldiers might either display predominant PTSD or
depressionsymptoms,orsuﬀerfrombothofthem(comorbidity).
The present study therefore investigated whether or not disti nct
depression and PTSD symptom proﬁles can be identiﬁed in
AMISOM(AfricanUnionMissiontoSomalia)soldiers,basedon
atablet-supporteddatacollectionsolution.
The AMISOM ( 19,20) is a UN Security Council authorized
peacekeeping mission, sending military troops based in Uganda ,
Kenya, Burundi, Djibouti, and Ethiopia to stabilize Somalia
and try to reclaim territories from the Al-Shabaab militia.
AMISOM troops frequently cope with attacks and armed ﬁghts
in a hostile environment. Beside mission related hassles, m ost
Burundian soldiers experience a civil war that already start ed
in 1993 and lasted more than a decade ( 21–24). During this
period, the currently active Burundian soldiers often must ﬁ ght
against each other, including ﬁghts with former government
troopsorrebelmovements.Asaconsequenceoftheseparticular
circumstances, the aﬀected population is challenged with seve re
traumas.Therefore,itispromising–andrequired-toinvest igate
trauma- and deployment related mental-health consequences i n
thesepeople.
The aim of this study was not only to demonstrate the
general feasibility of structured clinical interviews in a l ow-
income country that are accomplished through the use of tablet
computers. On top of that, privacy concerns are discussed ( 25),
which might have an impact on the participation in tablet
computer guided interviews, leading to a general tendency
to either disclose information or producing meaningless or
invalid data. As an approach to validate the experts’ ratings
conducted in this study, it was tested, whether analyses of
the collected data are capable to diﬀerentiate distinct symptom
proﬁlesinPTSDanddepressionsymptoms.Altogether,asample
of 463 participants from the AMISOM was investigated 1 year
after their deployment. A latent proﬁle analyses (LPA) was
conducted to separate diﬀerent symptom proﬁle groups. We
expectedtoidentifydistinctdiagnosticgroupsaccordingtoP TSD

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
The tabled-based diagnostic procedure was accomplished in a
larger project aiming to improve the mental health status of
Burundian soldiers of the AMISOM mission [for further detail s
on PTSD rates and speciﬁc types of trauma-exposure pre- and
peri-deployment see ( 17)]. The composition of the survey was
limited to PTSD and depression as main psychiatric disorders
andwasprimarilyconcernedwiththeassessmentofdeployment -
associated risk factors. In general, this sample was exposed to
various traumatic pre-deployment events [Median =11 (17)],
many of them thereby related to the Burundian civil war.
Many of the sample have faced traumatic incidents during thei r
deployment [Median =5 (17)], including being attacked by
an enemy, experiencing suicide attack, or witnessing comrad es
beingkilled.

thetargetpopulation.
Study Procedure
Clinical symptoms were assessed using standardized clinica l
interviews,guidedbyasurveyimplementedfortabletcompute rs
(i.e., Apple ipads). All participants were released from their
routine duty for the interviews. To ensure anonymity and
conﬁdentiality, electronic coding and storage of the data
was utilized, which fulﬁlled the highest and most secure
data encryption standards ( 7). Before their application in the
interviews, all questionnaires had been translated into Ki rundi,
using back and forth translations ( 26). Trained mental health
experts from Burundi and Germany conducted all interviews
in Kirundi, so that literacy was not an issue. Bi-lingual loca l
interpreters supported the German mental health experts. All
questionnaires were translated from English into Kirundi u sing
back-and-forth translations. All translations were discu ssed in
an experts’ panel consisting of bi-lingual translators as wel l as
mental health experts from Burundi and Germany. Assessmentswere conducted in diﬀerent military camps of the Burundian
army and lasted about 2h. Separate barracks were provided for
the implementation of the research project by the Burundian
army and interviews were conducted individually to prevent
any undue inﬂuence or the issue of stigma, which could have
resultedfromgroup-basedassessments.Interviewersentere dthe
participants’ responses into the iPad and probed the responses
priortotherating.
All questionnaires and scales were administered on tablet
computers,usingthesoftwareandtechnicalequipmentdescri bed
below. Only written informed consent was collected by
paper-pencil mode. Interviews were carried out in a private
space between the participant, the clinical interviewer, and
if necessary, by a local interpreter. Clinical interviewers had
to rate symptoms and responses using the tablet computers.
Experienced international and local clinical psychologists, an d
Burundian psychology students, who had been – just like the
interpreters - excessively trained in mental health concepts ,
werecontinuouslysupervisedduringtheassessmentperiod,a nd
carried out the diagnostic interviews. Ongoing intervision and
rotating supervisors, which attended the interviews at rand om,
ensuredahighqualityoftheinterviews.
Assessment of Posttraumatic Stress
Symptoms
The ﬁfth version of the PTSD Symptom Scale Interview [PSS-I;
(27)] was administered for the assessment of PTSD symptoms.
It is a 20-item interview that assesses each symptom of the
DSM-5 during the past month for severity and frequency.
However, due to the necessity to keep the results comparable
to previous assessments, the response options for each item
ranged in accordance with the DSM-IV version on a four-
point Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 3 (ﬁve or more times
per week/almost always), instead of the newly adapted ﬁve-
point Likert scale of the DSM-5 version. The PSS-I has proven
its validity already in an application with soldiers from the
Burundian Army prior to their deployment and in a sample of
formerBurundiancombatants( 28).Homogeneityinthepresent
sample was satisfying (Cronbach’s Alpha =0.89). To conduct
latent proﬁle analysis (LPA), individual item scores were used .
To distinguish class proﬁles, sub-scores for the DSM B (PSS-
I re-experiencing), C (avoidance), D (PSS-I negative changes
in cognition and mood) and E (PSS-I increased arousal and
reactivity), criteria across classes were compared. Mean PSS-
I score in the present study was 4.4 ( SD=6.1); clusters:
reexperiencing ( M=1.1,SD=2.0), avoidance ( M=0.6,SD=
1.0), negative changes in cognition and mood ( M=1.1,SD=
2.1),andincreasedarousalandreactivity( M=1.3,SD=2.1).
Assessment of Depression Symptoms
Depression symptoms were assessed with the Patient Health
Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), a well validated, and short severi ty
measure of depression [cf. ( 29)]. The PHQ-9 was originally
designed as a self-rating instrument, but has been successf ully
implemented in clinical interviews as well ( 14). For the
identiﬁcation of symptom proﬁles in the LPA, individual items
were included in the analysis. However, for the speciﬁcation o f

class characteristics, class diﬀerences in the PHQ-9 sum sco re
were analyzed. Therefore, the item scores for the assessmen t of
symptom frequency were summed up ( M=2.7,SD=3.7).

Mobile Devices
The data collection procedure was performed using mobile
devices. As a new iOS tablet application with particular
characteristics was developed for this study, some aspects of
more general interest are shortly discussed. The overall ti me to
develop the mobile application was rather tight (i.e., roughl y
8 weeks), therefore an approach from computer science was
chosen that is called rapid prototyping [cf. ( 30)]. However, only
using this well-known approach was not suﬃcient enough in
the end, more ideas had to be created and technically carried
out to cope with the challenges of the study. As it turned out
thattheapplicationhadtobechangedfrequentlyon-site,hav ing
in mind that often no internet connection is available and th e
computer scientists were not present in Africa, a procedure had
to be found to transfer application changes from Germany to
Burundi. The reasons for these change demands were mainly
due to language issues, new interview functions (e.g., feat ure to
quicklyjotdownnotes),oruserinterfacechanges.Besideo n-site
changes,itwaschallengingtocopewithrequirementspertain ing
to the provided procedure how questionnaires are ﬁlled out
by the psychologists. They wanted features to navigate throu gh

as well as securely transferred for statistical analyzes, wa s also

This included implementation eﬀorts as well as training eﬀorts
between the psychologists and the computer scientists. Final ly,
note that the mobile application was not installed to the used

application was directly installed to the iPads; i.e., before the

purpose, data was anonymized and encrypted. For encryption
purposes, the AES-256 encryption algorithm was used ( 31).
Second, a multi-user feature was implemented to distinguish
between interviewers and administrators. The latter were t he
only entitled persons to decrypt all locally store data. There fore,
administratorshadtheirownareawithinthemobileapplicatio n,
which was also secured with a password. To secure the data
transfer procedure even more strictly, the data transfer was only
possible from the iPads to a stationary PC in this administrat or
area using iTunes. Third, applications adaptions during the da tacollection procedure became actually necessary. Technical ly, if
adaptions had to be carried out, they were accomplished using
an SVN server ( 32) to which the psychologists in Burundi
had remote access. To properly use this access method, the

Data Analysis
The data analysis was conducted in two steps. First, a latent
proﬁle analysis (LPA) ( 33) was performed to identify subgroups
of soldiers based on the PHQ-9 and PSS-I items, accounting
for depression and PTSD symptoms simultaneously. The LPA
was conducted using Mplus 7 for Mac. A LPA uses latent
categoricalvariablestoidentifygroupsofindividualswit hsimilar
symptom patterns (classes) on a set of clinical variables. In
comparison to other statistical approaches that aim to identif y
groups of participants within a dataset, like a cluster analysis ,
LPA has several advantages, in particular the “availability of
more rigorous empirical criteria for determining the number of
clusters”( 34).Duetopositivelyskewed,over-dispersed,andnon-
normally distributed outcome data, a negative binomial mode l
waspreferredoverlinearorPoissonregressionmodels.Applyin g
azero-inﬂatednegativebinomialmodeltothedatawasdisca rded
due to unacceptable ﬁt indices. For the appropriate assignment
of class labels, one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were
conducted with group membership as the independent variable
and depression as well as PTSD symptom severity as dependent
variables. For the selection of the appropriate number of classe s,
Lo–Mendell–Rubin-adjusted likelihood ratio tests (LMR-A) as
well as bootstrap likelihood ratio test (BLRT) were calcula ted,
indicating the superiority of the ﬁnal model in comparison to

Thus, the results revealed four classes with distinct sympto m
proﬁles. Class 1 (low overall symptoms) had the lowest scores
on all mental health measures, whereas Class 4 (high overall
symptoms)hadthehighestsymptomsscoresonboth,depression
and PTSD scales. Participants in Class 2 (moderate PTSD)
showed moderate PTSD symptoms, and in comparison, to the
other three groups, low to almost no depression symptoms.
Class 3 (moderate depression) was characterized by moderate
depressionsymptomsandlowtoalmostnoPTSDsymptoms.
DISCUSSION
The results of this study emphasize the feasibility of tablet -
assisted clinical interviews assessing mental health sympt oms
in resource-poor post-conﬂict regions, such as Burundi. Usin g
a latent class analysis, we identiﬁed four diﬀerent symptom
cluster groups amongst Burundian soldiers in a 1-year follow-
up after the deployment in AMISOM. Those cluster groups
includedalowoverallsymptomproﬁle,amoderatePTSDproﬁle,
a moderate depression proﬁle, and within a minority, a high
overall-symptomproﬁle.
These ﬁndings indicate that mental health symptoms related
to depression and PTSD are clustered in a similar way as wewouldexpectamongstsoldiersfromhigh-incomecountriesaf ter
deployment ( 35,39–42). This result could indicate that mental
healthsymptomsasareactiontotraumaticand/ordailystres sors
might be indeed similar between diﬀerent cultures ( 13). The
resultsaddtothemountingevidencethatmentalhealthconc epts
and assessment tools developed in high-income cultures can
be successfully adapted to diﬀerent cultural backgrounds ( 13).

The majority of the participants had little to no experience
withtabletspriortothismentalhealthproject,andmanyofth em
hadlittleschooleducation.Nevertheless,theuseoftablet sinthe
clinical interviews seems not to have aﬀected their willingn ess
to talk about their mental health problems with clinical menta l
health experts in a way, which provides meaningful results. Thi s
conclusion is very promising and might allow researchers and
mental health services in resource-poor countries to use mobi le
technology for meaningful assessments and service provision s.
As technology will get more accessible and its’ use more usual
in every culture in the future, overcoming possible remainin g
obstacles, such as unfamiliarity with use for self-assessme nts,
and/orlackofalphabetisation,seemsverylikely.
However, while we could identify four clearly distinct
symptom proﬁles, the mental health symptoms were not that
pronouncedinindividualsofoursample.Takingthemeanvalues
of PTSD symptoms ( M=4.4) and depression symptoms ( M
=2.7) into account, we have to acknowledge that we either
assessed a highly resilient group of individuals, the major ity
of whom did not develop severe mental symptoms despite
their signiﬁcant exposure to traumatic stress and violence, or
that the soldiers underreported some of their mental health
symptoms. Most likely, both of these potential explanations
contribute to the low reported symptom scores. The soldiers we
assessed remained in the Burundian army after the end of the
civil war, when many of those severely aﬀected by injuries had
been demobilized. The soldiers continuously took beneﬁt fro m
unit support and relative income stability resulting from the ir
status. Furthermore, they have been less exposed to traumatic
experiences than their demobilized colleagues, and might ha ve
beenparticularlyadaptedtotraumaticandviolentenvironme nts
(28). However, mental health problems are also associated with
stigma, particularly amongst soldiers. For some of the soldi ers,
symptoms might be underreported due to the necessity being
regarded as strong and functional soldiers, and to avoid any
risk of demobilization. Even though, we informed them that
no individual information would be passed on to superiors,
nevertheless, comprehensibly, a certain mistrust remained. The
fact that we successfully identiﬁed the four symptoms clusters
despite the low symptom Scores, might indicate that those
symptomshavebeeninfactunderreported.Hence,sophisticate d
statistical methods, such as latent class analysis, help to b etter
understand underlying properties of data that would otherwise
not be detectable, thereby conﬁrming reliability and valid ity of

Other analyses methods could be applied to expand the
results of the latent class analysis. For example, machine-
learning methods could be used to re-evaluate the classes.
Based on the number of variables and participants, several
machine learning approaches could be a valuable target (e.g.,support vector machines). One limitation of this study is that
professionals interviewed and entered the data for the soldi ers.
In consequence, participants might have been less open to
report about their mental health symptoms, as research from
high-income countries indicates that participants generall y tend
Frontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 7 April 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 490604Weierstall et al. Effective Adoption of Tablets in Rural Burundi
to be more honest when providing their answers directly to a
digital solution [cf. ( 38)]. Possibly, this circumstance could be
improved in the future with more literate samples, although
it remains unclear if the reporting bias identiﬁed within hig h-
income countries toward more openness is the same within
cultures less exposed to technology when reporting health iss ues
to a machine. Another shortcoming relates to the fact that th e
same measures were used for identifying and validating the
proﬁles. After a set of PTSD and depression measures is used
to empirically determine proﬁles, using a new set of PTSD and
depression measures to validate the proﬁles would provide a
strongervalidationapproach.
However, it was striking during this study that the mobile
application has several beneﬁts compared to a traditional paper-
based study. A higher amount of collected data in a rather
short time and with higher data quality could be achieved.
Regarding the data quality, transcription errors are minimiz ed
since a procedure to digitize the data is no longer necessary. In
addition, by easily switching between diﬀerent languages fo r a
questionnaire, the collection procedure could be also improv ed
since translation issues could be mitigated. For example, a
psychologist can always toggle between languages if needed,
which eases the understanding of questions at hand. Finally ,
being a challenge from the software engineering perspective,
mobile applications that are used for studies must ensure that

CONCLUSION
With the present study, it could be demonstrated that mobile
technology can enable clinical studies in a new, reliable,
and innovative way, especially when studies are carried out
in challenging environments. In particular, studies can be
conducted in a rather short time with many advantages
compared to traditional paper-based studies. For example, by
gatheringlargeramountsofdataandwithlessrequiredreso urces
when using tablet computers or smartphones. In addition,
the application of recently emerging analysis methods like
machine learning become more easily possible. This study has
demonstrated that mobile technology is able to produce data
sets, which are valuable and feasible for innovative analysi s
methods. However, the use of mobile technology also causeschallenges that must be considered carefully. As this study
showed that the implemented mobile application for the Apple
iPad is able to reveal new and valuable research insights in t he
context of a large-scale study in a resource-poor setting, th e
