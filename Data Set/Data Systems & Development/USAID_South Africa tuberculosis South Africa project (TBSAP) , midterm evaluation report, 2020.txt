 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
Evaluat ion Purpose and Eva luation Questions  
The purpose of the Tubercul osis Sout h Africa Project  (TBSAP ) midterm evaluation is to examine how 
the project’s interventions helped achieve the Nationa l Department of Health (NDo H) and the United 
States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) Mission’s goal to reduce the tuber culosis ( TB) 
burden in South Africa and to identify areas for improvement. There are three specific evalua tion 
objectives:  
1. To determine the degree or extent to which the TBSAP responds to the Government of South 
Africa’s (G OSA) TB priorities (National Str ategic Plan 2 017‒2022 and National TB Program 
Strategic Plan 2017 ‒2021) . 
2. To identify key lessons learned, best practices , and challenges that will inform the strategic 
design of the follow -on TB project. 
3. To lear n from the midterm successes and challenges of t he TBSA P and recommend course 
corrections for the final year  of the project.  
 
The following key questio ns guided this midterm evaluation: 
1. To what extent has TBSAP been effective/succ essful in achieving its st ated objectives and 
targets? 
2. What key interventi ons and  activities have been most effective/high impact in achieving results? 
(Which are least o r less effective?)  
3. What challenges and constraints did the project face and what course corrections might 
improv e this?  
4. What has changed in the epidemiology and  enviro nment of TB in South Africa, and how has this 
affected the program? 
Project Background  
South Afr ica is one of 14 countries considered to be a high -burden country by the World Health 
Organization ( WHO ) for TB, TB/HIV, and multidrug -resistant TB ( MDR- TB).1 In 2018, WHO  estimated 
that South Africa had  an incidence of 301,000 cases of active TB, o r 520 per 100,000 population.2 
Approximately 11,000 people became ill with MDR -TB/ rifampicin -resistant TB ( RR-TB) that year.3 The 
2018 statistics documented th at 59 percent of new and relapse TB cases were coinfected with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV ),4 further exacerbating the challenges of providing treatment and care to 
patients.  
 
South Africa’s TB program has made progress sustaining trends to  reduc e mortality due to TB; lowering

 TB incidence rates, including redu cing the incid ence of co -diagnose d TB/HIV; and imp roving treatment 
success rates for most categories of cases. However, challenges remain before South Africa can reach its 
TB eliminatio n goa ls, with the country  falling short of the 2025 End TB goals.  
 
The overarching  goal of the TBSAP i s to reduce the national TB, M DR-TB/e xtensively drug-resistant TB 
(XDR- TB), and TB/HIV burden in  South Africa. The primary objectives of the project  are to: (1) reduce 
TB in fections; (2) increase the sustainability of effective TB response s ystems ; and ( 3) improv e care and 
treatment of vulnerable populations.  TBSAP  contributes to th e achievement o f the USAID M ission’s 
Development Objective 1: “ Health outcomes for  South Africans improved ,” as expressed in the 
Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS). It also respo nds to the Government of South 
Africa National Strategic Plan for HIV, TB and STIs  (2017‒2022) and National TB  Program Strategic Plan 
(2017‒2021); United States  Government Global TB S trategy (2015 ‒2019); and the White House 
National Action Plan to Combat Multidrug -Resistant TB (Goal 2) : improving international capacity and 
collaboratio n to co mbat multidrug -resista nt tuberculosis (MDR -TB). 
Evaluation Design, Metho ds and Limitations  
The mi dterm evaluation was conducted from December 4, 2019 to August 31, 2020, covering the 
period from the TBSAP’s inception in March 2016 through September 2019.  It used a mixed methods 
methodology of pri mary and secondary  qualitative and quantitative data col lection and analysis. Eight of 
the 14 TBSAP intervention districts across  the six provinces were selected for key informant interviews 
(KIIs): four hig h burde n TB districts , two medium burden, a nd two low burden.  A quasi -experimental 
comparison of key indicators was also conducted using eight comparison districts matched to the eight 
TBSAP districts. In addition , the team did a comprehensive literature re view of  key TBSAP documents 
and GOSA and US Government (USG) policy docum ents. The C OVID-19 pandemic and response 
prohibited the team’s travel to the field. This constraint required the team to conduct interviews 
remotely. Moreover, data could not be collected  directly from facilities, limiting the overall analysis to 
the distr ict level only, and the resulting quantitative analysis.  
Findings and Conclusions  
The TBSAP’s overall goal is  to con tribute to the redu ction of the TB burden in South Africa, which will 
be achieve d through progress in four outcome i ndicators, and other key in dicators across the TB 
cascade. The TBSAP  achieved i ts fiscal year (FY)19 target f or one of its four outcome indicators : drug-
resistant TB (DR- TB) treatment initiation. The project was c lose to  achieving its DR -TB treatment 
success target, and approximatel y 10 pe rcentage points lower that its targets for both drug- suscepti ble 
(DS) TB (DS-TB) treatment success and antiretroviral therapy (ART) cover age for TB/HIV c oinfected 
clients. The TBSAP performed well in TB screening and t esting, with variable pe rformance in rates  of 
clients lost to follow -up (LTFU) . 
 The DS- TB treatment success rate and ART initiation among TB clients were affected by data entry and 
data quality issues . In 2017, the s elected data elements of the TB modu le trans itioned between two of  
South Africa’s  health information systems, from ETR.net to TIER.Net, with as sociated data and system 
errors. This change resulted in a similar downward trend in th e national TB data during this perio d. 
Moreover, the TBSAP  noted a ten dency to prioritize HI V program data for entry in TIER.Net, with data 
entry backlogs at multiple si tes. The project is implementing data clean -up and other measures across its 
districts to mitigate these challeng es. A contributing factor in the underperfo rmance on ART initiatio n 
among TB clie nts cited by the project was differences in data reporting pr otocols  in the Western Cap e 
province (West Coast, City of Cape Town, and Cape Winelands  districts), which reported  ART 
initiations with TB outcomes and not w ith case finding.  
 
The TBSA P is align ed with and re sponsiv e to global  and USG guidelines and strategies , and to GOSA  
5 | Page  
 strategies a nd pol icies. Several  TBSAP interventions are current ly being scaled  up, integrated , and 
institutionalized in  national policy . 
 
The TBSAP has implemented sev eral key interventions and activiti es that have had a positi ve effect on 
TB outcomes in the selected districts. The evaluation team assessed the effectiveness of TBSAP 
intervention s based on tw o factors:  performance indicato rs that could be linked to a s pecific activity, 
and the frequency w ith whi ch specific interv entions were mentioned as project successes or strengths 
during the qualitative interviews. B ased on these criter ia, the  three most effective interventions were: 
(1) building partnerships for mult isectoral accountability; (2) infec tion pr evention and contr ol (IPC) 
activiti es; and (3) continuous q uality improvement (CQI) . Less effective interventio ns were: (1) 
informa tion sy stem managem ent; (2) advocacy, communication s, and social mobilization (AC SM); and (3) 
the ConnecTB app.  
 The TBSAP’s technical assistan ce model has been  well received by all districts supported. However, 
challenges related to pr oject design and man agement have inhibi ted the project and may have 
unintentionally prevented it from  reaching scale and delivering fully on  its targets. The chall enges became 
constraints over the course of the project. They are : (1) TBSAP contract and management; (2) sub -
grantee m anagement; an d (3) human resource allocation d uring project planning. The pro ject also 
experienced several constra ints related to South A frica’s health sy stems, outside its contr ol, which 
posed considerable challenges to its success. They are: (1) in formati on system ma nagement; (2) funding 
and resour ce constraints; (3) ongoing ca pacity development needs; and (4) geo graphical and 
socioeconom ic factors.  
 Although key data sources on  TB epidemiology in South Africa (such as the latest National TB 
Prevale nce Stu dy and 2018 a nd 2019 TB data sets) are pendi ng public release, TB program po licy 
changes indicate the integrati on and uptake of advances  in DR- TB treatment and decentralized ser vice 
delivery. However, the COVID- 19 pandemic has ad versely affected the N ational Tuberculo sis Program 
(NTP) in terms of ma nagement, resource allocation (i ncluding human resources), and serv ice delivery, 
with significant losses in TB outcomes across the cascade. The TBSAP has contributed to the national 
COV ID-19 response, such as scr eening and e ducation efforts, and leveraged i ts existing IPC  and capacity 
building measures to strengthen the h ealth system at the facil ity level.  
Recomm endations 
The TBSAP ends  in March 2021 and USAID has started the planning  process for the design  of its follow -
on TB project. Th is evaluation offer s recommendations for key stakeh olders  in the short, medium , and 
long term , as summarized be low.  
 Short- term recommendations for USAID and TBSAP through the end of TBSAP’s contract i n March 
2021 include : (1) intensi fied, direct support to the NTP in data m anagement and systems; (2) fast-track 
approval a nd continuity of n on-governmental organiza tion (NGO ) contracts; (3) l everag ing TBSAP 
strength s to help the NTP adapt to the COVID- 19 pandemic; and ( 4) TBSAP documenta tion of end of 
project results  and transition plans . 
 M
edium -term recom mend ations for USAID to ensure consistency o f support in TBSA P’s 14 high TB 
burden districts include: (1) a n ext ension to TBSAP’s contra ct, from April 2021 through the anticipated 
start date of USAID’s follow -on project(s) ; (2) c oordination with the DoH an d TBSAP to ensure 
USAID’s contract extension includes coverag e of high -impact  priority interventions to sustain  gains in 
TB outcomes achieved in the last five years; (3) a lignment of key  interventions with the NTP’s “ TB 
Recovery Plan” in response to COVID-19. 
  
6 | Page  
 Long-term recommendations for USAID in the design of its follow -on TB project(s)  include: (1) a 
cooperativ e agreement as a more appropriate and flexible funding mechanism , especiall y in the context 
of COVID- 19; (2) a comprehensive indicator set with app ropriate measures of project accountability; 
(3) building  on successful approaches from the TBSAP, including the Finding TB A ctively, Separating 
safely, Treating effectively  (FAST ) approach and CQI; ( 4) build on and expand public -private engagement 
and p artnerships; (5) ensure continuity of NGO contri butions; and (6) strengthen TB/HIV/COVID -19 
integration and coordination for improved program outcomes.  
 
Recommendations for the NDoH inc lude: (1) address the country’s information management system 
challenge s; (2) oversee an assessment of and manage heal th syst em software applicatio ns; and (3) 
strengthen NTP coordination and ACSM.

 EVALUATION PURPOSE & 
EVALUATION QU ESTION S 
The purpose o f the Tuberculosis Sout h Africa Project ( TBSAP ) midterm evaluation, as  stated in the 
Scope of W ork (Annex I ), is to examine how the project’s interventions contributed to  the National  
Department of Health (NDo H) and the Unit ed States Agency for In ternational Development ( USAID ) 
Mission’s goal to reduc e the tuberculosi s (TB) burden in South A frica and to identify ar eas for 
improvement. There are three specific evaluation objecti ves:  
1. To determine th e degree or extent to which t he TBSAP responds to th e Government o f South 
Africa’s (G OSA) TB prioriti es (National Stra tegic Plan 2017 ‒2022 and National TB Program 
Strategi c Plan 2017‒2021) . 
2. To identify key lessons learned, best practices, and challenges that will inform the strategic 
design of the follow -on TB project. 
3. To learn from the midterm successes and challenges of  the TBSAP and recommend course 
corrections for the f inal year of the project.  
 
The target audiences for this evaluation are : 
• USAID/South Africa and the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS R elief (PEPFAR ) 
• GOSA, ND oH, and National Tuberculosis  Program (NTP) stakeholders at all levels  
• Other donor s, implementing partners , and key stakeholders engaged in TB prevention and care 
 The TBSAP midterm evaluation con solidate s lessons learned , collaborat ion, and adaptation across the 
project, identifying key f actors, in terventions , and investments that contribu te to the successes and 
challenges in reducing the burden of TB in South Africa. The evaluation also documents opportunities 
for future improvements , including possible approaches be yond the scope of  current activi ties.  
 
Findings and recommendations f rom this evaluation will inform course corrections in TBSAP ’s final year , 
and USAID/South Africa’s design and inve stments in future T B projects and interventions. The r esults of 
this eva luation will c ontribute to the learning agenda for TB for USAID/South Afri ca’s Country 
Development Cooperation Strategy  (CDCS) , and will assist the ND oH and other G OSA stakeholders 
to better identify the most effective approaches and intervention s, with the continued goal of red ucing 
the burden of  TB across Sout h Africa.  
The fol lowing key questions guided this evaluation, as outlined in the Scope of Work ( Annex I ): 
1. To what extent has TBSAP been effective/successful in achievin g its stated objectives and 
targets? 
2. What key interv entions and act ivities have been most effective/high impact in achieving results? 
(Which are least or less effective?)  
3. What challenges and constraints did the project face and what course corrections m ight 
improve this?  
4. What h as change d in the epidemiology  and environmen t of T B in South Africa, and how has this 
affected the program?

 PROJECT BACKGROUND
TB Burden in South Africa  
South Africa is one of 14 countries considered to be a high -burden country by the World Health 
Organi zation ( WHO) for TB, TB/HIV, and multidrug -resista nt TB ( MDR- TB).5 In 2018, WHO  estimated  
that South Africa had  an incidence of 301,000 cases of active TB, or 52 0 per 100,000 population.6 
Approximately 11,000 people became ill with  MDR-TB/ rifampicin -resistant TB ( RR-TB) that year.7 The 
2018 statistics do cumented that 59 percent of  new and rel apse TB cases were coinfected with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) ,8 further exacerbating the challenges of providing treatment and care to  
patients.  
 
The TB progr am has ma de progress in sustaining trends to reduc e TB mortality. This has been done by 
lowering TB incidence rates, including reducing the incidence of co -diagn osed TB /HIV; and improving 
treatment success rates for most categories  of cases. WHO confirms a  clear an d sustained downward 
trend in TB case noti fications in South Africa, which may be driven by high antiretroviral treatment 
(ART) coverage rates.  Of the 1 20,862 TB patients who were known to be HIV -positive in 2018, 10 4,625 
(87%) were reported to be on ART.9 Moreover, 65 percent of HIV -positive peo ple newly enrolled in 
HIV care were on TB preventive treatment that same year .10   
 
However, challenges remain before South Africa can achieve  its TB elimination goals.  The country i s 
falling short of the 2025 End TB  goals. Treatment coverage was 68  percent in 2017 and the treatment 
success rate was 82  percent. In 2017 , South Africa reported that of the 15,986 laboratory confirmed 
MDR- TB/RR-TB cases, only 10,259 (64%) began treatment.  Moreover , the treatment success r ate in 
2016 of 54  percent for patients wi th MDR- TB remains low .11 
 
South Afri ca’s TB efforts are primarily  funded by domestic sources , at 87 percent, and  the remaining 13 
percent from international sources .12 
The Tuberculosis South A frica Project  
The TBSAP is a  five-year (March 2016 ‒March 2021)  project funded by  USAID/South Africa. It h as a 
funding ceiling of $64,800,000. TBSAP’s overarching goal is to reduce the burden of TB, M DR-TB/ 
extensively drug -resistant TB ( XDR- TB), and TB/HIV in So uth Africa. The primary objectives of the 
project are to: (1) reduce TB infecti ons; (2) increase the sustainability of effective TB response systems;

 EVALUATIO N METHODS & 
LIMITATIONS  
 
This midterm evaluation was conducted from  December 4, 2019 to August  31, 2020. It covers  the 
period from the TBSA P’s inception in March 2016 through September 2019. The  evaluation team 
included three technical experts: Roy Natherson (Team Leader), Cheryl Goldstone (TB Expert),  and 
Lahla Ngubeni (Evaluation Spe cialist). Figure 3 outlines key milestones in the evaluation tim eline.

Study D esign  
The midterm evaluation  used a mix ed methods methodology of  primary and secondary qualitative and 
quantitative data collection and analysis. The evaluati on team selected  eight of the 14 TBSAP  
interventi on districts across  the six provinces  for key info rmant in terviews ( KIIs): four high burde n TB 
provinces , two medium burden, and two  low burden. A quasi-experimental comparison of key outcome 
indicato rs was a lso conducted using eight comparison districts  matched to the eight TBSAP districts .  
Key Data Sources 
The following sources were used to collect data to address the evaluation objectives and questions:  
 
• Key i nformant interviews. In -depth interview s were c onducted with key informants (KIs) at 
national, pr ovincial , and district levels. At the national level, US AID, ND oH, other donors and 
implement ing agencies , and partne rs were interviewed. At provincial, district, facility , and 
  
11 | Page  
 community levels, the team interviewed a range of Department of H ealth (DoH) managers and 
frontline health workers, TBSAP staff , commun ity partner organizations, and other implementing 
partners wo rking in TB. A total of 8 2 KIIs were conducted  (Table 1) . Annex I V provides  a 
complete l ist of the KIIs. 
• TB data sources. TBSAP project data and D istrict  Health Information System (DHIS) district 
data were used to respond to the evaluation objectives and questions.  
• Key documents. A comprehensive litera ture review was conducted. Annex I V lists the 
documents reviewed, including:  
o TBSAP documents: Or iginal USAID req uest for proposal, the TBSAP contract, a nd 
its modifications;  TBSAP  quarterly reports , annual repo rts, and annual workplans ; 
Performance Moni toring Plan ( PMP) and monitoring and evaluation ( M&E) plans; and 
other TBSAP presentations, reports , and materials.  
o Global and South African guidance document s: The desk review included South 
Africa’s National St rategi c Plan for HIV, TB, STIs (2012 ‒2016 a nd 2017‒2022), National 
TB Strategic Plan (2012 ‒2016 and 2017 ‒2022), and the ND oH Joint TB, HIV, PMTCT , 
STI and Hepatitis Program Review, 2019. Global TB guidance documents from WHO, 
STOP TB , and E nd TB, and other relevant journal articles and reports from  partners 
worki ng in TB in South Africa were included  in the desk review .

 Data Analysis  
The evaluation team applied a mixed methods approach to collect qualitative and quantitative data on 
the four evaluation questions. A comparativ e analysis of the performance of TBSAP di stricts  and 
epidemiol ogically similar non -intervention districts was carried out to triangulate the findings and build 
convergence. Additional information on the evaluation methods, data collection instruments, an d 
sources  of information is provided in Annexes  II, III, and IV . 
Constraints and Limitations  
Implementation of the evaluation experien ced tw o key  constraints. First , in March  2020, the G OSA 
enacted a national lockdown in response to the coronavirus disea se (COVID- 19) pandemic , which 
prevented the evaluation team from planned travel to districts and facilities for qualitative interviews a nd 
data collection . This constraint required the team to conduct interviews remotely . Moreover, data could 
not be collec ted directly  from facilities . This constraint  limited the overall analysis to the district level 
only.  
 
Second, TB datasets were avail able at the district le vel only, and through 2017 only, limiting  the resulti ng 
quantitative analysis  of comparative data. The evaluation  team therefore conduct ed a comparative 
analysis of results from eight TBSAP districts with eight comparison  districts  through the  first year of 
TBSAP implementation  only, not through the three- year period  of implemen tation as initially plann ed. 
Secondary data from the TBSAP and q ualitativ e data  from KIIs provi ded further insigh ts on successes 
and limitations at the facility and community  levels. Constraints and  limitations  are further detailed in 
Annex II.  
Ethical Considerations  
Verbal consent was  obtained from KIs, per USAID guidelines. All interview data were kept c onfidenti al 
and were used for evalu ation purposes o nly.

 FINDINGS , CONCLUSIONS  AND 
RECOMMENDATIONS  
Question I: To what extent has TBS AP been effective and successful in 
achieving its  state d obj ectives and  targets?  
The TBSA P’s overall goal is to contribute to the red uction of the burden of  TB through the achiev ement 
of its four outcome indicators  and other key indicators across the TB cascade (TB  screening, testing, 
and treatment compl etion,  among others) . 
The evaluation sought to assess the TBSAP’s effectiveness b y: (1) comparing the p roject’s results with  its 
annual targets across the TB cascade of care, including its four outcome  indicators; (2) comparing the 
TBSAP ’s results in eight selected intervention  districts with results in eight compar ison districts acros s 
the TB cascade of ca re, including the project’s  four outcome  indicators; and ( 3) assessing  the project’s  
alignment  with key national and donor strategies as benchmarks of best pra ctice guidance.  
TBSAP Performance (TBSAP re sults compared with  annual targe ts) 
The TBSAP’s per formanc e was assessed against it s four outcome indicators  and other indicator s across 
the TB cascade. Re sults against the four outcome indicators are  presented in Table 2.

The TBSAP achieved its  fiscal year (FY)19  targets for one of the four outcome in dicators:  DR-TB 
treatment initiation. The project was within three percentage points of achieving its FY 19 tar get for DR -
TB treatment success, and approximately 10 percentag e points lower than its targets for both DS -TB 
treatment suc cess and ART c overage f or TB/HIV coinfected clients . The TBSAP performed well in TB 
screening and t esting, with variable pe rformance  in rates of clients lost to follow -up (LTFU) (and rat es 
steadil y increasing among DS -TB clients) . These latter results ar e summarized and explained in Table 3 .

Targets were initia lly set at the baseline for the project in 2016 but were subsequently updated to take 
into account the 90/90/90 methodolo gy employed  in the Stop TB Strategy . Midway through the project, 
the  TBSAP was on track to achieve 5 of its 10 key indicators.  
Drug-susceptible  TB 
The TBSAP  districts performed  well in DS -TB screening, testing, and initiat ion betw een FY1 7 and FY19, 
but underperformed in tr eatmen t success and LTFU . The TBSAP’s  districts TB screening  rate increased 
from a baseline of 68.7 percent in 2016 to  86 percent in FY19, surpass ing the target o f 81.48 percent for 
FY19 . The testi ng rat e also inc reased year by year, surpassi ng its  FY19 target of 87.68 percent  and 
benefitting from  enhanced diagnostic services, inc luding the expansion of GeneXpert, which f acilitates 
faster detection of  both DS - and DR-TB. The treatment initiation r ate was maint ained  at above the 90  
percent target fro m baseline to FY19,  with a DS-TB treatment initiation r ate of 97 percent in FY19.  
The TBSAP  district s’ treatment success rate for DS -TB varied , declining from 8 2.6 percent in FY17 to 
75 percent in FY18 an d rising slightly to 77 percent in FY19. Increasing DS -TB LT FU contributed to this 
performance, increasing  from 6 percent in FY17 to 9.4 percent in FY18 to 11.2 percent in FY19. TBSA P 
cited adherence challenges  and deaths as contributi ng factors . The DS-TB treatment success r ate was 
also affected by data entry and data quality issues . In 2017, the TB module was transitioned between 
two of  South Africa’s health information systems , from ETR.n et to TIER.Net, with asso ciated data and 
system errors . This change resulted in a si milar do wnward trend in the national TB dat a during this 
period. Moreover , the TBSAP noted a tendency to prioritize HIV program data for entry in TIER.Net,  
15 | Page  
 with data en try backlogs at multiple facilities. The project is implementing  data clean -up and other 
measures across its districts to miti gate these  challenges.  
Drug-resistant TB  
The TBSAP di stricts performed well in DR- TB initiation and LTFU  between FY17 and FY19 , but 
underperformed  in treatment success. T he DR-TB treatment initiation rate surpassed the FY19 target, 
at 82 percent, with progressive imp rovement  year-by-year from FY17 to FY19 . Of note, TBSAP 
reported that 74 percent of South Africa’s DR -TB patien ts enrolled on  new drugs and regimens were 
from supported  districts . The TBSAP met its target for DR -TB treatment success only in F Y18, althou gh 
FY19  performance of  64 percent against t he 66.48 percent target was c lose. TBSAP’s FY18 and FY19 
results, which  were notably higher t han baseline and FY17 pe rformanc e, were facilitated by the 
introduction of short- course bedaquilin e therapy. The TBSAP m et its FY18 and FY19 targets for DR -TB 
LTFU , with 13 percent LTFU in FY1 9 compared with a  target of 16.52 percent. DR-TB reporting was 
not integrated in the TB module in TIER.Net ; ther efore,  performance reporting was not af fected by the 
same dat a quality issue s as were DS-TB data , as discussed above. 
The project supported  the decentralization of DR -TB management in al l 14 districts an d 63 sub -districts, 
in line w ith GOSA policy of “ one functional decentralized DR -TB site per  sub-district.” As a r esult, 
patients receiving the short course regimen for  DR-TB showed  a marked reduction in the initial LTFU 
rates (including a  50% reduction i n the death ra te). Moreover , the proportion of X DR-T B patients 
initiated on treatment increased fr om 65 percent in FY17 to 98 percent in FY19.  
TB/HIV Coinfection  
TBSAP districts underperformed in terms of the proportion of TB clients w ho were teste d for HI V and 
the percentage of TB/HIV coinfected  clients on ART . It did not meet the annual targets for either 
indicator  from FY17 to FY19.  TBSAP performance in the proportion  of TB clients who were tested for 
HIV declined year  by year, from  94.4 percent in FY17 to 82.9 percent in FY18 to  71 percent i n FY19. 
The TBSAP achi eved 85 percent ART coverage compared with a 96 percent target in FY19. The project 
cited differences in da ta reporting protocols in the Western Cape provinc e (West Coast, C ity of Cape 
Town , and Cape Winelands districts) , which r eported  ART initiations with  TB outcomes and not with 
case findin g. This was a contributin g factor in the  underperformance of  ART init iation among TB clie nts 
in these districts .  
Comparati ve Analysis of TB SAP Interv ention  Districts and non-TBSAP District s  
The second approach used to determine the effectiveness of the TBSAP w as comparing project results 
with results achieved in non -TBSAP  districts  based o n 2014‒ 2017/2018 DHIS data. To do this,  eight 
districts (four high TB burden, two medium  burden, and two low  burden) were selected to match the 
eight intervention TBSAP districts. The districts  were paired on the ba sis of TB inci dence (number of 
new district TB no tifications) . The evaluation team  analyzed  15 indica tors, comparing  the performance 
of the intervention  and comparison  districts. This district -level analysis is available in Annex II .  
An overall  analysis of the eigh t TBSAP districts compared with  the eight comparison districts  across the 
four outcome indicators  reveals that the TBSAP performed slightly better in DR- TB treat ment success 
and sligh tly worse in ART i nitiation f or TB/HIV co infected clients, with equivalen t performance in DR -
TB initiation and D S-TB treatment success  (Figure 4).

 “But the challenge in the di strict, it was 
death, our death rat e for both TB and 
MDR  are really gi ving us a challenge. 
TBSAP is helping us with our audits 
every time there is a death and we are very happy now as the numbers  are 
coming down.” 
– District TB coordinator   
The district -level analysis yielded more nuanced performance 
differences in indicato rs across the cascade . For example,  TBSA P 
districts had lo wer treatment failure rates th an their comparison 
districts  by 10 to 20 percent. TBSAP districts outperformed  their 
comp arison districts  for the TB d eath rate (2016 cohort). For this 
indicator, t he best performers were the TBSAP districts of 
eThekwini, City of Johannesburg , and West Co ast, with death ra tes 
lower than their comparison districts  by as much as 40 to 50 
percent, evidence th at the TBSAP interventions were yielding  
positi ve results.  
This finding  was confir med by the qualitative interviews . Respondents from the TBSAP and the Do H 
working in  Sekhukhune and uMkhanyakude districts referred to t he decl ine in TB deaths in their 
respective districts.  
Further evidence of progress made is  the DR -TB treatment failure rate: five of the eight TBSAP districts 
out-performed  their compar ison dist ricts. Performance for TB/HIV is  not as clear cut; the compar ison 
districts  were on  par (equivalent in performance) with the TBSAP  districts. TBSAP districts were only 
better at screening HIV patients for TB and for initiating them on ART by a sma ll margin (~ 5 %). This 
speaks to the efficacy of their sc reening programs and  the attention paid to finding and treating 
vulnerable populations , such as people living with HIV .  
Several  unforeseen challenges and limitations in this exercise severel y constra ined t he evaluation team’s 
ability to draw any substantive conclusions from th e comparative analysis . DHIS data were available 
through 2017 only (and for a handful of data points  in 2018) ; as such, the comparison assesses the init ial 
year of TBSAP implemen tation only. It is therefore premature to expect outcome- level performance 
differences . In addition, the TBSAP was assigned some of the highest burden districts, with the highest 
caseloads and the most challenging contextual factors. Thi s includes  the major me tropolitan areas of the 
City of Johannesburg, City of Tshwane, eThekwini, and Cape Town. As metros , these districts may have 
better -resourced facilities and systems, but they also have higher population density and client mo bility. 
The comparison  districts are all high burden districts, and they all had some level of partner support.

Figure 5: Materials  Produ ced in Collaboration with the NDoH  
Given the additional constraints and challenges faced by  conducting this evaluation during lockdown (in 
terms of travel  restrictions , limited access to da ta, etc.) , the comparison was based solely on the DHIS 
data for the p eriod indicated (year 1 of TBSAP implementation)  and did not control for other  factors or 
predictors of performance, such as the relative strengths of the DoH, data management systems, etc.   
TBSAP Alignmen t with Key Global, Donor, and N ational  Strategie s 
The evaluation team asses sed the TBSAP ’s alignment with key 
global, USG ( USAID and PE PFAR), and GOSA TB strategies  and 
priorities, an indicator of project implemen tation compliance with  
TB evidence- based best p ractice. The TBSAP is aligned with and 
respons ive to global and USG  guidelines and strategies , including 
the WHO End TB Strategy, U SG Global TB Strategy , and the 
White Hous e National Action Plan to Comba t Multidrug -Resistant 
TB. This evaluatio n reviewed the TBSA P’s strategies and technical 
action plans, and confirm ed that they are aligned with and 
responsive to GO SA and NDoH strategies and other officia l 
documents, such  as the National Strategic Plan f or HIV, TB and 
STIs (2012- 2016 and 2017-2022) , and TB data at national and sub -national level s.  
The NTP  has five intervention s under the Find-Treat-Prevent Framework and two cross -cuttin g 
interventions , which were used to  evaluate alignment. The  following TBSAP  interventions are the most 
pertinent contri butions to the NTP and are aligne d with its strategies , as described in the Fi nd-Treat-
Prevent Framework:  
1. Finding missing patients  
2. Key populations  
3. Urine test for the detection  of 
the lipoarabinomannan antigen  
(u-LAM) diagnostics 
implementation   
4. Enhanced case detec tion  
5. DR-TB decentralization : one 
functional decentralized DR -TB 
site per  sub-district 
 
The T BSAP piloted interventions 
demon strated to be succ essful in other co untries, testing them in the South African contex t to confirm 
their feasibility and effectiven ess. The  interventions  that show  great promis e if taken to scale in  the 
country  have been extensively documented by the TBSAP . They are being i ntegrate d in national policy 
to institutionalize their prac tice and accredited for nationally recogniz ed health worker training  (Figure 
5). The most effective TBSAP interventions  are discussed  in Question 2. 
Summary  
The TBSAP  achieved its FY19 target f or one of its four outcome indicators (DR -TB treatment initiation) . 
The projec t was close to  achieving its DR -TB treatment success target, but wa s sign ificantly behind in its 
targets for DS -TB treatment success and ART cover age for TB/HIV c oinfected clients. The TBSAP 
performed well in TB screening and t esting, with varia ble perform ance in LTFU rates. The TBSAP is 
aligned with and re sponsiv e to global  and USG guidelines and strategies, a nd to GOSA strategies a nd 
policies. Several  TBSAP  interventions are curre ntly being scaled up, integrated , and inst itutionalized in  
nation al policy.

– DoH KI Question 2. What key interventions and activities have  been most 
effective/high im pact in achieving results? (Which are least or less 
effective?)  
The TBSAP has imp lemented several i nterventions and activities that have had a positive effect o n TB 
outcomes in the selected districts. Whereas t he project descrip tion lists three objectives or  
intermedia te result area s, TBSAP  was designed and is implemented using a “ whole systems” approac h, 
whereby  interconnec ted interventions are carried out in collaboration with partners to achieve syst em-
level changes through inc remental steps. T he evaluatio n team assessed the effec tiveness of TBSAP 
interventions based o n two factors: (1 ) performance  indicators that could be linked to a specific  activity ; 
and (2) the frequency with which  specific  interv entions were mentioned as pr oject successes or 
strength s during the q ualitative in terviews .  
More Effective Interventions 
Based on these c riteria, the three most effective interventions  were identified as: (1) buildin g 
partnerships for multisectoral accountability; (2) infection prev ention and control ( IPC) activities; and (3) 
continuous quality improvement (CQI) . 
Building Partnerships fo r Multisectoral Accountability  
Activitie s under this intervention include: (1) w orking with 
national, provincial, and district DoHs to harmonize activities and 
assure  the judici ous and efficient use  of resources; (2) provision of 
support to th e Departments  of Agriculture, F orestry and Fisheries , 
and to Social Development and Basic Ed ucation to identify 
opportunities to strengthen TB responses; (3) c ollaboration with 
PEPFAR District Support Partn ers (DSPs ) to improve TB case 
finding, linkage to care , and treat ment outcomes; (4) collaboration 
with private general practitioners (GPs) and  traditional health 
practitioners (THPs);  and (5) i mplementation of the non -
governmental o rganization (NGO ) network model to deliver a 
comprehensive TB  care package  to the commu nity.13 The project 
framework for  multise ctoral accountabil ity is available in Annex VI . 
 
 
13 In this re port, the term “ NGO ” serves as an umbrella for community -based organizations supported by the  TBSAP.

 “You know, th ey follow the st ructures 
very well, and the n the province will 
introdu ce them down  to the district 
level, with meeting our directors. A nd 
then f rom there, they will be intr oduced 
into the facilities. You kno w why this 
approach w as done? It’s not easy for t he 
supporters if  they just go straig ht to the 
facilities. We find peop le, they don 't 
accept a person who j ust comes to their 
facility with out – I mean, being 
introduced by the principal. But if they 
are intr oduced well, y ou find  that the ir 
relationship wit h the facilities  becomes 
very good. So,  if you go t hrough the  right 
level, you find  that your reception wil l be 
better.”

organ izations. When asked about successful interventions to 
build multisecto ral accountability, 100 percent of the TBSAP 
respo ndents (31/31) and  91 pe rcent o f NDo H respondents  
(21/23) mentioned the TBSAP’s participation in established 
DoH TB program review structures at a ll levels, such as the TB 
Think Tank at the national  level, and provincial - and district -
level donor coordination and TB program  review meeti ngs. 
This collaborativ e approac h, along  with a healthy respect for 
government protocols, have ensured buy -in and have been 
critical success factor s for the project.  
NGO ne twork mod el: KIs at district and facility levels were 
especially appre ciative of th e assist ance provi ded by TBSAP-
suppo rted NGOs: 78 percen t of all KIs (64/82) and 79 percent 
of KIs working at the sub-national  level in the D oH (15 /19) 
agreed that the organizat ions provided significant support to communities and  households .14 They 
contribute to efforts  to find missing TB patient s thro ugh improved contact management, cas e finding , 
and treatment adherence for  patients across all distric ts supported . The model uses a targeted approach 
based on the identification of TB hotspots and  high TB burd en facilities to identify the c ommunitie s that 
are most affected by TB. It then  links them with a network of c ommunity health workers (CHWs) who 
are familiar with the communit ies and  their needs. The identification of gaps and priorities in th e 
community i s done in consultation with and under  the guidance of  the D oH at the district l evel, with 
facilities referring patients likely to default from TB treatment and who may require  suppor t for 
treatment adherence to NGOs . The CHW  develop s a close  relationship w ith the  patient and offer s a 
comprehens ive patient- centered package of services that considers the patient’s level of ri sk, personal 
circumstances , and preferences. Home visits provi de an opportunity to identify the need  for social and 
financial protection  and fo r education  on TB infection con trol measures. The NGO network model has 
contributed meaningfully to TBSAP ach ievements . During FY18/19, throu gh the efforts of 49 NGO s 
funded b y TBSAP under the NGO network model , 810,454 people were r eached and screene d for TB, 
of whi ch 5,962 were diagnose d with TB (yield=0.74% ) and 5,543 (93%)  were initiated on treatment. A 
small coh ort analysis of D R-TB patien ts initiated on treatment f rom 2016‒2018 demonstrated 
significantly better treatment success rates and lower  LTFU a nd death rates among patients sup ported 
by the NGOs  compared with the standard of care, an indication of the potential of the comm unity 
model wh en implemented well.  
 
 
 
14 The notable ex ception  was the City of Johannesburg, where, at the request of Gauteng province, TBSAP FA ST activities are conf ined to 
hospita ls because 18 other organizations s upport HIV/ TB activities at primary health care (PHC) and community lev els.

– TBSAP KI Althoug h it has significantly contributed to TB outcomes in TBSAP districts , the s ucces s of the NGO 
network model  is dependent on consist ent and continuous  
funding and ongoing  support to the or ganizat ions. Inefficient 
management of the small grants p rogram has hindered the NGO s’ 
sustained contributions, which is discussed further in  Question 3 . 
Nevertheless , the GOS A will be adapting the TBSAP package of 
support d eveloped for the NGO s for sc ale-up through the W ard-
based Primary Health  Care Outreach  Team (WBPHCOT) 
program , with assist ance from the TB SAP. Scale up of  this 
program will co ntinue through the end of the TBSAP and beyond.  
Reaching key and vulnerable pop ulations: The private sector  has a 
wide reach and poten tial for participation in TB care and 
preventio n, especially in accessing har d-to-reach vulnerable 
populations. The TBSAP  piloted an effective mo del with private  
medical practitione rs, and with workpla ces (such as farms and  
small mining companies)  to offer their workers primary health 
care ( PHC) services. This model demons trated a val uable 
contribution to case finding .  
Infection Prevention and Control  Activities  
The TBSAP IPC  packag e is a comprehensive set of activities implemented at national, provincial, d istrict, 
facility, and communit y levels. The activi ties include contribut ions to nati onal IPC policies, t ools, and 
guidelines ; capacity- building and mentorship  suppo rt for TB prog ram managers and imp lementers at 
provincial and district levels ; facility a nd household risk assessments ; and district - and faci lity-level 
support for  the implemen tation of the Finding TB A ctively , Separating safely, T reating effectivel y (FAST) 
approach at selected hospitals.  Project staff carry out all  activities using a technic al assistance approach 
to capacitate district -level DoH staff to deliver  appropriate, quality TB se rvices  in an environme nt that 
complies with national infection  control  standards. All training is provided using ND oH policies, 
treatment algorithms , and gui delines. CHWs from project- funded  NGOs  (and/o r WBPHCOTs) conduct 
home -based  IPC r isk assessments using tools developed by  the project, and provide educat ion to 
improve infection control measures in hou seholds and to reduce the transmission of TB.  
Nearly 80 pe rcent of KIs (63/82) recognized FAST as a TBS AP flagship strategy. The y included 87 
percent (20/23) of DoH respondents , 87 percent ( 27/31) of TBSAP  respondents, and 5 6 percent  (15/27) 
of respondents from other support partners. Although  the approach is centere d on the fact that prompt 
diagnosis and e ffective treatment are  the mos t important activities  in the health care facility setting to 
prevent T B transmi ssion to  health workers and other susceptible patients , effective implemen tation 
spans act ivities acr oss the entire TB car e cascade .15 The NDoH end orsed FAST as part of the TBSA P’s 
support i n 2016 , and the project was instr umental in packaging existing NDoH IPC policy an d 
guidelines16 in an implementabl e program using the FAST app roach. The pro ject’s activi ties include 
orientation and training of health workers at various levels ; the development of an im plementation guide 
outlining  basic informatio n on the resources, pro cesses , and procedures needed for the successful 
implementation of FAST ; and a checklist to monitor complian ce with  IPC measures. The FAST approach 
 
 
15 This includes  early detection through active case finding, diagnosis, and fol low-up of confirmatory laboratory results  to prompt initiation on 
treatment.  
16 These i nclude the National Polic y and Strategy for Infection Prevention and Control (2007) and National Infection Pre vention and Control 
Guidelines for TB, MDR -TB and XDR -TB (2 015).

 “…So I would say our greatest succe ss 
has been the intro ductio n and the 
implementation of FAST within the 
district. Which on  its own, it's crea ted 
awarene ss, TB awar eness within the staff, 
because even when it comes to infecti on 
prevent ion and contr ol prac tices, they 
got to improve quite a lot…”  
– TBSAP  KI was first implem ented in April 2017, with facilities added in a phased rollou t, and the strate gy has shown 
such good results that it has been adopted by hospitals outside the TBSAP -support ed districts. As of 
September 20 19, implementation of FAST had been scaled up to 142 h ealth facilities in five provinces: 
Eastern Cape, Gauteng, Free Sta te, KwaZulu -Natal, and Limp opo. 
Results from  TBSAP -suppo rted hospitals impl ementing FAST from 2 017 to 2019 show  a 33 percent 
increase in the in-hospital rate of screening for TB , from 131,112 patients screened in 2017 to 1,994,604 
patients screened in 2019  (Table 4). The number of patients diagnosed with TB inc reased from 880 ( 839 
DS-TB and 41 DR-TB) in 2017 to 5,8 40 (5,600 D S-TB and 240 DR-TB) in 2019, although the percentage 
of presumptive T B patients remained  at 3 to 4 perce nt in 2018 
and 2019, and the TB positivity rate remained stable at 13  to 14 
percent.  With this  growth  in case load, the DS- TB LTFU rate  
increased from one percent in 2017 to five percent in 2019, and 
from two percent in 2017 to five percent in 2019 for DR -TB.  
A review of  district -level TBSAP hospital data for FAST shows 
interesting variati ons. For  example, i n the City of Johannesburg,  
FAST  was scaled up from two district hospita ls (South Rand and 
Bheki Mla ngeni Hospitals) in  2017/18 to one regional facility, 
one specialis t mother and child hospital, and three 
tertiary/ac ademic hospitals (Ch ris Hani Baragwanat h, Helen Joseph , and Charlotte M axeke academ ic 
hospitals) i n 2019/20. Although  screening rates were s imilar to the na tional FAST hospit al average  in the  
City of Johann esburg , and testing rates were slightly higher (66% ‒83%), the TB positivity rate increased 
increme ntally from 15  percent in 2017/18 to 20 percent in 2018/19 to 32 percent in 2019/ 20. 
 
Facilities were added in a phased rollout of FAST (7 hospitals  in year 1 [ 2017] , 40 in year 2 , and 72 in 
year 3) . Table  4 presents the overall results across the ca re cascade for all hospitals  at which the  TBSAP 
provided direct support during 2017 t o 2019.

 “FAST re duces the issues of cross -
infection  in health  care workers in 
facilities. And  also, FAST reduce s time 
gaps between diagnosis and initiation; at 
the very same time, it reduces infection 
from one perso n to a nother or from one 
perso n to a nurse in that w ay. So, FAST 
is not only for pati ents but also for health  
care worker s.”  
– TBSAP  KI These finding s indicate  that despite improved access to PHC  service s, many TB cases in South Afric a are 
still diagno sed at hospitals .17 The TBSAP  established s creening stations in every hospita l area a nd ward 
to institu tionalize the p ractice of universal TB screening, 
which facilitates more effective testing and increased yield—
an overall better use of limited resources . The TBSAP  also 
sought to increase initiation  and to mitigate LTFU by starti ng 
patient s on treatment b efore being discharged from the 
hospital  and being referred to PHC level for management.  
Nearly  30 percent of KI s (23/8 2) were of the opinion  that 
the in trodu ction of the u-LAM test as part of the TBSAP’s 
FAST strateg y to aid  the prompt d iagnosis of TB in se lected 
patients has contributed to improv ed TB diag nosis in 
patients with dissem inated TB, those coinfected with HIV 
who have  a low CD4 count , and thos e unable to produce sputum. Using u -LAM, TB was detected in 38  
percent of patients (9 25 of 2,460 patients tested). The ND oH is in the process of develo ping guidelines 
to expand the use of  u-LAM from a doctor -driven test used at  hospitals to include its use at selected 
high TB burden  PHC facilities.  
TB infection among  health workers has be come a standard it em reported in mon thly facility IPC 
reports , which  highlight them as a TB risk gr oup.18 Fifty percent of KIs  (41/82) , including  53 percent 
(10/19) of implem entation -level D oH staff , perceived FAST and its emphasis on a dministrati ve control  
measures for IPC as providing protection for health workers.   
Continuous Quality Improvement 
The TBSAP supports the implementation  of the national  TB quality improvement (TBQI) approach by  
strengthening DoH management and service delivery capacity at severa l levels throu gh the following 
activities: (1) support  the national rollout of the TBQI approach through the secondment of a nati onal 
TBQI advisor , representation  on the nati onal TBQI S teering Committee, and member ship in  the TB 
Think Tank ; (2) provi sion of leadership training and technica l assistance to provincial and district 
managers  on CQI; (3) b uild the capacity of program implementers i n DS-TB and DR- TB management, 
FAST, IPC , and quality assurance/qual ity improvement ( QA/Q I) using a combination of d idacti c training, 
coaching, and ment oring;  (4) support  the development of clinical and  management training modules, 
tools, and standard oper ating proced ures (SOPs ) to guide baseline assessm ents, and ongoing m onitoring 
and superv ision of  QI initiatives; (5)  support the introd uction of new TB treatm ent regime ns, including 
pharmacovigilance to  monitor serious adverse events; (6) s upport  the introduction of  new TB diagnostic 
techniques  (such as  u-LAM); and ( 7) support the decentr alizatio n of DR -TB services.  
Develo pment of a stru ctured process for establishing  CQI teams . Under the umbrella of a f ormal CQI 
program, TBSAP programming at all l evels focuses on planning and coordination. A clearly docu mented 
step-by-step process guide begins wi th the establishment of  buy-in from HIV/AI DS, STI and TB (HA ST) 
leadershi p/management structures at provincial  and district levels, followed by structured learn ing 
sessions addressing specific topics , and then ons ite mentoring suppo rt. Several examples of the success 
of this appr oach in extending t he implementation  of QI  beyond  the 14 TBSAP implementation districts 
were cited  by 31 percent of TBSAP implementation -level respondents (5/16 TBSAP provincial - and 
 
 
17 Clients continue to pr esent at health  facilities when they are very si ck and need advanced car e, partly due  to stigma . 
18 For example, a sub -district in Limpopo reported infections in two health professionals and a general worker in 2019.   
23 | Page  
 district -level respondents).  For example,  strong  buy-in from the Member o f the Ex ecutive Co uncil for 
Health i n Limp opo province was mentioned , which has ensure d that the CQI approach has also been 
applied in all dist ricts (inclu ding Capricorn, Vhembe , and Mopani , and at all 37 hos pitals in the province ). 
Another example is the Provinci al Departm ent of Health  (PDoH) in Gauten g requesting the  TBSAP to 
conduct workshops for managers from all five districts (i ncluding Eku rhuleni, Sed ibeng, and West Rand).  
Cluster lea rning approach.  Facilities are clustered b y sub-district and are supported to conduct baseline 
assessme nts. Structured workshop learning sessions then assist clinical and program staff to deal with 
bottlenecks and issues a long the TB management cascade ( See Annex VI ) that they iden tify at their own 
facilities. This m akes l earning re levant and promotes the development of local solutions. For those who 
do not participate in the structured sessions, a  peer learning ap proach provi des indirect benefits to 
districts and facilities tha t do n ot receive direc t project support.  For e xample, af ter managers from 
Yusuf Dadoo, Leratong , and Sedibeng hospitals in Gauteng attended the training workshops, these 
facilitie s also imple mented and r eported  on FAST with “ virtual ” TBSAP support.  
Capacit y building for h ealth professionals : The TBSAP  collabora ted with provincial r egional training centers 
(RTCs) to build the capacity of health care workers to implement and use the self -directe d learning 
modules  to strengthen management of the TB program  and casca de the knowledge and skills to fac ility 
staff. The intervention targets high TB burden fac ilities with sub -optimal performance, identifies 
bottlenecks in service delivery , and facilitat es the development of QI plans for improved TB 
management. In FY1 8/19, a total of 3,527  health workers  at different levels of the health system, 
including progra m managers and coordinators , attended various training  courses  and other capacity -
building sess ions. TBSAP also supervised 30 QI clusters in its supported  districts. Among  the nurs e 
respondents in dis trict-level management roles, 54 percent (6/11) confirmed that without training from 
the TBSAP , the TB program would not have taken off. A nurse managing  the TB program at a  Free State 
hospital , who was deployed to the f acility without  any TB knowled ge, stated h ow crucial this capac ity 
building was : “…I was  thrown in the deep end and was trained and mentored from the beginning by the 
TBSAP st aff…….on TB ca se manage ment, comput ers, data management, quality control .” This nurse 
started  the h ospital’s FAST pro gram, working closely with  the facility’s medical doctors to acquire their  
buy-in and support, and improved TB case man agement.  
Based on the suc cess of the train-the-trainer approach, TBSAP’s  capacity buildin g targets h ave increased  
by over 50  percent for FY20 to ensure increased QI coverage and impact.  The TBSAP learning modul es, 
which are accredited by the South African  Medical Association , have been recorded in the databases of 
USAID’s TraiNet,  the RTCs’ SkillMART, an d the Western  Cape ’s Professional Development Course 
training database.  
Institutionalizing the QI methodology : TBSAP is supporting the drive to institutio nalize the QI methodology 
in the N TP, second ing a QI Advisor at the national level , and two QI adviso rs at the district  level 
(Nelson Man dela B ay and West Coast)  in FY19. TBSAP has enabled provinces to commit to  tracking key 
indicators along the TB care ca scade  to monitor progress.  The project developed a QI SOP and is  
contributing  to the national QI chan ge package to sh are lessons learned , which  can be  implemented and 
scaled up nationally. 
Although the imperative to measure, assure, and improve the quality  of TB services is now well 
recognized, s ystematic attempts to integrate QI i n TB service delivery an d in TB programs re quire 
additional resou rces to  scale up and to sustain the current momentum in the districts . The TBSAP does 
not have additional resources in its distr icts for this p urpose.   
Less Effective Interventions 
The less effective interventions we re: (1) informat ion system managem ent; (2) advocacy, 
communications, and s ocial mobilizatio n (ACSM); and (3)  the ConnecTB app.

 “We do suppor t the districts in terms of 
data management, we conduct data 
verificatio ns, we condu ct data c lean ups,

– TBSAP  KI 
“We have shortage of data capturers, yes. And al so, mostly t hey a re more 
focused with t he HIV progr am than [the ] 
TB pro gram.” 
– PDoH  professional nurse  Information System Managem ent 
The TBSAP sought to strengthen  TB program d ata management (includi ng recording and reporting ) by 
supporting the tra nsition of TB data  from South Africa’s health information  system for TB ( ETR.net) to 
the countr y’s TB/HIV system  (TIER.Net) as par t of national integration efforts , and training staff  to 
facilitate its im plementation. However, pro gress wa s hindered by syst em errors a nd inadequa te 
processes and human r esources at the facility level . In an interv iew, a n above -national donor d escribed 
the TB data management  system at the NDoH as a “ crisis.” The donor cited the followin g example : 
recen tly the NT P had to ask the WHO for a n extension on  reporting  relevant 2019/2020 TB statistics 
because the NTP was unable to produce verifiable and accurate d ata on time.  
The TB SAP worked to support the TB/HIV information systems integratio n process, which was ini tiated 
in 2015 and  began in e arnest in 2017. This involved tra nsitioning the TB module (DS -TB patient data) 
from ETR.net to TIER.Net.19 The project facilitated the expansion of the TB module in TIER. Net to 
1,031 of  the 1,063 facilities in the five p rovinces  that are implemen ting TIER. Net (97% coverage).20 The 
TBSAP  also trained 1,398 health workers ( surpassing its target of 1,367) to ensur e the smooth 
implementation of the new system. However, the transition from ETR.net to TIER.Net caused data and 
system err ors, negatively a ffecting th e quali ty and accuracy of TB data .  
 
Despite the TBSAP ’s capacity- building effo rts, respondents 
reported  problems translating knowledge gain ed to 
implementation. TBSAP and D oH KIs reported  that facilitie s 
are often short staff ed and that data capturers are deplo yed 
to perfor m other administrative tasks or to capture data for 
other programs.  
In some cases , the TBSAP contracted add itional staff 
resources on a temporary basis as a s top-gap measure ; for 
example, the temporary appo intment of d ata clerks to assist 
with administrative tasks , TB patient record fi ling, and 
capturing data backlogs . Such efforts provided temporary 
relief and assisted with locating  TB patients  LTFU, for 
examp le. However, the effects have been  short -lived, 
because once th e additional manpower  is withdrawn at the 
end of the data capturers’ contracts, the filing situation and  
the management o f data back logs have recurred.  
Advocacy, Communications,  an d Social Mob ilization    
ACSM was a contractual part of  the TBSAP to promote public awareness of the TB  epidemic and its 
impact on nat ional produ ctivity and individual lives . The activity was  allocated nearly  $2.5 million.21 It 
 
 
19 Based on a WHO  recommendation on systems integration and an independent assessment of sy stems in u se, the NDoH  decided that in -
facility TB data collection, using the TB module in TI ER.Net , should be implem ented in addition to the existing ART functionality. TIER.Net 
maintains a unique rec ord for the patient at the facility level, an d record s patient da ta long itudinally. As such, all HIV, ART, and DS -TB data for 
the patient will be st ored t ogether, and repor ts can be drawn and actions can be taken  to facilitate i mproved patient management.  Sourc e:

– TBSAP  KI involved the production of IPC and i nforma tion, education , and communicati on (IEC) materials ($1.8 
millio n), and the provision  of targeted TB messa ges via media platforms ($661,00 0).22 For the first two 
years of implementation , TBSAP inve sted heavily in mass  media campaigns on national radio, telev ision, 
and billboards, and incl uded one indica tor for “Number of p eople reached ” for these activities. 
However,  the project did not include any outcome measures for these efforts  and th e considerable 
funds invested in them, notably in the costly mass media  (TV, radio billboards) and social media 
platforms. In FY19, TBSAP  developed and im plemented  a more targeted , distr ict- and co mmunity -level 
strategy  as a more cost-e ffective approach. Without the standard measures of  reach, coverage, 
penetration and recall  for ACSM activities, it  is impossibl e to assess o r analyze whethe r this significant  
investment in ACSM from th e project’ s resources had any ef fect, and more importantly, re ached key 
populations with the right messages .  
In FY 19, TBSAP integrated ACSM in  its NGO network m odel, with the identif ication of  TB hotsp ots and 
the u se of the CHWs  from its sub-grantees  to conduct  advocacy and communication  activities  in the 
communities. ACSM funding was  then mos tly devoted to the production of  IPC and IEC materials ( 73% 
of the budget spen t). TBSAP also scaled up its investment in AC SM training  for districts, their 
coordinators , and local organizations , which is  in line with the project’ s mandate  to build capacity  at 
provincial, district , and local levels. A TBSAP seni or executive explained the decision to tra nsition the 
project’s  approach, stat ing, “ACSM was d eemed too expensive and unnecessary in the context of the 
total program and its funding [was] diverted to pay for trainin g material s.”  
The project’s course correction to a more targeted approach paid better dividends i n terms  of TB 
program re sults: in FY19, 324 communi ty campai gns screened a to tal of 121, 500 peopl e for TB, with 
1,850 referred for testing and 376 new TB cases diagnosed and initiated on  treatment.  TBSAP training of 
provincial and district DoH s taff resulted in t he development of  12 district-level ACSM imp lementation 
plans, which f ocus on add ressing specific TB program challenges, such as low screening rates among men 
and high rates o f LTFU. Nonetheless, this correction was done over halfway into  implementation, a nd 
the decision  made primarily based on budg et constraints rather than  the strateg ic value of its 
investments . Given the importance of AC SM activities for 
successful  TB pro grams, this represents a missed opportunity 
to better target AC SM efforts and invest f unds more 
effecti vely. 
Connec TB A pp  
The Conn ecTB App  is an online pl atform  and mobile 
application developed by URC under  TB CARE II South  
Africa, the predecessor project to the TBSAP. ConnecT B is 
intended to s upport the pro vision of tr eatment adh erence 
support by  CHWs . App functions  include  geo-location of 
patient adherence visits, the a bility to record p atient 
information to en sure treatment validation, p rompting for 
side effects  and contact management, and r eal-time 
monitoring  and r eporting . 
The ConnecTB application  showed promise during its  pilot phase , especia lly as a tool to improve 
adherence among DR -TB patients, with reported ad herenc e rates of more than 95 percent and a LTFU

 rate of one p ercent.23 In 2018, the application was scaled up to all proj ect-supported NGOs . The 
ConnecTB platform was also  piloted among the WBPHCOTs , and the household visit tools aligned to 
include TB indicators .  
However, in late 2019, the TBSAP reported that during scale-up, the project encountered  techn ical 
problems with the impleme ntation of the ConnecTB  application  that compromised the integrity  of the 
data and implementation was halted . An inte rnal review recommended a change of servi ce provider, and 
the new pl atform  is undergo ing testing and review. This was confirm ed by 58 perc ent (1 8/31) of  TBSAP 
respondents . 
Summary  
The TBSAP ’s efforts to build partnerships for multi sectoral accountability Building Partnerships for 
Multisectoral Accountability  with va rious se ctors and across  several  levels generated c ritical goodwill 
needed  for implementation of the project. This f oundat ion has enabled the project t o support its  
districts to work towa rds the objectives and targets set by USAID and the NTP. This has been l argely 
achieved through a whole systems  appro ach aimed a t promoting CQI, efficient TB screening using the

has considerably improved t he TBSAP ’s effectivene ss in finding  missing cases an d linking them to care, 
despite the funding interruption challenges  (discussed in Qu estion 3 ). Less effective interventions a re

informat ion system is a n issue  largely outside TBSAP control ( and discusse d further in Questi on 3), the 
project identified issues with the remaining two interventions and either adjusted its str ategy (ACSM) or 
halted imp lementation for an assessment to determine futu re direction (ConnecTB application).

 “The contract must allow for flexib ility.

– NDoH  KI Question 3. What challenges and con straints  does the proj ect face and 
what co urse c orrections might improve this ? 
The TBSAP  encountered challenges and constraints that have hindered implementation and slowed  the 
progress that the project could  have made. S ome challeng es are systemic issues experienced at various 
levels of the health syst em in implementing the NTP.  As such, t hey are impediments to achieving success 
in the nation’s TB response and lie outside the contr ol of the TBSAP. Other  constraints  relate 
exclusively to the TBSAP , its implementation , and the prog ress it will likel y show  by the end of its 
contract.  
TBSAP  Design  and Implementation Challenges and C onstraints  
The technical assistance model employed by  the TBSAP has been well received by all d istricts  
supported. However , challenges re lated to project design and manage ment have inhibited the project 
and may have  unintentionally prevented it from reaching scale and delivering fully on its targets. The 
challenge s became constraints over the cou rse of the p rojec t. They include: ( 1) TBSAP c ontract an d 
management; (2) sub -grantee management; and (3) human resource a llocation during project planning.  
TBSAP Contract and Management  
Funding mechanism:  The TBSAP fu nction s under a contract 
between URC an d USAID. Con tracts imply highe r expectations  
on the part of  the donor for the implem enting partner  and are 
less flexible than  other mechanisms, such as cooperative 
agreements or grants . This  may contribute to uninten ded 
consequences ; for example, because  the TBSAP ’s contract set a 
limit on  the level of effort (LoE)  or number of pers on-days that 
the project can use, URC  project planning specified t he number 
of personnel  to be placed  in the supported  districts , which was 
later determined to be inadequate to provide t he neces sary level of mentor ship. 
Performance framework: Althoug h the TBSAP has an ext ensive PMP, the focus on results achieved toward 
the four very top -level outcome indicators versus performance against other project indicator s across 
the TB ca scade  is not well balanced . A larger  indicator  set would  enabl e implementi ng or ganizat ions to 
account for the full spectrum of their  activities, such as multisectoral  collabora tion with other partners 
working in the same districts and perfor ming similar fu nctions. Th e latter consideration is  important to 
avoid duplication of effort a nd for reasons of economy.  
Leadership and mana gement changes : The TBSAP experienced h igh turnov er of key staff, including three 
Chief s of Party, with other high -level positions  unfilled for long  periods of time. Th ere were also p roject 
manageme nt iss ues related to high-level decision -making, such as hiring by the “home office ” and not by 
the local e xecutive team.  The project also experienced frequent managem ent transitions at USAID, with 
three Contract Officer’s Representatives since incep tion. Stronger, more consistent management of the 
contract and project by b oth USAID and TBSA P might have led to  the earlier identification of issues and 
course correction s; for example, shifting  the ACSM b udget to more cost- effective activities  earlier , or 
working with the  project to adjust the district L oE allocation to better suit  the project’s needs.

 “TBSAP is also bring new ideas. They 
provide hands -on support. The us e of 
“smaller N GOs” which are largely 
community- based  may be a noble 
concept but will req uire that the NGOs 
are provided with the critical technical, 
financial and other support to ensure 
they remain viable and are then able to 
deliver th e serv ices.”  
– NDoH KI 
“And I thi nk TBSA P is more technical, 
they are  not most ly on the ground. They 
would give us t rainings,  which is good, 
but the mentoring side of it, you can be mentore d for the first week and what 
happens for the remaining period of the  
year? So, I think i f they coul d be mo re 
hands on. Secondly the per son who i s 
mentoring us, there is  only one pers on 
for the whole district. We c an on ly see 
her once  in two months because  we 
have got a lot of facilities around here in [district  name]. So, the first thing that 
can be done, appo inting of other people 
to ass ist.”  
– Facility professional nu rse 
“I woul d very much wa nt a TBSAP  
coordi nator  in every sub -district. We 
could then tr iple the successes we are 
having, particularly with DR -TB in 
vulne rable populatio ns.” 
– PDoH KI Sub-grantee Management  
The primary goal of the TBSAP’s  NGO network model is to provide TB servic es to people at  the 
community l evel. The project also acts as a capac ity-building  mechanism for local organizations , helping 
them build their technic al, financial, and ma nagement systems for long -term sustain ability. However, 
there were challen ges bringing  this inter vention to scale and  securing continuous  funding for  the NGOs. 
One-year grant s, lengthy granting proc esses, and inadequate grant administration resulted in del ays in 
grant periods and a halt in critical  relationships, community -level work, and gains mad e at the 
community level in scree ning, testing, a nd pat ient tracin g (addr essing and mitigating  LTFU ). This situation 
may have been exacerba ted by the leadership and management changes at both USAID an d TBS AP.  
All DoH provincial managers  (6/6) and TBSAP coordi nators 
(16/16) raised this as a major disrup tive issue in  the TBSAP 
districts in which the NGO networ k model was deployed. For 
example, the T BSAP reported that DR- TB patient treatment 
outcomes were noticeably  better among  those supported by 
NGO s in the Eas tern Cap e. Treatment  outcomes for facilities  
suppor ted by  one of these or ganizations  in FY17 i ncluded a 90 
percent treatment success rate among  supported pati ents 
(compar ed with  53% among  unsupported patien ts), five percent 
LTFU among  supported  patients ( compared with  15% among  
unsupported patients) , and t hree p ercen t death rate (compared 
with 9% in supported patients).  
Project Planning: Human Resource Allocatio n 
LoE limitations: TBSAP  realized during implementation that its pr oject planning did not fully take certain 
factors  into ac count . In partic ular, the KI s agre ed that the project’s staff alloc ation limited their abi lity to 
reach a wider population in the di stricts. The TBSAP 
established a  large national office, involvi ng 90 p ercent  of the 
overall  project LoE, providing  each of the  14 districts with a 
single coor dinato r. The districts  were allocated only 10 
percent of the overall TBSAP contract man -days (LoE) , based 
on the assumption that “because the project was  providing 
technical assistance  only, dis trict coordinators  would onl y have 
to train facility staff”  (URC executive). In prac tice, in addi tion 
to their work with d istrict and facility staff, district 
coordinators are involved in data cleaning and managemen t, 
and trainin g local organizations  and C HWs on  community 
outreach.  
Geographical context:  In  its initial pla nning, the TBSAP  focused 
only on the number of training sessions it would have to 
conduct pe r district to implement its programs. I t did not 
consider  the d istanc es to be traveled between f acilities and the 
volume of preparatory work to be done. Sever al of the 14 
TBSAP dis tricts are rural and are characterized  by poor road 
infrastructure , with lon g travel times between facilities.  For 
exampl e, Sarah Baartman district in  the Eastern Cape is one of 
the TBSAP’s most sparsely populated districts, at just u nder 
nine people per square kilomet er. Th e district spans ov er 
58,000 square kilometers, and the d istrict’s 82 health facilities  
29 | Page  
 “…The challenge is  that we are having 
system issues; numbe r 1 is the system  
issues… th e electro nic system, either the 
DHIS or TIER, but…a lso the los t to 
follow- up both [for] ART and TB. Again,  
we are accusing  the systems because w e 
have got th e linkage officers, t hey are 
doing their job but ther e is somethin g 
that is [does] no t tally when y ou 
compar e what is being done  versus the 
data that is coming from th e system.”  
– District DoH  KI 
 
“And in one of the engagements, it came out clear that ev en the data capturers at 
facility level, they woul d prioritise their 
time only on the HIV program…. They 
would … deactivat e the TB patients… So 
when the y run th e rep orts [from  
Tier.Net ], it would only give them people 
who missed appointments for HIV, and 
those that missed appointments for TB 
would not appe ar on the list….that 
would be shared  with their tr acer 
teams,…., for them to go and trace this 
patien t…and tr y to reduce los s to follow 
up rate.”  
– District implementing p artner  
“You need to lis ten to me , what are my 
challenges? And th en I will tell you my 
challenges is 1, 2, 3, 4 and t hen I need 
your interventio n here. You cannot 
come and tell me that y ou want to 
intervene… they were supposed to 
consult me  on what ar e my needs. I 
would have told them that I need the 
communi ty caregivers ….and I know  
which areas  that are  heavily burden ed in 
this particular area, so that they can go 
and track , because I woul d be looking at 
the data at  the district level, where do 
we have a high lo ss to follow up in b oth 
TB and H IV.”  
– District  TB manager  
“…. what are y our treatme nt gaps an d 
how can we wo rk together to res olve 
them.”   
– TBSAP district coordinator  are situated up t o 175 kil ometer s apar t. This limits the number o f 
supervisory visi ts that district coordinator s can make and t he 
number of facilitie s they  can se rve. In the Western Cape, one of 
the TBSAP ’s district coordinat ors spends 26 percent of her work 
mont h driving to an d from fac ilities. The KIs in Limpopo, 
KwaZulu-Natal , Eastern  Cape , and Western Cape r aised this 
constra int as  deserving attention and r esolution.  
Health S ystem Challenges  and Constr aints  
The TBSAP also experienced several  constraints related to  South  
Africa’s health system s, outside the project’s  control , which po sed 
consid erable challenges to its su ccess. They are: (1) information 
system managem ent; (2) funding and resource constra ints; (3) 
ongoing capacity develo pment needs; and (4) geographic al and 
socioeconomic factors.  
Information System  Mana gement   
The challe nges associated  with TB in formati on systems wa s one of 
the greatest system -level bar riers. TBSAP ’s ability to collect high-
quality data to monitor the TB cascade and  use these  data as 
evidence for  implementation  was curtailed by system er rors 
related to th e transiti on of the  TB mod ule to TIER.Net,  and 
inadequate data manage ment processes and human res ources at 
the facility level .  
Although the  GOSA  recogn izes the hig h TB burden and existing  
gaps in TB  programming , and expresses the critical need for 
TBSAP assistance in this area, c onflicting priorities with HIV and 
the relative number of implementing partners,  funding levels , 
technical assistance, and key indicators result in less time and 
ability to focus on the full TB cascade  and a ssociated data 
mana gement.  Despite efforts to integrate services , 68 perc ent 
(56/82) of res pondents , including 63 percent (35/ 56) of 
respo ndents in all six provinces , reported  that HIV and TB d ata 
management has not been fully integrated in  practice, with a 
higher priority given to HIV data management (s uch as captur ing).  
Funding and Resource C onstraints  
All p rovincial and district manage rs and  district staff ( 19/19) 
agreed that  there are common barriers to delivering satisfactory 
health services , including  a lack of material  and hum an resources, 
problem s with commun ication s and information sh aring on T B 
programming, and limited guidance o n curr ent T B policy.  
A lack of health system funding was a familiar refrain among all 
provincial staff interv iewed (19/19). F or example, the i nability of 
health facilities to repair an d supply ultraviolet li ghts, sputum  
booths, and CO 2 monitors. All provin ces (6 /6) pointed  out how  
30 | Page  
 “…we realiz ed challenges around the 
implemen tation of algorithm gui delines, 
TB trainings for staff…the bi ggest 
proble ms w ere with staff members were 
not in permanent post s. Most of  the 
time, staff membe rs who were wo rking 
on the T B progr am were just 
temporary …they wo uld move the 
person a nd bri ng in some body else. So,  
there was instability for the TB 
program.”  
– District DoH KI the scarcity of staff (due to  limited funding) was creat ing enormous  setbacks for the TB program .  
In an attempt to remove t hese barriers, all respondents r epresentin g implementi ng partners (16/16) and 
all NGOs  (5/5) interviewed agreed that the TBSAP and its peers need to agree on priority areas to be 
addressed  in TB progr amming with the district health auth orities wh ere they  provide technical 
assistance . In this way, it becomes easier to address the barriers and to fit in and adap t to district 
realities.  
More recently, the pressing priority of the COVID- 19 pandemic necessitated the realloca tion of f unding, 
materials , and human  resources from the NTP. T his is addressed in Questi on 4. 
Ongoing C apacity  Devel opment Needs  
The limited number of TBSAP staff allocated at subnational levels , coupl ed wi th high D oH staff turnover 
and poorl y function ing system s (such as  those for d ata manageme nt), impede ef forts to embed 
recommended ( and policy- based)  TB management pr actices . This finding is especially the case at  the 
facility level, where an ef fectiv e dos e, frequency, duration , and coverage  of suppor t visits a re require d 
for new pr actices and interventions to be institutionalized. O f note,  district s continue to prefer  technical 
assistance because  it offers a route to up -skill their staff in a su staina ble fashion; direct ser vice delivery is 
viewed as “ taking away jobs.”  It helped the T BSAP that several of their c oordinators are ex -district 
HAST coordinators who kn ow how  to fit in.  
At the same time, a sufficient absorptive capacity of the 
recipien t orga nization is key to succ essful capacity- building. 
TBSAP r espon dents and th e district  coordinator s alike lamented 
the need to constantly train “ new” staff members —instead of  
the planned  focus on mentorship and supportiv e supervision —
because of the instabilit y of the staffing situa tion at PHC 
faciliti es. Some  provinces  (e.g., Limpopo) have a staff rota tion 
policy whereby clinical staff rotate throu gh different clinical 
service s every six mont hs, which is compounded by staff 
shortages and high staff turno ver. In some districts , such  human 
resource- related challenges are aggravated  by poor sys tems, 
weak infrastructure , and the lack of leadership.  
TBSAP staff reported on a surprising finding in some dis tricts , in which  the old injectable regimens w ere 
still used in TB care. This w as ascribed to substand ard commun ication pathways and weak intern al 
knowledge sharing (training) strategies  in the  districts. New guidelines are not optimally disseminated to 
health care workers, who might be unaware that use o f evidence to manage TB implementa tion was 
inadequat e and that changes  in TB ca re were require d. 
Geographi cal and Socioeconomic Facto rs 
Every p rovin ce and its districts presented a unique environment for TB SAP implem entation . Although  all 
project districts have a high TB burden, they compr ised both urban and rural communities . Some 
operate near min ing areas, o thers in farming communities , or in de nsely populated inner cities . As 
previously noted, many present  geographi cal challenges, cov ering vast dista nces and with poor road  
infrastru cture. The major metros  may ha ve better -resourced fac ilities and systems, but they also have 
higher populati on den sity and client mobility. These factors  complicate service delivery  and TB 
outcomes. F or example,  the provinc ial staff in the Free State and L impop o districts r aised concerns 
about the hi gh LTFU rates due to  migrant populations from neighboring countries , such as Lesotho , 
which  present difficulties with  treatment adherenc e and follow -up (client tr acking and tracing). Similarly,  
31 | Page  
 informants in Gauteng noted that t he City of Johan nesburg and Ci ty of Tshwane have  large migrant 
populations that are “hidden ” and are often unable to access TB car e. 
Course Corre ctions: Data Mana gement  
TBSAP  has less th an one year before the project ends, in March 2021. Becaus e data management  is one 
of the most si gnificant  constraints , the TBSAP has the opportunity to contribute m eanin gfully to the 
current situation  by providing direct assistance to c lear the data backlogs  and help  place the 
recordkeeping systems o n a sound fo oting. This appro ach, advoca ted b y an a bove-n ational donor  
despite ackno wledgement of the TBSA P’s tech nical assistance model, would need to be explored in 
close collaboration with  USAID and with  relevant levels of the DoH.24 See the Recommendations  
section for add itional in formation.  
Summary  
Many of the constraints experienced by the TBSAP are related to  project planning and design . For 
example, d espite previous exp erience in the provinces and districts, the allocation of LoE at the nationa l 
level versu s the district level meant that the project was  not fully able  to scale up and embed 
recommended interventions in ful l-fledged sustainable programs in  the districts and then , through the 
NTP, in the rest of the country. All six PDoHs con firm th is lack of s cale up in t heir distr icts. Health 
system constraints , such as the information management system , fundin g and resource limitation s, 
ongoing capacity development needs,  and geogr aphical and socio economic factors, also  hinder ed project  
performance. Although  the TBSAP worked to ad dress and adapt to these issues , for example,  
supporting facilities to transiti on to TIER.N et for TB data and training users , these are national -level 
factors that will likely continue to affect the success of the  NTP. Such project challenges and  
constr aints—both those related to TBSAP itself and those associated with  South  Africa ’s health 
systems —indicate that much still remains to  be done to make the stand ard practice  of TBSAP 
interventions a r eality  in the car e and treatment cascade throughout the countr y.

TB in Sou th Africa, and how has this affected the progra m? 
What has chan ged i n TB epidemiology in South Africa that has a ffected the 
progra m?  
TB Pre valence Survey and Natio nal TB Dat asets 
The results of South Africa’s latest National TB  Prevalence Study, conducted  by the ND oH with suppo rt 
from its partners, were s chedul ed for  release on World TB Day  in March 2020, but this was delayed by 
the COVID- 19 crisis.  Once  available, key findin gs from the National TB Prevalence Survey, along  with 
other relevant stud ies (such as the TB Think Tank’s “ Target ing U niversal Testing for TB ” report) will 
provide new data and a strong evidence base for insi ghts to info rm future TB p rogramming. Pending th e 
availability of more recent ( 2018‒ 19) national TB datasets, coupled with  the delays in the National TB 
Prevalen ce Survey and other key studies, the evidence base available during the timeframe of this 
evaluation was to o limited to d raw any subs tantive conc lusions about  shifts in TB ep idemiology.  
TB Program Poli cy Environme nt  
The primary changes in the TB pro gram policy environment are focused on DR-TB: (1) the  strong 
emphasis on  the decentralization of DR- TB services; (2) the introd uction of nu rse-initiated DR-TB 
treatment; and (3)  the introduction of new sho rt-course al l-oral DR-T B treatment regimens . South  
Africa began scaling up its 2011decentralization strategy to treat DR- TB in district hospitals c loser to 
patients’ homes in 2017. The strategic imple mentation of QI  measures i n the se district hospitals  resulted 
in better teamwork, patient outcomes, and staff morale, and  reduced barriers to DR- TB care provision, 
especially i n rural settings.25  
In June 20 18, South Africa became the first country to repla ce injectable drug therapy for  DR-T B with a 
short- course r egimen (nine months) of b edaquiline tablets. Initial eviden ce (mainly from South Africa) on 
treating DR -TB with bedaquiline  indica tes both improved  clinical outcomes in people living with DR- TB 
and increased safety/r educed tox icity.26 South Africa is introducing 3HP ( once-weekly isoniazid -
rifapentine for  12 weeks ) as a new TB preventative therapy in line with the WH O’s recomm endation 
for scale- up as par t of the End TB Strategy. 3 HP is a shor ter regimen,  less toxic,  and with similar efficacy 
to isoniazid preventative thera py. It is also safe in combination  with efavirenz -based ART regimens . 3HP 
will be available at  select health facilities  from July 20 20, with scale -up to 23 distri cts supported by the 
Global Fund, PEPFAR, a nd Operation  Phuthuma  in 2021.27 
The NDo H  Joint TB, HIV, PMTCT,  STI and Hepatitis  Program  Review  in 2019 identified achievements  
and good practices  for both DS-TB and DR-TB, and challe nges hindering  progress.  The NDoH issued  
updated  policy and clinical reference g uidelines in 2019,  aligned with WHO’s  consolidated guidelines  on 
DR-TB treatment,  maintaining  the focus  on DR-TB services  as a priority.

Changes in the TB En vironment: the Impact of COVID -19 
The f irst case of COVID- 19 in South Afr ica was confirmed on March  5, 2020. In the last six months, 
South Africa’s total number of confirmed  COVID-19 cases has increased significantly . By late  August 
2020, over 600,000 c ases had been confirmed.  The G OSA implemen ted one of the world’s strictest 
national  lockdown s on March  27, 2020, encompassing a vast range of restrictions  to limit transmission  
while simultaneously urgently and strategi cally preparing health system s to cop e with the potential 
COVID- 19 case load and ada pt existing service delivery.   
The NDoH’s emergency preparedness and planning beg an in February 2020 and relied heavily on the 
country’s strong TB/HIV epidemic control systems and part ners to rapidly shift, in corporat ing and 
integr ating COVID- 19 in existin g case finding, contact tracing, and case and data management system s. 
The NTP was tasked with the ov erall management and coordin ation of these efforts, given the 
similarit ies in the  two airborne, respi ratory infectio ns and the network of existing i solation wards for 
DR-TB. Although  this decision was strategical ly sound in the short- term and South A frica deserves much 
credit for its  ability to rapidly adapt its s ystems and r espond to th is pandemic, it ha s had a  signific ant and 
detrimental impact on the NTP since March 2020, from service delivery  to patient management and data 
management, with potentially severe longer -term implicatio ns for TB outcomes. Of note:  
• NTP ov ersigh t and mana gement  and its TB pro grammin g and a ctivities have been 
effectively halted d ue to competing priorities related to the COVID- 19 emergency  response.  
• The diver sion of TB resources  in response to COVID- 19 has b een considerable; for 
exampl e, TB wards  in hospitals have been converted to CO VID-19 wards, and CHWs and data 
capturers have been deployed to conduct COVID- 19 screening services , leavin g TB service s 
relativ ely understaffed.  
• Drop in TB c ase finding:  South A frica’s  National 
Health Laboratory Serv ices (NHLS)  confirmed that the 
level 5 lo ckdow n restrictions (during the period March  
27, 2020 to  April 30, 2020) resulted in an approximately  
48 percent average weekl y decline in the number of TB 
tests using GeneXper t, and that  the number of TB  
positive cas es detected  declined by 33 percent.28  
• Resulting decline s across the TB cascade:  National 
and international civil society organizations have 
cautioned  about the po tential negative impact that the 
redeployment of resources, coupled with  social 
distancing me asures, may have on the TB prog ram in 
terms of TB  case finding s, treatment adherence, and 
stigma.  
 
These findings were confirmed by respondents repre senting five 
of the six provinces.

 In South Africa, the COVID -19 p andemic is expected to result in a drop of 11,000 ne w HIV patients 
from TB entry poin ts and a 10 percent decline in the completion  of TB preventive therapy  in PEPFAR’s 
TB/HIV program in quarter 3 of FY20  (July‒September 2020) alone , a significant decrease in the 
achievement of  targets  (Figure 6).29 These unintended consequ ences are likely to have a n increasingly 
negative impact on pre vious efforts to control and reduce the TB burden, which rem ains the leading 
cause of disease death in South  Africa , killing an average of 5,000 people per mon th.30

Intervention s to Mitigate the I mpact of COVID -19 on TB in South Af rica 
To mitigate the negative impact of the COVID- 19 pandemic on TB services, WHO recommends that in 
addition to the restoration of routine services , there is a need for “ catch -up” measures to focus on 
reducing the  pool of undetected and unreported TB cases that have been increasing during the periods 
of lockdown . Such measures include intensive ACSM and TB awareness raisin g, intensified active case 
finding , and contact tracing activities. T he NTP, with support from the national TB Think T ank, is in the 
process of developing a TB Recovery Plan , which will soon be launched  in conjunction with the TB 
Prevalence Survey  mentioned above. The TB Recovery Plan encompasses:  
1. Intensified TB case findin g, including universal GeneXpert testing for peop le living with HI V at 
ART initiation sites , and TB self -screening . 
2. TB case hol ding, including scale -up of digital health technologies (ND oH mHealth tool).  
3. TB/HIV and data management,  including explorin g out- of-facility TB/HI V integration models ( e.g., 
routine TB  screening among clients in differentiated care) and instit utionalizing weekly 
verification of TB and TB/HIV data .

 “Now with the COVID -19 pan demic …in 
the hospitals,  there are tents, where 
each and every  patient or each and eve ry 
person who comes to the h ospital, they 
are screened for COVID. So, this also 
includes screening for TB, because those 
patients that are sy mptom atic, when they 
are scree ned at  the ten ts, they will fall in 
the orange zone. So those are  also you r 
TB patient s, your TB presumptives [sic ]. 
So, which then, w e really need to make

– TBSAP provincial man agers TBSAP Interv entions during the COVID -19 Crisis 
Because COVID- 19 can also cause se vere illness in 
immunoc ompromised p eople and primarily attacks the respi ratory 
system, it is imperative that health serv ices for all co -morbidities , 
and especially TB, are not compromised. Loca ting and linking 
diagnosed TB patients to quality  care is now more critical than 
ever to lower the  risk of these patients su ccumbi ng to COV ID-19. 
To ensure the continuous quality of TB management services, 
TBSAP is working  closely with the NDoH  towar d an integrated 
approach to service delivery. The p roject has also been actively 
involved in supp orting the DoH  rapid respo nse teams to  conduct  
IPC assessments at  the facility level. These assessments were 
informed by the project’s best practices and l essons learn ed from 
implementing IPC measures at  health facilities  across the country. 
Despite restri ctions in movement and the high risk o f infectio n, 
TBSAP staff ha ve been active in providing techn ical assistance to 
support both TB and COVID -19 efforts. TBS AP initiatives include :  
• Integrated COVID -19 and TB screenings in 
communities : TBSAP a nd its local organization s 
conducted c ommunity  screening c ampaign s in 
collaboration with th e DoH , which  helped to actively 
identify  COVID- 19 patie nts at the household  level.  
• Capacity building for COVID -19: Partnering  with 
PEPFAR -funde d DSPs, TBSA P suppor ted ca pacity building 
activities nationwide, including training nearly  800 health 
care workers  on integrated case finding initiatives.  
• Strengthening  IPC measures at health facilities: 
TBSAP  supported 425 facilities a cross six pr ovinces  on IPC activities , including FAST , IPC 
implementation and monitoring, and IPC ris k assessme nts. 
• Informing the public about COVID -19: TBSAP took an acti ve role in knowledge and 
information sharing about COVID -19, le veraging the opportunity to promote  TB me ssaging to 
audiences acros s a range of platfo rms, including local radio  stations  and on social media .31 
 
Summary  
Although  key data sources on TB e pidemiology in South Africa  (such as t he latest Nati onal TB 
Prevalence Survey  and 2018 and 2019 TB data sets) are pendin g public release, TB pr ogram pol icy 
changes  indicate the integration  and uptake of advances in DR -TB treatment and decen tralized serv ice 
delivery. However, the COVID- 19 pandemic has advers ely affected the NTP in terms of management, 
resource allocation (in cluding hu man resources ), and se rvice delivery, with projections  of poo rer TB 
outcomes across the  cascade.  The TBSAP has contributed  to the national COVID -19 response , such as  
screening and education efforts, and leveraged its existing IPC and capacity bu ilding measure s to 
strengthen the h ealth system at the facility level.

 Conclusions 
At a global level and in South Africa , fewer than 50 percent of people with TB are  successfully treated.32 
The biggest gap s are in diagnosis and getting  people on treatment. Although  global advances ha ve been 
made, progress has been slow and sub -optimal. The number of people developing TB is not d eclining at 
a pace that would place countries on the path to end  TB by 2030. Within  this contex t, the TBSAP 
evaluation team has reached  the following con clusions : 
 
1. The TBSAP has laid a sound platform of int erventions  and contributed meanin gfully to t he 
NTP 
The TB SAP has laid a sound platform of interventions and protoc ols in the districts in which it 
works . The project has produc ed credible results towar d its four outcome indicators  and across the 
TB cas cade, with demonstrated value of  interventions  to improve screening, care, and treatment. 
The “whole systems ” approach implemented  by the TBSAP has made it possible to identify lever age 
points at all levels of government to locate appropriate interventions  in the TB cascade and package 
them in a comprehensiv e basket of technical assistance  services. Despite  the chall enges discussed 
throughout this report, the TBSAP ’s implementation has provided v aluab le lessons a nd tangible 
results that form a solid  found ation for sustainable future efforts against the TB epidemic in the 
country. If the interventions are taken to scale i n the project’s  districts , and if they are implemented 
in the  rest of the country by  the NTP, they have the potential to reduce TB i nciden ce and mortality 
in South Africa to levels set out in th e WHO End  TB Strategy : reduce the number of TB deaths by 
95 percent by 2030 ; and cut new cases by 90 percent between 2015 and 2035 with a fo cus on  
reaching key and vulnerable populations .  
2. The m ost effective components of TBSAP’ s approach identified are: 
• Relationship building : The evaluation team  documented  that the TB SAP is ski lled and well 
versed in forming and maintaining relat ionsh ips by  working within the structures of district 
management instead o f imposing its own agenda , and by communicatin g regularly, clearly , 
and openly with provinces, districts, facilities, project donor s, and the NTP.  
• Mentoring  and capacity development : District KIs unanimously agreed that the TBSAP sought 
to foster  district -level ownership of the interventions , largely because of the training 
provided by the project. This is especially true in terms of  community engagement via 
community institutions, whereb y the project also invested  in training  and mentorship of 
NGOs  suppor ting TB contr ol.  
• M
easures to reach key and vul nerable  populations: The TBSAP has demonstrated the inherent 
value of  its NGO ne twork model  in reach ing, testing , and in ducting vulnera ble populations 
into care and treatment.  The TBSAP ’s public -private partnerships, inclu ding an effective 
model with  private med ical practitioners and workplace PHC services  for such populations  
as farm w orkers and miners , demonstrated particular value for case finding . 
 
The evaluation also identified TBSAP ’s less eff ective inter ventions , which include:

WHO . https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/329368 .  
37 | Page  
 • Informati on system manageme nt: Although the  TBSAP made si gnificant eff orts to strengthen  
TB program d ata management  and support the transition of TB data from ETR.net to 
TIER. net, the challen ges to the health info rmation system  are an issue  that i s larger than the 
project itself and outside the TBSAP ’s control .  
• Advocacy, communications, and s ocial mobilizatio n): Inadequate strategic planning and the lack 
of appropriate impact measures for th e project’ s ACSM compo nent was a misse d 
oppor tunity to identify and implement a more cost- effective approach.  
• The ConnecTB app : The ConnecTB application  showed great progress  and promise but was 
halted during roll-out due to techn ological problems . 
 
Both the ACSM and Co nnecTB components were missed o pportunit ies to improve project results . The 
project adjusted its ACSM strategy and initiated  an assessment to determine the futu re direction for the  
ConnecTB app. However , both course correction s occurred over h alfway through projec t 
implementation.  
 3. The TBSAP was constrained by design and  planning defic iencies and healt h system  
challenges  
Althoug h the value of TBSAP  approaches has been demonstrated, the p roject  has been unable to 
scale them  up to cover  all facilities in project- supported  district s. The TBSAP team has had to  
deliver technical assistance on com plex TB inte rvention s in South A frica’s high-burde n environmen t, 
shaped by global policy, guided by the N TP guidelines , and delivered in  varied  district settings . 
Notable challenges affecting t he TBSAP include:  
• Project  planning and design: S tructural defi ciencies dating from the in itial projec t planning 
stages, such as project LoE allocated to districts, led to constrained performa nce, especially 
in terms of mentoring and  institutionalizing it s interventions at distric t and facility le vels. 
There was unani mous agreemen t among all district-level KIs from both DoH and the TBSAP  
(35/35)  that the TBSAP ha d fallen short in terms of mento ring DoH staff to implement what 
they had been taught  due to a lack of adequate TBSAP staff in the districts. URC is 
experienced in w orking  in South Africa’s province s, districts , and facilitie s, and is  familiar 
with the district health system challenges. Although  baseli ne assessments were carried out 
for each d istrict, t hey could have better contextualized their response to the o perati ng 
environment in each district . 
• N
GO network model funding : The manner of contracting  NGOs  (through  a one- year 
agreement) , require s resolution. At the end of the year, the loss of the NGO s’ 
contributions  and the consequent cost to the project is reflected in  higher LTFU rates.  
• Funding mechanism and performance expectatio ns: The TBSAP f unctions under a contra ct 
between URC and USAID. Contracts a re typically l ess flexible than  other mechani sms, 
which constrained the TBSAP ’s capacity to  adapt ; for example, to a djust the LoE allocated 
for district -level support. The four  project outcome indica tors set as the metrics for success 
do not well reflect or measure the brea dth and scope of the work i mplemented by the 
TBSAP . However, these indica tors are what the TBSAP  is held acc ountable for , that is,  the 
obligation t o justify it s actions and expen ditures in pursuit of performance. The contract 
does not hold the project accountable , for example,  for the number and types of vulnerable 
populations reached, the success of  its efforts  to incorporate the private sector in c ase 
finding , and its success assisting the NDo H to res olve dat a quality issues in  districts  and at 
facilities .  
NTP data  management and systems are the most significant challenge  adversely affecting effe ctive TB 
programming in South Afri ca’s health system . One KI descri bed dat a manageme nt as the “lifeblood  
38 | Page  
 of effective TB treatment.” Another described  the current  difficulties with data man agement in the 
NTP a s “a crisis.” Data collection, data an alysis, and data use are essential to implementing an 
effective and efficien t TB control system.  It is essential  for distr icts, provin ces, and the NTP to be 
able to report timely, accurate, and comp lete data to all lev els of the system,  and to use the data  
locally to strengthen management of  both TB patients and T B control activities. The data 
management issues, w hich span al l levels of the health system —from inadequ ate information systems 
to ins ufficient processes and  staff for facility -level data capturing and reporting —urgently need to be 
addressed and reso lved.  
 
4. The COVID -19 pandemic has the p otential to de rail NTP ga ins and exace rbate the country ’s 
TB epidemic  
The COVID -19 pandemic poses a serio us and severe threat  to the NTP in South Africa. TBSAP ’s 
support to the national response l everaged the similaritie s between COVID -19 and TB (in terms of 
transmission and , thus, prevention) , strengthening IPC measures  and conductin g TB screening in 
conjunc tion with COVID- 19 screening and awareness. However, as a largely facilit y-based program, 
the NTP will need to im plement significant a daptations and de epen the integration between  the two 
diseases to maximize finite m ateria l and human resources.     
39 | Page  
 Recomme ndations  
Short -term course corrections and recommendations for USAID and TBSAP 
through the end of the contract (March 2021):  
• Intensifi ed, direct support to  the NTP in data management and systems:  Data management and 
systems present the most significant cons traint to the NTP . They are further exacerbated by the 
impact of COVID -19. T he provision of direct, han ds-on assistance at facilit y and distric t-level 
DoHs in data clean -up and record -keeping are of critical importance,  and are in line with WHO 
“catch -up” measur es.  
o The TBSAP ’s appoi ntment of d ata captu rers should be context specific to the needs of 
each district and facilit y.  
o To be effective, da ta captu rers will need:  
 Adequate trainin g and  supervision to en sure the quality of data capture at all 
levels . 
 Access to hardware (computers, p rinter s), software, and internet connection s. 
 Access to physical space for  desks, data tea ms, files , and filing cab inets with 
suppor t and buy -in from the DoH and facility staff to work effi ciently. 
 USAID and TBSAP should app ly lessons learned from experiences with previous 
and on -going HIV data mop -up and systems shifts exercises. Experience with 
HIV partners shows that in -person, hands -on, skilled support yields significant ly 
better results.  
• Fast-track appro val and continui ty of NGO contracts:  The TBSAP should ensure the continuity of 
NGO contracts to support efforts toward  integrated COVID -19 and T B screening, intensified 
case finding, contact tracing, and reduced LTFU in communities, also in line with WHO “ catch-
up” measur es. 
• Leverage the pro ject’s strengths to  help the NTP adapt to the COVID -19 pandemic:  The TBSAP should 
further strengthen facility- level IPC measures and health worker capacity. The project should 
also identify and pilot program adaptations pi voted toward d ifferentiated models  of care and 
digital/remote services across the TB cascade. This includes self -screenin g, alternatives for 
medication access (such as the Central Chronic Medicine Dispensing and Distribution program 
and using NGOs for ho me or community m edicine delivery) , and virtual treatment adherence 
support (such as SMS reminders and “talking” pillboxes) .  
• End of project doc umen tation and transition plans for district and provincial DoH : The TBSAP has 
documented  its work extensively. I t has a complete r ecord of its outp uts, which should be 
widely shared with all stakeholders as valuable lessons learned and “how -to” guides , and made 
easily accessible via USAID, the NDoH and PDoH websites, URC’s website, and globally as 
journal publicatio ns.  
Medium-ter m recommendations to  USAID to ensure consistency of support in the 
TBSAP’s 14 high TB burden districts:  
• Ensure continuity of sup port: Provide a cost or no -cost extension to the current TBSAP contract, 
from April 2021 through the anticipated st art date and i nitiation of USAID’s follow -on TB 
project( s). In coordination with TBSAP and the DoH, USAID’s contract extension should ensure 
coverage of high -impact, priority interventions most critical to sustain gains in TB outc omes 
made over the last fi ve years.  Key interventions and activities in the medium (and long) term 
should align with the NTP and TB Think Tank “TB  Recovery Plan ,” and, to the extent possible, 
allow for flexibility and programmatic shifts in response to the rapidly  changing  TB and  COVID-
19 lands cape.  
40 | Page  
 Long-term reco mmendations for USAID in the design of its follow -on TB  project: 
• Funding mechanism:  A cooperative agreement mech anism would allow the follow -on TB project 
more flexibility in the use of funds, course c orrections , and timely r esponse s to new challenges, 
notably  in the context of COVID -19. The challenges of resource- poor health systems often 
require additional support  from development partners to refashion programs and to build more 
functional ways to effect change. A cooper ative agreement is a more appropriate mechanism for 
technical assistance than a contract in this context. 
• Appropriat e measures of accountabilit y: A comprehensive indicator set should be identified that 
spans the TB follow -on project(s)’ intermediate results and interventi ons. M&E should be 
integrated in every intervention, such as ACSM, with clear and measurable outcomes from these 
activities. Da ta management processes and expectations should account for South Africa’s 
ongoing contex t and limitations  in this regard for pro ject management (using data to inform 
programming) and reporting. USAID should also identify opportunities to address and suppo rt 
this health system constraint; for example, by providing short- term, hands -on support for 
facility -level data ma nagement or r oving district -level data quality assurance teams to facilitate 
quarterly data reporting.  
• Incorporate  and build on successful ap proaches from the TBSAP. The systematic screening of high -
risk groups through outreach and the use of NGOs has led to the prompt initiation of 
treatment for DS -TB and DR- TB clients. The FAST approach and CQI enhancements have 
substantively contributed to i mproveme nts in outcomes in the districts. The follow -on 
project(s) should build on these achievements. Moreover, th e capacity de velopment and 
mentor ing approach should be applied at multiple levels of the DoH to circumvent challenges 
related to staff turno ver, rotation, and reallo cation toward institutionalizing CQI.  
• Build on and expand public -private engagement and partnerships . The private sector ha s a wide 
reach and potential for valuable participation in the management of TB. Future follow -on 
project(s) ’ sub-grantees (such as NGOs and other partners) should be specifically tasked with 
collaboration with the private sector in an e ffort to find missi ng cases. This will: (1) improve 
screening and TB case management; (2) harmonize TB programming and build Na tional Health 
Insurance ( NHI) networks; (3) reduce TB in key populations; and (4) improve occupational 
health ser vices for TB (es pecially in smaller  mines) by building on lessons from the HIV program. 
Specific TBSAP public -privat e partnerships identified for s cale-up include:  
o The private medical practitioner project in the Eastern Cape, linking it to the NHI.  
o The wor k with THPs in Lim popo and KwaZulu- Natal.  
o The “TB in Farms” intervention, especially in such provinces as the Easter n Cape and 
KwaZulu -Natal.   
o Reaching miners as a pop ulation vulnerable to TB through their workplace, expanding 
especially to Free State and  Limpopo.  
• Ensure continuity of NGO  contributions: To optimize and sustain TB control contributions from the 
NGO network model, the follow -on TB project(s) should issue  contracts of the same duration 
as that of the project, or alter natively , have strong con tracting and ad ministrative processes to 
prevent service gaps.  
• Strengthen TB/HIV/COVID- 19 integration and coordination for improved program ou tcomes. The 
follow -on TB project(s) should adopt successful program adaptations from the TBSAP as it 
pilots alter native approach es relevant to the C OVID- 19 response. USAID should assess the 
hardware (such as computers) and inter net connectivity needs to fa cilitate data management and 
remote/online learning and support, and incorporate a related investment component i n the 
follow -on project(s). Pivoting to remote learning using existing platforms, such as the NDoH’s 
Knowledge Hub for professional development, wh ich incorporate offline functionality, may reach 
more health workers while allowing them to learn at their ow n pace and savi ng on in-person  
41 | Page  
 training costs. At a donor (USAID) and USG interagency level, USAID and the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prev ention  should increase coordination for program planning and 
resource allocation across activities (projects), in cluding built -in mandates and platf orms for 
collaboration.   
42 | Page  
 Recommendations for the NDoH and NTP:  
• Address the country’s information management  system challenges.  Resolving the information 
management system issues is crucial to the national effort to reduce T B incidence and mortality. 
It will also contribute to improved case management, treatment initiation, and adherence 
support; enhance digital  patient tracing, tracking, and monitoring systems developed for the 
COVID- 19 response; a nd reduce data backlogs for  TB and HIV pr ograms. Specific a ctions 
include: 
o Strengthen data recording and reporting through continued traini ng and mentorship of 
M&E per sonnel  at district and facility levels.  
o Oversee completion of the transition of TB data from ETR.net to TIER.Net,  ensuring 
the p rovision of adequate training and clear guidance to all stakeholders on access.  
o Support the development of the Unique Patient Id entifiers to avoid data duplication and 
to connect lab data to individual patient care.  
o Strengthen laboratory inf ormation manage ment systems by impr oving the use of 
laboratory data for case finding and linkage to care (providing  the results directly to the 
patient), and expanding the Rif Alert to all districts.  
• Oversee an assessment of and manage health system softw are application s. The NDoH should 
conduct a “best return on investment” analysis of mobile applications, including ConnecTB, 
toward streamlinin g and aligning existing technology. Applications should be  device, software, 
and platform -agnostic (able to inter act with all file  types or able to exchange data with any other 
software). Software should run on any type of device, such as deskto ps, tablets , and 
smartphones.  This will minimize the frequent over -investment in hardware and software to run 
the apps.  
• Strengthen NTP coor dination and ACSM . Given the relatively small number of TB implementing 
partners, the NDoH should facilitate a technical working  group to align interventions and 
messaging and enhance coordination and collaboration to  better leverage stakeho lders’ 
respecti ve strengths and use  of limited resources. For example, this technical working group 
should develop a centralized ACSM s trategy for the NTP  to which all implementing partners 
contribute (financially and technically) and implement. This strat egy should inco rporate 
marketing principles, such as specific audience targeting, and the most relevant platforms f or 
each audience and  in the context of COVID- 19 (such as social media).

 I. PURPOS E OF T HE EVALUATION  
 
Purpose  
USAI D/South Africa seeks to carry out a midterm eva luation of its Tuberculosis (TB)  South Afri ca 
Project (TBSAP), to examine how the project’s interventio ns have helped  achieve the National 
Department of H ealth (NDoH) and Missi on’s g oal to reduce TB burden in South Africa and to identify 
areas for im provement.  
 
The objectives of this ev aluation are three- fold:  
1) To determine the extent to which the TBSAP responds to the Government of South Afri ca’s TB 
priorities (National Strategic Plan 2017-22 and  National TB Program Strategic Pl an 2017 -2021)  
2) To iden tify key lessons learned, best pra ctices and chal lenges which w ill inform the strategic 
design of the follow -on TB project  
3) To lea rn from midterm pr ogram success es and challenges in t he TBS AP program and  
recommend course corrections for  the second half  
 
The TBSAP  midterm evaluation will con solidate learni ngs, co llabora tion and adaptation across the 
project, identifying key factors, interventions and investments th at contribute to the s uccess es and 
challen ges of the project in  reducing the TB burden (mortality and mor bidity) across South Afri ca. This 
evalua tion wi ll also  identify and document opportunities for future improvement,  including possible 
approaches that w ere not part of the cu rrent activities.  
 
Audiences  
There are three distinc t audiences who should receive  and make use of these ev aluation findin gs. The  
first includes USAID and PEPFAR, to inform their current and futur e prog ramming and implem enting 
partne rs currently working i n TB. T he second is the Government of South Africa stakeholders at central  
and p rovincial/district levels, n otably those working at the NDoH and in the TB/HIV program. Third are 
other implementing partne rs and nongovernmental stakehol ders (including the TB  steering committee,  
other donors, and pr ivate sector  partners engaged in TB pre vention and care).  
 Intended Us es 
This eva luation  seeks to inform current and future TB interventions in South Africa, especially given the 
high burden o f disease, and its dis propor tionate contri bution to morbidity and mortality  in South Africa. 
USAID wil l use the TBSAP midterm eval uation findings  to und erstand  better the most effective 
approaches to inform the second half of  this project and future progra mmin g with the continued goa l of 
reducing the burden of TB acro ss South Afr ica. The evaluation w ill also inform NDoH and other G OSA 
stakeholders about a ctivity  achievements, successes, failures, and opportunities going forwar d. The 
midterm eva luation will al so document results achiev ed against nat ional and global targ ets, promisi ng 
practices and lessons learn ed from the project in a way that can be  easily consum ed by key stakeholders 
across South Africa.  
 
II. SUMMARY INFORMA TION  
In keeping with US AID’s global TB  strategy, USAID/South Afr ica is committed to supporting the 
Government o f South Africa’s effo rts to prevent and control TB, add ressing local n eeds an d prior ities as 
well as fostering sustainability of the National Departme nt of Health’s TB approaches. U SAID is also 
keen to ensure investments are c oordinated well with the NDoH and other donors (suc h as t he Global 
Fund, World Bank, BMGF ) to increase thei r impac t and sustainability. USAID identifies and invests in 
progra ms and  policies that have the greates t potential to end the epide mic.   
 U
SAID/ South Africa works in  partnership with the NDoH and its part ners to identify and provide high- 
45 | Page  
 quality, patient- center ed care and treatment to individuals with active TB and those most  at risk of 
develo ping active T B and MDR and XDR- TB. USAID works closely wit h the NDoH to develop, 
implement, and track the suc cess o f comprehensive, sustainable  national TB st rategies and p rograms. 
This support includes helping GoSA to identify and addres s gaps in their TB  programs and  adopt new, 
evidence-b ased, context- specif ic and locally led pr actices and policies. Consistent with WHO ’s End TB 
Strategy and the national TB strategy,  USAID works to:  
● Improve access to high -quality, patient -centered T B, DR -TB, and TB/HIV ser vices  
● Prevent TB transmission and diseas e progression   
● Strengthen TB servi ce delivery platforms  
● Accelerate resear ch and innovation  
● Improve i nternational c apacity and collaboration to combat multi -drug resistant tuberculosis

III. BACK GROUND  
 
a. Description of the Problem and Context  
South Africa is one of the highest- ranking c ountries in the  world in terms of T B burd en according to 
WHO estimates, with a high inc idence rate of 567 new  infecti ons per 100,000 persons in 2017. South 
Africa’s TB chal lenge is compounded by high numbers of multidrug- resista nt TB (MD R-TB) and 
extensively drug -resista nt TB (XDR- TB) cases . WHO f urther estim ated that 14,000 of t he roughly 
322,000 incident cases are MD R or rifampicin resistant. L ikewise, appro ximately  193,00 0 (60%) of the 
incident cases are estimated to be co infected  with HIV, further exace rbating chall enges in providing 
treatment and care to  patients.  
 
Guided by a nd consist ent with global strategies an d policies (WHO End TB, USG Glob al TB Str ategy, 
White House National Action Plan for TB), South Africa’s TB prog ram h as made progress in sust aining 
trends  in reducing mortality  due to TB; loweri ng TB  incidence rates , including reducing the incidence  of 
co-diagnosed TB /HIV; and improv ing treatmen t success rates for most categories of cases. WHO 
confirms a clear and s ustained  downward trend in TB  case notific ations in South Africa, which WHO 
postulates might be driven by  high ART coverage rates.  
 
However, ch allenges remain before South  Africa can reach its TB elimination goals. A key gap is the 
estimated 101,837 incid ent cases that were not notified or not di agnosed in 2017. The c ountry  is falling  
short of 2025 End TB go als. Treat ment coverage was 68%  in 2017  and treatment success was 8 2% 
(among ca ses who in itiated  treatment in 2004) versus a 2025 target of 90%. In 2017 Sou th Africa 
reported that of the 15,986 l aboratory -confirmed MDR/ri fampicin re sistan t cases, only 10 ,259 (64%) 
began treatment. Furth ermore, the treatment success rate i n 2014 of 54  per cent for patients with 
multidrug -resistant TB (MDR -TB) remains low.  
  
46 | Page  
 Of the 123,148 TB patients who are known  to be HIV -positive, 1 09,799 (89%) of t hese patients were 
repor ted to be on antiretroviral therapy for  HIV.33 Additionally, 53% of HIV positive people ne wly 
enrolled in HIV care are on TB preventive treatment. South Afri ca’s TB efforts are larg ely funded by  
domestic sources (91% ), international (8%), and unfunded (le ss than 1%).34 
 
b. Description of the  Interven tions to be Evaluated and T heories  of Change  
 
The overar ching project goal of TBSAP is to reduce the national TB, M/ XDR- TB, and TB/HIV burde n in 
South Af rica. This activity co ntribut es to achi eving USAID Mission’s De velopment Objective 1: ‘Health 
outcomes  for South Africans improved ’, as expres sed in the Countr y Development Cooperation 
Strategy (CDCS). This activity also responds to the National Strategic Plan  for HIV, TB and STIs (2 017-
2022); Nation al TB Program St rategic Plan  (2017 – 2021); USG G lobal TB  strategy (2015 -2019); and t he 
White House Nationa l Actio n Plan to combat Multidrug Resistant TB (Goal 2) - improving  international 
capacity and collabora tion to combat multidr ug-resistant tuberculos is (MDR- TB). The  primary obj ectives 
of the activi ty are to : 1) reduce TB infections; 2) i ncrease the sustai nabilit y of effective TB response 
systems; and 3) improve care and treatment of vulnerable populations.”  The specific IRs and sub -IRs are

IV. EVALUATION QUESTIONS  
This evaluation seeks to answer  the following key evaluation que stions. Sub -lines of inquiry for each 
question are included in Annex II.  
 
1. To what extent ha s TBSAP  been effective/successful in achieving its stated objectives a nd 
targets? 
2. What key interventions  and activities have b een mos t effectiv e/high  impact in achie ving results ? 
(Which are least or  less ef fective?)  
3. What challenges an d constraints does the projec t face and what course corrections might 
improve this?  
4. What has changed in the epidemiology and env ironment of TB in So uth Af rica, and h ow has  this 
affected the  program?  
 
Recommendations will  stem fr om key findings and conclusions within the report and will include at a 
minimum: recommended continuation and/or scale up of priority activities as well a s course corrections 
for the second hal f of the TBSAP project, and recom mendations for the design of the follow -on flagship 
TB pr ogram.  
 
V. EVA LUATION DE SIGN AND METHODOLOGY  
The evaluation team will propose a comprehensive  design for addressin g the evaluatio n questions and 
will addre ss how choices wi ll be made relat ed to selecti ng country/geographi c focus a nd intervention 
activities/results , to maximize the abil ity of the evaluation to develop findings based on evidence and  that 
will be relevan t to the broa dest possible range of  activities.  
Within this design, the e valuation tea m will propose the best and most rigorous methods for da ta 
collectio n appropri ate to address the evaluation questions. This will include a mix of  secondary data and 
desk review, and si te visits to collect qualitative (key  informant interviews,  small group  and focus group 
discussions) and quantitative (community , partner an d/or facility -based surveys, electronic surveys) 
primary data collection. The  evaluation team will co nduct Team Pr eparation Meetings to discuss further 
detailed of data collec tion and analysis methods. Annex III prov ides an illustrative “Illust rative Analytical 
Framework for the Evaluation” matrix, including a range of potential da ta collection methods th at may  
48 | Page  
 be sui table for each evaluation qu estion. This matr ix will be fur ther develop ed by the evaluation team in 
the Evaluation Design Proposal .   
Existi ng Informati on Sour ces 
The following is an illustrative, non -exhaustive list of  materials that will be available for  review as part of 
this eval uation’s secondar y documentatio n and data r eview:  
• Annual, quarter ly and monthly reports from the TBSA P project  
• USAID’s RFP/RFA, Co operative Agreement/contract, and modifications for the TBSA P project  
• USAID/South Af rica CDCS and  current mission TB in dicato rs 
• M&E pl ans, PMPs, work plans,  and data and narratives reported a gainst these, including indicator 
data tabl es covering each year of implementation  
• Research, innovations, best practices, and  other documents, papers , highlights an d reports 
published/ dissem inated by  the TBS AP 
• Baseline, m id-project  and other research initi atives (from TBSAP and other TB prog rams in SA 
relevant to  this p roject)  
• The final evaluation of the former “TB programme  for South Africa”  
• Global guidelines and st rategies, namely the WHO E nd TB Strategy, U SG Global TB Strategy, 
White House National Action Plan fo r TB 
• Government of South Af rica and NDoH strategies and other official documents, such as the 
National TB Strategic P lan (both 2012- 2016 and  2017- 2022) a nd TB data at the nati onal a nd sub -
national l evel 
Data Ana lysis Meth ods 
Data analysis methods to be p roposed by the evaluation tea m will follow closely from th e methods used 
to collect each type of data needed to answer  the evaluation questions. Whatever d ata analysis methods 
are cho sen for this evaluation, they shoul d be ju stified in terms of their fit w ith the data collected for 
each question and the types of answers that USAID seeks. Time and cost considerations are a lso 
important in this area. The evalu ation team’s proposed design  for this  evaluat ion should co nside r the 
most appropriate sequence for an swering each question, based on the data that will be collected and 
analyzed for each question.  
 
Gender Considerations  
In accordance with USAI D policy (Aut omated Directive System (ADS ) 201 point 7), t he research d esign 
for th is evaluation will consider gen der-specific and differential effects o f the TBSAP project . The 
evaluation team will explore gender aspects of the acti vities per the question s and data so urces available 
but wi ll not  seek to aggregat e or integrate data acr oss those activities.  
 USA ID Participation  
Regular communication b etween  the evaluation team and the designated USAID Activity Manager will be 
essentia l to the successful execution of the TBSAP midterm evaluation. Th e evaluat ion team  will keep 
the MER L offic e and USAID apprised of changes  and developments that necess itate a ny significant 
decisio n-making or modification of the approved evaluation design. P ossible USAID participa tion in the 
data collection tool developm ent phase  of the evaluation wi ll be discus sed in the meetings, prior to the  
start of fieldwork. Weekly  check -ins from the Te am Lead  or MERL Evaluation Support Consultant will 
ensure activities remain of quality and on course.  
As per USAID policy, th e incep tion rep ort/desi gn proposal, draft  report, final report and all PowerPoi nt 
presentations will receive  formal approval prior  to the next phase of the evaluation.

 Annex II: Evaluation Methods and Limitations  
Key Informant Interview s 
In-depth in terviews and small  group discussions were conducted with key informants at nationa l, 
provincial , and district levels. At the  central/national level, USA ID, ND oH, other donors , implementing 
agencies , and partners were interviewed. At provincial , district, f acility, and co mmunity  levels , the team 
interviewed a range of N DoH manage rs and frontline health workers, TBSAP staff, communit y partner 
organizations,  and o ther implementing partners working in TB.  
 
Data Sources  
The evaluation drew on relevant national an d internation al docu ments; thes e are further outlined in 
Annex IV.  
 Data Analysis  
Qualitative Data Analysis : Qualitative data were collected from consenting participants , and adherence to 
confidenti ality and eth ical practice were maintained . An interview tool/questionnair e was sent to the KIs 
to enable them to prepare for the interview , to fill in the questionn aire, and to send  back it to the 
evaluation team in those cases when interviews could not be conducted. Data were collected us ing 
voice recorders and mobile phones f or interviews with all K Is. Some informants , such as T BSAP 
personnel and NGO  staff, respond ed by both filling in the questionnaire and via interviews.  
A codebook was developed using the QDA Miner  software program (a C omputer  Assisted Qualitative 
Data Analy sis tool – CAQDAS). The co des were designed to respond  to the project themes on 
reduced TB infections , care , and treatment of vulnerable populations , and sustainability of effective TB 
response s ystems. The codes  are indicat ed in Figure 7.  
64 | Page  
 Figure 7: Qual itative Data Codes  
 
Recorded interviews were transcribed and codes were a ssigned to each response u sing QDA Miner  
(Figure 8). The results of the qualitative a nalysis were used to esta blish corr oborati ng evidence from the 
quantitative analysis. C onnections between the project themes enabled the evaluators to see how 
relationships across the m ultiple role  players were managed to implement key TB interventions and  to 
identify gaps and opportunities  for im provement.   
65 | Page  
 Figure 8: Example of Qualitati ve Data Transcription  
 
Quantitative Data Analysis:  The p erform ance of the TBSAP wa s assessed on the basis of baseline data 
from the DHIS, the Distr ict Health Ba rometer , TBSAP reports , and m ultiple sources fro m health 
departments and other researchers. Four treatment outcome indicators wer e the major focus of th e 
evaluation:  
i. 90% Treatment Success Rate for drug -susceptible TB (D S-TB) cases  
ii. 75% Treatment Success Ra te for DR-TB cases 
iii. 100% init iation of confirmed DR- TB cases on  appropriate treatment  
iv.  90% ART coverage for TB/HIV coinfected patients  
 
In addition to reviewi ng the se indicators , the evaluation sought to examine the trends i n the 
implemen tation of the pro ject over the contract period . The performance of TBSAP was fur ther 
assessed by comparing its performance against eight comparison districts , including  four high TB burden, 
two m edium, and t wo low burden dist ricts. The eight comparison distric ts were selec ted from the 
remaining nin e of th e original 23 TBSAP districts allocated to the project in 2016, but where TBSAP 
does not  currently operate.  
Several  unforeseen  challenges and limitations s everely constrained the evaluation team ’s ability to draw 
any substantive conclusions from this  comparative analysis . DHIS data were available through 2017 only 
(and fo r a handful  of data points  in 2018) ; as such, the compariso n assesses the initial year of  TBSAP 
implementation only. It is therefore premature to expect outcome- level performance differences.  In 
addition, the TBSAP was assigned some of the highest burde n dist ricts, with the highest caseloads and 
the most challenging contextual factors. This in cludes  the major metropolitan areas of the City of 
Johanne sburg, City of Tshwane, eThekwini, and Cape Town. As metros, these districts may have better -
resourced fac ilities and  systems, but they also have higher population dens ity and client mobility. The 
compa rison districts are all high burden dis tricts ; they all had some level of partner support. Given the 
added constraints and challenges faced in conducting this  evaluation  during lockdown (in terms of travel   
66 | Page  
 restrictions , limited access to data, etc.) , the comparison was based solely on DHIS data for the period 
indicated above, and did not control for other  factors or predictors of performance, such as the relative 
strengths of the DoH, data management systems, etc.  The list of TBSAP and comparison d istricts is 
given in Table 5 .

 Triangulati on: The mixed methods approach proved usefu l in providing multiple lines of sight a nd in 
allowing  the convergence  of the varied contexts in which the project pr ovides support. The use of 
multip le measures revea led unique similarities and variations in the selected areas tha t may h ave been 
missed ha d this methodology not been used . Collecting  both qual itative and q uantitative data  allowed 
the evaluation team to compare responses acr oss sources and data types. An it erative analysis enabl ed 
the integration of the various data s ources and findings. It w as possible to identify contradictions 
between data sources and to consol idate conclusions based on the KIIs. Triangu lation created an 
awareness of issues that were no t anticipated, and the v alidation of findings by looking for sim ilarities 
and discrepancies across data sources.  
  
Evaluation Cha lleng es and Mi tigation Stra tegies 
The evaluation team identified the followin g evaluation challe nges and mi tigation strategies.  
 
Table 6: Evaluation Challenges and Mitigation Strategies  
Challenge  Mitigation Strategy  
COVID -19 
The prioritization of the COV ID-19 emergency 
response and timing of the lockdown led to delays in 
fieldwork and KIIs conduct ed. 
 In May, Panagora and USAID agreed  that fieldwork 
should procee d with all available K IIs, the bulk of which 
would be fro m national -level stakehold ers and TBS AP 
staff. In June-July, the evaluation  team, with assistance 
from the TBSAP project , was ultimately successfu l in 
interviewing KIs from provin cial and district DoH s, 
whose c ontribut ions are included in t his report.  
Panagora and USAID  agreed to include key 
stakeholders (e.g., the NDoH and NT P) not available 
during the evaluation time frame as an anne x to fo llow, 
pending avai lability.  
Interviews were con ducted virtually and not in person, 
with technolog ical challenges in reaching KIs, and in the  
clarity of calls and audio recordings . Panagora  contrac ted CADRE, which provided technical 
guidance on the best te chnological option s for the 
clarity of calls and  audio recordings. Th e evaluation 
team and TBSAP worked cl osely to confirm what 
platform best  suited the various interviewees (phone, 
WhatsApp, Zoom,  etc.) in adva nce of each call.  
Data Avail ability  
TB data sets were avai lable at the district lev el only; 
therefore, the analysi s of qua ntitative results at the 
facility level could not be conducted as initi ally planned. 
DHIS data for TB were available t hrough 2017 only—
for the first year of project implementatio n only. The TB te am conducted district -level analysis of results 
with comparison  districts  through 2017 only . Proje ct 
data from  the TBSAP and q ualitative d ata from the KIIs 
provided insights on  successes and li mitations, serving 
to tri angulat e the evaluati on team ’s findings.

 Annex V I: Additional TBSA P Materials  
TBSAP Alignment with the National TB Program  
The goal of the NTP Strategy 2017 ‒2021 is “To re duce the est imated incidence and mortality of TB in  
South Africa” and the T BSAP  project goal is to “ reduce the TB burden in South Arica,” a close 
alignment.  The NTP ’s Find-Treat-Prevent Framework includes case identification through incr eased facility -
level TB screening and active case finding in  special populations ; treating TB clients by s caling up 
appro priate short course treatments for DR -TB and reducing initial LTFU for DS -TB and DR- TB cases ; 
and decreasing TB infections by scaling  up pr eventive therapy for people living with H IV and household 
contacts . The NTP strategy ’s cross -cutting inte rventions in clude o ptimizing systems for data us e and 
quality improvement to close gaps in the TB care cascade . 
 
The TBSAP project activ ities were designed to complement this framework through the three 
Intermediate Results :   
1) reduce TB infections   
2) increase the sustainability of effective TB response sy stems   
3) improve  care and treatment of vulnera ble populations   
 Activities through these th ree Intermediate Results  complement the NTP’s strategy interventions, as 
summarized in the table below .  
 
Table 8: TBSAP Activity Alignment with the National TB Program Strategy  
NTP Strategy  Aligned TBSAP Project Activities  
FIND:  Increa sed 
facility lev el TB 
screening  • Expansion and consolidation of the FAST strategy in 102 FAST eligible fa cilities in the 
11 supported districts.  
• Expansion of community involvem ent interventions and en sure bi -directional and 
functional links with the Primary Health Care (P HC) system. Form al and informal 
linkages between the PHC and organizations and institutions that work with TB key 
populations has been enhanced  for each catchme nt area of the PHC fac ility/Health 
facility.  
• Micro -targeted IPC campaigns in ho tspots and ensur e functional linkage with the TB 
care cascade to increase facility level screening. The IPC campaigns educate 
communities about the r isks of TB  transmission and  the importance of see king care. 
Demand generation, advocacy and social mobiliza tion encourage c ommunities to 
utilize and to access TB testing and treatment services. 
• A focus on health managers, primary health area supervisors and local area managers: 
strengthening leadership, ma nagement and governance capacities through technical 
assistance and cont inuous quality i mprovement.  
FIND:  Improve 
Active Case Finding in special populations  
• Optimized TB 
Screening  
• Efficient contact tracing of inde x 
cases  
• Enhanced case 
detection among • Optimized T B Screenin g: FAST approach targeting 102 hospital s and 8 CHCs in 11 
supported districts.  
• Efficient contact tracing of inde x cases: community mobilization, including door to door 
campaigns.  
• Enhanced case detecti on among key populations: A  focus on margina lized, vulne rable 
populatio ns, as well as those m ost at-risk, through contact tracing, management and 
TB cas e-monitoring; e xpandi ng community involvement in and links with the PHC 
system for DOTS delivery; and i ncreasing formal and informal linkages with 
organizatio ns and institutio ns that work with thes e populations. These also includes:  
o TB in farms initiative: A total of 88 fa rms were reached across Sarah

key populations  
• Improving 
diagnostic yield through new diagnostic tools and revised  
algorithms  
• Improved quality standards in recording, reporting and tracking pati ent 
transfers 
between facilities  Baartman (5), uMkhanyakude in Waterberg (5) and West Coa st (7) districts.  
o Private Public Partnership s: Facilit ating finding the  missing TB patients a t 
community level and increasing TB case detection and mana gement by 
private GPs in OR Tambo District.  
• Improving diagnostic yield through new diagnostic tools an d revised algorithms: New 
diagnostics such as  the LF -LAM tool for PLWHIV  and other immunocompr omised 
individuals seen at hospital level. This is an effective interventi on considering that 60% 
of PLWHIV are also co infected with TB. 
Improved quality standards in recording, reporting and tracking patien t transfe rs between 
facilities: A focus on linka ges to care and reducing loss to follow- up; updating of reco rds 
and data c lean-up exercises at all levels of GoSA TB data and reporting systems (Tier.Net 
and EDR.W eb) at facility, province and national levels . 
TREAT:  Scale up 
appropr iate short 
course trea tments 
for DRTB  Strengthen programmatic and clinical managem ent of DRTB: TBSAP support to the NTP to 
ensure improved access to high -qualit y, patient -centered diagn ostic and treatment 
services, enhancing adherence to T B and MDR -TB trea tment and preventing t he 
transmission of TB and MDR -TB within health care facilities and communi ty settings.  At 
district level TBSAP has concentrated on  impro ving the capabilities of clinicians at facility 
level to improve clinical management and quality  of care via onsite ment orship and 
capacity building.  
Improve DRTB treatment Out comes:  TBSAP d oes this by: (1) Providing TA  to strengthen 
patient education, support and counselling for DRTB patients with an emphasis on 
treatment  adherenc e and minimizatio n of transmission; (2)  Addressing loss to follow up 
through patient tracking and t racing and upd ating treatment outcomes on the system.  
Strengthen  Capacity to manage DRTB through dece ntralization of services:   
• More technical sta ff have b een contracted fo r the high burden and ho tspots in the 14 
supported districts to provide technical assistance and  suppo rt to the 202 
decentralized facilities  
• All 202 DRTB decentralized sites are support ed with an emphasis on the key 
elements of health and community systems  and services to ensur e improved DRTB 
care and management:   
o Baseline and quality assessment  
o Managemen t support 
o DR-TB implementati on and operations team  
o Model (MOC) and Standard of Care  (SOC) 
o Referral pathways design  
 Up and down r eferral
