Introduction: Heart failure (HF) is one of the main causes of morbimortal-
ity in Brazil. However, little is known about the characteristics of the Brazil-
ian HF population assisted at the community level, including the use of HF
medications and frequency of hospitalizations. ePHealth is an app-based
large-scale digital data collection platform that currently has health data onmore than 1.5 million people.
Purpose: T o assess the use of evidence-based HF medications, hospital-
izations and epidemiological characteristics of HF patients in Brazil.Methods: This is an observational retrospective study of the digital health
data collected using the ePHealth platform on individuals, who self-
reported a diagnosis of HF . Data collected included sociodemographics,clinical data, risk factors, comorbidities, medications and hospitalizations.
Results: Data collected at more than 40,000 home visits on 5907 individ-
uals with HF were analysed. Majority of them were female, aged 55 to 75
years and brown (Figure 1). About 36% were married, 20% were illiterate,65% were retired and 66% earned ≤2 minimum wages. Mean BMI was
26.7 kg/m
2(SD 5.9), risk factors and comorbidities were frequent (Figure
1). The use of HF medications was very low (T able 1). There were 575 hos-pitalizations (9.7%), due to the main following reasons: probable or deﬁnite
heart failure decompensation (89, 15.5%), heart attack (60, 10.4%), car-
diovascular procedures (54, 9.4%) and stroke (42, 7.3%).
Conclusion: This data suggests that community-level use of evidence-
based cardiovascular medications in a population of individuals with HF inBrazil is very low and that hospitalizations are frequent. This study also pro-
vides a better understanding of the characteristics of a population of HF in-
dividuals, using large-scale real-world data collected on a community-levelvia an entirely digital platform. ePHealth is a disruptive platform able to pro-
vide data on the burden of HF and other cardiovascular diseases, informing
decisions on implementation of prevention and management programmes.
