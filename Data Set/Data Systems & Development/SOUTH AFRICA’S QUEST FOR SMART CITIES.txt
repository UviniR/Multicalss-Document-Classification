ABSTRACT  
Contribution  This study contributes to scientific literature by detailing the impact of  specific 
factors on the privacy concerns of  citizens living in an African city . 
Findings  The findings reveal that the more that impersonal data is collected by the Smart 
City of  Cape Town, the lower the privacy concerns of  the digital natives. The 
findings also show that the digital natives have higher privacy concerns when 
they express a strong need to be aware of  the  security mea sure put in place by 
the city.  
Recommendations  
for Practitioners  Practitioners (i.e. , policy makers) should ensure that it is a legal requirement to 
have security measures in place to protect the privacy of  the citizens while co l-
lecting data within the s mart city  of  Cape Town. These regulations should be 
made public to appease any apprehensions from its citizens towards smart city 
implementations. Less personal data should also be collected on the citizens.  
Recommendation  
for Researchers  Researchers should further investigate issues related to privacy concerns in the 
context of  African developing countries . Such is the case since the population 
of  these countries might have unique cultural and philosophical perspectives that might influence how they perceive privacy.  
Impact on Society  Cities are becoming “smarter ” and, in the context of  developing countries , pri-
vacy issues might not be such a major concern  as is the case in the developing 
world.  
Future Research  Further qualitative studies should be conducted to better understand issues r e-
lated to perceived benefits, perceived control, awareness of  how data is collec t-
ed, and level of  privacy concerns of  digital natives in developing countries.  Smart Cities and Privacy Concerns

INTRODUCTION  
Several cities around the world are moving towards acquiring the “smart city ” status and several Afr i-
can cities are j oining this quest  (Anthopoulos &  Fitsilis, 2013; Watson, 2015). A smart city is a city 
that incor porates the use of  Information and Communication T echnologies (ICT) and the Internet 
of  Things  (IoT)  in the management and monitoring of  city resources ( J. Lee, Hancock , & Hu, 2014). 
Cities such as Vienna and Barcelona are establishing themselves as world leaders in the smart city 
movement ( March & Ribera -Fumaz, 2016 ; Schleicher, Vogler, Inzinger , & Dustdar, 2015 ).  
The concept of  smart cities in the African context is new and still needs more exp loration (Chourabi  
et al., 2012; Nfuka & Rusu, 2010) . Moreover,  smart city implementations in African cities are still 
lagging behind  those of  European cities (Watson, 2015). Nonetheless , many African cities such as 
Cape Town in South Africa and Nairobi in Kenya have implemented smart city projects such as free 
Wi-Fi in public places and cashless payment systems for public transport (Albino,  Berardi , & Da n-
gelico, 2015; J. Lee  et al., 2014). In addition, m any of  the smart city services that can be found in self -
described European smart cities such as Barcelon a can also be found in Cape Town (Volkwyn, 2017).  
Data is constantly being produced and consumed in smart cities (Kitchin, 2015). Data from different 
sources are integrated together, with the aim of  acquiring a full picture of  the city ’s status in terms of  
safety and  economic vitality and in terms of  resources usage (March &  Ribera -Fumaz ., 2016). A s a 
result, generating and using this data often raises issues around  data security and data privacy (Li, 
2012).  
RESEARCH PROBLEM  
With this current period being coined as ‘the digital age ’, it is not surprising that one of  the challen g-
es of  our time is privacy (Acquisti, Taylor , & Wagman, 2016). In today ’s society, the threat of  perso n-
al data being abused for financial gain, social discriminat ion, or coercion is real (Edwards , Hofmeyr , 
& Forrest, 2016). In the past , there have been several instances where people ’s personal information 
was collected by government agencies without their awareness . An example of  such an incident was 
when it was re vealed  by WikiLeaks that a United States government agency called the National Sec u-
rity Agency (NSA) collected personal information such as phone records, emails, bank tra nsactions, 
travel records, and I nternet searche s of  millions of  people (N. Lee, 2015). It cannot be as sumed that 
these highly publicis ed incidents of  people ’s information being used without their awareness  and 
consent went unnoticed by digital natives in Cape Town, South Africa.  
Smart city projects have been known to bring benefits to  cities such as sustainable economic deve l-
opment (Castro, Jara , & Skarmeta, 2013). H owever , one may wonder how certain factors influence 
the privacy concerns that come along with the implementation of smart cities , particularly in the A f-
rican context. In a  time when information can be easily transferred, accessed ,and even shared, it is 
no surprise that people may have inclinations to be very protective of  their personal information 
(Elhai, Levine , & Hall, 2017).  
RESEARCH PURPOSE  
Many studies have  been done  on smart cities in Europe  and in emerging economies like the Far East. 
However, Backhouse (2015) states that “little has been done to understand how this concept is pla y-
ing out on the African continent, although many African cities are pursuing smart city  agendas ” 
(p. 1). The objective of  this study is , therefore , to investigate the impact of  awareness, perceived be n-
efits, types of  collected  data, and perceived control on the privacy concerns of  digital natives living in 
the smart city of  Cape Town, South Africa.  Tshiani & Tanner  
57 In line with the objective of  the study, t he research question is:  
What is the impact of  need for awareness, awareness of data collection method, perceived 
benefits, types of data collected , and perceived control on the privacy concerns of digital 
natives living in the smart city of  Cape Town, South Africa?  
The study specifically investigated the privacy concerns of  the citizen s (foreign & local)  of  Cape 
Town born between the years of  the late 1980s to mid -1990s . While the privacy concerns of  non -
citizens (i.e., visitors) are also relevant, the study specifically focuses on citizens  as they are the ones 
who reside in the city on a long term basis. This was investigated using a quantitative ap proach.  
IMPORTANCE OF THE STUDY  
It is important to study the implementation of  smart cities in Africa as research shows that by 2050 
almost 70% of  the world’ s people will live in cities (Shanahan  et al. , 2017). Law makers of  African 
cities need to find efficient ways to accommodate all these people and encourage them to use smart 
cities technolog ies. The purpose of  this is to reduce the likelihood  of  African cities investing massive 
amounts of  money into a smart city projects that may end up eventually f ailing (Backhouse, 2015).  
LITERATURE REVIEW  
This section examines the current literature relating to the characteristics and implementations  of  
smart cities  in Cape Town, South Africa  and the privacy concerns associated with smart cities.  
CH ARACTERISTICS  OF SMART CITIES  
Cities around the world are attempting to transform into smart cities, in order to be more economi-cally competitive and promote sustainable growth (Roche, Nabian, Kloeckl, & Ratti, 2012) . Accor d-
ing to past studies, the most common characte ristics of  Smart Cities are “Smart ” Governance, 
“Smart ” Environment, “Smart ” Living Environment, and a “Smart ” Economy.  
• “Smart ” Governance  relates to the use of  digital technology in public and government or-
ganisations as well as  in social services  (Rosati & Conti, 2016) . Having an efficient and inte l-
ligent transportation systems is what makes a city  ‘smart ’ in relation to governance  (Kond e-
pud et al., 2016) . An example of  a city ’s smart governance initiative is the usage of  Infor-
mation Technology ( IT) (e.g., Smart LEDs)  to monitor and lower  the Energy consumption 
within  the city (Chourabi et al., 2012) .  
• “Smart ” Environment relates to  sustainable resource management through the use of  ICT 
(Caragliu, Nijkamp , & Del Bo, 2011) . A city with a “smart ” environment make s use of big 
data, IoT , and various other technologies in the ru nning and planning of  the city ’s infr a-
structure and  during  the provision  of  city services  (Chourabi  et al., 2012) . 
• A “Smart ” Living E nvironment provides benefits for the peopl e living in the city such as 
free public Wifi, access to e - health, access to smart building services and access to e -
education solutions  (Kondepud et al., 2016) .  
• A “Smart ” Economy promotes the use of  electronic business processes in the cit y such as 
e-banking, e -shopping , and e-auction  (Kondepud et al., 2016) .  
SMART CITY IMPLEMENTATION IN CAPE TOWN  
Cape Town has often declared that it aims to be a more competitive city with rapid economic growth 
and ec onomic development (Anthopoulos  Fitsilis , 2013; Maumbe, Owei, & Alexander, 2008). Urban 
development is a priority in Cape Town, as the city continuously receives flocks of  South Africans from rural areas and non -south Africans looking for employment and accommodation (Odendaal, Smart Cities and Privacy Concerns  
58 2006). E-governme nt is one the main focus points of  Cape Town ’s smart city strategies (Lourie, 
2017). Another focus area in Cape Town ’s smart city agenda is to provide social and economic deve l-
opment to its citizens by improving ICT skills (Lourie, 2017).  
Cape Town has started to use more technology in its day -to-day management (Volkwyn, 2017). In 
particular, smart metering is being used for electricity and water in 65% of  the city ’s large  administr a-
tive buildings (Baud , Scott, Pfeffer, Sydenstricker -Neto, & Denis , 2015) . In the past, Cape Town has 
also introduced smart city projects such as the SMART Cape Access (Khati, 2013). The aim  of  the 
SMART Cape Access Projects was to provide Cape Town citizens with free access to technology 
(Valentine, 2004). The project was star ted in July 2002 and resulted in the installation of  36 Internet 
enabled computers in six public libraries in poorer  areas across the city (Valentine, 2004).  
More recently, Cape Town city management has rolled out public Wi -Fi in many areas around the cit y 
and actively endeavoured  to improve the city ’s broadband infrastructure  in order to reduce  the d igital 
divide (Volkwyn, 2017). According to Volkwyn (2017), in order to m ake Cape Town “Smarter ” there 
has also been an increase in the usa ge of  Closed -Circuit Television ( CCTV ) cameras in the city. In 
particular, city management has installed 560 cameras in and around the city in order to make the city 
safer (Volkwyn, 2017).  
Reports on smart city projects in Cape Town often  omit  information on privacy concerns of  the cit i-
zens (Smit, Makanga, Lance , & de Vries, 2009). One possible reason for this omission is that smart 
city initiatives often overshadow the privacy concerns that these projects may bring about (van Z o-
onen, 2016).  
PR IVACY CONCERNS IN SMART CITIES  
In a city that relies on smart technologies, everyday activities performed by people  leave trails of data 
on their interests, h abits, and intentions (Acquisti et al., 2016). Research shows that people around 
the world are unknowingly constantly  revealing information about themselves to commercial entities, 
governments , and sometimes to hackers  (Acquisti  et al., 2016). However, studies show that what data 
is deemed as private and sensitive varies from person to person, based on one ’s own cultural and s o-
cietal def inition of  privacy (Alashoor, Aryal , & Kenny,  2016; Taddicken, 2014).  
When individuals have higher privacy concerns , they will more likely want to protect their data and 
are less likely to disclose their information to entities that they do not trust (Beuker, 2016). Nonethe-
less, several research findings also show that , despite the possible privacy concerns in smart cities , 
these are often overshadowed by the possible benefits of the data collected (van Zoonen, 2016). 
These findings are in line with the “The Price of  C onvenience (PoC)”  theory (Ng -Kruelle,  Swatman, 
Rebne , & Hampe,  2002) which states that most people are w illing to forgo their privacy concerns and 
privacy rights for the conveniences received in return (Hann, Hui, Lee , & Png , 2007).  
PR IVACY CONCERNS IN SOUTH AFRICA  
Threats related to the leakage of  personal information of  citizens in South Africa may not be com-
mon but still occur. Olinger , Britz, and Olivier  (2007) write that , in June 2004, it was reported by se v-
eral South African newspapers that “the South African Post office would sell the personal infor-
mation of  the registered citizens contained in its National Address Database (NAD) ” (p. 32). The 
personal information compromised of  data such as the individual ’s name, identity number, home 
address, and telephone numbers that were taken from the Ministry of  Home affairs in South Africa 
(Olinger et al., 2007). Even though there are legal protections in South Africa against the misuse of 
personal information by someone else, illegal interceptions of  electronic communication by v arious 
people and institutions in South Africa still occur (Harris , Goodman, & Traynor , 2013). In order to 
specifically look at the privacy concerns of  citizens in an African city in relation to smart city impl e-
mentation, Backhouse (2015) states that futur e empirical studies are needed to unpack the various 
nuances of  smart city agendas in the African context.   Tshiani & Tanner  
59 PR IVACY CONCERNS IN AFRICA  
Research has shown that the widely acknowledged and practiced African philosophy of  Ubuntu has 
greatly influenced the pe rception s around  privacy in Africa in terms of  values and social thinking 
(Anteneh, Belanger, Borena , & Ejigu, 2015) . The philosophy identifies “personhood ”, which is the 
rights afforded to a person, as being determined not only by the individual person bu t largely by the 
community he or she lives in (Muyia & Nafukho, 2017) . Ubuntu values  initiatives and actions that 
will collectively benefit the community even more than the rights of  the individual  (Makulilo, 2015) . 
In Africa , it can thus be perceived that privacy is determined by the collective society as opposed to 
being determined by one ’s own personal beliefs  (Borena, Belanger , & Egigu, 2015) , which is in co n-
tradiction with current western values when it comes to the usage o f  technologies (Borena et al., 
2015) . It is said that the concept of  privacy and the concept of  an individual being self -autonomous 
is a western concept that has no roots in the African culture (Makulilo, 2015) . 
By virtue of  the fact that it is a generally accepted theory that Africans live in and have a collectivist culture (Harris  et al. , 2013) , it is also theoris ed that Africans put no value on digital privacy (Olinger  
et al., 2007) . However, Makulilo (2015 ) notes that this assumption is not necessarily true , and it does 
not mean that because of the collectivist culture in Africa, there is a lack of understanding and value of  privacy in Africa n countries. Makulilo (2015) hypothesis ed that the desire for African countries to 
engage in the global e -Commerce market, will force many African governments and people to rec on-
sider their ideas of  privacy.  
THE MULTIDIMENSIONALITY OF PR IVACY CONCERNS IN SMART CITIES  
Research shows that people ’s informational privacy conce rns are affected by not only personal ps y-
chological factors, bu t also external influences (Hsu  & Shih, 2009). Consensus in exi sting research 
indicates that there are four main factors that influence informational privacy concerns . These are 
Perceived Benef its, Type of  Data Collected, Awareness , and Perceived Control.  
• Perceived Benefits: Research shows that , for most individuals, if  they perceive more benefits 
than risks, they are then willing to accept the risks and thereupon disclose informa tion. 
Beuker (2016) and Barth and  de Jong (2017) state that , even though people may claim to va l-
ue their informational privacy , in truth , once they estimate the benefits from the information 
disclosure, personal information can then be traded. In line with the t heory o f “The Price of  
Convenience (PoC) ”, it is often found that the calculated value of  the benefits often ou t-
weighs the estimated costs of  infor mation disclosure (Culnan & Bies , 2003; Olivero & Lunt , 
2004).  
• Type of  Data Collected: According to research, privac y concerns are often determined by the 
type of  information that is being disclosed. Van Zoonen (2016) states that most people co n-
sider certain data type s as more personal than others, and what people deem as personal i n-
formation is not always consistent and is dependent on individuals ’ own definition. Genera l-
ly speaking, the types of  information can be categorised in two groups : personal information 
and impersonal information (van Zoonen, 2016). Impersonal information includes data such as gender, languages  spoken , and home town while personal information contains data such 
as profile pictures, emails, phone numbers , and personal views/preferences (Beuker, 2016).  
Research shows that many people believe and fear  that snippets of  personal information can 
easily be combined into highly personal consumer profiles (Harri s et al., 20 13; Tene & Jules , 
2013). Impersonal data , on the other ha nd, is likely to illicit low levels of  privacy concerns as 
this data tends to reveal nothing about individual people (van Zoone n, 2016).  
• Awareness: Uncertainties on how  personal information is collected, used , and shared result in 
high levels of  privacy concerns (Beldad, 2011). An individual’ s decisions of  whether or not 
to share personal data in a particular environment often depends on an awareness and eval u-
ation of  the information supplied about the privacy policies implemented in that particular Smart Cities and Privacy Concerns  
60 environment (Beldad, 2011). According to Dinev and Hart (2014), most people need to have 
an awareness of  the risks involved before making a decision.  
Uncertainties often stem from environments that are ambi guous and complex (Dinev & 
Hart, 2014). Research shows that peoples ’ uncertainties regarding the usage and the pr o-
cessing of  their personal information often triggers feeling of  information privacy viol a-
tions, which could lead them to a disengage from the environment or cause disruptions in 
the environment (Wel tevrede , 2011). Being aware of  the me thods and technologies used in 
the data collection of  one ’s personal information is also another factor that influences priv a-
cy concerns (van Zoonen, 2016).  
• Perceived Control: According to Beldad (2011), most people tend to favour the ability to filter 
the flow of  their personal data regardless of the environment they are in. Beldad (2011) fu r-
ther theorises that when people have control of  how their personal information is  collected, 
used and shared, this  lower s their privacy concerns. Several studies  have identified that an i n-
dividual having a perception of  control over their personal  data is an important factor in e n-
couraging people to partake in smart city initiatives (Stewart  & Segars , 2002). Control over 
one’s personal information can be exercised in tw o ways : before and after the information is 
disclosed (Beldad, 2011). Moreover, c ontrol over one ’s personal information can be achieved 
through various means such as choice, consent, access to the data , and the ability to provide 
correct ion of  the data (Be ldad, 2011).  
DIGITAL NATIVES IN CAPE TOWN  
Research shows that in the western world it is often perceived that because digital natives grew up with technology, the way they think, behave , and act is shaped by digital technologies (Gu, Z hu, & 
Zuo 2013; Hoffmann , Lutz, & Meckel,  2014). Identifying digital natives in South Africa and other 
developing countries is not as easy as it is in the western world due to vast wealth gaps in many de-
veloping countries (Thinyane, 2010). A digital native in South  Africa was born in a time where there 
was an increase in the usage of  technologies in the world, but because of  their economic background 
and racial discrimination, they might not exhibit the same technological proficiencies and inclinations 
as those of  digital natives in western world (Thinyane, 2010). The legacy of  Apartheid in South Afr i-
ca also had an impact on the uptake of  technology by people who fit in the age group of  the world ’s 
digital natives (Thinyane, 2010). Many of South Africa ’s digital nati ves still do not have access to the 
technologies that were made popu lar when they were born (Maumbe  et al., 2008). Understanding the 
patterns of access and use of  technology by South African digital natives is essential in to hypothe-sise and u nderstand  their privacy concerns (Thinyane, 2010).  
Research shows that age influences the behaviour  and perceptions of  a user of  technology. Brown 
and Czerniewicz (2010) argue that this view is not true in the South African context. Brown and 
Czerniewicz (2010, p.48) agree with Thinyane (2010) in arguing that in South Africa “age is not a 
determining factor in students ’ digital lives; rather, their familiarity (awareness) and experience (exp o-
sure) using ICTs is more relevant ”. In South Africa, those who demonstrate dig ital native attribut es 
are an elite minority (Brown  & Czerniewicz, 2010). The digital native population in South Africa co n-
sists of  a varied group that has a wide variety of  information technology  competences (Thinyane, 
2010). However , research shows that although in the African region only one in ten young people 
may be digital natives, it is these young people who are often their nation ’s drivers in terms of using 
the Internet and technologies (International Telecommunication Union, 2013).  
SUMMARY OF THE LITERATURE  
The literature review found that there is a growing trend of  incorporating smart city initiatives in cities all around the world. Although smart city initiatives have the potential to bring various benefits, 
literature shows that  these benefit can sometimes be overshadowed by security and privacy concerns. Tshiani & Tanner  
61 In the African context, these privacy and security concerns differ from those of  the western world 
due to differences in culture, economic capabilities , and access to technologi es. Cape Town is cur-
rently involved in several  smart city projects . Therefore,  in order to encourage  participation in these 
smart city initiatives , privacy concerns need to be investigated .  
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK  & HYPOTHESES  
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND CONS TRUCTS  
As discussed in the previous section, the main factors that might influence the privacy concerns of  people living in smart cities are Perceived Control, Awareness, Perceived Benefits , and Type of  Data 
Collected. The awareness construct was split in two so as to separately investigate the citizens ’ need 
for awareness of  practices and policies and their actual awareness of  methods and technologies used to collect data. A summary of  these factors are provided in Table 1.  
Table 1. Factors impacting privacy concerns in smart cities  
Constructs  Description  
Perceived Control  The extent to which citizens perceive that they have control over how their 
personal information is collected and if  they have an option to opt- out of  
the data collection process (Stewart & Segars, 2002) . 
Awareness  of  data 
collection  This construct relates to an awareness of  the methods and technologies that 
are used to gather/collect data in a smart city (Stewart & Segars, 2002) . 
Need for awar e-
ness The extent to which citizens need to be aware of  smart city ’s privacy pra c-
tices and polices – in terms of  rules determining access of  the data ( Beldad, 
2011). 
Perceived benefits  The perceived benefits and conveniences received in return for granting 
access to personal data  (Ng-Kruelle et al., 2002) . 
Type of  data co l-
lected  The perceived nature of  the data that is collected  (Ng-Kruelle et al. , 2002).  
 
The framework that was used in this study is shown in Figure 1. The dependent variable is the levels 
of  privacy concerns of  citizens living in the smart city of  Cape Town. The independent variable s 
were summaris ed in Table 1.

62 HYPOTHESIS  
The hypotheses derived for the study are:  
H1: The more digital natives perceive to receive benefits from providing personal data to the smart 
city of  Cape Town, the lower their privacy concerns.  
H2: The more impersonal  the data being collected by the smart city of  Cape Town  is, the lowe r the 
privacy concerns of  the digital natives.  
H3: The more digital natives perceive to have control on the data collected about them by the smart 
city of  Cape Town, the lower their privacy concerns  
H4: The more the digital natives are aware of  how their personal data is collected by the smart city 
of  Cape Town, the lower their privacy concerns  
H5: The higher the need to  be aware of  the security measures put in place during the collection and 
storage of  their personal information by the smart ci ty of  Cape Town, the higher the  privacy co n-
cerns of  the digital natives  
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY  
RESEARCH APPROACH  AND PHILOSOPHY  
The study adopted a positivist philosophy as the data to be collected is objectively observable and 
quantifiable. In particular, the study involves finding a cause and effect type of  relation . A deductive 
approach to theory was also chosen as positivists and quantitative studies are usually deductive in  
nature ( Greener & Martelli, 2014). The research strategy was quantitative and involved the  collection 
of  numerical data for the purpose of  getting precise measurements which can then be converted into useable statistics (Bhattacherjee, 2012).  
Since the aim of  this study was to identify the current privacy concerns of  a certai n group of  people 
in Cape Town, a cross - sectional approach was best suited as it provides a present -day “ snapsh ot” of  
a point of  view ( Greener & Martelli, 2014 ). 
RESEARCH METHODS  
Instrument  
An online survey questionnaire of  closed questions  was the chosen research instrume nt in this study. 
An online questionnaire was chosen as it provided anonymous access to groups and individuals who would otherwise be difficult to reach in a short amount of  time and in large numbers through other channels. Online surveys also kept the cos ts for the study to a minimum (Wright, 2005).  
In addition to demographics questions, the survey consisted of  questions that correspond to each of  
the constructs in the research framework , namely , Perceived benefits, Type of  data collected, Pe r-
ceived Contro l, Awareness  of  Data Collection, Need for Awareness , and Levels of  Privacy Concerns.  
A Likert scale was used to allow the respondents to indicate their opinions, attitudes , or feeling s 
about a particular issue. A Likert scale with an odd number of  options was used. In particular, a 5 
point Likert scale of  1 =Strongly disagree, 2 =Disagree, 3 = Both Agree and Disagree, 4 =Agree,  
5 = Strongly agree was used.   
In order to protect the identity and views of the resear ch population used, all surveys responses were 
anonymous. Importance was put in maintaining the confidentiality of  the data collected and pr o-
duced in this research. The codes of ethics prescribed by the University of  Cape Town were followed 
while researchi ng was being done.  Tshiani & Tanner  
63 The online survey questionnaire was sent with a brief  introduction note, stating the purpose of  the 
study and a brief  description of  the study. The introductory note stated that participation in the r e-
search was voluntary and participants could opt out of  the survey questionnaire at any time.  
Participant r ecruitment  
In developed countries, people born in the late 1980s and early 1990s are considered to be digital natives as they are presumed to have grown up in the age of  technology (Boy d, 2013). However, due 
to large wealth inequalities within the South African population, there exist differences in exposure to 
technologies wi thin this age group (Triegaardt, 2009). Hence, the research population of  this study 
has been limited to Cape Tow n citizens born in the late 1980s and early 1990s but who also grew up 
with an exposure and awareness of  the popular technologies. Participants were allowed to partake in the survey if  their response to the following question was “yes”: “Did you ha ve acces s to a computer 
and/or I nternet during your primary school years (access of  this can come from anywhere and is not 
limited to home access)? ”  
A combination of  non- probability convenience sampling and Judgmental sampling (purposive sa m-
pling) approach was us ed. Convenience sampling selects cases based on their availability and willin g-
ness to participate  in the study ( Palinkas  et al., 2015). A Judgment sampling approach was used as the 
researchers had to rely on logic and judgment to pick  the sample population ( Palinkas  et al., 2015). 
The sample size was that of  100 responses.  
The survey questionnaire was distributed using the online survey tool Qualtrics. The link to the Qua l-
trics questionnaire was sent via email and on social media in order to target the required population. The emails were sent to mostly university students i n the Cape Town as it can be assumed that a large 
number of  digital natives can be found on a university campus. The universities were randomly ch o-
sen. 
Data analysis methods  
Once the data gathering period was concluded the data was extracted from Qualtrics  and imported 
into the statistical analysis software Statistica for basic statistics tests that summarised and described 
the characteristics of  the data gathered. Before being imported, the data was cle aned and coded in 
Excel in order to ensure it was free  of  errors and  was analys able. 
Reliability and item analysis was don e using Cronbach’ s alpha tests.  The relationships between the 
independent and dependent variables were found using Spearman Rank Order correlation analysis 
and multiple regression analysis tests.  
DATA ANALYSIS  
The findings are presented in this section . First,  the reliability  and consi stency of  the model was  test-
ed through the C ronbach’ s Alpha test. The data wa s then tested for normality . A d escriptive tests 
analysis of  the data was also conducted . The hypotheses were tested using correlation and multiple 
regression tests based on the n ormality of the dat a. Correlation analysis measured  the strength of  the 
relationships between variab les whereas regression estimated  what the relati onship wa s (Saunders, 
Lewis, & Thornhill, 2009).  
RELIABILITY TESTING  
Cronbach’ s alpha tests were performed for each of  the constructs (i.e. , Perceived Benefits, Types of  
Data Collected, Awareness and Perceived Control) and were used to measure the internal consistency 
of  responses pertaining to each construct (Bhattacherjee, 2012).  A Cronbach’ s alpha of  at leas t 0.6 is 
normally required (Bhattacherjee, 2012). Initial results of the Cronbach ’s Alpha test are shown in 
Table 2.  Smart Cities and Privacy Concerns  
64 Table  2. Cronbach ’s Alpha Reliability Test Results  
Construct  Cronbach ’s alpha  
Perceived Benefits  0.45 
Awareness  0.81 
Types of  data collected  -0.46 
Perceived Control  0.72 
 
As can be seen in Table 2, the Cronbach’ s Alpha values for the Awareness and Perceived Control 
constructs were acceptable (i.e. , > 0.6). This was not the case for the Perceived Benefits and Types of  
Data Collected constructs. Further investigations into the results for the Perceived Benefits co n-
struct, showed that the second question on benefits  (I consider better distribution of  city resources such as 
water, and electricity a benefit of  living in a smart city ) had to be omitted so that the Cronbach’ s alpha for 
that cons truct could increase to 0.58  (approx. 0.6).  
The negative Cronbach’ s Alpha result for the Types of  Data Collected construct was due to having 
two similar questions which were inversely formulated:  
1. I do not mind it when Cape Town uses data that specifically identifies me in the running of  the city,  
and  
2. I do not mind it when Cape Town uses data about me if  it does not specifically identify me (impersonal da-ta/unidentifiable data).  
The first question was omitted resulting in a Cro nbach ’s Alpha result of  0.6  for the construct.  
An overall instrument ’s reliability was then tested to assure the reliability and consistency of  the i n-
strument as a whole and produce d a Cronbach ’s Alpha of  0.9  and a sta ndardis ed alpha value of  0.9 . 
Table 3 shows the final results of  the Cronbach ’s Alpha tests performed for each construct and for 
the overall instrument’ s reliability after relevant questions were removed from the model.  
Table 3 . Fina l Cronbach ’s Alpha Reliability T est Results

Awareness  0.9 
Types of  data collected  0.6 
Perceived Control  0.7 
Overall instrument ’s reliability  0.8 
TEST FOR CONSTRUCT NORMALITY AND DISTRIBUTION  
Each construct was tested for normality using the Shapiro- Wilk’s (SW  ) and Kolmogorov -Smirnov. 
With a p – value < 0.001, the SW test is stat istically significant for the test items in the constructs. 
Consequently, all the constructs are non -normally distributed.  
DESCRIPTIVE TESTS  
63% of  the participants were female, 34% were male , and 3% chose not to disclose their gender. In 
addition, t he par ticipants consisted of  digital natives from Cape Town born between 1985 and 1995. 
Most of  the participants (77%) were b orn between 1991 and 1995 and 23 % between 1985 and 1990.  Tshiani & Tanner  
65 HYPOTHESES TESTING  
Since the objective of  this study is to assess the relationship between the independent variables Pe r-
ceived Benefits, Types of  Data Collected, Awareness , and Perceived Control on the dependent vari a-
ble (i.e. , Level of  Privacy Concerns), Spearman correlation tests were first conducted. The value o b-
tained fr om the Spearman correlation test is called the correlation coefficient (Saunders , Lewis,  & 
Thornhill , 2009). A positive correlation coefficient indicates a positive relationship between the two 
variables, while negative correlation coefficients indicate a negative relationship (Saunders et al., 
2009). The closer the Spearman value is to ±1 the stronger the monotonic relationship between the 
variables  (Saunders  et al., 2009). The Spearman correlation test is useful for this study as it can be 
used on data th at comes from Likert Scale variables and can be used for data t hat is non -parametric 
(Saunders  et al., 2009).  
Multiple regression analysis was also employed. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine 
the probability of  the relationship between each individual independent variables and the dependent 
variable “Levels of  Privacy Concerns ” occurring by chance (Sa unders et al. , 2009).  
H1: The more digital natives perceive to receive benefits from providing personal 
data to the smart city of  Cape Town, the lower their privacy concerns.  
As can be seen in Table 4 , no support can be found for Hypothesis 1 as there is no statistically signi f-
icant negative correlation between the Level of  P rivacy Concerns of  Cape Town smart citizens and 
the two of  the questions related to Perceived Benefits (Q3: 0.43, Q4: 0.38 ). Only Question 1 on Pe r-
ceived Benefit has a negative correlation with Level of  Privacy Concern (Q1: -0.23).

Marked correlations are significant at

Variable  Benefit Q1  Benefit Q 3 Benefit Q4  
Level of  Privacy Concern  - 0.23 0.43 0.38 
 
Moreover, the results of  multiple regression analysis r evealed an R value of  0.50 . The degree of  co r-
relation is therefore moderate , and only 25.5% of  the total variation in the dependent variable Levels 
of  Privacy Concerns can be explained by the independent variable Perceived Benefits. Hence, the 
study indicates that Perceived B enefits does not significantly influence the levels of  p rivacy concerns 
of  digital natives living in the smart city of  Cape Town.  
This result is not in line with the findings of  other studies such as those in the van Zoonen (2016) 
study on informational privacy concerns. These results are also in contrast to the theory concepts of  
“Price of  Convenience (POC) ” talked about in the literature review of this paper.   
H2: The more impersonal  the data being co llected by the smart City of  Cape Town, 
the lower the privacy concerns of  the digital natives  
As can be seen i n Table 5 , there is a signification negative correlation between the Type of  Data Co l-
lected and the Level of  Privacy Concerns in suppo rt of  Hypothesis 2(Q1: -0.41) at 95% confidence 
level.

The results of  the regression analysis also revealed that the more impersonal data is collected by the 
Smart City of  Cape Town, the lower the privacy concerns of  the digital na tives. An R value of  -0.39 
was obtained indicating that the association is inversely correlated. The “types of  data collecte d” 
construct shows a statistically significant correlation of  a confidence level of  0.00007 (>99%).  
The research findings of  this study therefore indicate that the more digital natives felt that imperso n-
al data was being collected by the smart City of Cape  Town, the lower their privacy concerns. This is 
consistent with research findings from the van Zoonen (2016) study.  
H3: The more control digital natives perceive to have control on the data collected 
about them by the smart city of  Cape Town, the lower their privacy concerns  
The results from Table 6  indicate that no support can be found for Hypothesis 3 as there is no stati s-
tically significant negative correlation between the Level of  Privacy Concerns of  Cape Town digital 
natives and three of  the questions  related to Perceived Control (Q2: 0.06, Q3: 0.86, Q4: 0.86 ). Only 
Question 1 on Perceived Control has a negative correlation with Level of  Privacy Concern (Q1: -
0.01).

Variable  Control Q1  Control Q2  Control Q3  Control Q4  
Level of  Privacy Co n-
cern -0.01 0.06 0.86 0.86 
 The results of  the regression analysis also indicate that the variable Perceived Control does not si g-
nificantly influence the levels of  privacy concerns. In par ticular, a R value of  0.10  and a positive 
B coefficie nt of  2.41  was obtained.  
Hence, the findings indicate that there is no st atistically significant negative correlation between Pe r-
ceived Control and the level of  privacy concerns of  digital natives living in the smart City of  Cape 
Town. This result is different from those of  other international studies (e.g. , Beldad (2011). This  dif-
ference might be explained by the practiced  African philosophy of  Ubuntu. Ubuntu places the rights 
afforded to a person as being determined not only by the individual person but largely by the co m-
munity he or she lives in. This entices an individual to  not put an importance on having control of  
what information is known about them or how it is used (Anteneh et al. , 2015).  Tshiani & Tanner  
67 H4: The more the digital natives are aware of  how their personal data is collected by the 
smart city of  Cape Town, the lower their pr ivacy concerns  
Table 7  indicates that no support can be found for Hypothesis 4 as there is no statistically significant 
negative correlation between the Level of  Privacy Concerns of  Cape Town digital natives and all of  
the questions related to awareness of  the method of  data collection (Q1: 0.004 , Q2: 0.020 , Q3: 0.86 ).

Marked correlations are significant at p <.05000  
Variable  Awareness Method Q1  Awareness Method Q2  
Level of  Privacy Co n-
cern 0.004  0.02 
 
The results of  the regression analysis also indicate that the Awareness of  Data Collection Method 
does not significantly influence the levels of  privacy concerns. In particular, a R value of  0. 09 and a 
positive B  coefficient of  2.08 was obtained.  
Results from the test carried out on this hypothesis , therefore , indicate that the test item does not 
show a statistically significant correlation to the dependent variable of  Levels of  Privacy Concerns of  digital natives living in the smart City of  Cape Town. This result is different from those of  intern a-
tional studies (e.g. , Beldad (2011)) and could possibly also be explained by th e African philosophy of  
Ubuntu. In the widely adopted African philosophy of  Ubuntu, whether or not an individual has an 
awareness of  what rights pertain to them as a person does not influence the actual rights that are 
afforded to them as an individual (An tenehet al., 2015).  
H5: The higher the need to be aware of  the security measures put in place during the colle c-
tion and storage of  their personal information by the smart city of  Cape Town, the higher 
their privacy concerns of  the digital natives  
As shown  in Table 8 , support could be found for Hypothesis at a 95% confidence level. The table 
shows that there is a statistically significant positive correlation between the Level of  Privacy Co n-
cerns of  Cape Town digital natives and all of the questions related to the need to be awareness of  
security measures put in place during data collection (Q1: 0.22, Q2: 0.72).

Marked correlations are significant at p <.05000  
Variable  Awareness Security Q1  Awareness Security Q2  
Level of  Privacy Concern  0.22 0.72 
 The results of  the regression analysis also revealed that the digital natives ’ need to be aware of  the 
security measures positively significantly correlates to the levels of  privacy concerns of  living in a smart city at a confidence level of  87%.  In particular, an R value of  0 .32 and a positive B value of  
1.98 were obtained.  Smart Cities and Privacy Concerns  
68 Since the correlation between the dependent and independent variables is a positive one, the more 
the respondents placed an importance on knowing the security measures put in place in the colle c-
tion and storage of  data collected about them, the higher thei r privacy concerns. This is in line with 
other international studies (e.g. , Stewart & Segars, 2002).  
DISCUSSION  
The study was conducted using a positivist and quantitative approach and five hypotheses were tes t-
ed. Of  these five hypotheses, only two were sh own to have statistical significance as shown in T a-
ble 9.  
The findings reveal that the more impersonal data is collected by the Smart City of  Cape Town, the 
lower the privacy concerns of  the digital natives. This is in line with van Zoonen (2016) who also 
found that the collection of  impersonal data illicit s low levels of  privacy concerns, given the type of  
data that is being collected (e.g. , gender, language spoken etc.).   
The findings also show that the digital natives  of  Cape Town  have higher privacy c oncerns when 
their need to be aware of  the security measure put in place by the city is high.  This is in line with past 
studies which also found that people ’s uncertainties regarding how their personal data is used and 
processed often triggers feeling of  i nformation priva cy violations (Weltevrede , 2011).  
Table 9. Hypotheses Results  
Hypothesis  Result  
H1: The more digital natives perceive to receive benefits from providing personal 
data to the smart city of  Cape Town, the lower their privacy concerns.  
 Rejected  
H2: The more impersonal  the data being collected by the smart city of  Cape 
Town, the lower the privacy concerns of  the digital natives.  
 Accepted  
H3: The more control digital natives perceive to have control on the data collec t-
ed about them by t he smart city of  Cape Town, the lower their privacy concerns  
 Rejected  
H4: The more the digital natives are aware of  how their personal data is collected 
by the smart city of  Cape Town, the lower their privacy concerns  
 Rejected  
H5: The higher the need to be aware of  the security measures put in place during 
the collection and storage of  their personal information by the smart city of  Cape 
Town, the higher their privacy concerns of  the digital natives  
 Accepted  
 In the study Hypothesis 1 was rejected. This is not in line with past studies which found that people 
are willing to accept risks and disclose information when they perceive more benefits than risks in doing so (Beuker, 2016; Barth & de Jong, 2017). Hypothese s 3 and 4 were  also re jected, in contrast to 
what has been said in literature (Beldad, 2011; Stewart  & Segars , 2002).  
Possible reasons as to why these hypotheses were rejected might relate to the philosophy of  Ubuntu 
and other cultural beliefs that have rendered privacy concerns not as crucial or central to one ’s life in 
Africa, as compared to Western Cultures  (Borena et al., 2015) . Furthermore , it has been stated in li t-
erature that  what data is deemed as private and sensitive varies from person to person, based on one ’s 
own cultural and societal definition of  privacy (Alashoor  et al., 2016; Taddicken, 2014).  
It is important to understand the privacy concerns of  the digital natives because, in a world that is 
more and more driven by sophisticated technologies, it can be ar gued that these digital natives are 
best able to navigate and use these technologies in the future. Cities need the technologically wise and Tshiani & Tanner  
69 experienced to define, discuss , and evaluate the impact of different technologies in our societies in 
terms of  ethi cs and liabilities (Prensky, 2009). In addition, cities should also consider the concerns of 
digital natives because recent history has shown that digital natives have been known to use their 
technological abilities to drive movements and unrest for change  in the cities, which has now been 
coined as digital activism (Weltevrede, 2011).  
This study contributes to scientific literature by detailing the impact of  specific factors on the privacy 
concerns of  citizens living in an African city. For city law makers in Cape Town, this study has pract i-
cal implications as it provides information on relevant focus areas on which the law makers could pay attention to, with the aim to encouraging and appeasing any apprehensions from its citizens towards 
smart city i mplementations.  
While these study ’s findings add to the body of  knowledge, there were , however , limitations in the 
findings. Most of the participants in the study were university students, and a wider net should have 
been cast on finding participants. The sample size in future similar studies should be bigger. Income 
bracket, work industry, race, and gender are some of  the attributes which were not taken into consi d-
eration in this study and should be taken into consideration in future similar studies.  
CONCL USION  
Past studies indicate that there are four main factors that influence the privacy concerns of  citizens living in smart cities. These factors are Awareness, Perceived Benefits, Types of  Data Collected , and 
Perceived Control. However, these studies hav e mostly been conducted in developed countries and 
little is known about their impact in emerging smart cities in developing countries . This study invest i-
gated the impact of  Perceived Benefits, Type of  Data Collected, Perceived Control , and Awareness 
on the Level of  Privacy Concerns of  digital natives living in Cape Town, South Africa.  
Only two of  the five hypotheses were shown to have statistical significance. For the purpose of  del v-
ing deeper into the reasons  why some of  the hypotheses could not be prove n, it would be useful to 
make use of  open ended questions . The open ended questions could be implemented through a 
mixed method  research approach that would allow for an in -depth exploration on how the independ-
ent variables in this study influence the depe ndent variable. The use of  open ended questions in a 
qualitative study could also be used to further identify other factors that might influence privacy co n-
cerns of  digital natives living in the smart city of  Cape Town.

 A smart city is a city that incorporates the use of  Information communication technologies (ICT) and 
the internet of  things, in the managing and monitoring of  city resources. A smart can use several tec h-
nologies such as surveillance cameras and smart energy consumption meters in the running of  the city. 
The concept of  smart cities is used in various city management areas such as public safety, infrastru c-
ture design and infrastructure monitoring.  
Data is constantly being produced and consumed in smart cities, data such as vehicle movements, vis i-
tor movements, energy consumption, neighbourhood sentiments and crowd control data. Data from different sources in smart cities is often integrated together in the aim of  gaining a picture o f  the city’s 
status in terms of  safety, economic vitality and in terms of  city resources usage.  Smart Cities and Privacy Concerns
