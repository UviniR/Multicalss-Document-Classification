About ID4D
The World Bank Group’s Identi fication for Development (ID4D) initiative uses global knowledge and 
expertise across sectors to help countries realize the transformational potential of digital identification 
systems to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. It operates across the World Bank Group with 
global practices and units working on digital development, social protection, health, financial inclusion, 
governance, gende r, legal, among others.
The mission of ID4D is to enable all people to access services and exercise their rights, by increasing 
the number of people who have an official form of identification. ID4D makes this happen through its 
three pillars of work: thought leadership and analytics to generate evidence and fill knowledge gaps; 
global platforms and convening to amplify good practices, collaborate and raise awareness; and country 
and regional engagement to provide financial and technical assistance for the implementation of robust, 
inclusive and responsible digital identifi cation systems that are integrated with civil registration.
The work of ID4D is made possible through support from the World Bank Group, the Bill & Melinda 
Gates Foundation, the UK Government, the Australian Government and the Omidyar Network.

I. Introduction
Proof of identity is vital in modern society. Individuals need identity documents to participate in many 
aspects of civil, political, and economic life. These include obtaining a job in the formal sector, opening a bank account, borrowing from a financial institution, and owning a property or a business in addition to traveling, voting, and gaining access to health and social welfare services. For women and girls, legal identity is a stepping stone to empowerment, agency, and freedom of movement. Hence, it is a vital enabler of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. However, many women and girls do not have access to legal identity. Globally, it is estimated that 1 billion people are unable to prove their identity, and millions more have forms of identification that cannot be reliably verified or authenticated (World Bank 2015). This gap disproportionately affects women and girls, as several low-income countries have a gender gap in access to ID (figure 1).

The importance of legal identity starts at birth, as without birth registration and certification, a child has no recognition before the law.
1 Birth registration is essential for a child’s acquisition of a name and nationality 
and an important foundation for child protection measures (UNICEF 2013). Globally, only 71 percent of 
children under the age of five are registered at birth, which drops to 56 percent in the poorest wealth 
quintile of the world (UNICEF 2017a). Obtaining a birth certificate is equally crucial. Birth certificates serve as ‘foundational documents’, which are necessary to obtain national IDs, passports, social security cards, or driver licenses. Furthermore, a birth certificate constitutes proof of age and is often a means to enforce 
laws designed to protect children, such as juvenile justice proceedings, child labor laws, minimum age of 
legal marriage laws, and laws prohibiting conscription of minors into the armed forces. A birth certificate 
may also be essential to avoid statelessness, as it provides information needed to prove entitlement to a nationality, such as place of birth and parents’ information (Apland et al. 2015; Dahan and Hanmer 2015; Hanmer and Elefante 2016; Save the Children 2013; UNICEF 2013; UNHCR 2017).94%

This paper explores how gender-based legal differences and nationality laws limit women’s ability to obtain 
identification for themselves, their children, and, in the case of nationality laws, their spouses too. It brings 
together data and analysis produced by agencies working on legal barriers that pertain to their mandates—
for example, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) on birth registration, the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on statelessness, and the evidence produced by the World Bank 
Group’s Women, Business and the Law and other legal sources. Its aim is to provide a comprehensive 
overview of the extent of gender-based legal barriers against women to ID and what is known about their 
impact on women, children, and excluded groups.
Legal barriers to ID for women are often the result of prevailing social norms. They demonstrate deep 
rooted assumptions about the appropriate role of women in society and entrench women’s inequality with 
men in this sphere. Legal barriers to nationality are similarly grounded in patriarchal views of the family as 
well as in historical approaches to nationality as a basis for loyalty to one’s state.2 Identifying and addressing 
the specific barriers that women face to access identity for themselves and their children is therefore both 
a human rights issue and a development issue. Policy responses to incentivize legal reform in this area are 
not only needed to reach the development target of ‘legal identity for all’ but are also needed to increase 
women’s empowerment, financial inclusion, and labor force participation, thus unlocking crucial growth 
potential (McKinsey Global Institute 2015).
We find that most countries do not explicitly prohibit women from applying for an ID or the associated 
foundational documentation for themselves or their children. Rather, in many countries, gender-based 
differences in laws and regulations make it more burdensome for a woman than a man to obtain an ID or 
the foundational documents needed to get one. This additional burden, when combined with other aspects 
of gender inequality that put women at a disadvantage (for example, lack of education, constraints to 
traveling far away from the home, limited access to cash or income, inability to use or access information 
and communication technology (ICT), and lack of household decision-making power), leads to the gender 
gap in ID access. This is a particular concern for women and children who may be at risk of statelessness, 
as will be discussed in detail in section II.d.Box 1. The right to legal identity within the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes the role of identification in development. 
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 16), “Promote inclusive, just and peaceful societies for sustainable 
development, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions 
at all levels” sets a series of targets that will measure progress towards attaining this goal. One such 
target is: “By 2030 provide legal identity for all, including birth registration” (Target 16.9). Besides 
constituting an important indicator of inclusiveness in its own right, achievement of this target has 
also been recognized as an enabler to the realization of other SDGs (Gelb and Dahan 2015).
To support the achievement of this SDG, a group of development partners, United Nations (UN) 
agencies, multilateral development banks, major nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and 
foundations have endorsed a common set of principles on identification for sustainable development 
that are fundamental to maximizing the benefits of identification for sustainable development. These 
principles encompass inclusion and the need to ensure universal access and accessibility:
  Ensuring universal coverage for individuals from birth to death free from discrimination
  Removing barriers to access and usage and disparities in the availability of information and 
technology

 I.  IntroductionThis paper is divided into two sections. The first section identifies the current legal and regulatory barriers 
affecting women’s access to IDs, passports, and birth registration and certification. It then turns to the 
impact of gender-discriminatory nationality laws on the risk of statelessness for women and their children 
and spouses. The second section explores recent initiatives and strategies that have been adopted to 
remove gender-based legal differences in access to national IDs, passports, and birth certificates as well 
as from nationality laws.Box 2. Definitions: Foundational and functional ID systems
There are two broad categories of ID systems: 
  Foundational identification systems  are created with the objective of providing general legal 
identification which may serve as the basis for a wide variety of purposes. Common examples 
include population registries and national ID cards.
  Functional identification systems  are created in response to a demand for a particular service 
or transaction such as voter IDs or tax IDs. These do not normally bestow legal identity.
Foundational and functional ID systems may be paper based or digital and may coexist within the 
same country.

Notes
1  Birth registration is the official recording in the civil registry of the occurrence and characteristics of births, in accordance with 
the legal requirements of a country. A birth certificate is a vital certified record that documents the birth of a child and constitutes 
proof of registration (UNICEF 2013) .
2  The principle of dependent nationality was applied in most states at the beginning of the twentieth century and required 
that a woman who married a foreigner automatically acquired the nationality of her husband upon marriage, based on the view that 
nationality would entail loyalty to one state only. This was normally accompanied by the loss of her own nationality. United Nations,

II. Gender-based legal barriers against 
women to identification
Gender-based legal barriers against women to obtaining identification exist when laws or regulations make 
access to identification more difficult or burdensome for women. These barriers are more common for 
married women, who often need to be accompanied by a male guardian, or provide additional information 
or documentation not required of married men, such as the name of the husband or the family booklet 
or marriage certificate when applying for identification. The World Bank’s Women, Business and the Law  
provides information on countries that place limitations on women’s ability to apply for identification. In 35 
countries, a married woman cannot apply for a passport through the same process as married men, and in 
11 countries married women cannot apply for an ID in the same way as married men. Only three countries 
apply the same restrictions to unmarried women (table 1).
Women also face legal barriers when trying to register the birth of their children and obtain birth certificates 
for them. For example, in some countries, the father is legally responsible for registering the birth of a child; 
in others, birth registration is contingent on the existence of a marital relationship between parents. We 
explore these limitations in more detail in the sections below.

 II. Gender-based legal barriers against women to identificationa) Barriers to obtaining national ID cards
Gender-based legal differences in accessing ID cards most commonly arise when women are required to 
obtain permission from a male guardian or to provide information or documentation not required of men. 
Requiring the presence of a male guardian is now uncommon for IDs. A stark exception to this is Saudi 
Arabia where a woman applying for an ID must be accompanied by a male guardian, typically the husband 
or father, and needs a male guardian’s signature, plus her passport or two women witnesses to prove her 
identity. These requirements are not mandated for men.3
Although requiring the presence of the male guardian is uncommon outside of Saudi Arabia, other countries 
still place explicit legal burdens on married women when applying for an ID. For example, in the Arab 
Republic of Egypt, while the ID card of a married woman must show the name of her husband, a man’s ID 
card only indicates his marital status.4 In Algeria,5 married women must include the name of their spouse 
on the national ID application form, while men are not required to do so.
Legal and social norms surrounding name change on marriage affect access to identification, and regulations 
may limit the choice that married women have regarding their legal identity upon marriage, divorce, or 
widowhood. When a spouse changes the last name upon marriage, evidence of a marriage contract is 
needed to obtain new ID documents with the married name. Similarly, on divorce or separation, those 
persons wanting to revert to their name at birth must produce documentary evidence. Such regulations 
affect women disproportionately, as large numbers of women change their names to that of their husband, 
while men almost never assume their wives’ names upon marriage (Goldin and Shim 2004; Thwaites 2013). 
Regulations can reenforce this norm by making it difficult for men to change their name on marriage. 
For instance, in the United States, in all but eight states, a man who wishes to alter his name on marriage 
must go through a lengthy and expensive legal process (Anthony 2010). Where women typically change 
their name on marriage, certificates of marriage and proof of divorce are commonly required for passport 
applications. Marriage certificates can also be required, although more rarely, for a national ID card, as 
evidenced in Benin, Cameroon, and Pakistan.6 Alternatively, there are few countries which avoid this burden 
as the default regime is for women to keep their own names upon marriage (Koffler 2015)—for example, 
Belgium,7 France,8 Greece,9 Italy,10 and the Canadian province of Quebec.11
Legal reforms have eliminated gender-based legal differences to accessing ID in many places. However, it 
can take time for new regulations to be implemented and women may remain at a disadvantage compared 
to men despite legal reform. For example, in Afghanistan, the tazkera  card is the primary identification 
document needed to access government services as well as to obtain employment in large parts of the 
private sector. A 2010 legal amendment eliminated the requirement for women to bring male witnesses to 
renew their tazkera  card.12 However, the application process varies depending on where the application is 
submitted, and in some regions, women are still asked to bring male witnesses (Samuel Hall and Norwegian 
Refugee Council 2016).
Even when no gender-based legal or regulatory differences exist, gender inequality can make it more 
difficult for women to comply with regulations governing access to ID cards compared to men. In Indonesia, 
surveys found that the cost of travel was a particularly binding constraint for poor rural women (Sumner 
2015). In Pakistan, the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) successfully designed and 
implemented a program to register women in areas where a long-standing culture of male chauvinism had 
prevented their registration in the past (Malik 2014).
Women in already disadvantaged groups can be disproportionately affected, as in the case of internally 
displaced persons (IDPs) in Afghanistan. Applications for tazkera  cards have to be submitted in the 
applicant’s place of origin or with central authorities in Kabul. When IDPs wish to apply for a tazkera  from 
their current place of residence, they must bring an official letter (Ariza) from the Population Registration 
Office in Kabul, explaining why they cannot obtain their tazkera  in their original home. Due to social norms 
that limit women’s mobility in Afghanistan and their interaction with officials in public spaces, travel to ACHIEVING UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO ID: GENDER-BASED LEGAL BARRIERS AGAINST WOMEN AND GOOD PRACTICE REFORMS6
Kabul is more difficult for women than men. As a result, data suggest that few female IDPs hold tazkera  
cards. For example, a 2016 survey fielded in Herat Province showed that only 21 percent of female IDPs 
surveyed held a tazkera , compared with 44 percent of host community women. More men in both groups 
held tazkeras : 87 percent of male IDPs and 94 percent of men in the host community (Samuel Hall and 
Norwegian Refugee Council 2016). In May 2018, the Government of Afghanistan launched Electronic 
National Identity Cards, known as e-tazkera , and put in place policies to tackle the low levels of tazkera  
card possession among women, including IDP women (Ahmad 2018).
b) Barriers to obtaining passports
Women face many barriers when applying for a passport, regardless of their marital status, although 
legal differences are more common for married women (see table 1). As with national IDs, requiring 
the presence of a male guardian is now uncommon. Reforms removing this requirement from passport 
application procedures were enacted in 2015 in Afghanistan and Iraq, two of the few remaining countries 
to have such restrictions in place. However, the written permission of a male guardian or husband is still 
required by several countries for a married woman to be issued a passport, including Bahrain,13 Gabon,14 
the Islamic Republic of Iran,15 and Saudi Arabia.16 In Gabon, a married woman must present permission 
from her husband and provide his name, nationality, and identity card when applying for a passport.17 In 
the Islamic Republic of Iran, permission to obtain a passport can also be provided by a woman’s “father, 
or another male relative,” however, “married women must receive written permission from their husbands 
before being allowed to leave the country.”18 Further, the social norm that married women should normally 
be accompanied by their husbands when they travel can be reflected in legal norms. For example, in 
Yemen, the law explicitly states that “if it is difficult to grant the wife a separate passport, she is added to 
her husband’s passport,” after evidence of the continuity of the marital relationship is provided.19 Similarly, 
in Sudan, a married woman may be inscribed in her husband’s passport rather than obtain her own.20
Where male presence or approval is not required, women are often still required to provide additional 
documentation or information to obtain a passport—similar to national IDs. In Jordan, married women 
need to provide a copy of a valid Jordanian family booklet and include the name and nationality of their 
husband on the application form. Unmarried women need to declare their marital status in the application 
form, a requirement that does not apply to men.21 In Yemen, a personal or family identity card is needed 
to apply for a passport.22 A married woman who wants to apply for a passport that is separate from 
her husband’s must provide the husband’s name, nationality, place, and date of birth.23 The additional 
information required is often the spouse’s name on the passport application form, which is a requirement 
for married women (but not for married men) in Algeria,24 Egypt,25 Jordan,26 Mali,27 Myanmar,28 Dominica,29 
and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. In Dominica,30 married women are required to provide the full name 
of their husband or former husband together with the place and date of marriage. In Saudi Arabia, all the 
following restrictions apply. Women must provide the father or husband’s family booklet to apply for a 
passport, and written consent of the husband or legal guardian is needed, along with proof of marriage 
or kinship.31 More specifically, married women who are applying for a separate passport must provide the 
name and national identification number of their husband on the application form. This requirement does 
not apply to married men.32 Unmarried women must provide the name and national identification number 
of their guardian on the application form. The guardian is also required to sign the form, affirming that 
the woman is allowed a separate passport.33 In St. Vincent and the Grenadines, married women must 
include the place and date of marriage, as well as the husband’s name, place and date of birth, and 
nationality in the application form. If the husband was born abroad, name, place, and date of birth of the 
husband’s parents must be provided. A married man may apply for a joint passport, but married women 
cannot use the joint passport to travel alone.34
In the past, legal regulations have been used to prevent or limit women from using their passports; however, 
this is now increasingly rare. In Saudi Arabia, a woman under 45 years requires a male guardian’s consent 7
 II. Gender-based legal barriers against women to identificationto travel abroad and a foreign woman married to a Saudi Arabian man needs permission from her husband 
to travel unless both partners sign a prenuptial agreement permitting the non-Saudi Arabian wife to travel 
without the husband’s permission. Government entities and male family members can ‘blacklist’ women 
and minor children, prohibiting their travel.35 Sometimes, patriarchal customs and practices create barriers 
to women’s ability to access and use passports. For example, in the United Arab Emirates, custom allows 
a husband to prevent his wife, minor children, and adult unmarried daughters from leaving the country, by 
taking custody of their passports.36
c) Barriers to birth registration and certification
Gender-based legal and regulatory barriers against women to birth registration and certification exist 
when women are not allowed to register the birth of a child or obtain a birth certificate for their child as 
easily as a man.37
One legal barrier faced by women is that only the father can register the birth of a child or that he is the 
first person in a list of people allowed to do so. In Greece, the father is legally obliged to register the child; 
if he is absent or impeded, this legal obligation falls on the doctor or midwife.38 In Barbados,39 Burundi,40 
Fiji41, the Islamic Republic of Iran,42 and Namibia,43 a mother can legally register the newborn only when 
the father is dead, absent, or incapable. In The Gambia, the father is legally required to register children 
born within a marriage. However, if a child is born out of wedlock, the father is not required to register 
the birth.44 The mother is legally responsible for registering the birth of children born out of wedlock and 
of children born in wedlock if the father is dead or absent.45 The same rules often apply to issuing a birth 
certificate, for example, in the Islamic Republic of Iran.46 Perhaps the most severe restriction arises from 
laws that stipulate that if the father is unknown, the birth of a child cannot be registered in the civil registry, 
as is the case in Bhutan (UNICEF 2013).
In other countries, mothers can register the birth of a child but need additional documentation, generally 
proof of marriage or the husband’s or another male family members’ authorization. In Bhutan, identification 
documents of both parents and their marriage certificate are necessary to register the birth of a child.47 In 
Egypt, while the father can always register the birth of a child, the mother may do so only if she provides 
proof of marriage.48 If she cannot prove her marital relationship, she can register the birth of her child only 
if she provides the testimony of a person who witnessed the birth49 (World Bank 2016a). In Greece, while 
the father is legally obliged to register the birth of a child, the mother needs a special mandate by a notary 
attorney to do so.50 In Kuwait, the original marriage contract is required to register the birth of the firstborn 
child and the father or paternal grandfather must go in person to collect the certificate from the relevant 
authority. An authorization letter or special power of attorney is needed when the father is outside the 
country and a letter from the prison commissioner is needed if the father is imprisoned.51
Gender-based legal differences create barriers to birth registration of children born out of wedlock if the 
mother alone cannot register the birth of her child. For example, in the Islamic Republic of Iran, if the 
parents’ marriage is not registered, both parents must appear before the civil registrar to register a child’s 
birth.52 In Nicaragua, a single mother can register the birth of her child alone when the father is unknown 
or does not recognize the child as his, but both parents need to register the birth of a child when living 
in a consensual union; otherwise, the child will not obtain the father’s surname. The father’s signature 
on the birth record is needed for paternal recognition of the child (UNICEF 2013). In Iraq and Jordan, an 
unmarried parent must obtain a court order to register the child.53
Discriminatory birth registration laws can trigger gender-based social stigma. For example, in Indonesia, 
before legislative reforms in 2014, children whose parents were unmarried or had a religious marriage, or 
whose father did not provide a letter of recognition to civil registry staff, were issued a birth certificate with 
only the mother’s name. Indonesians generally believed that a birth certificate with only the mother’s name 
carried a stigma, as it implies that the child was illegitimate and that this was an undesirable registration ACHIEVING UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO ID: GENDER-BASED LEGAL BARRIERS AGAINST WOMEN AND GOOD PRACTICE REFORMS8
outcome (Sumner 2015) (See section III.(b)3.2 for remedial reforms implemented by the Government of 
Indonesia).
Regulatory barriers exist as well. For instance, in countries with low rates of birth registration, proof of 
birth from village elders, birth attendants, or witnesses is often used to obtain proof of identity. However, 
meeting these requirements may be more burdensome for a woman than a man. For example, in Burkina 
Faso, the voter registration exercise in 2010 required a birth certificate. However, to get a birth certificate, 
citizens must have two witnesses, such as their mother or a midwife, to vouch for their birth in the country. 
This regulation is more burdensome for women to comply with as, unlike men, women leave their birth 
villages when they marry. Going back to the village to find witnesses is costly and challenging for women 
who may not be able to travel alone or take time away from child care and domestic work. Indeed, this 
requirement resulted in overwhelmingly low voter registration.54
d) Barriers to acquiring nationality
Nationality laws which do not grant women equality with men in conferring nationality on their children 
can perpetuate a cycle of statelessness which has serious consequences, including the absence of a legal 
identity and non-enjoyment of civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights.55 Statelessness is an 
increasing concern for the international community. It is an issue that implementors of ID programs must 
tackle, in accordance with nationality laws and international commitments, if are they are to be inclusive 
(Gelb and Metz 2017). UNHCR estimates that globally, at least 10 million people are stateless and over one-
third of the world’s stateless are children (UNHCR 2014).
Several countries prohibit or limit the rights of women to confer nationality on their children or a noncitizen 
spouse, a right that is almost universal for men (Theodorou 2014)56 and assured under Article 9 of the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW).
Just as discriminatory laws govern access to IDs, passports, and birth certificates, discriminatory nationality 
laws are deeply rooted in patriarchal social norms, with children born in marriage assumed to acquire the 
nationality of their father and married women that of their husband.57 Furthermore, the discriminatory 
laws and practices outlined in section II.(c) may lead to women and their children being unable to prove 
nationality, which is often a prerequisite for acquiring a national ID.58 The annex provides some background 
to the history of nationality rights under international law. 
Unmarried women cannot convey citizenship on their children in the same way as unmarried men in 18 
countries, and married women cannot confer citizenship on their children in the same way as married 
men in 26 countries (table 2). In Brunei Darussalam,59 Kuwait,60 Lebanon,61 and Qatar,62 only the father 
can convey nationality on children. Other countries, including The Bahamas,63 Barbados,64 Kiribati,65 and 
Malaysia,66 prevent mothers from conveying their nationality on children born abroad. Others, such as 
Saudi Arabia, prevent women from conveying nationality on children born to an unknown father.
When granting nationality, most countries apply rules that are primarily based on descent from a parent 
who is a citizen (Govil and Edwards 2014).67 Nationality laws based on paternal descent alone can cause 
statelessness if children cannot acquire the nationality of the father or a nationality based on their place 
of birth (UNHCR 2018). Such laws tend to render children stateless if (a) the father is stateless; (b) the 
father is unknown or not married to the mother at the time of the child’s birth; (c) the father’s country’s 
nationality laws do not permit him to confer nationality in certain circumstances, such as when the child 
is born abroad; or (d) the father has been unable or is unwilling to fulfil administrative steps to confer 
his nationality because, for example, he has died, has been forcibly separated from his family, or has 
abandoned the family.68
There are several examples of countries where a woman marrying a stateless person in her country of 
birth can risk statelessness for herself and her children. Brunei Darussalam,69 the Islamic Republic of Iran,70 9
 II. Gender-based legal barriers against women to identificationKuwait,71 Lebanon,72 Qatar,73 and Somalia74 do not allow mothers who are citizens of these countries and 
married to stateless men to confer their nationality on their children, even if this prohibition would result in 
their children becoming stateless (UNHCR 2018).
However, in other countries, the nationality laws provide for exceptions that allow women to pass their 
nationality on to their children when the father is stateless even while discriminating against women on 
other grounds.75 These include, for example, Bahrain,76 Guinea,77 Jordan,78 Libya,79 Mauritania,80 and the 
United Arab Emirates.81 In Iraq, children born abroad to an Iraqi mother may apply for Iraqi citizenship 
when reaching age of majority at 18 when the father is unknown or stateless.82
In Kuwait,83 Qatar,84 and Somalia,85 the mother is not allowed to pass her nationality to children born out of 
marriage or to an unknown father. The law of Kuwait, however, allows children of a Kuwaiti mother and a 
father who has not recognized them or is unknown to apply for citizenship when reaching age of majority 
at 21. Citizenship would in these cases be granted by decree upon the recommendation of the Minister of 
the Interior.86 In practice, however, this is an extraordinary measure and rarely occurs (UNHCR 2018).
Nationality laws may also discriminate against women when it comes to women’s ability to confer citizenship 
to their nonnational spouses. The Women Business and the Law database, (World Bank, forthcoming), finds T able 2. Discrimination against women in nationality laws

Box 3. The impact of statelessness resulting from gender discriminatory laws
Nabila, a Syrian mother, worries about her stateless daughter who was unable to acquire her father’s 
nationality before her parents divorced. She despairs, 
“Although my daughter has a good degree from Damascus University, without citizenship 
or identification papers, she cannot accept the many job offers and travel opportunities she 
receives. She is only 25 years old, but her future is bleak.” 
In Thailand, the lack of access to scholarship programs and student loans reserved for Thai nationals 
obstructs stateless children’s access to higher education. 
“I get pretty good grades,” says Patcharee (15), a stateless hill-tribe girl in Thailand. “Maybe I 
am even at the top of the class. But every time there is a scholarship, it is given to someone 
who has a national ID card.” 
Saida in Morocco was unable to pass on her own nationality to her children because she is a woman. 
Without nationality, her family had no right to residence, and when the children reached maturity, 
they faced the problem of leaving the country every three months to attain a visa and trying to 
return. Thankfully, the law was amended in 2007 changing the lives of thousands of children for the 
better, including Saida’s.

that 51 countries out of the 189 examined do not allow married women to pass their citizenship to their 
nonnational spouses in the same way as men. For example, in the Central African Republic,87 the Republic of 
Congo,88 Guatemala,89 Jordan,90 Malaysia,91 Oman,92 and The Philippines,93 nationality laws prevent women 
from passing their nationality to their husbands. Laws can also impose more stringent requirements on 
men trying to acquire their wives’ nationality than on women trying to acquire their husband’s nationality 
as is the case in St. Lucia94 and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.95 In these countries, the competent minister 
may refuse the granting of citizenship by marriage to husbands on reasonable grounds. Such laws can 
prolong situations of statelessness, for example, when women marry stateless men.
Nationality laws also frequently discriminate against women when it comes to the acquisition, loss, 
and retention of nationality by marriage and naturalization. These laws can contribute to situations of 
statelessness. Women tend to be more likely than men to assume their foreign spouse’s nationality upon 
marriage and are in some cases legally obliged to do so under the principle of dependent nationality.96 For 
instance, in the Islamic Republic of Iran, every foreign woman who marries an Iranian husband is considered 
an Iranian national.97 In Kuwait, a Kuwaiti woman who marries an alien will lose her Kuwaiti nationality if she 
acquires her husband’s nationality.98 Similarly, in Bahrain, if a Bahraini woman marries an alien, she shall lose 
her Bahraini nationality if she acquires the nationality of her husband.99
Women married to foreign nationals risk statelessness if there is a gap in legislation that allows or requires 
them to renounce their nationality without having acquired the nationality of the spouse or if the legislation 
does not let them retain their original nationality after losing their husband’s nationality.100 A safeguard 
against statelessness in the latter case is to allow the woman to keep the husband’s nationality or to revert 
to her original nationality. For instance, in Egypt, if a foreign woman acquires Egyptian nationality upon 
marriage to an Egyptian, she will not forfeit it with the termination of marriage, unless she has had her 
foreign nationality restored or gets married to a foreigner and acquires his nationality.10111
 II. Gender-based legal barriers against women to identificationForeign spouses also risk being rendered temporarily stateless until they are able to comply with the legal 
and administrative requirements needed to obtain a new nationality. Although this risk can, in principle, 
apply to both male and female foreign spouses, the requirements imposed by naturalization procedures 
such as language tests, proof of economic self-sufficiency, or housing may be more difficult for women to 
meet, as they may not have the same educational opportunities as men and are more likely to be financially 
dependent on their spouses.102
Refugees and other forcibly displaced people are particularly vulnerable to becoming stateless due to 
gender-discriminatory nationality laws and barriers to birth registration. Birth registration per se does 
not confer nationality, which is acquired through a state’s nationality law. However, registering a birth 
establishes a legal record as to where the child was born and the identity of the parents, key information 
for proving entitlement to nationality (UNHCR 2017). Hence, recently, the UN’s CEDAW Committee and the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) have urged state parties to ensure registration of births and 
issuance of birth certificates to allow access to basic services and avoid statelessness (see box 4).
Syrian refugees have suffered complex identification challenges due to their displacement. In Lebanon 
and Jordan, they have experienced barriers to birth registration and certification for a variety of reasons 
including complex and lengthy procedures, difficulty in accessing documentation, problematic physical 
access, and illiteracy (Norwegian Refugee Council 2017). Syrian women’s inability to confer nationality on 
their children combined with the massive displacement resulting from the ongoing conflict has resulted 
in a situation where a generation of Syrian children born abroad are at risk of being stateless. Children of 
Syrian refugees born in other countries cannot acquire the nationality of their mothers under Syrian law.103 
Syrian mothers can only confer nationality on their children if they are born in Syria and the father does 
not establish filiation in relation with the child.104 If the Syrian father is dead or missing, acquisition of the 
father’s nationality depends on the birth being registered, as well as the marriage and the father’s death, in 
accordance with Syrian law. However, many Syrian women refugees, separated from their husbands, lack 
the necessary documentation to prove their marriage and the paternity of children born abroad (Norwegian 
Refugee Council 2017). If the child is not able to obtain the father’s nationality, he or she will be stateless 
unless born in a country that provides nationality based on birth in the territory of a state (American Bar 
Association 2017; UNHCR 2017; Norwegian Refugee Council 2017).ACHIEVING UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO ID: GENDER-BASED LEGAL BARRIERS AGAINST WOMEN AND GOOD PRACTICE REFORMS12
Box 4. Recent UN recommendations concerning statelessness
The CEDAW Committee and the CRC have urged state parties to ensure registration of births and 
issuance of birth certificates and reform gender-discriminatory laws to allow access to basic services 
and avoid statelessness. Recent examples include the following:
CEDAW Committee recommendations for actions to avoid statelessness
  Concluding Observations to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (2017) express concern 
that while the law allows women who are Korean nationals living in China to transmit their 
nationality to their children, many choose not to register their children for fear of being forcibly 
repatriated to the state party’s territory. The CEDAW Committee recommends that the state 
party review its bilateral agreements to ensure that children born to Korean women residing 
abroad have access to birth registration and nationality without the children or their mothers 
being forcibly returned to the state party’s territory by third states. The CEDAW Committee also 
recommends taking retroactive measures for women whose children are stateless.
  Concluding Observations to Burkina Faso (2017) express concern that 20 percent of children 
are not registered at birth, which places them at risk of statelessness. The CEDAW Committee 
recommends intensifying efforts to ensure timely birth registration and the issuance of birth 
certificates as a means to facilitate access to basic services and to avoid the risk of statelessness.
  Concluding Observations to Kuwait (2017) express concern about the exclusion of disadvantaged 
groups of women and girls, including stateless bidun,a from basic social services, access to justice, 
decent work, citizenship, and access to birth and marriage certificates and identity documents 
and their heightened exposure to risks of violence, abuse, and exploitation, including sexual 
exploitation, forced labor, and trafficking in persons. The CEDAW Committee calls on Kuwait to 
ensure that birth certificates and other documents are issued to bidun women, men, and children 
as a means of preventing statelessness.
CRC recommendations in situations of forced displacement
  Concluding Observations to Angola (2018) express concern at how low rates of birth registration 
represent an obstacle to preschool and school enrollment and are a root cause of child labor, 
child sexual exploitation, and underage recruitment into the armed forces. The CRC recommends 
extending the current national mass birth registration campaign to parents, including non-
Angolan citizens, refugees, and asylum seekers, as this facilitates birth registration for their 
children; decentralizing birth registration to benefit rural and marginalized populations, including 
by establishing mobile birth registration teams; and introducing legal safeguards for children in 
the state party who would otherwise be stateless.
  Concluding Observations to Lebanon (2017) note how discrimination and practical obstacles 
precluded some categories of children from being registered, including Palestinian and Syrian 
refugee children and Dom and Bedouin children. The CRC recommends strengthening efforts 
to ensure that all births are registered, especially the births of children of refugees and asylum 
seekers, migrant workers, and historically stateless communities, including by streamlining 
documentation requirements and other barriers. The CRC also recommended reform of the 
legal framework on nationality to remove discrimination against women and provide adequate 
safeguards against statelessness.

56 In this paper, we use the terms nationality and citizenship interchangeably. It is worth noting, however, that the terms slightly 
differ, as citizenship is a narrower concept. It is a specific legal relationship between a state and a person that gives certain rights and 
responsibilities. In some Latin American countries, for example, Mexico, a person acquires nationality at birth but receives citizenship 
when reaching majority at 18. Mexican children, therefore, are nationals but not citizens. “What Is the Difference between Nationality

III. Removing gender-based legal barriers 
against women to identification
There has been growing recognition of the need to reform gender-discriminatory laws and regulations 
that produce barriers to acquiring legal IDs including birth certificates, national ID cards, and passports. 
Similarly, efforts have been made in recent years to remove discrimination against women from nationality 
laws. In some cases, discriminatory aspects of laws regulating access to identity and of nationality laws are 
due to legacy legislation in former colonies. However, while former colonial powers have largely removed 
constraints on women’s legal capacity to interact with public authorities and reformed nationality laws, 
many of the former colonies’ old codes have not been reviewed since independence (UNHCR 2017; World 
Bank 2018a).
Where successful reform has been achieved, it was championed at the highest levels of government, social 
norms were changing towards greater gender equality and civil society actors, including women’s groups, 
were instrumental in bringing about favorable changes in the law. In some cases, international human rights 
mechanisms, such as General Recommendations and Concluding Observations by the CEDAW Committee, 
led to reviews and triggered legal reforms. The following section highlights examples of recent good 
practices.
To start with, a comprehensive strategy to achieve the ‘legal identity for all’ goal should encompass reforms 
of marriage registration frameworks, especially when the lack of marriage documentation becomes a 
barrier to birth registration and certification (Hanmer and Elefante 2016).105 While there has been increasing 
attention to birth registration and the need to increase birth registration rates, there has been less attention 
on the importance of strengthening marriage registries. Nevertheless, marriage registration underpins the 
ability to claim many rights under the law, and some recent reforms and strategies have encompassed 
marriage registration. We briefly document this below in section b in the context of the Indonesian reforms 
to streamline the process for obtaining birth certificates and in section c as one of the initiatives adopted 
by the Jordanian government to facilitate birth registration of Syrian refugees.
a) Removing barriers to obtaining national ID cards and passports
In recent years, the introduction of digital ID systems has been accompanied by reforms that remove legal 
differences between men’s and women’s access to national ID cards. For example, Senegal enacted a new 
national identity card law in 2016 that introduced smart cards which combined voter and civil IDs using 
biometric information.106 The new law also reformed previous regulations imposing additional requirements 
on married women when applying for ID cards. A married woman is now no longer required to have her 
husband’s name on her ID card. Consequently, a wife no longer must provide supporting documentation to 
establish her husband’s name, and procedures are the same for both men and women (World Bank 2018a). 
In Iraq, the National Card Act of 2016 has removed all gender differences in the application process for the 
new Iraqi National Card, an electronic biometric card, which has replaced the Civil Identification Document 
(which required male consent).107 Iraq also enacted a new passport law in 2015 that includes electronic 
passports and mandates the same application process for men and women, removing the requirement for 
women to bring a male guardian.108
The use of innovative and secure means of identification, such as biometric IDs, yields specific benefits 
for women, by simplifying distribution barriers for national IDs and facilitating the delivery of public ACHIEVING UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO ID: GENDER-BASED LEGAL BARRIERS AGAINST WOMEN AND GOOD PRACTICE REFORMS18
and private sector services. A biometric ID is an identity card containing biometric information, such as 
fingerprints, irises, and facial images, which can be easily and quickly authenticated online. Biometric IDs 
provide women with a unique identity that is not tied to their spouse or another head of household. When 
these IDs are part of a digital ID system,109 they can be used to access digital ID-enabled services, such as 
opening a bank account, accessing loans, registering for a SIM card, and voting.
When digital ID systems are made available to providers of social programs to support enrollment and 
authentication, they can become a catalyst for lifting gender-based barriers to enrollment in these social 
programs. In Pakistan, for example, linking the new biometric computerized national identity card (CNIC) 
to the enrollment in the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP), a cash transfer program for the poor, 
caused a surge in CNIC enrollment of women, since cash transfers could be given only to the female head 
of the eligible household (box 3).
Evidence is emerging that digital ID systems, in addition to closing gaps in ID access, can increase women’s 
agency and open up economic opportunities. In India, the Aadhaar scheme110 has helped narrow the gender 
gap in mobile money account ownership. Between 2014 and 2017, account ownership in India rose by more 
than 30 percentage points. In 2014, men were 20 percentage points more likely than women to have a 
bank account. Owing to a strong government push to increase account ownership through biometric 
identification cards, the gender gap in account ownership has shrunk to 6 percentage points in 2017.
Box 5. Digital biometric IDs can increase women’s agency
Linking the new biometric CNIC to the enrollment in the BISP, a cash transfer program for the 
poor launched in 2008, was a deliberate move by the government to provide women with legal 
identification and to promote women’s empowerment. Indeed, through point-of-sale and automated-
teller machines, the BISP has introduced a biometrically authenticated delivery mechanism matching 
with their ID database to ensure a verified delivery of cash transfers to the women beneficiaries, rather 
than through their husbands or brothers, as had previously occurred.
In Pakistan, within four years of the launch of the BISP, there was an overall increase of 72 percent 
in the issuance of CNICs to the adult population in the country and a 94 percent increase in women 
enrollment. CNICs have played a crucial role in empowering Pakistani women. Women with CNICs 
felt a stronger sense of identity than they ever had before. Their families respected them more, which 
increased their self-confidence in sharing their opinions on household matters. Recipients of the BISP 
cash transfers said they felt financially empowered for the first time in their lives. Surveys conducted 
by the Oxford Management Group in 2014, 2015, and 2016 also show that the BISP has had a positive 
and statistically significant impact on the proportion of women who can access cash in an emergency, 
on the proportion of women who would always vote in local and national elections, and on the ability 
of women to travel alone within their communities. Female beneficiaries are also found to play a more 
active role in decision making within the household, including managing money and controlling how 
the cash transfer was spent—which was increasingly on nutrition and health.

 III. Removing gender-based legal barriers against women to identificationb) Removing barriers to birth registration and certification
Over the last 15 years, several countries have revised discriminatory laws and taken other steps to increase 
birth registration rates and make it easier to obtain birth certificates.
For example, in 2006, acting on the recommendations of the CEDAW Committee,111 Nepal amended the 
discriminatory provisions between women and men. Before these reforms, notice of a birth was given by 
the head of household and, in his absence, by the eldest male member of the family. Now, women as well 
as men can be designated head of household, and the eldest male member no longer provides the birth 
declaration if the head of household is absent.112 In Mozambique, the 2004 reform of the Civil Registration 
Code allowed either parent to register the birth and obtain a birth certificate.113 Single mothers are now 
free to register their children under their maiden name,114 and a woman may choose to register her child as 
having a father other than her husband.115
Free universal registration is considered the international norm (UNICEF 2013) as fees and fines risk further 
marginalizing the poor and most frequently excluded, including women. Evidence from Tanzania, Ghana, 
and Brazil suggests that the removal of registration fees acted simultaneously to eliminate a disincentive 
and create a positive incentive for registration (World Bank 2016b). Birth registration initiatives often 
eliminate or substantially reduce these costs. Tanzania and Ghana significantly extended the period of free 
registration; Brazil mandated that registration be free for everyone (Fagernäs and Odame 2013; Hunter and 
Sugiyama 2017; UNICEF 2013); and Angola made birth registration and the issuance of birth certificates 
free for all children under the age of 5 in 2007116 and subsequent legislation in 2013 and 2015 provides free 
birth registration and free issuance of birth certificates.117 However, in Angola, only the issuance of the first 
birth certificate, provided upon registration, is free. Birth certificates expire after one year from issuance, 
and requests for reissuance carry a fee.118 Angola is not the only one: fines and increased fees are still used 
to incentivize prompt birth registration in several countries. In Belize, if a child is not registered within 
42 days of birth, the parents must pay a fine for late registration and can be summoned to register the 
birth within one year.119 In Kenya, birth registration is free if it is done within six months, and a fee for late 
registration is imposed after that. Other countries that charge a fee for registering births after the required 
deadline include Angola, El Salvador, Ghana, Jamaica, Lesotho, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, and Vietnam (World 
Bank 2018a).
The link between poverty and low rates of birth registration is well established (UNICEF 2017b), and cash 
transfers, cash grants, and noncontributory pension programs are proving to be promising methods of 
promoting birth registration. Zimbabwe and India have recently implemented Conditional Cash Transfer 
(CCT) programs that mandate birth registration as a condition to receive the cash transfer. The CCT program 
in Zimbabwe resulted in a 16.4 percent increase in the registration rate of the beneficiaries’ children ages 
0–4 and in a 15 percent increase in the registration rate of school-age children. The Indian CCT program 
successfully improved registration of female children by 15 percent. In Brazil, many parents have obtained 
birth certificates as these were necessary to receive the Bolsa Família CCT. Because of the program, the 
percentage of unregistered births dropped from 27.1 percent in 1998 to 6.7 percent in 2012 (World Bank 
2016b).
To address other aspects of gender inequality that put women at a disadvantage, such as distance to 
registration facilities and constraints to traveling, many countries are introducing new systems to register 
births and obtain birth certificates, including web-based applications and the use of mobile technologies. 
For example, Bangladesh has introduced an online Birth Registration Information System, which allows 
registering births and obtaining birth certificates through an online application. All records are then stored 
in an online database, thus reducing delays, errors, and inconsistencies inevitably caused by the former 
manual registration process (UNICEF 2013).120 In Burkina Faso, a mobile system that allows births to be 
registered remotely is making registration more accessible, especially to rural people. The iCivil system 
creates a digital birth certificate using a mobile application and a bracelet with a unique code, which 
midwives attach to the baby’s wrist. The code with the baby’s details is scanned using the app and sent ACHIEVING UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO ID: GENDER-BASED LEGAL BARRIERS AGAINST WOMEN AND GOOD PRACTICE REFORMS20
to the civil registration authorities, which record the birth. A birth certificate can be collected at any 
civil registration center in the country by simply presenting the bracelet (UNHCR 2017).121 Online birth 
registration has the additional benefit of helping prevent tampering with birth dates to falsify the age of 
girls at marriage (Human Rights Council 2014). An alternative preventative measure against the altering 
of birth certificates is to issue the certificate on secure paper. In Guatemala, the National Civil Registry 
(RENAP) issues birth certificates with security features, including pictures of the child and the parents, on 
secure paper.122
Streamlining procedures is another effective practice to increase birth registration as it reduces the indirect 
costs of registration, such as time, lost earnings from entrepreneurship or other work, and travel costs. 
For example, birth certificates are not always issued immediately upon birth registration and a separate 
application procedure is required. To overcome the barriers created by the indirect costs associated with 
making the application, countries such as Morocco and Tanzania have combined birth registration and 
the issuance of a birth certificate into one process.123 In Tanzania, the application can be done at hospitals 
and health clinics at the time of immunization and is free of charge for children under the age of 5. Data 
are transmitted via text message to a centralized system.124 In Brazil, maternity hospitals provide for birth 
registration services, allowing parents to start the registration process even before going home with their 
new baby.125 In Indonesia, a landmark Constitutional Court decision in 2013 removed a requirement that 
the General Courts must provide a statement to get a birth certificate for a child over the age of 1 (Sumner 
2015).126
Indonesia provides a good example of combining legal and regulatory reforms to remove gender-based 
barriers to birth registration. Before the reforms, without proof of marriage, only the name of the mother 
could be included on the certificate, which implied that the child was illegitimate. For Indonesians, 
illegitimacy carries stigma, and so, parents who had traditional marriages or did not have marriage 
certificates for other reasons were reluctant to register their children. The reforms implemented in 2014 
have included the removal of administrative fees and provision of legal identity registration services in the 
villages through integrated and mobile services (Integrated Service Centers) which provide both marriage 
and birth registration services (Sumner 2015).
c) Removing discrimination against women from nationality laws
Over the last 15 years, several countries have succeeded in removing gender discrimination from nationality 
laws.127 UNHCR reports that successful legal reforms have been achieved through simple legislation, often a 
one-sentence provision replacing complicated legislation, granting men and women equal rights to confer 
nationality (UNHCR 2015).
Often, these reforms have been catalyzed by CEDAW recommendations (described in box 4). In Algeria, 
the old Nationality Code provided that an Algerian mother could confer nationality to a child if the father 
was stateless, unknown, or a foreigner. After Algeria’s first hearing before CEDAW in 1999, the CEDAW 
Committee recommended that the country reformed its nationality law to comply with Article 9(2).128 The 
CEDAW Committee’s recommendations spurred a reform of the Nationality Code in 2005, which repealed 
the limitations on Algerian mothers’ ability to confer nationality on their children, replacing them with a 
simple provision granting Algerian nationality to all children born in or outside of Algeria to an Algerian 
mother or father. The new provisions applied with retroactive effect, thus granting nationality to individuals 
born to Algerian mothers and foreign fathers before the reform. In 2009, Algeria was able to remove its 
previous reservation to Article 9(2) of CEDAW which requires states that are party to the convention to 
grant women equal rights with men with respect to the nationality of their children.
Similarly, Morocco’s old Nationality Code allowed women to confer nationality on their children only if the 
father was unknown or stateless. The CEDAW Committee’s calls to bring the country’s nationality laws into 21
 III. Removing gender-based legal barriers against women to identificationcompliance with Article 9(2),129 and the progressive 2004 reform of the Mudawana , the Moroccan personal 
status code, in light of universal human rights principles led to the adoption of a new Nationality Code in 
2007. The new code gave Moroccan women the same rights as men to confer nationality on their children, 
and with retroactive effect.
Other successful reforms include:
  Under the 1969 Kenyan Constitution, mothers and fathers could pass their nationality on to their 
children, but only fathers could confer nationality on children born abroad. Article 14 of the 2010 
Constitution of Kenya addressed this issue by providing that,“A person is a citizen by birth if on the 
day of the person’s birth, whether or not the person is born in Kenya, either the mother or father of 
the person is a citizen.”
  In Senegal, the 1961 Nationality Code contained complicated provisions distinguishing between 
children born in and out of wedlock and allowed women to pass their nationality only to children 
of an unknown or stateless father. In 2012, the Ministry of Justice implemented the government’s 
pledge to remove gender discrimination from nationality laws and a new 2013 law established that 
any child born as a direct descendant of a Senegalese national is Senegalese.
  The 2017 reform of the Sierra Leonean nationality law now allows women to confer nationality on 
their children born abroad, which was previously allowed to men only. Madagascar also reformed its 
nationality law in 2017 to allow mothers to confer their nationality on children on an equal basis with 
men. However, the new law still does not allow women to confer their nationality on their nonnational 
spouses, as men can. It just allows both spouses and children to retain their nationality if a spouse 
or parent loses theirs.
  The 2018 amendments to the nationality law of Sudan now allow people of South Sudan who lost 
their nationality after South Sudan independence in 2011 to reinstate their Sudanese citizenship.130 
Following the declaration of independence of South Sudan, the 1994 Nationality Act had been 
amended to revoke Sudanese nationality to any person “who has acquired, de jure  or de facto , the 
nationality of South Sudan.” This applied, for example, to children of Sudanese mothers and South 
Sudanese fathers. In June 2018, the National Assembly approved the amendments allowing women 
to confer their nationality on children where the father is from South Sudan. The amendments also 
remove the inconsistency between the country’s Nationality Act and the 2005 Constitution, which 
stipulates that, “Every person born to a Sudanese mother or father shall have an inalienable right to 
enjoy Sudanese nationality and citizenship.”131
  On November 4, 2018, the Iranian government approved an amendment to the Civil Code to allow 
children born to Iranian mothers and foreign fathers to apply for citizenship. The application can 
be submitted by the mother on behalf of minor children and by children of such unions as soon as 
they reach majority at the age of 18.132 Before the amendments, only children born of Iranian fathers 
and foreign mothers were automatically given Iranian citizenship. Fathers only could confer their 
nationality on their children in all circumstances.133
There has also been some progress in removing the causes of statelessness among the forcibly displaced 
that arise from discrimination against women in nationality laws. UNHCR has recently reported that the 
Government of Jordan has adopted a multipronged initiative to prevent the risk of statelessness for Syrian 
refugee children born in Jordan and Syrian refugees born in Syria who could not be registered before 
fleeing. These initiatives focus on making birth and marriage registration easier and more accessible to 
prevent statelessness. First, civil registration offices have been established in Jordan’s two largest refugee 
camps, Zaatari and Azraq, and mobile registration services have been established in the Emirati Jordanian 
Camp. Furthermore, registration fees were waived, procedures for late registration simplified, and judicial 
services were established in the refugee camps to facilitate official marriage registration, as a marriage 
certificate is required to register the birth of a child under Jordanian law. The Government of Jordan further ACHIEVING UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO ID: GENDER-BASED LEGAL BARRIERS AGAINST WOMEN AND GOOD PRACTICE REFORMS22
instituted two waiver periods during which Syrian refugees could regularize their marriages free of charge. 
These measures adopted between 2014 and 2016 have produced a 12-fold increase in birth registration 
among refugees in 2016 (3,642) and 2015 (3,645) compared to 2013 (295) (UNHCR 2017).
When it comes to the identification issues faced by stateless people, additional initiatives could be adopted 
where there is political will to do so. These could involve, for example, substitute documentation, such as 
records from local civil or religious leaders, or unlinking identification from nationality (Gelb and Clark 
2013). In Pakistan, for example, NADRA has allowed undocumented orphans to get national ID cards 
despite their unknown parentage and lack of citizenship (Gelb and Clark 2013).134 In India, the Aadhaar ID 
number can be issued to all citizens and residents of India, including foreign nationals,135 thus de-linking 
the concept of nationality from identification for secure authentication by third parties for service delivery.

IV. The forward agenda
Access to all forms of identification is an important stepping stone to women’s agency and freedom of 
movement. However, as this paper has shown, gender-based legal barriers against women significantly 
hinder access to identification in many countries.
Mobilizing governments, international organizations, and civil society actors to raise awareness about the 
impact of gender-discriminatory laws can accelerate progress toward addressing barriers that are holding 
back the achievement of the ‘legal identity for all’ SDG target, as an enabler to other SDGs, including SDG 
5, “Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls” (Gelb and Dahan 2015). International norms 
have proved important catalysts for change. UN agencies play an important role, particularly those that 
work to assist countries in implementing their treaty obligations to protect and promote women’s human 
rights, as demonstrated by the role of the CEDAW Committee in catalyzing reforms to nationality laws in 
Morocco (2004) and Algeria (2005). Similarly, UNHCR launched the Campaign to End Statelessness in 
November 2014—the #IBelong Campaign—an important call to action which aims to end statelessness 
by 2024. The campaign encourages states to take actions to remove gender discrimination in nationality 
laws. The World Bank’s Women, Business and the Law database has also contributed to the momentum 
for reform by raising awareness about the lasting effects that discrimination against women in the law can 
have on women’s economic inclusion and labor force participation and the costs to the economy overall.
Where ID registration is low, there is potential for investments in new systems to lift barriers, including 
through reforming gender-discriminatory legislation and employing design features enhancing women’s 
access to ID. The World Bank’s ID4D initiative brings global knowledge and expertise to assist countries 
realize the development prospects of digital identification systems and accelerate progress toward the 
SDGs. Strengthening civil registration systems is an essential complement to these efforts. Civil registration 
systems, including birth and marriage registration systems, have the potential to enable the world’s poorest 
to gain access to critical services, from education to health care and banking. To lift barriers faced by 
women, it is particularly important that the marriage registration system is strengthened.
Moving forward, explicit consideration of gender-based barriers to ID and identification of solutions 
to lift them will be increasingly necessary to achieve policy goals for poverty reduction set by national 
governments, development partners (including the private sector), and multilateral institutions. Failure to 
understand and reform the laws and regulations that produce gender-based legal barriers against women 
will limit the potential for interventions across a range of sectors—from ICT-based interventions to those 
which aim to increase economic opportunities, access to government services, financial inclusion, and 
effectiveness of cash transfers—to deliver results that benefit women and men equally.
Finally, while we have documented existing legal barriers to identification as well as some good practices 
in eradicating these hurdles, continuous research is required to keep available data current. Collection, 
analysis, and distribution of sex-disaggregated data on birth registration, different types of IDs, and 
stateless persons are necessary to effectively design, implement, and monitor development policies and 
programs.25
Annex. Equal rights to a nationality in  
international law
The international community recognized the importance of the right to a nationality as early as the 
1930s. The 1930 Hague Convention on Certain Questions Relating to the Conflict of Nationality Laws 
already recognized that the right of every person to a nationality was in the general interest of the 
international community. In 1933, the Montevideo Convention on the Nationality of Women called on 
states to end distinctions based on sex in nationality laws.
Following the forced displacements and mass denationalizations that occurred during World War 
II, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), adopted by the UN General Assembly in 
1948, gave formal recognition to the right to a nationality, which led to the inclusion of the right in 
international and regional treaty law.
The UDHR provides, “Everyone has the right to a nationality; No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of 
his nationality nor denied the right to change his nationality.” The International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights did not incorporate the right of everyone to nationality as stated in the UDHR 
but recognized the right of every child to a nationality. Similarly, the right of a child to acquire a 
nationality is included in the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child. Article 7(1) provides, “The 
child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from birth to a name, the 
right to acquire a nationality […].” Other international and regional legal instruments have guaranteed 
the right of a child to a nationality, including the International Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and the African Charter on the Rights 
and Welfare of the Child.
Among regional instruments, the American Convention on Human Rights recognizes the principle of 
jus soli in the acquisition of nationality. Article 20 provides that:
1. Every person has the right to a nationality;
2. Every person has the right to the nationality of the state in whose territory he was born if he does 
not have the right to any other nationality; and
3. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality or of the right to change it.
The more specific issue of discrimination against women in nationality laws was addressed very early 
by the international community. The 1957 Convention on the Nationality of Married Women provided 
that each contracting state agrees that neither the celebration nor the dissolution of marriage between 
one of its nationals and an alien, nor the change of nationality by the husband during marriage, shall 
automatically affect the nationality of the wife.
In 1979, CEDAW expanded on the principle of independent nationality of married women, by providing, 
in Article 9, that:
1. States parties shall grant women equal rights with men to acquire, change, or retain their nationality. 
They shall ensure in particular that neither marriage to an alien nor change of nationality by ACHIEVING UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO ID: GENDER-BASED LEGAL BARRIERS AGAINST WOMEN AND GOOD PRACTICE REFORMS26
the husband during marriage shall automatically change the nationality of the wife, render her 
stateless, or force upon her the nationality of the husband and
2. States parties shall grant women equal rights with men with respect to the nationality of their 
children.
Regional instruments have similarly addressed the issues of nondiscrimination in nationality law. The 
2003 Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa 
provides, “a woman shall have the right to retain her nationality or to acquire the nationality of her 
husband.” However, the protocol contains a caveat when it comes to the right to confer nationality on 
children: a woman and a man shall have equal rights with respect to the nationality of their children, 
except where this is contrary to a provision in national legislation or is contrary to national security 
interests.
More recently, the UN has responded to the recent refugee crisis and associated risk of statelessness 
by calling member states to implement reforms that ensure their legislation is consistent with Article 
9 of CEDAW. In 2014, the CEDAW Committee had issued its General Recommendation No. 32 on the 
gender-related dimensions of refugee status, asylum, nationality, and statelessness of women, which 
calls on member states to:
(a) Review and withdraw their reservations to Article 9 of CEDAW because they are incompatible 
with the object and purpose of CEDAW and thus impermissible under Article 28 (2);
(b) Review and reform their nationality laws to ensure equality of women and men with regard to 
the acquisition, changing, and retention of nationality and to enable women to transmit their 
nationality to their children and to their foreign spouses and to ensure that any obstacles to 
practical implementation of such laws are removed, in full compliance with Articles 1 to 3 and 9 
of CEDAW;
(c) Repeal laws stipulating the automatic acquisition of nationality upon marriage or automatic loss 
of a woman’s nationality as a result of changes in the marital status or nationality of her husband;
(d) Consider permitting dual nationality where women have married foreign men, and for the children 
born of such unions, especially in situations in which legal regimes providing for dual nationality 
may lead to statelessness;
(e) Prevent statelessness through legislative provisions making the loss or renunciation of nationality 
contingent on possession or acquisition of another nationality, and allow reacquisition of 
nationality for women left stateless owing to the absence of such safeguards; and
(f) Promote awareness of recent legal and policy development granting women equal rights with 
men to acquire, change, or retain their nationality or enabling women to confer their nationality 
to their children and their foreign spouses.
