Abstr act
The corona virus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has revealed many areas of public health preparedness that are lacking, especially
in lower- and middle-income countries. Digital interv entions provide many opportunities for strengthening health systems and
could be vital resources in the current public health emer gency. We provide several use cases for infection control, home-based
diagnosis and screening, empo werment through information, public health surveillance and epidemiology , and leveraging
crowd-sourced data. A thoughtful, concerted effort—le veraging existing experience and robust enterprise-grade technologies—can
have a substanti ve impact on the immediate and distal consequences of COVID-19.

Introduction
As of April 8, 2020, the total number of confirmed corona virus
disease (COVID-19) cases rose to 1,279,722 with 72,614 deaths
[1]. The outbreak that started at Wuhan city in China has now
spread worldwide, and on March 11, 2020, the World Health
Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic [2]. It
threatens human lives and has disrupted global trade, travel,
and emplo yment, which risks triggering a global economic
recession. China, India, and other countries have taken necessary
strict measures to control the spread of the virus, which,
although effective, can also lead to anxiety and the potential
loss of livelihoods [3]. The situation escalated so dramatically
that the Italian government was forced to change its lockdo wn
of only the northern region to encompass the entire country [4].
For now, the main objecti ves of mitig ation remain focused onreducing the velocity of the epidemic and minimizing the daily
burden of morbidity and mortality , thus, reducing the risk of
exhausting health care systems. This, in turn, helps to protect
local and regional economies, keeping the epidemic and its
impact manageable until a suitable antiviral drug is identif ied
or a vaccine can be developed [5].
We have seen many guidelines for health care workers (HCWs)
around preparedness for COVID-19 that focus on safety and
minimizing the spread of infection. Most countries have yet to
release a formal guideline or recommendation (either from the
government or health agencies), which emphasizes the powerful
role telemedicine and other digital health tools can play to
contain and manage this new pandemic. Small but signif icant
measures have made a difference, such as the US Office of Civil
Rights and Department of Health and Human Services decision

RenderXto suspend certain electronic communications privacy
regulations to allow providers to support patients via commercial
telehealth platforms, irrespecti ve of those platforms compliance
with health information security laws [6]. The applications of
digital technology for the treatment, diagnosis, support of
self-management, and surveillance during public health
emer gencies are well known. Many countries have existing
systems in place to address a variety of health care functions
without face-to-f ace contact [7]; the importance of taking
advantage of these cannot be understated. We call for
governments, health agencies, and health care providers to
immediately and coherently leverage the power of digital health
tools to strengthen their health care system capacity to respond
to the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper presents several use
cases to illustrate possible applications but is not an exhausti ve
or prioritized list. The use, feasibility , and importance of these
applications and others will vary by country needs, existing
infrastructure, and other factors.
Stronger Infection Control Through
Remote Monitor ing and Training
Contagious diseases like COVID-19 pose a serious threat to
HCWs and all levels of support staff who come into contact
with patients. The Ebola outbreak of 2014-2016 resulted in a
humanitarian crisis with more than 28,600 cases and 11,325
deaths [8]. During the height of the outbreak in August 2014,
WHO reported that 240 health workers had become infected in
West Africa; half of those workers lost their lives to Ebola [9].
The loss of HCWs exacerbates the situation and puts immense
pressure on already fragile health systems of lower- and
middle-income countries (LMIC) often struggling with limited
clinical human resources to begin with.
Teleconsultations With Early Stage or Mild COVID-19
As there are currently no curati ve treatments (antiviral drugs)
or preventive interv entions (vaccines), the recommended
treatment of uncomplicated COVID-19 cases is mostly
supporti ve with strict infection prevention and control (IPC)
measures [10]. WHO has recommended that suspected
COVID-19 cases with mild symptoms and no underlying
problems can usually be treated at home with careful clinical
monitoring [11]. However, trying to take appropriate
home-based measures without clear supervision and guidance
may create stress and even panic among symptomatic people
who may wonder when they are “truly sick” and need to seek
professional care. The use of teleconsultations is being widely
recommended in most high-income conte xts to protect health
facilities from being overwhelmed by cases with mild to
moderate illness that can be managed at home, as well as they
might be in a health care facility environment. In the United
States and Europe, most large health care systems have ramped
up the use of existing teleconsultation offerings to their
members, and a number of private sector companies offer
single-use telemedicine services to uninsured or out-of-group
clients.
In other conte xts, creati ve use of commercial video conferencing
platforms usually reserv ed for social interactions are beingrepurposed for clinician-patient interactions. To prevent the
spread of COVID-19 to high-risk patients with other
comorbidities requiring clinical follow-up, routine health care
interactions are being shifted to teleconsultations in many
countries around the world. In India, high-throughput tertiary
referral centers such as the All India Institute of Medical
Sciences are launching telemedicine services to replace
in-person check-ins during the pandemic [12], and the national
government has released on March 26 a set of National
Telemedicine Practice Guidelines [13]. Current levels of mobile
phone penetration and the level of internet connecti vity allow
for telemedicine solutions to be launched in most urban areas
of the world. The operational cost of running a telemedicine
center can be low compared to running primary care facilities
of specialized hospitals with similar catchment areas, reducing
the economic burden on strained health care facilities and
systems [14].
Remote Monitoring of Infection Prevention and
Contr ol
Keeping up with rapidly changing recommendations for IPC
during a pandemic is challenging. As the levels of
presymptomatic transmission of severe acute respiratory
syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV -2) becomes clear , we see
how medical staff may be vulnerable to infection or even be at
an increased risk for spreading infection in the community [15].
Doctors or other HCWs may inadv ertently keep attending
patients even after developing symptoms, leading to possible
iatrogenic infection and quarantine for many [16]. Digital tools
can play a crucial role in IPC by facilitating the monitoring and
quality control of IPC practices. So far during the current
outbreak, the Chinese government has reported 1716 cases
among health workers and 6 deaths [17]. The number of deaths
may seem low, but some studies suggest that infected HCWs
may have a more severe illness [18]. To reduce the risk of
hospital-based transmission, Guangdong Second Provincial
General Hospital in the Guangdong province of China has
implemented a proacti ve infection control tool that resembles
a security monitoring station. At this station, highly trained
infection control observ ers monitor IPC procedures, ensure
adequate IPC supplies, and provide real time aid by radio when
needed. Future plans for the system include the addition of
artificial intelligence algorithms to speed the ability to identify
high-risk situations and mitig ate them even more quickly [19].
Centralized Training and Capacity Building, Delivered
Digitally
Preparedness activities to date have focused on training and
capacity building of the health care staff on infection control,
isolating infected people, and tracing contacts of suspected
cases. All these tasks can be remotely managed from an
appropriately staffed national-le vel call center . Centralizing
training through the internet or mobile phones will make it easier
to train staff in rural and remote areas where provider and
training capacity is often variable. In this scenario, online
courses such as those provided by WHO and other public
domain courses for HCWs on COVID-19 can meet crucial
training needs [20].

RenderXSome barriers must be overcome to ensure the benef its of digital
health for remote monitoring, treatment, and training are
available worldwide. In the most remote areas of the world,
internet connecti vity is limited and not affordable for many.
Online formats are also not able to address the differences in
learning style or ability that might result in deviation from
standard care. In some cases, voice calling may be the most
appropriate way to provide telemedicine services, such as places
where internet penetration is low or with subpopulations like
older adults who may not be as familiar with advanced
technologies yet or are at greatest risk for critical illness. Even
so, leveraging digital health for remote observ ation and care,
where possible, may reduce costs and decrease the chances of
infection spreading from patients to HCWs and back to other
patients. It could also greatly help to relieve the emotional
turmoil and stress of a person with a suspected case and their
family members. The standard clinical recommendation in most
health crises to “seek medical attention” should be, in this
pandemic, “stay home if you are sick and call the corona virus
hotline to find out what to do next”. In fact, the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website makes it clear
that, during this pandemic, both patients with suspected
COVID-19 and those with routine illnesses should first “call
before you get medical care,” to prevent unnecessary exposures
to others, especially care providers [21].
Home-Based Diagnosis and Screening
Over the week end of March 14-15, travelers returning to their
home countries pack ed into tight queues at airports for
corona virus screening for hours. The reality of any crowded
area such as testing centers is now the same; any infectious
patient can transmit SARS-CoV -2 to those nearby . If a person
was not infected before they went for testing, they may become
infected simply by seeking testing. Testing for SARS-CoV -2
requires a minimum biosafety level (BSL)-2 to BSL-3 certif ied
laboratory to handle infectious samples according to the newly
published interim laboratory biosafety guideline from WHO
[22]. Many LMIC lack these kinds of facilities. In countries
where they do exist, they are usually located in major cities,
which suggests that most people who may be infected cannot
be tested or must travel far from home, possibly spreading
infection on the way.
Home-based diagnostics can alleviate the need for suspected
COVID-19 cases to travel, allowing people to continue the
recommended self-quarantine. Individuals or HCWs can request
a central emer gency operations center hotline to deplo y highly
trained personnel to collect required samples or assess and
transport patients to the hospital if necessary . Such an approach
has been used in Milan where a specialized COVID Response
Team worked with Emer gency Medical Services to dispatch
ambulances or test and monitor patients at home based on a
procedural algorithm [23]. This centralized deplo yment makes
sense from a resource-sparing perspecti ve; it is obviously much
easier to train a handful of sample collection personnel on
infection control than trying to manage hundreds or thousands
of noninfected and infected people interacting on their way to
hospitals or diagnostic centers. Centralized triaging and
deplo yment of personnel and equipment has been implementedin several countries, it is less common in the LMIC where it
would preserv e vital resources and act as an important form of
risk mitig ation.
Empo wering Through Information
Critical health advice to populations at risk changes rapidly
during public health emer gencies. Some actions are relati vely
simple, such as the WHO recommendation that all persons
returning from COVID-19-af fected countries stay home and
self-isolate for 14 days [24]. However, despite clear guidance,
ensuring that the message reaches not only public health
personnel but also community leaders and members is a
substantial challenge.
Centralized Helplines for COVID-19 Information
Formal media channels such as TV, newspapers, or international
and national website-based guidance provide a “firehose” of
information. Helpful and reliable information may be difficult
to pick out from the high-v elocity stream, and people can often
become confused with misinformation picked up from
hyper-sensationalized fringe news outlets and myths floating
around social media. Suspected cases and their caregivers may
be frustrated by apparently contradicting messages or when
encountering situations that are not clearly addressed by the
information they have access to. Being able to communicate
with a doctor or health professional trained in COVID-19 care
can be reassuring and maximize the likelihood of appropriate
and timely care. With a simple call to a helpline, both patients
and their caregivers can be empo wered with knowledge of how
to minimize risk of spread, basic home care, and when to notify
the health authority if the condition of a patient with COVID-19
deteriorates. It is likely more efficient to train call center–based
doctors on management of suspected cases than to conduct mass
communication campaigns necessary to ensure the general
population has sufficient knowledge to protect themselv es and
their communities. Mass communication campaigns may also
be ineffective in countries with low literac y rates. Another
advantage of centralizing information provision is quality
control; a digital knowledge base can be easily managed and
updated on a regular basis as the outbreak evolves and new
information and guidance emer ges. With COVID-19, initial
messaging around the disease’ s mild manifestation in those
younger than 65 years may have contrib uted to the widespread
misinterpretation that younger subgroups of populations are
immune from potentially dangerous complications; when in
reality , they are only at a lower risk than older adults.
Psychological Inter vention for the Quarantined
To contain the outbreak and limit its impact, WHO and CDC
experts recommend or even enforce the quarantine of infected
people (ie, those who have laboratory confirmation regarding
the presence of SARS-CoV -2) while suspected cases are asked
to self-isolate. Today , several cities around the world are locked
down, their residents prohibited from venturing outside except
to visit the doctor or get food. Many governments have
recommended or required suspension of mass gatherings
including offices, factories, museums, schools, universities, and
libraries [25]. Some cities enforce barriers to entry—no one is

RenderXallowed to get into those cities unless absolutely necessary . This
level of containment on a global scale is unprecedented.
These necessary but extreme measures are stressful for most
and, for some, lead to panic and a loss of equanimity . News
reports and social media show empty shelv es in supermark ets
where people depleted basic supplies like toilet paper , paper
towels, cleaners, and nonperishables. These stark photos show
the tenuous emotional state of those who are being asked to
adopt a set of behaviors never before seen in this generation.
Not surprisingly , a recently published review on the
psychological impact of quarantine revealed that people in
quarantine show anger , confusion, frustration, fear, and
symptoms resembling post-traumatic stress disorder [26].
Asking citizens to make such sacrif ices without appropriate
support is unsupportable in a civilized world. We can use digital
communication to deliver mental health support, provide
counseling, and link individuals through online social netw orks.
This also protects counselors and psychologists who will be
able to provide support without exposing themselv es to the
pathogen. Digital platforms for telepsychiatry and online support
are not unusual nowadays in some areas of the world, but much
more could be done to leverage their unique ability to meet
these needs. Many countries face severe challenges to addressing
the needs for psychological support during times of crisis [27].
The addition of telemedicine means that the counsellor need
not be in the same area or even in the same country . These
efforts can be managed regionally or even with the minimum
requirement that both the counsellor and counselee speak the
same language. Some nonprof it organizations already provide
peer mental health crisis support through digital platforms [28];
these models could be built on to address the needs of various
populations worldwide.
Another crucial area that could be addressed through digital
means is risk communication around public health measures.
WHO guidelines for risk communication in public health
emer gencies point to the importance of unified messaging that
is adaptable to local conte xts [29]. People need an
understandable rationale, especially in situations where longer
quarantine is necessary . Various approaches can provide
information and collect community feedback quite easily
through digital methods without risking any health y lives.
However, one important caveat holds true for all risk
communication during emer gencies, as well as for any
interv ention in general: the acceptance and effectiveness of such
measures must be rigorously evaluated, monitored, and updated
as needed.
Public Health Surveillance and
Epidemiology
Digital tools can be invaluable to reduce exposure risk for public
health personnel. Using a variety of remote methods, critical
tasks can be performed from safe environments while gathering
and analyzing the high-quality data necessary to mitig ate the
effects of the pandemic.Contact Tracing
Contact tracing is a standard procedure implemented during an
outbreak to determine the extent of the outbreak by identifying
and maintaining contact with persons who were exposed to a
confirmed case (and thus have high probability of becoming
cases themselv es) [30]. Traditionally , outbreak investig ators
would go door-to-door to unearth detailed information of the
contacts, which requires enormous amounts of time and human
resources. If the disease is contagious enough, the speed of
contact tracing can be outpaced by the number of cases and
disease spread. Helle well and colleagues [31] argued that the
probability of controlling an outbreak through isolation of cases
and contacts drops if initial numbers of cases are high, if there
is higher transmission during incubation period, and if the
transmissibility basic reproduction number stands between
2.5-3.5. Digital technology may solve that problem by providing
a more agile and less resource-consuming approach. After
confirming a case, their contacts can be traced over the phone
while recording information into an electronic medical record
(EMR) or contact management database. All contacts can then
be followed up over time through the telephone without
requiring face-to-f ace contact and further infection risk.
Automated text message or interacti ve voice response systems
can maintain continued contact over the relevant risk period of
7-14 days to detect early symptoms and refer sick persons to
information about self-care or care-seeking, as appropriate.
In most parts of the world the health care system is pluralistic
(made up of public, private, and nongo vernment organization
providers), and resource constraints make it difficult to regulate
care. In these settings, services are often offered under the radar ,
and patients are free to choose and change hospitals at will,
resulting in almost no ability to track who is going where. Even
in the absence of an interoperable digital health information
system that could facilitate disease surveillance, a centralized
EMR system, accessible through a web interf ace or smartphone
app, can facilitate the tracking of COVID-19 cases during this
public health emer gency.
Leveraging Crowd-Sour ced Data
So many factors can interfere with the careful public health
reporting needed in epidemics: hospital channels may require
excessi ve paperw ork or administrati ve procedures, training may
be lacking, or resources for reporting just do not exist. Right
now, we need innovative solutions to ensure health care facilities
can stay prepared. In a recently published article toward early
analysis of the COVID-19 outbreak, Sun et al [32] showed how
a health care–oriented social netw ork can be a source of data
collection and information sharing. In such scenarios, health
care–oriented social netw ork sites can provide real time data
and serve as an early alarm to an imminent outbreak, which can
be contained with minimal resources if timely responses can be
ensured. In this recent outbreak, Chinese doctors who sounded
the alarm in early January 2020 about an unusual pneumonia
were later silenced with the accusation of spreading
misinformation [33]. Had that alarm been taken seriously , it
may have been possible to avert to some extent a global
pandemic and its potential long-term health, social, and
economic consequences.

RenderXAnother promising project focuses on crowd sourcing artificial
intelligence tasks for a database of COVID-19 research outputs
[34]. The COVID-19 Open Research Dataset, a joint project of
government, academic, and private institutions, compiles
thousands of research articles on SARS-CoV -2 and related
corona viruses. Machine learning researchers are asked to
complete and submit tasks that analyze data from the database,
with research questions such as “What is known about
transmission, incubation, and environmental stability?” Such
challenges build on the success of previous efforts that showed
that incorporation of corrected Google Flu Trends while
forecasting influenza-lik e illness impro ves accurac y when
compared to reporting done only through formal reporting
channels [35]. As the WHO Scientif ic and Technical Advisory
Group for Infectious Hazards has recommended to monitor
public health strate gies with intensif ied active surveillance,
innovative data sources and crowdsourced tasks could add
signif icant value [36].
However, the challenge remains to ensure the reliability and
validity of data sourced through social media. Social media
posts are voluntary submissions on the part of individuals and
groups, and lack any sort of gatekeeping. Although it is
reassuring to see that several major platforms recently decided
to commit to working together to stop the spread of corona virus
misinformation, the global reach of these platforms means that
this will be a difficult task [37]. Keeping this in mind, it is high
time that relevant stakeholders and regulatory bodies determine
how to tackle this problem in the era of the fake news and
misinformation epidemic (infodemic) [37].
Conclusion
In the midst of such a global crisis all possible opportunities
need to be adequately explored and leveraged. Some countries
have started taking several initiati ves but often in a siloed
manner . In Bangladesh, both the government and a few privateorganizations have started rolling out toll-free (or with minimal
charge) hotline numbers for providing people with authenticated
information and guidance on what to do if someone suspects
they are infected by SARS-CoV -2 or actually shows symptoms
of COVID-19. We also have seen the viral spread of videos
with animated viruses or catch y dance steps promoting hand
washing, aimed at a tech-sa vvy generation of connected
millennials. Such measures are sporadic with likely minimal
impact on the pace and consequences of this pandemic.
A thoughtful, concerted effort leveraging existing experience
and robust enterprise-grade technologies can have a substanti ve
impact on the immediate and distal consequences of COVID-19
as well as other future health care needs. Many countries have
systems in place that could be leveraged in the current
emer gency. Building on existing infrastructure and systems will
help speed digital interv entions into practice and reduce costs.
As we are seeing therapeutics and vaccines against this novel
corona virus being fast-track ed, so too must we identify and
accelerate the use and adoption of digital strate gies such as those
described in this paper . Normati ve agencies like WHO can help
rapidly convene the expertise needed to develop the content
(eg, decision logic and workflo ws) and data models (eg,
recommended variable types and names) that would help
developers expedite locally appropriate solutions that are built
on validated content but also interoperable—allo wing
deidentif ied data to be rapidly pooled as part of global efforts
to understand emer gent pandemic threats. Unlik e the 1918
influenza pandemic, which claimed an estimated 50 million
lives, we are confronting COVID-19 within the conte xt of a
digital, connected planet. Digital health solutions have been
reviewed and vetted by global health agencies like WHO [7]
and are available to be deplo yed in short order through
public-pri vate partnerships. This is only possible if we move
quickly , like we have for other conventional mitig ation
strate gies, to appro ve their use to prepare, detect, contain, and
better understand this daunting pathogen.
