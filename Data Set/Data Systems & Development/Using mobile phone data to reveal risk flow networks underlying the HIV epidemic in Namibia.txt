Twenty-six million people are living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa; epidemics are widely
dispersed, due to high levels of mobility. However, global elimination strategies do notconsider mobility. We use Call Detail Records from 9 billion calls/texts to model mobility inNamibia; we quantify the epidemic-level impact by using a mathematical framework based onspatial networks. We ﬁnd complex networks of risk ﬂows dispersed risk countrywide:
increasing the risk of acquiring HIV in some areas, decreasing it in others. Overall, 40% ofrisk was mobility-driven. Networks contained multiple risk hubs. All constituencies (admin-istrative units) imported and exported risk, to varying degrees. A few exported very highlevels of risk: their residents infected many residents of other constituencies. Notably, pre-valence in the constituency exporting the most risk was below average. Large-scale networksof mobility-driven risk ﬂows underlie generalized HIV epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. In
order to eliminate HIV, it is likely to become increasingly important to implement innovativecontrol strategies that focus on disrupting risk ﬂows.https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23051-w OPEN

Saharan Africa (SSA)1. In this region, HIV epidemics are
generalized and populations are highly mobile2–4. How-
ever, global HIV elimination strategies do not take mobility intoconsideration. Multiple phylogenetic and epidemiological
studies
5–12of HIV in SSA have shown the importance of mobility
for the dispersal of HIV, and the effect of mobility on HIV
transmission. Individuals travel and have sex partners who live
outside their home communities. Therefore, high levels of mobi-
lity can change who is at risk of infection, who transmits infection
and where transmission occurs. Due to the dif ﬁculty of collecting
data on mobility at a large spatial scale, previous studies5–12have
focused on small geographic areas. Here, we study the impact of
mobility on a high-prevalence HIV epidemic in SSA at the
national level. We use a large-scale mobility network (constructed
using Call Detail Records (CDRs) from mobile phones) that spans
an entire country: Namibia (Fig. 1a). Worldwide, Namibia has one
of the worst HIV epidemics; in 2017, the most recent survey found
HIV prevalence to be ~15% in women and ~8% in men 15 –49
years old13. HIV treatment has been rolled out in all countries in
sub-Saharan Africa, and coverage levels are now high13–15. The
effect of HIV treatment on transmission is now well known16–18.
Here, our objective is to obtain an understanding of the effect of
mobility on HIV transmission. Therefore, we conduct a retro-
spective analysis, and evaluate the effect of mobility on Namibia ’s
HIV epidemic a decade ago, before HIV treatment was widely
available. Our results lead to a new conceptual understanding of
the dynamics of generalized HIV epidemics in SSA. We discuss
the importance of our results for guiding current HIV elimination
strategies.
Namibia has a population of ~2.5 million people, and the
second lowest population density in the world. The country is
divided into three administrative levels: 14 geographic regions, 54
provinces, and 121 constituencies. Due to its economy, Namibia
has a highly mobile population. The economy is heavily depen-
dent on mining, ﬁsheries, large-scale farming and high-end
tourism19. This has led to a system of circular migration of labor
to mines, ports, farms, urban areas, and tourism nodes. Both
women and men move around the country seeking employment;
the most recent data show that ~70% of Namibians, 15 years or
older, are economically active19.
CDRs have an unmatched potential to measure population
movements, and have been shown to be a key tool for retro-
spective analysis20. Over the past decade, CDRs have increasinglybeen used in health research20–31; particularly to model the geo-
graphic spread of infectious diseases32, most recently SARS-CoV-
222,28. In these studies, population mobility networks are modeled
by using algorithms to aggregate large datasets of CDRs intoOrigin-Destination (OD) matrices. The CDRs that we use have
previously been used by Ruktanonchai and colleagues to evaluate
the impact of mobility on malaria transmission in Namibia
29, and
to design novel malaria elimination strategies30,33. We use the OD
matrix that they constructed34; it contains aggregated CDRs from
9 billion calls/texts made from 1.19 million unique SIM cards over
a 12-month period (October 2010 to September 2011) in
Namibia29. The CDRs had been aggregated using an algorithm
that accounts for the time spent by each individual in each con-
stituency. In the OD matrix, rows specify the constituencies where
individuals live, columns specify the constituencies they visit, and
the entries/coef ﬁcients in the matrix specify weights. The weights
are estimates of the average amount of time residents of one
constituency spent in another constituency over 1 year. It is not
possible to construct gender-speci ﬁc OD matrices, because CDRs
are collected anonymously. Therefore, we used the same OD
matrix for both genders. To check whether this was an appropriate
assumption we conducted two analyses. First, we determined
whether one gender was more likely than the other to have owned
or used a mobile phone. Second, we determined if there were
gender differences in travel behavior.
A mobility network based on CDRs only re ﬂects the mobility
of individuals who use mobile phones. By 2012, 93% of Nami-
bians (18 and older) were using mobile phones; therefore, the
mobility network that we use re ﬂects the mobility of a very high
percentage of the population. Namibians who did not use mobile
phones, in comparison with those who did, were more likely to
live in very rural areas, have a low level of education, be unem-
ployed, and older than 55. The movements of these individuals
(who constitute 7% of the population) are not included in the
mobility network. Conversely, the movements of some non-
residents (e.g., tourists or business travelers) —if they had bought
a local SIM card —are included in the mobility network. Given
that Namibia had a population of 1.34 million individuals (15 or
older)35and a very high percentage of the population were using
mobile phones (with some owning more than one SIM card36),
relatively few of the 1.19 million SIM cards in the database would
have been owned by non-Namibians. Consequently, the move-
ments of non-residents would have had little effect on the
mobility network.

determine the effect that mobility had on the risk of acquiring,
transmitting, and dispersing HIV in the time before treatment
was made widely available. We conceptualize HIV epidemics asspatial networks consisting of communities that import and/or
export risk; communities are interconnected by groups of indi-
viduals moving, on a temporary basis, between them. Mobility is
speciﬁed by the OD matrix. A community imports risk if their
residents are at-risk of being infected with HIV by residents of
other communities. Risk can be imported into a community by
either of two mechanisms: (i) their uninfected residents visit other
communities and acquire HIV, or (ii) HIV-infected residents of
other communities visit and transmit HIV. The greater the ﬂow
of imported risk to a community, the more vulnerable the com-
munity is to the risks posed by the other communities. The most
vulnerable communities are called in- ﬂow risk hubs. A commu-
nity exports risk if their residents have the potential to infect
residents of other communities. Risk can be exported from a
community by either of two mechanisms: (i) their HIV-infected
residents visit other communities and transmit HIV, or (ii)
uninfected residents of other communities visit and acquire HIV.
The greater the ﬂow of exported risk from a community, the more
“risky ”the community is to the other communities. The most
risky communities are called out- ﬂow risk hubs.
In our spatial network modeling framework, each node
represents a constituency, and each link represents a mobility-
driven risk ﬂow between two constituencies. Risk ﬂows are gen-
der-speci ﬁc: the risk of acquiring HIV for women depends upon
the prevalence of HIV in men, and the risk of acquiring HIV for
men depends upon the prevalence of HIV in women. Our fra-
mework enables us to quantify and visualize countrywide net-
works of mobility-driven risk ﬂows, determine the drivers of risk
ﬂows, detect in- ﬂow and out- ﬂow risk hubs, and ﬁnd the geo-
graphic location of every risk hub in Namibia. The residents of
constituencies that are in- ﬂow risk hubs are at the greatest risk of
acquiring HIV from individuals, who live outside their con-
stituency. The residents of constituencies that are out- ﬂow risk
hubs have the highest probability of transmitting HIV to indivi-
duals, who live outside their constituency. A mathematical
description of the spatial risk ﬂow networks is given in the
methods.
Results
Gender and mobility . We did not ﬁnd gender differences among
adults in Namibia in the ownership of mobile phones (84.3%
(women), 84.2% (men)), the usage of mobile phones (93.0%
(women), 92.8% (men)), or in the frequency of phone calls and
texting (Supplementary Table 1). We did ﬁnd that women (15 –49
years old) were slightly less likely to have taken overnight trips
than men: 37% of women versus 43% of men (Supplementary
Table 2). However, similar proportions (18%) of each gender took
trips that lasted for more than a month.
The effect of mobility on changing risk . The mobility network
(Fig. 1b, which is a visualization of the OD matrix), shows that
the population of Namibia was highly mobile, and both short and
long distance trips were common. On average, residents spent
2.6 months per year outside their home constituency between
October 2010 and September 2011, although there was con-
siderable geographic variation, ranging from approximately
1–6 months (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 1). As a result of the
speciﬁc travel patterns, many of the constituencies were highly
connected (Fig. 1b). In 2010, there were 107 constituencies in
Namibia; 11 of these are not represented in the mobility networkbecause, due to a low population density, they lacked cell phone
towers.
To conduct our analyses, we needed to estimate the prevalence
of HIV in women and men at the approximate time that theCDRs were collected. However, the ﬁrst estimate of HIV
prevalence in Namibia, based on a representative sample of the
population, was based on data collected in 2013
37. At that stage of
the epidemic, HIV prevalence was relatively stable38. Therefore,
we made the parsimonious assumption that prevalence did not
change substantially between 2010 and 2013. In 2013, the average
prevalence in women and men (aged 15 –49 years old) was 17 and
11%, respectively37. However, there was considerable geographic
variation: ranging from 6 to 39% in women (Fig. 2b), and from 0
to 24% in men (Fig. 2c). Notably, the prevalence patterns were
considerably different for men and women.
The connectivity-prevalence matrix (Fig. 2d) shows the effect
that the mobility network (Fig. 1b) had on changing the risk of
acquiring HIV for men. Data below the diagonal show the
proportion of men who spent time in constituencies, where the
prevalence of HIV in women was higher than in their home
constituency; these men potentially increased their risk of
acquiring HIV. Data above the diagonal show the proportion of
men who spent time in constituencies, where the prevalence in
women was lower than in their home constituency; these men
potentially decreased their risk of acquiring HIV. Data along the
diagonal show the proportion of men who spent the majority of
their time in their home constituency, and in other constitu-
encies, where prevalence in women was similar to that in their
home constituency. The level of risk for these men essentially did
not change. We found similar results for women (Supplementary
Fig. 2). Taken together, our results imply that there were
substantial mobility-driven risk ﬂows, for both genders, among
different areas of Namibia in the time before treatment was
widely available.
Risk ﬂow networks: risk importation .W ef o u n dt h a ta l lc o n -
stituencies imported risk to some degree. Imported risk for
men, and the mechanism by which it was imported, is shown in
Fig.3a: orange data show the risk that was imported into each
constituency due to travel by its uninfected male residents,
green data show the risk that was imported into each con-
stituency due to visits from HIV-infected women, who lived in
other constituencies. Stacked values (orange plus green data)
show the total amount of risk that was imported into each
constituency. Constituencies in Fig. 3a are ordered based on
HIV prevalence in women: from the lowest (6%) to the highest
(39%). Supplementary Fig. 3 shows similar results, as in Fig. 3a,
for women.
We de ﬁned in- ﬂow risk hubs as constituencies that were in the
top 40% of constituencies in terms of imported risk: 38
constituencies were risk hubs. Each risk hub has a different
amount of risk ﬂowing into it; the greater the in- ﬂow of risk, the
more important the constituency is as a risk hub. Some
constituencies (e.g., Oshakati East: blue dot, Fig. 3a) were in-
ﬂow risk hubs for men, primarily because they were visited by
HIV-infected women who lived in other constituencies (green
data). Other constituencies (e.g., Kongola: red dot, Fig. 3a) were
in-ﬂow risk hubs for men, primarily because of travel by their
uninfected male residents (orange data).
The in- ﬂow risk network for men in Oshakati East (Supple-
mentary Fig. 4) shows which constituencies the female visitors
were from, and the magnitude of the in- ﬂow of risk from each
constituency. Risk was imported because many of the female
visitors were from constituencies, where HIV prevalence in
women was higher than in Oshakati East.NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23051-w ARTICLE

Supplementary Fig. 5) shows which constituencies its male
residents visited, HIV prevalence in women in those constitu-
encies, and the magnitude of the in- ﬂow of risk from each
constituency. Even though prevalence in women in Kongola was
extremely high (26%), risk was imported because male residents
of Kongola visited a constituency (Katima Muliro Urban), where
prevalence in women was even higher, 39% (Fig. 3b).
Risk ﬂow networks: risk exportation . We found that all con-
stituencies, as well as importing risk, exported risk to some
degree. Exported risk for men, and the mechanism by which it
was exported, is shown in Fig. 4a: orange data show the risk (for
men) that was exported from each constituency due to visits from
uninfected men who lived in other constituencies, green data
show the risk (for men) that was exported from each constituencydue to travel by their HIV-infected female residents. Stacked
values (orange plus green data) show the total amount of risk (for
men) that was exported from each constituency. Constituencies
in Fig. 4a are in the same order as in Fig. 3a. Supplementary Fig. 6
shows similar results, as in Fig. 4a, for women.
We de ﬁned out- ﬂow risk hubs as the top 40% of constituencies
in terms of exported risk: 38 constituencies were risk hubs. Each
risk hub has a different amount of risk ﬂowing out of it; the
greater the out- ﬂow of risk, the more important the constituency
is as a risk hub. Notably, only a few out- ﬂow risk hubs exported a
great deal of risk. Windhoek West (blue dot, Fig. 4a) was the most
important exporter of risk for men, even though prevalence in
female residents of Windhoek West was well below the national
average (12% vs. 17%). Windhoek West was the most important
out-ﬂow risk hub, because it was a very important mobility hub
and many of the male visitors to Windhoek West were from
constituencies, where prevalence in women was lower than 12%.

risk hub for men where risk was exported due to the travel
behavior of their HIV-infected female residents (green data).
Rundu Urban (Fig. 4b) exported risk to many constituencies, near
and far; risk was exported because prevalence in women in Rundu
Urban was much higher (26%) than in the constituencies the
women visited. Other constituencies (e.g., Windhoek West) were
out-ﬂow risk hubs for men, primarily because they were visited by
uninfected men who lived in other constituencies (orange data).
The out- ﬂow risk network from Windhoek West (Fig. 4c, d)
shows which constituencies the male visitors were from, HIV
prevalence in women in those constituencies, and the magnitude
of the out- ﬂow of risk to each constituency.
Mobility-driven risk of acquiring HIV . We used our risk ﬂow
networks to calculate the average overall annual risk of acquiring
HIV in Namibia, subdivided into three components: risk due to
localized transmission in an individuals ’home constituency, risk
due to visiting other communities, and risk due to residents of
other communities visiting an individuals ’home constituency.
We de ﬁne localized transmission as transmission between resi-
dents of the same constituency, when they are in their homeconstituency. We found that the majority of the risk (60%) was
due to localized transmission, 25% of the risk was due to visiting
other communities, and 15% of the risk was due to residents of
other communities visiting an individuals ’home constituency.
Overall, ~40% of the total risk was due to mobility-driven
transmission. We obtained similar results for men and women.
Identifying the geographic location of risk hubs . Figure 5a
shows the geographic location of all out- ﬂow risk hubs. The red
data show the top 10% of constituencies in terms of exported risk,
i.e., the most important out- ﬂow risk hubs. Five of these risk hubs
are constituencies that are very close together in the central part
of the north, the other ﬁve risk hubs are widely dispersed
throughout the country.
Figure 5b shows the geographic location of all in- ﬂow risk hubs
in Namibia. The red data show the top 10% of constituencies in
terms of imported risk, i.e., the most important in- ﬂow risk hubs.
Several of the important in- ﬂow risk hubs are close to important
out-ﬂow hubs in the central part of the country in the north, and
in the Zambezi region in the northeast. Notably, two constitu-
encies are very important as both in- ﬂow and out- ﬂow risk hubs:
Oshakati East and Ondangwa, neighboring constituencies in thenorth (the only constituencies shown in red in both Figs. 5a
and5b).
Discussion
The effect of treatment on generalized HIV epidemics in SSA is
well known
16–18. Previous studies have made important con-
tributions to our understanding of the impact of mobility on
transmission at the community level5–12. However, very little is
known about the effect of mobility —at the population level —on
these generalized epidemics. Here by reconstructing the state of
the HIV epidemic in Namibia a decade ago (before treatment was
widely available) and using CDRs to model population-level
mobility, we were able to evaluate the effect of mobility on an
HIV epidemic at the national-level. Using a modeling framework,
we discovered that a combination of high levels of mobility,
substantial geographic variation in prevalence, and speci ﬁc travel
patterns, had generated complex risk ﬂow networks that spanned
Namibia. The networks dispersed risk throughout the country:
increasing risk in some areas, decreasing risk in others. All con-
stituencies were vulnerable to the in- ﬂow of risk, some more than
others. Some risk ﬂows were between constituencies that were
close together, others were between constituencies that were
geographically very far apart. All constituencies posed some
degree of risk to other constituencies. A few constituencies were
extremely risky; the most risky was Windhoek West, where
prevalence was slightly less than the national average. Our results
show that mobility has been extremely important for the acqui-
sition, transmission, and dispersal of HIV in Namibia: overall,
~40% of the total risk of acquiring HIV was driven by mobility.
More importantly, taken together, our results provide a new
conceptual understanding of generalized HIV epidemics in SSA:
i.e., they should be understood as large-scale complex networks of
mobility-driven risk ﬂows. Our results imply that, to eliminate
HIV, it will be essential to design new control strategies that focus
on disrupting these risk ﬂows.
Many other countries in SSA have similar characteristics to
Namibia: substantial geographic variation in the prevalence of
HIV, a highly mobile population, and circular migration.
Therefore, spatial risk ﬂow networks are likely to exist in these
countries, and throughout SSA. Networks will be country-spe-
ciﬁc: they will depend upon the mobility level of the population,
the geographic variation in HIV prevalence, and the degree to
which travel patterns link high-prevalence and low-prevalence
areas. The importance of mobility on HIV epidemics can be
expected to vary by country39,40.

transmission16–18. HIV treatment in Namibia, as in other coun-
tries in SSA, was rolled out based on geographically targeting
high-prevalence areas41; high-prevalence areas are de ﬁned as
Hot-Spots. Hot-Spots were disproportionally allocated treatment.
This targeting strategy was based on two assumptions, that: (i)
risk was localized, and (ii) the highest prevalence areas were the
areas of greatest risk. However, we have found that these two
assumptions did not hold in Namibia; a substantial proportion
(40%) of the risk was not localized, and high-risk areas (e.g.,
Windhoek West) were not always high-prevalence areas. There-
fore, the geographic targeting strategy that was employed did not
target several of the areas in Namibia, where the risk of acquiring
and transmitting HIV was the greatest.
Our results provide qualitative insights into the effect that
treatment had on the Namibian epidemic. Treatment would have
disrupted the risk ﬂow networks. In the targeted high-prevalence
areas that were important out- ﬂow risk-hubs, the structure of the
riskﬂow networks would have spatially dispersed the bene ﬁcial
effect of treatment on reducing transmission. This would have
decreased both localized transmission and transmission in many
other constituencies in Namibia. In the targeted high-prevalence
areas that were not important out- ﬂow risk-hubs, only localized
transmission would have decreased.
Our results have important policy implications for the design of
HIV elimination strategies in Namibia. The country has made
considerable progress in controlling its HIV epidemic. Progress
has been the result of political leadership, an effective community-
centered approach to interventions, and the strategic expansion of
treatment services. There are many preventative modalities that
are currently being used successfully in HIV interventions in
Namibia: e.g., pre-exposure prophylaxis, medical circumcision,
and condoms41. The Government began nation-wide imple-
mentation of the “Treat All ”policy in April 2017. This policy
recommends providing treatment to all HIV-infected individuals,
and removing treatment eligibility requirements. By 2017, the HIV
treatment program in Namibia was doing extremely well: ~83% ofall HIV-infected adults in Namibia were on treatment
13, a level of
coverage among the highest in Africa42. The Government ’sc u r -
rent goals are to reach UNAIDS ’2030 treatment targets for
elimination and to achieve treatment equity41with respect to
geography, age, and gender targets (especially for young women).
UNAIDS ’goals for 2030 are to have 95% of HIV-infected indi-
viduals diagnosed, 95% of the diagnosed on treatment, and 95% of
treated patients with viral suppression43. Our new understanding
of the generalized HIV epidemic in Namibia suggests that, in
order to eliminate HIV, control strategies will need to take into
account the riskiness, and vulnerability, of constituencies. To
design effective strategies, it will be necessary to identify the
current mobility network; therefore more recent data on CDRs in
Namibia need to be collected. Then, by expanding the metho-
dology that we have presented in this study to include treatment,
the current risk ﬂow networks and the risk hubs can be identi ﬁed.
We recommend developing strategies that preferentially target the
most important in- ﬂow and out- ﬂow risk hubs in the country.
Within in- ﬂow risk hubs, it is most important to target uninfected
residents; within out- ﬂow risk hubs, it is most important to target
HIV-infected residents.
There are limitations to our study, both with respect to the data
that we have used and the assumptions that we have made. We
have made the parsimonious assumption that HIV prevalence did
not change substantially between 2010 (the year the CDRs were
collected) and 2013 (the year the prevalence data were collected).
Although this assumption cannot be veri ﬁed, it is supported by the
fact that UNAIDS prevalence estimates for Namibia did not
change signi ﬁcantly over this three year time period38. CDRs arealways anonymized and therefore OD matrices cannot be dis-
aggregated on the basis of gender or any other demographic
factors44. In our study, as in all previous studies that have used
CDRs to model population-level mobility20–31, we assumed that
neither phone ownership, usage, or travel behavior differed sub-
stantially between genders. The data that we have presented have
shown that phone ownership and usage and length of trips did not
differ by gender. However, men traveled slightly more frequently
than women, and we do not know whether there were gender
differences in the origins and destinations of trips. Therefore, it is
possible that women and men had different mobility networks. If
true, this could potentially have changed which of the con-
stituencies were risk hubs. However, it would not have changed
our central conclusions: (i) that mobility has been extremely
important for the acquisition, transmission, and dispersal of HIV
in Namibia, and (ii) that our results present a new conceptual
understanding of generalized HIV epidemics in SSA. The CDRs
used to construct the OD matrix show that there was seasonal
variation in mobility. However, it is not necessary to model sea-
sonal changes in mobility as HIV transmission occurs throughout
the year. Even a substantial seasonal variation in transmission
would have a negligible impact (over a year) on prevalence; this is
because prevalence is an order of magnitude higher than inci-
dence. Finally, our study focuses on identifying spatial networks of
riskﬂows in a generalized epidemic where the vast majority of
transmission is through heterosexual sex. We have not modeled
spatial networks of risk ﬂows among men who have sex with men.
These networks could be included in future studies.
Many countries in SSA, including Namibia, have very mobile
borders45,46, therefore it is essential to develop more complex
spatial network models that can be used to evaluate the effect of
intra-country and inter-country mobility on generalized HIV epi-
demics throughout SSA. Many in- ﬂow and out- ﬂow hubs in
Namibia are close to the Angolan border (Fig. 5a). HIV prevalence
along the border (in adults aged 15 –49 years old) is substantially
lower in Angola (5 –6%)47than in Namibia (9 –32%). This suggests
that the out- ﬂow of risk from Namibia would have been greater
than the in- ﬂow of risk from Angola. Consequently, Namibia would
have had more of an impact on the HIV epidemic in Angola, than
Angola would have had on the HIV epidemic in Namibia.
We propose that high levels of mobility may be reducing the
effectiveness of current epidemic control strategies in SSA.
UNAIDS ’HIV elimination strategy is based, in large part, on the
assumption that a high coverage of treatment will reduce inci-
dence to an extremely low level. Four large-scale clinical trials
were set up to test this premise: the ANRS 12249 TasP study in
South Africa48, the SEARCH study in Kenya and Uganda49, the
HPTN 071 (PopART) study in South Africa and Zambia50, and
the Ya Tsie study in Botswana51. The ﬁrst three of these trials
failed to show a reduction in incidence, and the Ya Tsie study
showed a modest decrease of ~30%51. We suggest that the high
level of mobility in these countries could have been an important
factor that contributed to the failure of these trials. High inci-
dence rates in the areas of study could have been maintained due
to the importation of risk. This could have occurred due to
uninfected residents of communities in the study area visiting
communities outside the study area, or due to HIV-infected
residents of other communities visiting communities in the study
area. As HIV approaches elimination, mobility-driven transmis-
sion is likely to become increasingly important. This has already
been seen in elimination campaigns for polio52and malaria53;
high levels of mobility have led to the continuous introduction of
new infections into areas, where localized transmission had
already been stopped or reduced to extremely low levels. Mobility
may also become a substantial barrier to the elimination of HIV
in SSA.NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23051-w ARTICLE

Assessing gender bias in mobility . To determine whether there was gender bias
in mobile phone ownership or usage we analyzed data collected in 2012 in Namibia
in the 5thround of the Afrobarometer surveys36. To determine if there were gender
differences in travel behavior, we analyzed data (strati ﬁed by gender) from the 2013
Namibian Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS)37on the number of overnight
trips that had been made in the previous 12 months (between 2012 and 2013), andon the number of those trips that had lasted more than a month.
The Afrobarometer surveys are conducted in 37 African countries
36. The survey
utilizes a multistage clustered strati ﬁed sampling design to generate a representative
sample of the population, 18 years and older. It collects public opinion data on a
country ’s economy, governance, and society. The survey also collects data on
ownership and usage of mobile phones.
The 2013 NDHS utilized a two-stage cluster design to collect a representative
sample of Namibia ’s population37; clusters were georeferenced. Demographic and
behavioral data were collected from 14,499 individuals in 9849 households.
Participants who were 15 or older were tested for HIV infection. Each individual ’s
test results were linked to their demographic and behavioral data. The overall
response rate was high: 92% for women, 85% for men. Participation in HIV-testing
(in 15 –49 year olds) was also high: 83% for women, 74% for men.
HIV prevalence mapping . We used data from the 7731 individuals (aged 15 –49
years old) who were tested for HIV in the 2013 NDHS37to construct the gender-
speciﬁc prevalence maps for Namibia: Fig. 2b (women) and Fig. 2c (men). Pre-
valence was estimated, and maps constructed, using R v. 3.6.3 (packages “survey ”
and “sp”).
Calculating prevalence-connectivity matrices . We combined the OD matrix
with the prevalence data to construct the gender-speci ﬁc prevalence-connectivity
matrices. These matrices are shown in Fig. 2d (men) and Supplementary Fig. 2
(women). Each matrix was calculated by using the data in the OD matrix to
determine the time spent in each constituency. The prevalence data for womenwere used to construct the prevalence-connectivity matrix for men; the prevalence
data for men were used to construct the prevalence-connectivity matrix
for women.
Modeling spatial networks of risk ﬂows. To model these networks, we used three
sources of data: (i) the OD matrix, (ii) HIV prevalence data
37, and (iii) Census
data35.W ed e ﬁne risk as the probability that a new sex partner, who is a resident of
constituency i, is infected with HIV. If the population is not mobile, the risk to one
gender simply equals the prevalence of HIV in the opposite gender. If the popu-
lation is mobile, risk is calculated as described below.
The effective population size ð^niÞand the effective HIV prevalence ð^pi;^qiÞare
calculated. The effective population size ð^niÞis the expected number of individuals
present in a constituency at a given time. The effective HIV prevalence ð^pi;^qiÞis the
expected prevalence of HIV in men and women, respectively, in a constituency at a
given time.

pi,qirepresent the HIV prevalence in men and the HIV prevalence in women,
respectively, among the resident population of constituency i.
The total risk for women, ri, is then calculated; riis the probability that when a
woman, who is a resident of constituency i, meets a new male sex partner, he is
infected with HIV. The total risk for women in constituency iis deﬁned as follows:
ri¼∑

up the right-hand side of Eq. ( 5):

of constituency i, meets a new sex partner, she is in her home constituency, and the

is a resident of constituency j, meets a new sex partner while visiting constituency i,
and the partner is infected with HIV and a resident of constituency i.
vijrisk for women due to travel of HIV-infected men who are residents of
other constituencies . This is the probability that a woman, who is a resident of
constituency j, meets a new sex partner in her home constituency, and the partner
is infected with HIV and a resident of constituency i.

Note that inserting Eqs. ( 6,7,8) in Eq. ( 5) leads to Eq. ( 4). By swapping pforq
the risks for men can be calculated.
The relative impact of a risk on any speci ﬁc constituency can be de ﬁned in
terms of the relative impact on the total risk:
lrel
i¼li

vrel
ij¼vij
rj; ð11Þ
For instance, trel
ij=0.3 means that 30% of the risk in constituency jcomes from
constituency i, in terms of risk type t.
The risk networks are speci ﬁed in terms of the ﬂows of risk ( tijandvij) between
constituencies, where constituencies are the nodes in the network. A link from
constituency ito constituency jalways represents a ﬂow of risk from constituency i
to constituency j. Constituency iincreases the risk in constituency jby adding tij
and vijtorj. Clearly either tijorvijor both can be zero, if no ﬂow of risk occurs.
The risk ﬂow networks are weighted and directed networks. Weights are
speciﬁed in terms of the amount of risk that a link carries. The direction of risk
ﬂows is not always the same as the direction of the mobility ﬂuxes that generate
them. It is the same direction for v, which ﬂows from constituency ito constituency
jthrough individuals going from constituency ito constituency j(see the presence
of the term Aijin Eq. ( 8)). It is the opposite direction for t, which ﬂows from
constituency ito constituency jthrough individuals going from constituency jto
constituency i(see the presence of the term Ajiin Eq. ( 7)). In this latter case, risk in
constituency jincreases as its residents travel to other constituencies and risk
getting infected there.
Risk was calculated using Python 3 and standard libraries (numpy v1.19,
pandas v1.2).
Calculating risk importation and exportation . The in-strength of a node in a
weighted, directed network is the sum over the weights of its incoming links. We
deﬁnerisk importation as the in-strength of a node in the networks. Therefore, the
risk importation into each node is:
tIN
i¼∑
j≠itji;ð12Þ
vIN
i¼∑
j≠ivji:ð13Þ
The out-strength of a node in a weighted, directed network is the sum over the
weights of its outgoing links. We de ﬁnerisk exportation as the out-strength of a
node in the networks of relative impacts:

Notably, tOUT
i,vOUT
ican be larger than one. For instance, if constituency i
generates 60% of type- trisk of j, and 50% of type- trisk of k, then its risk
exportation, tOUT
iis equal to 1.1.
We calculated the risk ﬂows for each node/constituency in the networks; the
values are shown in Supplementary Table 3 for women and Supplementary Table 4
for men. These values were also used to construct the histograms shown in Fig. 3a,
4a and Supplementary Figs. 3 and 6.ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-23051-w
