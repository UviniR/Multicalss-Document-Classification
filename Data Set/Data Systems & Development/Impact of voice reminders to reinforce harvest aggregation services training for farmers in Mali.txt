 ii Summary  
The Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) funded a program me aimed at 
enhancing grain marketing support services in the Sikasso region of Mali. This 
program me was implemented by the Association Malienne d’Eveil au Développement 
Durable (AMEDD) between 2014 and 2017. This report contains the evaluation of the 
impact of selected components of the program me. This was achieved using two rounds 
of data collected before and after the implementation of the specific components of the 
program me. 
The overall aim of the AGRA -funded program me was to strengthen the capacity of 
aggregators (i.e. farmer cooperatives and private aggregators) to provide adapted 
services to smallholder grain farmers (maize, millet, sorghum and rice) and to link them 
to bulk  output buyers through contracts. A key aspect of the program me’s theory of 
change was that good -quality grains are a prerequisite for successfully linking 
smallholder farmers to specific bulk buyers. However, grain quality is influenced by pre-  
and post -harvest handling practices. Therefore, improving farmers’ knowledge of 
appropriate pre-  and post -harvest handling practices through training is important for a 
successful aggregator –farmer– buyer linkage.  
Based on this theory of change, farmers in all progr amme villages were trained using the 
training  of trainers approach. In addition to the program me’s theory of change that the 
training of farmers would help to reduce pre-  and post -harvest grain losses and improve 
grain quality, however, the Institute of St atistical, Social and Economic Research also 
hypothesi sed that a one- time face -to-face training would not be adequate to ensure 
effective application of what was learned, and that reminding farmers about what they 
had learned during training at specific periods when such knowledge should be applied 
would have an impact over and above a one- off training.  
Based on the above hypothesis, all AMEDD -targeted farmers in 99 program me villages 
located in the Koutiala, Sikasso and Yorosso c ercle s (subregions or dist ricts)  of the 
Sikasso region received the same training on pre- and post -harvest grain handling and 
quality management. Following the randomi sed control trial design, 44 villages were 
randomly assigned to treatment : in these villages a random sample of the AMEDD -
targeted farmers also received specific mobile phone reminders based on the training 
module. The reminders were sent at the time when such knowledge needed to be 
applied. The rest of the 55 villages serve d as the control group , and farmers in these 
villages did not receive any reminders .  
The random sample of AMEDD -targeted farmers in each village consisted of an average 
of 14 (between 12 and 15) trained- farmer households, yielding a total sample size of 
1,434 (control = 821; treated = 613) upon whic h this impact evaluation is based. This  
impact evaluation therefore focuses on the questions: what is the added impact on pre-  
and post -harvest behavio ur and outcomes of mobile phone reminders about face- to-face 
training received?  
Specifically, we have evaluated the impact of the mobile phone training reminders about 
pre- and post -harvest grain handling and management activities on the following 
indicators: time of grain harvesting and harvesting costs, sale of grains through iii aggregation centr es, adoption of improved storage methods, pre-  and post -harvest grain 
losses, grain commerciali sation, food crop income, and household food security. This 
has been achieved using the difference- in-difference estimation approach.  
The key results can be summari sed as follows:  
• The mobile phone reminders had a significant impact on the timing of the grain 
harvest ; 
• The mobile phone reminders had a significant positive impact on the adoption of 
improved grain storage methods ; 
• The mobile phone reminders had no impact on the likelihood of selling grains 
through aggregation centr es; 
• The mobile phone reminders lowered the incidence of pre- harvest grain losses 
significantly but had no impact on post -harvest grain losses ; and 
• The mobile phone reminders reduced the incidence of hunger significantly but 
had no impact on food crop incomes .  iv Content s

 1 1. Introduction  
Although agriculture remains the main form of livelihood for most households in Sub-
Saharan Africa (SSA), farmers in the Sahel  region in particular , conten d with more 
precarious agricultural production conditions leading to even lower yields than the SSA 
average . For instance, while the average yield for cereals in SSA was 1,303.6 kilograms 
per hectare for the period 2010 –2014, Mali recorded 433.7 kilograms per hectare for the 
same period (FAOSTAT 2017). Apart from the unfavo urable weather conditions, t his 
situation is attributable to a myriad of problems relating to poor access to agricultural 
inputs, poor post-harvest  and grain quality management, poor organi sation al skills  of 
farmers, limited credit access, and underdeveloped output markets .  
Agricultural activity in Mali, especially in Sikasso ( a region that is kno wn as the 
‘breadbasket ’ of Mali) , is dominated by cereal production (maize, sorghum, millet and 
rice),  although cotton is by far the most commerciali sed crop . Notwithstanding the 
enormous potential of cereal cultivation in the region, productivity remains low, with the 
country consequently importing large volumes of cereals.  Agricultural production in the 
Sikasso region is characteri sed by smallholder farmers with farm units dispersed 
throughout the rural space. Existing cooperatives are weak and not effective at providing 
the desired services to their members. Since  opportunities are poorly structured 
downstream , smallholder farmer s’ access to markets is limited, and t here are no contract 
relationships between producers and buyers.  
Farme rs in Mali consider post-harvest crop losses an important problem , particularly 
because of the threat to their food security ( AGRA 2014) . Although grain production in 
Mali still has great potential, in spite of the challenges, access to certain types of markets 
is hampered by poor grain quality and low output . Adequate training and information on 
pre- and post -harvest crop handling and aggregation is lacking, resulting in poor -quality 
grains and low prices , which cons equently affect farmer s’ incomes . 
To ensure sustainable transformation  of agriculture the Sikasso region in the face of 
these constraints , the need for a coordinated action in the areas of production, grain 
quality management, processing and marketing services  is paramount . In response to 
this, the Association Malienne d’Eveil au Développement Durable (Malian Association for 
Sustainable Development ; AMEDD ) received a grant from the Alliance for a Green 
Revolution in Africa (AGRA) in 2013 to implement agriculture- related interventions in 
Mali’s largest grain- producing region , Sikasso. The interve ntions are aimed at 
addressing some of the key constraints faced in agriculture in Sikasso , which include 
poor access to agricultural inputs, poor post-harvest  and grain quality management, poor 
organi sation al skills  of farmers, limited credit access, and underdeveloped output 
markets. The overall expected outcome is increased smallholder farmers’  incomes in the 
region.  
This report  provides an analysis of the impact of  mobile phone reminders about pre- and 
post-harves t grain handling and aggregation training on smallholder farmer behavio ur 
and outcomes in the study region. Based on the stipulated  theory of change, we 
compare changes in key impact and outcome indicators between the treatment and 
control group s. Since  our population of interest is all farmers who received training on 
various aspects of pre-  and post -harvest grain handling, our overall objective is to 2 analy se the impact of mobile phone reminder s about key training messages on pre- and 
post-harvest  manageme nt and aggregation behavio ur, as well as on selected outcomes , 
in the Sikasso region of Mali. Specifically, t he study aims to answer  the following 
research questions:  
• Will training reminders about pre-  and post -harvest grain handling and 
management activities lead to increased demand for related inputs and services?  
• Will training reminders about optimal grain harvesting time lead to change in 
grain harvesting costs?  
• Will training reminders about the availability of sales  contract  arrangement s have 
a positive impact on selling grains through aggregation centr es? 
• Will training reminders about recommended grain storage methods have a 
positive impact on grain storage decisions  and the adoption of improved storage 
methods ? 
• Will training reminders about pre- and post -harvest grain handling and 
management lead to a reduction in crop losses?  
• Will training reminders about good grain handling and quality management lead 
to increased commerciali sation and higher grain prices received  by farmers?  
• Will training reminders have an impact on the cost of market transactions?  
• Will training reminder s have a positive impact on farmers’ incomes and the food 
security of their households ? 
The rest of the report is structured as follows. The programme intervention, the 
underlying theory of change, and the research hypotheses are described in section 2. 
Section 3 presents the context of the study, with timelines following in s ection 4. We then 
present the evaluation design, methods and implementation in section 5. Section 6 
details the programme design, methods and implementation. The impact analysis and 
results are presented in section 7, which is followed by a general discussion of the 
threats to internal and external validity and the key less ons in section 8. Finally, s ection 9 
outlines the specific findings for policy and recommendations for fruitful future research.  
2. Intervention, theory of change and research hypothes es 
2.1  Programme  intervention  
The AGRA -approved programme  intervention was ai med at increasing smallholder 
farmers’ participation in factor and product markets via their linkages to aggregators. The programme engaged with two types of aggregators: cooperatives and private aggregators. The cooperatives are essentially farmer organi sations that aim at providing 
specific services to their members. In areas where cooperatives were not available, 
private aggregators were identified and selected to provide similar services to farmers. 
The two groups of aggregators were expected to provide the same range of services to 
farmers to whom they were linked. The strategy of linking farmers to aggregators is 
expected to help reduce transaction cost s associated with smallholder output marketing.  
The interventions were expected to:  
• Strengthen the c apacities (organi sational, technical and institutional) of 
cooperatives to provide production, post -harvest and marketing services to 
smallholder farmers ; 3 • Strengthen the capacities (technical and business) of private operators to provide 
production, post -harvest and marketing services to smallholder farmers ; and 
• Improve smallholder farmers’ output marketing by developing business contract 
linkages between aggregators and buyers . 
These interventions involved activities at the cooperative, private agro- enterprise and 
smallholder farmer levels. The activities at the first two levels were largely the same,  
except for the difference in the service provider. The following key activities were  
undertaken as part of the intervention:  
• Training of cooperatives and private aggregators  in organi sational management, 
collective marketing, contracting and bulk purchasing of inputs, and post-harvest 
handling and quality management ; 
• Training of farmers in cooperative principles, contracting and post -harvest 
handling and quality management ;  
• Establishing aggregation centr es; and  
• Facilitating contractual relationships between cooperatives/private aggregators 
and buyers.  
The interventions were based on aggregating farmers around cooperatives and private 
aggregators (in communities where there are no existing cooperatives) and thereby 
providing a platform for access to more structured and rel iable factor and product market  
services. All farmers in our population of interest received face -to-face training t hrough 
the training of trainers approach. In addition , a random sample of the trained farmers 
also received mobile phone reminders on selected training modules during selected 
periods of the agricultural production cycle ( section 5) . The content of the reminders was  
related to pre- and post-harvest grain handling and quality management , as well as 
market ing activities (Appendix B). The impact evaluation is on the mobile phone 
reminders component of the intervention  (section 6.1.4). 
2.1.1  Theory of change  
Our theory of change centred on raising smallholder farmer s’ incomes and i mproving 
their food security status by reinforcing lessons learned  during face- to-face training about 
grain aggregation, sales contracting, pre-  and post -harvest handling and grain quality 
management using mobile phone reminders. AMEDD identified a number of problems confronting grain farmers in the Sikasso region, which include losses in grain quantity 
and quality due to poor pre-  and post -harvest management, poor access to appropriate 
post-harvest inputs, poor organi sation al skills  of farmers, and the lac k of access to better 
grain output markets. Some of these problems have resulted in increased transaction 
costs and reduced grain market participation, which subsequently leads to low farm ers’ 
incomes and high food insecurity. AMEDD therefore put together a number of activities – 
including farmer training –  aimed at addressing these challenges, with the overarching 
goal of increasing farmer s’ incomes and reducing household food insecurity.   
AMEDD’s activities included: (i) t raining of cooperatives and private aggregators in 
organi sational management, collective marketing, contracting, bulk purchasing of inputs, 
pre- and post -harvest handling and grain quality management; (ii) t raining of farmers in 
cooperative principles, collective marketing (grain aggregation), sales contracting, 
collective bulk input buying, pre-  and post -harvest handling and quality management. 
AMEDD’s theory of change is that providing pre-  and post -harvest grain handling and 4 quality management training to aggregators and farmers wi ll reduce losses in grain 
quality and quantity, allowing farmers to access higher market niches.  
In addition to AMEDD’s assumption that training would lead to behaviou ral change , 
which would translate into impact on key outcomes , we argue, based on the theory of 
change , that reinforcing training lessons through reminders enhances knowledge 
retention and subsequent application, all else being equal ( VanLehn 1996; Kim et al. 
2013) . Therefore, the impact that our study seeks to evaluate is based on the 
assum ption that a one- time face -to-face training in pre-  and post -harvest handling and 
quality management, and related activities , will not be enough to ensure that farmers 
fully assimilate and apply the knowledge. Suppose one is able to remind farmers at 
speci fic periods when they need to apply what they learned during the face- to-face 
training, will this increase adoption rates over and above receiving training only? 
Fortunately, general developments in information and communication technology ( ICT) 
(as well a s increased penetration of mobile phones among farmers) , and, in particular, 
mobile phone voice reminders , makes it possible to test this hypothesis. Our theory of 
change is that the reminders increase the likelihood of adoption of better pre-  and post -
harvest practices. Why could this be the case? The psychology literature ( Schmidt and 
Bjork 1992 ; VanLehn 1996 ; Kim et al. 2013)  suggests that repetition matters for retention 
of what is learned, and that spacing out repetitions  has an even greater effect , such that 
allowing time between training and the reminders, rather than ma ssing repetitions, works 
best. This constitutes an important foundation for this study ( Figure 1).  
The actual training content covered pre-  and post -harvest activities. We therefore expect 
reminders about knowledge acquired through training to have an impact first on farmer 
behavio ur, second on crop output and marketing,  and finally on smallholder farmer s’ 
incomes  and household food security. The i mpact on farmer behaviou r may be observed 
through indicators such as harvesting time, harvesting cost and an increased likelihood 
of using improved storage methods. The impact on crop output and marketing is 
captured using indicators such as reduction in pre - and post -harvest grain losses, 
increased output commerciali sation, and selling through aggregation centr es. 
Mobile phone reminders of training on pre-  and post -harvest handling and grain quality 
management are expected to promote farmers’ uptake of enhanced pre-  and post -
harvest management practices , such as timely harvest and the adoption of post -harvest 
technology in the form of improved storage methods. These are expected to reduce 
grain losses (Kum bhakar and Bokusheva 2009) and therefore mak e increased volumes 
and better -quality grains available to the household. While reductions in quantity loss es 
are expected to increase marketable surplus , improved grain quality is expected to 
attract higher grai n prices. The combined effect of increased marketable grain surplus 
and higher grain prices is expected to result in higher food crop incomes for farmers and 
reduced food insecurity. 5 Figure 1: Theory of change: Impact of mobile phone reminders

 6 Further, we expect mobile phone reminders of farmer s’ training on cooperative principles 
and collective marketing (grain aggregation) to promote sales through aggregation 
centr es, which bene fit from higher prices as a result of collective bargaining and which 
could lead to higher farmer s’ incomes. Collective selling through aggregators 
(cooperatives and private aggregators) is expected to reduce the cost of transactions 
such as search and inf ormation cost. We expect farmers to enter sales contracts with 
aggregators following mobile phone reminders of training on sales contracting. Sales 
contracts are a major means of reducing the incidence of low and volatile prices 
associated with grains duri ng the harvest season. It is therefore expected that 
guaranteed prices through sale contracts would have a positive impact on farmer s’ 
incomes and subsequently reduce household food insecurity.  
In the medium to long  term, the intervention could increase farm investment as farmers 
get guaranteed and stable output markets, which allow them to plan more effectively and 
efficiently. However, we do not evaluate this impact because of the relatively short time 
span between treatment and endline data collection; we expect such benefit to start 
accruing.  
The rationale for these expected results is that a more structured market, resulting from the smallholder –aggregator –buyer linkage, helps to overcome underdeveloped input and 
product markets and leads to higher adoption rates. The assumption is that farmers are 
willing and have the incentive to sell through aggregation centr es, and that these centr es 
are available at a reasonable distance from farmers. Even then, we are not oblivious to 
the issue of side -selling and contract non- adherence (Minot and Sawyer 2016) ; farmers 
often compare the marginal gains from selling through aggregation centr es with those 
available by selling through other markets , and then choose the option they believe 
optimi ses their returns, at least in the short  run. Our key informant interviews suggest 
that this is common.  
The expected impacts could be threatened by a number of factors. F irst, there is the 
threat of influence or sabotage from established middlemen/women. There is also the 
possibility that farmers divert inputs away from targeted crops or even sell these inputs in  
the market. If this happens, the expected impact of the program me would not be 
observed. The impact of the programme also depends on the timeliness of factor input availability from aggregators. If inputs are not available to farmers at the time when they 
should be applied,  then farmers will effectively have ‘void’  contracts with aggregation 
centr es and adequate volumes will not be available to meet contracts. The risk of 
product diversion may not necessarily be a price issue. If, for example, aggregators do 
not collect produce on time , this increases the side- selling risk.  
Additionally, two more issues pose threats to the program me not being successful in 
achieving its core goals , and these relate to the fact that it is grain which is the channel 
through which farmer s’ incomes could be increased in the study area. The first issue 
surrounds the goal of reducing post -harvest grain losses  by farmers . Estimates of these 
losses suggest they are already very low, about 5  per cent  (AGRA 2014 ), and , although 
driving down the current levels is laudable,  it may be difficult to see a significant impact 
in the short term. The second issue relates to the goal of raising smallholder farmers’  
incomes through grain market participatio n. Ex-ante, grain market participation is 
generally low, with less than half of all grain farmers selling any output. Thus, it could 7 take some time for this to change, meaning that we may not be able to detect an impact 
for the period during which we have observed the farmers.  
In sum, the theory of change is that , since all farmers and aggregators received the 
same level and quality of training, reinforcement thr ough the add -on intervention of 
mobile phone reminders will encourage application of knowledge among treated farmers 
(those who received mobile phone reminders) over and above what is observed among 
control farmers (those who received face- to-face training only). This should lead to lower 
crop losses among the treatment group compared with the control group, which will further lead to higher grain  value, and increased household incomes, all other things 
being equal . 
2.1.2  Research hypotheses  
Good -quality grains have higher market value and attract large buyers such as the World 
Food Program me. Poor pre- and post -harvest handling and quality management , 
however, threaten access to such higher value markets , in addition to reducing the 
overall reali sed grain output. An important component of the proposed program me is 
therefore to provide farmers with the requisite knowledge that could help to  overcome 
the challenges above. All farmers in our study sample receive d the same relevant  
knowledge in terms of the content and also the quality of the training through face- to-
face sessions.  Our hypothesis is that sending mobile phone reminders to farmers before, 
during and after harvesting – at the time when they need to apply the knowledge learned 
from the training – has an added impact on  farmers’ adoption of effective pre- and post -
harvest activities and aggregation services , subsequently  reducing pre-and post -harvest 
crop losses and increas ing crop aggregation beyond the rate achievable through face- to-
face training only . 
We expect the reminders to have an impact on grain harvesting cost. This is because the 
training also focused on timely harvesting i n order to avoid crop losses . Based on the 
training modules, we sent specific reminders on appropriate harvest ing procedures 
(Appendix B). We therefore expect an impact on the cost of harvesting. It could increase 
due to increased investments in harvesting  procedures. On the other hand, efficiency 
gains could lead to cost savings if farmers use hired labour less frequently or choose to 
harvest themselves because they believe that hired labou r would not know the correct 
harvesting methods.  
Post-harvest technology adoption is an important determinant of post -harvest losses 
(Kumbhakar and Bokusheva 2009; Tefera  et al. 2011 ). The AMEDD training modules 
had specific sections on type of material and m ethods to use for storage in order to 
minimi se losses . We therefore expect the timely reminders on recommended grain 
storage to have a positive impact on the adoption of improved storage methods.  This 
should also increase the likelihood of storing grains as opposed to selling soon after 
harvest.  
Collective selling  through aggregation centr es because of sale contract s is one of the 
major ways the proposed program me could improve farmer market participation and 
raise smallholder  farmers’  incomes. Yet the literature suggests that non- adherence to 
contracts and side- selling of output is not uncommon (Dawes  et al. 2009; Narayanan 
2012) . If the aggregation model is working well, then we expect more farmers in the 8 treatment group to sell their grains through aggregation centr es as well as receive 
related services from aggregators. Even if they do not store their grains directly at 
aggregation centr es, they should use more improved methods of storage at home in 
order to be able to meet the quality standards demanded by aggregators linked to ‘big 
buyers’.    
Given the explanations above,  our overall hypothesis can be stated as follows.  Mobile 
phone reminders about pre- and post-harvest handling and quality management, and  
related services , lead to reduc ed crop losses, improved grain quality and value , 
increased incomes,  and reduced  household food insecurity . If we let T( 0) denote farmers 
in the control group (i.e. farmers who received only face- to-face training) , and T(1) those 
in the treatment group (i.e. farmers who, in addition to the face-to-face training , also 
received mobile phone reminders) , then our hypothesis is a test of the difference in the 
outcomes between the two groups : that is, T(1) – T(0).  
3. Context  
3.1 Country background  
Mali is a lan d-locke d country in West Africa, covering a land area of about 1.2 million 
square kilometres  with an estimated population of about 18.5 million as at 2017 (World 
Bank 2018 ). About 90  per cent  of the people in Mali live in the southern region,  close to 
the Niger and Senegal rivers, far from the Sahara Desert . The population of Mali 
comprises several sub- Saharan ethnic groups , the largest being the Bambara ethnic 
group, which account s for about 37 per cent  of the population. Although the official 
language of Mali is French, about 80  per cent  of the population speak Bambara (the 
main local language spoken in the study region) .  
The economy of Mali is heavily dependent on agriculture, with the rural population mostly 
engaged in semi -subsistence agriculture. The economic environment i s characteri sed by 
weak economic growth and per capita income combined with high unemployment and 
high poverty rate. Mali has one of the lowest standards of human development in the 
world , with a Human Development Index rating of less 0.5 ( Figure 2), and is classified 
among the world’s 10 poorest nations.  
Mali’s potential wealth lies in mining and the production of agricultural commodities, 
including l ivestock and fish. The total size of Mali’s economy in 2013 was about US$10.9 
billion. Annual average real gross domestic product (GDP ) growth over the period 2010 –
14 was 3.5 per cent , with 2011 –13 seeing even lower average real growth rates ( Table 
1). During the period of the socio- political crisis  in 2012, growth stagnated, with the 
secondary and tertiary sectors experiencing negative growth rate s of -2.9 per cent  
and -6.7 per cent , respectively. These were offset , however,  by the dynamism of the 
agriculture sector, which grew by 8.6  per cent , sufficient to cancel out the fall in the other 
sectors.

In order to consolidate the economic gains made by the country and address the 
perennial food insecurity issues, several interventions have been implemented by 
government and non- governmental organi sations. Most of the interventions focus on 
three main outcomes: increased productivity, food security and increased incomes. In 
many cases , these outcomes are to be achieved through access to agricultural inputs, 
training on input use , post-harvest  practices and price information. For example, AGRA 
alone has invested more than U S$17.5 million in Mali, mainly in the Sikasso region, to 
build the capacity of farmer -based organi sations (FBOs) to access improved planting 
materials, adopt integrated soil fertility technologies and to enhance th e market power of 
smallholders.  
3.2 Background  of the study area  
Mali has eight administrative regions. The AMEDD -funded AGRA intervention is being 
implemented in the Sikasso region, which  is in the south of the country. By land area, the 0.0000.0500.1000.1500.2000.2500.3000.3500.4000.450
1990 2000 2010 2012 2014 2015 2016 2017Human Development Index value  
Year10 Sikasso region represents only about 6 per cent  of Mali’s land  area, but has a much 
higher population density than the country average, accommodating over 18 per cent  of 
Mali’s population, according to the 2009 census ( INSTAT 2011 ). At the subregional level, 
the Sikasso region is made up of seven districts known as cercl es. The AMEDD 
intervention is being implemented in three of these cercles: Koutiala, Sikasso and 
Yorosso.  
The Sikasso region is considered the ‘breadbasket’ of Mali , mainly due to its relatively 
more favourable  climatic conditions in a rather dry country , where the agriculture 
production is largely rainfed. For example, while Mali as a whole usually experiences an 
annual rainfall average of about 540 –740 millimetres (as low as 50 –250 millimetres in 
the Saharan  north of the country), Sikasso – with its Sudano -Guinean climate – 
experiences a mean annual rainfall of about 1,200 millimetres . Consequently, agriculture 
(crops and livestock production) is the main economic livelihood activity in Sikasso, although trade and artisanal gold mining are also important economic livelihood options. 
Maiz e, sorghum, millet and rice dominate the food crop sector , while cotton is the major 
cash crop.  
4. Timelines  
The activity timeline  for the study  is shown in  Figure 3. Sampling, based on information 
received from AMEDD, took place in  February  2015 , after which baseline data collection 
followed in April 2015 . Although AMEDD processes and interventions took place 
between May 2014 and March 2017,  the relevant training activities for which our mobile 
phone reminder impact evaluation is based actually took place between November 2015 
and February 2016 . There was a stakeholder workshop in October 2015  with t he aim of 
interrogating results obtained from the baseline survey. We also received input for 
subsequent  refine ment of the endline quantitative instrument . Stakeholder engagement 
activities  followed in June 2016 prior to  the implementation of the mobile phone reminder 
component of the study . Mobile phones were procured and distribut ed to farmers in 
September 2016. During the distribution of the phones, we also conducted a few  focus 
group discussions to help understand some of the baseline quantitative resul ts. This also 
provided some information towards the implementation of the endline quantitative 
survey. The endline survey was conducted  in April 2017 .

 11 5. Evaluation: design, methods and implementation  
5.1 Evaluation design  (including randomi sation ) 
5.1.1  Design  
The sample population for the impact evaluation is made up of  farmers who received the 
interventions implemented by AMEDD in three cercles of the Sikasso region of Mali: 
Koutiala, Sikasso and Yorosso. The coverage villages within these cercles , 99 villages in 
all, form the clusters for the randomi sation. All AMEDD project farmers who were 
registered as part of the intervention in the 99 villages received training on pre- and post -
harvest grain quality management. After the training, 44 villages were randomly assigned 
to treatment and the rest to control. Therefore, t he assigned experimental arms are:  
• T(0): Control –villages where farmers received only face- to-face training.  
• T(1): Treatment –villages where farmer received mobile phones and reminders 
after training.  
Our power calculations indicated that drawing 12 households per cluster would provide 
adequate power for detecting impact based on the stated assumpt ions in section 5.2. 
However, we targeted 15 households per cluster i n order to be insulated against the risk 
of attrition reducing the power of our statistical tests . 
5.1.2  Randomisation 
The randomi sation followed two stages. At the first stage,  we obtained a list of 99 
villages that received training from AMEDD. We then randomly assigned each of the 
villages to one of the two arms: T(0) and T(1). The distribution of the villages by cercles 
is shown in Table 2. Across the cercles, the distribution was consistent with what the 
implementer made av ailable for the study – about 31% in Koutiala, 29% in Sikasso and 
39% in Yorosso. The random assignment was done together with the implementer using 
the Stata software. At the second stage,  we listed households in the 99 selected villages 
in the three c ercles. Finally, 15 households were randomly drawn from each of the 
villages that had been listed.

5.2 Sample size determination  
The sample size used for this study was arrived at by undertaking a power analysis 
based on ex-ante assumptions and ex-post realisations about key parameters. The key 
assumptions that informed our power analysis and consequent  sample size were as 
follows : 
• Level of significance ( α) = 0.05  
• Intra-cluster correlation ( ICC) = 0.03 12 • Clusters per treatment = 44  
• Cases per cluster = 12  
• Effect size = 0.20  
Thes e assumptions gave 80  per cent  power, meaning that there is 0.80  probability th at 
the impact estimates  based on the selected sample will find a statistica lly significant 
difference when such a difference actually exists. AMEDD trained 29 ,700 farmers in all  
99 program me villages (or clusters). We have used all these 99 villages for the mobile 
phone reminder experim ent (55 for control and 44 for treatment). We oversampled at 
baseline, achieving a total sample size of 1,483 ( 15 households per cluster in 97 cases, 
12 per cluster in 1 case, and 16 per cluster in another  case). The sample dropped to 
1,481 during the endline survey (12 and 14 in a village each, and 15 in the rest of the 97 
villages). However, our analysis is based on 1,434 households  (821 control and 613 
treatment ) because we excluded 47 households which  did not receive the full 
complement of the mobil e phone voice messages ( 196 messages in all) . We have 
verified that the  households that did not receive the messages are not  systematically 
different from those that  did (Table A2 in Appendix A ). 
Some of the assumptions outlined above hold for some of the indicators at endline so 
that we still have adequate power . However, the post -intervention ICCs are higher for 
some of our indicators , meaning that for those indicators ( Table A1 in Appendix A) our 
study is not adequately powered to detect an impact . For example,  with an  ex-post 
average cluster size of 14 and an ICC of 0.008 for the post -harvest loss indicator , the 
study is adequately powered to detect the impact of the reminders  on post -harvest 
losses. For food crop income, however, we have ex-post ICC of 0.462 , which means that 
our study of the impact of the reminders  on food crop income is underpowered.  This 
should be borne in mind when interpreting some of the results.  
5.3 Survey methodology  
5.3.1  Sampling  
The sampling protocol was as follows. AMEDD furnis hed the research team with a list of 
all eligible villages together with the list of aggregators who serve the program me 
villages. Since a full list of farmers to be served was not available, this was generated 
through a listing exercise in each village in collaboration with AMEDD and the 
aggregators (private and cooperative). After the careful listing of all farmers in each 
village, trained research assistants randomly selected 15 members from each selected 
aggregator using Microsoft E xcel©. Before taking the random draw, the list generated 
was always validated by the leaders of the aggregators to ensure that it  contained only 
members of the cooperative or private aggregator -linked farmers.  The 99 villages 
comprised 60 villages served by coo peratives and 39 by private aggregators. The target 
of 15 members from each aggregator  was achieved in 96 villages; 13 members were 
enrolled in one village, and 14 in two villages.  The final sample thus consists of 862 and 
572 farmers reached through cooperatives and private aggregators, respectively.  
5.3.2  Data collection  
Two rounds  of data were collected for this study using an identical quantitative data 
survey instrument –  at baseline and endline. The baseline data collection was 
undertaken in April and May  2015 , while the endline data was collected in March and 13 April 2017. The survey instrument used focused on the farming activity of farm 
households. Although some household non- farm activity data were  included in the 
instrument, the emphasis was on data rel ating to agricultural production, harvesting and 
marketing. Particular attention was paid to getting information on farmers’  incomes and 
crop losses – two key impact indicators. The period for the survey was chosen so that it 
preceded the start of the rainy season when farmers are busiest.  
The actual surveys were led by researchers from Groupe de Recherche en Économie 
Théorique et Appliqu ée (GRE ThA) with supervision and guidance from the Institute of 
Statistical, Social and Economic Research ( ISSER ). Before each of the surveys, 
enumerators were trained over a number of days. The objective of the training was to 
ensure that enumerators had a good and common understanding of the questionnaire. 
As part of the training, the enumerators undertook role- play exercises. Additionally, there 
was pre- testing of the questionnaire, which involved administering it to selected farmers 
in a community outside the program me area. Following the  pre-tests, the team organi sed 
debriefing session s, where the concerns and challenges encountered during the pre-
tests were discussed. The actual survey started immediately after the training. Each of the supervisors and their team was assigned a subregion (or cercle) . 
6. Program me implementation  and internal validity  
6.1 Programme  implem entation  
Details of the ex-ante program me intervention are given  in section 2.1. Here, we focus 
more on actual implementation issues. The implementation spanned a three- year period 
covering May 2014 to March 2017 in three cercles  of the Sikasso region: Koutiala, 
Sikasso and Yorosso. A  core component of the program me was the training of 
aggregators and farmers , the main goal being to  equip them  to reduce the level of grain 
losses, increase grain quality, increase the value of output  sold, and thereby increase 
smallholder farmer s’ incomes.  Apart  from the goals of the AMEDD program me specified 
in section 2.1,  ISSER funded an add- on intervention,  which had the goal of reinforcing  
the training that farmers had received by sending mobile phone reminders to a randomly 
selected group of farmers.  
The implementation of the Development of Agricultural Marketing Support Services 
program me had the  principal goal of improving  smallholder farmers’ incomes by reducing 
transaction costs for smallholder farmers in the Sikasso region of Mali through reduction 
in post -harvest crop losses and the sale of crops through aggregation centr es 
(cooperatives and private companies). The program me had three main components, with 
an add- on (fourth) component introduced and funded by ISSER. We highlight the various 
activities implemented under each component below . 
6.1.1  Strengthening  cooperatives ’ organisational , technical and institutional 
capacities to provide production, post -harvest and marketing services to 
smallholder farmers  
Activities implemented for this component of the programme targeted cooperatives and 
private aggregators operating in the intervention region. Overall, 50 cooperatives took part in this component  of the program me. The main activities undertaken included : 
• profiling of FBOs  14 • training leaders of FBOs on six modules , which were:  
o cooperative management  
o strategies for input supply  
o contract agreement and marketing  
o post-harvest management and cereal storage  
o funding strategies  
o basic accounting  
• training of farmers ’ trainers  and producers on three modules , which were:  
o cooperative principles  
o contract agreement and marketing  
o post-harves t management and cereal storage  
• business plan s funding by the matching grant  
• exchange visits between stakeholders.  
All cooperative farmers selected for the intervention received training through the t raining 
of trainers approach . This means that farmer leaders and extension agents were trained, 
and these individuals  then trained far mers at the cooperative level. The training lasted for 
two days per module. In all, over 7,000 farmers from the selected cooperatives received 
training over the period of the intervention. The total matching grants advanced to 
cooperatives over  the period amounted to FCFA (Franc Communauté Financière 
Africaine ) 35 million  (about US$60,209 ) in the form of equipment and institutional 
strengthening. According to the programme implementation report by AMEDD, the total 
volume of 2,420 ton nes of cereals sold through aggregation centr es was valued at FCFA 
235 million  (US$ 404,407 ).1 In addition, the reported total volume of cereals sold under 
contracts was 1,166 tonnes.  
Implementation of this component also involved a field trip to Burkina Faso involving 23 
people . This was for participants to acquire practical experience with the cereal storage 
system, and to assess the level of adhesion and satisfaction of stakeholders, as well as 
the level of engagement in the process by the Burkinabe authorities , in order to make 
necessary recommendations to the Malian authorities. During the trip, some cooperatives and private aggregators participated in a knowledge- sharing session with 
local farmer organi sations , micro -finance institutions and local agricultural chambers.  
6.1.2  Strengthening the technical and business capacities of private operators to 
provide production, post -harvest and marketing services to smallholder farmers  
As there were no functional cooperatives in some of the villages where the program me 
was targeted, AMEDD decided to work with private aggregators  in order to reach farmers  
in these villages . The private aggregators were chosen by AMEDD based on their 
capacity in terms of available infrastructure (including aggregation centr e facilities) and 
their willingness to participate in the program me. Seven private aggregators were 
selected and trained on supply and stock management, business plan development, negotiation and credit management. The private aggregators worked with  farmer 
cooperatives. Over the period of i mplementation, 4,200 farmers joined private

 15 aggregation centr es. These farmers were also trained using the same approach as the 
cooperative farmers on post -harvest management, contract agreement and marketing. 
Workshops were organi sed where private aggregators were linked to farmer s, as well as 
cooperation established between the cooperatives and the private aggregators.  During 
these workshops and training program mes, contracts were signed between farmer 
cooperatives and private aggregators.  
6.1.3  Improving small holder farmers ’ agricultural output  marketing  
This co mponent of the program me involved training sessions on processing techniques 
and output marketing. The training program mes were also aimed at foster ing 
partnerships between farmers and local cereal -processing women. Over the period, 46 
women benefited directly from these partnerships. Trade fair s were also held in Sikasso 
and Koutiala as part of  this component of the program me. The fairs encouraged 
interactions among female processors for the purpose of knowledge -sharing towards 
grain quality impro vement . The c ereal trade fairs also provide d opportunit ies for 
producers, private operators and processors  to make transacti ons. During the fair, 1.2 
tonnes of cereals were sold, valued at FCFA 750,000 (appr oximately US$1,200) . 
Another component of the above program me was focused on negotiation skills. T hree 
separate pre- harvest negotiation events were organi sed during the three- year 
intervention period. These events were geared at gathering information on the demand 
for cereals in order to effectively forecast demand and ensure effective output sales. 
Overall, 19 co ntracts were signed for 848 ton nes of cereal over the intervention period.  
6.1.4  Mobile phone and post -harvest reminder messages  
This component of the program me was an add- on intervention introduced and funded by 
ISSER. The add-on intervention was implemented over a period of five months 
(September 2016 to January 20 17). In all, 808 m obile phones were procured and 
distributed to farmers located in a randomly selected number of treatment villages . 
These phones were needed for farmers to receive training reminders. The reminder 
messages were designed by AMEDD , ISSER  and GRE ThA. Implementation of this 
component of the programme started with the setting up of a platform that enable d the 
sending of SMS ( text) and voice messages. The platform was  then integrated with 
mobile operators in Mali –  Orange/Malitel as a local gateway for voice and SMS 
message dissemination. The messages were translated into Bambara and then  
uploaded to the platform, and subsequently sent to the farmers. There was close 
supervision and facilitation of the process to ensure the smooth running of the platform to 
deliver customi sed messages to the selected famers. There wer e also training sessions  
for selected staff from ISSER  and partners , on how to send messages to selected 
farmers.  
In all, 8  customi sed messages were sent to 704 farmers located in the 44 treatment 
villages over the intervention period.  The messaging period was divided into three: pre-
harvest, harvest and post -harvest. Note that the messages were period- specific,  in the 
sense that they related to the activities that farmers were expected to be carrying out at 
the time the messages were sent (Appendix B ). There were 196 messages involving 92 
farmers spread across 11 villages that were not delivered for technical reasons . We 
therefore excluded the 92  farmers from the impact evaluation —they are not part of the 
612 farmers in the 44 villages used as the tre atment group. We have verified that the 16 excluded farmers and those included in the evaluation are identical with respect to 
observable characteristics  (Table A2 in Appendix A ), and therefore do not pose any 
threat to the internal validity of our impact analysis.  The content of messages sent to the 
farmers is reported in Appendix B .  
6.2 Challenges and internal validity  
According to AMEDD, the programme faced two main challenges: a government ban on 
cross- border cereal trade (i.e. cereal release limitation ) and the unwillingness of some 
farmers to comply with contract agreements . The AMEDD progr amme had promised to 
increase farmers’ cereal output as well as improve the quality  of their grains , so that they 
would then be able to sell to large buyers, whether within or outside Mali, with the latter 
presenting better prospects in terms of price. Unfortunately, for the programme, the 
Government of Mali refused  to let cereal trader s sell grains in other countries. The 
second issue relat ing to contract non -adherence came about because prices were higher 
in the open market at the time when farmers were  expected to sell cereals to 
aggregators, leading some farmers to side -sell.  
As the roll-out of the add- on mobile phone reminders  was largely under our control , the 
impact of which we seek to evaluate , we note very little, if any, th reats to the internal 
validity of the study. As Table A2 in Appendix A shows, there is no reason to believe that 
the few households that did not receive the message are symmetrically  different from 
those that did.  
The only threat to the internal validity of the study relates to the training received. 
Suppose that the quality and/or quantity of training received differed between the control 
and treatment groups , then we could not claim to be measuring  the effect of the add-on 
mobile phone reminders . However, because the randomi sation took place after the 
training , this does not pose a valid threat.  If the training  was not effective, it should affect 
both groups similarly.  
7. Impact on key outcomes 
7.1 Estima tion approach  
The successful implementation of the randomi sation allows us to use a simple strategy 
for evaluating the impact of mobile phone reminders on pre- and post-harvest  activity 
and aggregation services on key outcomes for smallholder farmer s, y k. For each 
outcome , we estimate three regressions:  
, 1, 2, , ()it k k k k i k i i it k y Time Treat Time Treat u e ab b d= + + + ´ ++         
 Eqn 1

31
, 1, 2, , ,
1()it k k k k i k i j it k k i it k

== + + + ´ + + ++ å
 Eqn 3 17 where i, t, and k represent household, time, and outcome of interest, respectively . Time 
is the time dummy , which equals 1 for endline and 0 for baseline.  Treat  is the treatment 
variable,  which equals 1 if the household is in the treatment group and 0 if the household 
is in the control group.  The impact indicator is the interaction between T ime and Treat , 
with the average treatment effect (ATE) being  .dRegion,  two of three cercle dummies, 
and x is a set of other controls  (household characteristics , namely : age, household 
composition and literacy rate), scale of producti on, type of aggregator,  and remoteness 
(measure d by distance to the regional capital) ; u is the unobserved household- specific 
effect,  and e is the random error term.   Eqn 1 is the base model (without any covariates); 
Eqn 2 adds on subregion (i.e. cercle) dummies; and Eqn 3 is the  full model where we 
control for the full set of covariates . 
Our outcome variables, y k, are one of three kinds: binary (0/1), fractions (0 ≤ y ≤ 1), 
corner solution outcomes with a mass at zero, and roughly continuous outcom es. Where 
the outcome is binary or roughly continuous , we use the linear random effects estimator, 
which yields a panel data linear probability model in cases where the outcome is binary. 
The drawbacks of the linear probability model specification are beni gn in this case 
because our interest is in the estimate of ATE ( Wooldridge 2002 p.445) . The added 
advantage of the linear probability model in this case, apart  from the ease in obtaining 
the ATE,  is that it allows us  to model unobserved heterogeneity using the correlated 
random effects approach (Wooldridge 2010 ). For the fractional and corner solution 
outcomes , we apply the fractional probit and random effect T obit estimators. For the 
nonlinear models,  we use the ‘contrast ’ capability of the Stata statistical software 
package to obtain the correct ATE  because in nonlinear models with interactions the 
coefficient on the interaction term may  not represent the correct marginal effect in a 
similar way as the case is in a linear regression model ( Ai and Norton 2003 ; Norton et al. 
2004) . 
7.2 Descriptive and b alance test 
7.2.1  Sample characteristics  
Given the identical number of households sampl ed per village across the three 
subregions at baseline , and the fact that nearly all households were successfully re-
interviewed at endline,  the proportion of households in the subregions in the sample is 
identical to those shown in Table 2. Yorosso represented the largest proportion (499 
households or nearly 40 % of the sample), followed by Koutiala (414 households 
representing 3 1% of the sample), and then Sikasso (373 households or 29% of the 
sample). The ex -ante and ex -post treatment groups were ident ical: 48  per cent  for the 
treatment  group (T1) and 52 per cent  for control (T0) at both baseline and endline.  
7.2.2  Balance test  
The diff erence- in-difference (DID) estimation technique is employed for evaluating the 
impact of the mobile phone reminders intervention (see section 7.1 for details). This 
approach is based on a number of assumptions, which must be valid in order to obtain an appropriate counterfactual for estimating causal effect.  With the successful  random 
assignment of villages to control (T0) and treatment (T1) groups, and in the absence of 
any observable contamination issues , we would expect farmers in the control and 
treatment villages to be similar on observable characteristics prior to the intervention. We verify this assumption by undert aking statistical tests for differences between the 18 treatment and control group at bas eline  on all key indicators . This is done by simply 
regressing each indicator , yk, on the treatment dummy ( Treat ). The general form of the 
regression for this test can be written as:  
,ik i y Treat u ar=+ +                       
Eqn 4 
Where Treat = 1 if household i is assigned to the treatment group ( T1) and 0 if in the 
control group (T0). The balance test is the test of the null hypothesis that 0r=. An 
indicator is balanced at baseline if we fail to reject the null hypothesi s at the 5 per cent  
level. The balance test results are in  Table 3. As one could expect from a successful 
randomi sation exercise, all our indicators are balanced because in each case we find 
insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that 0r= at the 5 per cent  level. We 
present a more detail ed discussion on each of the indicators in section 7.3 .

Table 3 also contains some information on important characteristics of the sample. 
Although l ess than 1 per cent  of household heads in the sample are f emale,  
approximately 30 per cent  of the farmers involved in the AMEDD program me are female. 
This proportion is balanced between the treatment and control groups.  The mean age of 
household heads is  54 years and the average household contains more than 18 
members. Other surveys in Mali also report large household sizes ( Beaman and Dillon 
2012; Guirkinger  et al. 2015) . The literacy rate among household heads in the sample is 
very low – only about 10  per cent  of head s are literate in French.  The mean cultivated 
area in the overall sample is greater than 14 hectares  and approximatel y 61 per cent  of 
this area is devoted to the grains of interest to the intervention.  19 There is yet another assumption that must be satisfied for impact estimates using DID to 
be valid, which  is the parallel trend assumption. Essentially, f or our counterfactual to be 
valid so as not to compromise the  internal validity of our DID estimates , we must be 
convinced that  in the absence of the mobile phone training reminders, the difference in 
observed outcomes between the treatment  and control groups is constant over time. In 
other words , we need to ask the question: would the treated farmers have experienced 
the same outcomes as the control group farmers if they did not receive the mobile phone 
reminders ? Does the mean change in grain losses and food sec urity, for example , 
among the control group represent a valid counterfactual change in the treatment group 
if we had not distributed mobile phones and sent training reminders?  Typically, t his 
assumption is evaluated graphically using  more than one pre -intervention observation on 
the outcome variable(s) of interest.  With only one pre- intervention data point, however, 
we are unable to provide such evidence based on our data.  
However, given the manner of our randomi sation,  we do not have any reason t o believe 
that, without the mobile phones and reminders , the mean outcomes of interest for the 
treatment and control groups would have followed dissimilar paths over time. One of the 
ways the parallel trend assumption  could be violated is if pre -treatment characteri stics 
that are correlated with changes in our outcomes of interest are unbalanced between the 
treatment and control groups ( Abadie 2005 ). Theref ore, apart  from the outcomes of 
primary interest, we have verified that variables associated with the outcomes are also 
balanced between treatment and control groups.  Take the occurrence of weather -related 
shocks, for example. We expect ed such shocks to be  correlated with crop losses, food 
crop incomes and food security. We find, however, that such covariate shocks are 
balanced between the control and treatment groups. Nonetheless, the unavailability of 
pre-baseline data limits a more thorough data- driven evaluation of the parallel trend 
assumption, and this must be recogni sed when interpreting our  impact results.  
7.3 Impact results 
The AMEDD theory of change posits that providing training to farmers on pre- and post -
harvest grain handling and quality management will reduce crop losses as well as 
improve grain quality, allowing farmers to access better markets. The content of the 
actual training covered pre-  and post -harvest activities . We therefore expect ed reminders 
about such activities to have an impact at three levels . The first is an impact on 
behavio ur, which may be observed through indicators such as harvesting time, 
harvesting cost, demand for post -harvest related services , increased likelihood of grain 
storage, and the adoption of improved storage meth ods. The second level of impact is 
on crop output and marketing, and is captured using indicators such as pre - and post -
harvest grain losses, output commerciali sation,  selling through aggregation centr es, and 
mean price received  for grains . The impact on price is expected to arise due to the 
expected improvement in grain quality. The third level of impact indic ators c oncerns the 
overarching program me goals : smallholder farmer s’ income s and food security.  From the 
program me’s perspective , the main research question is: what impact does reminding 
smallholder farmers about training on pre- and post -harvest handling and quality 
management have on the levels of grain losses, food crop incomes and food security?  
 20 7.3.1  Impact of reminders on change i n behaviour  
The first level of the program me’s theory of change relates to changes in behaviou r 
following the receipt of the mobile phone reminders. The study is especially interested in 
behavio ur changes related to timely harvesting and associated investm ents, and storage 
practices and facilities , all of which aim  at reducing los ses (both in the field and after 
harvesting), and improving the quality of the grains taken to market .  
Impact of reminders on harvesting time and cost  
The first variable through which behavio ural change could be detected is harvesting time 
and investment in timely harvesting in order to minimi se los ses in the field and preserve 
the quality  of grains. Farmers in the treatment group received reminders about when to 
harvest their grains. We expect ed such  messages to have an impact on harvest ing 
practices. We expect ed to see this change through differences in harvesting time 
between the treatment and control groups. We also expect ed harvesting costs to differ if 
timely and appropriate harvesting practices attract either an increase or a reduction in 
cost. 
The DID regression results ( Table 4) show t hat treated farmers harvested their grains 
about two weeks earlier, on average, than the control group farmers . Figure A1 in 
Appendix A provides graphi cal evidence, which shows that although there was no 
significant difference in mean time of harvesting at baseline (the error bars on the graph 
in the left panel overlap2), the right panel shows that the reminders made an impact.

Although we need more information to be able to determine the ideal harvesting time 
from our data, the finding that mean harvesting time differs between the treat ment  and 
control groups after the reminders is revealing by itself. We find, however, that the impact on difference in harvesting time did not translate to a significant difference in 
                                                
2 Error bars , referring to the confidence intervals,  are graphical representations of the variability of 
data and used on graphs to indicate the error or uncertainty in a reported measurement.  If the error 
bars overlap, then we are certain that there is no impact at the given significant level.  21 harvesting cost ( Table 4 and Figure A2  in Appendix A ). In general, this suggests that 
cost is not as much of a constraint to timely harvesting as reinforcing farmer knowledge 
about when to harvest. This would be a plausible argument , particularly if we find that the 
difference in the timing of harvesting translates to a significant impact on pre- harvest loss 
reduction for the treat ment  group compared with the control group.  
Impact of reminders on the adoption of improved storage methods  
How grains are handled post -harvest  is an important determinant of  the overall quality 
and value subsequently ( Compton  et al. 1998 ; Iguaz  et al. 2006 ). Crop storage is crucial 
in the agriculture value chain and farmers ’ capacity  to store crops may result in higher 
crop value, especially in areas that experience wide seas onal price volatility, as is 
common in SSA. Having received training on pre-  and post -harvest grain handling and 
storage, we expect ed the mobile phone reminders prompt ing farmers to apply the 
knowledge acquired to encourage the use of improved storage meth ods. From the 
program me’s perspective, this is important for the key outcome indicator s of grain los ses 
and grain quality.  
Our data show that nearly all households who store grains do so using local silos. 
Further, less than 1 per cent  of all households reported storing grains at aggregation 
centr es. Therefore, to measure the impact of the reminders on the adoption of improved 
storage methods , we construct ed an indicator that takes the value 1 for those who store 
in recommended bags wit h chemical treatment and zero otherwise. Our hypothesis was 
that the reminders (particularly reminder 8) would have significant positive impact on 
improved storage behaviou r. The regression results ( Table 5) provide the test of the 
above hypothesis. The null hypothesis that the reminders  had no impact on change in 
adoption of improved storage methods is rejected at the 5 per cent  level.  The estimated 
difference in the probability of adoption is approximately 11  percentage points  higher for 
the treat ment  group than it is for the control group.  Graphical evidence of impact can be 
found in Figure A3 in Appendix A , which shows that the adoption of improved grain 
storage methods was identical at baseline for the control and treat ment  groups (left 
panel), but the reminders had a positive impact, as the right  panel of the graph shows.

Source : ISSER/GRE ThA field data 2015 and 2016 22 Impact of reminders on choice of marketplace  
Next, we examine the impact of the reminders on choice of marketplace. One of the core 
behavio ural chang es targeted by the AMEDD program me is for farmers to sell grains in 
bulk through aggregation centres. The rational e is as follows. Smallholder farmers tend 
to sell limited quantities of low- quality grains directly from the farm gate, often to small -
scale traders whose prices may be lower than those available in other markets, partly 
due to transportation costs. In addi tion, due to post -harvest storage challenges, farmers 
in remote locations may also sell their crops at very low prices in small -scale local 
marketplaces, especially at times when prices are low because of excess supply. 
Therefore, we expect ed the reminders  on crop aggregation (Message 4 in Appendix B) 
to prompt smallholders to sell to cooperatives and private aggregators . This is based on 
the premise that these buyers indeed offer better prices. We note that the choice of 
marketplace is conditioned by a num ber of other factors: output volumes, distance to 
markets, wealth status of the farmer, FBO membership and market information, among other things  (Fafchamps and Hill 2005; Muamba 2011; Zanello  et al. 2014 ). However, 
the AMEDD program me tried to address some of these.   
In the pooled sample, only about 13% of farmers reported selling grains through 
aggregation centr es (12.5% at baselin e and 12.7% at endline). Therefore , we use d a 
binary response variable to test the hypothesis that the reminders increase the 
probability  of sale through aggregation centr es for the treatment group over and above 
that for the control group.  
The DID regression results ( Table 6) show  that the reminders  had no significant impact  
on grain sales through aggregation centr es. Information from our process  monitoring and 
focus group discussions suggest that the aggregation centr e mean price was generally 
lower than prices in  the open market. Indeed, from our data we find that households who 
sold grains through aggregation centr es received U S$17  less per tonne  of grain sold 
compared with those who sold elsewhere ( US$190 versus US$207 per ton ne). Figure A4 
in Appendix A  provides graphical evidence, which supports the results in Table 6 : the 
share of farmers selling grains through aggregation centr es was balanced at ba seline 
(left panel) , and there is no visible sign of impact after the mobile phone reminders 
intervention (right panel) .

Here, we examine the impact of the mobile phone reminders intervention on some of the 
core outcomes  of the AMEDD program me: crop losses and commerciali sation.  
Impact of reminders on pre - and post -harvest grain los ses 
One of the main goals of the AGRA -funded A MED D program me is to improve grain 
quality . This objective can be achieved through the adoption of appropriate pre-  and 
post-harvest grain management practices. Here, we  assess the impact of the mobile 
phone reminders  intervention on pre-  and post -harvest grain  losses. We use binary 
indicators for measuring these impacts because of the very low incidence of post -harvest  
grain losses ( 7.2% and 10.7% at baseline and endline,  respectively) .  
First, we observe a general rise in both pre-  and post -harvest losses between baseline 
and endline. Pre- harvest loss incidence increased from 17.7  per cent  at baseline to 40.9 
per cent at endline. This rise has been attributed to weather -related  factors , particularly 
rainfall, according to farmers . This is not surprising because the literature ( De Bruijn  et 
al. 2005 ; Generoso 2015)  suggests that climate variability , especially  the alternation of 
good and bad weather from one year to the next is common in Ma li and has  detrimental 
consequences for crop production outcomes , in particular because of the largely rainfed 
nature of production systems . Therefore , while not all losses are under the control of the 
farmer, we expect ed the reminders intervention to reduce the rate of crop loss for the 
treatment  group compared with the control group.  
Table 7 provides the DID regression results, show ing that the mobile phone reminders 
reduc ed the incidence of pre- harvest losses. The reminders are estimated to have 
reduced  pre-harvest losses by approximately 14 percentage points. This is a large 
impact magnitude , compared with the control group mean loss of about 33  per cent . 
Further evidence is provided in Figure A5 in Appendix A , which shows that whereas an 
identical share of farmers in the treatm ent and control groups reported pre- harvest grain 
losses at baseline (left panel), significantly fewer farmers in the treatment group reported 
any pre- harvest losses at endline (right panel).

Source : ISSER/GRE ThA field data 2015 and 2016 24 Moving to post -harvest losses, the regression results ( Table 7) show that the impact of 
the reminders on post -harvest losses is rather imprecisely estimated, showing no 
significant impact. Figure A6  in Appendix A provides graphical evidence, which is 
consistent with the regression results. Although this might seem surprising at first glance, 
this could be expl ained by the timing of the endline survey. It may take longer than 4– 5 
months to observe any impact on storage losses, which are an important component of 
total post -harvest losses. Also, it might be difficult to drive down significantly the already 
low le vels of post -harvest losses reported by farmers, bar ring measurement error in such 
farmer- reported post -harvest losses.  
Impact of reminders on output commerciali sation  
Next, we examine reminders’ impac t on produce commerciali sation. Our hypothesis was 
that farmers who adhere to the reminders about harvesting, threshing and storage would 
have higher marketable grain surplus. Reminder 4 (Append ix B), in particular , deals with 
marketing and we expect ed that this (together with the other messages) would increase 
grain market participation and volumes sold. Note that cotton is the dominant cash crop 
in the study area and grain market participation  is not high –  at baseline, only about half 
of grain producers reported any sales . We estimate d the impact of the reminders on the 
volume of grains sold using the Tobit  estimator.  
The Tobit regression results ( Table 8) show that , although the treat ment  group mean 
grain sale volume is approximately 94 kilograms  higher than that of  the control group 
mean , this is imprecisely estimated , meaning that the remin ders did not have a 
significant impact on the volume of grains sold.  Figure A7  in Appendix A provides 
graphical evidence, which is consistent with the regression results.  The left panel shows 
that there is no significant difference in the volume of grains marketed at baseline. The 
right panel shows that this outcome did not change after treatment. Again, these results 
could be different if the endline data were  collected later than 4 –5 months after the 
harvest , when more sales volumes may have been reported. However,  we note from the 
focus group discussions and key informant interviews that many farmers consider the 
grains they produce to be more important for consumption than for income generation 
through sales. Cotton is seen as the main cash crop,  with the grains being important for 
food security.

Source : ISSER/GRE ThA field data 2015 and 2016 25 7.3.3  Impact of reminders on higher -level outcomes  – incomes and food security  
The end goal of the AMEDD program me is to increase smallholder farmer s’ incomes and 
reduce food insecurity. We therefore examine whether the reminders had any impact on 
these high- level indicators.  
Impact of reminders on food crop income  
The aim of the AMEDD program me was to raise farmer s’ incomes by increasing the 
volume and quality of grains produced and sold through aggregation centr es. Given that 
we did not find any impact on sales volumes, no impact on incomes may accrue unless 
there are price differentials arising from differences in the quality of grains and the type 
of market through which the two groups sell their grains . The village mean grain price 
difference between the control and treatment villages is only US$3.97 ( standard error  = 
US$2.39) , which is not statistically different from zero.  In general, therefore, on e would 
not expect the reminders intervention to have a significant impact on food crop incomes, 
contrary to the aim of the program me. 
The estimated mean food crop income at baseline was US$552 (US$ 539 for the control 
group and US$569 for the treatment group).  At endline, mean food crop income fell (by 
approximately 8% overall) –  not surprising given the reduction in grain sales. The Tobit 
regression results ( Table 9) show  that, although the reminders increased mean food crop 
incomes  by approximately US$77 , this difference is imprecise and thus not statistically 
different from zero. Figure A8 in Appendix A shows graphical evidence. T he left panel 
shows  that food crop income was identical at baseline  between the two groups, and the 
story did not change significantly at endline (right panel). This is not surprising given the 
reasons presented earlier. Given the time lag between treatment and endline,  it is 
possible that even with reduced crop losses and increased smallholder market , the 
impact on incomes would not be immediately detected .

Impact of reminders on food (in)security  
Finally , we examine the impact of the mobile phone reminders on food security . The 
ration ale for expecting the reminders intervention to have an impact on food security  is 
as follows. All other things being equal , timely harvesting , which the treatment aimed to 26 encourage , as well as proper storage,  should  make more food available to the household 
for longer periods of the year , particular ly under the sem i-arid conditions faced by the 
population in our study area , including the unimodal rainfall pattern.  The impact  of the 
reminders on pre- harvest crop losses and the adoption of improved storage methods 
should make more grains, the main staple foods in the study area, available to the 
households over a longer period and thereby  reduce the incidence of hunger .   
The i mpact on food security is evaluated using the incidence of food shortage. The 
baseline and endline surveys asked households about the following food insecurity 
experiences:  
• In the last 12 months, did you or other adults (18 years and above) in your 
household lose weight because there was not enough money for food?  
• In the last 12 months, did you or other adults (18 years and above) in your 
household ever have to miss meals  for a whole day because there was not 
enough money for food?  
• In the last 12 months, did you ever have to reduce the quantity or quality of your 
child’s meals because there was not enough money for food?  
• In the last 12 months, did a child ever have to skip meals because there was not 
enough money for food?  
• In the last 12 months, was a  child ever hungry but you just could not afford more 
food?  
• In the last 12 months, did a child ever have to forego meals  for a whole day 
because there was not enough money for food?  
A household is categori sed as having suffered food shortage or hunger if they responded 
‘yes’ to any of the above questions. Overall, only 13% of households responded ‘yes’ to 
at least one of the above (14% at baseline and 11% at endline).

The regression results (Table 10) show that the reminders had a statistically significant 
impact  on food shortage incide nce. The incidence of food shortage reduced among the 
treated households by approximately 7  percentage points compared with the control 
group; this is a large impact magnitude relative to the control group’s  mean food 27 shortage incidence.  Figure A9 in Appendix A provides further support to the regression 
results. The incidence of food shortage is identical between the treatment and control 
groups at basel ine. However, treated households have a significantly lower incidence of 
food shortage after the intervention. It seems that the reduction in crop losses and the 
adoption of improved storage  methods makes more food available to the household for 
consumption and not necessarily for sale,  and likely reduces the so -called ‘sell low, buy 
high’ behavio ur of smallholder farmers (Stephens and Barrett 2011; Dzanku 2015; 
Dzanku 2017) . 
7.3.4  Impact heterogeneity  
We examine the differential impact of the reminders by type of aggregator and sex of 
farmer. We focus on three key outcome indicators: crop losses, adoption of improved storage methods and food security.  We do this by estimating the impact of treatment on 
the selected outcom es at endline by estimating the following equation:  
31
, ,,
1() ,ik k k i j ik k ik
jy Group Treat Region x e ap g h-
==+ ´ + + + å          
Eqn 5 
where Group  denotes aggregator type (equals 1 if private aggregator and 0 if 
cooperative) or sex of farmer (equals 1 if female farmer and 0 if male farmer), x is a 
vector of control variables including the baseline outcome and household demographics.  
If the reminders intervention has a differential impact , then π k should be significantly 
different from zero at the 5 per cent  level.   
Table 11  tests the presence of differential impact of treatment by aggregator type for 
improved grain storage method adoption, pre- harvest grain losses and hunger incidence. 
The results show no evidence that the reminders  intervention had differential impact by 
aggregator type for any of the three outcomes at the 5 per cent  level.  Similarly, Table 12 
shows no differential impact of treatment by gender of farmer for all three outcomes at 
the 5  per cent  level.

7.4 Summary of i mpact results  
We have analy sed the impact of mobile phone training reminders about pre- and post -
harvest grain handling and management on a number of indicators summari sed in Table 
13. Out of the eight  indicators assessed, t he results show  the impact of the reminders  on 
three  of them : adoption of improved methods of grain storage, pre -harvest losses and 
the incidence of food shortage. We conjecture that i t could take longer than the 4 –5 
months left between intervention and endline survey, to observe an impact on other 
outcomes even if the intervention drives those outcomes (e.g. post -harvest losses and 
income). Nonetheless, the observed impact on food security is an important one.

  29 8. Discussion  
8.1 Threats to internal validity  
8.1.1  Contamination and attrition  
As we noted in section 6, we are not aware of any serious contamination issue that could 
render the results of the analysis invalid. There is  therefore no obvious threat to internal 
validity. Attrition is not a problem given that only two households could not be followed at 
endline.  
8.1.2  Hawthorne and John Henry e ffects  
In our experiment, one could argue that the Hawthorne and John Henry effects are more 
likely to be an issue among the treatment than control group because the geographical 
dispersion of the two groups makes it unlikely for the control group to know that their 
counterparts in other communities are being treated. The treatment and control villages 
(and households) do not belong to the same famer groups  or cooperatives. However, the 
treatment  group could interpret the reminders as a test of the knowledge received during 
training and may therefore feel under some pressure to perform. This could be a 
limitation to our study.  
8.2 Threats to external validity  
8.2.1  Heterogeneity  
Our results show that, for a number of the indicators, the Yorosso c ercle seems to be 
different from the other two, and this could be driving some of the results. Yorosso is the 
most remote of the three subregions and is generally poorer. Further analysis may 
therefore be required to gauge such possible heterogeneous impacts.  
8.3 Stakeholder expectations and e xperiences  
The presentation of our baseline and impact results generated great interest from 
government, farmer organi sations and non-governm ental organisations  in Mali.  
Participants, including government officials from the Ministry of Agriculture,  raised some 
concerns and provided some recommendations. Some raised questions about the focus 
on grains in the Sikasso region, claiming tha t cotton rather than grains is the most 
important crop in the region. The program me implementers (AMEDD) defended the 
choice of Sikasso , stating that the villages chosen in the region are major grain 
producers and that diversification is important even in a cotton- dominant area.  The 
government officials , in particular , recommended that the program me be scaled up to 
other regions in southern Mali, especially  Ségou and Bandiagara.  
Participants also raised concerns about accuracy in the measurement of post -harvest 
losses from farmer recalls. They recommend that the figures produced by the survey be 
taken as very rough estimates and that a lot more work is required to capture accurately 
the exact extent of post -harvest losses.  
Some participants were of the opinion that , given the intervention timelines, it is 
premature to talk about impact. They suggest ed the need for a third round of data 
collection in order to measure the impact more accurately.  30 8.4 Key lessons from this study  
The ISSER team has been involved in a number of impact evaluations with varying 
experiences and frustrations coming mainly from non- adherence to experimental 
assignments by implementation agencies. This particular evaluation was similarly 
threatened. The threats, however, led us to be innovative. At the end, we believe the 
experiment we have conducted was  largely successful because issues of non-
compliance were reduced . For the so- called ‘real time’ or ‘real world’ experiments to be 
successful, it is our view that much stronger commitment has  to be engendered between 
program me-implementing agencies and researcher s; this collaboration has to be ‘forced’ 
rather than left to the discretion of the parties involved.  
9. Specific findings for policy and practices  
The overall goal of the program me, a co mponent of which we have evaluated,  was to 
increase farmer s’ incomes by linking them to markets and increasing their market power. 
Our overarching hypothesis was that a one- time face- to-face training was not enough to 
ensure that farmers applied what they learned –  training must be reinforced through 
reminders. Thanks to ICT penetration across Africa, we were successful in sending 
farmers mobile phone reminder s that enabled us to test our reinforcement hypothesis.  
Our hypotheses test s were at three levels: (1) impact on behavio ur changes as seen 
through the adoption of practices and techniques that could reduce pre-  and post -harvest 
losses and improve grain quality; (2) direct impact on outcomes such as grain  losses and 
grain marketing; and (3) impact on higher -level outcomes  such as income and food 
security. At each level, we found  some evidence of impact,  often of reasonably high 
magnitude that is not only statistically significant but also practically important . The 
quality of evide nce can be indicated as : (1) a high positive change in behavio ur related  to 
the adoption of improved grain storage methods; (2) impact on pre-harvest grain losses ; 
and (3) finally , a strong impact on food security.  
An important question, which also came up during the dissemination of the impact 
results at stakeholder engagement sessions in Mali , relates to the scalability of the 
intervention, particularly the mobile phone reminders arm.  There were questions about 
the cost -effectiveness of this arm  of the intervention. However, our calculations show 
that the reminders are relatively inexpensive compared with methods such as farmer 
field school s, for example. It cost approximately US$31 to reach a farmer with the 
reminders. This includes US$20 per mobile phone and SIM card, and US$11 for setting 
up the platform and sending the messages.  The US$31 figure translates to 
approximately 159 kilograms of grain in the study area. While we are unable to calculate the exact quantity of grains that the reminders saved,  the impact on reducing hunger is 
large and could well be above US$31 in monetary terms.  As an alternative, farmer field 
schools and similar agricultural extension program mes are estimated to cost  between 
US$42 and US$62 per famer (Quizon  et al.  2001) . The reminder arm of the intervention 
could , in fact, be undertaken at a much lower cost, because it could be implemented with 
a high degree of success without giving each farmer a mobile phone. In our sample, for 
example, 98  per cent  of farmers had their own phones, which could be used for sending 
them reminders.  31 The overall takeaway from a policy perspective is that one needs to think more carefully 
about the approaches to boosting agricultural technology adoption in rural Africa beyond 
the tra ditionally know n approaches. The high penetration of mobile phones in the region 
could be seen as a vehicle for proving ‘real -time’ agricultur al technology advice to 
farmers. The cost of doing this is relatively inexpensive (compared with face- to-face 
training, for example).32 Appendixes

  Mali is a landlocked, low-income and  
food-deficit country in the African Sahel. 
Farmers face adverse weather conditions 
and poor access to agricultural inputs, 
knowledge of improved grain management 
practices, credit facilities and output 
markets. Osei and colleagues assessed the 
impact of mobile phone voice reminders for 
a pre- and post-harvest grain management 
training on farmer behaviour and household 
income. The reminders had a significant 
impact on the timing of the grain harvest 
and the adoption of improved grain storage 
methods. While the incidence of  
pre-harvest grain losses lowered 
significantly, there was no impact on
