INTRODUCTION
The purpose of  this guide is to help health authorities and health information officers align health information 
system (HIS) data sources with standards and best practices. This alignment will maximize the likelihood that 
information on health conditions, services, and resources are recorded in a consistent way and ensure that reliable 
data produce comparable statistics at all levels of  the health system. 
Technical standards for health-related data provide common nomenclatures (common terminologies and 
definitions) and taxonomies (classifications and coding mechanisms) for deriving comparable health indicators. 
Standards are typically global because they are developed and maintained through an extended process of  expert 
input and consultations with specialists from around the world. International organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and other agencies of  the United Nations (UN), because of  their constituent member states, are well-positioned to coordinate the development of  standards and achieve wide technical and 
political consensus on those standards. 
National standards are important especially for types of  data for which global standards do not exist. The same 
principles apply to national and international standards; both should facilitate the generation of  data that record 
all possible conditions, resources, or activity (exhaustive) and ensure that each condition, resource, or activity can 
be classified according to a unique definition (mutually exclusive), in a format that can be analyzed statistically. Data that are aligned with standards that incorporate these principles will help ensure reliable comparisons of  indicators across geographical areas and subpopulations, and over time, for any unit of  analysis. 
Best practices reflect successful approaches taken to implement standards or to provide needed guidance if  
standards are not available. They often address areas of  HIS modernization, such as evolving technological 
solutions, and are developed by groups with expertise in a particular niche (Heywood & Boone, 2015; Ministry of  Medical Services and Ministry of  Public Health and Sanitation, n.d.). Academic institutions, expert communities, and nongovernmental organizations frequently have the flexibility and specialized professionals to explore a range 
of  solutions and promote best practices. The DHIS 2 community, for example—supported by the University 
of  Oslo, the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD), the Research Council of  Norway, the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief  (PEPFAR), and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, 
Tuberculosis and Malaria—provides examples of  best practices in using a web-based open-source software to 
compile and manage routine health data (DHIS 2, n.d.). 
Although standards and best practices are continuously evolving, countries’ ongoing efforts to align data 
sources will increase the HIS efficiency to monitor population health status and health ser vice delivery, identify 
health inequalities, and allocate health finances to achieve universal health care. Aligning data sources will also improve the quality of  national-level indicators used for benchmarking a country relative to others and facilitate participation in global development goals. Perhaps most importantly, HIS stakeholders will have increased 
confidence in the statistics that the system generates—especially, in terms of  the statistics’ relevance (meeting the 
needs of  users), reliability (consistency in their capacity to measure), and validity (proximity to the true value of  what the statistics aim to measure). 
This guide is primarily directed to national health authorities and health information officers in ministries of  health. It 
may also be informative for a wider range of  technical and policy-oriented professionals. Each HIS data source module covers an HIS data source, summarizes best practices and standards for data from that source, and offers additional references to tools and resources. The twelve modules, along with a brief  explanation of  each source, follow: 
Module 1: Individual Records. These are a source of  patient level data on diagnoses and service 
interventions.

The reference guide builds on the Health Metrics Network (HMN) Framework (WHO & Health Metrics Network 
[HMN], 2008) and the Health Information System Strengthening Model (MEASURE Evaluation, 2016). In 
particular, it delves into the data source component that is common to both of  these conceptual models. Within that 
component it identifies 12 main data sources that generate the data needed to compute a range of  health indicators. Table 1 groups these data sources as facility-based, institution-based, and other, and summarizes each according to the type of  data generated, the primary unit of  analysis, possible disaggregation, and related standards.

 Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best Practices for Data Sources   11Institution-Based Data Sources
Institution-based data sources comprise routine, administrative data sources as well as cross-sectional data that 
are collected through periodic health facility assessments (Table 1). The common characteristic that groups these 
data sources together as “institution-based” is that the primary data describe an activity, situation, or resource 
associated with a given health institution. 
The routine, administrative data sources include individual records and health resource information systems to 
monitor infrastructure, health workforce, commodities, and finances. These data sources are part of  the routine health information system (RHIS). In an RHIS, health facilities record continuous primary data, many of  which are later 
compiled, verified, and transmitted to regional and national levels, often in aggregate format ( Lippeveld, et al., 2000). 
Population-Based Data Sources
Population-based data sources are population censuses, civil registration vital statistics (CRVS) systems, and 
population surveys (Table 1). The CRVS system records routine, administrative data on a continuous basis, 
and census and survey data collections are undertaken periodically. The common characteristic among these 
data sources is that their data are representative of  the general population. If  data quality is good, then reliable inferences can be made to the general population in subnational areas, or to subpopulations such as sex and age groups or other sociodemographic groups. These data sources are typically managed outside the health sector, although they provide important health and demographic data for the HIS. 
Other, Mixed Data Sources
This is a catch-all category for data sources that are not—or not entirely—institution-based or population-based. The public health surveillance system is rooted largely in the RHIS (institution-based data source), but it also relies 
on ad hoc reports from sources outside the health sector to identify and respond to public health emergencies. 
The health accounts data source collects data from financial sources, primarily at the central level, but it also relies on survey data for household consumption information. Collective intervention records are derived from health promotion activities initiated within or outside of  the health sector. 
Core Health Indicators
Countries define their own sets of  core health indicators that provide information about the performance of  the health system. These indicators are typically monitored in the context of  a national health strategy document and 
other plans and policies that define the country’s vision, priorities, and courses of  action ( WHO, 2016 ). 
Although health system priorities and the burden of  disease vary across countries, the types of  information needed 
to monitor them is similar. Therefore, national sets of  core health indicators include common indicator domains and even some common indicators. For example, in countries with a high burden of  HIV , tuberculosis, and malaria, 
the international community has developed disease-specific indicator sets (WHO, 2015; United Nations Office 
for Project Services, 2015; Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), 2008; President’s Malaria Initiative, 2009; WHO, 2013). Under the auspices of  the UN, countries have defined a set of  health-related indicators in the context of  the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to monitor public health priorities globally ( UN, 2016). 
WHO has published a model set of  100 core indicators to monitor health system performance ( WHO, 2015).
Whatever the composition of  the core indicator set, data from multiple data sources will be required to compute them. It is useful to map the indicator data elements to each of  the data sources needed to generate them. This mapping exercise will reveal the relative demand across the HIS data sources. It is also useful to map each of  the core 
health indicators to an indicator domain in order to evaluate the balance of  indicators that the country has selected. 
Data source demand. Core health indicators provide insights into the demand on each data source to generate 
data. As an illustration of  how countries may evaluate demand, we mapped the WHO Global Reference List (GRL) of  100 Core Health Indicators ( WHO, 2015) and health-related indicators from the SDGs, to the 12 main data sources.  12  Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best Practices for Data Sources
Figure 1 shows the percentage of  data elements, among all data elements for these indicators, expected from each 
data source. Results reveal that about half  of  the WHO GRL indicators are derived from data from individual records 
and surveys, and about a third are derived from CRVS and censuses. SDG indicators are derived mainly from CRVS, 
censuses, and surveys. Note that for both indicator sets, the share of  data from censuses tends to correspond to the share of  data from CRVS. This is because the CRVS provides numerator information for causes of  death and the census provides denominator information on exposure, and together they provide an indicator of  prevalence.

Balance of indicators. Countries can ascertain the balance of  their core indicators by grouping them in 
different domains.1 To determine the balance of  the WHO GRL and SDG indicators we used the four WHO indicator 
domains—health status, risk factors, service coverage, and health system ( WHO, 2015).2 Figure 2 shows the percentage 
of  indicators in each of  the domains. The WHO GRL indicators comprise a fairly balanced mix from each category of  
the health system (21 to 28 indicators in each domain); the SDG indicators are focused on two categories: population 
health status and risk factors. These results are not surprising, because the WHO GRL indicators are used to monitor performance of  national health systems and the SDG indicators are used to assess global health status.

Description
Individual records contain sociodemographic and medically relevant information on healthcare clients. Clinicians 
use the information in records to manage patients’ care and coordinate integrated services. Hospital administrators 
use summary indicators to monitor patient safety and quality of  care. Policymakers track the incidence and 
prevalence of  health conditions, and quantity of  service consumption, to efficiently finance the health system. 
The format of  health records varies widely between countries and even between health facilities within a country. 
In general, service providers in many countries use paper-based records in the form of  patient charts or registries, and many are also transitioning to electronic records. Electronic patient records have numerous advantages for 
accurately recording, efficiently storing and retrieving, and transfer ring information between healthcare providers.
1
As electronic records evolve, there must be a joint effort between IT, clinicians, and coders so that information in 
patient health records and disease registries is transformed into useful data. The electronic environment should 
allow for clinicians to document patient diagnoses as accurately as possible, and coders to transform the diagnoses 
into unique codes. This synergy is only possible if  all parties are working according to standards that provide terminology and definitions, a set of  rules and instructions for their use, and common classification and coding mechanisms. These conditions alone allow for patient diagnoses and clinical procedures to be transcribed into a statistically analyzable format. 
This module introduces standard classifications for generating comparable data on morbidity diagnoses and 
healthcare interventions. It focuses on information in individual records managed by hospitals or ambulatory 
providers, in the form of  patient records or registries. 
Types of Indicators
Morbidity diagnoses. The diagnosis or condition used for morbidity tabulation is the main one, defined as “the condition, diagnosed at the end of  the episode of  healthcare, primarily responsible for the patient’s need for 
treatment or investigation” (WHO, 2011). 
Table 2 shows selected patient morbidity indicators derived from individual records. Maternal, newborn, and 
communicable diseases are the leading causes of  disease burden in many low-income countries, so these countries place an emphasis on monitoring prevalence and incidence indicators related to these mainly infectious conditions (World Health Organization [WHO], 2008). 
Many countries also monitor, or are starting to monitor, chronic conditions as indicators of  the quality of  
healthcare (Department of  Health and Human Services, 2001; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD], 2015; WHO, 2016d). For example, monitoring the rates of  asthma, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and congestive heart failure cases admitted to the hospital, by the type of  patient,
2 
is an indicator of  the efficiency of  the health system because it measures hospital admissions that might be 
avoidable if  adequate primary care interventions were available. These conditions are referred to as avoidable 
hospital admissions. 
3 The OpenMRS, for example, is a free and open-source medical record system that can be adapted to customize patient records. It is 
used in countries worldwide and has an active community of experts that support its adaptation and implementation (OpenMRS, n.d.).
4 There are three types of patients: (1) inpatients admitted to the hospital and discharged alive, (2) outpatients accessing ambulatory care, and (3) day cases receiving the range of hospital services, without spending the night.

Health interventions. A health intervention is an action performed for, with, or on behalf  of  a person 
or population whose purpose is to assess, improve, maintain, promote, or modify health, functioning, or health 
conditions (International Classification of  Health Interventions [ICHI] Alpha, 2016). 
Table 3 shows selected health intervention indicators derived from individual records. As with morbidity 
indicators, low-income countries place an emphasis on monitoring the coverage of  health interventions for people with infectious diseases including HIV , tuberculosis, malaria, and selected tropical diseases (WHO, 2015). 
Many countries also monitor some or all of  the 30 common hospital interventions defined by the Hospital Data 
Project (OECD/Eurostat/WHO-Europe, 2013).
3 Although international comparisons of  these interventions are 
complicated by the use of  different classification systems across countries,4 countries with a national intervention 
classification can make valid subnational comparisons with their local codes (Hospital Data Project, 2003). 
5 These interventions include, among others, cataract surgery, tonsillectomy, Caesarean section, coronary angioplasty, coronary bypass, 
appendectomy, hysterectomy, kidney transplant, and knee and hip replacement. 
6 An international procedure list is not yet available, and several countries have adopted the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) developed by the United States. Other countries use a variety of national procedure 
coding classifications and map their local codes to the ICD-9-CM sentinel list (comprising 18 codes). The ICD-9-CM was the U.S.-devel-
oped standardized list of codes for diagnoses and procedures. In 2015, the United States transitioned to a new classification based on an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) adaptation (ICD-10-CM) for diagnoses and ICD-10 Procedure 
Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) for procedural codes. Module 1: Individual Records    17Table 3. Health intervention indicators derived from individual records

Standards are designed to provide comparable data 
not just on priority diseases and services, but also 
evidence of  emerging conditions and the use of  
new technologies. As populations move through an epidemiological transition—shifting from mainly maternal, newborn, and communicable diseases to 
chronic conditions—decision makers need data on the 
breadth of  conditions and treatments being sought. The WHO developed the Family of  International Health Classifications  for this purpose.
The WHO Family of  International Health 
Classifications (WHO-FIC) facilitates the coding 
of  primary data in individual records to enable a comprehensive and comparable analysis of  morbidity 
diagnoses and health service delivery. It does so 
by developing and maintaining three standard classifications that take into account the range of  possible health conditions, health interventions, and areas of  bodily functioning and disability. 
Two of  these classifications, the International 
Classification of  Diseases (ICD) and the ICHI, are most relevant to monitoring health system performance and 
population health status.

Standards for Morbidity Diagnoses
The ICD is the global standard for mortality and morbidity. It provides an international classification and corresponding coding system for all possible diagnoses. International Classification of  Diseases, Tenth Revision 
(ICD-10) is the current version that has been in effect since 1990.
6 The ICD-10 conditions are grouped in a way 
that is conducive to monitoring epidemiology trends in the population. To initiate coding using ICD, the clinician records an accurate medical diagnosis of  the patient’s conditions. Then, a records clerk or other designated person 
systematically codes the information according to the ICD list of  morbidity conditions. 
Healthcare clients may present multiple health problems. The condition used for morbidity tabulation is the 
main condition (WHO, 2011). If  there is more than one such condition, then the one considered responsible for 
the greatest use of  resources should be selected. If  no diagnosis was made, then the main symptom, abnormal 
finding, or problem should be selected as the main condition.
5 The other classification, International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF), was endorsed by the WHO member 
states in 2001. This classification is used in clinical settings to assess the functioning and disability of an individual on a small scale, 
and the process of implementing it in national legislation and health and social reporting systems is being piloted in rehabilitation, 
home care, and disability evaluation activities in several countries. 
6 ICD-11 will be adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2018, but countries should proceed with implementing ICD-10 because it will likely take many years for the first countries to implement ICD-11. WHO-FIC reference classifications
As the coordinating authority on international 
health work, the WHO establishes 
international reference classifications on 
health that are endorsed by member states. The WHO-FIC coordinates three main health-
related classifications (WHO, 2016a):
• International Classification of Diseases 
(adopted by the World Health Assembly in 1967)
• International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (adopted by the 
World Health Assembly in 2001)
• International Classification of Health 
Interventions (adopted as a WHO project 
in 2012) Module 1: Individual Records    19Standards for Morbidity Diagnoses
The ICD is the global standard for mortality and morbidity. It provides an international classification and 
corresponding coding system for all possible diagnoses. International Classification of  Diseases, Tenth Revision 
(ICD-10) is the current version that has been in effect since 1990.7 The ICD-10 conditions are grouped in a way 
that is conducive to monitoring epidemiology trends in the population. To initiate coding using ICD, the clinician records an accurate medical diagnosis of  the patient’s conditions. Then, a records clerk or other designated person 
systematically codes the information according to the ICD list of  morbidity conditions. 
Healthcare clients may present multiple health problems. The condition used for morbidity tabulation is the 
main condition (WHO, 2011). If  there is more than one such condition, then the one considered responsible for 
the greatest use of  resources should be selected. If  no diagnosis was made, then the main symptom, abnormal 
finding, or problem should be selected as the main condition.
ICD-10 Tabulation Lists for Morbidity
ICD-10 has approximately 70,000 diagnosis codes. In an effort to simplify tabulations and comparisons of  
diagnostic groups, the ICD-10 Volume 1 provides a special tabulation list for morbidity diagnoses that consists of  a greatly reduced set of  298 principal diagnosis groups defined by their ICD-10 codes (WHO, 2016b). If  
this number of  diagnoses is still too large for a country’s needs or capacity, then the International Shortlist for 
Hospital Morbidity Tabulation (ISHMT), which is a shorter list consisting of  130 diagnostic groups defined by ICD-10 codes, may be most appropriate. The International Shortlist for Hospital Morbidity Tabulation was adopted by the OECD, Eurostat, the Nordic Medico-Statistical Committee, and the WHO in 2005 (WHO, 2016c).
ICD-10 Adaptations for Morbidity 
The WHO has approved several official ICD adaptations that permit more detailed classifications of  cancers, 
external causes of  death, primary care, and mental and behavioral disorders (WHO, 2016a). These adapted classifications, which provide more detail than the corresponding ICD chapters,
8 are useful for maintaining 
specific disease registries. Disease registries contain detailed data on individuals with specific diagnoses and are 
useful in tracking patients’ clinical care and outcomes. They are often established for research purposes and may 
not be maintained on a national level. 
Standards for Health Interventions
Data on patient services provide powerful indicators of  the efficiency of  the healthcare system when used in association with data on diagnoses. The services recorded in the patient record or disease registry constitute the 
primary data that can be classified as unique and quantifiable interventions reflecting the quantity and type of  
healthcare consumed. 
No such international classification exists yet, though the WHO has been working toward a classification of  
interventions and procedures since the 1970s. In 1978, the WHO produced the first International Classification of  
Procedures in Medicine to be used for trials. Additional international work to adapt and expand the classification was postponed, beginning in 1989, during two decades of  rapid new developments in procedures. In 2012, the WHO approved the ICHI Development Project. The ICHI can be adopted by countries that do not have national 
intervention classification, or it can be used to map local classifications to a common intervention classification. 
7 ICD-11 will be adopted by the World Health Assembly in 2018, but countries should proceed with implementing ICD-10 because it 
will likely take many years for the first countries to implement ICD-11. 
8 ICD-10 has 21 chapters. Chapter 2 corresponds to neoplasms (cancers), Chapter 5 corresponds to mental, behavioral and neurodevel-
opmental disorders, and Chapters 21 and 22 correspond to external causes of morbidity and mortality. 20  Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best Practices for Data SourcesInternational Classification of Health Interventions
The WHO ICHI Development Project leads the development of  one of  the three classifications in the WHO-
FIC. The ICHI takes into account all types of  health services, including acute, primary care, rehabilitation, assistance with functioning, prevention, public health, and ancillary services by all types of  providers. The only area not included is traditional medicine interventions. The ICHI is designed so that additional country adaptation 
is not necessary, but adding more detail is possible. 
The ICHI is available as an Alpha (2016) application and is expected to be adopted by the World Health Assembly 
WHA in 2019. Countries are encouraged to install the ICHI Alpha application on computers, especially in hospital settings, and to assess its usability through the current procedures for recording interventions. 
In countries where the full classification of  health interventions is not feasible, health authorities may choose to 
monitor selected indicators of  interventions that are meaningful in the national context. A meaningful indicator for all countries, for example, is caesarean section, because very high or very low proportions of  these deliveries 
are associated with increased maternal mortality, maternal and infant morbidity, and complications for subsequent 
deliveries. 
Diagnosis and Procedural Classifications 
Several countries with a more evolved HIS have developed country-specific modifications of  the ICD-10 that includes both diagnostic and clinical procedure codes (Table 4). The WHO, which owns the ICD copyright, 
limits the modifications it approves, in order to prevent changes in the meaning of  the categories and thereby 
retain a level of  comparison between groups of  conditions. The motivation for a country to develop its own ICD modification is to combine diagnostic information with information on health interventions—a casemix system—as the basis for a nationally tailored reimbursement system. The U.S. ICD-9-CM classification was adopted 
and adapted by several European countries for coding diagnoses and/or procedures: Belgium, Ireland, Italy, 
Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain (Hospital Data Project, 2003).

(developed from the Australian Classification of Health

These diagnostic and procedural classifications allow for a second grouping of  a patients’ conditions and the 
health services delivered to the patient, which is the basis for grouping patient episodes into a clinically relevant, 
resource-homogenous, casemix reimbursement system, such as the diagnosis-related group. The ICHI provides 
the basis for countries to develop a clinical classification for their own casemix requirements, rather than starting from scratch or having to adapt another country’s system.
Best Practices
• Facilities maintain individual patient records that include the patient’s main diagnosis and the primary inter -
vention received.
• A transition to electronic medical records and disease registries is underway or planned to facilitate recording 
and coding of  the main diagnosis and primary medical health intervention for all healthcare clients. 
• The main diagnosis of  each hospital patient (inpatients and admitted day patients) is tabulated according to 
the ICD-10 special tabulation list for morbidity or the ISHMT or can be mapped to those tabulations.
• The primary medical procedure recorded on each individual record can be uniquely classified according to a national classification of  intervention procedures. 
• The country has in place or is exploring possibilities for developing a casemix system based on a patient’s main condition and the primary intervention received. 22  Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best Practices for Data SourcesReferences: Module 1

Standards and Best Practices for Data Sources
This module is one of 12 HIS data source modules in Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best 
Practices for Data Sources. The full series of modules (available at https://www.measureevaluation.org/resources/publications/tr-17-225) is intended to provide health authorities and other health information stakeholders with a reference guide that, along with other sources, can help align the HIS data sources with international standards and best practices.Module 2: Health Infrastructure Information System   25Type of Data Generated: Health Facilities’ Infrastructure and 
Services 
Description
The facility register, or master facility list (MFL), is a complete, up-to-date list of  health facilities that uniquely 
identifies each facility so that all stakeholders operate and make decisions based on the same information. When 
the MFL is programmed into the routine health information system, it facilitates complete and timely reporting 
from all facilities that are required to submit data. In cases of  reporting gaps or delays, it permits the health 
information officer to easily identify which facilities have failed to report. Without an MFL, or with a poorly 
maintained MFL, there is almost certainly the risk of  generating health resource indicators that are biased because of  incomplete data.
The Ministry of  Health is typically the owner and steward of  the MFL. A fully functional MFL contains validated, 
up-to-date information on every facility and is easily available to users in a format that they can manipulate to 
meet their needs. The MFL database contains a minimal set of  data elements that identifies each facility uniquely (signature domain) and may include basic information on service capacity, fixed assets, and amenities (service domain) (WHO, 2013). 
Data from an MFL can be used to reveal inequalities in the types of  health services available to the population. 
The data also provide insights into the density of  services, which are relevant for informing decisions on 
allocation of  capital health investments. Depending on other data elements programmed in the MFL, it can 
provide information on various amenities such as the number of  hospital beds or an inventory of  basic equipment. The inclusion of  Global Positioning System coordinates for each facility permits service availability mapping as well as linking with other data sets for more meaningful analyses.
Another important function of  the MFL is to facilitate linkages between routine health information system 
data sources (U.S. Agency for International Development [USAID], 2017). For example, linking the MFL to the logistical management information system helps healthcare suppliers efficiently manage stocks of  drugs and commodities; linking it to the human resources for health information system helps the health and education 
sectors plan for the number and distribution of  medical professionals; and linking it to facility data on patient 
diagnoses permits the correlation of  resource consumption with major health conditions. Finally, the MFL provides the list from which to draw a representative sample of  facilities for a health facility assessment or census. 
To ensure the effective use of  the MFL by a variety of  stakeholders, and for various purposes, it must be easily 
accessible to a variety of  users and in a readily usable format. A hardcopy or PDF, for example, is not an ideal format for users who need to query or manipulate information in the MFL. The information contained in the 
MFL must also be updated on a predictable basis and include each newly designated facility and flag or exclude 
each facility that closes or becomes obsolete. Each update should be clearly dated.
Types of Indicators
Basic signature domain and selected service domain data elements in the MFL are sufficient to compute indicators related to the type of  health facility and the availability of  health services to the population (density per capita). 
The Ministry of  Health (MOH) may also decide to maintain additional information in the MFL, such as data 
related to physical infrastructure, amenities, and equipment. As shown in Table 5, WHO and USAID have defined several global indicators related to health access (WHO, 2015a; WHO, 2015b; USAID & WHO, 2012).  26  Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best Practices for Data SourcesTable 5.

Alternative Data Sources
Health facility assessments can provide periodic information on health service availability, including the indicators 
listed in Table 2. They can also provide more detailed information on health service readiness (USAID & WHO, 
2012). Health facility assessments are discussed further in Module 6: Health Facility Assessments. 
Standards
The United States Agency for International Development and WHO have published guidelines and a resource 
package to help countries establish an MFL (USAID, 2017; WHO, 2013). These guidelines outline how to develop 
the ideal institutional arrangements; which standard data elements to include in the signature domain and the 
service domain; how to populate and update the MFL; and how to manage, maintain, and disseminate the MFL. 
Kenya, Nigeria, and Zambia, among other countries, have developed an MFL, and documentation about the 
development process is published online (Republic of  Kenya Ministry of  Health, 2016; Makinde, et al., 2014; 
Republic of  Zambia Ministry of  Health, 2013). 
Best Practices
• Elements of  effective MFL governance  are established that include appropriate leadership, stakeholder en-
gagement, a favorable policy environment, and institutionalization to ensure sustainability. 
• The MFL is a comprehensive list  of  facilities and contains a unique identifier  for each one.
• For each facility, the minimal data set of elements  include information on the location, facility type, own-
ership, and functional status. 
• Procedures are in place for regularly updating the MFL,  including updating information on data elements 
and updating the list to include new facilities and omit old ones.
• The MFL is made accessible to users  in a user-friendly format, across Ministry of  Health units, ministries, 
institutions, and partners, with different levels of  access defined according to the user context.Module 2: Health Infrastructure Information System   27References: Module 2

Health Information System Strengthening:
Standards and Best Practices for Data Sources
This module is one of 12 HIS data source modules in Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best 
Practices for Data Sources. The full series of modules (available at https://www.measureevaluation.org/resources/publications/tr-17-225) is intended to provide health authorities and other health information stakeholders with a reference guide that, along with other sources, can help align the HIS data sources with international standards and best practices.Module 3: Human Resources for Health Information System   29Type of Data Generated: Health Occupations and Distribution of 
Workforce
Description
A health workforce must be adequate in numbers, skills, and distribution to deliver high-quality healthcare to a 
population. For this reason, the health workforce is identified as one of  the six health system building blocks 
WHO, 2010a). A human resources information system (HRIS) provides data to track the status of  the workforce 
in terms of  the number, occupation, and geographical distribution of  health workers. 
The international community recognizes the global shortages of  health personnel and that low- and middle-
income countries have difficulties retaining health workers in the face of  better employment conditions in high-income countries. The World Health Assembly adopted the WHO Global Code of  Practice on the International Recruitment of  Health Personnel in 2010, and many WHO member states are committed to implementing 
it (WHO, 2010b). The Code encourages member states to establish or strengthen routine HRIS, including 
information on health personnel migration. 
In 2016, the WHO Secretariat presented the Global Strategy on Human Resources for Health: Workforce 2030 to 
the World Health Assembly for deliberation by member states (WHO, 2016). This strategy calls for the adoption 
of  a national health workforce account (NHWA) and lays out ten modules and their corresponding indicators to 
guide efforts in standardizing the collection and processing of  health workforce data. 
Many ministries of  health and other organizations, such as professional councils and educational bodies, already 
maintain an HRIS to record the status of  health workers and graduates (WHO, World Bank, & USAID, 2009). A well-functioning HRIS constitutes a registry of  health workers that tracks the “lifespan” of  health professionals from the time they are licensed and employed until they leave the health workforce (Fort, Pacue-Margolis, Ng, 
Kauffman, & IntraHealth International, 2015). An electronic HRIS, such as the Human Resource Information 
Solutions (iHRIS) application, provides an efficient way to manage information on the workforce (iHRIS, n.d.).
11 Standardized health workforce data should ultimately be compiled from the HRIS maintained by various 
organizations into a common health workforce registry from which core indicators can be directly calculated at 
national and subnational levels. 
Types of Indicators 
Basic information from a well-functioning HRIS is sufficient to compute the recommended health workforce 
indicators that should be regularly tracked at the national level. Table 6 shows core indicators for monitoring the 
health workforce.  30  Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best Practices for Data SourcesTable 6. Health workforce indicators

Countries can evaluate the functioning of  their HRIS using the Human Resources for Health) Action Framework. 
The United State Agency for International Development and WHO supported the Global Health Workforce 
Alliance in developing this framework to better describe and measure dimensions of  human resources for health, 
including leadership and the enabling environment (Fort, et al., 2015).
Alternative Data Sources
Censuses and labor force or health facility surveys can provide periodic snapshots of  the health workforce, including some of  the indicators listed in Table 6. Censuses are discussed further in Module 7: Population 
Censuses, and surveys are discussed further in Module 8: Population-Based Surveys.Module 3: Human Resources for Health Information System   31Standards 
Three main standard methodologies ensure the consistency and comparability of  health workforce data. 
1. Classification of national occupations to International Standard Classifications of 
Occupations-08 (ISCO-08)
The International Labour Organization (ILO) maintains standard workforce terminology and classification, which 
are provided in the ISCO (International Labour Organization, 2008). To ensure that national health workforce data 
are comparable over time, and across national and subnational areas, countries may classify their health occupations 
according to the ISCO-08. To simplify the mapping of  national health occupations to the ISCO classification, WHO has prepared a map of  approximately 40 health occupations using five major groupings: health professionals, health 
associate professionals, personal care workers in health services, health management and support personnel, and 
health service providers not elsewhere classified (WHO, n.d.) . Each major occupation group is associated with an 
ISCO code. A database of  the active health workforce that adheres to standard occupation groups will also facilitate reporting on international indicators (Settle, Lwetabe, Puckett, & Leitner, 2014). 
2. Health workforce registry
As stated earlier, countries are likely to maintain multiple sources of  health worker data. To compute health worker indicators, they need to compile the data from various sources into a single, national health workforce 
registry (HWR) (WHO, 2015c). The Open Health 
Information Exchange (OpenHIE) provides an electronic solution to develop and maintain an HWR and to easily compile standard information into a common database 
(OpenHIE, 2014). This electronic solution, the OpenHIE 
Health Worker Registry, complies with the WHO Minimum Data Set for HWRs as well as Integrating 
the Health Enterprise, Fast Healthcare Interoperability 
Resources, and other data exchange standards (OpenHIE, n.d.; WHO, 2015c; Integrating the Health Enterprise, n.d.; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, n.d.). The 
box above presents the minimal set of  data elements that 
ensure comparable data across HRIS.
3. Other data related to the health workforce 
Other health workforce data are being standardized in the scope of  the NHWA, led by WHO in partnership with the 
OECD, the World Bank, USAID, ILO, and the United Nations Education, Cultural and Scientific Organization, among 
others (WHO, 2016). The NHWA is inspired by the WHO-OECD-Eurostat System of  Health Accounts (OECD, 
Eurostat, & WHO, 2011) and builds on existing standards and tools, including the WHO Minimum Data Set (WHO, 2015), the WHO Handbook for Monitoring and Evaluation of  Human Resources for Health (WHO, World Bank, 
& USAID, 2009), and the OECD/Eurostat/WHO-Europe Joint Questionnaire (OECD, Eurostat, & WHO, 2017). 
Standardization underway includes:
• Defining the scope of  work relative to qualifications, experience, and education
• Defining current activity (practicing, professionally active, and licensed to practice) 
• Conversion of  head counts to full-time equivalentsData elements in the minimal data 
set for a health workforce registry

Best Practices
• A sufficiently broad human resources for health stakeholder group  is established and includes key 
collaborators who have the authority to manage and establish national systems and standards.
• An HRIS  is in place to track the numbers, skills, and distribution of  health workers. 
• Health worker occupations are standardized in the country and mapped to standard ISCO-08 codes, 
facilitating comparisons and aggregation of  data across organizations and across countries.
• An updated HWR is aligned with the WHO minimum data set for health workers. 
• For an electronic iHRIS, the data elements are standardized, allowing them to easily be compiled in a 
common HRIS. 
• Data producers  generate core national and international health workforce indicators at least annually, at 
national and subnational levels.Module 3: Human Resources for Health Information System  33References: Module 3

The full series of modules (available at https://www.measureevaluation.org/resources/publications/tr-17-225) is intended to provide health authorities and other health information stakeholders with a reference guide that, along with other sources, can help align the HIS data sources with international standards and best practices. 36  Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best Practices for Data SourcesType of Data Generated: Essential Medicines and Health 
Commodities
Description
The logistics management information system (LMIS) collects and provides data on healthcare commodities that 
are routinely supplied to health facilities (Routine Health Information Network, n.d.). The primary purpose of  the 
LMIS is to manage the logistics of  ensuring a smooth supply chain and that the data it generates are also relevant 
for monitoring key indicators of  health system performance, namely essential medicines. 
Essential medicines, including vaccines and contraceptives, are those identified as meeting the priority healthcare 
needs of  the population. They should be available in the healthcare system at all times, in adequate amounts, in the appropriate dosage forms, with assured quality, and at a price that individuals can afford (WHO, 2016). Access to essential medicines, measured by their availability and affordability, is one of  the health system building blocks 
(WHO, 2010). However, data to monitor indicators related to essential medicines are poor in most low- and lower-
middle-income countries (WHO, 2015b). In the absence of  routine data, many countries have conducted surveys to measure prices and availability of  essential medicines using samples of  health facilities (WHO & Health Action International, 2008).
To improve routine measurement of  medicine availability and affordability, an electronic LMIS, such as 
OpenLMIS or Logistimo, can be programmed to provide timely data on both stocks and prices of  medicines 
in medicine outlets, including pharmacies and health facilities (OpenLMIS, n.d.; Logistimo, n.d.). In addition to 
providing complete and timely data on essential medicines, an electronic LMIS can interoperate with a patient management system, such as DHIS 2, to effectively link the availability of  and demand for medicines with health service delivery (Village Reach, 2017; John Snow, Inc., 2017). 
Affordability is another dimension of  access to essential medicines (Niens, et al., 2012; Cameron, et al., 2011). 
In 2001, WHO member states endorsed a resolution to develop a standardized methodology for measuring medicine prices, which is a crucial component of  affordability (WHO, 2001). Although there is not yet an agreed-on methodology for measuring prices, an electronic LMIS can provide routine information on the range of  prices 
and median prices for medicines by recording financial data on the distributed cost and treatment price for each 
medicine. This fundamental evidence can help define regulations and policies to ensure affordable medicines and promote equity in pricing. 
Types of Indicators 
To monitor access to essential medicines, countries select tracer medicines from the national and global essential medicine list (EML), including brand-name and generic products for each medicine (WHO, 2015c). Health 
information officers measure availability of  these medicines through indicators of  stocks on hand, stockouts, and 
other indicators (USAID, 2008). They measure affordability through median unit prices and consumer price ratios. 
Consumer price ratios are calculated as the median local unit price divided by the Management Sciences for 
Health (MSH) international reference price. MSH has published the International Drug Price Indicator Guide 
with WHO since 2000 and updates it annually (Management Sciences for Heath International [MSH], 2015). The 
international reference prices represent median prices of  selected medicines offered to developing and middle-income countries by different suppliers. These ratios show the price of  local medicine relative to the international reference price and are considered good comparative information on prices. 
Table 7 shows several indicators for monitoring the availability and affordability of  selected medicines.Module 4: Logistics Management Information System   37Table 7. Essential medicine availability and affordability indicators

Alternative Data Sources
Until a country has a national LMIS that routinely collects data on medicine stocks and prices from all public and private 
facilities that dispense medicines, it must rely on surveys to derive that information. The WHO and Health Action 
International Project on Medicine Prices and Availability have developed a standard survey methodology to measure price 
components of  50 essential medicines in public, private, and other sectors. The survey has been conducted in more than 50 countries, and the internationally comparable results are publicly available (WHO & Health Action International, 2008).
Standards 
1. The national list of  essential medicines, or in its absence, the WHO global list, serves as the basis for monitoring availability and affordability. Since 1997, the WHO has produced a global EML, with updates 
about every two years. The most current EML is the WHO Model List of  April 2015, which includes 340 
medicines that treat priority conditions, including malaria, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, reproductive health, and chronic diseases such as cancer and diabetes (WHO, 2015c). 
2. The U.S. Agency for International Development funded a series of  technical guides and tools aimed at developing essential health commodity supply chains. Project publications address strengthening logistics management 
information systems, streamlining distribution systems, identifying financial resources for procurement and supply 
chain operation, and enhancing forecasting and procurement planning (USAID, 2008; USAID, 2009; USAID, 2011). USAID also funded A Guide to Improving Drug Management in Decentralized Health Systems: The Monitoring-Training-Planning Guide for Program Implementation (Nelson & Adams, 2000).
9 The 14 global essential medicines are from the 2010 global core list of medicines. This list should be checked for updates, and 
countries should select tracer medicines that are most relevant to their needs (MEASURE Evaluation, n.d.). 38  Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best Practices for Data SourcesBest Practices
• A national EML  is adapted to national needs and formally adopted as part of  the national medicine policy; 
both are updated every five years.
• The logistics management unit has a strategic plan  that covers the next one to three years. 
• The national logistics management unit maintains an LMIS with data on essential medicines, including routine 
information on stock status and medicine prices. 
• All medicine outlets,  including health facilities and pharmacies, are required to report in the LMIS.
• LMIS data are used regularly to derive indicators of  availability and affordability of selected essential 
medicines. 
• LMIS data are periodically reconciled against physical inventories and validated using a standard survey 
methodology, such as WHO and Health Action International’s health facility assessment. 
• Logistics data are linked  to health service delivery data to match demand for essential medicines with 
availability. 
• A logistics system assessment  is conducted regularly using a tool such as USAID’s Logistics System 
Assessment Tool, and results are used to update the program of  work and for strategic planning exercises.Module 4: Logistics Management Information System   39References: Module 4

Description
A financial management information system (FMIS) enables governments to formulate budgets and monitor 
revenues and expenditures by sector (Dener & Young Min, 2013). In the health sector, it routinely provides 
health authorities with information on financial transactions that help manage efficiency in health service delivery 
(WHO & Health Metrics Network, 2008). A fully functioning FMIS is inextricably linked to countries’ success in achieving the Sustainable Development Goal of  universal health coverage (UHC) by 2030: coverage of  quality health services and financial protection for all (United Nations [UN] Economic and Social Council, 2016; WHO & World Bank, 2015). 
Many developing and transitional countries are putting in place an integrated FMIS so their governments can strengthen financial controls and raise levels of  financial governance, transparency, and accountability (USAID, 2008). An integrated FMIS computerizes budgets and standardizes accounting operations so that central governments and different public 
sectors, including the ministry of  health, can contribute to and access financial information using a common platform. 
Starting with allocations of  budget funds, the sectors post financial transactions using the appropriate, tailored account in the standard chart of  accounts to the general ledger.
The general ledger is the source for deriving financial indicators and reports. A more complex FMIS may address additional 
functions such as debt, resource management, human resources, payroll, and auditing processes across central government, 
and it may include local government and other public sector and quasi-governmental agencies (USAID, 2008). 
The World Bank, International Monetary Fund, and USAID have supported many low- and middle-income 
countries (LMICs) in the development of  an integrated FMIS, usually under the Ministry of  Finance (USAID, 2008; 
Diamond & Khemani, 2005; Dener & Young Min, 2013). Establishing an integrated FMIS is a long-term and costly 
process and few are sustained—not because of  a lack of  technological solutions, but rather because of  factors related to adequate leadership, coordination, and long-term commitment to sustain the system (USAID, 2008). 
At a minimum, to inform management decisions in the health sector, the FMIS should produce reports that 
include the following:
• Income or revenue data with costs allocated by cost centers (such as products or outputs, service units, and 
sets of  services)
• Comparison of  expenditures by budget line items (e.g., salaries, materials, health resources) with budgets 
(MEASURE Evaluation, n.d.)
Universal Health Coverage and Health Financing Reforms
Universal healthcare is organized around providing all members of  society a basic package of  promotive, 
preventive, curative, rehabilitative, and palliative services, while ensuring that the use of  these services does not result in financial hardship (WHO, 2017). UN member states have agreed to work toward UHC by 2030. 
The FMIS should be designed to accommodate health financing reforms that are linked to the UHC goal. The 
WHO has issued recommendations and resolutions on UHC that urge countries to avoid significant direct payments at the point of  service delivery and to develop health financing systems that pool prepaid financial contributions and equitably distribute them across the population (WHO, 2010a; World Health Assembly, 2005; World Health 
Assembly, 2011).
10 The UN General Assembly further encourages countries to track the flow of  health expenditures 
through the application of  standard accounting frameworks in a move toward providing universal coverage (UN General Assembly, 2012).
11 Such reforms should minimize out-of-pocket expenditures that risk preventing groups of  
people from receiving needed services or putting them in financial hardship (Mathauer & Carrin, 2010). 
10  World Health Assembly resolution 58.33 in 2005, World Health Assembly resolution 64.9 in 2011
11  UN General Assembly resolution 67/81 in 2012Module 5: Financial Management Information System   43Health financing mechanisms maintain three core functions: (1) raise healthcare revenues, (2) pool healthcare 
resources, and (3) purchase healthcare. Countries raise revenues from a variety of  sources, including general tax 
revenues, social health insurance, private health insurance, community-based health insurance, out-of-pocket 
spending, and external aid (World Bank, 2011). Countries also pool prepaid financial resources, such as taxes, insurance contributions, and external funds, in various ways to spread risk across the population. 
For the third core function—purchasing healthcare—governments and ministries of  health make choices that are 
likely to involve one or more of  four main payment mechanisms to providers (Table 8). 
Table 8. Provider payment mechanisms
Mechanism Description Payment unit
Global or line-item 
budgetsProspective, fixed payments based on historical patterns and number and type of employees All services combined, to all patients or consumers, for a defined period
Capitation Retrospective payments adjusted for location and patients’ income levels All services combined, per “average” patient or consumer, over time
Case reimbursement Retrospective or prospective payments based on predefined diagnostic-related groupsPer patient or consumer, per admission
Fee-for-service Retrospective payment for each health service providedEach health service or resource consumed
Source: Adapted from Waters & Hussey, 2004, pp. 3–4
Regardless of  the mix of  mechanisms that countries use to pay for healthcare, purchasers require information 
from providers to accurately predict expected costs by cost centers and service units. In LMICs, the principal 
constraint on estimating costs is that adequate data are not available on administrative inputs, types and volume 
of  services, and patient conditions (Ferranti, 1985). Limited by information gaps, LMICs commonly use line-item and global budgets to reimburse hospitals and district health offices (Waters & Hussey, 2004). This payment system is the simplest for governments to administer because payments are based on historical levels of  financing 
rather than on costs related to specific healthcare consumption. 
For LMICs to move to more efficient reimbursement systems, such as capitation or case reimbursement, they 
need to implement standard coding and classifications and address problems related to data a vailability and 
information technology (Mathauer & Wittenbecher, 2013). Resolving these challenges will help purchasers to set 
fair prices for reimbursing providers for health services (Waters & Hussey, 2004). 
The healthcare purchaser can take two main approaches for establishing prices. One is a top-down approach in 
which total expenditures are disaggregated by patient visits or patient hospital days per cost center (e.g., inpatient 
wards, outpatient services, laboratory services, ancillary services). The other approach is a bottom-up approach 
in which utilization costs of  each intervention, commodity, or administrative input consumed by the patient are aggregated. Either approach requires allocating costs to cost centers in the FMIS. 
A bottom-up approach using patient-level data could be used to establish the average cost of  a casemix group. 
Thereafter, a top-down approach could be used to prospectively or retrospectively reimburse providers according 
to a casemix system, such as through diagnostic-related groups. Each casemix group includes activities that cut across the organizational structure of  a healthcare provider, such as those related to patient evaluation, admission, and treatment; the preparation, use, and maintenance of  medical equipment and facilities; medical procedures 
and supplies; and hospitalization. Several LMICs have developed simple casemix payment systems for different 
procedures that could be expanded into diagnostic-related group-based payment systems (Waters & Hussey, 2004; Mathauer & Wittenbecher, 2013).  44  Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best Practices for Data SourcesTypes of Indicators
The FMIS provides public financing information needed to derive several of  the internationally agreed-on health 
expenditure indicators defined in the internationally recognized framework, the System of  Health Accounts 
(SHA) (OECD, Eurostat, & WHO, 2011) (Table 9). Some countries prefer to produce these indicators directly 
from the System of  National Accounts (SNA), but they are not strictly comparable with the SHA indicators, owing to differences in the scope of  healthcare goods and services included, the transactions selected, and estimation methods used (WHO, 2010b; OECD, Eurostat, & WHO, 2011; European Commission, International 
Monetary Fund, OECD, UN, & World Bank, 2008). Detailed descriptions of  most of  the SHA indicators can be 
found in the WHO Indicator Code Book National Health Accounts (WHO, 2015).

Alternative Data Sources
Other sources of  data can be found in Health Accounts and SNA results and ad hoc studies in government health 
financing.
Standards 
It is difficult to identify standards for FMIS because each system evolves in different ways, over long periods of  time. This section describes several standards we have identified that are relevant for countries developing an 
FMIS with a health account. 
Accounting Standards
Chart of  Accounts (COA)—The COA is the foundation for any accounting system, including the FMIS. It is a 
list of  all accounts tracked by the system, including the health account. Each account in the chart is assigned a 
unique identifier, or an account number, involving a series of  information tags that denote certain things about 
the data being entered into the system. For example, these tags may denote the cost center, the department or unit responsible for the transaction, the program or purpose for which the transaction is being made, or the nature of  the transaction. The account number attaches to the data and serves accounting, management, and all other 
reporting purposes. It also forms part of  the data validation process, providing information on details such as 
whether a vendor exists, whether there is an authorized budget, and whether funds have been committed. Without an appropriately designed COA, created with consensus of  key stakeholders, information cannot be stored or accessed properly (USAID, 2008).Module 5: Financial Management Information System   45International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). IFRS is the global standard accounting framework. It replaced the 
International Accounting Standards in 2001. Most countries around the world require domestic public companies 
to use IFRS, and they are also recommended for implementing an integrated FMIS (International Financial 
Reporting Standards [IFRS] Foundation, 2017; USAID, 2008). 
Open Data Standards 
A common data structure facilitates information sharing, further use of  data, and comparability over time. The FMIS should follow the principle of  open data standards, which include the following:
• Public finance information covers all public-sector revenues, expenditures, assets, and liabilities. 
• Budget data include primarily general government revenues and expenditures. 
• FMIS platforms are subject to regular information technology audits to ensure the reliability and integrity 
of  systems, the security of  operations, and the effectiveness of  information technology governance and oversight functions. 
• Open data are accessible to the public (online) in editable (machine-readable) and reusable format, without any restriction (free and legally open) (Dener & Young Min, 2013).
System of Health Accounts 
The SHA draws on FMIS public expenditure data to produce information on three dimensions of  healthcare: functions of  care, providers of  services, and sources of  funding (OECD, Eurostat, & WHO, 2011). Countries that 
are not using the SHA methodology can use the SNA framework or another national health account framework 
to produce health financing indicators (European Commission, Inter national Monetary Fund, OECD, UN, & 
World Bank, 2008). Health expenditures accounted for in the SNA framework can be mapped to SHA to obtain comparable levels and structures of  healthcare spending. 
Best Practices
Drawing from observations from a World Bank study, as well as other resources, the following best practices are identified for developing an FMIS (Dener & Young Min, 2013):
• The FMIS complies with
 open data standards  and publishes timely and regular reports on budget 
implementation. 
• Responsible staff  are trained in accounting principles and reporting requirements, which are clearly 
stated in a reference document. 
• Expenditures are tracked  by budget line items and are recorded as they occur. 
• Expenditures are also linked to defined cost centers and units of  service. 
• Financial reports regularly compare actual expenditures to the budget. 
• Financial reports are consistently used for management decisions,  including allocation of  resources. 46  Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best Practices for Data SourcesReferences: Module 5

The full series of modules (available at https://www.measureevaluation.org/resources/publications/tr-17-225) is intended to provide health authorities and other health information stakeholders with a reference guide that, along with other sources, can help align the HIS data sources with international standards and best practices.Module 6: Health Facility Assessments   49Type of Data Generated: Health Resources Inventories
Description
A health facility assessment (HFA) provides periodic information on the status of  service delivery across a 
country’s network of  health facilities. The information collected reflects both inputs made to the health system—
in terms of  infrastructure, personnel, medicines, and equipment—and outputs of  the health system to the 
population in terms of  availability of  different types of  services and quality of  services provided (MEASURE Evaluation & USAID, 2008).
Although much of  the information collected through service-related inventories can be collected efficiently 
through a well-functioning RHIS, the advantages of  collecting information through an HFA are to (1) enhance the scope of  information on health system inputs and outputs (beyond data that are routinely collected), (2) 
periodically validate comparable data in the RHIS, and (3) provide subjective information on staff  and patient 
satisfaction and on patient consultation processes. 
HFA data are collected through a facility census or survey in which trained enumerators visit facilities and conduct 
activities, including various inventories, interviews with staff  and patients, and observation of  service delivery. 
Table 10 summarizes the difference between a health facility survey (enumeration of  a sample of  facilities) and 
health facility census (enumeration of  all facilities). 
Table 10. Summary of differences between health facility census and health facility survey

master facility list to identify 
all healthcare facilities; Access to all facilities may be problematic.
Health facility survey Periodic survey of a 
representative sample 
of public and private healthcare facilities within a countryMay collect more detailed 
information than a 
facility census, including verification of service statistics, assessment of 
quality of care from staff 
and patient interviews, and observations on service provision Time consuming and costly; 
Information likely to be 
representative only at the national level. Requires a complete and updated 
master facility list for the 
sampling frame. Access to selected facilities may be problematic.

 50  Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best Practices for Data SourcesTypes of Indicators
Indicators derived from HFAs measure aspects of  the health system, including the following: 
• Health service infrastructure, amenities, and equipment
• Availability of  health workers, standard precautions, and essential medicines
• Availability of  and readiness to deliver various types of  health services and diagnostic capacity
• Satisfaction of  clients and service providers with the service delivery environment
• Accuracy with which service inputs and outputs are being recorded and reported (RHIS data quality)
Alternative Data Sources
Health resource inventories can be programmed through the RHIS for routine collection or through the separate 
data subsystem, which includes the human resources information system, the logistical management information 
system, and the MFL. Special surveys of  patients and providers can be conducted to assess satisfaction with 
services, and data quality can be assessed through record reviews and supervisory visits.
Standards 
Facility Census
A facility census is designed to enumerate all public and private facilities in the country. Inventory data from the 
facility census should correspond with each facility listed in the MFL, so it provides reliable measures of  health 
service availability, as well as baseline information, with which future progress can be compared. The WHO 
recommends updating the facility census database every five years using the updated MFL as a reference list. In the interim, more in-depth surveys can also be conducted. 
The WHO Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) methodology and instruments are designed to 
collect basic data on service availability and readiness (WHO, 2015a; WHO, 2015b). A facility census conducted 
with SARA instruments measures the availability and readiness of  specific service areas, including family planning, neonatal and child health, HIV and prevention of  mother-to-child transmission, tuberculosis and malaria, basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric care, and noncommunicable diseases. In practice, however, a full SARA 
census is not often conducted because it is time consuming and costly.
SARA instruments also collect data on health workforce staff, adherence to standard precautions, and the 
availability of  essential medicines and basic supplies and equipment. Key tracer indicators from each of  these 
domains indicate basic elements of  service quality and are used to compute composite indicators developed by WHO and USAID for service readiness (WHO, 2015a).
Facility Survey 
A facility survey is conducted on a nationally representative sample of  facilities using the MFL as a facility sampling frame. The Service Provision Assessment (SPA) is a comprehensive facility survey methodology 
designed to collect basic data on service availability and readiness as well as a wider range of  quality measures 
(Demographic and Health Surveys [DHS] Program, n.d.a). 
The SPA contains several questionnaire instruments. The inventory questionnaire is harmonized with WHO 
and USAID service readiness indicators (USAID & WHO, 2012). Other SPA instruments include (1) the SPA Module 6: Health Facility Assessments   51observation questionnaire to determine the extent to which patient consultations follow generally accepted 
standards of  care for antenatal care, integrated management of  child illnesses, and family planning; (2) the SPA 
exit interview questionnaire to provide information on the client’s perception of  the service delivery environment; 
and (3) the SPA health provider questionnaire to measure professional qualifications of  staff  and attitudes about the work environment. 
Model SARA and SPA country reports can be found on the WHO Health Statistics and Information website 
(WHO, 2016) and the USAID-funded DHS Program website (DHS Program, n.d.b).
Best Practices 
• Maintain an MFL  with unique identifiers and basic service provision information for each public and private 
facility, including hospitals, health centers, laboratories, and pharmacies. The updated MFL serves as the reference list for a facility census and serves as a facility sampling frame for a facility survey.
• 
Conduct a facility assessment every five years  using standard SARA or SPA instruments to validate or 
augment information captured through the RHIS. 
• Conduct an in-depth facility survey periodically  using SPA instruments to collect a wider range of  
quality measures for health services.  52  Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best Practices for Data Sources

Interventions
Description
A population census, often combined with a housing census, is  usually conducted by the national statistics office 
every 10 years. It consists of  an individual enumeration of  the entire population, with the objective of  providing 
an accurate count of  the population at a fixed point in time. It is the most logistically complicated and expensive 
data collection operation that a country can undertake (UN, 2014a). Several countries in Europe conduct an 
“administrative census,” in which they obtain a count of  the population from a complete population registry 
instead of, or sometimes in addition to, a traditional enumeration (Valente, 2010). 
The results from the enumeration constitute a base population, comprising counts of  persons for each precisely 
delineated administrative unit, or enumeration area, without omissions or overlaps of  land or population. The 
base population usually refers to the “usual resident population count” that includes all usual residents at the time 
of  the enumeration, as well as their age, sex, occupation, and basic living standards. The list of  enumeration areas, with their corresponding population count, serves as the baseline for intercensal estimates and projections and also a sampling frame for selecting survey samples. 
The UN recommends that a population census include 31 core topics, and the two topics of  greatest interest for 
computing health indicators are “demographic and social characteristics” and “fertility and mortality” (UN, 2014a). 
Population Estimates and Projections
Intercensal estimates are annual estimates of  the mean population by age and sex for the years between censuses. They provide important denominator information to calculate time series for many health-related and other 
indicators. Demographers calculate intercensal estimates using a standard demographic method called the cohort 
component method. This method takes into account natural population change and net migration. The cohort component method starts with the base population and every year thereafter takes the resident population at mid-year of  the previous year and advances the population by one year of  age. That is, births during the year prior to 
July 1 are added to the population, deaths during the same period are removed, and the number of  net migrants is 
accounted for. 
The intercensal estimates from the cohort component method are only as accurate as the base population count 
and the input information on births, deaths, and migrants. Direct demographic estimates require information on 
the number of  births and deaths by age and sex from the CRVS system after any adjustments for under coverage 
have been made. These numbers are supplemented by the number of  net migrants, which, at the subnational level, 
is often the most important and most difficult population component to measure (Jarabi, n.d.). If  the numbers of  
demographic events are not readily available, indirect techniques can be used to estimate fertility, mortality, and migration inputs. 
Population projections are similar to intercensal estimates but are used to inform future planning and resource 
allocation and for target setting. They are also calculated using the cohort component method, but, unlike 
estimates, projections are calculated using assumptions about future trends of  fertility, mortality, and migration rather than the actual levels. 
A number of  valuable resources are available to analyze and use census data. MEASURE Evaluation’s online 
course, Cohort Component Population Projection Method, presents a straightforward approach to this method, 
requiring minimal demographic information (MEASURE Evaluation, n.d.). The International Union for the Scientific Study of  Population provides Internet-based tools with step-by-step instructions for a variety of  
demographic estimation techniques, all downloadable from its website (International Union on the Scientific Module 7: Population Censuses   55Study of  Population, 2013). The International Programs Center of  the U.S. Census Bureau provides a suite of  
pre-programmed Microsoft Excel sheets for basic demographic analysis of  census data, including data on age 
structure, mortality, fertility, migration, geographic distribution of  the population, urbanization, and population 
projections (U.S. Census Bureau, 2013a; U.S. Census Bureau, 2013b). In addition, a number of  older resources from the United Nations are still relevant, especially for guidance on indirect computations of  demographic indicators from census data (UN, 1955, pp. 184 –199; UN, 1983; UN, 2004). 
Small Area Population Estimates
For official purposes, population-based health statistics should be produced for national and subnational administrative divisions as long as population estimates can provide accurate denominator data to calculate them. 
However, national statistics offices usually do not provide official estimates and projections for areas below the 
national or provincial level because precise data on births, deaths, and migration are not usually available for small administrative areas (Rayer, 2015).
12 In addition, health catchment areas are often different from official 
administrative boundaries, so it may be meaningful for the health sector to produce indicators for planning and 
operational purposes using local estimates of  the catchment population. Both official statistics and operational 
statistics are valid to serve their respective purposes. 
Types of Indicators
The most basic indicators derived from a census are the counts, in absolute numbers, of  usual residents. Decision makers need this information for planning future service delivery and resource allocation, especially because aging 
populations are causing priorities to shift in the health system. 
In addition to population counts, census data are a fundamental source of  health information in two ways. First, 
they provide denominator data for a number of  indicators presented in other HIS data source modules. Second, the intercensal estimates are used to calculate key fertility and mortality indicators. For example, indicators related 
to the basic tabulations from core census topics are as follows:
• Total population by age, sex, locality, and other background characteristics
• Median age of  population
• Crude birth rate
• Total fertility rate (children ever born)
• Sex ratio at birth
• Crude death rate
• Childhood mortality
• Age- and sex-specific death rates
• Life expectancy at any age 
Alternative Data Sources
Population-based surveys can provide periodic indicators on mortality and fertility.
12 See Swanson (2008) for information on regression-based techniques that can be used to estimate small area populations, such as the 
Ratio-Correlation Method. 56  Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best Practices for Data SourcesStandards 
Data collection and processing. The UN Statistics Division developed and maintains a compendium of  
standards on conducting a census (UN, 2014a). It includes recommendations for planning and operationalizing 
the population and household enumerations, and it presents important concepts and definitions that should be 
applied consistently in a country’s integrated program for data collection and analysis. It also provides a detailed set of  tabulations that maximize information collected on core census topics. 
Data confidentiality. Although the census enumeration is mandated by a national law and obliges every 
resident to respond, Principle 6 of  the UN Fundamental Principles of  Official Statistics resolves that personal 
data collected are to be kept strictly confidential and used for statistical purposes only (UN, 2014b). 
Age standardization. Fertility, mortality, and other health-related indicators require age-specific population 
estimates in their denominators. However, because population age structures differ across areas and change over time, they need to be normalized to reliably monitor progress or compare levels nationally or internationally. 
Indicators can be made directly comparable by applying standard population weights using a standard (or 
reference) population. Any standard population can be used, such as the international WHO standard population (Ahmad, et al., 2001) or other regional reference population. Naing (2000) provides useful instructions on how and why to apply age-standardization methods.
Best Practices 
• Census legislation has provisions for ensuring data security and confidentiality,  in accordance with the 
UN Fundamental Principles of  Official Statistics.
• The census is designed using UN-recommended population census topics  and the published results 
include UN-recommended  tabulations. 
• Updated population estimates and projections  are calculated at a minimum for the national level and 
the first official subdivision level. Health information officers make estimates available to health managers at 
every level. 
• Indicator metadata for mortality and fertility indicators stipulate the use of official population estimates  
in the denominators.
• Social and demographic indicators from the census are compared  to comparable measures from 
household surveys to help ascertain data quality of  both sources. 
• Numbers of births and deaths are compared  to comparable numbers from the CRVS system, at the 
national and subnational levels, to help determine completeness of  the CRVS.
• To control for different population age structures, a standardized population is applied  when 
comparing fertility, mortality, or other health indicators over time, or when comparing levels across subnational areas or internationally. Module 7: Population Censuses   57References: Module 7

Standards and Best Practices for Data Sources
This module is one of 12 HIS data source modules in Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best 
Practices for Data Sources. The full series of modules (available at https://www.measureevaluation.org/resources/publications/tr-17-225) is intended to provide health authorities and other health information stakeholders with a reference guide that, along with other sources, can help align the HIS data sources with international standards and best practices.Module 8: Population-Based Surveys   59Type of Data Generated: Risk Factors, Service Coverage, and 
Knowledge, Attitude, and Practices
Description
National population surveys produce nationally representative and internationally comparable estimates of  
demographic, health, and social indicators. The data collection methodology consists of  trained enumerators 
administering interviews using standardized questionnaire instruments to eligible individuals selected in a 
scientifically designed sample. Interviewers may record responses using paper-and-pencil interviewing (PAPI) or 
capture them electronically through computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI). 
Measures derived from these survey data consist of  point estimates for indicators expressed as rates, ratios, and 
probabilities. Each survey estimate has defined confidence bounds that represent the known margin of  uncertainty and should be considered when interpreting the significance of  key indicators.
13 Confidence bounds take into 
account sampling error, which is a statistical error associated with any probabilistic sample. Non-sampling errors, on 
the other hand, are a result of  human errors committed while conducting the survey, such as failure to elicit or record 
correct responses, or mistakes in data entry. The latter type of  error cannot be reliably quantified, and great care should be taken to minimize errors through conscientious design, training, and implementation. 
Survey Implementers
The national statistics office (NSO) is usually the agency responsible for conducting a national survey, because it is most likely to have the logistical capacity needed for large-scale data collection operations, including sampling 
expertise, access to the sample frame, and experience with data entry and database management. The NSO also 
usually has a roster of  available short-term agents to employ for enumeration and data entry. Finally, because the NSO is the producer of  official statistics, the results automatically comprise part of  the evidence base owned by the government. This is in contrast to an outside entity, independent of  the government, whose results may not 
be readily accepted. 
However, the NSO does not have the specialized knowledge of  specific areas of  health to develop the 
questionnaire content. Therefore, it is important that specialists from the Ministry of  Health and other sectors are involved in the early design stages and in the analysis and interpretation phases.
Advantages 
• Internationally comparable time-series information. Survey data can provide health, nutrition, and 
demographic information on populations, even when national administrative structures are weak, for example, in the absence of  a functioning routine health information system or civil registration and vital statistics system. 
• 
Health inequalities. Survey data can provide indicators disaggregated by background characteristics that 
reveal inequalities between geographic areas, socioeconomic groups, and other subpopulations. 
• Determinants of health. Survey data can link respondents’ characteristics to their health outcomes, 
offering the potential to estimate independent effects of  various determinants on health, ill-health, and 
mortality outcomes. 
• Unique source of population-based information. Surveys are the most appropriate, if  not the only, 
data source for monitoring health trends in the population, including nonmedical determinants of  health, such as exposure to chronic disease risk factors, knowledge about disease transmission and treatment, self-
reported health and prevalence of  symptoms, and coverage of  services. 
13 Smaller-scale surveys are sometimes conducted using simpler sampling approaches, such as the lot quality assurance sampling 
approach. Although this is a cost-effective way to establish whether a certain indicator falls above or below a preestablished level, it is not designed to measure trends over time, because population parameters cannot be calculated with statistical precision. 60  Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best Practices for Data Sources• Validation of independent data collection mechanisms.  Survey data can produce fertility and mortality 
measures independent of  those generated by the routine vital statistics system. They can therefore validate the 
completeness of  other national data collection systems by comparing levels of  comparable measures.
Disadvantages
Measures generated from national household surveys cannot replace reliable administrative systems for routine 
data collection for the following reasons: 
• Only a periodic data source. Surveys provide data usually only about once every five years. The ideal 
timing of  the implementation of  a survey may be compromised by weather factors affecting field conditions, 
availability of  financial and human resources, or an election period. 
• Labor and cost intensive. Surveys are an expensive and labor-intensive operation, and they often rely on 
external assistance at various phases of  implementation, notably for sample and questionnaire design, data processing, and analysis of  final data. 
• 
Imprecision caused by sampling error. Even the best-designed and best-resourced surveys are subject 
to sampling error, with imprecision increasing at smaller subnational levels. 
Types of Indicators
Survey data are a unique source of  nationally representative information about the population’s social and 
behavioral determinants, health knowledge and healthcare-seeking behavior, and coverage of  health services. Core 
indicator categories include the following:
• Household characteristics, including water and sanitation
• Household members’ characteristics, including education level 
• Fertility, fertility preferences, and proximate determinants of  fertility
• Contraceptive method knowledge and use
• Early childhood mortality
• Maternal and child health and nutrition
• Early childhood development and child disability
• Child protection
• Malaria and HIV/AIDS
Survey modules can also derive information related to domestic violence, health expenditures, maternal mortality, 
noncommunicable disease risk factors, disabilities, and newborn care. 
National household surveys are also a vehicle to collect biomarkers of  nutritional status and prevalence of  
conditions such as anemia, HIV , malaria parasites, and other conditions (MEASURE Evaluation, 2000).
Alternative Data Sources
The civil registration and vital statistics system should be the primary source of  data for the fertility and mortality indicators; the census provides household and household member characteristics every 10 years. Module 8: Population-Based Surveys   61Standards 
National household surveys have their roots largely in the World Fertility Survey (WFS) program, established by 
the International Statistical Institute in 1973 with funding from USAID and the United Nations Population Fund 
to complete 42 surveys (Grebenik, 1981). In 1984, the WFS evolved into the USAID-funded DHS Program, 
which has supported more than 300 surveys conducted in about 90 countries (DHS, n.d.). The DHS Program updates the methodology and instruments continuously according to developments in national and international priorities, new technologies, and ways to obtain the most efficient, high-quality results. Since the mid-1990s, the 
United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) is another large-scale 
household survey program that has supported about 300 surveys conducted in more than 100 countries, focusing on the situation of  women and children (United Nations Children’s Fund [UNICEF], 2014). The DHS and MICS methodologies and the indicators that are common to both surveys are largely harmonized. In the 2000s, 
other large-scale surveys using similar methodologies have been the WHO World Health Survey, implemented 
in 70 countries between 2002 and 2004 (WHO, 2017a); the WHO STEPwise approach to noncommunicable disease risk factor surveillance survey for monitoring noncommunicable disease risk factors, implemented in 102 
countries since 2004 (WHO, 2017b); and Eurostat’s European Health Interview Survey that member states of  the 
European Union conduct regularly (Eurostat, 2015).
14 
These large-scale surveys apply standard approaches in each phase of  survey implementation to obtain reliable data, described as follows:
Sample design.  A probability sample of  households provides valid data, and a two-stage cluster procedure 
is a typical, cost-efficient approach. In the first stage, primary sample units (PSUs) are selected from an official 
sampling frame, commonly a census frame, containing a complete and up-to-date list of  enumeration areas for 
the entire target population. Primary sample units are selected randomly using a probability proportional to size method. For each selected PSU, a household listing field operation should be conducted before the survey to update the dwellings and households within the boundaries. In the second stage, a predetermined number of  
households—usually 20 –30—is selected systematically (with a random start) from the final lists of  households in 
each PSU, or cluster (ICF International, 2012; UNICEF, n.d.a).
The sample design provides for sample weights, which are inflation factors that permit the results to be 
extrapolated to the target population. Sample weights also include a design weight that corrects for nonresponse 
to reduce response bias. Sample weights are calculated separately for household and individual records. 
Questionnaire design.  The major survey programs such as the ones mentioned above have largely harmonized 
questionnaire instruments, including the wording of  questions, composition of  question sets, and questionnaire modules. The International Household Survey Network developed and maintains a question bank to disseminate 
standard questions and questionnaire modules (International Household Survey Network, n.d.). Indicator definitions and computations are also increasingly aligned among the various survey programs. The standard instruments, usually 
consisting of  a household questionnaire and individual questionnaires, are available online and can be adapted for use 
in each country (for example, ICF International, n.d.; UNICEF, n.d.b; WHO, n.d.; Eurostat, 2010). 
Data processing and analysis.  Principles of  data processing that are currently widely applied are deeply 
rooted in WFS, DHS, and MICS practices. These major survey programs, as well as censuses and many other 
surveys, use the Census and Survey Processing System (CSPro) software to process survey data, including data 
entry, automated consistency checks, editing and imputation, tabulation, and computing sample errors. CSPro has evolved with survey and census data collection and is designed to handle a multitude of  complex applications with hierarchical data entry. CSPro applications for processing PAPI or CAPI data are available to download for free 
from the U.S. Census Bureau International Programs website (United States Census Bureau, 2017).

ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/European_health_interview_survey_-_methodology  62  Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best Practices for Data SourcesPAPI data entry should be verified by two different data clerks who enter data independently from all 
questionnaire instruments (double data entry). The results of  both entries are then compared, and any 
discrepancies are manually resolved. 
Final datasets should be recoded into standard recode files for dissemination to outside users . Standard recode 
files started with the WFS and have been continued by the DHS in order to facilitate cross-country comparisons 
(ICF, 2013). For example, recode data have allowed multiple DHS datasets to be analyzed efficiently using 
common variable names, definitions, and comparable response categories. 
Standard routines for editing incomplete and inconsistent data, including flag ging imputations where necessary, 
are documented by DHS (Croft, n.d.). Standard calculations of  national and global indicators are also published 
by DHS (Rutstein & Rojas, 2006; Rutstein & Johnson, 2004). 
Best Practices
• A probabilistic sample  is designed based on an updated sampling frame, with a sample size large enough 
to ensure adequate precision of  key indicators for defined populations. 
• Questionnaire instruments are designed based on standard question sets to ensure that indicators can be 
properly computed and are comparable across other data sets.
• In order for field staff  to adequately assimilate information, to carry out field practices effectively and design 
questionnaire instruments correctly (for example, skip patterns and translations), they must receive adequate 
trainings: include a thorough pretest training  for senior survey staff  and then a main training  for all field 
staff. 
• As part of  data quality assurance during data collection, regular  field check tables  are produced for central 
office staff  to monitor progress and minimize non-sampling errors. 
• Software used for processing survey data  handles complex applications (such as skip patterns), 
hierarchical files (for example, linking individuals to households), and PAPI or CAPI routines, and it includes 
automatic consistency checks. 
• Final survey data sets disseminate clean and consistent data in standard recode files, with any imputed 
data clearly flagged and described in accompanying documentation. 
• Sample weights  take into account nonresponse rates and are applied separately to household and individual 
records.
• For users to properly interpret survey results and microdata, survey metadata  are available that describe 
the design, implementation, data processing, and analysis. Module 8: Population-Based Surveys   63References: Module 8

This module is one of 12 HIS data source modules in Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best

Description
The civil registration and vital statistics system has two functions, one legal and the other statistical. Two or more 
national agencies share the responsibility for these functions. To carry out the legal function, the civil registration 
system operates under a national civil registration authority. The civil registration system  is the continuous, 
permanent, compulsory, and universal recording of  vital events pertaining to the population, as provided 
through decree or regulation, in accordance with the legal requirements of  a country (UN, 2014a). The civil registrar records and archives minimally recommended information surrounding individual vital events: births, deaths, causes of  death, marriages, and divorces (UN, 2014a). The registrar can then issue a legal certificate to an individual to use for legal, administrative, and other purposes. 
The second function of  the CRVS system is to compile and process vital statistics, namely from records archived 
in the civil register. In a well-functioning civil registration system, these records constitute the timeliest and most accurate source of  vital statistics in a country. The civil registration authority can process these data or coordinate with another agency, such as the ministry of  health, national statistics office (NSO), or a national registration 
agency to process the data. 
Most countries have a legal framework in place for a national civil registration system. In most low- and middle-
income countries, however, the coverage of  birth and death registration remains under 50 percent, and vital 
statistics are not routinely tabulated (United Nations Statistical Division, 2017). Regardless of  registration coverage levels, modernizing a CRVS system to facilitate regular processing of  vital statistics has great value for countries (UN, 2014a; Inter-American Development Bank & United Nations Children’s Fund, 2015; Africa Programme for 
Accelerated Improvement of  Civil Registration and Vital Statistics, n.d.). The timely production and dissemination 
of  standard tabulations of  vital statistics can call attention to the need for strengthening this data source and improve the capacity to use and interpret the data. 
National governments in most regions of  the world have renewed commitments to strengthen CRVS systems.
15 
Since 2014, about 20 regional and international partners have come together as members of  the Global Civil 
Registration and Vital Statistics Group to coordinate global activities to support countries in their commitments 
(UN, 2014b).
Registration Coverage 
To mark progress toward higher birth and death registration coverage and to mobilize the resources needed to achieve higher coverage, the international community has agreed to work toward the goal, “Universal civil 
registration of  births, deaths, and other vital events, including reporting cause of  death, and access to legal proof  
of  registration for all individuals by 2030” (WHO, 2014. Table 11 shows the targets that relate to that goal.
15 Examples of commitments to strengthen CRVS systems include the following: the United Nations Economic and Social Commission 
for Asia and the Pacific “Make Every Life Count” Global Summit on Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (Thailand, 2014); the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa first, second, and third Conferences of African Ministers Responsible for Civil Registration (Ethiopia, 2010; South Africa, 2012; Cote d’Ivoire, 2015); the WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean Regional Strategy for the Improvement of Civil Registration and Vital Statistics Systems 2014–2019; and the Pan American Health Organization Regional Plan of Action for Strengthening Vital and Health Statistics. 66  Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best Practices for Data SourcesTable 11.

individuals) and Target 17.19 (on building statistical 
capacity) that include measures of  birth and death registration coverage by 2030 (UN Economic and 
Social Council, 2016). 
To reach these targets in their own context, some 
countries require substantial infrastructure investments to expand civil registration services. Other countries that have sufficient civil registration service points 
and few remote populations, may be able to increase 
coverage quickly by strengthening oversight and accountability of  local service centers. 
For countries that currently have low registration coverage, a number of  techniques can be used to estimate 
completeness of  coverage (UN, 2014a). A simple approach is to assess the total number of  births or deaths 
registered within a defined period and area as a percentage of  the expected number of  events (WHO, 2010b; 
WHO, 2013a). For comparisons of  coverage over time using this approach, it is important that the expected numbers of  events, which constitute the denominator, are used consistently from the same source, because expected numbers vary between sources. Ideally, the expected numbers used should be official numbers produced 
by the NSO. Otherwise, expected numbers from an international source, such as the UN Population Division or 
the U.S. Census Bureau International Data Base, can be used (UN Population Division, 2015; U.S. Census Bureau, 2015). One disadvantage of  using an international source is that the numbers represent only the expected number at the national level, and the NSO may produce the numbers at the subnational level, allowing insight into patterns of  inequalities in registration coverage. 
For countries in which registration coverage is approaching completeness, a more precise method is needed, 
namely a direct method to match records from an independent source to the civil registration records. These 
methods are presented in UN documents (UN, 2014a) as well as in older, but still relevant, sources, such as those produced by the International Institute for Vital Registration and Statistics (IIVRS) (1990).
Causes of Death 
Complete and comparable information on causes of  death is an important part of  a fully functioning CRVS system. Guidance on these data is addressed in a separate CRVS section following this one: Civil Registration and 
Vital Statistics System: Causes of  Death. Sustainable Development Goals related 
to registration coverage
SDG 16, Indicator 16.9.1: Proportion of 
children under 5 years of age whose births have been registered with a civil authority, by age 
SDG 17, Indicator 17.19.2: Proportion of 
countries that have achieved 100 percent birth 
registration and 80 percent death registrationModule 9A: Civil Registration and Vital Statistics System: Registration of Events    67Types of Indicators
Civil Registration and Vital Statistics data are used to derive a range of  fertility and mortality rates and ratios. 
If  birth and death registration coverage is largely complete, then direct approaches to deriving this information 
can be used. These indicators can be produced at subnational levels, to the extent that intercensal estimates exist 
for denominators. Useful guidance on the required data and computation of  vital registration rates and ratios is presented in the Handbook of  Vital Statistics Methods  (UN, 1955) and the Handbook on the Collection of  Fertility and 
Mortality Data  (UN, 2004). 
Because birth and death registration coverage in many countries is still incomplete, a demographer, statistician, or someone with specialized training should routinely evaluate the CRVS data and apply conventional techniques to adjust or correct the data before deriving fertility and mortality measures. These are referred to as indirect techniques of  estimation. Two authoritative sources on these techniques are the Manual X Indirect Techniques for 
Demographic Estimation (UN, 1983) and the International Union for the Scientific Study of  Population tools for 
demographic estimation (International Union for the Scientific Study of  Population, 2011). 
Fertility and mortality indicators derived from CRVS data include the following: 
• Crude birth rate
• Age-specific fertility rate
• Total fertility rate
• Birth rates by birth order
• Birth ratios by specific characteristics (e.g., sex, duration of  marriage, and parity)
• Crude death rate
• All-cause age- and sex-specific death rates
• Early childhood death rates and ratios, including neonatal, postnatal, infant, and under-five child mortality
• Fetal and perinatal death rates and ratios (e.g., by sociodemographic characteristics of  the mother)
• Death ratios by specific characteristics (e.g., sex, cause of  death, and occupation)
• Cause-specific mortality rates resulting from infectious diseases, noncommunicable diseases, and accidents 
and injuries
A well-functioning CRVS system is also an important source for efficiently monitoring about a dozen global 
development indicators defined in the 2015–2030 SDGs (Table 12). Several of  the SDG indicators correspond with former Millennium Development Goal (MDG) indicators, whose measurement period has been extended. 
Several of  the indicators, denoted in Table 12 by an asterisk, require data on cause of  death. 68  Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best Practices for Data SourcesTable 12. Global development indicators, MDG and SDG, derived from the CRVS system

Alternative Data Sources
Until existing CRVS systems are sufficiently strengthened, population-based surveys and censuses can provide 
periodic indicators of  fertility and mortality, although these sources produce less timely and less precise 
information. For example, vital statistics from surveys lack precision, especially at subnational levels, because of  
statistical uncertainty inherent in sample estimates; vital statistics from population censuses lack timeliness because they are generated only once every 10 years; and vital statistics from a routine health information system provide valuable operational data for the health sector, but they are incomplete at the population level because they include 
events in health facilities but not necessarily those occurring in the community.Module 9A: Civil Registration and Vital Statistics System: Registration of Events    69Standards 
• Standards for national CRVS systems. Since 1953, the UN Statistical Division has compiled and 
maintained the fundamental standards for generating accurate, reliable, and regular vital statistics from 
national civil registration systems. In 2014, the UN Statistical Commission adopted the third revision of  the 
Principles and Recommendations for a Vital Statistics System (first revision in 1973, second revision in 2001) (UN, 2014a). The five UN handbooks on CRVS published with the second revision remain highly relevant in their respective areas (UN, 1998a –1998e). 
• 
CRVS assessment tools. WHO and the University of  Queensland have produced two assessment tools to 
guide the country in a standards-based review of  the CRVS system (WHO, 2010a; WHO, 2010b). The first 
tool is a rapid assessment consisting of  25 questions addressing 11 areas of  the system. Assuming that the 
key informants are readily available to contribute, the rapid assessment can be conducted in a few hours using an automated spreadsheet for immediate results. The second tool is a detailed tool to review and strengthen the CRVS system, including guidance for a comprehensive review (building on the rapid assessment) and the 
development of  a road map for strengthening weak areas. 
• 
CRVS training.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides a CRVS training 
course for public health professionals. The training materials consist of  an instructor guide, participant notes, 10 chapters on selected CRVS topics with PowerPoint slide sets, optional exercises and assignments, and 
technical appendices. At least 10 training days are necessary to cover the material. All materials are available free of  charge and can be downloaded from the CDC website (CDC, 2015a). 
• Many countries will also benefit from rediscovering a series of  72 technical papers on the CDC website, published from 1979 to 1998 by the IIVRS. These papers offer an historical perspective on vital statistics systems in various countries and whose improvement methods are still relevant to current efforts (CDC, 
2015b). 
• 
Sample Vital Registration with Verbal Autopsy (SAVVY). For countries whose civil registration 
system does not provide complete coverage of  birth and death registration and cause of  death information, a probabilistic sample of  areas in which all events are properly recorded and registered has the potential to 
provide representative fertility and mortality indicators (President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, U.S. Agency for International Development, MEASURE Evaluation, & U.S. Census Bureau, n.d.) 
Best Practices 
• Establish an  interagency CRVS group  with representation from national stakeholders and development 
partners to plan and conduct a standards-based assessment of  the CRVS system and, based on the results, 
develop a detailed workplan to strengthen the system. 
• Estimate the completeness of coverage  of  registered births and deaths at least annually, at the national 
and subnational levels, to inform the interpretation and reliability of  CRVS data for decision making. 
• Align official registration forms with the UN minimal-recommended data elements.
• Undertake steps to obtain cause of  death data as part of  a long-term plan toward implementing 
International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, death certification and coding.  Interim 
measures to fill the gap in cause of  death information may be establishing a SAVVY or implementing the WHO Simplified Mortality List (see the CRVS System: Causes of  Death section). 
• Disseminate annual vital statistics according to 
standard tabulations  recommended by the UN Statistics 
Division. These may be in the form of  a national vital statistics report  or another dissemination medium. 
Note that even if  the national CRVS system lacks full registration coverage, or does not collect all required  70  Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best Practices for Data Sources
data items for the recommended tabulations, it is nevertheless important to produce the tables to the extent 
possible and document where the information falls short in quality or completeness. 
• Ensure that designated national authorities comply with international reporting  practices by (1) submitting 
official vital statistics data to the UN Statistics Division for publication in the annual Demographic Yearbook 
and the biannual Population and Vital Statistics Report (United Nations Statistics Division, n.d.a; United Nations Statistics Division, n.d.b) and (2) submitting annual cause of  death data to WHO to be publicly 
disseminated through the WHO Mortality Database (WHO, n.d.). Module 9B: Civil Registration and Vital Statistics System: Certification of Cause of Death   719Civil

Diseases, Chronic Conditions, and Fatal Injuries
Description
Vital statistics derived from civil registration constitute the only nationally representative source of  information 
on mortality by cause of  death, provided that civil registration services are universal, continuous, and permanent 
(UN, 2014b). The description, standards, and best practices for cause of  death data in the civil registration and 
vital statistics CRVS system are addressed in this section because a different national agency, namely the MOH, 
manages the collection of  these data. The MOH authorizes medical personnel to certify and record causes of  
death and sets procedures for data coding, transmission, and archiving. 
After compiling the cause of  death data, the MOH coordinates with the appropriate national agency, usually the 
civil registration authority or the national statistical office, to link individuals’ cause of  death data to the legal death 
registration record. A successful linking of  information from the legal record in the civil registration system to 
the cause of  death certificate in the MOH will allow the CRVS data source to provide the complete, minimally recommended data elements needed to compute cause of death indicators (UN, 2014b).
Types of Indicators 
• CRVS cause of  death data can be used to derive cause-specific mortality rates resulting from infectious diseases, noncommunicable diseases, and accidents and injuries, including several Sustainable Development Goal 
indicators (see, Module 9a: Civil Registration and Vital Statistics System – Registration of  Events, Table 12).
Alternative Data Sources
In the absence of  physician-certified deaths in a CRVS system or sample registration system, a country can obtain 
probable cause of  death information from verbal autopsies. In the CRVS database, these or other cause of  death 
data should be clearly distinguished from physician-certified cause of  death data because the methods are not 
strictly comparable.
Standards
1. Cause of death certification and 
coding.  The international standard 
rules and instructions for classifying and 
coding deaths are defined in the WHO 
International Statistical Classification of  Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) 
(WHO, 2010a). The current version is the 
tenth revision (ICD-10). The next revision, 
ICD-11, will be released in 2018. 
“In compiling and publishing mortality and morbidity statistics, WHO member countries agree to comply as far as possible  with 
recommendations made by the World Health International Classification of Diseases
Since 1948, the WHO ICD is the single internationally 
endorsed standard for generating comparable statistics pertaining to morbidity and cause of death trends. It provides evidence for monitoring and evaluation, epidemiological research, and provider reimbursements and resource allocation. ICD is used by more than 115 countries for diagnosing and coding causes of death. 
ICD-10 consists of three volumes: Volume 1 is a tabular list 
of the classification of diseases in three- and four-character levels; Volume 2 is an instruction manual and guidance on using ICD; and Volume 3 is an alphabetical index to diseases and nature of injury.Module 9B: Civil Registration and Vital Statistics System: Certification of Cause of Death   73Assembly as to classification, coding procedure, age-grouping, territorial areas to be identified, and other relevant 
definitions and standards.” (WHO, 1967)
2. International medical certificate of death form.  This form ensures the proper recording of  the 
immediate, antecedent, and underlying causes of  death (Figure 3). The form may be translated, but the 
standard format and wording must stay intact. It is typically embedded in the official death notification form 
where other facts surrounding the death are recorded. This form provides information for identifying the underlying cause of  death, which should be linked to the official registration record in the CRVS database. 
Figure 3. International form of medical certificate of death
Source: WHO ICD-10 Volume 2, Section 4.1.3 (WHO, 2010a)
3. ICD-10 training. WHO provides an interactive self-learning tool structured to provide a full ICD-10 training 
or training on specific modules (WHO, 2010b). It can be used for self-learning, in a classroom setting, or on the 
web, allowing for interaction with specialists. The tool also has translation capabilities. It can be used online or 
downloaded and installed on a computer. The basic training on ICD-10 coding is about two hours, the training on completing the medical certificate of  death is less than an hour, and the full training is about 40 hours. A brief  overview of  ICD-10 can be obtained through reviewing the chapter summaries (about five hours). 
  74  Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best Practices for Data SourcesIn addition, since 2010, the WHO Family of  
International Classifications Network Education 
& Implementation Committee, the international 
body responsible for ensuring standardized coding of  mortality and morbidity data in WHO member states, develops ICD implementation, curriculum, 
training, and certification materials. The Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention National Center for Health Statistics publishes these documents on its website (Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention National Center for Health Statistics & 
Education & Implementation Committee, 2016).
4. 
ICD-10 automated software.  This software 
provides for automated coding of  causes of  
death and selecting the underlying cause of  
death. It is developed and maintained by the Iris Institute, an international cooperation between six countries (Germany, France, Hungary, 
Italy, Sweden, and the United States). The 
software can be downloaded for free from the German Institute of  Medical Documentation 
and Information website (German Institute of  
Medical Documentation and Information, 2016) . 
5. 
Verbal autopsy.  For countries that 
do not have the capacity for full ICD-10 
implementation verbal autopsy tools, WHO 
and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation have developed standard questionnaire instruments and analysis applications (WHO, 2017; Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, n.d.). These verbal autopsy instruments are suitable for routine 
use in capturing information on the circumstances surrounding deaths for all age groups, including on 
circumstances related to maternal and perinatal deaths and deaths caused by injuries. The WHO recommends that results recorded in the verbal autopsy instruments are reviewed independently by two or more physicians. If  the probable cause of  death is the same for both, then this is the final cause recorded; if  the cause of  death 
is different from the two physicians, then a third physician will decide on the final cause to record. Publicly 
available software that automates cause of  death diagnoses also exists, such as open-source tariff  method, InterVA-4, and others, but although these methods have shown some success in replicating cause-specific mortality fractions in the population, they have replicated physician-assigned cause of  death at the individual 
level only about half  the time (Desai, et al., 2014). 
6. 
Simple mortality list.  WHO has developed a Startup Mortality List (SML) (ICD-10-SML) of  115 
categories of  causes based on the full ICD-10 general mortality list. Countries that do not have the resources to code causes with ICD 3- or 4-digits can start with the SML as a first step toward standardized reporting of  
causes of  death. An electronic module (DHIS 2) has been developed to collect and tabulate information on deaths (WHO, 2014a). This is especially relevant for hospital deaths.Iris software for automating cause of death 
information
The Iris software is based on the international 
death certificate form. There are two ways that Iris software can be used. First, in the “code entry” mode, an officer enters information about a death, including each of the physician-certified diagnoses and the corresponding ICD-10 code. Iris will then automatically apply the ICD-10 rules to the sequence of coded causes and use an algorithm to select the underlying cause. 
Second, in the “text entry” mode, an officer (or 
physician) enters the cause of death diagnoses in free text, and a country-specific dictionary of medical terms will automatically translate the diagnosis into an ICD-10 code. IRIS has an English dictionary of medical terms, and dictionaries with terms in other languages are being developed. After the dictionary is enhanced with local terms, text entry becomes the most efficient mode to produce consistent data. 
Most countries in Europe have used Iris for several 
years. Australia implemented it fully in 2013, and the United States is transitioning from the Mortality Medical Data System to Iris. Iris software presents an excellent opportunity for any country planning to use an automated system.Module 9B: Civil Registration and Vital Statistics System: Certification of Cause of Death   75Best Practices
Most low- and middle-income countries only generate ICD-10 physician-certified cause of  death information 
for deaths that occur in some hospital s (WHO, n.d.). Some steps toward obtaining more complete and reliable 
mortality data in the long-term are as follows: 
• Establish a permanent  ICD-10 reference body  to oversee ICD-10 implementation and quality assurance.
• Update and institutionalize the International Medical Certificate of Death  form, in paper or electronic 
format. Train physicians on how to properly complete the form following the WHO guidelines on sequencing 
of  events leading to death. The WHO quick reference guide provides instructions for properly completing 
the international medical certificate of  death form. It gives step-by-step instructions to certifiers on how to correctly complete the form, and indicates frequently used ill-defined causes of death that certifiers should 
avoid. The form can be easily translated, printed on two pages, and folded into a small booklet for easy 
dissemination (see Standard #2).
• Develop and roll out 
physician training,  refresher courses, and continued professional development on 
ICD-10 certification. Institute ICD-10 training in medical school curriculums (see Standard #3). 
• Train and engage a small number of  dedicated ICD-10 coders who are not practicing physicians, who 
all receive the same training, and who code deaths daily or at least on a regular basis. This will help ensure 
consistent coding practices between individual coders that will minimize bias and provide experience with a 
sufficient number of  deaths so that skills are continuously exercised and sharpened (see Standard #3).
• Because all hospitals have physicians on staff  and the completion of  a death certificate is a routine aspect of  medical care, ICD-10 certification and coding should be implemented for all 
deaths in hospitals, with 
the expectation of  rolling out the procedures for deaths in the community. For countries that intend to apply 
ICD-10 to deaths in hospitals but do not yet have the capacity to code those deaths in standard format of  Verbal autopsies
What are they? In low- and middle-income countries, deaths in the community are least likely to be 
certified by a physician and registered in the civil registration system. To address this discrepancy, WHO and other partners have developed standard verbal autopsy instruments. Verbal autopsy is a method that helps determine probable causes of death at the population level, where there is generally no medical certification. 
How to administer them? To obtain nationally representative results on causes of death, the verbal autopsy 
instrument can be employed as part of a Sample Vital Registration with Verbal Autopsy or included as a module in a larger population-based survey. To administer the verbal autopsy, interviewers are trained to conduct an interview with a household member and record information on signs and symptoms of a recently deceased person. The probable cause of death can be either derived manually by physicians reviewing the questionnaires and assigning a cause or derived automatically from a computer algorithm.
Caveats—Probable causes of death provided by verbal autopsies can fill a gap in mortality data, but 
this should be regarded as a temporary measure. Although the probable cause of death from the verbal autopsy is attributed an ICD-10 code, the causes of death are not physician certified per the required medical certificate of death form and according to ICD rules and instructions. Therefore, although studies suggest that verbal autopsy can provide cause of death information that at the population level is similar to physician-certified deaths in high-quality hospitals, the data from the two sources are not strictly comparable and should be distinguishable at the time of analysis. (Note that the WHO Mortality Data Base contains only physician-certified deaths.) 76  Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best Practices for Data SourcesICD-10 3 or 4 characters, WHO developed the ICD-10 SML (see Standard #6) that can be used as a first step 
toward standardized reporting of  causes of  death. 
• The underlying cause of  death is considered to be the most informative data element related to cause of  
death from a public health point of  view, and thus is used for tabulation and comparisons. It is “the disease or 
injury that initiated the train of  morbid events leading directly to death, or the circumstances of  the accident or violence that produced the inj ury” (WHO, 2010a, Section 4.1.2). To 
properly select the underlying 
cause of death,  coders are taught to apply the ICD rules and instructions to the sequence of  causes. 
Automated software developed by the Iris Institute is available to facilitate coding of  multiple causes of  death 
and selection of  the correct underlying cause (see Standards #3 and #4).
• WHO has produced two useful tools for processing ICD-10 codes.  First, the Microsoft Access-based 
CoDEdit tool improves data quality by checking the validity of  each ICD-10 death record and flagging records in which a correction needs to be made (WHO, 2014b). Second, the Microsoft Excel-based ANACoD 
application performs a comprehensive analysis of  ICD-10 data on mortality levels and causes of  death (WHO, 2013b; AbouZahr, et al., 2010).
• For communities where deaths are not certified by a physician, cause of  death information may be captured through a standard 
verbal autopsy instrument,  in which the probable cause of  death may be assigned 
either through review by trained physicians or using computer algorithms (see Standard #5) . Module 9B: Civil Registration and Vital Statistics System: Certification of Cause of Death   77References: Module 9

Public Health Threats
Description
A public health surveillance system  is an essential public health function defined by ongoing systematic collection, 
compilation, analysis, and dissemination of  data on reportable diseases and other events that present a potential 
threat to public health security (Thacker & Berkelman, 1988). The system is designed to monitor routine and 
ad hoc data within and outside the health system and to use them to assess risks to public health. If  predefined 
risk thresholds are surpassed, the system triggers rapid response activities. The response activities, including 
coordinating investigative and control measures, are carried out by officers in the Ministry of  Health and by other emergency response teams, depending on the origin of  the threat. This module focuses on surveillance activities rather than response mechanisms because they are the data source for monitoring public health threats.
A national surveillance system consists of  two main components: indicator-based surveillance (IBS) and event-
based surveillance (EBS) (WHO, 2008, 2014; European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, n.d.). 
Indicator-based surveillance represents the classic functioning of  a surveillance system designed to monitor the frequency, origin, and distribution of  reportable national and international diseases. It is passive surveillance in the sense that cases are reported through the routine health information system from disease surveillance 
sites, laboratories, central medical stores, and other routine reporting channels. The data are typically structured 
according to case definitions, and they enter the health system through a patient encounter at an outpatient 
consultation or inpatient admission, or a patient encounter with a health worker in the community. One of  the 
shortcomings of  passive surveillance is that reportable cases remain unidentified if  symptomatic persons, for whatever reason, are not captured through a routine reporting system. 
The EBS component is designed to recognize events and emerging public health threats that may not otherwise 
enter the surveillance system (WHO, 2014). This mechanism complements IBS by actively scanning the Internet, 
media, and sources of  big data, and by making ad hoc contact  with health providers and others in the community 
(such as at schools, workplaces, border control) to detect potential risks. EBS does not necessarily adhere to case definitions, and unstructured data must be analyzed to determine the presence of  a public health risk. An example 
of  EBS is monitoring the patterns of  flu and dengue data that are collected by Google Internet search engines 
(Google, 2015).
Together, the IBS and EBS surveillance components constitute “all hazards” surveillance and require an early 
warning and response (EWAR) mechanism (Figure 4). 10

In summary, the core activities of  a surveillance system are as follows (WHO, 2001, 2006a):
• Prioritization of  diseases and events in the surveillance system
• Detection of  reportable diseases according to a case definition 
• Assessment of  other potential public health threats 
• Registration of  standardized cases 
• Confirmation of  cases (clinical or laboratory confirmation)
• Notification and reporting of  confirmed, probable, or suspect cases16
• Analysis and interpretation (updating information and visualization products, including maps, to assess trends, 
patterns, and risks)
• Triggering of  response and control measures (epidemic preparedness and outbreak investigation)
• Provision of  information, education, and communication 
• Provision of  feedback to data providers
 
16 Notification is the formalized mandatory communication process through which reportable diseases or events are communicated in 
national or international surveillance systems (WHO, 2014).Module 10: Public Health Surveillance System   83Types of Indicators
The EBS system works with unstructured, ad hoc data and therefore is not associated with pre-defined indicators. 
The IBS system, however, generates indicators that correspond to each notifiable (reportable) disease or 
condition. Because each condition is recorded in a standard format, the following types of  indicators are derived 
from individual or aggregated reported cases:
• The number of  cases according to each case definition (disease-specific or syndromic)
• Survival status of  cases (clinical diagnosis of  morbidity or mortality)
• Laboratory diagnoses 
• Classification of  cases (suspected, probable, or confirmed)
Surveillance officers should monitor the number of  cases for each disease or event frequently and produce a 
sufficiently detailed epidemiological description to track its origin and distribution. Indicators should be broken 
down by selected individual characteristics (such as sex and age), geographical location, and time period. These 
dimensions, referred to as “person, place, and time,” are necessary to identify subpopulations and areas that are prone to outbreaks so they can be targeted for intensified preventive measures, such as information, education, and communication; immunization; vector control; and sanitation efforts (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2012).

Standards
The WHO publishes international health regulations to help control the international spread of  disease. The World Health Assembly adopted the first International Health Regulations (IHR) in 1969. In subsequent decades, 
increases in global travel and trade have resulted in increased risks of  disease spreading across borders, and 
the IHR were substantially revised in 2005 (WHO, 2005). In addition to defining a limited list of  predefined, notifiable diseases, the new IHR introduces a decision instrument for countries to use to determine whether an event constitutes a public health emergency and must be reported to WHO (WHO, 2005). These emergencies can 
be any unexplained illness or condition, regardless of  origin or source, which could present significant harm to 
humans. The IHR also require countries to develop and maintain core capacities for surveillance, throughout the country and at points of  entry, to prevent and respond to acute public health risks (WHO, 2010; 2013). 
International Notifications
The national IHR focal point notifies the WHO contact point of  the first new or suspected case within 24 hours and all cases thereafter that meet any of  the following criteria (WHO, 2005): 
• Four diseases must be  reported to WHO: smallpox, poliomyelitis, human influenza caused by a new subtype, 
and severe acute respiratory syndrome. 
• Other diseases with high epidemic potential (cholera, pneumonic plague, yellow fever, and viral hemorrhagic 
fever)  may be required to be reported to WHO if  they are considered an international public health concern 
according to the IHR decision instrument. 
• According to the IHR decision instrument, these diseases and events should also be reported: “Any (other)  84  Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best Practices for Data Sourcesevent or disease of  potential international public health concern, regardless of  the origin (e.g., biological, 
radiological, nuclear, chemical, contaminated food or natural disasters), including those of  unknown causes or 
sources (WHO, 2005).”
Regional and National Notifications
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO Regional Office for Africa developed technical 
guidelines for integrated disease surveillance and response (IDSR) in the African region to streamline surveillance 
activities and standardize the flow of  information among and within the levels of  the health system. Integrated 
disease surveillance and response is a strategy to strengthen surveillance, laboratory, and response capacities at each level in the health system, in line with IHR (WHO & CDC, 2010). The IDSR technical guidelines provide a wealth of  guidance, including a list of  priority diseases in the region; standard case definitions for each disease; 
model forms for reporting; and recommendations for and examples of  analyzing reported and confirmed cases by 
person, place, and time. 
National public health policy should establish a country-specific list of  notifiable diseases and conditions. 
The list should be reviewed about once every five years to determine whether changes are needed, such as (1) 
discontinuing surveillance for low-ranking diseases or events; (2) revising the surveillance and response procedures 
at each level of  the health system for notifiable diseases or events; or (3) incorporating new, high-priority diseases and health threats. Surveillance activity would typically focus on a list of  approximately 20 diseases, although each 
country determines the number, given its prevailing risks and resources. WHO provides guidance on undertaking 
this type of  regular prioritization exercise (WHO, 2006b).
Countries should also comply with IHR 2005 if  they implementing the EWAR mechanism. The WHO interim 
document on implementing EWAR, with a focus on EBS, is an excellent reference (WHO, 2014). 
Best Practices 
• Conduct an evaluation using the Joint External Evaluation Tool (WHO 2016) to assess country capacity to 
prevent, detect, and rapidly respond to public health threats.
• Formulate and implement a public health surveillance monitoring and evaluation strategy  and set of  
procedures.
• Ensure that every reportable disease has an explicit case definition  that describes the condition, the 
laboratory criteria, and the case classification.
• Employ standard reporting forms  for each reportable condition, including international standard 
reporting forms where they are available.
• Take advantage of  affordable technologies to streamline the surveillance system.
• Obtain  complete and accurate reports of  all reportable diseases and events from all public and private 
health facilities required to notify cases. 
• Periodically review the official list of priority surveillance diseases and events about once every five 
years and revise as necessary.
• In collaboration with WHO, the Ministry of  Health, and stakeholders, carry out a five-year external 
assessment of  the implementation of  the surveillance and response strengthening efforts, as well as the 
multi-disease approach. Undertake annual internal reviews.
• Apply the IHR decision instrument  to determine whether a public health event constitutes a public health 
emergency and requires notification to WHO through the IHR focal point and WHO contact person (WHO, 2005). Module 10: Public Health Surveillance System   85• In the WHO African Region, use  IDSR  as a vehicle for IHR implementation, including integrating standard 
case definitions, reporting instruments, and other regional strategies  as applicable.
• Have procedures and tools in place to monitor and assess early threats detected through event-based 
surveillance.
• Empower local leaders  to support surveillance activities, particularly to detect reportable cases and work 
with public health authorities to alert potential threats in their communities. 
• Monitor surveillance data continuously and assess them for outbreaks and public health risks, with particular 
attention to person, place, and time, which trigger responses to targeted subpopulations  most in need 
of  interventions.  86  Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best Practices for Data Sources

Interventions Targeted at the Health System
Description
Healthcare interventions generally entail a mix of  personalized services and goods that an individual consumes 
when coming into contact with the health system. These interventions require an individual’s action to acquire 
the good or service from a provider, and they can be recorded in an individual record (see, Module 1: Individual 
Records) (Rychetnik, et al., 2002; McLeroy, et al., 2003). Collective services, on the other hand, target the general 
population or the entire heath system rather than individual users. 
Collective interventions include diverse services at the community-level whose common purpose is to improve or 
maintain overall health and safety of  everyone in the target population simultaneously (OECD, Eurostat, & WHO, 2011; Institute of  Medicine, 2002; McLeroy, et al., 2003; ICHI Alpha, 2016). Community-level services promote 
or protect health, or prevent ill health, in communities or populations. They comprise programs, for example, 
that promote healthy living conditions, halt the onset of  disease, diminish the number of  cases, and/or lessen the severity of  disease (OECD, Eurostat, & WHO, 2011). Collective services also include interventions on the governance and administration of  the whole healthcare system with the aim to improve its effectiveness, efficiency 
and equity for the benefit of  all users (OECD, Eurostat, & WHO, 2011). These health system interventions relate 
to policy formulation, standards setting, information systems strengthening, monitoring and evaluation, and 
financial management. 
Community-level interventions are carried out by a wide variety of  public and private actors in the health 
sector as well as in other sectors. In the health sector, it is common in low- and middle-income countries to train community health workers to carry out a range of  activities to facilitate healthcare, conduct education and 
advocacy campaigns, and collect data (WHO, 2007).
 17 Establishing a community health worker (CHW) program, 
including the recruiting, training, and deploying of  CHWs in communities, is in itself  a community-level health intervention that governments might wish to track. In addition, CHWs carry out individual-level interventions 
on behalf  of  the health facility, such as notifying vital events in the community, visiting patients in their home to supervise various treatment regimes, and referring patients to the appropriate care provider. These individual-level interventions carried out by the CHW contribute to other data sources, including individual records and 
civil registration and vital statistics system (see, Module 1: Individual Records and Modules 9a and 9b: Civil 
Registration and Vital Statistics System). 
Objectively defined data on collective interventions are rarely readily available, yet the information is important 
for two main reasons. One, the expenditures linked to these interventions are necessary for producing for health 
accounts. Second, for research, the information provides potentially significant explanatory power when evaluating 
factors influencing health outcomes. The lack of  data in this domain can be explained in part by: (1) the definition 
of  community is ambiguous as a unit of  analysis; (2) community-level indicators are associated with outputs 
from a project, program, or public health initiative, and, therefore, information is scattered in various mid-term or end-term reports produced by the project; and (3) community-level indicators lack definition that make them SMART.
18
17 Mobile phones are an increasingly used for recording health interventions that take place in the community, outside of a health facility. 
This is called mobile health, or mHealth, and it refers to the use of mobile communication devices in health promotion, including both community-based and individual-level initiatives in the community (WHO, 2011). However, although the interventions take place in the community, such as the ones carried out by CHWs, they are likely to be individual-level interventions rather than collective interventions. 
18  SMART = specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, time boundModule 11: Collective Intervention Records   89Evaluating Community Interventions
Collective interventions are implemented at community level, and the community is the level of  analysis. 
Indicators of  collective interventions can provide important inputs into evaluation studies to ascertain the impact 
of  projects and initiatives on population health outcomes. Below are examples of  their use:
• A community-level information campaign on the benefits of  needle exchange implemented in Community A 
is associated with a significantly higher rate of  needle exchange among most at-risk populations compared to Community B, where there was not an information campaign.
• The deployment of  a larger number of  CHWs per capita in Community A is associated with significantly 
higher birth registration coverage rates in compared to Community B.
• The implementation of  a substance abuse program in Community A has a significant effect on reducing the 
number of  single vehicle nighttime crashes (Community Toolbox, 2016).
Although community-level interventions are often used as simple, categorical variables, as in the examples above, they can be used as group-level inputs in more sophisticated analyses, for example, in a multi-level analysis, to determine their effect on health outcomes (Diez-Roux, 2000). 
Types of Indicators
Indicators of  collective interventions can be expressed as the number of  targeted communities in which specified public health interventions are implemented in a certain reference period. The following are examples of  
community-level services: 
• Assessment and purification of  source water 
• Modification of  public entrances for accessibility
• Preparation for disasters 
• Anti-smoking campaigns
• Promotion of  healthy transportation behavior, e.g. wearing a helmet
• School lunch programs
• Public health surveillance and screenings 
• Fortification of  food products 
• Community mosquito control 
• Media or advocacy campaigns on healthy lifestyles
• Immunization program operations
Community-level services can target most-at-risk populations and reach out to vulnerable groups of  people. For 
example, for persons at risk of  AIDS or living with AIDS, providers can launch specially designed educational campaigns to reduce barriers for voluntary testing and treatment, implement needle exchange programs, and install syringe drop boxes in public places. 
Public health intervention indicators do not feature among internationally agreed-on indicators, but they do 
appear as part of  the inventory of  healthcare evidence in some countries. The Saskatchewan Population Health and Evaluation Research Unit, for example, has presented a range of  community health indicators as well as a 
conceptual framework for their evaluation (Jeffery, et al., 2006).  90  Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best Practices for Data SourcesAlternative Data Sources
The primary data sources and their format will vary widely, depending on the community-level indicator and the 
sector that records the indicator. 
Standards 
Two standards exist for classifying collective interventions. The International Classification for Health Accounts (ICHA), used in standard health accounts, classifies collective interventions under program code HC.6, Preventive 
& public health services and HC.7, Governance, and health system and financing administration (OECD, 
Eurostat, & WHO, 2011). 
HC.6 program codes distinguish collective interventions to benefit a population, prior to individual diagnoses 
being made, from individual curative and rehabilitative interventions. These include:
• HC.6.1 Information, education and counselling programs
• HC.6.2 Immunization programs 
• HC.6.3 Early disease detection programs
• HC.6.4 Healthy condition monitoring programs
• HC.6.5 Epidemiological surveillance and risk and disease control programs
• HC.6.6 Preparing for disaster and emergency response programs
HC.7 program codes define collective services that focus on the health system, aimed to benefit users of the 
health system, versus direct care services.  
• HC.7.1 Governance and health system administration
• HC.7.2 Administration of  health financing
In addition to the ICHA classification, the ICHI is a statistical classification used for health inter ventions, 
including public health interventions at the population level (ICHI Alpha, 2016). Although still in alpha version, 
ICHI has the potential to produce comparable data on collective public health interventions across countries. 
International Classification of  Health Interventions classifies collective interventions around three axes: target, 
action, and means. A few examples are the following: 
• The ICHI code for “Media campaign about immunizations” is VAF PM QA, indicating health-related behav-
ior, immunization (target), education (action), and media campaign (means).
• The ICHI code for “Education about alcohol use by providing instruction materials” is VAA PM QC, indicat -
ing health-related behavior (target), education (action), and instructional materials (means). 
• The ICHI code for “Capacity building interventions targeting drug use” is VAC VA ZZ, indicating illicit drug 
use (target), capacity building (action), and intervention using other method, without approach, or not other -
wise specified (means). Module 11: Collective Intervention Records   91Best Practices
• The health information unit maintains a repository  of  collective public health interventions and 
classifies these by the type of  activity, implementation date, target communities or at-risk populations, and 
responsible party.
• The health information unit reports on community-level interventions  regularly to raise awareness and 
elicit demand for and use of  these data, and to make them available for further analysis of  their effectiveness and cost-efficiency on health outcomes. 92  Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best Practices for Data Sources12References: Module 11

This module is one of 12 HIS data source modules in Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best 
Practices for Data Sources. The full series of modules (available at https://www.measureevaluation.org/resources/publications/tr-17-225) is intended to provide health authorities and other health information stakeholders with a reference guide that, along with other sources, can help align the HIS data sources with international standards and best practices. 94  Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best Practices for Data SourcesType of Data Generated: Healthcare Spending by Financing 
Source, Provider, and Healthcare Consumption
Description
Health accounts measure healthcare spending and track funds that flow through the health system, from their 
origin, to agencies that pool and distribute the money, to providers who engage in healthcare activities, and 
finally to beneficiaries of  the activities. The System of  Health Accounts (SHA) is an international framework 
that improves accountability and governance of  health resources by defining standard criteria for classifying 
expenditures and answering policy-related questions about how resources are mobilized and managed (Cogswell & 
Dereje, 2015).
Health accounts’ health expenditures encompass all activities whose primary purpose is to restore, improve, and 
maintain health for the nation and for individuals during a defined period of  time (WHO, 2000). Records of  
expenditures for these activities, or a basis for estimating them, are required regardless of  the type of  institution 
or financing entity, which includes traditional, complementary, and alternative medicine. It also includes preventive and long-term care. 
Health accounts also track the flow of  health resources by using financial data compiled from various entities 
in the health system. These funding sources include the government, development partners, employers, and 
households; insurers and other pooling mechanisms; financial agents paying for healthcare activities; and 
healthcare providers (Figure 5).

Module 12: Health Accounts    95Evolution of the Health Accounts Framework
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development developed a standardized methodology for 
health accounts based on the underlying principle of  health consumption: “what is consumed (expended) has 
been provided and financed.” The principle was developed into the ICHA and published in A System of  Health 
Accounts, Version 1.0  (OECD, 2000) . This triaxial classification system enabled OECD member countries to 
produce comparable results on healthcare consumption, healthcare provision, and healthcare functions. 
Several countries outside of  the OECD also adopted the SHA v1 as a means to compare the level and structure 
of  their healthcare spending with those of  other countries. However, given that the original framework did not 
include a way to capture the multitude of  financiers of  the health sector in developing countries separately, the World Bank, the WHO, and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) added a source of  funding classification. In 2003, they published the Guide to Producing National Health Accounts, with Special Applications for Low-
Income and Middle-Income Countries , referred to as the national health account Producer’s Guide (World Bank, WHO, 
& the United States Agency for International Development, 2003). 
Since 2007, OECD, Eurostat, and WHO, along with other development partners, updated the SHA v1, and 
incorporated the financing sources from the Producer’s Guide, to produce a single global health accounting 
standard. A System of  Health Accounts, published in 2011, is currently the international standard for comparing national spending levels and structures (OECD, Eurostat, & WHO, 2011). Although there are a few key differences between SHA v1 and SHA 2011, the triaxial approach remains the fundamental classification scheme for expenditures (Cogswell, et al., 2013). 
There are several advantages to SHA 2011, which include the following: 
• The classification system can be used in countries regardless of  their health system structure and income level. 
• The system is compatible with other national classification systems so that countries can produce results using 
the national system and/or map expenditures to the international standard. 
• The system is compatible with other standard classifications, including the International Classification of  Diseases-10 to code diagnoses, the International Standard Industrial Classification to code economic activities, 
and the System of  National Accounts, which is the standard structure for broader economic accounting 
(e.g., gross domestic product and other macroeconomic measures). 
Institutionalizing Health Accounts
In order to maximize the potential of  health accounts to track financial flows, monitor health system performance, and benchmark healthcare spending with other countries, they should be produced on a regular 
basis, ideally annually (Cogswell & Dereje, 2015). Health accounts that rely heavily on survey estimates for out-
of-pocket expenditures, for example, will be conducted less regularly because of  the time it takes to conduct the surveys and obtain the results (WHO, 2010). To ensure regular production of  the health accounts, the central 
government, such as the ministry of  health or central statistics office, should establish a health accounts team that 
ensures sufficient human capacity, the necessary hardware and software, and access to data. The cost of  sustaining regular production depends on the availability of  data from the financial information system and other sources, and the extent of  external expertise needed to process the data. Implementing a health account for the first 
time is the costliest step, but over time, as financial information systems are improved and analytical capacity is 
strengthened, both the quality and efficiency of health accounts will improve. 
Alternative Data Sources
None.  96  Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best Practices for Data SourcesTypes of Indicators
The data that are compiled and processed from the SHA 2011 are reported in a systematic way in a series of  
standard tabulations (OECD, Eurostat, & WHO, 2011, pp. 353 –369). The basic set of  tables includes cross-
classifications of  the main ICHA classifications (HCxHF, HCxHP, and HPxHF), and more detailed tables can be produced according to the country’s needs. The data in these tables are used to present and compute health expenditure indicators. 
Some key indicators are computed directly from data in the tables (e.g., expenditure levels, percentage share 
to total, ratios of  one health accounts component to another), and others are computed in combination with 
additional financial data (e.g., share of  gross domestic product, per capita values, values converted to purchasing power parity).
The WHO Global Health Expenditure database defines 20 global health expenditure indicators, all generated in 
accordance with the SHA 2011 methodology (WHO, 2014) . 
Examples of  key indicators from the basic SHA 2011 tables include the following:
• Share of  prevention in hospital services 
• Ratio of  inpatient and outpatient spending financed by government 
• Level of  capital spending in publicly owned hospitals
• Total amount of  out-of-pocket health expenditures
• Total amount paid to hospitals
• Total amount spent for prevention
• Total amount spent on pharmaceuticals (adding inpatient use of  pharmaceuticals to outpatient use) 
• Total amount spent on long-term care (adding the healthcare and the social parts)
Table 14 presents selected indicators produced from the SHA 2011 tables.Module 12: Health Accounts    97Table 13. Selected examples of indicators used in healthcare analysis

From the most recent information available on the WHO Global Health Expenditure Database website (see 
“Document Center”), 53 countries have completed the collection and classification of  health expenditure data for 
at least one year, using the SHA 2011 system. Another 34 countries are undertaking the production of  SHA 2011 
data for the first time (WHO, 2014). 
 98  Health Information System Strengthening: Standards and Best Practices for Data SourcesStandards
The SHA 2011 is the internationally recognized framework on which health accounts can be developed, or 
mapped, for national use and international comparisons (OECD, Eurostat, & WHO, 2011). 
SHA 2011 is organized around three axes defined by the ICHA: healthcare functions, healthcare provision, and 
healthcare financing. The results inform the country on the kinds of  healthcare consumed, the providers that deliver the healthcare, and the financing source that pays for the healthcare (Cogswell, et al., 2013; Cogswell & Dereje, 2015).
Tools
The Health Accounts Production Tool (HAPT) is a software application developed by USAID and WHO that supports countries undertaking a health accounts exercise. The HAPT facilitates the production of  health 
accounts by mapping national health expenditures by the SHA 2011 core and any defined country-specific 
classifications (Health Finance and Governance Project, 2014). The Health Account Analysis Tool complements the HAPT by automatically producing graphs and charts for informing the policy process. Both tools are available for download from the WHO website (WHO, 2016). 
Best Practices
Best practices are adapted from the Health Finance and Governance Project ( Cogswell, et al, 2013; Cogswell & 
Dereje 2015 ):
• The government mandates that health accounts are  institutionalized in a central government agency or a 
local university.
• The regular production of  health accounts is an item in the government’s budget.
• A health accounts  technical team is established  to plan, manage, and monitor the estimation process, 
including mapping expenditures to the SHA 2011. 
• The country’s key health expenditure indicators  are produced from standard health accounts tables.
• Health accounts are packaged in a f ormat that informs policy  and planning.
• A health accounts steering committee and other stakeholders promote the dissemination and use  of  results.Module 12: Health Accounts    99References: Module 12
