1. Introduction 
A specialized regulatory window for nonbank e-money issuers (EMIs) is one of four 
basic regulatory enablers for inclusive digital financial services in emerging markets and 
developing economies (EMDEs) (Staschen and Meagher 2018). For the purposes of this 
guide, EMI is defined as any regulated entity—bank and nonbank—that is dedicated to 
issuing e-money or similar stored-value accounts, even if it trades under a different name 
such as a limited-purpose bank or payments bank.1 
A special regulatory window for EMIs can be effective only if it is combined with 
necessary supervisory changes. The role of supervision is threefold: (i) to ensure risks 
are identified, adequately managed, and mitigated by EMIs; (ii) to enforce compliance 
with regulatory requirements; and (iii) to create procedures to manage an EMI crisis. 
Effective supervision helps supervisors identify and manage risks before they reach scale 
and provides evidence-based input for regulatory changes. The question is: How do we 
effectively supervise EMIs?
Proportionality in supervision can optimize the efficient use of limited resources and 
avoid stifling EMI innovation and growth. There is no unique recipe for a proportional 
approach to EMIs, and what is proportional in one country can be disproportional in 
another. Defining an approach requires understanding an EMI’s inherent risk profile, in 
line with what EMIs are permitted to do by regulation. Like banks, EMIs collect funds 
from customers and promise to pay them back, but EMIs do not extend credit facilities 
or engage in risky operations. In fact, EMIs are usually required to back all e-money is -
sued (the money owed to customers) with liquid funds. Because of this fundamental dif -
ference, EMIs have a lower risk profile and, therefore, require less supervisory attention 
than banks.
A proportional approach also considers whether an EMI has systemic importance 
because of its size, cross-jurisdiction activity, or other aspect.2 The level of supervisory 
1 Thus, an EMI can be a nonbank (an entity that does not intermediate deposits collected from the public) or a 
bank that is specialized in e-money issuing and not permitted to lend, such as payments banks in India, niche 
banks in Mexico, and payment service banks in Nigeria. It does not include models where customer deposits 
are held in traditional deposit accounts, even if they are accessed through agents or digital channels such as 
mobile phones (e.g., branchless banking providers in Pakistan). Unless indicated otherwise, the word “bank” 
in this publication refers to traditional banks that are allowed to intermediate and leverage customer deposits.
2 According to BCBS (2016a, p. 2): “[I]n some countries, non-bank financial institutions, while not systemic 
based on the value of funds they intermediate, may present a systemic dimension due to the number and type 
of customers they serve.”2  A Guide to Supervising E-Money Issuers 
attention will vary across EMIs as a result. For instance, a light approach that focuses on 
offsite monitoring and enforcement of fund safeguarding rules might suffice for certain, 
in particular smaller EMIs in a given country. For other (larger, systemic, or problematic) 
EMIs in the same country, a proportional approach could mean conducting inspections 
that cover all topics addressed in this paper and more. Additionally, each country’s ap -
proach depends on a range of context-specific factors such as concurrent supervisory 
priorities, available expertise and supervisory technology (SupTech),3 and the stage of 
implementation of risk-based supervision. 
This paper aims to (i) provide general guidance to EMDE supervisors who are design -
ing proportional approaches to EMI supervision and (ii) serve as a reference for drafting 
or improving EMI supervision manuals in a few specific areas. After a general introduc -
tion to the concept of proportionality and how it applies to EMI supervision, the paper 
describes supervisory procedures to be adopted during licensing, offsite monitoring (sur -
veillance), and examinations of EMIs. It relies on the authors’ own experiences, interviews 
with a sample of supervisors,4 and existing literature, including international standards 
and publicly available supervisory guidance. 
This paper focuses on protection of customer funds and addresses operational risk, 
money laundering and financing of terrorism (ML/FT) risk, and EMI business plans and 
offsite monitoring. There are certainly other areas that are relevant for EMI supervision 
that go beyond the scope of this paper. For instance, this paper does not address correc -
tive and enforcement measures, EMI resolution, fit-and-proper analyses, cross-border as -
pects of EMI supervision, and the role of interoperability, cloud computing, and APIs in 
EMI supervision. It also does not cover every important risk area, partly because some of 
these areas are addressed in other papers. (See Table 1  for definitions of the most relevant 
risks in EMIs, some of which are discussed in this paper).5 
While some supervisors may find the combination of all the procedures described in 
this paper to be excessive or complex, others may find it insufficient and lacking depth. 
Our intent is to illustrate how analyses in the areas covered could be done; it is not to 
propose an ultimate list of topics and procedures. In line with their general supervi -
sory approach, supervisors can incorporate some or all procedures in their supervision 
3 SupTech is the use of innovative technology by supervisory agencies to support supervision. See Broeders 
and Prenio (2018) and Dias (2018).
4 In-person, phone, or written interviews were done in 2017 with financial supervisory authorities respon -
sible for e-money issuers in Austria, Colombia, France, Ghana, Hong Kong, India, Luxembourg, Malaysia, 
Mexico, Myanmar, Nigeria, Peru, the Philippines, Singapore, Tanzania, Uganda, and the United Kingdom.
5 Consumer protection, data collection for supervision of EMIs, and the implications of EMIs operating 
through agents are covered in Dias (2013); Dias and Staschen (2017); and Dias, Noor, and Staschen (2015), 
respectively. 1. Introduction  3
manuals and deploy them in comprehensive or focused examinations, offsite monitoring, 
or thematic reviews.
Finally, the procedures are described in a manual, labor-intensive “version,” which 
is all that is possible in several EMDEs where SupTech is incipient. The paper high -
lights examples where SupTech could lessen the burden on the supervisor. The degree 
to which technology is leveraged will affect the effectiveness and proportionality of 
EMI supervision.
The primary audience of this paper is EMDE supervisors who oversee EMIs. Regula -
tors, policy makers, and international organizations that promote effective EMI supervi -
sion to foster healthy financial inclusion in EMDEs may also find this of interest.4
2. A proportional approach to EMI supervision
2.1 Proportionality in EMI supervision
In a proportional supervisory approach, the supervisor’s expectations should be com -
mensurate with the EMIs’ risk profile (the risks inherent to EMI activities) and their sys -
temic importance. These expectations determine the supervisory intensity to be applied 
and the consequent use of supervisory resources. Generally, EMIs require a lower level of 
scrutiny as compared to traditional banks. Across EMIs, different levels of intensity are 
warranted: large, systemic, or problematic EMIs may require supervision on all topics 
included in this paper and more, while a lighter approach (e.g., limited to offsite monitor -
ing and/or assessing fund safeguarding) may be appropriate for small EMIs that do not 
present particular problems. 
There is no single recipe for a proportional supervisory approach to EMIs. What one 
supervisor considers to be proportional may be considered disproportional by another. 
Supervisors have differing views on the use of supervisory tools (market monitoring, off -
site and onsite examinations, and thematic reviews), the scope of supervision (the topics 
covered), and the depth of supervision (the level of detail in the examinations, the tech -
niques used—analytical and audit procedures—and their frequency).
2.2 Banks and EMIs: Different scope of activities and different risk profiles
In earlier times, banks collected cash and other assets (e.g., gold) from customers 
for safekeeping ( fiduciary function ). After realizing that not all customers (depositors) 
requested all their assets at the same time, banks started to lend part of these assets to 
other customers ( intermediation function ). This was the birth of modern banking, with 
its key inherent risks (credit, maturity mismatch, liquidity, and capital). By assuming such 
risks, banks have a critical role in allocating funds in the economy. Financial intermedia -
tion and leverage create basic risks, but banks also engage in many other risky operations, 
including among themselves and across national boundaries. They also provide payment 
services. Because of their complexity and risks (which small depositors are unable to as -
sess at a reasonable cost) and their importance to the economy, banks have been heavily 
regulated for generations.
EMIs are much less complex; they do not intermediate and leverage customer funds. 
However, they have the fiduciary function in common with banks: they collect customer  2. A proportional approach to EMI supervision  5
funds and promise to pay back at a future, undetermined date.6 Like banks, EMIs need 
to manage risks to keep that promise. The fundamental difference is that while banks 
manage a complex array of intertwined risks and are leveraged (they do not have enough 
funds to pay back all depositors at once), EMIs, by regulation, are mandated to always 
have enough funds to pay back all customers in full. Fund safeguarding requirements aim 
to protect customers and allow for a lighter supervisory approach. EMIs are required to 
keep a segregated pool of liquid funds equivalent to the sum of funds collected from cus -
tomers and are prohibited from intermediating them. Additionally, regulations often cap 
e-money transactions and accounts to limit customer, operational, and money laundering 
risks.7 EMIs do not have most of the financial risks faced by banks.
Still, EMIs do have risks. Most importantly, EMIs offer payment services (withdraw -
als, transfers, and purchases) through a variety of channels, using IT systems, telecommu -
nications, business partnerships, outsourcing arrangements, widely dispersed staff and 
agents, connection to merchants, and payments infrastructures, such as switches and 
other payment systems. These elements create operational, ML/FT, and consumer risks, 
among others. Table 1  lists the most relevant risks of EMIs on an institutional level, some 
of which are covered in this paper.
6 This fiduciary function exists regardless of how a country defines e-money as opposed to bank deposits.
7 See Staschen and Meagher (2018) and CPMI (2016, pp. 26–27).Box 1. Approaches to EMI supervision 
All the supervisors interviewed for this research conduct some supervisory 
activities on EMIs, even in jurisdictions where the legislation allows exemption 
of small EMIs from licensing and supervision (e.g., France, Luxembourg, and the 
United Kingdom). All of them, at a minimum, collect periodic statistics for market 
monitoring purposes, and some (e.g., Luxembourg) include safe and soundness—
checking whether an EMI is in good financial health—as well as institution-focused 
examinations. Most supervisors interviewed have established supervisory procedures 
that cover a few risks at the institution and market levels, which vary widely in their 
scope and depth from covering only a few system-level issues, such as efficiency and 
competition through bi-annual statistics (e.g., Central Bank of Brazil), to collecting 
a wealth of frequent data and conducting periodic onsite inspections on key risks, 
including consumer protection and fund safeguarding (e.g., most of the supervisors in 
Sub-Saharan Africa), to using a risk-based methodology addressing all types of risks 
(e.g., Luxembourg’s Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier). 6  A Guide to Supervising E-Money Issuers 
Table 1. EMI risks
Risk Description
Risk of loss or 
misuse of customer 
funds (covered in 
paper)This is the risk that (i) EMI employees, agents, or third parties access and misuse customer 
funds, including for lending or investing purposes, (ii) EMIs fail to manage customer account 
balances, and (iii) customer funds are unavailable because of bankruptcy of the EMI or the 
bank holding customer funds. Although this risk may appear to be part of the other risks in 
this table, it is emphasized because it is at the center of the supervisory review.
Operational  
and IT risks  
partially  
covered  
in paper)Governance and internal controls—lack of good risk governance, board oversight, and 
an effective corporate control environment can lead to the materialization of risks.
Data and cybersecurity risk—risk that physical and digital assets, such as customer data, 
hardware, and networks, are compromised. This risk is closely related to fraud risk and 
data privacy risk.a
Settlement risk—the risk that the settlement will not take place as expected. It comprises 
counterparties’ credit and liquidity risk. Operational failures at the EMI or counterparties 
can be a source of settlement risk.
Fraud risk—internal (e.g., by employees) and external (e.g., by customers and cyber-
criminals) frauds. The number of reported fraud cases in EMIs globally continues to grow, 
particularly the number of internal frauds by EMI staff, sometimes in collusion with agents. 
Business continuity risks—weaknesses in the management, maintenance, or soundness 
of equipment, networks, connections, and physical facilities; inability to prepare for 
and act on disasters (e.g., flood, fire); and the lack of critical staff. This risk can lead to 
disruption of operations.
Agent risks—a key piece of EMI operational risk that can enhance ML/FT, consumer, 
and other risks. Not all operational risks are attributed to technology. Many arise from 
people’s behavior, such as failure to follow policies because of lack of training or en -
forcement. For EMIs there is the risk of lack of cash (often referred to as “agent liquidity”) 
at agent points and the risk of poor customer due diligence.
Third-party risks—in addition to agent risks, EMIs face risks through their business 
relationships (e.g., payment system operators, card companies, telecommunication 
companies, cloud computing providers, and entities linked through application 
programming interfaces). 
Liquidity risk (not 
covered in paper)The risk of not having enough funds for the EMI to meet its obligations (e.g., suppliers, 
outsourced parties, employees) when they are due. This is different from EMI agents not 
having cash to serve customers.
ML/FT risk  
(covered in paper)The risk that e-money accounts and transactions may be used to fund terrorist activities 
and launder proceeds of crimes. To limit this risk, e-money transactions and e-money 
customer account balances usually are capped by regulation.
Consumer risk  
(not covered in 
paper)Ineffective or no disclosure of key information, unfair contractual terms and conditions, 
product unsuitability, unfair business and sales practices, no out-of-court redress mecha -
nisms (including internal complaints handling channels). Data privacy risks, the risk of 
loss of funds, and delays in transaction completion are also concerns.
Strategic risk  
(partially covered  
in paper)bThe risk of large losses from poor strategic decisions (e.g., expansion into new markets) 
that could lead EMIs to stop operating.
Legal risk (not  
covered in paper)Situations when the rights and obligations of parties involved in a contract (e.g., liability to -
ward customers in case of transaction failure) are subject to uncertainty. It may include the 
failure to give legal protection of customer funds pooled in trust accounts and the potential 
costs of legal demands against the EMI for failing to comply with laws (e.g., labor law).

a See CGAP (2018).
b Part of strategic risk analysis is done through the analysis of business plans, which is addressed in Section 3. 2. A proportional approach to EMI supervision  7
2.3 Do EMIs pose systemic risks?
Banks may face intense scrutiny because of their systemic importance. Basic con -
siderations include the (i) relevance of bank financing to the economy, (ii) the size of a 
bank or bank group, (iii) the risk of bank runs (including by contagion from a troubled 
bank to a healthy bank), and (iv) the interlinkages among banks. For example, a bank 
can have large corporate clients that play a key role in the economy; if the bank suddenly 
stopped financing these clients, the country could suffer. Or a bank may have millions of 
customers who run to withdraw their deposits because they heard the bank is in trouble. 
This can lead to runs on other banks. Finally, because banks lend and borrow from one 
another in a dynamic web of interbank operations, the more banks depend on a certain 
bank (e.g., for intraday liquidity), the more systemic that bank is. And if that bank fails, 
other banks may fail, too.
All supervisors interviewed—including those in countries where EMIs have reached a 
significant scale—agree that EMIs in their countries pose limited or no systemic risk.
Although EMIs do not provide finance, they can provide fund storage and payment 
services to customers. EMDE supervisors need to assess whether an EMI poses systemic 
risk and understand that some EMIs can grow very large very fast. To determine the sys -
temic importance of EMIs, supervisors should ask the following questions: 
• Can an EMI become so large (i.e., number and types of customers) that the welfare 
of many people would be significantly affected if the EMI goes bust and thus can no 
longer provide a critical or highly valued service?
• Could the failure of one EMI deteriorate the public confidence in the EMI sector and, 
thus, trigger contagious effects?
• Could the failure of an EMI affect public confidence in banks or other regulated fi -
nancial institutions?
• What types of businesses (e.g., government services, private sector companies) rely 
significantly on the EMI? How would a disruption in the EMI’s operations affect these 
businesses? Are major losses expected? 
• Has an EMI become a systemically important payment system?8
• Can an EMI introduce risks to the national payment system?9
8 CPMI (2001, p. 14) provides guidance on how to identify systemically important payment systems. The 
guidance focuses on financial sector stability and does not cover consumer protection, competition, and crime 
prevention, which might be relevant to EMIs.
9 EMIs can participate in the national payment system—more specifically by directly linking to the real-time 
gross settlement system—in only a few countries (e.g., the United Kingdom).8  A Guide to Supervising E-Money Issuers 
• Can an EMI affect banks by increasing banks’ exposure to large depositors (large bal -
ances in the e-float accounts)?10
• Can an EMI affect the profitability of banks by competing for clients, limiting access 
to agent networks, etc.?
• Can an EMI be a conduit for laundering large amounts of illicit money?
2.4 Increasing efficiency of onsite visits with better offsite preparation
Proportionality requires seeking efficiencies on offsite monitoring and onsite or off -
site procedures during an examination.11 For example, frontloading offsite preparation 
work (i.e., doing ongoing high-quality offsite monitoring and, during examinations, re -
quiring and analyzing documents and data before going onsite) can optimize onsite time. 
To prepare for an onsite visit, you may need to ask the EMI for information (e.g., poli -
cies/procedures and a granular dataset) and then to follow up with specific requests (e.g., 
for a sample of transactions). 
Some EMDE supervisors send only one documentation request before the onsite visit.
Flexibility in preparing for an examination that includes onsite visits allows supervi -
sors to make several requests to EMIs and organize preliminary findings for onsite follow 
up. This increases efficiency and saves time for both the supervisor and the EMI.
In addition, SupTech could help increase efficiency and effectiveness of data analysis, 
system audits, penetration tests, and so forth. Machine learning applications, which are 
widely available, can identify patterns and correlations that could indicate, for instance, 
unauthorized changes to customer records, attempted intrusions, and suspicious transac -
tions.12 However, the quality of SupTech outputs depends on the quality of the data used, 
so supervisors may need to improve their data first.13
Data include the standardized data regularly reported by EMIs and nonstandard -
ized (unstructured) data, such as previous inspection reports, licensing applications, EMI 
management reports, thematic reviews, agent agreements, consumer contracts, etc. Su -
pervision is more effective when these types of data are used, but they are not always 
easy to gather.
10 See Kerse and Staschen (2018) for more on concentration risk.
11 “Examination” is used in this paper to refer to an assessment focused on a single EMI. An examination 
often includes both offsite and onsite procedures and can vary substantially in its scope. Different countries 
use other terms to refer to assessments at individual institutions.
12 See Dias (2018) and FSI (2018) for more examples.
13 See Dias and Staschen (2017) for more on digital financial services supervisory data and data collection 
mechanisms. 2. A proportional approach to EMI supervision  9
EMDE supervisors face challenges in using unstructured, nonstandardized data. 
They spend long hours reading documents where information is presented in 
narratives or unstructured numerical-based data, in formats like PDFs, and even in 
hard-copy, printed versions.
SupTech solutions include using analytics software to integrate a variety of data for -
mats and make them usable.14 For example, analytics software can allow users to search 
for and analyze a large array of digitized documents automatically and to cross-analyze 
structured and unstructured data from a range of sources to generate insights for super -
visory inquiry. SupTech can make it significantly easier to sort and analyze text-heavy 
documents like policies and procedures manuals.
2.5 Implementing risk-based EMI supervision
Supervisors can use a risk-based methodology to develop a proportional approach to 
EMIs. This type of methodology provides a systematized view of risks and their relative 
14 See Bauguess (2018) for more on machine-readable supervisory data (data in a format that can be used by 
analytical software).Box 2. Risk-based supervision 
In a risk-based approach, supervisory effort focuses on the greatest risks of 
regulated markets.a The approach provides formal guidance on supervisory priorities, 
how supervision is to be conducted, and how supervisory decisions are to be made. 
Risk-based methodologies are often summarized in risk matrices. A risk matrix 
presents all risks inherent to a type of business—according to the activities permitted 
by regulation for the type of institution—and the risk factors for each risk category. 
It assigns weights to risk factors and categories according to their relative importance 
to the business type. Based on actual risk assessments of individual institutions, 
supervisors indicate how well or badly an institution mitigates inherent risks through 
governance, risk management, and internal controls. This methodology culminates 
in a risk rating assigned to each institution that is comparable across institutions. 
The matrix allows for better supervisory planning and use of resources. The more 
risk areas exist in a type of regulated institution, the more useful the matrix is for 
identifying supervisory priorities and summarizing the results of examinations. 
a For further guidance on risk-based supervision, see Wright (2018).10  A Guide to Supervising E-Money Issuers 
importance within and across EMIs and can help to standardize supervisory procedures. 
It also helps supervisors to increase or reduce the intensity of supervision of different 
EMIs over time, in a structured manner, according to past assessments of EMIs. In a 
risk-based approach, supervisory procedures, such as the ones described in this paper, are 
deployed according to an initial risk assessment based on a comprehensive data analysis. 
A risk matrix is commonly used to summarize the risk profile of a regulated institution.
There is no single risk-based methodology and risk matrix model that would work 
for all EMI supervisors. Supervisors often define risks differently and choose different risk 
categories, risk factors, and respective relative weights for their risk matrices. They also 
create different risk rating and trend assessment methods. A risk matrix that is generally 
designed for banks will not fit the risk profile of EMIs and will need to be adapted.
While all supervisors interviewed report using a risk-based approach to supervise  
banks, only a few have adapted their methodology to EMIs.
2.6 Organizational arrangements for EMI supervision
Although there is no single approach on where EMI supervision should be located, e-
money is a financial service, and as such, it should be the responsibility of financial sector 
authorities (e.g., the central bank), not telecommunication authorities, even when EMIs 
are owned by mobile network operators (MNOs).15 Within a financial sector authority, 
the internal arrangement for EMI supervision may vary.
Financial sector authorities in all the countries researched assign the responsibility of 
EMI supervision to a financial supervisory authority—typically the central bank—
rather than other financial sector authorities such as the Ministry of Finance. In a few 
countries, an independent supervisory authority (e.g., a banking superintendence) 
took on this responsibility. In most of these cases, the central bank continues to be 
responsible for payments regulation and payment systems oversight (with a focus on 
infrastructure, safety, and efficiency).
In the United Kingdom, an independent regulator—the Payment Services Regulator 
(PSR)—was created in 2015. PSR regulates payment services providers and payment 
system operators, while the Financial Conduct Authority supervises payment services 
providers, including EMIs. Oversight of the national payment system for stability 
purposes and the operation of key payment systems are done by the Bank of England.
15 In at least one country, Kenya, the central bank can authorize MNOs to become an EMI, in which case the 
MNO’s e-money line of business is regulated by the central bank and is subject to supervision. However, in 
most countries, the EMI must be a separate legal entity that is dedicated to e-money issuing. 2. A proportional approach to EMI supervision  11
Different approaches are used internally at supervisory authorities as well. In most of 
the African countries studied (e.g., in Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania), the central 
bank’s payments department—which primarily focuses on payment system oversight—
has become the EMI supervisor. In most cases, oversight and supervision are separated 
from central banking operations (e.g., real-time gross settlement systems, check 
clearing, market operations). In Hong Kong and Singapore, where the EMI supervisor 
is also the central bank, EMI supervision is done by the bank supervision department. 
In countries with an independent financial supervisor separate from the central bank 
(e.g., Austria, France, Luxembourg, Mexico, the United Kingdom), this often includes 
a team specialized in payment service providers.  
 
The experience among the supervisors interviewed indicates that there is value in 
creating a specialist team for operational and IT risks that covers all types of regulated 
entities, including EMIs. Examples of this can be found in Austria, Brazil, France, 
Hong Kong, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, and Singapore. 
Some of these countries also have specialist teams for AML/CFT and market conduct, 
and some have a specialist cybersecurity team (e.g., the United Kingdom’s Financial 
Conduct Authority ).
All organizational arrangements require some degree of coordination. Interagency 
coordination is useful for both regulation (e.g., MNO regulation on access to channels 
such as USSD) and supervision (e.g., monitoring by data protection authorities, assess -
ing the impact of e-money business on the MNO’s business and vice-versa, monitoring 
mobile insurance by the insurance supervisor, etc.). Interdepartmental coordination is 
needed, for instance, between payments oversight and EMI supervision, EMI supervision 
and bank supervision (e.g., to draw on experience with bank examinations, check com -
pliance with e-float limits on a bank, and coordinate in case of EMI resolution), and EMI 
supervision and specialist teams (e.g., operational risk).12
3. Licensing EMIs: Analyzing the business plan 
In many countries, EMIs are required to have a license to operate.16 Supervisory 
authorities conduct a range of analyses on licensing applications to ensure the EMI, its 
owners, and management meet minimum criteria, such as capital and fit-and-proper re -
quirements. Some supervisors also inspect EMIs before they begin operations and do 
background checks on significant shareholders, board members, senior management, and 
other key positions in the EMI. 
This section does not cover all issues addressed during licensing. Rather, it provides 
basic guidance for analysis of EMI business plans.
A business plan (and financial projections) is required by all supervisors interviewed 
where EMIs are subject to licensing, and some (e.g., Luxembourg’s CSSF and Bank 
Indonesia) also require periodic updates of the business plan after the license is 
granted. 
Business plans can be analyzed from two perspectives: their quality as a planning tool 
and the strength of the plan itself. 
A low-quality business plan could signal poor planning skills or unwillingness to share 
information with the supervisor. A poor plan in terms of its content could signal strategic 
risk based on poor business acumen. These perspectives apply to business plans of both 
new and already established EMIs. EMIs may update their business plans periodically to 
adapt strategies and projections to changing market conditions and past performance.
When assessing the quality of a business plan, supervisors should keep the following 
in mind: 
• The plan needs to be complete and comprehensive. 
• The sum of the parts of a plan needs to be cogent, with little inconsistency. 
Although there is no standard approach to organizing and labeling sections of a busi -
ness plan, in general, a complete business plan (of any type of organization) describes the 
overall strategy, its operations, and its financial projections. Table 2  provides an exem -
plary structure of an EMI business plan.
16 The term “licensing” is used broadly to refer to any mandatory authorization process to which EMIs are 
subject before being allowed to start operating or to continue operating after a new EMI regulation is passed. 
Countries may use other terms such as “registration” and “authorization.” 3. Licensing EMIs: Analyzing the business plan  13
In a poor business plan, important components may not be addressed or they may be 
poorly developed. Even if these components are present and fully developed, there may be 
inconsistencies. For instance, an EMI may project an unrealistic growth in the number of 
customers and transactions without a supporting strategy to address competitors, with -
out an aggressive plan to grow the agent network, and with insufficient resources to cover 
marketing expenses. Other potential inconsistencies include misalignment between pro -
jected revenues and a small target market segment (e.g., only farmers in rural areas), high 
capital expenditures (e.g., furniture, IT infrastructure, risk management software) against 
a low budget, and discrepancies in the plan’s narrative and the financial projections.
Supervisors need to have knowledge about the EMI business, in general, and local 
market conditions, in particular, to assess whether the assumptions underpinning finan -
cial projections are reasonable. For instance, the EMI’s market analysis (e.g., description 
of competitors and their strategy, market size, access to infrastructure such as switch -
ing services and specialized labor) may be inaccurate, and other assumptions (e.g., GDP 
growth, cost of funding, socioeconomic and demographic indicators, size of target mar -
ket segment, customer adoption rate, growth in revenues, etc.) may be too optimistic. 
The objective is to judge the reasonability of the projections; no plans will be foolproof. Table 2. Potential structure of an EMI business plan

If financial planning and analysis expertise are available, the calculations in the fi -
nancial projections could be probed. To do this, the financial projections need to be in a 
digital format (e.g., Excel or other) that allows the formulas to be scrutinized. The next 
section outlines basic guidance for analyzing key performance indicators for licensing.
To assess the business plans of EMIs (particularly mobile money providers), supervi -
sors should consider the EMIs’ typical growth trajectory, according to patterns seen with 
mobile money that uses extensive agent networks. (Such a trajectory may not hold for 
other business models.) The following are three phases of growth:17
• Start-up—high CAPEX, OPEX growth, probable loss
• High-growth—OPEX growth, revenue growth, modest profit, investment in customer 
acquisition through sales force and marketing
• Mature—potential additional revenue sources through product diversity and partner -
ships, solid profit
17 Almazán and Vonthron (2014) note that the largest operating expenses for EMIs in the first years of 
operation are investments in the e-money platform and the creation of the agent network, which includes fee 
expenses and commercial efforts. A small profit may appear in the second or third year, while expenses with 
agent acquisition and fees continue to be high relative to the revenues.  15
4. Offsite monitoring (surveillance) of EMIs
Continuous offsite monitoring—or surveillance—is fundamental to risk-based EMI 
supervision. Continuous monitoring helps supervisors identify (and compare over time) 
variations in the risk profiles of different EMIs. It also helps them spot indications of risks 
that could preempt supervisory (including remedial/corrective) action (e.g., an inspection 
on fund safeguarding, fraud, or strategic risk). Monitoring involves analyzing the EMI 
market (e.g., market development) and individual EMIs, thus, monitoring is an integral 
part of supervisory planning, EMI examinations, and the regulatory process.
Only a few of the EMDE supervisors interviewed conduct comprehensive market 
monitoring (surveillance or oversight) on an ongoing basis, while this is a common 
practice among supervisors of developed economies.
Offsite monitoring may involve analyzing internal standardized and unstructured 
data from the supervisory authority (e.g., reports submitted by EMIs) and external data 
(e.g., government statistics and MNO data). It may use financial data (e.g., key indica -
tors) and nonfinancial data (e.g., consumer complaints, transaction volume).18 In general, 
the analyses follow a standardized methodology and uniform criteria defined by the su -
pervisory authority according to its objectives (see Table 3  for a few examples). Given the 
objectives, the depth and frequency of the analyses will depend on the data, the technol -
ogy, the supervisor’s skills, and the priorities set by the risk-based methodology.
Although assessing the financial performance of all EMIs may not be the top concern 
of supervisors, efficiently monitoring key financial indicators and other business metrics 
on an ongoing basis can help to establish supervisory priorities. 
All supervisors interviewed indicated that financial statements (balance sheet, 
income statement), prudential indicators (e.g., capital and liquidity ratios), and key 
performance indicators (e.g., ROA, ROE, CAPEX, etc.) are required to varying 
degrees and with varying frequencies.
Table  4 provides some financial and business metrics. The type and number of in -
dicators used will depend on the supervisor’s preferences and analytical skills and on 
18 See Dias and Staschen (2017) for an overview of the data collected by EMI supervisors.16  A Guide to Supervising E-Money Issuers 
the availability of SupTech and input data. Many indicators can be extracted from the 
financial statements periodically reported by EMIs, while others require additional data 
(e.g., total e-money issued; number of accounts/clients; fees paid to agents; fees from part -
nerships with third parties, such as lenders; and fees by type of product) to be collected. 
All supervisors interviewed meet with EMIs outside of specific examinations, but 
only a few have incorporated this intelligence gathering opportunity into their formal 
supervisory risk-based methodology. For instance, some supervisors organize annual 
outreach meetings or schedule meetings with individual institutions, while others meet 
EMIs on an ad-hoc basis, as needed or as requested by the EMIs.Table 3. Examples of objectives pursued with offsite monitoring and related data

parties.19 Supervisors can discuss their expectations on compliance, current con -
cerns, and broad supervisory findings when they meet with the EMIs.

5. EMI examinations (offsite and onsite procedures)
5.1 Introduction
In addition to conducting offsite monitoring on an ongoing basis, supervisors often 
conduct examinations of individual EMIs that focus on one, a few, or every risk area. 
Different approaches are used for different EMIs and across countries. For instance, a 
supervisor may conduct examinations on all EMIs at a point in time solely to check how 
EMIs implement fund-safeguarding requirements, while subsequent examinations on this 
or other issues (e.g., consumer protection) would be triggered by the findings of offsite 
monitoring. Generally, when fund safeguarding is effective, the supervisory scope and 
depth can be more limited, at least for nonsystemic EMIs. For large EMIs, supervisors 
may increase the depth of fund safeguarding analyses and expand the scope of examina -
tions by including other risk areas, such as operational risk and AML/CFT controls. 
Despite using different supervisory practices, all supervisors interviewed agreed that 
the most important area of EMI supervision is customer fund safeguarding. Other 
priorities included operational risk, AML/CFT controls, and consumer protection. Not 
all supervisors cover all of these (a few do not even check fund safeguarding), while 
others (none in EMDE) cover these and many additional areas, such as strategic risk.
This section does not provide guidance for examinations of all risk areas that supervi -
sors can cover for large or small EMIs (see Table 1 ). It is limited to describing potential 
procedures for assessing three important areas of EMI supervision: fund safeguarding 
(Section 5.2), operational risk (Section 5.3), and AML/CFT controls (Section 5.4). For 
each of these, we summarize common regulatory requirements, suggest the scope of an 
examination, and finally, illustrate offsite and onsite procedures. The procedures may be 
adopted in their totality or partially, in combination or separately, as part of full EMI 
examinations or of thematic reviews.20
20 In addition to offsite monitoring and EMI-focused examinations, thematic reviews can be useful, particularly 
in the initial years of EMI supervision. Thematic reviews give in-depth insight into specific issues, thus helping 
the supervisor compare good/bad practices and communicate its expectations to EMIs. The reviews can also help 
the regulatory authority improve regulations. Thematic reviews focus on one or a limited number of topics (e.g., 
fund safeguarding) but cover several EMIs. They may comprise offsite and onsite procedures like those described 
in this section. Among the supervisors interviewed, only a few conduct thematic reviews on the EMI industry. 5. EMI examinations (offsite and onsite procedures)  19
Many examinations include a review of policies and procedures manuals. The fol -
lowing is a three-step approach on how to do this: (i) analyze the manuals and policies 
offsite, (ii) gather evidence about their implementation (offsite and onsite), and (iii) probe 
the information through observation, interviews, and system audits (onsite).
5.2 Fund safeguarding
5.2.1 Key regulatory requirements
Most EMI regulations include fund safeguarding requirements that have two elements: 
• Segregation. EMIs are required to set aside a minimum amount of money to back the 
e-money issued or e-money liabilities ( e-float) . Typically, they must back 100 percent 
of the e-float, by depositing the equivalent amount into an account ( float account ) 
separate from the EMI accounts used for running daily operations (e.g., paying bills, 
paying/receiving fees, etc.). There may be one or several float accounts.21
 ○Liquidity requirement . Regulations require that the e-float be invested (if any in -
vestment is permitted) only in liquid and low-risk assets, such as government bonds, 
or simply in an account with a commercial bank (that may or may not pay interest).
 ○Diversification requirement.  Some regulations require EMIs to spread the e-float 
into different banks, to protect against the risk of bank failure.22
21 This section considers the most common approach EMIs use to safeguard float: depositing it into an account 
at a commercial bank and/or holding it in safe investments. Other approaches, which could affect the legal, 
operational, and supervisory issues discussed in this paper, are described in Mehmet and Staschen (2018).
22 From a bank supervision perspective, this requirement limits the risk of large depositors at individual 
banks. See Kerse and Staschen (2018).Box 3. Review policies and procedures manuals—a key examination technique 
The risk management practices and operations of EMIs are expected to be 
described in written policies and procedures manuals endorsed by the EMI’s board and 
enforced across the EMI by senior management, with board oversight. This type of 
documentation is commonly reviewed by supervisors to (a) assess their completeness, 
reasonability, and alignment with regulations and international standards and 
(b) to partially guide the supervisor’s follow-up inquiries during offsite and onsite 
examinations. Supervisors may request and analyze policies and procedures manuals 
for all areas covered in this section. An EMI that lacks or does not update policies and 
procedures manuals should raise supervisory concerns. 20  A Guide to Supervising E-Money Issuers 
• Ring-fencing. Ring-fencing arrangements protect the e-float against EMI creditors 
(e.g., lenders, investors, suppliers, employees, government). This can be done by re -
quiring the float account to be a special type of account, such as a trust or escrow 
account.23
 ○Unencumbered e-float.  Regulations may prohibit EMIs from encumbering the e-
float (e.g., pledging them as guarantee for loans) and/or may state that the funds in 
the float account are not assets of the EMI.24
Effectively safeguarding funds by EMIs does not depend only on whether the e-float is 
safe, but also on whether individual customer claims can be clearly identified and the in -
formation in the claim has not been altered. Thus, safeguarding funds is affected by how 
operational risks (e.g., the risk of fraud, errors and mistakes, business continuity, IT, and 
cybersecurity) are managed. Some operational issues in fund safeguarding are addressed 
in this section, while others are addressed in Section 5.3. Also, supervisors should assess 
whether the use of several float accounts in several banks makes fund safeguarding less 
effective. Finally, safeguarding focuses on ensuring liquidity to meet customer claims in 
two scenarios: (i) over the course of the EMI’s life (covered in this section) and (ii) in the 
event the EMI goes under.
5.2.2 Scope of examinations
Checking the float account balance is the most basic way to verify that the EMI is 
complying with the fund-safeguarding requirement. However, supervisors will need to 
use additional examination procedures if they want to assess the quality of the policies, 
procedures, and systems behind the balances reported by EMIs (e.g., to validate the ac -
curacy of such numbers and to assess the EMI’s risk management and internal controls 
that affect fund safeguarding). A comprehensive examination on fund safeguarding could 
cover the following:25
• Existence and sufficiency of funds in the float account
• Terms and legal status of the float account
• Procedures to ensure the required balance (i.e., reconciliation)
• Float account governance and management
• Liquidity of the float (i.e., investment types and no pledges) 
• Accurate control and reporting of e-float and client balances
23 See Staschen and Meagher (2018) and Greenacre and Buckley (2014).
24 Depending on the country’s law for trust or escrow accounts, pledges on the float are invalid.
25 Several EMDE supervisors interviewed check only that there are sufficient funds in the float account. 5. EMI examinations (offsite and onsite procedures)  21
5.2.3 Examination procedures
5.2.3.1  EXISTENCE AND SUFFICIENCY OF FUNDS IN THE FLOAT ACCOUNT
Supervisors can compare reports on the e-float with reports on the float account bal -
ance. To confirm the veracity of these reports, supervisors can analyze bank statements of 
the float account to do the following:
• Check the float account identification data (e.g., number, branch, account holder) 
against the float account agreement/contract and the periodic reports sent.
• Check the balance of the float account at several cut-off dates and compare with total 
reported e-float on the same dates to test consistency.26
• If interest and investment profits are paid in the float account and used by the EMI 
(including to distribute to customers), check whether the total balance reported ex -
cludes these amounts because there may be a separate claim over them in addition to 
the claim on the e-float.27
• Check whether credits and debits are concentrated around the reporting dates, 
which could raise suspicion of weak reconciliation or intentional mismatching and 
its cover up.
These procedures assume that the reported e-float is accurate. Supervisors can test the 
accuracy of the reported e-float by following the procedures in 5.2.3.6 . 
5.2.3.2  THE TERMS AND LEGAL STATUS OF THE FLOAT ACCOUNT
Float accounts are usually opened at banks. If a trust, escrow, or some other special 
type of account is required, the supervisor can review its formality (e.g., if it follows legal 
requirements for trust/escrow accounts) and its terms and conditions (which may vary 
according to the bank holding the float account). This is done by analyzing the trust or 
escrow (or similar) account agreement between the EMI/trustee and the bank to check 
whether it complies with any specific requirements, such as those in the country’s trust 
laws or other applicable law. In the case of trusts, some countries require a trustee (which, 
in some countries, can be the bank holding the trust account) to be created to manage the 
funds on behalf of the e-money customers, while other countries allow the float account 
to be managed by the EMI, and the agreements will vary accordingly.
26 Mismatches could mean ineffective controls, intentional mismatch, or even fraud. 
27 If the profits from investments and interest are not distributed or used otherwise, then there is no obvious 
reason for not counting them toward compliance with the minimum required balance unless this is prohibited 
in regulation.22  A Guide to Supervising E-Money Issuers 
The trust agreement may contain information about whether and how the account 
can be accessed and how funds can be withdrawn from it, including to be invested in 
other assets, etc. The agreement might detail the trustee’s powers and responsibilities, 
compared tothe EMI’s responsibilities, and the role of the supervisor, including the super -
visor’s prerogative, if allowed by law, to inspect the trustee. Similar restrictions on the use 
of funds and how they can be accessed may exist in the case of escrow accounts.28
5.2.3.3  EFFECTIVE RECONCILIATION PROCEDURES
Understanding how the EMI reconciles the float account with the e-float is key to 
probing the effectiveness of fund safeguarding. The EMI must ensure there is always suf -
ficient balance in the float account, and many regulations require reconciliation by the 
end of each business day.
Among the EMDE supervisors interviewed, there was limited knowledge about 
how EMIs reconcile the float account with the e-float. There is wide variation in 
reconciliation procedures across EMIs, from highly manual (e.g., an EMI staff calls 
the bank at the end of each day to increase/reduce the balance in the float account) to 
entirely automated (e.g., the float account is adjusted automatically once [i.e., batch] or 
several times [i.e., real time] through integrated EMI and the bank systems).
The first step is to study the relevant policies and procedures, which should describe 
the reconciliation process and assign staff responsibilities. Lack of formal policies and pro -
cedures could lead to insufficient fund safeguarding. Also, it is useful to understand how e-
money is created (i.e., situations that increase the e-float) and destroyed (e.g., situations that 
decrease the e-float). E-money creation/destruction can vary across EMIs. For instance, in 
EMIs working with intermediaries that buy large quantities of e-money (often called super/
master agents or distributors) for distribution (sale) to individual agents (which in turn sell 
e-money to retail customers), the e-float may be affected only when such intermediaries buy 
e-money, but not when agents and customers make transactions (buy/sell e-money). 
It is also important to know whether reconciliation is done once or several times a 
day or if transfers are done immediately when e-money is created/destroyed (real time) or 
otherwise. For instance, some EMIs permit certain intermediaries, agents, and merchants 
to pay for e-money by transferring funds directly into the float account. In other cases, 
there is a single daily reconciliation immediately before the bank’s closing time to reflect 
the net creation/destruction of e-money throughout the day. Finally, transfers to/from 
28 Some supervisors interviewed in Africa check the terms of interest payment and fees imposed by the bank, 
in part because banks have created obstacles to EMIs by offering poor terms or refusing service. 5. EMI examinations (offsite and onsite procedures)  23
the float account can be automated or manually initiated. Supervisors need to identify 
whether different types of reconciliation are used in the same EMI and assess their risk.
From a supervisory standpoint, effective automated reconciliation (whether real time 
or in batch[es]) is expected to reduce errors and delays. If data security and integrity 
controls exist, they should reduce the risk of fraud and unauthorized access to the float 
account. Even in the case of automated procedures, it is worth reviewing how the system 
is set up, by (i) asking about the rules encoded in it to trigger the transfers between the 
EMI bank account(s)29 and the float account and (ii) identifying steps that require manual 
intervention to assess their risk. Also, supervisors need to assess how reconciliation hap -
pens when a trustee is involved in the management of the float account.30
With detailed knowledge of the whole process, supervisors can assess the risk of defi -
ciency in the float account from failure of internal control or tampering by employees at 
the EMI, bank, or trustee. In the case of automated reconciliation, supervisors may con -
duct system tests simulating variations in the e-float, unauthorized access to and altera -
tion of the e-float information, and purchases or sales by agents and master/super agents. 
Other potential techniques include observing a full reconciliation process (when manual) 
and reviewing audit trails of reconciliations (when automated). If the review in Section 
5.2.3.1  reveals mismatches, the supervisor can look at the records of the reconciliation on 
the mismatch dates and ask for an explanation.31
If an EMI uses several banks to hold portions of the float, supervisors can ask how 
the EMI divides the e-float (e.g., whether it will depend on the banks where the master/
super agents have accounts). The EMI should be able to ensure that the reconciliation is 
similarly effective for all banks. Supervisors should identify whether there are differences 
in reconciliation across banks and assess their effectiveness.32
5.2.3.4  FLOAT ACCOUNT GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT
Float account governance and management play an important role in the reconcilia -
tion and the safety of the funds. EMIs must have written policies and operational proce -
29 These are the bank account(s) used by the EMI to run its business, including to receive fees and deposits from 
consumers and to pay expenses such as salaries. The funds to be deposited in the float account will come out of 
these accounts (unless buyers of e-money can pay for e-money by depositing directly into the float account).
30 Depending on the arrangement, the examination procedures may need to be performed at the trustee. 
31 Supervisors may investigate mismatches further by checking if there is any internal management or audit 
report about the mismatches and whether and how mismatches are regularly reported to the board, risk com -
mittee, or audit committee, if any. 
32 Depending on the regulation, EMIs may be required to spread the e-float across several banks according to 
certain criteria (e.g., maximum portion of the total e-money issued per bank). In such a case, the supervisor 
may add procedures to check compliance with the specific requirements and criteria.24  A Guide to Supervising E-Money Issuers 
dures that govern access to and operation of the float account. In most cases, only a few 
designated employees are authorized to access and make transactions in the float account. 
In addition, the EMI needs to have a contingency plan that ensures reconciliation contin -
ues as expected when the principal operator is unavailable. 
The access and escalation rules must be commensurate with the EMI’s structure, 
size, and complexity (e.g., in large EMIs, lower-level staff may have access to the float 
account) and the type of reconciliation mechanism (e.g., fully automated versus manual). 
Rules should be documented, and they should define the transactions permitted for each 
user profile. Supervisors can analyze the list of employees and their relevant user profiles 
to decide who they should interview to learn more about adherence to EMI policies and 
the instances in which the policies were broken. Similar controls should be in place if a 
trustee operates the float account. 
In addition to access rules and user profiles, there should be formal rules for manag -
ing the funds (e.g., transferring to/from the float account). This is related to reconciliation, 
but it also includes other situations, such as responsibilities and procedures for periodi -
cally checking interest or other income flowing into the float account and their with -
drawal or distribution and dealing with errors, such as transfers resulting from glitches in 
IT codes. Supervisors can test EMI policies through system audits.
5.2.3.5  LIQUIDITY OF THE E-FLOAT 
Supervisors also can conduct checks to ensure EMI compliance with liquidity require -
ments (i.e., permitted investments of the e-float). Most country regulations are strict. 
They either prohibit investment (e.g., require funds to be in demand deposits) or allow in -
vestments only in assets prescribed/authorized by the supervisor. Others allow (and some 
may require) a percentage of the e-float to be invested in low-risk government bonds. 
Only a few (e.g., the Central Bank of West African States) allow risky investments such 
as securities.33
Supervisors can start by asking about the investment policy/strategy (e.g., risk pro -
file, target return, assets), any recent changes (and their reasons) to the policy, and how 
decisions are made. Generally, the board should approve the investment strategy and 
the risk management functions, and the risk committee, if any, should monitor the re -
sults. Supervisors may also ask whether the investment strategy varies across float ac -
counts and request and analyze evidence of the investments made (e.g., statements of 
investment accounts, statements of the float account showing transfers to investment 
33 See Kerse and Staschen (2018). 5. EMI examinations (offsite and onsite procedures)  25
accounts), assess their performance and level of risk, and confirm the information with 
investment managers. 
Another area of interest is the regulatory prohibition of pledging the e-float as a 
guarantee for loans or other type of encumbrance. Supervisors can interview senior man -
agement and ask them about areas of concern that came up in separate interviews with 
staff responsible for EMI borrowings. For additional clarify, supervisors may analyze the 
EMI’s borrowings (loan contracts).34
5.2.3.6  ACCURATE CONTROL AND REPORTING OF E-FLOAT AND CLIENT BALANCES
Keeping accurate control of customers’ account balances is one of the most basic 
obligations of an EMI. The EMI should report to the supervisor the correct e-float (sum 
of all customer account balances), which is central for supervision. To assess this, supervi -
sors can do the following:
• Assess if there is accurate control of client balances:35
 ○Review complaints data to check for complaints about insufficient or incorrect 
balances.
 ○Review the EMI’s dormant account activity and management practices.
 ○Review the EMI’s practices for settling offline transactions.36
 ○Check the rules that allow access to the e-money platform and whether there are 
profiles that are authorized to alter client balances and under which situations. Probe 
rules by conducting system tests (e.g., unauthorized alteration of client balances).
 ○If weak controls are a concern, conduct transaction simulations to check whether 
the system correctly updates a client account balance for each type of transaction 
offered.
 ○Ask about the rules around the amounts kept temporarily in settlement or suspense 
accounts and how they affect client balances on the sending and receiving end.37
34 In countries where the trust (or other) law recognizes customers’ ownership of the float account balance, 
encumbrance of such nature is usually legally null (i.e., the EMI lender would not have a claim even if the 
float is pledged in the loan contract between the EMI and the lender).
35 The controls should be the same for any type of client, including agents.
36 Most EMI regulations in EMDEs require e-money transactions to be conducted in real time (i.e., immedi -
ately affecting customer account balances), but there are exceptions. When offline transactions are permitted, 
customer account balances will be outdated temporarily before the transaction is finally settled. These and 
other issues in operational risk (e.g., data security, disaster recovery) are important to enable continuous ac -
cess to updated client balance information. 
37 These accounts are designed to hold funds temporarily, while transactions or unclassified and disputed 
funds (e.g., when a customer sends money to the wrong mobile number and reports it to the EMI before the 
transaction is settled) are being settled.26  A Guide to Supervising E-Money Issuers 
• Assess if there is accurate reporting of the e-float:
 ○Compare previously reported e-float on several cut-off dates with reports generated 
upon the supervisor’s request and in the presence of the supervisor (onsite) directly 
from the EMI e-money platform (account system).
 ○Ask how periodic regulatory reports on the e-float are produced, who the responsible 
staff are, and whether manual procedures are used to generate the report. Ask staff 
responsible for the reports about weaknesses (e.g., whether the EMI system is not able 
to automatically report the total e-money issued or any other field in the regulatory 
report). If concerns arise, require staff to simulate the production of a report in front of 
supervisors and ask about the steps taken when errors have been found in the reports.
 ○Ask whether pending transactions (i.e., amounts temporarily registered in suspense 
or settlement accounts) are included in the total e-money issued reported to the 
supervisor and are considered for replenishing the float account. Probe rules by 
conducting system tests.
5.3 Operational risk
5.3.1 Key regulatory requirements
Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from (i) failed internal pro -
cesses, people, and systems or (ii) external events (BCBS 2011, p. 3). EMI regulations may 
contain general requirements for EMIs to manage their operational risk, including risks 
related to agents, frauds, cyber-threats, IT systems, and business continuity. These regula -
tions typically require a minimum risk governance and management structure, such as 
board oversight and an internal auditor, and senior management responsibilities, includ -
ing establishing written policies and procedures, internal controls and risk management, 
and compliance functions. In some countries, a separate outsourcing regulation may ap -
ply to EMIs and impose rules such as for data storage (e.g., outsourced cloud computing) 
and the supervisor’s access to the outsourced parties (BCBS 2016a, p. 28 [EC 8]). There 
also may be regulation on data security and business continuity.
5.3.2 Scope of examinations
Operational risk is complex and involves interdependencies with other areas, such as 
fund safeguarding, AML/CFT, and consumer protection. A comprehensive operational 
risk examination can be burdensome and may not be justifiable for all EMIs. Supervisors 
need to determine to what extent and how often, according to their risk-based approach, 
each EMI will be covered for operational risk and adjust this coverage over time. 5. EMI examinations (offsite and onsite procedures)  27
This section does not address all aspects of operational risk nor does it provide a struc -
ture for a comprehensive assessment. Rather, it gives high-level guidance for the following:38 
• Risk governance
• Overarching operational risk management framework
• Fraud prevention and management
• Data security (including cyber-security)
• Business continuity and disaster recovery
While most procedures can be conducted by generalists, other procedures may re -
quire specialized inspections (e.g., to assess the robustness of the IT infrastructure, test 
cyber-security defenses, etc.). Supervisors who do not have in-house expertise may hire 
external auditors, when permitted by law (BCBS 2016a, p. 14 [EC 11]). In addition, 
SupTech tools can help supervisors partly overcome capacity constraints, for instance, to 
analyze large transaction datasets.
5.3.3 Examination procedures
5.3.3.1  RISK GOVERNANCE
Every EMI must have a formal framework for managing operational risk, including 
IT risk. A risk management framework needs to be customized to the EMI business. And 
there must be clear lines of governance and responsibilities—enshrined in formal agree -
ments—between an EMI and its parent company.39
Many EMIs in our research are owned by MNOs and “use” the risk management 
framework (and key infrastructure) of their parent company, even though an MNOs’ 
risk management focuses on the risks of the telecommunication business, not on the 
e-money business.
Like banks, large EMIs should formalize three lines of defense: (i) business line or 
management controls, (ii) risk management and compliance functions, and (iii) indepen -
dent internal and external auditors. Small EMIs can apply the same concept to a less 
formal structure, but the internal auditor must always be independent from business 
38 See Annex 4 for more guidance. Important issues related to reliability of payment services, including finality 
of payments and completion of transactions in the event of loss of communication or other problem, are not 
specifically addressed in this paper.
39 It is good practice for EMIs to hire risk management staff that have experience in financial services. In at 
least one country in our research, MNOs can be authorized as EMIs (instead of being required to create a 
subsidiary). This can expose the EMI to MNO risks and vice-versa, delay the adoption of good risk manage -
ment practices, and pose constraints to supervisory examinations.28  A Guide to Supervising E-Money Issuers 
units, risk management, and compliance, and it must report directly to the board. Most 
EMI regulations require EMIs of all sizes to hire external auditors. Risk committees at the 
board level should be required for large EMIs (alternatively, risk oversight could be done 
by an audit committee), while the board of small EMIs should have at least one member 
familiar with risk management. 
5.3.3.2  OVERARCHING OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
Supervisors can assess the existence, quality, and implementation of a framework for 
operational risk. The framework should identify all sources of operational risk, such as 
IT failures, frauds, data security breaches, service disruptions, theft, and others. It should 
be approved by the board and be commensurate with the EMI’s size and complexity. In 
general, a good framework does the following:
• Defines the risk governance structure.
• Outlines a repeating cycle of risk management activities (i.e., routine processes and 
systems used to identify, measure, monitor, report, and mitigate risks).
• Covers three dimensions: (i) avoiding risks, (ii) dealing with risk materialization, and 
(iii) avoiding recurrence by improving the risk management and controls processes.
• Establishes procedures and systems to estimate and monitor losses.
• Sets the EMI’s risk appetite and countermeasures when higher risk is tolerated (e.g., 
capital buffer, insurance).40
• Establishes an independent internal audit function that reports directly to the board. 
• Provides frameworks for hiring, monitoring, and exiting from third-party agreements, 
such as outsourcing and partnerships, and for initial and periodic due diligence of 
third parties.
• Is subject to regular reviews.
The examination starts with the offsite analysis of relevant documentation, which 
includes policies and procedures manuals, risk reports, internal and external auditor’s 
reports, and reports of incidents (e.g., frauds, disruptions).41 Onsite verification, which 
can include observation, interviews and system tests, are based on offsite analyses. The 
core of onsite work is to probe whether the risk management framework is effectively 
implemented and to follow up on findings from the offsite preparation. For instance, the 
40 This is important for EMIs in a fast growth phase because the quality of operational controls and risk man -
agement may drop during this time.
41 The supervisor should try to assess the internal auditor’s independence. If the auditor’s independence is com -
promised, the reports will have little value. The external auditor’s reports can also provide relevant information. 5. EMI examinations (offsite and onsite procedures)  29
supervisor may look into whether internal controls are embedded in the EMI’s day-to-day 
activities and whether the IT systems provide a good tool for identifying, monitoring, and 
reporting risk, including data on estimated and incurred losses (e.g., reversals to custom -
ers because of unauthorized transactions, payment of insurance deductibles when claim -
ing coverage, loss of equipment because of a power outage, etc.).42
Supervisors may review how the operational risk reports they receive are generated 
and whether the data in these reports match the information in the EMI’s risk manage -
ment IT system (i.e., whether it is accurate and complete). If discrepancies are found, 
the supervisor can require internal operational risk management reports instead of the 
standard report template.
5.3.3.3  FRAUD PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT
Several different fraud types can affect EMIs.43 The EMI needs to catalog these and 
include them in the operational risk management framework and in its fraud detection 
software. Informal, incomplete, or lax fraud management at EMIs (e.g., no investigation 
of fraud cases) should raise supervisory concerns.
The risk of fraud such as unauthorized access to customer funds by EMI staff is a 
major concern among EMDE authorities interviewed. Internal fraud is particularly 
worthy of attention—most of the fraud cases in newspaper headlines in the EMDEs 
studied were perpetrated by staff, sometimes in collusion with agents.
Supervisors can do the following:44
• Check (offsite) that there are adequate policies and procedures to avoid, identify, and 
respond to frauds; that fraud typologies are identified; and that responsibilities are 
clear.
• Assess how effectively the EMI internally communicates its policy for identifying and 
penalizing internal and agent fraudsters.
• Review the history of fraud cases (offsite) over a long timeframe to identify the types 
of frauds, growth of fraud rates, areas affected, and losses incurred. This review will 
have to assess adherence to the EMI’s policies, the effectiveness of fraud risk manage -
ment, and the impact of the losses on the EMI’s financial health. Compare results with 
that of other EMIs.
42 Although targeted at complex, large banks, BCBS’s (2013) “Principles for Effective Risk Data Aggregation 
and Risk Reporting” provides guidance that could be customized for less complex institutions such as EMIs.
43 See fraud typologies in Buku and Mazer (2017).
44 Given the high incidence of frauds in some types of e-money transactions (e.g., mobile money in Sub-Saha -
ran Africa), supervisors may want to do a thematic review of fraud prevention and management.30  A Guide to Supervising E-Money Issuers 
• Equire why frauds happened and what was done to avoid recurrence. Pay special at -
tention to re-occurrences.
• If analytical capacity or software are available, request and audit (offsite) granular 
datasets to probe the information provided by the EMI with respect to frauds, such 
as to identify unusual patterns in transaction behavior (e.g., concentration of large 
withdrawals in a short time frame and geographic location).45
• Probe information provided by the EMI on its history of red flags from the fraud de -
tection system and about the parameters used to issue flags.
• Check access rights to the e-money account system and enquire which staff can delete 
and alter data, transfer funds, etc. Ask about the controls to limit access to the platform 
and protect customers’ login details and about exceptions to the rules. Use enquiries and 
system tests to assess whether staff are able to manually create/destruct e-money.
• Analyze audit trails to, for instance, search for unusual or attempted unauthorized 
logs by staff and agents (e.g., nighttime activity by staff) and simulate unauthorized 
actions.
• Ask about the frequency of updates to the fraud detection system and patch manage -
ment (acquiring, testing, installing, and keeping track of code changes).
• Assess how settlement accounts (temporary or suspense accounts) are managed. Poor 
reconciliation can be an opening for fraudsters.46
5.3.3.4  DATA SECURITY (INCLUDING CYBER-SECURITY)
Data security is important for risk management in EMIs given their reliance on digital 
data, widely spread agent networks, and increasing connectivity with third parties. EMIs 
of any size need effective data security strategies formalized in a data security program . A 
good data security program does the following:47
• Is approved by and is the responsibility of the EMI board.
• Appoints an executive (e.g., information security officer) to be responsible.
• Is based on risk assessment(s) conducted by the EMI or external experts.
45 Despite the potential benefits of conducting audits of large sets of granular data to assess how an EMI man -
ages and reports its operational risk, including the risk of fraud, most EMDE supervisors interviewed did not 
have the expertise and analytical software required.
46 An example of this is a high-profile fraud case in mobile money in Uganda related to the unauthorized 
transfer of funds to/from these accounts. See Morawczynski (2015).
47 Data security and data privacy are related, but they are different areas of supervisory review. This section 
does not address data privacy (e.g., whether the EMI seeks customer consent before sharing data for market -
ing purposes). 5. EMI examinations (offsite and onsite procedures)  31
• Identifies and classifies data according to their sensitivity.
• Covers all facilities and systems used to access, collect, store, use, transfer, secure, and 
dispose of data.
• Classifies risks to data security into internal and external, and identifies their sources, 
likelihood, and impact.
• Covers administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure security, confidenti -
ality, and integrity of data to (i) avoid risk ( prevention ), (ii) identify risk ( detection ), and 
(iii) respond to risk materialization ( treatment ). See Box 4 for examples of safeguards.
• Frames the ongoing and periodic evaluation of the program’s effectiveness and conse -
quent improvement.
Depending on the EMI and the expertise available, an examination can mix docu -
ment review, interviews, observation, and system tests. It may do the following:48
• Gather evidence that the security program is protecting the EMI against risks and will 
continue to do so given the EMI’s business and growth strategy.
• Analyze and further enquire about the results of risk assessments.
• Analyze auditors’ reports and implementation of their recommendations.
• Analyze data security in outsourcing agreements, including cloud computing, transac -
tion processing, API development, and others.49
• Analyze risk data (e.g., reported data security breaches, hacks, virus injections, etc.).
• Assess the physical security of sensitive facilities (e.g., data storage/processing).
• Test key controls, including by doing a vulnerability scan, penetration tests, audit trail 
analysis, etc.
An EMI’s security program is only as strong as its weakest link. For instance, many 
EMIs in Africa and Asia use Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), which is 
considered a low-security channel for carrying customer data. Also, EMIs often rely on 
personal identification numbers (PINs) to authenticate customers, but many customers 
disclose their PINs to EMI agents. Although many countries use USSD and agents to fa -
cilitate financial inclusion, supervisors should assess how EMIs reduce the related data se -
48 See Annex 4 for additional resources.
49 All EMDE supervisors interviewed were concerned about the outsourcing of cloud computing by EMIs, 
particularly across borders, because this could make accessing data and data storage facilities for supervisory 
purposes difficult. For example, India has recently issued a directive that requires payment system providers 
to store all data related to their operations exclusively in India, thus effectively prohibiting them from using 
cross-border cloud computing (see Baur-Yazbeck [2018]).32  A Guide to Supervising E-Money Issuers 
curity risks (e.g., through biometric authentication, one-time password tokens, anomaly 
detection, or gradual shift away from USSD).
5.3.3.5  BUSINESS CONTINUITY
Business continuity management is important for operational risk management and 
should be well developed in large EMIs.50 Business continuity arrangements should en -
able the EMI to rapidly resume critical operations and restore key IT infrastructure in 
the event of both minor and severe disruptions (e.g., disruption in telecommunications, 
power outages, natural disasters). Business continuity management enables companies to 
respond to and reduce the impact of crises. 
50 See Annex 4 for more guidance.Box 4. Examples of EMI data security measures
As part of its data security program, an EMI may do the following: 
• Implement a dual control system and segregate duties.
• Do background checks of and provide specialized training to critical staff.
• Immediately revoke access rights of departing employees.
• Maintain an inventory of technology resources (e.g., physical devices, network 
connections).
• Do periodic system updates and manage code changes (patch management).
• Use up-to-date monitoring tools to detect frauds and intrusions.
• Have a cyber-security program that provides a framework for risk identifica -
tion, protections, detection, response and recovery, testing, and reporting. The 
security measure should include (i) encryption of data in transit and in storage 
(CGAP 2018), (ii) firewalls and virus controls, and (iii) vulnerability scans and 
penetration tests.
• Participate in information sharing groups and take measures for continuous 
learning.
• Control access to systems and critical facilities, do resilience testing on manual 
controls, and have physical security.
• Have measures to protect against and react to destruction, loss, or damage of 
data from hazards such as fire and floods.
• Have a framework for data security in outsourcing and partner arrangements. 5. EMI examinations (offsite and onsite procedures)  33
Supervisors should assess the EMI’s business continuity plan to ensure the following:
• The plan identifies crisis scenarios and analyzes their potential impact.51
• There are contingency and recovery strategies that identify critical facilities, people, 
processes, IT systems, data, and alternative data-processing capabilities.
• Staff are adequately trained (including through simulations) to execute the plan.
• The plan is periodically tested and reviewed (supervisors can analyze the tests results).
• The EMI’s critical systems undergo stress tests.
• Policies, manual and automated controls, and risk-sharing arrangements with third 
parties are in place and ensure transactions are eventually finalized, even if communi -
cation is disrupted before completion or in case of third-party failure (e.g., payment 
initiation services).52 
The EMDEs in the study reported that failures of telecommunications and 
electricity infrastructure, which led to operational disruptions in EMI services, were 
common. These types of third-party dependencies generate risk. There seems to be 
little investment in contingency arrangements and little supervisory pressure for 
improvement. Other reported disruptions are due to unexpected or even planned 
interruptions of the EMI’s systems. The African countries researched had cases of 
major disruptions because of upgrades in the e-money platform. One case was the 
approximately 12-hour disruption of M-PESA in Kenya because of a system upgrade 
in 2017 (Capital Business 2017).
The supervisor may coordinate with the telco regulator to access data or analytics 
that could provide a broader picture of telco service disruptions. These could be com -
pared with EMI disruptions to determine how to improve contingency arrangements. 
Many EMIs in EMDEs depend on a single MNO and usually do not seek redundancy 
with other MNOs, which further exposes them to operational disruptions.
As part of the offsite examination, the supervisor can analyze data on frequency, loca -
tion, and duration of disruptions; failed or incomplete transactions; and system downtime 
and their reasons (and remedies) and follow up on previous commitments of improvement. 
Supervisors with expertise may request and audit granular transaction datasets and system 
logs to identify unusual patterns that could mean failure in contingency arrangements and 
to spot disruptions that were not reported to the supervisor.
51 Conducting a comprehensive business impact analysis and risk assessment to base the design of contingency 
strategy is good practice.
52 Many payment system laws and regulations have relevant requirements covering these situations, but there 
is limited enforcement within EMDEs in this research, which leaves customers vulnerable.34  A Guide to Supervising E-Money Issuers 
5.4 AML/CFT
5.4.1 Key regulatory requirements
EMIs are often covered by AML/CFT laws and, therefore, are responsible for send -
ing suspicious transaction reports to the financial intelligence unit and putting in place 
systems and controls to reduce the risk of ML/FT. EMI regulations focus on imposing 
balance and transaction limits to client and agent e-money accounts, such as limits to 
monthly balances, individual transaction value or volume of total monthly transactions, 
and at times, restrictions on the number of accounts each customer can have. If EMIs 
comply with these regulations, ML/FT risk could be reduced considerably. In addition, 
regulation requires EMIs to conduct customer due diligence (CDD) by verifying the iden -
tity of their customers and agents (including collection and storage of account opening 
information transaction data), and to monitor transactions to identify deviations from 
expected behavior according to customer and agent profiles.
Most EMDE supervisors interviewed for this research do not conduct specialized 
supervisory procedures (offsite or onsite) to assess how well EMIs manage ML/
FT risks. A few, however, have established specialist teams dedicated to AML/CFT 
assessments. Industry practice suggests that ML/FT transaction monitoring and CDD 
are not always adequate. In Africa, for example, there are instances of customers 
self-registering for several e-money accounts with the same EMI and across EMIs 
and evading transaction limits, thus exposing flaws in risk management systems and 
controls.
5.4.2 Scope of examinations
Transaction and balance limits work only if account-opening procedures comply 
with the rules and if transaction monitoring is effective. Otherwise, clients can have 
several accounts, collude with agents and other clients, and evade the limits for criminal 
purposes. Controls must be embedded (encoded) in the EMI’s systems, and effective 
monitoring requires specialized software. An AML/CFT examination should cover at 
least the following:
1. Compliance with regulatory limits
2. Account opening procedures (customer and agent)
3. Product, customer, and agent profiling
4. Transaction monitoring 5. EMI examinations (offsite and onsite procedures)  35
5.4.3 Examination procedures
As in other areas, supervisors can analyze (offsite) the EMI’s written policies and 
procedures manuals describing the EMI’s internal controls, risk management policy, staff 
responsibilities and IT systems related to AML/CFT.53 At a minimum, the policies and 
procedures manuals should be aligned with the applicable regulation; however, it is better 
to provide much greater detail. The examination can focus on:
• Whether the written rules are observed in practice and whether there is significant 
room for breaching them.
• How effective communication is throughout the organization regarding AML/CFT 
obligations and controls and changes to them.
• Whether there are reasonable ML typologies incorporated into the risk management 
program.
• How the detection, confirmation, and reporting of suspicious transaction is done, and 
how the EMI acts on them.
• Whether (and why) a lot of suspicious transactions have been detected by the system 
or operational level staff/agent but have not been reported to the financial intelli -
gence unit.
• Offsite analysis of internal and external audit reports and follow up onsite.
As with operational risk, supervisors can conduct automated or manual analyses of 
granular transaction data and reported events, such as account opening records, to iden -
tify suspicious situations and exceptions to the regulations and EMI policies. These data 
may be accessed onsite or collected before onsite procedures.54
5.4.3.1 COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATORY LIMITS
Supervisors can do the following:
• Analyze (offsite) related policies and procedures to comply with limits, assess their 
level of implementation (offsite and onsite), and evaluate the exceptions.
• Assess the effectiveness of the automated controls embedded in the systems to identify 
and treat and report suspicious transactions.
53 However, several EMIs in the EMDEs researched do not have specialized AML/CFT units, staff, and 
software. Rather, they use the AML/CFT program of their parent company. Given the differences between 
e-money and MNO services, AML/CFT controls need to be fully customized to EMIs. 
54 A few of the EMDE supervisors interviewed have access to highly granular EMI transaction data but do not 
conduct sophisticated analyses (such as by using modern analytical software) to identify operational and ML/
FT risks.36  A Guide to Supervising E-Money Issuers 
• Run system tests to simulate prohibited transactions.
• Ask about and require demonstration of automated controls and the criteria for alerts 
or flags.
• Analyze the log of limit breaches or attempted breaches, and enquire what caused 
these and what was done to solve them.
• Analyze granular datasets across time to probe the information provided by the EMI 
and check consistency of compliance with the regulatory limits.
• Check whether there is any control that attempts to identify clients with multiple ac -
counts within an EMI and across different EMIs. 
• Make further enquiries into the types of accounts that raise concern (e.g., self-regis -
tered accounts, accounts that have been repeatedly flagged).
• Request information on the employees who have permission to alter the limits or other 
system rules and ask whether alterations have been made in the past and how they are 
proposed and approved.
5.4.3.2 ACCOUNT OPENING PROCEDURES 
To check whether account opening procedures comply with EMI policies and regula -
tion, supervisors can do the following:
• Ask operational staff and agents about account opening (including remote) procedures 
(e.g., describe each step and rule), whether exceptions exist, whether they find it dif -
ficult to follow the procedures (e.g., examining IDs), and whether customers have been 
able to open several accounts.
• If granular transaction data are available, check whether there is a concentration of ac -
count opening volumes in certain periods/geographies or branches/agents and request 
and analyze documentation of a sample of accounts if there are any suspicions.
• Observe agents and/or staff opening accounts of actual customers.
• Conduct mystery shopping.55
• Assess risk management when using biometrics or other e-KYC/CDD procedures.
• Review procedures to identify and monitor politically exposed persons and the use of 
sanctions lists.
• Ask about and seek proof of repeated agent training covering all agent staff who con -
duct e-money transactions, through documentation and by interviewing agents.
55 For guidance on mystery shopping, see Mazer et al. (2015). 5. EMI examinations (offsite and onsite procedures)  37
5.4.3.3 PRODUCT, CUSTOMER, AND AGENT PROFILING
Supervisors may check and assess how EMIs define customer and agent profiles (e.g., 
retail customer, small agents, large agents, master agents, etc.), location (e.g., large urban 
center, border area, rural village, etc.), and other characteristics (e.g., income, date of ac -
count creation) whose combination may lead to different levels of ML/FT risk and respec -
tive expected transaction patterns. In most EMDEs researched, the regulation imposes 
account and transaction limits on all EMI customers and products, but EMIs may have 
lower limits for riskier customers (e.g., customers living in border areas) or products (e.g., 
remittances). Agents may have greater flexibility for limits because they require bigger 
transactions to serve end customers. It is important to understand how EMIs define client 
and agent profiles, because it is the foundation for identifying potentially risky behavior 
through transaction monitoring.
5.4.3.4 TRANSACTION MONITORING
EMIs may use specialized software to monitor transactions and compare suspicious 
behavior against expected behavior. While the sophistication of such systems should be 
commensurate with an EMI’s size and complexity, all EMIs should have a fully auto -
mated system. The system should be able to identify attempts to transact above permit -
ted limits, transactions not in line with the preset profiles, and other suspicious situ -
ations, such as high volume of transactions to/from few accounts, transaction surges, 
geographic concentration, multiple transactions by same customer, etc. 
Fraud and AML/CFT risk identification systems are becoming more sophisticated 
and innovative. Some use complex machine-learning analysis of numerous factors and 
data in real time to identify suspicious behavior, which could, for instance, identify 
potential multiplicity of accounts being used by the same person using fake identifica -
tion information or using relatives and friends. Such systems may automatically block 
certain accounts and trigger alerts to staff.
The quality of transaction monitoring depends on the quality and variety of the data 
used for the analytical software. An expensive and sophisticated system that uses machine 
learning will be as weak as any other system if the data are bad. The supervisor may ask 
about the data sources used and their quality to assess how well the monitoring system 
identifies and how quickly it reports risk, staff performance in reporting and treating situ -
ations flagged by the system, and whether confirmed risky situations have been reported 
to the supervisor.38  A Guide to Supervising E-Money Issuers 
Some EMDE supervisors want to collect highly granular transaction data to monitor 
ML/FT risk in real time, akin to what some of today’s financial institutions do when 
using sophisticated monitoring systems. Although this is possible, the cost-benefit 
of doing so is not clear in all cases. Supervisors can collect granular data during an 
examination and conduct the desired analyses. Moreover, real-time monitoring by 
supervisors should never be a substitute for the EMI’s obligation to do its own real-
time monitoring. FSI (2018) and Dias (2018) describe a few examples of using highly 
granular data and sophisticated analytical software for AML/CFT monitoring by 
supervisors.  39
6. Conclusion
E-money issuers play a key role in advancing financial inclusion in many EMDEs. 
And supervisors are responsible for keeping e-money markets safe, through proportional 
supervision that balances priorities and focuses on the most significant risks. While a risk-
based approach is a stepping stone for effective EMI supervision, SupTech can be used to 
alleviate the burden of labor-intensive supervisory tasks and improve in-depth analyses.
EMI supervision is simpler than bank supervision, because EMIs have, by regulation, 
a much more limited scope of activities. Hence, they usually pose limited risks compared 
to banks. In addition, typical EMI regulations impose fund-safeguarding requirements to 
back all funds owed to EMI customers with safe and liquid assets. If fund safeguarding 
is effectively implemented by EMIs, the risks of clients losing their money are curtailed 
significantly. Therefore, fund safeguarding is a central concern of EMI supervision.
There is no single recipe for the scope and depth of EMI supervision that would fit all 
countries. Supervisors need a risk-based approach that fits their context and focuses their 
assessments on the most important EMIs and their most important risks. In large EMIs, 
most supervisors will want to cover an array of risks, including operational risk, ML/FT 
risk, and consumer protection risk, in greater depth than they would in small EMIs. A 
good risk-based methodology depends on good data, starting with ongoing market moni -
toring that allows comparisons across EMIs and prepares supervisors for examinations of 
individual EMIs. The guidance given in this paper, particularly the detailed examination 
procedures, should be used wisely according to the specific risk-based approach to EMIs 
taken by each supervisor. Not all procedures will be applicable to all EMIs, and some 
EMIs may need more than what is described in this paper. Moreover, this paper does not 
cover important aspects such as corrective powers/measures and resolution of EMIs. 
Finally, while there is no single model for where EMI supervision should be located 
within a financial supervisory authority, EMI supervisors must have experience with fi -
nancial sector assessments and specific knowledge of EMI businesses. 40
