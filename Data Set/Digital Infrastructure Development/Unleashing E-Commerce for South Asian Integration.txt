E-commerce helps integrate regions across the world and can be a powerful 
force for economic development. It can help make the international trading sys-tem more inclusive, for example, by allowing micro, small, and medium enter -
prises to access new markets and by letting consumers break through geographic barriers to reduce search and transaction costs. 
In South Asia, e-commerce can play a much bigger role than it has thus far. 
While it has grown substantially in recent years, e-commerce in the region is still very small: even in India, online sales as a percentage of total retail sales were only 1.6 percent, versus over 15 percent for China and around 14 percent globally. Given that only a small share of firms has access to broadband connections and even fewer transact online, there is enormous room for e-commerce to grow in the region. For example, one forecast (Statista) shows that India, at a projected annual compound growth rate of almost 18 percent, will have the fastest growth of any country in retail e-commerce over 2019–23. Increasing use of e-commerce by consumers and firms in South Asia could potentially help increase competi-tion and firm productivity, and encourage diversification of production and exports. 
E-commerce and broader issues related to the digital economy can also lend 
themselves to controversy, such as that surrounding the enormous market power of large digital firms, or data localization. This report does not explore such topics. 
Instead, it focuses on understanding key constraints to e-commerce in a 
region that is far behind other regions, including neighboring East Asia, with the aim of unleashing the positive power of e-commerce. Using a regional approach, the report addresses the regulatory complexities of e-commerce, and it explores issues such as data privacy, consumer protection, delivery, cybersecurity, market access regulations, and digital payments. 
The report finds that ramping up e-commerce in the region would require 
significant coordination and cooperation between countries and between differ -
ent government agencies and regulatory bodies. Knowing that the development of such coordination will be a slow-moving process, the report puts forward some interesting and innovative, yet practical, ideas that would help expand vi | U NLEASHING  E-C OMMERCE  FOR  SOUTH  ASIAN  INTEGRATION
e-trade in South Asia. I can also sense the relevance of this approach to other 
regions in the world, particularly Africa and parts of Latin America and Eastern Europe.
I am confident that these ideas can help create a platform for a vigorous 
 policy debate on a vital topic.

regionally, nationally, and 
 globally
. The Internet seamlessly connects buyers and 
sellers otherwise separated by geographical distances and logistical barriers and makes transactions convenient, fast, and 
 efficient. In 2017
, a total of US$2.3 
trillion was spent globally by retail consumers, almost 25 percent more than in 2016. This figure is expected to grow to more than US$4 trillion by 2020, reach-ing more than 15 percent of total retail spending, from around 10 percent in 2015.
1 
E-commerce facilitates international trade by reducing the cost of distance and 
 r
emoteness. For example, the presence of a digital platform could substantially 
reduce the costs of connecting buyers and suppliers with  mark
ets. A few empir -
ical papers have also formally established the link between Internet and digital commerce, on the one side, and consumer welfare and other measures of eco -
nomic benefits, on the 
 other
. These studies suggest that e-commerce and online 
business activity stimulate nonnegligible consumer gains,2 entrepreneurship,3 
job growth,4 international trade,5 gross domestic product (GDP), revenues, and 
 
productivity.6 As such, its development potential may be realized along several 
channels, including enhanced participation in international value chains, increased market access and reach, and improved internal and market efficiency, as well as lower transaction 
 cos
ts.7 
E-commerce can potentially be more inclusive of underrepresented groups 
such as women, small businesses, and rural 
 e
ntrepreneurs. The benefits of 
e-commerce are well reflected in the case of China, where, for instance, Alibaba alone is reported to have created 30 million job opportunities, most notably among young people, rural communities, and disadvantaged groups (Wei 2017). E-commerce can enable small companies to transcend geographic boundaries and gain higher international visibility; or provide opportunities for more flexi-ble employment to otherwise marginalized socioeconomic groups, such as women; or otherwise benefit those living in remote areas, countering the forces of agglomeration effects (Goldfarb and Tucker 2017).
South Asia lags the rest of the world in activating the potential benefits from 
 e
-commerce. There is a large disparity in the extent of online purchases across 
the 
 w
orld. In 2015, online sales as a percentage of total retail sales were more Introduction2 | U NLEASHING  E-C OMMERCE  FOR  SOUTH  ASIAN  INTEGRATION
than 15 percent in China and in the United Kingdom, and more than 11 percent 
in the Republic of Korea, but were 1.6 percent in India (data from eMarketer) and around 0.7 percent in Bangladesh (Bansal 2017).
There are also wide variations within South 
 Asia. Of those firms in South
 
Asia that are connected to the Internet, about 50 percent of them market and sell online, and fewer than 40 percent purchase online (figure 
 I.1
). Moreover, 
intraregional variation in information and communications technology (ICT) uptake is 
 subs
tantial. Figure 
 I.1 illus
trates that while Indians and Pakistanis 
make significant use of online connectivity, other countries, such as Bangladesh and Nepal, fare worse than many African countries along most e-commerce 
 
indicators.
Recent evidence from a World Bank report (Kathuria 2018) points to the low 
levels of intraregional trade on the 
 sub
continent. Although intraregional trade 
accounts for 50 percent of regional total trade in East Asia and Pacific and 
22  per
cent in Sub-Saharan Africa, in South Asia, the figure amounts to only 
5  per
cent. Evidence indicates that current trade in goods within South Asia is 
one-third of its potential, and trade among Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan in particular has been estimated to be well below its 
 potential. This shortfall s
tems 
from high tariffs and para-tariffs, disproportionately high trade costs due to poor logistical infrastructure and inefficient trade facilitation, the existence of complicated and nontransparent nontariff measures, constraints on services trade, below-potential foreign direct investment (FDI), and the lack of regional value 
 chains
. In addition, the pervasive lack of mutual trust between countries 
in the region hurts 
 tr
ade. Such barriers negate the benefit of geographical and 
cultural  
proximity.

An e-commerce survey reaffirmed the lack of intraregional trade in South 
 Asia. As part of this s
tudy, a survey of more than 2,200 firms showed that most of 
their cross-border e-commerce was conducted with extraregional partners, 
such as China, the United Kingdom, and the United 
 S
tates. 
Given the potential of e-commerce to connect distant markets, it is possible 
that e-commerce can also strengthen commercial linkages within South Asia and bring gains to consumers and small 
 pla
yers. Through Internet communica-
tion, e-commerce has the potential to stimulate regional trade by bridging the gap between buyers and sellers on different sides of national 
 bor
ders. Evidence 
indicates that the Internet increases trade in physical goods (Borga and Koncz-Bruner 2011; Freund and Weinhold 2004; Olarreaga and Sidley Austin 2012) and digital services (Alaveras and Martens 2015; Blum and Goldfarb 2006; Lendle et 
 al. 201
6). According to the e-commerce survey previously cited, if the top 
three hurdles to e-commerce in the region were resolved, there would be signif -
icant gains in exports and 
 emplo
yment. Although the gains would be similar 
across firms of all sizes, they would tend to be higher in countries with a larger share of online sellers (see chapter 2 for more 
 details). A
part from firms, con-
sumers in South Asia stand to gain significantly from the potential reduction in costs and availability of a greater variety of e-traded goods and 
 services
. 
This report presents a conceptual framework for understanding the regula-
tory constraints on e-commerce through the private sector’s 
 perspectiv
e. Using 
this framework, the report seeks specifically to illuminate (a) the role that e-commerce can play in reducing transaction costs, (b) the regulations that com-plement or hinder e-commerce in reducing these costs, and (c) how firms engaged in the e-commerce space adjust to suboptimal modes of 
 oper
ation. 
Using this framework and consultations with private sector participants in India (Delhi and Bangalore), Nepal (Kathmandu), and Sri Lanka (Colombo), the report proposes to disentangle the complex mechanisms that prevent cross-border e-commerce from thriving in the region, as identified by key private sector 
 
players.8 In addition to these consultations, the report also analyzes the results 
of the E-Commerce Development Survey, which was designed by the World Bank and Nextrade 
 Gr
oup. Finally, the report uses this framework to propose an 
initial set of ideas that could increase e-commerce within South 
 Asia.
Despite the incipient natur
e of e-commerce in most countries in the region, 
there is growing evidence of the possibilities for cross-border 
 e
-commerce. For 
example, there is some degree of informal e-trade across the land borders, and there are other high-demand goods and services that could easily be mediated by 
 e
-commerce. Moreover, with 28 percent of the region’s population younger than 
age 15, the millions of young people who can become consumers, entrepreneurs, and technicians can expand South Asia’s e-commerce potential 
 significantly
. 
The report suggests a practical approach toward developing cross-border 
e-commerce in South Asia, building on formal and informal cross-border 
 tr
ade. 
The suggestions focus on the simplification of tariff, payment, and logistical bar -
riers to e-commerce, which were found to be the most immediate constraints on e-commerce firms operating across 
 bor
ders. To begin, consumers would ride on 
the reputation of big e-commerce firms as a substitute for formal, robust con-tractual and consumer protection mechanisms.
The report is organized as follows: Chapter 1 begins by describing 
e-commerce and then presents a conceptual framework for how e-commerce can reduce transaction 
 cos
ts. It also presents the modes of operation for firms 
engaging in digital 
 space
. Chapter 2 summarizes the results of the E-Commerce 4 | U NLEASHING  E-C OMMERCE  FOR  SOUTH  ASIAN  INTEGRATION
Development  S urvey. Chapter 3 presents an overview of the state of regula-
tions prevailing in South Asia and the specific enabling reforms that are needed 
at the national and international levels for e-commerce to flourish in the 
 r
egion. Chapter 4 proposes concrete policy implications for the construction 
of a unified digital South Asian 
 mark
et. Chapter 5 provides a menu of policy 
 options
. Chapter 6 concludes and offers practical options to kick-start the 
 formal e
-commerce market in South 
 Asia.
The r
eport mostly focuses on business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce and 
cross-border 
 issues
. Hence, it does not deal with other interesting categories of 
e-commerce, such as business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-government (B2
 G). The r
eport is not a substitute for country-specific e-commerce studies, 
although country policies do need to be referenced in different chapters of the report because regional e-trade builds on the framework set by national e-
 commer
ce 
 policies
. And although many of the recommendations would apply 
to goods and services, specific constraints on e-trade in services are not a focus area of the 
 r
eport.
Future areas of analysis on e-commerce in South Asia should include services 
and informal 
 t
rade. The possibilities for regional e-trade in services are high, 
such as in health, education, and professional 
 services
. Such trade can be inter -
mediated via e-commerce and hence made more efficient, such as in improved search for doctors and delivery of first-stage doctor consultation services via the 
 Internet. E
-commerce can also help catalyze improvements in the regulatory 
environment for specific services, as is suggested in this report in the case of e-transport in South 
 Asia. Another ar
ea for future analysis could involve more 
in-depth coverage of informal e-trade, including field studies of those who are involved in such 
 tr
ade. 
This report is part of a larger work program on building a more positive nar -
rative on regional integration in South 
 Asia. I
t is a follow-up to the recent flag -
ship report, A Glass Half Full: The Promise of Regional Trade in South Asia (Kathuria 2018), produced as part of that 
 pr
ogram. By focusing on knowledge 
generation, convening and capacity building, and communications, the program seeks to help gradually shape a more positive 
 narr
ative. Other elements of a 
broader work program on regional integration in South Asia include connectiv -
ity, water, and climate change, with details available on the World Bank website, 
 
https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/south-asia-regional-integration.

sing a rich dataset on prices, quantities, and characteristics of three consumer electronics 
products in several European countries in 2008–09, a study finds that consumers capture on average 83 percent of the total welfare gains induced by e-commerce (relative to 
 firms).
 
These benefits arise largely from increased product differentiation (Duch-Brown, Grzybowski, and Verboven 2015). As for firms, online activity also raises their labor 
 pr
oductivity. For example, an analysis of e-sales of firms in 14 European Union countries 
suggests that an increase in electronic sales raises the rate of labor productivity by 0.3 
 p
ercentage point over a two-year window in the sample period 2002–10 (Falk and

WHAT IS E-COMMERCE?
E-commerce can be defined as doing business over the Internet, selling goods 
and services that can be transacted online and then delivered offline or digitized 
and delivered online, such as computer software (Coppel 2000). The most com-mon transactions on digital markets can be broadly classified into online travel (for example, airline tickets and other transport and hotel booking) and 
 nontr
avel. 
Nontravel, in turn, features online retail (e-tailing), utilities, and other services. The e-tailing segment spans a broad commodity range, from food, to vehicles, to lifestyle products (see table 1.1 for a global picture), but certain products tend to be more “digitally tradable” than others. In India, for example, the most highly traded products fall under the categories of mobile phones, electronic and com-puter accessories, clothing, footwear, fashion accessories, and consumer dura-bles (IAMAI and Kantar IMRB 2016). As for cross-border e-tail transactions, eBay reports that in India the most highly traded products on its platform are jewelry, health and beauty products, clothing and accessories, and home furnish-ings. For example, in India, a fast-selling product such as jewelry is exported every 5 seconds, while toys or a musical instrument are exported only every 12–15 minutes (FICCI CMSME 2017).
How does e-commerce reduce transaction costs?
The benefits of e-commerce are realized through a reduction in transaction costs. With the advent of the digital economy, it is easier to find and compare information about products and services from different providers, which drives down search costs (Goldfarb and Tucker 2017). The use of standardized, auto -
matic online processes and secure payment gateways, in turn, reduces contract -
ing and payment costs. Finally, e-commerce has strongly redefined the concept of distance and remoteness, eventually decreasing transport and delivery costs for consumers. The introduction of e-commerce into an industry can be associ-ated with a decline in equilibrium of average price levels and dispersion, together with a shift in market share toward more productive firms (Goldmanis et al. 2010). Another indicator of lower transaction costs is the facilitation of matching Understanding E-Commerce8 | U NLEASHING  E-C OMMERCE  FOR  SOUTH  ASIAN  INTEGRATION

through online trade, which serves as an intermediary between buyers and 
 sellers (J
ullien 2012; Nocke, Peitz, and Stahl 2007) and increases the efficiency 
of trade itself, as it enables providers to cater to a large number of customers, 
leveraging the interoperability of Internet services (Hagiu 2012). 
Furthermore, e-commerce may provide innovative ways to address policy-  
induced tr
ansaction costs. For example, it may enhance cross-border sales if its 
diffusion facilitates the setting up of an appropriate tariff program for low-value imports, de facto circumventing the market distortions induced by taxation and duties. At the same time, the development of e-commerce might result in a more efficient achievement of various regulatory objectives and, consequently, reduce the costs of complying with the regulation itself. For instance, customer Understanding E-Commerce | 9
feedback mechanisms and the fear of reputational damage generally push 
e-commerce firms to establish various forms of self-regulation in the field of consumer protection, which are usually significantly more consumer-friendly than the national law itself. The first two columns in figure 1.1 summarize this conceptual framework, distinguishing between policy and nonpolicy transac -
tion costs and highlighting the direct or indirect effect of e-commerce on each. The last column in the figure identifies the main barriers that can hinder the diffusion of e-commerce, affecting its potential as a source of inclusive growth.
Structural gaps in the socioeconomic and business environments explain 
much of the lag in e-commerce adoption by developing countries. The lack of basic infrastructure, such as all-season roads or efficient transportation and logistics infrastructure, poses significant constraints on internal trade in poorer countries. Poor quality of basic information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure and low computer penetration further inhibit the diffusion of e-commerce. In addition, low levels of digital literacy and awareness are a cause for concern in developing countries. Most micro and small enterprises in low- and middle-income countries lack information on the possibilities afforded by digital technologies—and even if this were not the case, the workforce is usu-ally not educated in basic ICT skills or more sophisticated organizational skills, such as order handling, quality control, and processing of online payments.
Alongside such logistical constraints, there are regulatory and institutional 
barriers to e-commerce. As listed in figure 1.1, restrictive policies or the lack of enabling reforms in the areas of data privacy, consumer protection, cyber -
security, e-transactions, and e-signatures, together with competition rules that do not account for the specificities of the digital economy, can be as 
 detrimental to e
-commerce diffusion as the structural gaps. Empirical research

has established that regulatory and legal e-commerce barriers are key in 
explaining the slow diffusion of e-commerce in many parts of the world.1 
Moreover, an improved regulatory framework can be designed relatively 
 e
asily in the short run, whereas infrastructural upgrade is likely to require 
costly investment and takes a longer time to complete. This report focuses on the regulatory barriers to e-commerce that can be easily rectified, for South Asian countries to start building a conducive framework for 
 e
-commerce in a 
reasonably short time frame, exploiting the existing logistical infrastructure. Regulatory and legal barriers are among the main obstacles that slow the pace of e-commerce diffusion in the developing world (Kshetri 2007). The E-Commerce Development Survey, conducted as part of this project, shows that regulatory constraints on e-commerce and digital payments particularly hurt small firms.
2 Evidence from a phone survey of high-ranking managers 
from more than 2,100 business establishments in 10 countries3 identified reg -
ulatory issues in the field of privacy, data security, and the legal status of e-transactions as the biggest barriers to e-commerce adoption.
4 Data from the 
same survey show that small firms in South Asia view customs procedures for e-commerce shipment as one of the major 
 challenges 
for developing 
 e
-commerce in the region. Likewise, digital 
 pa
yments are a big constraint, 
especially in the context of cross-border transactions. Surveyed small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) reported that removing regulatory and logistical challenges to e-commerce would increase their exports, employ -
ment, and productivity by as much as 20–30 percent. Meetings with the pri-vate sector conducted by the World Bank team in Nepal, India, and Sri Lanka corroborated these challenges and highlighted other regulatory constraints pertaining to consumer protection. 
What are the operating models for firms in digital space?
Various models of digital trade exist, each involving a different combination of parties (OECD 2017). For instance, business-to-government (B2G) transactions see businesses selling to governments; business-to-business (B2B) transactions involve two enterprises (including when enterprises are part of the same group, as is the case for multinational corporations); and, analogously, consumer-
 
to
-consumer transactions involve two consumers directly transacting with each 
other (for example, using eBay). Finally, business-to-consumer (B2C) transac -
tions involve businesses selling directly to households, bypassing traditional retailers. Even within each category, the variety of practical e-commerce appli-cations is substantial.
E-commerce firms—for example, those engaged in B2C transactions in goods 
or services—operate with a range of business models. First, one must distinguish between single-brand, stand-alone websites, where individual companies sell their products through their own electronic portal, and multibrand, online plat -
forms that showcase the products of multiple sellers. Each of these major mod-els, in turn, is an umbrella for several different solutions that can be observed in practice. For example, firms such as Amazon and Flipkart are online portals with multibrand retailing. Even within these broader platforms, the big e-commerce players have three sets of possible models: inventory-based, marketplace, and online malls. Other possibilities involve a combination of these three models. The identified models, with some examples of South Asian firms in each cate -
gory, are visualized in figure 1.2.Understanding E-Commerce | 11
In the stand-alone model, an e-commerce firm sells its products through its 
own website. This can be established in various ways, from adding an e-commerce 
function to an existing website; to using a “software as a service” solution (using website templates that have all the features needed for e-commerce); to building an ad hoc, customized e-commerce site. These options span different levels of flexibility and demand in terms of resources and technical skills. On the one hand, low-cost solutions are relatively straightforward to set up and operate but might result in unprofessional-looking websites and less-than-efficient services. On the other hand, more customized solutions are better tailored to the firm’s needs but are more expensive and more demanding in ICT-intensive skills. In India, Handicraft Ventures and GreenDust are examples of firms that provide niche goods and services, respectively, and that have been able to set up their own elec -
tronic portals. Handicraft Ventures is engaged in manufacturing and exporting customized, handmade Indian artifacts and products to Europe and the United States. The products offered by the firm range from brass designer handicrafts, to leather products, to sculptures and paintings, with an emphasis on the premium quality and uniqueness of each piece. GreenDust is a reverse logistics firm and online shopping site. After collecting unused, branded factory seconds, surplus, overstock, and refurbished products (mostly electronics) from manufacturers and repairing them, the firm offers customers and bulk buyers the option to purchase these products at discount prices on its platform. In Sri Lanka, oDoc provides con-sumers with access to electronic consultations with doctors,  
Electronic or online platforms are third-party marketplaces for marketing 
and selling products online. They may differ in the geographical focus (purely national, or open to international buyers or sellers, or both) and in the range of services offered (like showcasing, payment solutions, and handling of orders). Regardless of the geographical scope, three different models for online plat -
forms can be identified: (a) pure marketplace, (b) online mall, and (c) self-owned inventory. In the pure marketplace model, sellers offer their products on the marketplace’s website, where the products are showcased along with those FIGURE 1.2

of competitors. The marketplace may offer additional services—like advertising, 
customer relations, and delivery—but sellers need to manage their inventory autonomously. eBay is an example of the marketplace model. Among service firms, the most prominent marketplaces for tradable services are in the travel business (examples in India are yatra.com and makemytrip.com), whereas local-ized services can be used for transport (for example, Ola is the Indian equivalent of Uber or Lyft) or for apartment renting (in India and many other countries, Oyo functions as a hotel chain as well and has moved into Airbnb-type homestays). In online malls, a seller partners with a marketplace to set up a dedicated online store on the latter’s website. The store will be a single-brand entity, where cus-tomers can browse the entire range of products sold online by the company rather than searching by item. Here, sellers still play a key role in managing inventory. An example of an online mall is Paytm in India. In the case of the self-owned inventory model, the platform owns the inventory and controls delivery, and thus has more efficient control of the supply chain, warehousing, and 
 shipments
. Amazon, Snapdeal, and Alibaba are probably the best-known inter -
national examples of this model, although regulatory barriers on foreign owner -
ship prevent them from holding their own inventories in many South Asian countries (see the next section). The model allows for smoother operations and overall better customer relations (quality control and handling of complaints, returns, and refunds) and shifts the burden of inventory risk to the platform. 
How do regulations distort the operating 
models of e-commerce firms? 
Each model has its own advantages, which determine a firm’s choice on the basis 
of its characteristics. For example, consultations with private sector players—such as Handicraft Ventures in India, Takas in Sri Lanka, and Muncha in Nepal—suggest that own portals are the preferred transacting model for firms that are relatively well established. Own electronic portals could also be more suitable when the firm sells nonstandardized and niche products. A stand-alone website offers more flexibility in functionalities, payment options, geographical scope, and design, and it does not have to conform to third-party policies (for example, on returns and refunds or stringent and expensive inventory requirements). As a result, firms with a strong brand or relatively higher capabilities, or those selling niche products, may find it optimal to work through their own portals. Selling on platforms, by contrast, allows the seller to leverage the platform’s 
 r
eputation, infrastructure, and existing pool of buyers, which makes platforms 
particularly suitable for smaller firms or companies offering standardized 
 pr
oducts. Smaller sellers are likely to benefit the most from inventory-type 
 platforms
, which allow them to operate online even with limited logistical 
capabilities. 
Firm choice is distorted by existing regulations in South Asia. For example, in 
countries such as India and Sri Lanka, foreign multibrand retailers cannot have their own inventory, and international giants like Amazon, Flipkart, and Daraz must operate as pure marketplaces. This may have consequences for market access for small firms with limited digital and logistical skills because it reduces the options available to these small retailers and producers (for example, in their ability to hold inventory and manage liquidity). 
Restrictions on payment methods and foreign exchange controls can have a 
substantial impact on the strategic choices of private sector players, especially Understanding E-Commerce | 13
when  dealing with cr oss-border transactions. Field interviews in Sri Lanka and 
Nepal revealed how some entrepreneurs, to sell more conveniently in interna-
tional marketplaces, open subsidiaries overseas (for example, in Australia, Singapore, or the United States). Although this allows them to receive interna-tional payments and fulfill international orders, it may not be the most 
 efficient 
method of operation because it involves additional overhead and 
transaction costs.
NOTES
1. B astos Tigre and Dedrick (2004) report inadequate regulation on privacy and security, lack 
of business laws for e-commerce, inadequate legal protection for Internet purchases, and 
concern about Internet taxation as the key issues identified by Brazilian consumers on low e-commerce adoption. In China, the lack of transactional and institutional trust related to the weak rule of law represents a major impediment to e-commerce (Efendioglu and Yip 2004; Gibbs, Kraemer, and Dedrick 2003). Similarly, Oxley and Yeung (2001) show that e-commerce activity depends on a supportive institutional environment, and Shih, Dedrick, and Kraemer (2005) find that the rule of law is an important factor determining the will-ingness of businesses and consumers to engage in e-commerce. Moreover, Shih, Dedrick, and Kraemer show that various potential facilitators or enablers of e-commerce (like finan-cial resources, experience with direct marketing, and availability of payment facilitators) only matter when the rule of law is strong. They report that firms worldwide identify reg -
ulatory issues in the field of privacy, data security, and e-transactions as the biggest barriers to e-commerce adoption. More recently, Couture et al. (2017) find that, when not accom-panied by other complementary interventions to support the transition to local online trad-ing activity, the benefits of e-commerce are unlikely to materialize in the short to medium run.

ducted from March to May 2018 and covered 1,688 merchants in nine major sec -
tors, plus 539 e-commerce ecosystem firms (such as e-commerce and payment platforms and logistics, financial services, and information technology services firms) that service merchants across seven economies (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka). The random sample was con-structed in two ways: about two-thirds of the respondents responded to an online survey, and the remaining one-third responded to a computer-assisted telephone interview.
In the region, 31 percent of the surveyed firms reported selling and buying 
online, 27 percent reported only selling online, 10 percent reported only buying online, and about 31 percent reported neither selling nor buying online (
 figur
e 2.1). Online sales activity appears to be somewhat correlated with firm 
size, with large firms (defined by the survey as those with more than 250 
 emplo
yees) being more likely to sell online than their smaller counterparts.
The surveyed companies that reported online sales (that is, those that sell 
online or sell and buy online) are much more internationalized than those that neither buy nor sell goods or services online. For example, while only 17 percent of small South Asian companies that do not have online sales or purchases report any export activity, 48 percent of small companies that do sell and buy online report export activity (figure 2.2). Moreover, online sellers are more diversified in their export markets than offline sellers: while offline sellers sell mostly to their domestic market or to one or two export markets, around 40 percent of online sellers cater to more than three foreign markets. Online traders also seem more likely to grow fast: 33 percent of the surveyed online sellers saw revenue growth of 10 percent or higher in 2016–17 , whereas only 21 percent of the inter -
viewees reported this type of revenue growth among offline sellers.
The most frequently cited challenges to the adoption of e-commerce, among 
the surveyed South Asian firms that did not report any online sales, include con-cerns about the cost of selling online, together with uncertainty about the result -
ing return on investment. In addition, these firms often mentioned inadequate connectivity and information technology (IT) infrastructure as substantial 
 hur
dles preventing their online activity.Constraints on E-Commerce
RESULTS FROM THE E-COMMERCE 
DEVELOPMENT SURVEY16 | U NLEASHING  E-C OMMERCE  FOR  SOUTH  ASIAN  INTEGRATION
Logistics, digital regulations, and connectivity are 
cited as the main challenges among online sellers, 
including both large and small firms, whereas online payments, e-commerce logistics, connectivity, and IT infrastructure appear to be significant constraints for small firms in particular (figure 2.3).
Much of the South Asian firms’ international e-trade 
tends to be with extraregional partners, such as China, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Within international or cross-border e-commerce, the key obstacles are logistics (such as clearing customs for e-commerce imports and exports) and connectivity and digital regulations in other countries (figure 2.4). Compared with exporters, nonexporters also report being concerned about their own capabilities for doing cross-border e-commerce and about access to trade finance.
These assessments vary quite significantly across 
countries. For example, small sellers in Afghanistan are particularly constrained by access to trade finance, 
while firms in Pakistan and Bangladesh cite connectivity and IT backbone as significant hurdles for cross-border e-commerce. Digital regulations appear to be a concern for firms in all countries (figure 2.5).FIGURE 2.1

Small South Asian online sellers are especially concerned about the cost of 
logistics to the end buyer, the complexities of customs clearance, the functioning 
of online payments, and basic digital infrastructure such as the cost of broadband and the population’s digital literacy. Although the challenges vary somewhat across countries, logistics and market access and online payment issues appear to trouble small online sellers in each economy. Furthermore, there appears to be concern across the region about online fraud—such as with counterparties’ iden-tities, data piracy, and payments fraud. Indian firms, which tend to be more dig -
itized and more heavily concentrated in service sectors than firms in the other countries, tended to highlight regulatory issues—such as tax rules, legal liability laws, and data piracy challenges—among their top challenges to engaging with e-commerce. 
The ecosystem firms highlighted many challenges arising from digital regu-
latory issues as well. These include online Internet portal protection rules, cybersecurity issues, and over-the-top rules, such as the application of rigid broadcast and telecom rules on Internet intermediaries. Ecosystem firms also gave a low score to the functioning of online payments and merchants’ capabili-ties to engage in e-commerce. Digital illiteracy and digital identity concerns were highlighted as substantial challenges by merchants and ecosystem firms.
Cross-border e-commerce faces many hurdles. Firms in Afghanistan, 
Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan all rated the cost of cross-border logistics as being among their top 10 specific hurdles, while firms in Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka said that taxes and trade barriers in export markets are among their main challenges (table 2.1).
If their top three e-commerce problems were resolved, South Asian firms 
expect substantial benefits in exports, employment, and production growth 
 (

Appropriate regulations can help unleash the potential of e-commerce to reduce 
transaction 
 cos
ts. Regulatory hurdles that businesses face when engaging in 
e-commerce can relate to five focus areas: (a) consumer protection, (b) data pro -
tection and privacy, (c) e-transactions and e-signatures, (d) cybersecurity,1 and 
(e) market access and investment-related policy 
 measur
es. The presence or 
absence and quality of these regulations can shape in various ways the ability of e-commerce to reduce transaction 
 cos
ts. Moreover, the lack of a clear regulatory 
framework is critically constraining e-commerce, not just in South Asia (at the national and intraregional levels), but globally as 
 w
ell. For example, the European 
Commission attributes the slow pace of online transactions to the complicated and unclear regulatory 
 fr
amework.2 Private sector consultations in Nepal and 
Sri Lanka also pointed to the lack of clarity in regulations that leaves young entrepreneurs in “gray” areas, who are later identified as 
 noncompliant.
 
Consumer protection directly affects search costs on digital platforms, con-
sidering the asymmetric information between seller and buyer on the products and services being sold 
 online
. This asymmetry of information requires greater 
responsibilities on the part of the seller, such as the provision of warranties and refund 
 arr
angements. Online transactions also have legal uncertainty in 
enforcement and the relevant jurisdiction for consumer 
 complaints
. And digital 
commerce is more prone to fraud and 
 deception. E
ffective protection of 
 consumers’ rights is critical for the de
velopment of 
 e
-commerce. Because con-
sumers 
 cannot ph
ysically examine the products, they are unsure of the quality 
of their  pur
chases, which makes the return policy an important factor in their 
online purchase 
 decisions
. At the same time, an excessive regulatory burden can 
inhibit entry by small enterprises into this 
 mark
et. For instance, the adoption of 
the “country-of-destination” principle (which allows international consumers to rely on the consumer protection granted to them by their domestic law) could be a counterproductive approach when consumer protection standards are quite heterogeneous across 
 countries
. 
When it comes to contracting costs, regulation of electronic transactions 
and signatures and data privacy is  par
amount. Given the paperless nature of 
e-transactions, it is crucial to find mechanisms for the identification of par -
ties and the authentication of commercial 
 t
ransactions. In this sense, a Eliminating Transaction Costs 
through E-Commerce
POLICIES AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL22 | U NLEASHING  E-C OMMERCE  FOR  SOUTH  ASIAN  INTEGRATION
central issue is the legal recognition of electronic and digital signatures, so 
that both parties can be assured of the validity of their  tr
ansaction. 
Establishing the full validity of transactions and signatures performed online, however, requires the collection of a large amount of personal data, whose treatment in turn involves delicate 
 tr
ade-offs. On the one hand, consumers 
are reluctant to engage in online transactions if they are uncertain about the confidentiality of their 
 data. On the other hand, e
xcessively rigid data protec -
tion 
 s
tandards are likely to cause frictions in the e-commerce space and may 
create restrictions on market 
 access
. 
The lack of or inadequate enforcement of rules on electronic payments 
deters the potential of e-commerce to abate payment 
 cos
ts. Anonymity and the 
paperless nature of transactions performed over the Internet require a legal status through a solid base of legitimacy and credibility (Pappas 2002). Digital transaction laws on e-signatures and payment solutions can provide exactly this 
 
legitimacy.3 Specific e-payment regulations are needed to limit legal uncertain-
ties and account for new technologies and e-payment alternatives to 
 c
ards.4 
These challenges could be addressed when payment mechanisms, such as that 
offered by PayPal, are allowed to emerge or when transactions are conducted with firms that are highly sensitive about their 
 r
eputation. Nonetheless, if these 
mechanisms are not automatic or regulations inhibit the entry of firms such as PayPal, then it may be worthwhile to explore mechanisms for the identification of parties and authentication of commercial 
 tr
ansactions. In this sense, the legal 
recognition of electronic and digital signatures could become a critical issue such that both parties in a transaction can be assured that the validity of their interaction is not hampered by its paperless 
 form. In addition, ther
e is also the 
need to strengthen regulatory symmetry between financial institutions and other payment agents, to foster a level playing field and a competitive environ-ment for e-payment providers (Olsen et 
 al. 2015).
 
Cybercrime is of growing concern to countries at all levels of development 
and affects buyers and 
 sellers
. Cybercrime broadly includes hacking, data dam-
ages, stolen funds, theft of intellectual property, and theft of data (USITC 2017). In 2012, an estimated US$3.5 billion was lost in supplier revenue because of online fraud (CyberSource 2013). As a result, governments require that the information technology (IT) systems used by their citizens are secure, and that governments are introducing various forms of regulation to ensure that data 
and digitally supported services have adequate levels of 
 pr
otection. This is par -
ticularly relevant for broad certification requirements, encryption regulation, content control, and intellectual property rights 
 la
w. 
Finally, delivery, tax, and regulatory compliance costs are determined by 
market access and investment restriction 
 measur
es. Market access regulations 
can further constrain the development of 
 e
-commerce. For example, regula-
tions relating to low thresholds for de minimis, additional compliance burdens on foreign firms, or the taxation of e-commerce sales on the basis of arbitrary rules can have a severe impact on investment in digital services (USITC 2017). In addition, there could be restrictions on the delivery methods, such as local ownership of logistics providers, or on the flexibility allowed to such 
 pr
oviders. 
All these measures increase the cost of doing business internationally and pre -
dictably result in distorted business flows and lost market 
 opportunities
. 
Appropriate e-commerce regulations, if instituted and implemented, may help circumvent these 
 barriers
.Eliminating Transaction Costs through E-Commerce | 23
CONSUMER PROTECTION
Consumer protection regulations make provisions for respecting consumers’ 
rights and penalize fraudulent business 
 pr
actices. Considering the extent of 
information asymmetry that exists between sellers and buyers on the Internet, consumers are particularly vulnerable to deceptive and fraudulent activities when purchasing goods or services 
 online
. Therefore, consumer protection laws 
are meant to limit as far as possible the exposure of consumers to misleading, fraudulent, and unfair commercial 
 pr
actices. This is achieved by clarifying the 
requirements of doing business online within a particular jurisdiction for busi-nesses engaged in e-commerce, or by providing consumers with effective redress mechanisms, or again by empowering them through awareness, education, and training in IT skills (European Commission 2016; UNCTAD 2013b, 2015
 a).
 
Consumer protection regulations help identify online sellers, through regis-
tration rules or enforcement of certain technology (for example, 
 encryption).
 
The requirement that evidence of any transaction be provided, or that consum-ers’ consent be explicitly sought in relation to potentially harmful contract clauses,
5 are meaningful examples of attempts at limiting the adverse effects of 
information asymmetries (Binding and Purnhagen 2011; Kilic and Israel 2015; UNCTAD 2015
 b). S
uch regulations are also critical for the development of busi-
nesses’ self-regulatory systems (OECD 2000). Although self-regulation alone has been deemed insufficient to provide adequate consumer protection (Budnitz 1998), various countries, like China or the United States, have supervised and supported the establishment of industry self-regulation and codes of conduct, together with the activities of consumer organizations (Binding and Purnhagen 2011; Boritz and No 2011).
6 This report acknowledges that consumer protection 
may not be central to the constraints crippling the growth of e-commerce in South Asia, where firms with reputational capital may offer credible forms of consumer protection, going beyond legal 
 norms
. 
Homogenizing international consumer protection frameworks can poten-
tially encourage higher participation in 
 e
-commerce. Studies suggest that the 
many different levels of consumer protection distort cross-border competition in European Union member states and create incentives for producers and con-sumers to transact in their home 
 mark
ets. Yet, businesses operating in various 
countries can benefit from a one-stop-shop approach, whereby it becomes sim-pler, faster, and cheaper to resolve consumer issues (European Commission 2016). Moreover, consistent cross-border enforcement of consumer legislation increases legal certainty and reduces legal costs when implementing marketing on foreign 
 platforms
.
DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY
Data privacy regulations offer individuals the right to control their personal 
 information. This 
right covers various aspects of personal information with 
respect to its collection, use, and transfer by entities engaged in e-commerce (Boritz and No 2011). In a digital commerce setting, privacy is violated whenever personal information that can be linked to an individual or used to identify an individual is collected, used, or transferred without authorization, as a direct result of an e-commerce transaction (Milberg, Smith, and Burke 2000; 24 | U NLEASHING  E-C OMMERCE  FOR  SOUTH  ASIAN  INTEGRATION
Petty 2000; Rezgui, Bouguettaya, and Eltoweissy 2003). Where data protection 
regulations are in place, any transaction or online activity involving the transfer of sensitive information (including the collection of browsing history data using so-called “web cookies”)
7 becomes subject to scrutiny to avoid any unauthorized 
breach of individual 
 priv
acy.8
Data protection practices should be inspired by a set of core principles 
(UNCTAD 2016). To begin, organizations engaging in e-commerce should openly disclose their personal data 
 policies
. Then, the collection of personal 
data must be limited, lawful, and fair, and consumers must be aware of it and explicitly give their 
 consent. The purpose of collection and (e
ventual) disclo -
sure of personal data must in any case be specified at the time of collection, and data use or disclosure must be limited to the purposes specified or to closely related 
 purposes
. The “data minimization” principle in addition 
requires that data not directly relevant to the purpose of collection are not 
 collected. F
urthermore, the collected personal data must be subject to appro -
priate security safeguards and be relevant, accurate, and up-to-date—which also means that data subjects must have appropriate rights to access and cor -
rect their personal 
 data. Finally
, data controllers must take responsibility for 
ensuring compliance with the data protection 
 principles
.
Data privacy regulation requires a delicate balance between adequate levels 
of protection and sufficient degrees of freedom for business 
 activity
. This often 
requires trading off consumer confidence and smooth market operations, at the risk of creating negative market effects either way (UNCTAD 2016; USITC 2013). For example, Graef, Wahyuningtyas, and Valcke (2015) document how, in the case of online platforms, successful companies might foreclose competition by raising barriers to entry in the collection of user data, thereby damaging competitors and new entrants that need access to those data to provide com-peting or complementary 
 services
. New challenges are also posed by recent 
innovations in information and communications technology (ICT), such as cloud services,
9 the Internet of Things,10 and big data analytics,11 which are rev -
olutionizing the way in which social, economic, and financial activities are cur -
rently undertaken, but at the same time rely on personal-data-intensive technologies and processes (UNCTAD 2016).
Countries have adopted two distinct approaches to data protection and pri-
vacy 
 measur
es. Countries follow a comprehensive (“omnibus”) approach—  
r
egulating data flows across all sectors of the economy—or a sectoral 
approach—applying different regimes to specific industries, such as financial 
 
services.12 Examples of countries applying these approaches are the European 
Union and the United States, 
 r
espectively. 
Data protection policies in a cross-border context need to be designed care -
fully so that they do not result in disguised 
 pr
otectionism. The risk of such poli-
cies lies in placing international competitors at a disadvantage compared with their domestic 
 counterparts
. In various countries, the law mandates that compa-
nies maintain privacy policies restricting the processing of sensitive personal data for international transfers, and that foreign companies using domestic data have their computing facilities within the national borders (Kilic and Israel 2015; Swedish National Board of Trade 2012; UNCTAD 2016). In the case of consumer protection, it is not clear that data protection would be foremost among con -
sumer concerns in South Asia; nonetheless, it is an area in which South Asian governments are increasing regulatory 
 o
versight. Eliminating Transaction Costs through E-Commerce | 25
E-TRANSACTIONS, DIGITAL SIGNATURES, E-PAYMENTS, 
AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION
Purchasing online is still not a widespread option in many South Asian 
 countries
. Although global online purchases account for about 16 percent of 
total purchases, and the figure is more than 60 percent in developed markets 
such as the Republic of Korea and the United States, South Asian countries like Bangladesh stand at only 1 
 per
cent. Among various reasons, the anonymity and 
paperless nature of transactions performed over the Internet seem to consti-tute a serious obstacle for digital 
 tr
ansactions. A survey of Indian consumers 
revealed that most shoppers look for information online but then purchase the items offline because they need to “touch and feel” the product or they have security concerns (IAMAI and Kantar IMRB 2016). This trust gap can only be filled by building a solid base of legitimacy and credibility for electronic trans-actions (Pappas 2002). 
Digital transaction laws on e-signatures and payment solutions can provide 
some of this 
 legitimacy
.13 First, specific e-payment regulations are needed to 
limit legal uncertainties and account for new technologies and e-payment alter -
natives to credit and debit cards (Miao and Jayakar 2016; Olsen et 
 al. 2015).14 
Olsen et 
 al. (2015) also s
tress the need to strengthen regulatory symmetry 
between financial institutions and other payment agents to foster a level playing field and competitive environment for e-payment 
 pr
oviders. Then, the priority 
is to find mechanisms for the identification of parties and the authentication of commercial 
 tr
ansactions. In this sense, a central issue is the legal recognition of 
electronic and digital signatures, so that both parties in a transaction can rest assured that the validity of their interaction is not hampered by its paperless 
 
form.
The legal treatment of digital signatures relies on three fundamental com-
ponents: public key infrastructure technology, the role of certificate authori-ties, and the choice between technological neutrality and legal specificity (Bhatia 2003). First, the purpose of public key infrastructure is to enable e-commerce participants to authenticate each other, communicate in a confi-dential way, and provide electronic documents with a legally binding digital 
 signatur
e. Second, the validity and authenticity of the signature are then 
ensured by the certificate authority, which certifies that a particular public key belongs to the actual 
 sender
. Therefore, the establishment of rules for the 
licensing and recognition of certificate authorities lies at the core of any regu-lation on digital signatures (Bhatia 2003; Binding and Purnhagen 2011; Murad 2010; Penbera 1999). Third, e-transaction legislation can have various degrees of specificity as to which technologies can be considered valid in the issuance of digital signatures and the respective 
 certificates
. A country is technologi-
cally neutral when there is no explicit prescription of a particular type of tech-nology; it is legal-specific when there are legally defined, specific public key infrastructure rules (Bhatia 2003).
The treatment of electronic and digital signatures represents a nonnegli-
gible obstacle to cross-border 
 tr
ansactions. Different countries follow differ -
ent legal approaches and require more or less stringent standards for the licensing of certificate authorities or authentication of signatures and notari-zation of 
 tr
ansactions. Consequently, what is perfectly legal in one country 
might not meet the legal requirements in another, creating additional costs 26 | U NLEASHING  E-C OMMERCE  FOR  SOUTH  ASIAN  INTEGRATION
for firms trying to expand their activities abroad (Kilic and Israel 2015; 
USITC 2013, 2017).
The lack of a systematic dispute resolution mechanism in an international 
context complicates cross-border trade through 
 e
-commerce. UNCTAD 
(2015a) reports an increasing number of cross-border disputes and fewer case settlements, which calls for the establishment of a coordinated method for resolving online disputes (Olsen et 
 al
. 2015). However, apart from nota-
ble exceptions like the European Union, there have been very few regional- or 
 international-le
vel facilities to settle cross-border disputes to 
 date
. 
Therefore, disputes are usually dealt with by specific jurisdictions chosen by the parties upon closing a 
 tr
ansaction. The agreement on the choice of juris-
diction is a common practice in international contracts, which allows the parties to choose a court (or courts) to settle future disputes, or a dispute that has already taken 
 place
. The selected court will have exclusive jurisdiction to 
decide, unless agreed on otherwise by the 
 parties
. In e-commerce contracts, 
however, jurisdiction clauses are commonly included in the general condi-tions of contracting, whose acceptance by the end user is often obtained through the click-wrapping 
 t
echnique.15 As such, the choice of court agree-
ment incorporated into the contract might easily go unnoticed, which raises concerns as to the existence of an actual agreement between the parties (Gonçalves De Sousa 2017).
CYBERSECURITY
To ensure cybersecurity, countries need to work on critical information infra-structure 
 r
egulations. These generally include some broad certification 
 r
equirements, such as yearly certification processes and attestations (Friedman 
2013). Some countries at the extreme end of the spectrum demand full access not just to the products or software, but also to the underlying source 
 code
. That has 
recently been the case for Brazil, China, and Indonesia, which required source code disclosure to relevant government authorities as a prerequisite for firms to operate within their borders (USITC 2017). Clearly, source code may not be securely stored everywhere, giving rise to risks of intellectual property rights 
 infringement. Consequently
, it is often the case that firms shy away from certain 
industries and countries, and that cybersecurity regulations may result in (only to an extent) trade 
 r
estrictions.
Encryption regulations are also critical for ensuring 
 cybersecurity
.16 
Encryption enables users to protect the confidentiality of their data and 
 communications
. Restrictions on encryption use imposed—for example, by 
China, India, or the United Kingdom—are rationalized on the grounds that they reduce the risk of transmission of information that may enable harmful 
 activities
. 
However, inadequate standards pose a risk of reducing the security and privacy of digital 
 goods
. For instance, USITC (2017) reports that India’s encryption reg -
ulations require firms to use a 40-bit or lower standard encryption to secure digitally transmitted information, while most 
 U
.S. firms are using stronger stan-
dards (ranging from 128-bit to 256  -bit). Ther
efore, digital trade between the 
United States and India requires that 
 U
.S. firms procure a license to use their 
(more sophisticated and secure) cryptography standards with Indian businesses or 
 
consumers. Eliminating Transaction Costs through E-Commerce | 27
Content control is also often justified on the grounds of  cybersecurity . 
Content control is the outright blocking or filtering by governments of their 
Internet platforms and 
 content. As for other ins
tances of cybersecurity regula-
tion, the enactment of such actions may well be justified by overarching princi-ples, such as the need for protection of national security, public order, or human 
 life
. For instance, various European countries (including France, Italy, and the 
United Kingdom) block websites that promote terrorism or child 
 pornogr
aphy. 
However, incidents of outright censorship are becoming increasingly common and usually impose costs on the economies of the countries implementing 
 them.
 
On the basis of an analysis of 81 short-term Internet shutdowns in 19 countries, West (2016) estimates that shutdowns resulted in at least US$2.4 billion in for -
gone world gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015 and 2016. 
Violation of intellectual property rights (online piracy) is ever more 
 perv
asive. 
Online piracy of television episodes and movies, for example, is estimated to have cost the global content industry US$32 billion in 2017 , and this is forecast to grow to US$52 billion in lost revenue by 2022 (FICCI and EY 2018). Other than contributing to innovation, creativity, and commerce, the access to large amounts of content granted by the Internet to potentially every broadband user has led to large-scale abuses of intellectual property rights, which can occur through a variety of means and 
 de
vices. Instances of intellectual property rights violations 
include the infringement of patents, copyrights, and author rights, as well as the unauthorized sale of franchise goods, counterfeit or smuggled goods, and the misuse of brands and trademarks (Binding and Purnhagen 2011; Primo Braga 2005; UNCTAD 2017a, 2017
 b). U
SITC (2013) also identifies unauthorized soft -
ware installation onto PCs, mobile devices, and media boxes,17 and end-user soft -
ware piracy as examples of the 
 same
.18 Other digital-era-specific examples are 
cybersquatting19 and the misuse of website and domain names (Binding and 
Purnhagen 2011; UNCTAD 2015
 b).
 
In India, the film industry alone is estimated to lose US$2.8 billion of its total 
revenue to piracy every year, but piracy rates may be even higher for other types of content (FICCI and EY 2018). Revenue leakages for Indian films may be around 10–30 percent of revenue, and losses may be even higher for music, soft -
ware, and 
 games
.20 The content industry is also reported to suffer substantially 
from piracy, especially the illegal sharing of local television programming (Liang and Sundaram 2011) and streaming of sport matches (FICCI and EY 2018). Moreover, the globalization of Bollywood and the large Indian diaspora have helped to make film and content piracy an international 
 business
. Indian tracker 
sites receive substantial shares of their traffic from Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, as well as from Australia, Canada, Dubai, Qatar, the United Kingdom, and the United States (Liang and Sundaram 2011). Deloitte (2016) further reports that, among the more than 150 websites offering pirated versions of Indian films, almost two-thirds are located 
 abr
oad. 
A strong legal framework and effective enforcement mechanisms could com-
bat online 
 p
iracy. The extent to which these conditions are met in different 
countries crucially determines the profitability of cross-border 
 activities
. 
For example, in the United States, focus group representatives of the content industries
21 identified Internet piracy as the single most important barrier to 
 digital tr
ade for their industries (USITC 2013). In particular, the Office of the 
 U
.S. 
Trade Representative (USTR 2016) estimates the value of losses to 
 U
.S. produc -
ers from piracy of music and movies in India at around US$4 billion per year, and 28 | U NLEASHING  E-C OMMERCE  FOR  SOUTH  ASIAN  INTEGRATION
the commercial value of unlicensed software used in India at about US$3  billion.  
Moreover, controversies often arise as to the liability of Internet service provid-
ers (ISPs) for providing bona fide access to copyright-infringing content (USITC 2017). ISPs lament regulations that are too stringent that hold them accountable for providing transient or incidental access in which the access is not expressly prohibited by the copyright holder; however, many judicial and regulatory 
 sys
tems have been shifting the burden to ISPs to monitor their 
 content.22 Given 
the above, cybercrime presents complicated enforcement and jurisdictional problems and demands greater international cooperation in the context of cross-
 
bor
der interactions (UNCTAD 2015
 a).
MARKET ACCESS REGULATIONS
Specific market access regulations for e-commerce can play a critical role in promoting healthy competition between domestic and foreign businesses (OECD 2017). For instance, many cross-border packages are likely the result of direct business-to-consumer (B2C) online 
 tr
ansactions. Low de minimis limits, 
which require exporters to pay customs duties and taxes and comply with stan-dard customs procedures for shipments above a certain threshold, can distort competition for e-commerce 
 r
etailers. Low thresholds act as a significant obsta-
cle to cross-border transactions, especially in the context of small-scale online retail purchases, whose cost and processing times can increase significantly because they pay a fixed and a variable cost over every low-value 
 tr
ansaction. 
This burden is further exacerbated by a distinct lack of transparency from many customs agencies about the compliance process, which can differ significantly from destination to destination (USITC 2013).
“Geo-blocking” presents another practical barrier to e-trade (European 
Commission 2016; Kilic and Israel 2015). Geo-blocking refers to practices that result in the denial of access to websites from other countries, or in the inability to access products or services for sale on those websites (for example, because payment is only accepted if made with a credit card from a certain 
 country). The
 
European Commission (2016) points out how these practices equally affect con-sumers and businesses as end users of products and 
 services
.
Measures that favor domestic industry at the expense of foreign competitors, 
so-called localization barriers, also constitute a constraint on market access  
(Stone, Messent, and Flaig 2015). Localization barriers can manifest in the form of local content requirements, such as mandatory national sourcing of goods or 
 services
. Audiovisual quotas, for example, place limits on the number of foreign 
films that can enter the market, cap the percent of time that radio or television stations can play foreign content, or set a minimum play time for domestically produced content (USTR 2013). USITC (2013) notes that, as people consume more media online, these requirements are expanding into trade in digital 
 pr
oducts—such as movies, music, and e-books—to the detriment of companies 
selling their content in foreign 
 mark
ets. 
Regulations that require foreign companies to adopt local standards 
restrict entry in the digital 
 space
. These regulations often comprise complying 
with country- or region-specific technical standards or carrying out unneces -
sary, duplicative conformity assessment procedures in the country where firms 
 oper
ate. Discriminatory regulations that impose country-specific technical 
standards or local testing requirements on hardware and software products Eliminating Transaction Costs through E-Commerce | 29
raise the costs of new technologies for consumers and businesses and can seri-
ously limit firms’ ability to sell digital products across borders (USITC 2017).
Regulations can also specifically target foreign direct investment 
 (F
DI). 
Foreign ownership rules can establish an equity cap for foreign equity participa-tion or mandate joint ventures with domestic partners, which often requires a transfer of technology to the host 
 country
. For example, foreign ownership in all 
telecom services in Brazil is capped at 49 percent, and China requires that major -
ity ownership in cloud computing be held by a local joint venture (USITC 2017). In India, 100 percent foreign investment in business-to-business e-commerce is permitted; however, the multibrand B2C segment is subject to many restrictions, including FDI not being permitted in the inventory-based model of 
 e
-commerce. 
Other, more subtle barriers to entry are onerous licensing and capital 
 r
equirements, large fees, and burdensome approval processes that target foreign 
 entities
. For instance, Indonesia has proposed to require foreign IT service 
 pr
oviders to set up an affiliate in Indonesia to do business in the country, with a 
process that would entail burdensome registration with the IT regulator and the Investment Coordinating Board (USITC 2017).
The taxation of e-commerce poses several challenges as 
 w
ell. High 
 e
-commerce import taxes serve the double purpose of shielding domestic indus-
tries from competition (USITC 2017) and providing a significant source of tariff revenue (Bastos Tigre and O’Connor 2002). Governments have various degrees of freedom in shaping their e-commerce tax framework (Primo Braga 2005). First, because soft goods (for example, software, books, and music) can be classi-fied as goods or services, the definition of digital goods is a nontrivial point, espe -
cially if services are not taxed in the relevant tax 
 jurisdiction. Similarly
, the 
characterization of income generated by e-commerce (business profits or royalty income) has implications for income tax 
 collection. 
Furthermore, the definition 
of “place of permanent establishment” for e-commerce enterprises has implica-tions for indirect tax and income tax: for instance, a firm may have a website hosted by a local ISP despite being physically based abroad, but local authorities could tax sales associated with that website if having the local website qualifies as evidence of permanent establishment (Bastos Tigre and O’Connor 2002; Primo Braga 2005).

enforcement of consumers’ rights, stop unjustified geo-blocking, and increase the trans-parency of parcel delivery

Although online transactions are “space blind” and reforms facilitating them 
ought to be at a global scale, there is a strong justification to emphasize the importance of e-commerce in South 
 Asia. Giv
en that the transactions on digital 
platforms are blind to distance as long as delivery can be conducted efficiently, is there an argument in favor of placing this debate at a regional level? Kathuria (2018) justifies this claim by pointing out that the region discriminates against itself—and offers regional e-commerce a valuable opportunity to play the 
 balancing 
 act. In addition, wher
e distance matters, as in the provision of ser -
vices where physical presence is needed (for example, transport), regional 
 e
-commerce has a natural 
 adv
antage.
Given the borderless nature of online transactions, no single government can 
unilaterally regulate 
 e
-commerce. Thus, cooperation among nations, regions, 
and international organizations to harmonize the existing rules and offer clarity, certainty, and predictability in online business activity is essential, as shown in table 4.1.
E-COMMERCE AND SEARCH COSTS: EMPOWERING 
CONSUMERS THROUGH PLATFORMS
India’s new Consumer Protection Bill, 2019, which replaces the old Consumer 
Protection Act of 1986, enforces consumer 
 pr
otection. More specifically, the 
bill enforces consumer rights and provides a mechanism for redressal of complaints about defects in goods and deficiency in 
 services
. The bill applies 
to all goods and services, as well as to all modes of transaction, including online and 
 teleshopping
. Although the 1986 act did not feature any provision 
governing digital transactions, the 2019 bill clearly defines direct selling, e-commerce, and an electronic service provider, enabling the central govern-ment to prescribe rules against unfair trade practices in e-commerce and direct 
 
selling. 
Many other South Asian countries appear to be lagging in consumer protec -
tion vis-à-vis other 
 r
egions. According to the United Nations Conference on Avenues for South Asian and 
Global Integration36 | U NLEASHING  E-C OMMERCE  FOR  SOUTH  ASIAN  INTEGRATION
Trade and Development, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have specific consumer 
 pr
otection laws in the 
 r
egion. However, existing consumer protection 
 legislation 
does not account for the impersonal nature of online 
 tr
ansactions. 
In Bangladesh, the Consumer Rights Protection Act (2009) prevents any acts 
against consumer rights and interests in general, but not specifically for 
 e
-commerce. Although the provisions of the act also apply to the telecommuni-
cations and e-commerce sector, these mainly deal with product 
 safety
. The obli-
gations of economic operators, by contrast, address the production of goods and services and set out comprehensive procedures for ensuring product quality and safety and repressing 
 fr
aud. Other countries in the region lack provisions regard-
ing online consumer 
 pr
otection.
Some big-brand e-commerce firms in the region fill the regulatory gap by 
adopting their own conduct codes for ensuring consumer

forward a refund-only model, knowing that many of its sellers (mostly small 
Sri Lankan retailers approaching the online world for the first time) would not have sufficient 
 capacity to efficiently deal with high v
olumes of returns during 
peak sales 
 times
. 
E-commerce has created strong reputational incentives for firms to 
improve the quality of their 
 offerings
. For example, online portals (such as 
Amazon, e-Bay, Flipkart, Ola, and Uber) have a robust reputational feedback mechanism, such as product rating and review systems, that allows consum-ers a more powerful voice in economic 
 tr
ansactions. Likewise, many “expert” 
product review sites deepen the dependence of large firms on feedback mechanisms that confirm their reputation on an ongoing basis and establish trust between buyers and sellers in digital 
 space
. Consumers reviewing infor -
mation modify their buying decisions accordingly, which imposes costs on those sellers that miss the 
 benchmark. F
or example, to retain their reputa-
tion, some firms, such as Takas (a Sri Lankan online marketplace), run func -
tionality checks on each mobile phone sold on their website, while India Mart, a business-to-business (B2B) platform, takes complaints about suppli-ers listed on their online platform very seriously, to the extent of excluding them in certain cases when they are not responsive in resolving the issue 
 r
aised. In comparison, the smaller firms in Sri Lanka and Nepal do not offer 
an appropriate return policy, perhaps because of a lack of competition and because there is lower brand equity at 
 s
take. 
The reputational mechanism of digital platforms could potentially replace 
the role of the regulator in protecting consumers’ 
 rights
. The reputational incen-
tives motivate firms constantly to seek ways to improve the quality of their 
 offerings
. In addition, online transactions empower consumers through other 
means as 
 w
ell. For example, monitoring mechanisms in Uber and Ola allow con-
sumers to track their rides and share their reviews in real time with friends and 
 family
. As a result of these checks and balances, bad actors get weeded out fairly 
quickly through better information, reputational incentives, and aggressive community 
 self
-policing. This provides incentives to motivate online firms to 
protect consumers even without formal 
 legislation.
The cr
eation of regional online retail platforms, therefore, could present an 
opportunity for better integrating South 
 Asia. T
o the extent that consumer 
 p
rotection regulation is based on inadequate information for consumers, the 
presence of regional and international brand-name online platforms can soften the case for government 
 i
ntervention. These entities could leverage the geo -
graphic and cultural proximity of the countries in the region, a potential oppor -
tunity for achieving economies of 
 scale
. At the same time, firms that are sensitive 
to their reputation could facilitate transactions across national borders by acting as credible guarantors of consumer rights across 
 bor
ders. The rationale for self-  
r
egulation and business ethics adopted by online firms at the national level 
would apply even more when these firms are faced with the challenge of cater -
ing to a larger pool of 
 cus
tomers. Exposure to more customers arising from 
regional exposure may incentivize online firms to provide better protection of the interests of consumers, including cross-border 
 consumers
. It is possible that, 
as online digital platforms alleviate the need for regulation, consumer welfare may ultimately be better protected by loosening traditional 
 r
egulations. 
Increased competition, innovation, and better information obviate the need for heavy-handed 
 
regulation. 38 | U NLEASHING  E-C OMMERCE  FOR  SOUTH  ASIAN  INTEGRATION
E-COMMERCE CONTRACTS: FACILITATING DIGITAL 
SIGNATURES AND PROTECTING CONSUMER DATA
Most countries in South Asia have some form of regulation governing 
 e
-
 tr
ansactions and 
 e
-signatures. The regulations accord legal status to all elec -
tronic records and other activities carried out by electronic 
 means
. Electronic 
means of communication, for example, may be used to express an acceptance of 
contract, which has in turn the same legal validity and enforceability as if it were 
 paper
-based. Subscribers may then authenticate electronic records by affixing 
their digital 
 signatur
e. Furthermore, the laws promote e-government services 
and electronic communications and transactions between public and private bodies and ensure that the general principles of e-transactions are applicable also to the public sector, e-governance, and business-to-government (B2G) 
 applications
. The various national laws all envisage the establishment of a con-
troller to supervise the activities of the certifying authorities and specify various forms and content of digital signature 
 certificates
. The acts generally acknowl-
edge the need for recognizing foreign certifying authorities and conforming to international 
 
standards.
In theory, in all the region’s countries except Bhutan and Nepal, the e-trans-
action regulations conform to the principles of technological neutrality and functional 
 equiv
alence. However, the application of these principles in practice 
is a subject for 
 debate
. India’s encryption laws, for example, require firms to 
comply with low-standard encryption to secure digitally transmitted informa-tion and procure a license should they decide to use more sophisticated and secure 
 cryptogr
aphy. Moreover, India’s Information Technology Act 2000 rec -
ognizes e-transactions but primarily covers business or commercial transac -
tions; it has no specific provision for electronic commerce for online shopping, online 
 banking
, or money transfer 
 activities
. However, several other regulations 
and guidelines monitor 
 these
. For example, the Payment and Settlement Systems 
Act 2007 , which was set up by the Reserve Bank of India, provides regulation and supervision of payment systems in 
 India.
Although 
laws exist, their practical enactment is hindered by the lack of clar -
ity and institutional  gaps
. For example, in Bangladesh, although the Information 
Communication Technology Act 2006 introduces the registration and recogni-tion of digital signatures, there is much ambiguity in the terminology of elec -
tronic and digital signatures, and therefore, it is not clear what kind of signature the act 
 r
ecognizes. In other countries, such as Nepal, another major obstacle is 
institutional gaps; although e-transactions and digital signatures are part of the policy mandated by Nepal’s government, the law has not been implemented properly so far, mostly because there seems to be no agency to authorize the acceptance of digital 
 signatur
es. 
Although several South Asian countries have some form of data privacy reg -
ulations, they are inadequate by international 
 s
tandards. For example, 
Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Pakistan have basic framework 
 
regulations1 defining broad principles on data privacy requirements for entities 
that collect, process, and store personal  data. 
Although Sri Lanka aspires to cre -
ate safe practices for data protection, the country has no special provisions to protect data privacy and does not provide adequate mechanisms to remedy any misuse of information about consumers who make online 
 pur
chases. However, 
even existing regulations look far from complete and are often characterized by significant and substantial implementation 
 gaps
. Nepal’s Right to Information Avenues for South Asian and Global Integration | 39
Act, for instance, has features expected from data privacy laws,2 but the act is not 
applicable to the private  sector
. Nepalese citizens have a right of access to their 
personal information from a wide range of government and nongovernmental 
bodies, but do not enjoy the same rights in their interactions with the private 
 sector
. In Pakistan, the data protection law does not apply to certain public agen-
cies; it regulates the processing of personal or corporate data carried out by the federal, provincial, or local 
 go
vernment. The federal government may exempt 
any public or private sector entity or business from operation of the act with respect to local electronic 
 data.
Similarly
, there is not full compliance with the provisions on data in India’s 
Information Technology 
 A
ct. The Information Technology Act rules incorpo -
rate, to a limited extent, the principles of collection limitation, purpose specifi-cation, use limitation, and individual 
 p
articipation. The rules also mandate 
certain requirements for the collection of information and require that it be done only for a lawful purpose connected with the function of the 
 or
ganization. 
However, the rules apply only to corporate entities, leaving the government and government bodies outside its 
 ambit. And the rules ar
e restricted to “sensitive 
personal data,” which include attributes like sexual orientation, medical records, and biometrics but are silent on the larger category of personal data (Government of India 2017).
3 Furthermore, the Cyber Appellate Tribunal, a critical resolution 
authority on data privacy issues, appears not to have delivered any decisions, heard any new matters, or appointed a chairperson since June 2011. On the more positive side, the newly introduced Indian Consumer Protection Bill, 2019, fea-tures the disclosure of personal information given in confidence (unless required by law or in the public interest) as an unfair trade practice sanctionable with 
 
penalties.
In July 2018, the Justice Sri Krishna Committee of Experts submitted a draft 
Indian Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018, for consideration to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology for introduction in 
 P
arliament. The bill 
establishes requirements for the collection and processing of personal data, with significant restrictions applying to the processing of sensitive personal 
 data.
 
Moreover, the bill requires organizations to appoint a data protection officer and implement information security safeguards, including encryption and safe -
guards against misuse, unauthorized access to, modification of, disclosure, or destruction of personal 
 data. The bill, which also pr
oposes amendments to the 
Right to Information Act and Information Technology Act, applies horizontally to the government and the private sector and has an extraterritorial application to any entities providing goods and services in India and any activity involving the profiling of persons in 
 India.
B
y comparison, regulations on cross-border data flows are highly 
 s
tringent. 
In Nepal, free access to information from public agencies is restricted to Nepalese citizens and is further limited by the provision that requesters must state a rea-son for their information 
 r
equest. According to India’s Information Technology 
Act, a corporation can transfer sensitive personal data to firms outside India only if the same level of data protection is guaranteed as that mandated under Indian 
 rules
. Such data transfers often would occur between and among units of the 
same corporate enterprise that is located in different countries, which thus must comply with many different regulations and heterogeneous 
 s
tandards. India’s 
draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018, allows cross-border data transfer through a variety of 
 channels
. Nonetheless, the bill rejects consent alone as suf -
ficient for transfer and requires the receiving country to have a sufficiently high 40 | U NLEASHING  E-C OMMERCE  FOR  SOUTH  ASIAN  INTEGRATION
level of data protection in place for  tr ansfers. However, the criteria for deeming 
the level of protection appropriate in a foreign country are left partly unspeci-
fied, as the bill generally appeals to “applicable laws and international agree -
ments” and the effectiveness of enforcement by “authorities with the applicable 
 
jurisdiction.”4
Establishing a mechanism for mutually recognizing e-transactions could 
help enhance cross-border 
 e
-commerce. For instance, the European 
Commission’s 2014 e-IDs regulation ensures that people and businesses can 
use their own national electronic identification methods (e-IDs) to access public services in other European Union (EU) countries where e-IDs are 
 a
vailable. This helped create an internal market for e-signatures and related 
online services across borders, by ensuring these services work across bor -
ders and have the same legal status as traditional, paper-based 
 pr
ocesses. 
Such harmonization and recognition of national e-IDs also help enhance sav -
ings from 
 e
-procurement.5 If a more ambitious goal is to homogenize national 
legislation and set up an effective common regulatory framework across countries in the region, an obvious first step would be to set up a system for recognizing the validity of each other’s e-signatures, subject to agreed-on minimum technical 
 s
tandards. In practice, this would entail allowing techno -
logical neutrality for signatures coming from South Asian countries and not defining any explicit prescriptions of particular types of technology or spe -
cific public key infrastructure that would be considered valid in the issuance of digital signatures and the respective 
 certificates
.
As in the European Union, a single digital market would necessitate the 
 harmonization of r
egulations governing data 
 flo
ws. Although such regulations 
are much needed for stimulating cross-border e-commerce, any new or updated legislation should be implemented with caution and not cause unreasonable costs or administrative burdens to online 
 r
etailers. To keep the digital transac -
tions competitive, legislation should also recognize the economic potential of recent technical developments in information collection and analysis—such as profiling, data-driven marketing, and the use of cookies—which stimulate busi-ness innovation and provide opportunities for online retailers to optimize per -
sonalization and tailor their businesses to new consumer 
 demands
.6 The 
resulting unified framework for regional data privacy should also be set up in a way that ensures nondiscrimination of regional citizens on the basis of national-ity of 
 origin. 
For instance, Indian laws should afford the same level of data pro -
tection to a Sri Lankan consumer of an Indian company as to an Indian customer of the same 
 firm.
 
CONSOLIDATING E-PAYMENTS: REGULATORY 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND CYBERSECURITY
Payment systems consist of infrastructure providers and system  oper ators. 
Payment system providers (PSPs) provide the hardware, software, and network 
infrastructure necessary for the operation of a payment system and use payment systems to provide various financial products and services, including money transfers and 
 pa
yments. The operation of the system, including the regulation of 
access and protocols for transactions, is the prerogative of payment system 
 o
perators. However, there is much heterogeneity across countries on the func -
tion and form of PSPs and payment system 
 oper
ators. Avenues for South Asian and Global Integration | 41
Regulatory structures governing payment systems vary substantially across 
countries and are often cumbersome and lack 
 clarity
. In Sri Lanka, for example, 
a restrictive environment for online payments stifles the growth of 
 e
-commerce. 
In particular, somewhat dated laws have held back innovation and growth in this 
area (Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and EIU 2017). Despite a reasonable level of development and sophistication of the banking system, imperfect competition in the banking sector seems to be a source of 
 inefficiencies
. For example, banks 
do not allow online payments to be performed with a debit card and only accept credit card 
 p
ayments. Moreover, the infrastructure for payment services is by 
law required to be located within a bank, which makes it difficult for nonbank PSPs to operate in the 
 mark
et.
Sri Lankan laws limit the types of companies that are eligible to provide 
financial services on e-commerce 
 platforms
. Specifically, the Payment Cards 
and Mobile Payment Systems Regulations 
 N
o. 1 of 2013 prohibits any entity 
to engage in the business of or function as a service provider except under the authority and in accordance with the terms and conditions of a license issued by the Central 
 B
ank. This has resulted in limited options for transacting 
 online
. Another issue raised by many Sri Lankan private entities is the restric -
tions on internationally recognized payment systems, such as PayPal—these payment systems are allowed for making, but not for receiving, international 
 pa
yments. Some national companies are starting to fill this gap by devising 
new technologies, for example PayHere, which offers an integrated payment solution that would allow vendors to accept payments through multiple 
 channels
. However, banking regulations and a stringent licensing system for 
PSPs are posing significant barriers to 
 inno
vation. For example, there are 
stringent requirements on the types of institutions that are eligible for receiv -
ing such licenses7 or an unimpaired capital of at least SL Rs 150 million—
which limit the opportunities for providing online payment services to banks, telecommunication companies, or large corporates with a significant amount of 
 
capital.
PSPs in India consist of bank and nonbank  pla
yers.8 As of July 2016, the PSP 
segment in India had eight authorized payment banks and 44 authorized pre -
paid payment instruments (including mobile wallets and prepaid cards) (Watal 2016). The Reserve Bank of India has also authorized eight cross-border money transfer operators and eight white-label automated teller machine 
 o
perators. 
However, a report by Watal (2016) on digital payments in India notes that the payments ecosystem in India is largely bank-centric, with most payment systems being operated by the Reserve Bank of India or a consortium of major 
 b
anks. 
Moreover, only bank-led PSPs have direct access to payment systems, while non-bank PSPs can access payment systems only through a member 
 bank
. 
Furthermore, the report highlights how the present regulatory framework fails to classify the players participating in the payments market, which creates con-fusion among market participants in determining what piece of regulation applies to 
 them.
In B
angladesh, too, the slow pace of liberalization and banking practices seem 
to be holding back 
 change
. For example, e-retailers are not keen on accepting 
even national payments through cards because of a 3–4 percent commission to banks, relative to the cash-on-delivery 
 model. M
oreover, although Bangladesh 
Bank has introduced the two-factor authentication system, in practice most of the banks do not allow cardholders to do Internet transactions unless they call the bank to open the Internet for a specific 
 dur
ation. 42 | U NLEASHING  E-C OMMERCE  FOR  SOUTH  ASIAN  INTEGRATION
In Pakistan, recent reform is seeking to fill existing regulatory gaps by design-
ing a comprehensive framework for e-commerce 
 policy
. Although the resulting 
legislation has not yet been finalized by the Parliament, the current draft is sup -
posed to include specific provisions for e-transactions and 
 e
-contracts. Moreover, 
the reform foresees amendments in the foreign exchange regulations of the State 
Bank of Pakistan to facilitate cross-border electronic payments, together with the finalization of a national payment gateway for international 
 tr
ansactions.
Conversely, the lack of a solid institutional framework weakens online trans-
actions in 
 N
epal. Approximately 85 percent of e-commerce users in Nepal prefer 
cash on delivery as their payment 
 me
thod. Digital payment gateways, such as 
eSewa and IME Pay, account for only 13 percent of the users, while debit card transactions are availed by only 2 percent of users (UNCTAD 2017
 b). The lack of
 
informed regulations and policies makes e-payments an extremely difficult 
 option. E
-commerce websites usually must be based outside the country, where 
credit card verification services are 
 a
vailable. However, credit card transfers and 
transfers from e-banking websites are accepted only from Nepalis who have an international debit or credit card, which is highly 
 r
estricted. Furthermore, for -
eign exchange is regulated and not freely available in the 
 country
.9 The need for 
PSPs to collaborate with operators (banks) creates prohibitive fees for mer -
chants, while there have also been barriers for PayPal to enter the Nepalese 
 
market. 
Although digital wallets represent efficient alternatives in Nepal, the licens-
ing procedure is extremely costly and time 
 consuming
. Nepal Rashtra Bank, the 
central bank, has formalized the licensing of more financial service providers and PSPs, allowing them to offer e-payment services to the 
 public. In A
ugust 
2016, when Nepal Rashtra Bank opened the PSP licensing application system, more than 67 firms applied for the licenses, but as of June 2017 , Nepal Rashtra Bank had issued licenses to only three firms: eSewa, IME Pay, and Prabhu Technology (UNCTAD 2017
 a). Other domes
tic players are finding it extremely 
difficult to enter the market because of strict policies on the classification as PSP or payment system operator, especially capital 
 r
equirements.
Nepal has proposed a strategic plan to reform its national payments system, 
but the institutional arrangements are far from 
 perfect. Although ther
e are plans 
for the creation of a single, unified payment gateway, this has not yet happened, and sellers face various hurdles in processing their 
 tr
ansactions. This situation is 
aggravated by the lack of a single authority dealing with e-commerce 
 matters
. 
The lack of clear regulations and a multiplicity of institutions involved in the regulation of e-payment-related issues are serious hindrances in this 
 dir
ection. 
The payment gateway seems to be the domain, at any given time, of the Payments Department of Nepal Rashtra Bank, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Technology, the Foreign Department of Nepal Rashtra Bank, and various other groups and 
 committees
. In particular, business-related aspects of e-commerce 
are coordinated by other ministries; for example, industries are handled by the Ministry of Industry, trade is dealt with by the Ministry of Commerce, and tech-nology falls under the purview of the Ministry of Science, Technology, and 
 
Environment.
Regulatory barriers on foreign capital and currency flows inhibit online pay -
ments in 
 N
epal. For example, sellers cannot receive payments in 
 U
.S. dollars, 
which usually results in additional cost to the firms, as they need to maintain a subsidiary abroad to receive the 
 pa
yment. The repatriation of the received pay -
ments is subject to high 
 tax. These contr
ols hinder cross-border online 
 e
xports. Avenues for South Asian and Global Integration | 43
Moreover, because foreign exchange is regulated and foreign currency is unavail-
able, Nepalese consumers cannot purchase goods online on foreign sites, as for -
eign sellers cannot receive 
 pa
yment. Therefore, Nepal only has domestic 
e-commerce retailers, given the curbs on cross-border 
 tr
ansactions. 
These hurdles significantly constrain formal cross-border 
 e
-commerce. 
Although no estimates of formal e-commerce trade between India and the rest of South Asia are available, data on cross-border movement of low-value individ-ual shipments provide some 
 idea. The v
olume of and average values for bilateral 
small shipments between India and Bangladesh (the largest in the region) are provided in table 4.2. Assuming that around 50 percent of all of the low-value, small shipments in table 4.2 are business-to-consumer (B2C), and the rest are B2B, the value of formal, cross-border B2C e-commerce between India and Bangladesh should be between US$4 million and US$10 million per 
 y
ear. Of 
course, this is an underestimate, because it includes only DHL shipments; it does not include shipments done through other couriers or the postal department and it does not include informal 
 e
-commerce.
Despite the weak formal e-commerce linkages between India, on the one 
hand, and Nepal and Bangladesh, on the other, informal, cross-border 
 e
-commerce between these countries is 
 thriving
. Such informal linkages are 
 primarily enabled b
y the cross-border movement of people across these two 
 bor
ders, through the presence of Nepali and Bangladeshi migrant workers in 
 
India.10 Large numbers of people also travel across borders for health care, 
 education, tourism (including r
eligious tourism), and 
 business
. 
The cross-border movement of people allows Bangladeshis and Nepalese 
visiting India to order online from Indian e-commerce platforms and to carry the products back with them to their home 
 countries
. In many cases, networks 
of families and friends browse Indian websites and instruct a member of their social circle visiting India to make the 
 pur
chase. Informal agents, such as small 
retail shops located close to the border (in cities like Kolkata and Malda in West Bengal) often make an online purchase on behalf of Nepalese and Bangladeshi citizens for a small fee and hold the item in their shop until the buyers pick it 
 up
. 
Regulatory frameworks can facilitate a larger role for the private sector to 
offer innovative cross-border payment solutions for the 
 r
egion. Paytm, for 
example, is an Indian electronic payment and e-commerce online 
 platform. The
 
company operates an online mall, which differs from a standard online market -
place in that sellers can open their “shop” on the Paytm website rather than just posting their products 
 online
. The company also has a license as a payment bank 
in India and operates its own payment gateway and digital 
 w
allet. These pay -
ment systems enable users to pay for purchases on Paytm and other websites,

. Such a simplified approach to completing transactions results 
in better usability and ultimately more utility for 
 cus
tomers. Clearly, cross-bor -
der payments will need the cooperation of authorities on either side of national 
 bor
ders. Nonetheless, if platforms like Paytm were allowed to operate across 
borders, they could facilitate the process, providing an efficient solution to a 
complex administrative 
 pr
oblem.
Laws pertaining to cybersecurity exist in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, 
Pakistan, and Sri 
 Lank
a.11 These laws aim to prevent unauthorized acts with 
respect to information systems and to provide for related offenses as well as mechanisms for their investigation, prosecution, trial, and international 
 cooper
ation. Some of the main issues in cybersecurity regulation relate to crimes 
against information and data systems, including the unauthorized access, trans-mission, copying, or interference in an information system or data; computer viruses; or otherwise tampering with computer source 
 code
. The laws most 
often establish the prohibition of unsolicited e-mails (spam), obscene or wrong -
ful communication, and use of a false license or 
 certificate
. Moreover, various 
personal crimes via the Internet are also generally included, such as personal security and security of payment, communications with children, online harass-ment, and criminal defamation through any information 
 s
ystem. Pakistan’s 
Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (2016) also includes cyberterrorism, glori-fication of terrorism-related acts, hate speech, and recruitment or funding and planning of 
 terr
orism. 
Cybercrime laws feature a range of content control measures as 
 w
ell. For 
example, India’s Information Technology Rules provide that the central govern-ment can direct agencies to block access to information, when necessary or expedient, in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity, defense, and security of the country, public order, and friendly relations with foreign 
 s
tates. Indian 
courts have the authority to issue orders to block or filter Internet content with-out central government 
 appr
oval. Similar provisions can be found in Bangladeshi 
and Nepalese 
 r
egulations. Pakistan also introduced other instances of content 
control, such as banning online protest websites and online gambling, and the proscription of unacceptable foreign broadcasting services or prohibited 
 films
. 
The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority also has the power to remove or block access to information on the basis of religious 
 consider
ations.
Although most countries have clear prescriptions on cybersecurity, it is not 
obvious that they are implemented in 
 pr
actice. For example, the Nepalese cyber -
crime laws12 provide for a tribunal dealing with cybercrimes, but private players 
lament that the laws have never been fully implemented and that the tribunal has not been instituted 
 y
et. In particular, UNCTAD (2017b) emphasizes that the 
law is outdated with respect to the new and continuously evolving technology in this 
 space
. In addition, its impact has not been as expected because of a lack of 
proper monitoring and the capacity to monitor its 
 use
. As a result, cybercrimes 
are on the rise in Nepal, with the police reporting 39 cases in 2015, a 105 percent increase from 2014 (UNCTAD 2017
 b). N
onetheless, for some firms, the mere 
existence of regulation seems to make a  differ
ence. The Nepalese online market -
place Muncha, for instance, reported that the simple introduction of those imperfect cybercrime laws coincided with a significant decline in the instances of hacking of its 
 w
ebsite. 
At a regional level, cybersecurity hinges on national cybercrime laws being 
properly 
 implemented. Ther
e should be a growing awareness among countries Avenues for South Asian and Global Integration | 45
to take the security threats arising from e-commerce  seriously . Creating and pro -
tecting trust, and ensuring the safety and security of electronic transactions, is a 
key issue for the establishment of a functioning e-commerce 
 fr
amework. After 
strengthening national capacity, then, a regional strategy could envisage inte -
grated cybersecurity 
 solutions
. Particular emphasis could be given to the harmo -
nization of domestic criminal laws in terms of offenses and connected provisions in the area of cybercrime, as well as the setting up of a fast and effective system of international 
 cooper
ation.
These policies would have the greatest impact if they were designed in com-
pliance with international cybersecurity best 
 pr
actices. In this respect, interna-
tional cooperation against crimes that by their own nature transcend national or regional borders would be most 
 critical. 
The main international benchmark for 
cybersecurity is the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime of the Council of Europe (2001), whose main objective is to pursue a common criminal policy against 
 cyber
crime. It requires states to criminalize, in their domestic legislation, 
a number of malicious conducts, and to establish domestic criminal procedural law powers for the investigation and prosecution of crimes committed via the Internet and computer 
 netw
orks.

of South Asian countries in 2018 was a very low 2.51, compared with 3.15 for East Asia and Pacific, and 2.78 for Middle East and North 
 Africa. Afghanis
tan, with a 
score of 2.04, reflected one of the poorest logistics performances in the 
 w
orld. In 
recent years, India has emphasized logistics among its high-priority economic reforms, and in 2017 it created a new logistics division in the Ministry of Commerce and 
 Indus
try. Its Logistics Performance Index score in 2018 was 3.18, 
placing it among the top performers in lower-middle-income countries (World Bank 2018
 b). The o
verall state of logistics in South Asia presents a challenge for 
the development of e-commerce, but also presents an opportunity for rapid progress, given the logistics-related innovations that e-commerce has 
 enabled.
Deliv
ery and distribution channels related to e-commerce come in different 
business 
 models
. Cross-border e-commerce can take place through the fulfill-
ment model or direct 
 selling
. The fulfillment model is typically used for products 
(and brands) that have a high and predictable volume of regular sales in a partic -
ular  mark
et. E-commerce platforms or merchants trading on them would typi-
cally ship container loads of such products using low-cost ocean freight (or, in certain cases, relatively low-cost regular air freight) and store them in ware -
houses after customs clearance in the receiving 
 country
. When individual orders 
are placed online, these orders are fulfilled by delivering to the customer from these 
 w
arehouses. In many respects, then, cross-border e-commerce using the 
fulfillment model is indistinguishable from domestic 
 e
-commerce. Such goods 
are listed alongside domestically sourced products in e-commerce portals and are stored in the same 
 w
arehouse. Payment is made in local currency, and the 
last-mile logistics between the warehouse and the consumer follow the same 
 
channels. 
Direct selling is more typical for goods that have a higher value or have inter -
mittent demand and relatively lower  v
olumes. The markets for such products 46 | U NLEASHING  E-C OMMERCE  FOR  SOUTH  ASIAN  INTEGRATION
are typically far less predictable, and businesses usually do not hold stocks of 
such products in the consumer 
 mark
et. This means that these products are 
directly purchased from international sellers, and then each individual product purchased online is sent to the consumer using international express (courier) or postal channels of 
 dis
tribution. 
Although express and postal shipping are substantially more expensive than 
general ocean or air cargo, they are essential to such individualized 
 shipping
. 
First, online consumers expect delivery within a certain span of time, which is difficult using ocean freight or regular air 
 car
go. Second, freight forwarders typ -
ically work with large volumes and individual, small shipments are generally not of interest to their 
 oper
ations. Third, consumers expect some form of tracking of 
their purchases in transit, which is much easier in the courier and postal 
 ecosys
tem. Finally, express and postal operations are better designed to handle 
door-to-door  
delivery.
Postal and courier shipments face impediments to e-commerce delivery in 
South 
 Asia. The pos
tal letter parcel and express mail service (the expedited mail 
delivery managed by postal operators) in South Asia have several operational shortcomings that make them less attractive to e-commerce 
 pla
yers. The lack of 
proper postal addressing systems in South Asia has made last-mile delivery a serious challenge for e-commerce companies, thus making them more depen-dent on more informal delivery mechanisms between delivery facilities and con-sumers’ 
 homes
. In the context of exports from South Asian countries, constraints 
include the inability of postal operators to provide at-premise pickup of out -
bound 
 shipments
. Exporters must travel to the nearest post office, book their 
shipments, and drop off their goods 
 ther
e. And South Asian postal operators are 
perceived to be less reliable in the handling and security of 
 goods
. For imports, 
South Asian postal operators have struggled to keep pace with rapidly increasing volumes and to manage the related customs 
 pr
ocesses. Although there have been 
some recent developments in India Post to enhance end-to-end tracking and tracing facilities, other South Asian postal operators have to date been slower in offering full, end-to-end track and trace 
 options
. 
Customs agencies have also 
 s
truggled. Customs agencies across much of Asia 
struggle to cope with congestion and valuation issues arising from increasing cross-border parcel flows (UNESCAP and ADB 2018).
Foreign direct investment (FDI) in logistics services is generally open in most 
countries in the 
 r
egion. FDI in various aspects of logistics can improve the effi-
ciency of parcel 
 deliv
ery. In South Asia, data for India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and 
Sri Lanka show minimal restrictions on FDI in segments relevant to small parcel 
 deliv
ery. However, in freight forwarding, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh cap FDI at 
40 percent (table 4.3). 
South Asia faces several important challenges with international express 
 clear
ances. For imports, none of the countries in the region seems to have clearly 
defined de minimis thresholds; Indian regulations provide for a low-value non-dutiable category, limited to gifts and samples up to a certain value (table 4.4). 
A low-value, dutiable category that would benefit from simplified customs 
clearance is not available in several 
 countries
. The value of such an option lies in 
simplified and expedited clearance, even more than the low duty 
 itself
. The sim-
plified clearance system is not operative in Bangladesh and 
 Bhutan. Wher
e it is 
operative, its thresholds vary from US$200 in Nepal to US$1,500 in India (table 4.5). Overall, the lack of a simplified option or a low-value threshold reduces the percentage of shipments that can avail simplified and expedited Avenues for South Asian and Global Integration | 47

 A mor
e recent source of controversy in India relates to the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of 
Financial and other Subsidies, Benefits, and Services) Act (2016), which enables the gov -
ernment to collect identity information from citizens including their biometrics, issue a unique identification number on the basis of such information, and provide targeted deliv -
ery of subsidies, benefits, and services to 
 them. In 2018
, India’s Supreme Court delivered a 
far-reaching judgment on several petitions related to the growing use of 
 Aadhar
. It recog -
nized the constitutional validity of 
 Aadhar
. It asked the government to bring in a law for 
data 
 pr
otection. It agreed that the government can mandate its use to distribute govern-
ment subsidies and benefits and can be required to be linked to India’s tax ID 
 n
umber. 
However, the court instructed that Aadhaar could not be required for opening bank accounts or getting mobile 
 connections
. And private companies cannot ask for Aadhaar as 
a condition for providing services (see Gelb, Mukherjee, and Navis 2018).

. Ther
e are also issues related to data localization 
 r
equirements. For example, the White 
Paper on Data Protection in India (Government of India 2017) notes how localization requirements are hurting Indian startups that could rely on the cloud to host their busi-nesses rather than having to make an expensive capital investment in computer 
 har
dware. 
India’s draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018, confirms the data localization provisions introduced by previous 
 legislation. Globally
, China and India are in favor of data localiza-
tion, and several other countries—including Australia, Brazil, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, and Vietnam—have introduced localization 
 la
ws. Japan and the United 
States are opposed to 
 localization.

REGIONAL MARKET FOR E-TRANSPORT
Transport represents a fascinating application of e-commerce in  se rvices. The 
regulatory landscape for transportation has significant impacts on the online 
mediation of transport services as a form of e-commerce and on the consump -
tion of goods transacted 
 online
.
Transport services, especially for intra-urban mobility, have emerged as one 
of the global success stories of  e
-commerce. Uber-like transport aggregators, 
supported by app-based transaction management, have become commonplace in many parts of the world, and the model has now spread to other areas of transportation and distribution services, such as freight forwarding (booking containers), trucking, and shared 
 w
arehousing. 
The distribution and delivery of goods bought online depend crucially on 
transportation 
 services
. E-commerce has become one of the most intensive 
users of logistics and transport services, given the need to deliver millions of small packages meant for individual consumption to the doors of 
 consumers
. 
In effect, the private act of transportation undertaken by the consumer between the physical store and home to acquire a product has been replaced by a service provided by the 
 seller
. When moving goods, air 
 tr
ansportation is 
the preferred mode for intercity and international 
 shipments
. However, 
every e-commerce delivery also involves extensive road transportation for the goods to reach the consumer’s 
 door
. In this context, China’s JD.com 
offers an interesting case study of an e-commerce company focusing not only on selling 
 pr
oducts but also equally on logistics—“a combination of Amazon 
and 
 
UPS.”1
In South Asia, e-commerce faces challenging transport-related  cons traints. 
A critical hurdle for air cargo in general—and for small, individual shipments typical of “direct selling” e-commerce in particular—is the lack of adequate han-dling and processing infrastructure in smaller regional 
 airports
. This issue is 
acute in a vast country such as 
 India. M
ore than 90 percent of the country’s air 
cargo shipments are handled in six main airports (Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Kolkata, and Hyderabad), which poses significant challenges for large parts of the country located at some distance from a major air 
 hub
. Large parts Policy Options52 | U NLEASHING  E-C OMMERCE  FOR  SOUTH  ASIAN  INTEGRATION
of north, central, northeastern, and southeastern India, like the more remote 
parts of Odisha and Andhra Pradesh, are more than 400 kilometers from a major airport with adequate processing and handling 
 infr
astructure.
Bangladesh and Nepal are even more constrained by the lack of air cargo 
infrastructure and 
 connectivity
. Large parts of Bangladesh that are not in the 
proximity of Dhaka or Chittagong are difficult to serve logistically for any air cargo solution, especially given the country’s relatively poor road 
 infr
astructure. 
Nepal’s mountainous terrain makes for severe logistical impediments to any road-based solution, while Kathmandu remains the sole major air hub with any capability to process 
 car
go. 
In some cases, parts of Nepal and Bangladesh could potentially be served by 
Indian 
 airports
. For example, parts of western Bangladesh are close to Kolkata, 
and certain areas of Nepal could be accessible from Varanasi, which is emerging as a fast-growing regional airport with international air 
 connections
. However, 
regulatory restrictions related to customs and transport laws prevent effective cross-border trucking that would allow these parts of Bangladesh or Nepal to use Indian airports (or vice 
 v
ersa). 
The acute lack of logistics integration in the South Asian region is often coun-
tered by the sustained flows of informal cross-border 
 e
-commerce. This infor -
mal model could well become a robust and regular channel of trade if cheap transport options and customs-related facilitation were available for low-value products crossing regional 
 bor
ders. 
Developing such an integrated model in South Asia would require the coun-
tries to allow each other’s vehicles into their 
 territories
. Except for traffic 
between India and Nepal, at present trucks cannot cross borders; goods must be transloaded at the border, often manually (given the lack of mechanization and development of modern automated truck bays at customs 
 s
tations). The costs 
and delays associated with this process are 
 significant. M
oreover, in addition to 
trucks not being able to cross borders, South Asian countries do not allow semi-trailers and trailers to cross borders, in contrast to what happens in other parts of the world, such as Europe, large parts of the Middle East, North and East Africa, and North 
 America.
 
The Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal Motor Vehicles Agreement (BBIN 
MVA), originally signed in 2015, provides a promising framework for addressing this 
 issue
. The agreement allows vehicles from member states to enter each 
 other
’s territory for the transportation of cargo and 
 passengers
. It also abolishes 
cross-border transloading of goods for cargo vehicles, which would be tracked electronically and receive the relevant permits 
 online
. Bhutan subsequently 
indicated that it would prefer to wait, so the agreement has effectively become the Bangladesh, India, and Nepal (BIN) 
 MV
A. 
Despite the good starting point offered by BIN MVA, some details need to 
be addressed to ensure maximum effectiveness of the 
 agr
eement. In particu-
lar, the agreement needs to address several critical areas related to the man-agement of cross-border transport and associated customs clearance procedures (Banerjee 2016). 
For example, trucks, trailers, and semitrailers should be allowed to cross 
 bor
ders with minimum restrictions, through simplifying customs and clearance 
procedures that have typically led to border 
 conges
tion. Off-border clearances 
could instead be put in place, allowing customs and other processes to take place at notified customs points inside the country, closer to where the consignor and consignee are 
 located. 
Using GPS technology and passive radio-frequency Policy Options | 53
identification technology seals, customs at the border can ensure that the goods 
in a vehicle have not been tampered with after having been checked and sealed by customs inside the 
 country
. 
Furthermore, customs rules should be made flexible enough to allow even 
small traders and small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) to benefit from the MVA. This would mean allowing multiconsignment goods (that is, sev-eral different shipments for different commercially registered entities) to be carried in the same truck or conveyance, allowing the development of freight networks and the less-than-a-truckload services typically preferred by 
 SMEs
. 
Moreover, SMEs would benefit if the clearance of low-value, small shipments was allowed at land customs 
 s
tations. India is the only country that has a 
provision along these lines in its customs rules, but limits it to just two loca-tions on the India-Bangladesh 
 bor
der. A more effective approach would be to 
allow inland clearances of low-value, small shipments, including for ship -
ments where the recipient is an individual and not a registered legal 
 entity
. 
South Asia could envision significant developments in digitally enabled 
 
mobility. In particular, an emerging trend is to use app-based aggregator models 
in goods transport, expanding shared mobility to hybrid models of “goods and passengers” 
 tr
ansport. An example of this is the extension of the Uber model to 
goods transport, which entails linking individual truckers and trucking compa-nies to consumers through apps that also manage bookings, payments, and other value-added services, such as insurance and commercial and legal document preparation for 
 carriage
. Uber has launched Uber Freight,2 while another inter -
national example is Saloodo, an initiative of Deutsche Post DHL 
 Gr
oup.3
Passenger mobility can also be leveraged to enhance cargo  solutions . For 
example, small consignments can easily travel from urban distribution hubs to consumer centers in smaller towns and villages using the dense network of pas-senger buses that crisscross most parts of South 
 Asia. 
An extension of app-based 
e-commerce mediation could manage payment, pick up, and delivery online, facilitating many “last-mile” delivery hurdles and at the same time helping reduce road congestion and 
 tr
affic. 
Similarly, intracity distribution of goods could gain from hybrid goods-  
passenger combinations if app
-based aggregators were also allowed to carry 
cargo in the boot of their passenger 
 v
ehicles. With this model, it is possible that 
roughly 30,000 taxis with their boot space could replace between 1,000 and 1,500 trucks on the road (depending, among other things, on how many trips a car does compared with a truck), reducing traffic and pollution and bringing down the cost of urban distribution of 
 goods
. 
The rollout of such hybrid services is prevented by the regulations currently 
contained in the motor vehicle acts of South Asian 
 countries
. For example, the 
commercial transport of passengers in India is regulated by the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The act recognizes three distinct types of passenger transport 
 (contr
act carriage, stage carriage, and tourist vehicle), but these definitions in 
practice impose many regulatory inflexibilities that prevent the development of new models of passenger transportation empowered by information technol-ogy (IT) and 
 digitization. F
or example, contract carriage essentially defines the 
ecosystem of traditional taxi services and, as per the interpretation of the law, a vehicle that is registered to provide a contract carriage service cannot pick up or drop off passengers during a 
 journey
. Tourist vehicles are a special category 
of contract carriage, being licensed taxis that can operate across state borders, and as such, they also are not allowed to pick up or drop off passengers along 54 | U NLEASHING  E-C OMMERCE  FOR  SOUTH  ASIAN  INTEGRATION
their  journey . The right to pick up and drop off passengers is instead reserved 
for vehicles registered as stage carriage, which defines the ecosystem for 
 tr
aditional bus or shared mobility 
 services
. 
Because the Indian law requires a vehicle to be registered as contract carriage 
or stage carriage, but not both, these definitions do not allow the growth of 
hybrid passenger transport that would enable a vehicle to switch between point-to-point exclusive passenger mobility and longer-route shared mobility by pick -
ing up and dropping off passengers along the 
 w
ay. However, the new ecosystem 
of personal mobility based on e-commerce could easily manage and provide such flexible, hybrid models of mobility, in turn optimizing vehicle use and route 
 
viability. 
Another major restriction in the Indian law on commercial passenger trans-
port is that stage carriage vehicles need to carry more than six 
 passengers
. This 
means that smaller cars, which form the backbone of intracity taxi services, can-
not qualify for shared mobility 
 licenses
. Although the regulation originated from 
legitimate concerns about passenger safety and passenger rights, the ground reality in South Asian cities today has evolved, and such regulatory restrictions have come to represent a source of unintended 
 inefficiency
. As Kumar et 
 al.
 
(2016) point out, informal public transport in India already sees many vehicles plying passengers without requisite permits, providing contract carriage or stage carriage services in hybrid models, and various forms of shared 
 mobility
. For 
instance, it is not infrequent for school buses and private cars to offer point-to-point or shared riding services when they are not engaged in their primary 
 
activity. 
India’s Motor Vehicles Act requires any given legal person to be the owner 
of a vehicle or act as an agent for the  o
wner. As this provision does not account 
for vehicle aggregators, such as those that provide app-based shared mobility 
services like Uber, changes to the regulatory framework are being contem-plated to include the category of aggregator as an entity that “owns and 
 manages a w
eb-based software application, and by means of the application 
and communication device, enables a potential customer to connect with 
 persons pr
oviding a particular service under the brand name or trade name of 
the  
aggregator.” 
Another problematic definition in India’s Motor Vehicles Act 1988 is that of 
goods transport vehicles, which the law identifies as those that are adapted and constructed to carry 
 goods
. Importantly, goods refer to all materials carried by a 
vehicle other than living human persons, which means that vehicles registered as goods transport vehicles cannot carry 
 passengers
. Thus, the dual use of a vehi-
cle for the transport of goods and passengers, such as taxis carrying goods in the car boot, is legally not 
 allo
wed. Although app-based truck aggregators have been 
managing to operate as “agents,” as defined by the Motor Vehicles Act, and many passenger vehicles informally carry goods and vice versa, the hybrid model is formally absent in the Indian 
 r
egulation.
Furthermore, India’s Carriage by Road Act, 2007 , requires providers of regu-
lar cargo carriage services to have at least two commercial vehicles registered under their name and to have a net worth of at least INR 500,000 (US$7 ,000). Because most vehicle owners operating through app-based aggregator services own just one vehicle and often cannot count on significant net capital worth, this provision represents another stumbling block for the development of a modern transport framework that takes full advantage of the opportunities offered by digital 
 
solutions. Policy Options | 55
In sum, there is a distinct case for substantially reforming the domestic laws 
and regulations of South Asian countries, to formalize the existing broad range 
of e-commerce-based transport 
 services
. This would first and foremost establish 
clear rules of the game and grant adequate legal protection to service providers, operators, and consumers in national 
 ar
enas. Once this is done, a promising next 
step would be to gradually facilitate the cross-border market for such services in South Asia, for example, starting from the Bangladesh, India, and Nepal cluster, and capitalizing on the formal and informal links that already exist within the 
 r
egion. Historically, the transport hubs within the BBIN subregion have always 
seen thriving cross-border transit of goods and passengers, especially between India and Bangladesh and between India and Nepal, and they are increasingly witnessing growing exchanges between Nepal, Bhutan, and 
 B
angladesh. The 
BIN Motor Vehicles Agreement is expected to strengthen these ties, especially if certain crucial refinements of customs and clearance rules are introduced in the 
 agr
eement. For app-based, shared mobility solutions, once the various national 
regulations are updated to account for the de facto existence of hybrid models of commercial carriage of goods and passengers, the cross-border supply of these services could represent a further driver of increased efficiency, reduced road and customs congestion, and deeper regional integration (see figure 5.1). 
UNIFIED MARKET FOR B2C E-COMMERCE
Similar to the European Union’s Digital Single Market proposal, South Asia could aspire to have a regionally integrated business-to-consumer (B2C) 
 e
-commerce 
 mark
et. Although a digital single market is not yet a reality in the 
European Union, a sustained effort toward this goal will enable people and busi-nesses to trade with fewer 
 b
arriers. For now, online marketplaces in Europe FIGURE 5.1

are mainly domestic, with only 7 percent of SMEs selling  cr oss-border. It has 
been estimated that the digital single market could contribute €415 billion to 
the European economy, boosting jobs, growth, competition, investment, and innovation (European Commission 2015). Figure 5.2 illustrates how a unified market could be designed to overcome transaction costs and ensure the protec -
tion of the South Asian 
 consumer
. 
A digital South Asian market will require tariff reforms and harmonization of 
national regulations pertaining to 
 e
-commerce. The main regulatory effort will 
be represented by tariff reforms and the reconciliation of national regulations in the areas of electronic transactions, data privacy, consumer protection, and 
 cybersecurity
. The Digital Single Market strategy launched by the European 
Commission in 2015, as well as the electronic commerce chapter in the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) among 11 Pacific Rim countries, are prominent international examples, and are addressed in this chapter as useful reference 
 points
.
The success of integrated markets will require protection of the South Asian 
consumer by way of appropriate regulations on data privacy and 
 cybersecurity
. 
These efforts should create a unified and integrated framework to ensure effectiveness through cooperation across national 
 authorities
. The key princi-
ples sustaining this framework should be harmonization, waiver of intra-regional data localization requirements, and 
 nondiscrimination. Specifically
, 
(a) cybersecurity laws and data privacy laws should be harmonized among countries in the region, and opportunities for cooperating on major cybercrime issues should be pursued by national authorities; (b) data should be allowed to

move freely within the region in the same way as they would within the national 
borders of each participant country, and companies operating in one South Asian country should not be required to set up data-processing and storage facilities in other countries in the region to be allowed to operate there; and (c) the same level of protection should be granted and enforced for the per -
sonal data, sensitive information, and cybersecurity of all South Asian consum-ers, regardless of their country of 
 origin.
The e
-commerce chapter of the CPTPP Agreement mandates that each coun-
try must adopt or maintain consumer protection laws to proscribe fraudulent and deceptive commercial activities that are harmful to consumers engaged in online commercial activities (Article 14.7). The agreement stresses the impor -
tance of cooperation between the countries’ respective national consumer pro -
tection agencies or other relevant bodies regarding activities related to cross-border 
 e
-commerce. Article 14.11 also mandates partner countries to allow 
the cross-border transfer of data, including personal 
 information. Specifically
, 
national laws are allowed to restrict cross-border transfers only if they (a) are necessary “to achieve a legitimate public policy objective”; (b) are not applied “in a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable dis-crimination”; (c) are not a “disguised restriction on trade”; and (d) do not impose “restrictions on transfers of information greater than are required to achieve the 
 
objective.”
In the European Digital Single Market, European Union–wide enforcement 
of consumer rights works through a strong cooperation effort among national public 
 
authorities.4 A key piece of legislation to boost fairness in e-commerce 
transactions is the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive,5 which has been com-
plemented by a guidance note on its application to the online 
 sector
. In 2016, the 
European Commission proposed a reform of the Consumer Protection Cooperation Regulation
6 to ensure a more efficient cooperation framework 
among national authorities in fostering enforcement and stopping online 
 infringements
. The regulation aims to provide a single procedure, launched and 
coordinated by the European Commission, for European Union–wide 
 pr
oblems. 
The European Union–wide online dispute resolution platform helps consumers and traders solve disputes over online transactions (within and cross-border), without going to 
 court.
 
For cybersecurity, member states and European Union institutions abide by 
the European Cybersecurity Strategy (2013). The essential legislative compo -
nent of this strategy is the 2016 Directive on Security of Network and Information 
 
Systems.7 The European Commission’s Communication on “Strengthening 
Europe’s Cyber Resilience System and Fostering a Competitive and Innovative Cybersecurity Industry” (2016)
8 calls for the improvement of member states’ 
coordination mechanisms to prepare for large-scale cyber incidents and outlines measures to strengthen the European single market for cybersecurity products and 
 services
. Among the key initiatives under the communication, a contractual 
public-private partnership was signed between the European Commission and the European Cyber Security Organisation
9 to invest jointly in cybersecurity 
research and 
 inno
vation. 
The European Union’s Digital Single Market proposal provides guidance on 
rules for harmonization of data protection 
 r
egulations. The General Data 
Protection Regulation10 covers the processing of personal data, with special 
rules for the electronic communications sector laid out in the ePrivacy Directive (2002).
11 To preserve the efficacy of the ePrivacy rules in light of 58 | U NLEASHING  E-C OMMERCE  FOR  SOUTH  ASIAN  INTEGRATION
technological innovation, the European Commission’s proposal for an  ePriv acy 
Regulation (2017)12 complements and particularizes the General Data 
Protection Regulation for the protection of personal data and respect for pri-
vate 
 life
. The regulation protects the confidentiality of electronic communica-
tions (content and metadata), mandating that electronic communications service providers process electronic communications data without the users’ consent only for specific purposes, such as technical storage for transmission, billing, or ensuring the quality of the 
 service
. The new ePrivacy proposal is 
technology-neutral and will apply to traditional telecom operators and 
 “
over-the-top” service providers (for example, Skype and 
 WhatsA
pp). For 
online tracking, to minimize the number of cookie banners on websites, users are required to choose a specific privacy setting when they install their browser, which they can easily modify at any point in 
 time
.
Under certain situations, the private sector could take the lead in building 
viable practices that it is already implementing in the 
 mark
et. For instance, it is 
quite likely that the spread of reputable e-commerce platforms beyond their respective domestic borders and into the regional space could prove a very effec -
tive tool for better consumer protection, reducing fraud, and ensuring good data privacy standards, arising from the self-regulation adopted by large firms to safe -
guard their reputation and increase customer 
 lo
yalty. Search costs would be 
minimized by allowing e-commerce platforms to operate cross-border, rather than requiring them to establish their presence in several segmented national 
 m
arkets. This would open the possibility of exploiting economies of scale and 
reaching a larger pool of 
 cus
tomers. For consumers, the move would lead to 
greater choice, lower costs, and access to the consumer protection best practices that big companies adopt for quality control, refunds, and return 
 policies
. 
Complementary regulations can facilitate the interoperability of regional dig -
ital  platforms
. In its Communication on Online Platforms and the Digital Single 
Market Opportunities and Challenges for Europe (2016), the European Commission outlined the key issues identified in the assessment of online 
 platforms
. In this communication, it set out its position on the innovation oppor -
tunities and regulatory challenges presented by online platforms and committed to promoting further interoperability actions through issuing principles and guidance on electronic identification 
 inter
operability. Other regulations of the 
European Union (like the updated Guidance on the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive) are also relevant to online platforms, including professional diligence duties, transparency obligations, and competition 
 policy
.
The establishment of consumer trust would need to go hand in hand with the 
establishment of a unified regime for e-signatures and 
 e
-transactions. If every 
country sets different standards for what can be considered a valid proof of transaction and a binding expression of consent, then any exchange involving parties located in different countries potentially could be subject to litigation and 
 dispute
. The resulting legal uncertainty and fragmented business environ-
ment will eventually harm consumers through less competitive offers and lim-ited 
 c
hoice. For electronic transactions, Article 14.5 of the CPTPP requires 
governments to maintain frameworks that are consistent with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Model Law on Electronic Commerce 1996 or the United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International 
 Contr
acts. Similarly, the European Union has 
put forward two proposals for directives on certain aspects of B2C contracts that advocate for the full harmonization of key contract rules on, respectively, online Policy Options | 59
and other distance sales of goods,13 and the supply of digital  content.14 Articles 
14.5 and 14.6 of the CPTPP also clearly define digital signatures; therefore, the 
legal validity of a signature cannot be denied purely on the grounds that it is in electronic 
 
form.15
Integrating South Asian digital markets will need a unified payments  sys tem. 
Such a payments mechanism would eliminate the impediments encountered today by so many citizens in the region when trying to purchase or sell 
 internationally
. The policy restrictions on using national credit or debit cards for 
cross-border purchases, accepting dollar payments, and allowing internationally recognized payment providers (such as PayPal) to access certain national mar -
kets are seriously hampering the development of the e-commerce sector in many 
 countries
. Any attempt at regional e-commerce integration will need to address 
this fundamental 
 issue
. Cash on delivery for international purchases could be an 
easy first step in this direction, but trust, which is already a significant issue in e-commerce, is likely to play an even bigger role cross-country, therefore stifling international 
 tr
ansactions. Digital wallets and mobile money are becoming ever 
more popular payment methods with consumers and vendors for their immedi-acy and ease of use; therefore, it could be worth exploring these 
 possibilities
. 
Digital platforms that rely on their own payment systems could also have a sub -
stantial facilitating role, if they could operate 
 cr
oss-border. 
Establishing a unified payments system requires a multilateral regulatory 
 effort. 
For example, the Second Payment Services Directive is a fundamental 
piece of payment legislation in Europe that became effective across member states in January 2018. It sets out a common legal framework for businesses and consumers when making and receiving payments within the European Economic 
 Ar
ea. The directive relies on a commitment to increase competition in the pay -
ment system, as well as to make Internet and mobile payments easier and to allow customers to manage their accounts more 
 efficiently
. For example, the 
Second Payment Services Directive introduces two new legal categories of third-party payment providers
16 and allows third-party providers of financial services 
to operate in the entire European Union as long as they are licensed by their domestic financial 
 authorities
. 
To address delivery costs, the region needs to harmonize regulations pertain-
ing to international e-commerce of small, low-value dutiable 
 consignments
. In 
2012, cross-border delivery was considered to be an obstacle by 57 percent of retailers in Europe (Eurobarometer 2015), while nearly 50 percent of online con-sumers worried about the delivery in cross-border transactions (European Commission 2012). In particular, high delivery charges for cross-border parcel services prevent small retailers from selling or buying more, even across the European 
 U
nion. The European Union’s Digital Single Market strategy makes a 
proposal on parcel delivery,17 which seeks to increase price transparency and 
regulatory oversight of cross-border parcel delivery 
 s
ervices. The regulation 
proposes to equip national postal regulators with much-needed data for moni-toring cross-border markets and checking the affordability of 
 prices
. It will also 
encourage competition by requiring transparent and nondiscriminatory third-party access to certain cross-border parcel delivery services and 
 infr
astructure. 
The European Commission proposes to publish the public list prices of universal service providers to increase peer competition and tariff 
 tr
ansparency. Moreover, 
the regulation requires universal service providers to offer access to their cross-border networks to new market entrants, to give customers a greater choice of cross-border parcel 
 services
.60 | U NLEASHING  E-C OMMERCE  FOR  SOUTH  ASIAN  INTEGRATION
South Asia could learn from the several approaches followed by the European 
Union to address the challenges facing cross-border parcel 
 deliv
ery. For exam-
ple, the European Commission published a consultation to seek the views of all 
interested parties on possible areas for improvement that could enhance the cross-border parcel delivery market within the European 
 U
nion. In another 
instance, the European Commission set up a LinkedIn group with agents inter -
ested in the challenges pertaining to parcel 
 deliv
ery. This group allows partici-
pants to share practical concerns when shipping across borders, learn about solutions that others are developing, and contribute ideas to help achieve a bet -
ter “single market for parcel 
 deliv
ery.” These consultations and group discus-
sions revealed that the inadequacy of cross-border delivery featured as the most prominent obstacle for online retailers and consumers, hindering their deeper participation in cross-border 
 e
-commerce. The differences in technical methods 
at the European Union level within the universal postal service (in particular for external measurement of the quality of service performance) and lack of the interoperability of postal industry stakeholders could be critical in ensuring a seamless parcel delivery method across the 
 r
egion. 
Clearance of packages valued above the de minimis value and up to a thresh-
old limit should be 
 simplified. In pr
actice, this means adopting a different and 
predictable approach for goods up to a threshold limit, for instance, through an easier system for goods declaration, or by providing information that enables simple quantification and payment of payable duties and 
 tax
es. In this context, 
diverse requirements across countries generate costs and uncertainties, ham-pering compliance and discouraging e-commerce (World Customs Organization 2015). Harmonized regional solutions would at the same time restore appropri-ate incentives for e-commerce and facilitate revenue collection by 
 go
vernments. 
The exchange of information between customs authorities and e-commerce intermediaries should be promoted, as well as strengthened administrative cooperation and exchange of information between the authorities of importing and exporting 
 countries

This policy note analyzes the key drivers of e-commerce, using a conceptual 
framework that emphasizes the role of e-commerce in reducing policy and nonpolicy transaction 
 cos
ts. It includes the results of a survey of 1,688 mer -
chants and 539 e-commerce firms in seven South Asian countries, as well as a qualitative analysis of meetings with firms operating in this space in three South Asian countries: India, Nepal, and Sri 
 Lank
a. According to the survey, 
less than 40 percent of the firms reported online activity in buying and selling goods and 
 services
. Small exporting firms in South Asia were more likely to 
have online activity, compared with small firms that did not 
 e
xport. Much of 
the international trade in South Asia was reported to be with extraregional trade partners, such as China, the United Kingdom, and the United 
 S
tates. 
Although there were country variations in reported obstacles to cross-border e-commerce, among the top challenges faced by firms in the region were the high cost of cross-border logistics, onerous customs regulations (like obtaining clearance for low-value shipments), and high taxes alongside other trade barri-ers in the export 
 mark
ets.
In principle, specific policies can affect e-commerce within the country or 
region or with the rest of the 
 w
orld. In practice, there are overlaps as well as 
differences between the policies along these three  d
imensions. For example, if 
Sri Lanka mandates a consumer protection policy for its territory, all firms deliv -
ering to Sri Lankan consumers—whether based in Sri Lanka, South Asia, or out -
side South Asia—would need to adhere to the 
 policy
. In addition, national policies 
that deepen the adoption of e-commerce will affect all 
 pla
yers. However, policies 
could also favor regional players, which would be the e-commerce equivalent of regional preferential 
 arr
angements. This concluding chapter focuses on the 
regional aspect, while recognizing that many e-commerce policies will and ide -
ally should affect all firms, irrespective of location or 
 origin.
 
There is growing evidence of the potential for e-commerce within South 
Asia, on the basis of current transactions, formal and informal, as well as the increasing role of e-commerce in mediating traditional trade (starting with the search 
 element). This e
vidence includes informal business-to-consumer (B2C) 
trade; medical services facilitated by e-commerce; potential trade in digital products such as movies, music, and education services; and potential trade in Conclusions
A PRACTICAL APPROACH TO ENHANCING 
E-COMMERCE WITHIN SOUTH ASIA64 | U NLEASHING  E-C OMMERCE  FOR  SOUTH  ASIAN  INTEGRATION
high-demand products such as Bangladeshi Jamdani sarees, Indian sarees, 
women’s undergarments made in Sri Lanka, women’s suits and cotton wear made in Pakistan, and so 
 forth.
 
The sequence of the development of regional e-commerce could be thought 
of as a three-stage 
 de
velopment. The first stage is the existing informal 
 e
-commerce, which mediates the tariff and logistics 
 challenges
. The second 
stage would be the simplification of tariffs, payments, and logistical barriers, and consumers depending on the reputation of big firms as a substitute for formal, robust contractual and consumer protection mechanisms. The third stage would be more formalized regional platforms and regulations, which governments are more likely to be interested in if the second stage reaches a critical 
 mass
.
What kind of policy framework will help to catalyze e-commerce within 
South Asia? The previous chapters have laid out the core issues and drawn on global experience in cross-border e-commerce, especially from the European Union and the 11 countries that are part of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership 
 (CPTPP
). This chapter focuses largely 
on second-stage issues; that is, it adopts a practical approach to regional 
 e
-commerce with large-platform firms, enabling e-commerce transactions on 
the strength of their 
 r
eputation. These could then be followed by the more 
advanced proposals of stage three that consider regulatory harmonization in several spheres, as in the case of the European 
 U
nion. All the ideas suggested 
here address policy frictions relating to core constraints that affect cross-border e-commerce, namely, contract recognition, payments, consumer protection, logistics, and 
 tariffs
.
ENABLING REGIONAL CONTRACTING
Cross-border e-commerce could take place under different formal  arr angements. 
Today, some e-commerce platforms in India are already selling across borders 
 informally
. One way this arrangement could be formalized would be to allow 
companies to establish a regional platform, for which the suffix could be 
 “.sa.
” 
Such a platform may initially limit the range of products listed to those with lower tariffs and costs of 
 deliv
ery. Alternatively, companies could supply 
cross-border through their national platforms, with cross-border recognition of digital 
 contr
acts. From a regional perspective, the 
 “.sa” model is mor
e attractive 
because it could enable the development of regional guidelines for the operation of e-commerce platforms and allow an expanding set of countries to sign on to initial guidelines negotiated between, say, two 
 countries
. The national platform 
model, by contrast, would require a series of bilateral negotiations and guide-lines, which could make it more difficult to aggregate later into a regional 
 
solution.1 
In either case, countries would need to agree to recognize each other’s digital 
transaction mechanisms to make the cross-border contracts legally 
 binding
. To 
the extent that national approaches are broadly in line with the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Model Law on Electronic Commerce, or the United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts, the recognition of digital transactions can be 
 facilitated.
 
However, there is still a lack of clarity, and there are institutional gaps in the legal frameworks for e-transactions within South Asian countries that would need to Conclusions | 65
be remedied (see chapter 5). Countries would also need to cooperate on data 
privacy laws and cybersecurity to protect consumer data irrespective of consum-ers’ country of origin and to pursue cybercrime issues at a regional 
 le
vel. 
FACILITATING PRACTICAL PAYMENT SOLUTIONS
A fundamental issue is consumer access to foreign  e xchange. For example, 
national credit or debit cards cannot be used for cross-border payments in Nepal, and PayPal cannot be used to receive payments from overseas in Bhutan, Nepal, and Sri 
 Lank
a. Practical fixes have already emerged in the private sector; for 
example, Nepalese are ordering on India-based websites such as Flipkart and 
 Amazon.in and ha
ving the products delivered to them through friends and rela-
tives who travel or work in 
 India. Another option is cash on deliv
ery, but that 
solution would have to contend with trust issues and the conversion of local cur -
rency to international currency, unless, for example, platform firms like Flipkart invest and incorporate in 
 N
epal. 
More efficient solutions would allow payment initiation service providers2 
(PISPs), which provide a software bridge between banks and merchants, to receive money in each country for goods and services 
 e
xported. For imports, 
central banks could, if they wished, cap the amount of cross-border purchases per year per consumer via e-commerce, which can also be done through PISPs (to make things easier for 
 c
onsumers). To facilitate regional transactions, per -
haps 50   per
cent of this cap could be restricted to purchases from within South 
 Asia. 
Depending on their comfort levels, central banks could increase these caps 
over  
time.
These would be interim solutions until the regulations enable cross-border 
PISPs to operate throughout South Asia (or even in 
 subr
egions). An option 
would be a South Asia digital wallet, which is also an efficient payments 
 solution.
 
For example, in India, Paytm, Flipkart, and 
 Amazon.in no
w provide their own 
digital  w
allets. Access to these services from other South Asian countries would 
require regulatory permission from the respective country authorities and com-pliance from the 
 mer
chants.
PROTECTING THE CONSUMER
Regulations on consumer protection are uneven in South  Asia. While policy  
plays catchup, it is possible that firms can fill the 
 v
oid. Success in e-commerce 
depends critically on consumer confidence in the firm’s ability to deliver the promised product and quality and to ensure a simple return 
 policy
. The instan-
taneous ratings that consumers provide prompt e-commerce firms to 
 cons
tantly improve the quality of their offerings, which they do by penalizing 
erring 
 suppliers and implementing a consumer
-oriented return or redressal 
 policy
. Strong competition among existing and new e-commerce firms further 
propels this 
 logic.
 
Consumers in countries such as India and Sri Lanka tend to rely on the repu-
tation of large digital platforms—which often go beyond the letter of the law—to protect their 
 inter
ests. This same reputation effect is likely to prevail across bor -
ders and protect consumer interests in countries receiving products from firms 66 | U NLEASHING  E-C OMMERCE  FOR  SOUTH  ASIAN  INTEGRATION
in neighboring  mark ets. The one issue here can be cross-border product returns, 
which may be too cumbersome from a regulatory 
 s
tandpoint. To get around this, 
firms may prefer to provide a return solution within the consumer’s country, 
which would require cross-border investment or tie up with a local 
 firm. This
 
may possibly imply an initial limited menu of product offerings, which could gradually increase as confidence increases on all sides: the consumer, the cross-border e-commerce firm, and the local partner of that 
 firm.
 
CREATING A PREDICTABLE TARIFF AND DELIVERY SYSTEM 
South Asia’s regulations are not conducive to promoting  tr ade. It has the highest 
average tariff rates among regions, high tariff dispersion, and nontransparent tariffs, and many countries’ trade regimes discriminate against South Asian 
 neighbors
. Because intraregional trade is low, the question being asked is 
whether e-commerce can help to nudge countries to trade more, capitalizing on their shared culture, tastes, proximity, and growing middle 
 class
.
A clear de minimis tariff system, preferably with the same threshold across 
South Asian countries, will 
 help
. This would imply zero duties for imports that 
are valued, say, below US$100. Between the de minimis and a threshold value, 
the customs clearance process should be simple and 
 clear
. For example, all goods 
valued between US$100 and US$500 could be assessed a simple duty of 10 per -
cent (all figures are illustrative only), with fast-track customs clearance, on the basis of ex ante information exchanged between customs officials and 
 e
-commerce 
 firms
. These simplified regulations would also help to reduce the 
congestion at customs arising from growing cross-border parcel 
 shipments
.
Given foreign exchange restrictions in several countries, total imports under 
the de minimis and threshold limits could be subject to a yearly cap per con-sumer in some 
 countries
. Of this cap, perhaps 50 percent could again be reserved 
for purchases from within South 
 Asia. The cap need not be uniform acr
oss 
 countries
. The cap could be enforced by e-commerce firms rather than authori-
ties, which would ease the impact on 
 consumers
.
Keeping focus on the B2C segment, reduced frictions in delivery of small or 
parcel shipments will need to accompany simplified tariff  r
egulations. One 
issue is the high costs of cross-border parcel deliveries (e-commerce-related logistics are a major constraint for cross-border e-commerce 
 sales). Incr
easing 
competition and transparency in cross-border parcel services in South Asia, as proposed in the European Union’s Digital Single Market strategy, will need to be part of the 
 solution. M
oreover, it may be helpful to consult the region’s 
logistics providers on an ongoing basis, extending the European Commission’s idea, to develop solutions specific to South 
 Asia. As in the Eur
opean Union, a 
regional agreement between South Asian postal service providers could be explored, in due 
 time
.
In sum, the final consumer price of products traded via cross-border 
 e
-commerce in South Asia can be reduced by easing the tariff framework and 
making it more predictable, increasing competition in cross-border logistics ser -
vices, and listening to and incorporating practical suggestions from logistics 
 pr
oviders. In addition, in some cases, airports in neighboring countries could be 
more 
 efficient for cr
oss-border delivery (for example, Varanasi for parts of 
Nepal), which will require cross-border vehicular 
 access
. Conclusions | 67
DEVELOPING A REGIONAL MARKET FOR E-TRANSPORT 
SERVICES 
Transport (and logistics) services are not only an input into e-commerce; they 
also are transacted digitally 
 (
e-transport). These services can be made more 
 efficient b
y allowing cross-border competition and eliminating the restrictions 
on such trade in South Asia 
 toda
y. Allowing trucks to cross land borders, instead 
of transloading their cargo, would significantly improve the delivery of 
 par
cels. 
Operationalizing the Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal Motor Vehicles Agreement (BBIN MVA) would be a good starting point for this process, supple -
mented by off-border clearances to reduce congestion in land 
 ports
. In addition, 
small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) can benefit if multiconsignment goods are allowed to be carried in the same truck and off-border clearance of low-value small shipments is 
 permitted.
 
Another set of reforms could potentially be even more 
 impactful. These
 
would require national regulations, which are currently quite restrictive, to allow hybrid models of goods and passenger 
 tr
ansport. Combined with the 
 technological po
wer of app-based aggregator models, this could unleash major 
efficiency gains (including reduction in costs, congestion, and pollution) through, for example, carrying small shipments in the trunk of a passenger 
 v
ehicle. In 
time, this model can be extended to cross-border cooperation in the BBIN region because BBIN MVA applies to goods and passenger 
 services
. 
NOTES
 1 . In some cases, companies may choose the localization model, incorporating in each 
 country
. For example, Daraz has local e-commerce entities in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and 
Sri 
 Lank
a. This means that it has decided that each website could offer a different range of 
products, and that there are currently too many uncertainties in trying to operate in the 
cross-border space in South 
 Asia.

takes place within some South Asian countries. This holds promise for the development in South Asia of formal e-commerce, which, unlike informal 
 e
-commerce, protects the consumer and can supplement government revenue. 
This report has outlined practical steps to kick-start the formal market, as 
well as more ambitious ideas that could be implemented once the market has taken off. The practical approach involves a combination of the following steps: 
•
 C
atalyze the growth of the formal market by permitting cross-border 
 e
-commerce payments, perhaps up to a maximum value per consumer and 
50 percent reserved for intraregional purchases. 
•
 Ins
titute a de minimis tariff system and a low-value threshold option that is 
smooth and predictable. 
•
 Pursue fle
xible transport solutions that allow technology and apps to create 
efficiency gains and trucks and passenger vehicles to cross land borders. 
•
 Le
verage the reputation of large e-commerce platforms to offer consumer 
protection, return and redress, and data security as an initial substitute for 
robust contractual and consumer protection mechanisms. 
•
 S
tart with an incremental approach if necessary—for example, designate an 
“authorized operator” in e-commerce, with countries mutually agreeing on a list of internationally recognized and nationally reputed companies to get the ball rolling. This approach can help governments and consumers build confidence. 
As a cautionary note, an aggressive e-commerce-development strategy can 
raise some important issues relating to competition. This is especially true in the 
context of South Asia, where manufacturing capabilities are still at a nascent stage. Clearly, the strengthening of e-commerce in the region will produce sig -
nificant immediate benefits for consumers, in terms of convenience, variety, and prices. However, the e-commerce space lends itself to substantial economies of both scale and scope, and as such tends to be dominated by a small number of large platforms competing for market share and consumers’ data. As of now, the big players in the South Asian market are competing fiercely to boost sales and Final Thoughts

E-COMMERCE MARKET70 | U NLEASHING  E-C OMMERCE  FOR  SOUTH  ASIAN  INTEGRATION
build customer loyalty, which in practice translates into offers of ever-better 
deals, the provision of “free” ancillary services, and the adoption of 
 consumer
-friendly business practices. Quite predictably, however, most or all 
of these firms are currently not making profits, as the medium-term strategy is for them to burn money now to eventually become market leaders later. How long it will take until this happens, and what consequences will derive from this reorganization of the market structure is, however, a subject for debate. Therefore, a strategy for South Asian integration should feature a review of 
 competition policy in the r
egion, to account for the quasi-natural monopoly 
nature of the e-commerce market.
Relatedly, like every trade openness measure, e-commerce is also exposing 
the South Asian domestic economies to import competition from abroad. Despite the usual portrait of e-commerce as a booster of domestic production and as a tool for the integration of small and medium entrepreneurs into larger markets, there are questions surrounding this in the South Asian landscape. In particular, consultations with e-commerce platforms in the region revealed that most of the merchandise being sold online comes from third countries (especially from China) rather than being produced by local manufacturers. Although this may represent just an organic development as opening to trade rearranges the spe -
cialization patterns of the countries involved, it is also possible that these dynam-ics may stifle domestic production more than proportionally. Extra care should be taken, therefore, to ensure that the interests of small, national producers are not unduly sacrificed for the sake of short-term consumer gains. A promising strategy in this respect would be to invest in the development of e-commerce-
 
intensiv
e productive sectors in which South Asia enjoys a comparative advan-
tage in the eyes of South Asian consumers. These could be products that bundle goods with strong services (for example, design, or after-sales services), content goods (like entertainment products), or those products that are less standard-ized and customized to local tastes. The question then remains whether 
 e
-commerce could nurture these products, enabling them to flourish both in 
exports and in the import-competing space.ECO-AUDIT

This report is part of a broader work program on shaping a more positive 
narrative on regional integration in South Asia. It is a follow-up to a 
recent flagship report published by the South Asia Region of the World Bank, A Glass Half Full: The Promise of Regional Trade in South Asia.
E-commerce is dramatically changing the way goods and services are 
transacted nationally, regionally, and globally. It facilitates international trade by reducing the cost of distance and remoteness and can be more inclusive of underrepresented groups such as women, small businesses, and rural entrepreneurs. Intraregional trade in South Asia is still below its potential, and the region lags behind other parts of the world in activating the potential benefits from e-commerce.
Adopting a novel yet practical approach, this report explores how 
e-commerce can be boosted to deepen intraregional trade in South Asia. It examines the main transacting models in the digital space and the channels through which e-commerce helps reduce transactions costs for firms and consumers. It considers the regulations, as well as the regulatory gaps, affecting private sector participation in e-commerce, focusing on data privacy, consumer protection, delivery, cybersecurity, market-access regulations, and digital payments. Finally, the report presents recommendations for regulatory reforms that could enhance e-trade, especially in a regional context and as a possible platform for greater global engagement by South Asian firms. The scale of these recommendations ranges from the modest, such as allowing cross-border payments and streamlining the customs regime, to the more ambitious, such as allowing the operation of regional e-commerce platforms and liberalizing related cross-border logistics services.
