EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
 
Digital trade is opening new development opportunities for Pakistan.  Digital technologies transform 
global trade, the reallocation of factors of production, and eventually increases productivity and growth. 
Digital technologies also enable industries to produce more sophisticated products and services and  tap 
into new expo rt markets. In turn, digital trade enhances Pakistan's domestic competitiveness as it allows 
firms to become more productive. In this context, a factor determining digital trade is data. Many digital 
technologies thrive  on data, which often needs to flow a cross borders. Encouraging digital trade and the 
cross -border flow of data through open markets will ultimately enhance  Pakistan's level of development.  
 
Pakistan should seize digital trade opportunities as they are  becoming increasingly important for 
the world economy.2 Between 2004 and 2017, world ICT services exports as a share of  global GDP has 
more than doubled from 0.30 percent to around 0.66 percent. Equally, expressed as a share of total services 
export s, world ICT services has more than doubled be tween 2000 and 2017 from a narrow 5 percent to 
more than 10 percent. Interestingly, the importance of world ICT services exports has become almost as 
large as the share of world ICT goods, which currently stands at 11 percent. In short, the ICT trade in 
goods and , in particular , services has grown significantly over the past 20 years and this trend is expected 
to continue.  
 
In addition, cross -border data flows have increased significantly in recent years, thereby 
contributing substantially to global GDP. The domestic and cross -border flow of data has grown 
exponentially over the past 10 years, which indicates that data as a flow, besides goods, services, 
investment , and people, has become a well -established pillar of today’s globalization. The McKinsey 
Glob al Institute estimates that , currently , cross -border data flows contribute more to global GDP than the 
goods trade. Given that data flows underpin the production and trade of services, in particular ICT services, 
this factor is likely to increase further in importance as the growth of the ICT services trade continues.  
 
As global  value -added of both ICT goo ds and services is growing, the sector is an important 
contributor to higher value -added overall. The current share of ICT value -added in the OECD stands 
at 6 percent. That share is likely to be lower for poorer countries such as Pakistan. That does not me an, 
however, that the sector is unimportant for Pakistan’s development strategy. For instance, high -
productivity firms are generally more likely to use the internet, larger firms are more likely to use the 
internet more intensively across all income groups , and the internet is helping firms of all types and sizes 
to reach new markets. The role of platforms increases as these trends continue as they cut search costs, 
and reduce fixed costs to start a business as well as to export , thereby helping new export markets. All 
 
2 This report adopts the OECD d efinition of digital trade. Digital trade encompasses digitally enabled transactions of 
trade in goods and services that can either be digitally or physically deliv ered, and that involve consumers, firms, 
and governments. Also, while all forms of digital trade are enabled by digital technologies, not all digital trade is 
digitally delivered. Digital trade also involves digitally enabled but physically delivered trade  in goods and services . 
In this context, u nderpinning digital trade is the movement of data. Data is not only a means of production, it is also 
an asset that can itself be  traded, and a means through which GVCs are organized  and services delivered. Moreove r, 
according to OECD, i t also underpins physical trade less directly by  enabling implementation of trade facilitation.  
Data is also at the core of new and rapidly growing service supply models such as  cloud computing, the Internet of 
Things (IoT), and addi tive manufacturing.  For a full discussion see, OECD https://www.oecd.org/trade/  
topics/digital -trade/

Official Use  these factors help to creat e higher economy -wide value -added as all sectors use ICT goods and services as 
inputs.  
 
This report analyses the recent trends in Pakistani Information Technologies (IT) and Information 
Technologies enabled Services  (ITeS), as well as obstacles confronted by firms.  We assess the 
importance of trade costs as a barrier to services  growth and development  in Pakistan ’s domestic market 
and to seizing the opportunities of global trade . The report also aims to understand and examin e the impact 
of obstacles (i.e., trade costs) confronted by firms.  These obstacles increase the costs of selling services 
and may reduce capacity to compete both in the local market (Pakistan) as well as overseas (exports). 
These obst acles include direct costs generated by policy barriers that limit  market entry , but can also 
include infrastructure deficiencies, geographical  location , and institutional capacities , and/or obstacles 
imposed by regulatory measures. Among the latter obstac les, examples include difficulties in accessing 
the information necessary to operate in a market , the predictability and stability of the business 
environment in a particular market , and the quality of the decision -making process and administrative 
procedu res of competent authorities  in the domestic and export markets .  
 
The focus of the report is the  trade costs confronted by  IT and ITeS firms . IT and ITeS  operations  are 
the backbone to provide digital services, digital goods and depend on digital technologies , conform  an 
integral part of the overall ecosystem . The report relies on a survey conducted on 782 IT and ITeS  firms 
across different cities . The objective of t he survey was to examine the importance of these factors for 
Pakistani firms  and to provide advice to policymakers. To complement  the survey results, the main 
findings  were discussed in focus group structured interviews . Firms interviewed cover ed different services 
activities beyond software companies  and include d both exporters (534 firms) and non -exporters (248 
firms), reflecting the export competitiveness as well as domestic competitiveness of Pakistan's IT  services 
sector. The analysis aims to improv e our understanding of Pakistan's IT performance and the obstacles 
confronted in this field.  
 
IT/ITeS and Digital Trade Performance3 
 
In recent years, there has been significant progress in the IT/digital space in Pakistan . Internet access 
for individuals increased from 8 percent in 2010 to 15.5 percent in 2017, the latest available data, while 
the proportion of households with internet access increased fourfold, reaching 22 percent. However, as 
measured by the ICT Development Index (IDI), compa red to other countries in the world Pakistan ranks 
low.4 Although Pakistan’s IT industry has grown into a moderately sized sector, it is comprised of mostly 
domestically owned firms with very few foreign operations. Of the top 10 exporters, only one is fo reign . 
 
Yet, Pakistan is the second highest exporter of IT  services in South Asia behind India, with more 
than  US$1 billion of exports . According to the Pakistan Software Houses Association (PASHA)  website , 
about 53.8 percent of the revenue comes from the export market. IT/ITeS services exports have 
 
3 ICT services are services such as computer and communications services (telecommunications , postal , and courier 
services) and information services (computer data and news -related service transactions). Digital goods is a generic 
term that refers to ICT goods, commodities , and inputs. In this report digital goods refer in larg e part to goods covered 
by the WTO’s International Technology Agreement (ITA). Digital services  is a generic term that refers to ICT and 
associated services that are produced and delivered over the internet and /or with the help of ICT and other software. 
It mainly includes computer, telecoms, some news -related services and information, data services, various technical 
services, as well as services provided over digital platforms (see annex for additional definitions).

Official Use  experienced solid growth in recent years  with a compound average growth rate (CAGR) of 10.8 percent 
since 2010, growing from US$433 million to more than US$1 billion. Pakistan's IT services exports are 
primarily  in medium to low value -added software activities, such as enterprise planning, application 
development, and integration. However, while there is limited activity in product development  in 
Pakistan’s IT services sector, a small number of firms nonetheless outsource services in the banking, 
financial, insurance, healthcare, and energy industr ies, which are likely to be more sophisticated.  
 
Enabling Factors and Policy Environment  
 
Pakistan maintains relatively restricted digital trade policies, as measured by the Digital Trade 
Restrictiveness Index (DTRI).  The DTRI is an indicator that measures applied digital restrictions for ICT 
goods, digital services and investments, standards in digital sectors, as well as for the cross -border flow 
and domestic  use of data.  The DTRI has many categories of restrictions varying from (a) fiscal restrictions 
such as tariffs and trade defense; (b) establishment restrictions such as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) 
restrictions and restrictive intellectual property rights (IPRs) measures; (c) restrictions on data varying 
from restrictions on the cross -border flow of data to intermediate liability policies; and (d) trading 
restrictions, such as quantitative trade restrictions and restrictive standards in digital trade.  
 
Pakistan's main digital trade policy obstacles are found in the area of fiscal restrictions, while the 
establishment restrictions in digital sectors are relatively low. Pakistan appears in the top 5 list of 
countries most restricted for tariffs, trade defense, taxation, and subsidies policies. Pakistan maintain s a 
simple  average MFN applied tariff rate of 9.7 percent on digital products, with peaks of 35 percent. Adding 
up the regulatory and addi tional customs duties – also applied on imports – bring s total customs duties to 
13.7 percent on average . The country also has an anti -dumping measure in place on imports of phthalic 
anhydride (which is an input used to make PVC for cables) from India, Ira n, Italy, Thailand, Brazil, China, 
Indonesia, Republic of Korea, and Hong Kong.  
 
Taxation remains challenging  in Pakistan . Representatives from the IT sector noted that the lack of tax 
harmonization for services industries across the provinces creates a heavy burden in terms of duties, as 
well as in compliance. Dealing with tax authorities is costly for firms in terms of time and financial 
resources and was identified by the private sector during field interviews as one of the most challenging 
areas in their business. This is due , in part,  to the complex nature of modern business models required by 
ICT/digital firms, but is also due to existing tax regulatory environment and enforcement approaches.   
 
Although Pakistan does not have any full data localization requirement, it nonetheless places  some 
restrictions regarding data.  The country  has significantly stricter rules regardin g content access 
compar ed with some of its peers, such as Thailand, Indonesia, India, and Russia. Pakistan appears to 
control foreign commercial services content to its domestic market, and the government has provided a 
mandate for filtering legal content.  A related concern for Pakistan’s IT services export s is the surge of 
stricter data regulations applied by various countries in the world.  Restrictive data policies  such as data 
localization measures,  and other services that are produced with the help of advanced software , will 
discourage the growth of high value -added and content -intensive activities . This also means that Pakistan 
is likely to suffer if it were to implement these policies itself, as it would reduce services trade between 
countries.  While privacy and data protection are important legitimate policy objectives, t hey should be 
achieved in the least restrictive manner to allow for the development of the industry  based on 
interna tional ly recognized  principles .5

Official Use  Currently, Pakistan ’s IT servic es firms face obstacles in foreign markets while trading.  In most part, 
these obstacles are of a trade facilitation nature as they relate to the regulatory requirements that exist in 
export markets. They are an entry barrier for Pakistan i firms because the y create compliance costs when 
entering the market , For e xample work permit regulations or entry visa requirements. The latter is the 
single most crucial item identified by Pakistani exporters that report this factor as an obstacle. By contrast, 
regulatory  predictability, timeframes, and applicability of regulations in foreign destinations are less of a 
problem for Pakistan i exporters. Engagement with trading partners will be critical for dealing with visa 
restrictions .  
 
Pakistan ’s IT services firms also face obstacles in the home market.  Survey results showed that the 
two most important domestic obstacles relate to electricity shortages and IT infrastructure. The latter 
includes the country's telecom network market as well as IT -goods that are necess ary as an input for 
producing and exporting IT  services. The next two most significant obstacles that firms face in Pakistan 
are of a regulatory nature : insufficient intellectual property right protection and the entry of foreign 
competitors in export mark ets. The former is something that Pakistan policymakers can change in the 
short -term domestically. A change in the latter would also depend on policymakers in the export markets, 
and last generation trade agreements are an instrument that could help to ove rcome these challenges.  
 
For non -exporting firms in Pakistan that rely on the domestic market , reported obstacles relate to 
the domestic enabling environment.  Furthermore, regulatory requirements, rising wages, skills 
availability , and labor market regula tions are also identified as important obstacles by non -exporting IT 
firms. While graduates from top universities in Pakistan, such as Lahore University of Management 
Sciences (LUMS), are fully employable by the industry, firms in Pakistan that produce hig h value -added 
products find that only 10 percent of graduates from lower -tier universities  are employable . For lower -end 
software services firms this percentage is 50 percent. This gap signifies the lack of suitable and 
contemporary programming skills in P akistan. Also, weak English is identified as a major drawback 
stemming from lack of qualified teachers and modern curriculum at all levels of education.6  
 
IT and IT -enabled service s exports have become one of the most successful international activities 
in recent years.  The survey explores reasons why there are IT firms in Pakistan that do not  yet engage  in 
global operations, despite proven opportunities and real success stories in the country. For instance, 37 
percent of non-exporting  firms prefer to focus on the domestic market. Thirty -five percent consider their 
lack of  exportable services as a reason for not engaging in international business. For 30 percent of non-
exporting firms, a ccess to information on opportunities for exporting , as well as regulatory barriers and 
complexity of regulations , are two critical explanations for not participating in export activities.  
 
Policy recommendations  
 
Under the right policy direction, Pakistan is likely to experience fundamental changes in it s economy, 
steering to a more innovation -based, knowledge -intensive way of producing and trading. In addition, the 
outbreak of the Covid -19 pandemic emphasized the importance of IT and IT -enabled services as crucial 
inputs to continue producing while prese rving social distancing. It is still unknown what  the post -Covid -
19 business landscape will look like, but IT and IT -enabled services will play an even more prominent 
role than they do today. In addition , automation and artificial intelligence will play a more significant role 
in this industry  by introducing significant changes in business models  and strategies . To ensure Pakistan 
is ready to embrace that new environment, its IT/ITeS and digital trade policy framework needs to be right. 
The ingredients for a successful reform strategy should include  interventions in three policy areas :  a) 
 
6 Couto and Fernandez -Stark (2019); State Bank of Pakistan (2018) and Government of Pakistan (2014).   
- 10 - 
 
Official Use  regulatory capabilities and governance; b) sector -specific policies; and c) complementary supporting 
policies.  Also, digital trade policies take  place at two levels. At the national level, domestic policies play 
a critical role in reduc ing trade costs  and enhanc ing competitiveness. But domestic policies by themselves 
do not open foreign markets ; they need to be complemented by international policies aim ed at helping the 
private sector to thrive in the global economy. In this  context, every domestic policy should be 
complemented by international initiative s at the multilateral, regional (SAR and beyond ), and bilateral 
levels.  International initiative s can be based in different instruments: a ) seeking technical assistance from 
trading partners, international organizations, and private sector to address specific challenges; b ) 
cooperation, collaboration, memorandum of understanding, and other flexible in struments to formalize 
partnership among regulators, public entities, and other agencies; and c ) more formal binding  agreements  
to provide a more stable and predictable arrangement to support the country ’s globalization.      
 
I. Regulatory capabilities and go vernance  
 
i. Create new institutional capabilities and moderniz e regulatory arrangements. For example,  
while firms' registration processes have improved significantly in recent years (e.g. online 
registration has been introduced), the licensing process is still difficult. Licenses are also required 
to be renewed  regularly . Procedures for renewals are unnecessarily long and require similar 
documents as a de novo  license. Firms need to work with lawyers and auditors, which increases 
operating costs  and discourage s formalization and scaling up of small and medium -size firms. 
Freelancers face significant challenges in open ing bank accounts due to existing regulations and 
acceding foreign markets. The new business models created by these technologies r equire training 
public officials to facilitate their understanding  of how businesses are organized and operate and to 
modernize regulations . It will require transforming existing legal requirements for creating firms 
and supervising firms' operations, upda ting the taxation system, and foreign exchange regulations, 
and using new technologies. The public and private sectors should jointly organize trainings, agree 
on courses ’ contents and requirements, and issue certification to public officials that attend. The 
trainings should aim to increas e knowledge and understanding of new business models, discuss 
international management practices in the context of digital technologies, and adopt modern 
regulatory approaches.   
 
ii. Strengthen regulatory governance.  The report finds that the main challenges in regulatory 
matters in Pakistan are twofold: on the one hand, there are weak regulatory procedures in place, 
regulatory requirements are difficult to understand and, in some cases, unpredictable, and 
regulation enforcement is uneven and subject to discretion. On the other hand, there are significant 
capacity gaps among agencies responsible for regulatory matters beyond the poor understanding of 
business models in the context of the digital economy. Thes e problems should be addressed by a 
gradual adoption and effective implementation of basic internationally recognized regulatory 
principles such as the OECD good regulatory practices, strengthening capacity at agency levels, 
including at the provincial lev el.7 
 
iii. Invest in data collection . Policy decisions, incentive programs , and schemes need to be informed 
and monitored by data. Pakistan needs to establish a more comprehensive framework for data 
collection at different levels: macro and firm -level data are  essential, as well as national and 
provincial -level data. The d ata should include domestic variables and precise international 
transaction s to measure the main trends, development, and characteristics of the sector and the 
firms. Similarly, Pakistan lacks  detailed firm -level information. The recent empirical literature on 
 
7 OECD (2014).   
- 11 - 
 
Official Use  trade, including the empirical trade policy research, has moved in the direction of using more and 
more information at firm -level , for which economic information such as productivity can be 
analysed. Information would not only include standard variables such as value -added, production, 
sales, input usage (divided over raw materials, goods , and specific services), but also exports, 
imports, capital stock, employment (i.e. number of workers) , wages, and R&D expenses, etc. This 
data should be sorted by firm ID, year, location of the firm, and/or firm type. Usually, such 
information is based on a firm’s balance sheet, which, in many countries, firms are obliged to 
provide to national statistica l agencies through surveys. It would be essential for Pakistan to set up 
a team of statisticians and economists to work on collecting such data.  
 
II. Sector -specific policies  
 
i. Accelerat e the adoption  of digital technologies. Digital technologies will become more relevant 
to support governments ’ services  and policies , including during emergencies.  The Covid -19 crisis 
has forced government s to get closer to citizens and firms while  deliver ing solutions  from a 
distance. Physical i nteractions  between peopl e and public officials  have been constrained  and 
digital solutions have been designed  across the world  to reach out remotely to support businesses 
and households that are immediately affected by policy responses  and the economic slowdown. 
The Government of  Pakistan should accelerate the implementation of e -government solutions and  
move to a process of automation for government -to-business interactions . While progress has been 
significant in recent year s, for instance, connecting farmers to markets, Pakistan  is still lagging on 
government digitalization.8 Pakistan should develop policies conducive to accelerat ing adoption of 
innovative digital solutions, in collaboration with the private sector , to improve service delivery in 
a post -Covid -19 policy environme nt.  
 
ii. Lower tariffs on digital goods and reduce taxes levied on data . High duties on imports 
constrain access to high -quality inputs needed in downstream IT -sectors.9 Pakistan still  applies 
duties on imports  of digital products at an average of  13.7 percent , increasing  production costs for 
all sectors in the economy – particularly in a context in which digital technologies can help the 
economy function to some extent while preserving social distancing. The reduction should be 
gradual and focus on products included in the WTO’s Information Te chnology Agreement. On 
domestic taxation, there are two related issues : a) taxation policies; and b) tax administration and 
practices (governance). This issue requires urgent attention from the authorities at the central and 
provincial levels. Pakistan wil l benefit from simplification and better coordination of tax 
authorities.  
 
iii. Improve human capital related to technology innovations . The focus should be to fill the skills 
gaps that are essential for the digital economy and are required by the IT and ITeS industry. First , 
the Higher Education Commission (HEC) in Pakistan, universities, and other stakeholders should 
collaborate and agree on a curricular update that aims to tackle  the country’s professional and 
technical needs. Second, the IT industry, on the  other hand, needs to better identify and 
communicate the learning requirements and missing skills,  including soft skills. Third, a 
mechanism to improve the integration of lower -tier universities with industry is also required. One 
option to speed up the p rocess is to facilitate hiring coders from the private sector to teach courses 
in universities. Finally, HEC and universities need to start recognizing credit from online courses 
(e.g. online coding courses from Coursera and EdX that have the necessary qua lity accreditation).

Official Use  This will allow students to accelerate upgrading their skills. In the context of the current Covid -
19 crisis this has become even more relevant and urgent. In the case of Pakistan, there are 
significant specific skill gaps among comput er science engineers and professionals which need to 
be tackled to ensure the future growth of the sector, including: (i) inability to code in contemporary 
technology platforms; (ii) weak English skills; (iii) poor comprehension readiness to address 
foreig n clients' concerns; (iv) inadequate soft skills, namely communication and teamwork; and 
(v) poor knowledge of corporate culture, e.g. reporting, compliance, escalations, email etiquette, 
and protocols.10 
 
 
iv. Strengthen promotion activities. While the role and contribution to the internationalization of 
Pakistani firms of the Pakistan Software Exports Board (PSEB) is recognized, the institution could 
be strengthened. PSEB should dedicate more effective efforts to support firms’ participation in 
international promotion activities in close coordination with the Trade Development Authority of 
Pakistan, while maintaining its efforts to facilitate business activities and streamlin e procedures 
and regulations. PSEB is  perceived as a relatively weak organization that has  not achieved  the 
performance expected from businesses and does not strategically use Pakistan i representations 
abroad. PSEB should learn from and adopt good promotion practices from successful experienc es, 
including in Costa Rica, India , and the Philippines. Strengthening PSEB promotion activities will 
require to overcome resources constraints and mobilize financial resources from interested private 
sector. It also requires adopting managerial practices according to promotion activities, 
establishing and implementing a strategy with clear and measurable indicators and a monitoring 
and evaluation framework, and hir ing staff with the require d capabilities.  
 
III. Complementary supporting  policies   
 
i. Introduce regulatory changes to personal data protection.  The objective of the regulation 
should, on the one hand, aim to achiev e the legitimate policy objective, i.e., data and consumer 
protection, and on the other hand, allow data flow to promote high val ue-added services activities. 
In other words, these regulations should avoid increasing input costs for firms, ultimately 
affecting their productivity. This can be achieved by  subscribing to general principles broadly 
accepted internationally , such as the OECD privacy principles guidelines, or from the Asia–
Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC) forum. Ultimately, a strong international ly recognize d 
regulatory regime will be required to allow for constructive cooperation between Pakistan and its 
main trading p artners  to allow flow of data . This will require a delicate balance of share d 
responsibilities from both the data source country and the destination country. It will also require 
increasing levels of convergence on privacy protection requirements set by da ta source countries 
and the protection standards offered by the data destination countries.11  
 
ii. Improve the intellectual property rights (IPR) framework and create trust in the system 
for digital companies.  Pakistan is already active primarily in information technology 
outsourcing (ITO) and business process outsourcing (BPO). These services account for 87 
percent and 13 percent of Pakistan's total services exports, respectively. However, to sustain 
growth in this sector and to e ncourage firms to come up with innovations in the industry, 
intellectual property needs to be adequately protected. The private sector pointed out the 
importance of IPRs for their future growth. Seventy -three percent of exporting firms and 64

Official Use  percent of no n-exporting firms surveyed consider ed that insufficient IPR in Pakistan is an 
obstacle for their business. The issues identified by the private sector deal with three related 
aspects: a ) improve implementation and enforcement; b ) increase capacity to manag e IPR-related 
matters by public entities; and c ) improve protections in certain specific aspects such a s 
undisclosed information. To move up in the IT and digital services value chain, both IPRs and 
access to commercial data are critical pillars. The agend a on IPRs and privacy concerns in trade 
agreements will be accentuated with cross -border data flows. At the international level, IPR has 
long been part of the global trade agenda, but a new factor determining digital trade is data. 
Content providers could restrict the provision of some services to countries where IPRs are 
inadequately protected. This can increase difficulties in generating exportable content as well as 
affecting access to imported content.  
 
iii. Engag e in trade agreements. Restrictions on cross -border data flow through, for example, data 
localization requirements, are increasing . Pakistan's entrepreneurs face significant limitation s to 
travel to promote their business and develop opportunities. Provisions related to IPRs and  
consumer privacy and data protection  have increasingly been included in last generation trade 
agreements, and services trade, including through temporary movement of person s, have also 
been addressed. Pakistan should evaluate a strategy to engage in trade  agreements to address its 
business interests proactively.12 Regional and bilateral trade agreements are likely to be central 
in driving connectedness to markets  given the existing challenges at the multilateral level.

DIGITAL PAKISTAN :  
A BUSINESS AND TRADE  ASSESSMENT  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The increased use of digital technologies in the world economy provides companies and countries 
with an opportunity to improve  trade competitiveness and , ultimately , productivity.  The use of digital 
technologies makes standard factors such as labor and capital more productive by reinforcing their 
allocation, which increases aggregate productivity. International trade is a vehicle for reinforcing the 
allocation of factor resources b ecause open markets generally give countries the opportunity to receive the 
latest , most up -to-date ideas and technologies from abroad. This makes domestic industries more 
competitive. Moreover, digital technologies allow countries to sophisticate their pr oducts and production 
technologies, moving into new areas to export to other countries.  Further to this, in the context of the 
Covid -19 pandemic, digital technologies provide – in many cases – a platform to allow the economy to 
operate while preserving the  necessary social distancing for containing the spread of the virus.   
 
Digital trade  provides new opportunities for Pakistan.  Importing digital goods and services in which 
new technologies are embedded or allowing for foreign investments in digital sector s would only make 
traditional ways of produc ing more effective in the country. Furthermore, exporting newly created goods 
and services that have undergone an upgrade because of new digital technologies typically carry a higher 
level of value -added that fir ms, and eventually countries, can reap when exporting. A particular  factor 
concerning  digital trade is data. Data flow across borders multiple times to develop new products and 
services and to optimize production processes across the various international production stages. In all 
these instances, encouraging digital trade and the cross -border flow of data through open markets would 
enhance productivity.  
 
However, not all countries are tapping  into digital trade opportunities. As firms have embedded more 
and more ICT and internet technologies in their products and services as well as supply chains, there has 
been an  exponential growth of data in the world economy , and countries have reacted in different ways 
regarding digital policies.13 For instance, countries such as China, Vietnam , and Indonesia have , over the 
years , introduced burdensome regulations that restrict the flow of data, investments in digital sectors , and  
the operations of online platforms. On a global scale, larger and relatively manufacture -oriented middle -
income countries are comparatively more restricted in digital trade. Other countries have a more open 
policy regime regarding digital trade and investments ; these  are mainly th e smaller , open , and  more 
services -oriented economies.  
 
Pakistan is the second highest exporter of ICT services from South Asia , behind India , with more 
than  US$1 billion of exports . Although export growth has been robust in the past few years, Pakistan’s  
world market share of computer services export s has remained low , at around 0.2 percent. With a stable 
base, low cost of operations, a growing domestic market , and a reasonably strong network of Pakistani

Official Use  workers across the world , the industry has the potential for more  grow th. However, skills mismatch  and 
poor infrastructure  problems , high tariff s and inefficient tax regime s, and poor perception as an IT 
investment destination due to economic and other factors , are holding the in dustry back.  
 
This report  analyses the recent trends  in the Pakistani IT sector and the obstacles confronted by IT 
firms . The obstacles faced by firms increase the costs of selling services and may reduce the capacity to 
compete both in the local market (Pakistan) as well as overseas (exports).  These obstacles include  direct 
costs generated by barriers to market entry , such as limits to foreign participation or limits to competition 
(monopolies). But they can also include obstacles due to infrastru cture deficiencies, geographical, cultural, 
and institutional differences, and/or obstacles imposed by regulatory measures. Among the latter obstacles , 
examples include difficulties in accessing information necessary to operate in a foreign market , or the 
predictability and stability of the business environment in a market  and may also include  the quality of the 
decision -making process and administrative  procedures of competent authorities. This report  uses a 
combination of data analysis, survey results , and private sector focus group  discussions  to better 
understand Pakistan 's IT performance , bottlenecks in this sector, and the  critical factors that may have 
contributed to this result. The survey was conducted on  782 IT firms located in different provinces. 
Surveyed firms include both exporters ( 534 firms ) and non -exporters ( 248 firms ), reflecting respectively 
the export competitiveness as well as domestic competitiveness of Pakistan's IT  services sector.  
 
Pakistan ’s digital policy regime is relatively restrictive.  According to the DTRI the  policy regime is 
above  the average  restrictiveness level of the  countries that cover the bulk of digital trade  in the world. 
That leaves scope for the country to tap into the opportunities that digital trade provides. Pakistan has been 
show ing an upward trend for digital and digital -intensive services (see Annex for a definition of concepts 
used in this report) , and firms do use and adopt foreign technologies either through licensing or through 
inward foreign direct investments. However, at present, Pakistan’s digital trade is below its potential based 
on its level of development in comparison to other peer countri es, due, in large part,  to its restrictive digital 
policy environment.  
 
To tap into the full potential of the sector,  Pakistan i authorities need to implement several  policy 
reforms . Removing trade obstacles on investments in digital sectors, digital goods , and services, as well 
as digital technologies, would serve the country’s interest by allowing firms to seize digital trade 
opportunities and create productivity effects. As the World Bank’s Pakistan@100 report laid out, the 
success of Pakist an’s future will depend on whether the country can overcome  the barriers to adopt the 
latest  technologies made available through growing FDI and  increase  openness to trade and technology 
ideas.  
 
The report is organized as follows . The following section pro vides a n overview of Pakistan’s digital 
trade and investments performance  and opportunities . The second section studies the digital trade policy 
framework in Pakistan . The third section looks at the enabling environment for digital trade and investment  
and the perception of the firms surveyed . The last section provides policy recommendations.

Despite progress in the digital space, there is scope for growth . The p ercentage of individuals using 
the internet almost doubled from 8 percent in 2010 to 15.5 percent in 2017 , the latest data available,  while 
the proportion of households with internet access increased fourfold ( Table 1 ). The improvement in access 
and u sage is a recent phenomenon, as 47 percent of the internet users went online for the first time between 
2012 and 2015 (UNCTAD 2017), coinciding partly with the introduction of 3G/4G technology. The 
number of subscribers of mobile broadband has soared from 1.4 million in FY2013 -14 to almost 76 million 
(as of December 2019), which constitutes 97.4 percent  of overall broadband (fixed and mobile) 
subscribers .14 However, there is still a long way to go. Only 37 percent of Pakistanis aged 15 -65 are aware  
of the i nternet ( LIRNEasia, 2018 ). Data from the Household Survey (2018/19) show that in urban areas, 
only 4.7 percent of those in the lowest quintile of income distribution had used the internet in the previous 
three months. The share climbs to 50 percent among t hose in the highest quintile – but still hint s at a 
substantial distance to universal access.15 Over the years , Pakistan’s ranking has worsened in the ICT 
Development Index ( IDI), published by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) , with other 
countries in the world progressing faster. Pakistan’s rank at 148 is the lowest of the major South Asian 
economies in terms of IDI (Figure 1  and Table A1 ).16

Official Use  IT and IT eS services  have grown into a moderately sized industry, comprising mostly locally owned 
firms. Official estimates vary regarding the exact size of the industry. The State Bank of Pakistan (2018) 
reports that the number of IT firms registered at the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan 
(SECP) was 4 ,600 in 2017 , while the Pakistan Software Export Board (PSEB) website states that there are 
4,464 companies and 3 ,579 call centers registered with them .17 The industry is primarily spread across 
three major cities  - Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad (Rahman et al. 2017, and Ignite 2014) and has 300,000 
professionals .18 According to a survey of 300 IT firms by the National ICT R&D fund (presently known 
as Ignite) under the Ministry of Information Techno logy and Telecommunications (MOITT), 14 percent 
of the firms had 50 or more employees, 17 percent had 25 -50 employees, and the rest had less than 25 
employees (Ignite 2014). The sector comprises mostly domestically owned firms with limited foreign 
operatio ns. According to Ignite (2014), 13 percent of surveyed firms were foreign , and of the top 10 
exporters, only one is foreign. However, there is a multinational  presence including  IBM, Oracle , and 
Cisco, among others.

amount would be an underestimate, since cash on delivery is believed to cover 60 percent of the total e -
commerce value in Pakistan (S BP 2018). As internet penetration increases in the country, e -commerce 
activity is expected to expand even more.  
 
The international and domestic markets are equal ly importan t. According to the Pakistan Software 
Houses Association (PASHA, the largest privat e sector association for the IT industry), about 53.8 percent 
of the revenue comes from the export market and the rest from the domestic market .22 Among the firms 
surveyed by  Ignite (2014), 30 percent served only in the local market, 25 percent only in th e export market, 
and the rest of the firms operated in both markets. The private sector is the leading consumer of IT services, 
as 97 percent of firms served the private sector while 66 percent served the public sector. According to the 
survey estimate, 22  percent of the domestic revenue of the IT industry was generated by serving the 
domestic IT sector, followed by education (8 percent) and banking (7 percent) (Ignite 2014).

The industry is active in mostly low -value segments. In exports, Pakistan primarily provides medium 
to low value -added software services , which includes enterprise planning, application development , and 
integration , while there is limited activity in product development. Low value -added services such as call 
centers lead the BPO segment with 90 percent of the export revenue in this segment stemming from these 
services . A small number of firms outsource serv ices in the banking, financial, insurance, healthcare , and 
energy industr ies, which may comprise  higher value -added services . Around 42.4 percent of freelancers 
in Pakistan are in software development , which constitutes about 10.5 percent of global freelan cers in 
software development, much higher than Bangladesh, Nepal , and Sri Lanka , but lower than India (Table

Exports  of IT services  have been thriving.  Since FY10, Pakistan’s ICT services exports grew at 10.8 
percent per annum from US$433 million to more than US$1 billion in FY2018 -19. The share of computer 
services  within ICT services export s increased from 44 percent of total ICT export s to 73 percent in FY19 , 
with an annual growth of 17.3 percent. In computer services, software consultancy services grew sharply 
by almost 32 percent from FY2009 -10 to FY2017 -18, whi le the growth of software export s was moderate 
at 12.6 percent ( Table 2 ). Though call center exports have been growing steadily, the export amount is

Official statistics do not capture the full export story . Industry experts believe that there is around 
US$1.5 billion worth of export s that are not captured in official statistics  - US$1 billion by SMEs  and 
US$0.5 billion by freelancers ( SBP 2019). More than half (52 percent) of Pakistan’s Telecommunication, 
Computer and Information Services export s in FY2018 -19 went to the United States, followed by the 
United Arab Emira tes (8.8 percent) and the United Kingdom (7 percent) ( Figur e 3). Among South Asian 
countries, Pakistan’s ICT service s export is second only to India, but by a considerable margin. However, 
within ICT exports, Pakistan ’s exports of computer services are low er than those from Sri Lanka  (Table 
A1).  
 
There is ample room for export s to grow.  Pakistan’s global  market share in computer services has been 
very small and relatively stagnant. The e xport of computer services was only 0.2 percent of total computer 
services export s in the world in 2018. Even if the informal export estimate of US$1.5 billion is considered, 
the world market share of Pakistan still stands at just 0.7 percent.

Pakistan’s export of digital services represents an increasing share of its overall export in services 
performed cross -border . Figure 4 shows that the percentag e of ICT services exports as a share of total 
services exports (left -axis) has been volatile yet  increasing. Likewise, looking at the broader definition of 
digital -enabled services which comprises not only computer and communication services, but also 
royalties and license fees and various other business services (right -axis), this share has also bee n 
increasing.24 Digital -enabled services are all sorts of services that are digitally delivered through the 
internet or are produced with the help of internet technologies. They are usually digital -intense but do not 
necessarily have to be ICT or computer services themselves. Moreover, Pakistan’s per capita exports of 
computer and communication services have  increased by 15 percent since 2005 . In contrast,  ICT services 
alone have  seen a huge increase of per capita exports of around 80 percent (both numbers based on the log 
change).

Pakistan’s ICT services exports have also increased in absolute numbers and have also been more 
successful than some in peer countries.  UNCTAD provides  numbers on trade development in ICT 
services for developing countries. This source confirms Pakistan’s favorabl e position regarding the exports 
over time in these services: Pakistan shows an upward pattern ( Figure 5, left-hand panel). Moreover, 
compared to various peers, Pakistan is doing relatively well. Together with Sri Lanka, the country shows 
a continuo us upward movement .25 Figure 5 (right -hand panel) repeats Pakistan 's ICT services exports in 
shares  of total exports  and places  them with its peers. Here too, Pakistan shows positive developments 
compared to Sri Lanka , and even compared to India , where ICT services ha ve taken up a lower share over 
time.26

Still, these positive developments need to be nuanced when looking at the broader picture in light of 
Pakistan’s level of development. That can be seen in Figure 6, in which the level of development , 
represented by GDP per ca pita, for all countries is plotted against the per capita ICT services exports (left -

Moreover, Pakistan’s market share in digital goods trade has been in decline since 2005. Pakistan’s  
share of ICT goods exports (as a percentage of total exports) has decreas ed from 0.51 in 2005 to 0.20 in 
2017.28 Moreover, imports of ICT goods as a percentage of total imports for Pakistan has  also been in 
decline from 8.70 in 2005 to 4.70 in 2017. This significant downward trend gives the impression that 
Pakistan has been less able to profit from positive spill -over effects that come with the imports of ICT 
goods and commodities. When expressi ng Pakistan’s ICT good s imports in terms of its per capita rate, the 
country shows a constant trend. However, the country’s per capita ICT goods exports decreased by 80 
percent between 2005 and 2017. Th is negative development warrants attention as it refle cts Pakistan’s 
limited trade competitiveness, which prevents the country from having access to up -to-date technologies 
embodied in goods that are necessary to increase competition and to find new areas of specialization, as 
outlined in the Pakistan@100 rep ort. 
 
B- TRADE AND INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES  
 
The startup ecosystem is evolving. Tech  entrepreneurship is on the ascendency in Pakistan with a 
growing number of startups, support organizations, and investors. In South Asia, Pakistan has the highest 
number of tech hubs (35) after India (Table A1). As of October 2019, there were 24 incubators and 
accelerators compared to only 2 in 2012, most of which are private sector led (Invest2Innovate 2019). 
Around 720 startups have been established since 2010, of  which 67 percent are active.29 Investment in 
startups has been growing.30 During 2015 -19, 82 startups raised funding of more than  US$165 million 
(Invest2Innovate 2019). However, securing financing remains a significant challenge. Pakistan is ranked

Bangladesh but below India and Sri Lanka.31   
 
Both the public and private sector support the scale -up of the startup ecosystem.  Both the federal and 
provincial  governments support the startup ecosystem. For example, the Government of Punjab established 
the Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB) under which the technology incubator Plan9 was set up 
in 2012. Between 2016 -18, Ignite, under the purview of MOITT,  established five National Incubation 
Centers under public -private partnership in Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar, and Quetta. The federal 
government also started approving licenses for private equity and venture capital firms in 2017. As of May 
2018,  there were two private equity funds and two private equity companies registered with SECP.32 The 
private sector has also been playing a crucial role in promoting startups. Since their inception, private 
sector accelerator and incubator programs , such as I nvest2Innovate and Nest I/O , graduated about 191 
startups .33 In partnership with the federal government, Facebook launched its first innovation lab in April 
2019. Google Developer Groups and Google Business Groups organize regular events in Pakistan’s major 
cities.  Local chapters of global initiatives like Startup Grind, Startup Weekend are also active in Pakistan. 
The ecosystem is also being strengthened by increased coworking spaces made available by established 
brands such as Daftarkhwan, CoLab, the Hive, and Kickstart.34 
 
The industry has a stable foundation and  the necessary ingredients to take off. Pakistan produces 
more than 20,000 engineers and IT graduates each year, most of whom can speak English.35 The increasing 
number of freelancers indicates the availability and quality of the IT workforce. There are ex perienced 
professionals available to firms at all levels, including programmers, IT managers, and so on. Thirty -one 
percent of the surveyed firms were in operation for more than 10 years, while 39 percent of firms had 1 -5 
years of experience indicating a g ood mixture of experienced and upcoming firms. The necessary 
infrastructure exists,  with 14 IT parks and improved telecom and internet infrastructure.36 
 
Pakistan is a cost -effective outsourcing location compared to other countries in the world. According 
to the Kearney Global Services Location Index 2019, Pakistan is the third most financially attractive 
location for outsourcing IT -enabled services in South Asia, just after Sri Lanka and Bangladesh and fifth 
in the world, mainly due to low labor cost. The average hourly rate of a software developer is US$25 -30, 
which is at par with Bangladesh and Sri Lanka but lower than India (Table A1). Pakistan’s operational 
cost in the low value -added BPO segment is 60 percent lower than that of the Philippines, the lar gest 
supplier of BPO services in the world.37 
 
The Pakistani diaspora in the IT industry of the United States can be an asset for the sectors’ 
expansion. In the United States, for example,  there are around 13,000 Pakistani origin workers in Silicon 
Valley ,38 and Pakistan can leverage this strong network. Pakistani -Americans have already played a role 
in the advancement of the industry , by acting as investors and setting up firms utilizing their networks in 
the United States. This process can continue to devel op the industry. Returning ex -pats can bring

Growing digital consumption in Pakistan holds much promise for the sector. With a population of 
more than  212 million in 2018 and increasing internet penetration, the digital market is growing in 
Pakistan. More than 20 percent of smartphone owners in Pakistan use their devices to purchase goods and 
services online every month.40 Daraz, a popular online market place, has more than 15,000  sellers each 
month, and more than 50 percent of their orders come from locations outside the big cities of Karachi, 
Lahore, and Islamabad, reflecting the spread of e -commerce in the semi -urban and rural areas.41  
 
Pakistan is also improving on digital e -government services. Pakistan progressed in the United Nation’s 
E-Government Development Index, driven mainly by the improvement in the availability of online 
services ( Table 3 ). Efforts to digitize the government are being observed both at the federal and local level. 
PITB implemented more than 270 ICT -related projects since FY2011 -12, such as the digitization of land 
records and revenue system s, and launch of an e-Vaccs program to monitor vaccinators through a mobil e-
based app.42 Sindh started an online collection of sales taxes.43 Digitization of sectors such as agriculture, 
education, energy, and others as envisaged in the government’s Digital Pakistan Policy 2018 can create 
more opportunities for the local entrepr eneurs in the IT industry. Developing solutions for the local market 
would help firms gain experience and maturity and help them expand globally.

Official Use  II. DIGITAL TRADE POLICY FRAMEWORK IN PAKISTAN  
 
The spectrum of digital trade policies is broad.  It not only  encompasses a wide range of complementary 
and interrelated “flows” of investments, goods, services , and data, but also factor s such as competition 
policy and IPR. Given the fact that digital technologies are embedded in a wide variety of tradable  items  
(i.e., goods, services , and data), digital trade policies should  be formulated broadl y (Table 4).44 Above all, 
there are many complementarities between these different flows in the digital economy , and hence 
restricting one part of digital trade would most likely generate ripple effects further down the digital supply 
chain. An open policy regime for digital trade , therefore,  helps countries to reap the full economic benefits 
through the use of digi tal technologies brought in by investments and associated digital goods, services , 
and data.

A- PAKISTAN POLICY FRAMEWORK  
 
Pakistan ’s digital policy framework is relatively restricted. The Digital Trade Restrictiveness Index 
(DTRI)  is an indicator that measures appl ied digital restrictions for ICT goods, digital services, 
investments , and standards in digital sectors , and the cross -border flow and domestic use of data.45 Pakistan 
is somewhat more restrict ive than the average level of restrictiveness , marked by the dotted horizontal line 
in Figure 8, which is based on the full sample of countries , but less restrictive than some of its peers . 
Countries such as Russia, India , and China are much more restricte d in digital trade than Pakistan. Only 
the Philippines have a level of restrictiveness in digital trade that is below the average.  
 
44 The DTRI covers a wide range of policy restrictions that increase the cost for the firm, and t herefore digital trade. 
ECIPE’s DTRI follows in large part the set -up of the OECD’s STRI which later evolved into another index, DGSTRI, 
that covers all trade restrictions that are also covered by ECIPE’s STRI. ECIPE’s DTRI is larger in scope and some 
of the regulatory measures covered do not necessarily have a direct impact on international trade in services. Some 
measures affecting data policy may increase costs of digital trade but may also be necessary to address markets failure 
and achieve legitimate p olicy objectives , such as consumer protection and privacy. This index identifies elements 
that increase these costs. Reducing them requires a detailed analysis of the underlying policy objectives and rational e 
behind their imposition.  
45 It has been develop ed by the European Centre for International Political Economy (ECIPE) and covers digital trade 
policies in 64 countries.

Official Use   
Pakistan’s main digital trade policy obstacles are found in the area of Fiscal Restrictions and Market 
Access, whil e the establishment restriction s in digital sectors are relatively low. The DTRI is 
composed of four different clusters ( Table 4). (A) Fiscal Restrictions : tariffs and trade defense, taxation 
and subsidies, and public procurement; (B) Establishment Restrictions : FDI restrictions, restrictive IPR 
measures, competition policy, and business mobility; (C) Restrictions on Data : data policies, 
intermediate liability, and content access policies;  and (D) Trading Restrictions : quantitative  trade 
restrictions, standards in digital trade, and restrictions related to online sales and transactions (largely e -
commerce). Pakistan shows a level of restrictiveness that is substantially higher for fiscal restrictions, 
which includes market access restrictio ns on digital goods, as shown in Figure 8 (right -hand panel). The 
average level of restrictions in this area across countries is much lower.

B- POLICY CLUSTERS ANALYSIS  
 
Fiscal Restrictions  
 
Pakistan is particularly restrictive in the areas of tariffs and trade defense as well as taxation and 
subsidies, but not for public procurement for digital sectors. Pakistan appears in the top 5 list of 
countries most restricted for tariffs and trade defense, taxation, and subsidies policies , with countries such 
as Brazil, China, India, Nigeria, and Turkey. Some of these countries are Pakistan’s peers and score equall y 
restrictive. Pakistan still  applies an average MFN tariff rate of 9.7 percent on digital products, with peaks 
of 35 percent.  Moreover , tariffs dispersion is high adding to price distortions. Also, imports need to pay 
two additional duties, the regulatory  duty and the additional customs duty, that on average are 0.6 and 3.4 
percent, respectively, for this category of products ( Tables A2 and A3 ). The country also has an anti -
dumping measure in place on imports of phthalic anhydride (an input used to make PV C for cables) from 
India, Iran, Italy, Thailand, Brazil, China, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, and Hong Kong.  Furthermore, 
Pakistan does not apply its MFN tariff rates on imports from India.  
 
Restrictions in the areas of tariffs and trade defense , as well as taxation and subsidies,  matter a great 
deal for digital inputs. Even though digital trade currently tilts toward a focus on digital services, digital 
goods matter too. The hardware infrastructure , for instance , still consists of items ranging from cables and 
wires to more complex inputs such as optical fib ers, which are all physically delivered. All these inputs 
are needed for the production of many other digital services. Therefore, access to the best digital input

sectors using digital inputs intensively (Lopez -Gonzalez and Ferencz 2018). Moreover, digital sales and 
purchases also happen with the help of digital input commodities and services , which are used in sectors 
such as motor vehicles, computer manufacturing , and electrical equipment. This is particularly relevant in 
the context of the Covid -19 crisis, when digital inputs are crucial to continue producing while adhering to 
the social distan cing measures imposed by governments.  
 
IT and ITeS providers face significant challenges regarding the taxation regime .46 There are two 
related issues on taxation: a ) taxation policies; and b ) tax administration and practices (governance). 
This issue requires urgent attention from the authorities at the central and provincial levels. The private 
sector, in general , has identified this issue as the most crucial problem it currently faces.47 In the case of 
the services  sector , services and services providers are taxed at the provincial level, introducing significant 
distortion due to differences among tax rate s. A service  may be  taxed in one province, but not in another . 
There are also  different c riteria among the  provinces on when the tax need s to be paid , either at the moment 
of consumption or where the service rendered/ originated . Finally, there are overlaps with central 
government on certain taxes , which creat e an unnecessary high taxation burd en, a complex administration 
system , and greater uncertainty for service s providers , which, overall, fragment the domestic markets 
among provinces . This should be tackled as a priority to eliminate uncertainty, avoid fragmentation , and 
create a harmonized taxation regime which will efficiently generate the required revenues. The first matter 
to agree among authorities should be to have a common understanding on where the tax is due , to reduce 
uncertainty and avoid potential double t axation. Dealing with tax authorities cost s firms in terms of time 
and financial resources , and was identified by the private sector as one of the most challenging areas in 
their business, due , in part, to the complex nature of modern business models requi red by ICT/digital 
firms.48  
 
Establishment Restrictions  
 
Regarding establishment restrictions for digital sectors, Pakistan scores below the average and 
therefore is less restrictive than many of its peers. This is, in large part , due to the abolishment of all 
types of FDI restrictions in digital sectors such as telecommunications and  computer services. Also , 
Pakistan has a friendly regime when it comes to IPR restrictions but still has some restrictive measures in 
place. For insta nce, under the Copyright Ordinance of 1962, certain acts are not considered an infringement 
of copyright. Pakistan has only some copyright exceptions that include fair dealing for purposes of research 
or private study, criticism , or review. Further more , in Pakistan’s merger guidelines, the country identifies 
IPR as an entry barrier for other firms . Pakistan’s  guidelines hint at the negative effect of IPR on 
competition in view of increasing the costs for competitors and the quality of competing products. 
However, this issue is not taken up in the DTRI , as no complaints were  found regarding the application 
process for foreign applicants.  
 
A combination of economic, political, and other external factors make Pakistan less attractive to 
foreign IT investors. Pakistan ranks 37 (out of 50) in AT Kearney’s Global Services Location Index 2019, 
below India (1), Sri Lanka (25) and Bangladesh (32) ( Table A1), mainly due to a poor score in the business 
environment. Macroeconomic instability, together with security considerations, is a key reason for overall 
low foreign investment, and it is very low in the IT sector ( Figure 9). Furthermore, there is a  security risk

Figure 9. Net FDI Inflows in Pakistan  
  
 
Keeping low restrictions on FDI for digital sectors in Pakistan , such as telecommunications and 
information services , are vital for the country to profit from technology spill -over effects. 
International firms willing to invest in Pakistan  would be incentivized to share technologies if they  face a 
favorable investment regime . This way, perennial firms in the digital sect or can subsequently adopt new 
technologies. This is already happening in part in Pakistan, albeit weakly. In addition, many goods and 
services that international firms bring have embedded intellectual property. And as digital trade often 
implicates IPRs, p articularly copyrights and trademarks (Lopez -Gonzalez and Ferencz 2018), rules 
surrounding intellectual property would have to be set right and not too restrictive. This is particularly  
relevant for sectors such as entertainment with a high digital content  (i.e., books, films, etc.), but also other 
sectors such as social media, cloud computing , and other technical software -related services.  
 
Data restrictions  
 
Pakistan is only somewhat more restricted than average regarding data  policies , but still holds some 
restrictions related to content access. Pakistan’s overall policy framework regarding electronic data is 
relative ly open. However, although the country does  not have any full data localization requirement s, it 
nonetheless holds some restrictions. While  this may change over time , it is not yet explicit ly regulated in 
Pakistani law . 
 
Data can only be transferred to India if the transferor can justify such a transfer.  Other than that, 
there are  also some other minor restrictions in place  in Pakistan. Besides being regulated by contractual 
terms, data collected by banks, insurers, hospitals, defense establishments , and other "sensitive"

of the relevant regulator or similar entities, on a confidential basis. Additionally, in some instanc es, data 
cannot be transferred without the consent  of the relevant client/customer.  
 
Pakistan has significantly stricter data rules regarding conte nt access that are comparable with 
some of its peers , such as Thailand, Indonesia, India , and Russia. Pakistan appears to control foreign 
commercial services content to its domestic market , and the government has provided a mandate for 
filtering legal content. This makes the country above average in terms restrict iveness in this regard  and 
holds back foreign content that can enter Pakistan. This is a result of so -called “shut -down” that regi onal 
governments apply for foreign content and foreign online platform providers, which was also reported by 
UNCTAD (2017).50 Regarding the intermediate liability obligations that applied to online platforms, 
Pakistan does not have any burdensome restricti ons. It has a Safe Harbor framework that shield s them 
from liability from third parties. The country neither has user identity nor monitor requirements in place.  
 
An open policy regime regarding data is vital as it underpins the digital economy. Data as f low has 
exponentially increased in recent years. Data  underpins the digital economy as they are used to optimize 
supply chain management systems, electronic payment networks, and facilitate workings with contractors 
and input suppliers . Moreover, many newly emerging sectors, such as cloud computing, digital 
information services, or online platforms, thrive on the use of and cross -border flow of data. Recent studies 
have shown that restrictions on data flow hamper trade in services perfor med online.51 Moreover, 
restrictive rules on the domestic use of data , such as burdensome administrative and privacy regulations , 
hamper the opportunity to reap productivity gains by firms that are reliant on software technologies.52 
Restrictive policies r egarding data also appear to hold back the absorption of foreign technologies as a 
study by Ferracane and van der Marel (2019) shows for a group of Asian countries.  
 
Pakistan is currently planning to introduce regulatory changes to personal data protectio n. While 
an in-depth analysis  of the legislation goes beyond the objectives of this report, a three pillar s strategy 
should be followed. The first pillar should address the legitimate policy objectives pursued by the 
government. The second pillar should en sure that internationally recognized principles are considered, 
while a third pillar should encourage international cooperation to allow for the digital economy and trade 
to gr ow. Regarding the current proposal, several issues can be pointed out. First, the draft law requires 
additional clarity to ensure that both the law and its implementation are consistent with accepted principles. 
For example, the law applies conditions for transfer of critical personal data only, but what is critical 
remains undefined. Also, the law requires consent for the collection and use of data, but it remains unclear 
if this requirement will be more  burdensome  than necessary . Consent is also need ed when data is 
transferred abroad. Finally, to implement data localization requirements , data center s need  to be 
developed. It is unclear if data centers are a viable investment in developing countries due to the difficult 
requirements nece ssary for their operation.   
 
The law should aim to balanc e objectives.  Second, t he law should, on the one hand, aim to achiev e the 
legitimate policy objective, i.e., data and consumer protection, and on the other hand, allow data flow to 
promote high value -added services activities. In other words, regulations should avoid increasing input 
costs for firms, ultimately affecting th eir productivity. This can be achieved by  subscribing to general 
principles broadly accepted internationally , such as the OECD privacy principles guidelines,  the Council 
of Europe  Modernised Convention for the Protection of Individuals with Regard to the P rocessing of 
Personal Data  (Modernized Convention 108) , or from the Asia–Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC)

Official Use  forum.  Ultimately, a strong international ly recognize d regulatory regime will be required to allow for 
constructive cooperation between Pakistan an d its main trading partners. This will require a delicate 
balance of share responsibilities from both the data source country and the destination country. Also, it 
will require increasing levels of convergence on privacy protection requirements set by data  source 
countries and the protection standards offered by the data destination countries.53  
 
Trad e Restrictions  
 
Pakistan upholds some restrictions when it comes to importing digital services and maintains strict 
standards in digital trade.  Figure 10 shows that Pakistan is more restricted than most other countries 
regarding the trading restrictions summarized in Cluster D. These restrictions are found in the DTRI’s 
chapters related to quantitative trade restrictions and standards in digital trade. Rega rding the former, 
Pakistan prohibits the importation, sale, distribution, and transmission of films the government deems 
inconsistent with the country’s cultural values.  In 2017, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) imposed a 100  
percent  cash margin requiremen t on the import of certain consumer items, which included mobile phones 
and reception apparatus. This measure obliges importers to deposit the total amount of the transaction 
value in a commercial bank before the opening of an import letter of credit.  
 
Pakistan has also applied some restrictive rules and practices regarding digital product standards 
in telecommunication that appear to be discriminatory.  Although the technology department of the 
Ministry of Science and Technology in Pakistan sponsors and en courages public and private organizations 
in the standardization of products and services according to International Organization for Standardization 
(ISO), the country still holds discriminatory practi ces for some digital items from abroad. For instance, as 
part of Pakistan ’s product safety certification, the Telecom Act requires that telecom equipment should 
conform to the standards adopted by the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA). No terminal 
equipment can be directly or indirectly connected wi th the public switched network unless the PTA has 
approved it . The machines  required for testing terminal equipment s and network conditions also need  to 
be submitted  to the PTA  for approval. It is reported that such approval for a local manufacturer costs half 
as much  (5000 PKR, approx. US$48) than for a foreign one ( US$100).  Also, the private sector identified 
security -related measures as unnecessarily burdensome for the authorization of specific equipment used 
in the ICT/digital services environment (see  Box 1 , below ).  
 
The quality certification status of the industry needs to improve. To grow the market potential , firms 
need to show that they can meet the global standards by  obtaining internationally recognized standard 
certifications and accreditations . These indicate  the capability and capacity of IT firms and their ability to 
deliver quality products and services promptly .54 
 
Although not always applied, Pakistan has some regulatory restrictions and practi ces regarding 
encryption standards.  Pakistan neither  require s mandatory encryption standards that deviate from the 
international, nor den ies any recognition of international encryption standards . The country nonetheless 
maintains  some restrictive practi ces. Officially, Pakistan requires entities using encryption and 
cryptography services to obtain accreditation from the Electronic Certification Accreditation Council, 
which falls under the Ministry of Information Technology. In practice, this requirement i s not consistently 
enforced. For example, WhatsApp is widely used in Pakistan, despite the company’s April 2016 
 
53 Mattoo and Metzler (2018) and World Bank (2020).  
54 Government of Pakistan, (2014). Government of Pakistan, (2014). The empirical literature, Gregory, Stanley and 
Tenev (2009) and Bhattacharjee and Chakr abarti (2015), attributes certifications as a key factor  to the success of the 
Indian software industry. Also see Couto and Fernandez -Stark, (2019) for discussion on the importance of 
certification in this industry more broadly.

maker of BlackBerry mobile devices, faced sc rutiny from the government regarding its use of encryption. 
In 2015, the national telecom carriers were ordered to cease offering services that route email through 
BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES).  
 
Maintaining the least burdensome digital standards in P akistan favors the tradability of goods and 
services while allowing smaller firms to participat e in exporting and importing. Generally, strict 
standards for firms to enter the market, or even diverging standards across countries, pose a fixed cost 
burden f or a firm willing to export. Standards for goods and services are set to guarantee quality and 
achieve legitimate policy objectives that otherwise the market may fail  to provide . But  standards can also 
be designed or applied  in a way so that it becomes more burdensome  than necessary and hold back the 
presence of exporters in foreign markets (see a study on restrictive SPS measures as trade barrier by 
Fontagné et al. 2015). If so, restrictive standards in digital sectors in Pakistan will hold back the best 
available digital goods that, as explained above, are used as inputs into other productive sectors.55  
 
C- PAKISTAN AND PEERS COUNTRIES  
 
Compared to its direct comparator countries, Pakistan places itself as more restricted than the 
average only regarding fiscal restrictions in digital trade. Pakistan scores above the average level of 
restrictiveness across its peers with regards to fiscal restrictions in digital trade, as shown by the dashed 
lines in Figure 10  (left-hand panel). Even though some peers have higher levels of restrictiveness, 
compared to the Philippines, Vietnam , and Malaysia, Pakistan’s  restrictiveness appears high. That is n ot 
the case for the other areas of the DTRI. For instance, even though  Pakistan has some quantitative 
restrictions and strict standards in place, on the whole , the country applies a level of restrictiveness that is 
lower than average (right -hand panel). Th is conclusion also holds for Pakistan’s policies regarding data 
and investments.

Official Use  Restrictive policies are likely to explain , to some extent , Pakistan’s limited success in technology 
adoption and receiving positive spillovers from investments in the digital sector. As pointed out in 
Figure 11 , restrictive policies are negatively correlated with the extent to which firms adopt new 
technologies . A higher level of digital trade restrictiveness is associated with lower levels of availability 
of the latest technologies as well as the capacity of firms to absorb digital technologies and the extent to 
which technolog y transfer takes place (left -hand panel). Pakistan is placed below the fitted values line, 
indicating that its capacity to adopt technologies is lower than what one would expect based on its digital 
policy framework. This may suggest  that other factors als o play an important role , such as the strength of 
local institutions such as standard -setting authorities, regulatory agents dealing with the 
telecommunication s market, or institutions responsible for the innovation ecosystem on which digital 
developments are dependent , and the availability of good quality skills used in digital sectors (see  below  
for detailed discussion ).

Reducing fiscal restrictions in digital trade will foster the competitiveness of digital goods and 
services. As described above, Pakistan’s success in digital goods trade is more limited than in digital 
services trade. At the same time, Pakistan is relatively more restricted regarding its tariffs and trade 
defense , as well as taxation and subsidies , and standards in digital trade. The high level of restrictiveness 
in this area may , therefore,  play a role in the low ability of P akistan i firms to adopt new technologies , as 
shown in Figure 1 1 (right -hand panel). This figure predicts that for Pakistan, lowering trade restrictions 
may help companies to absorb more modern  technologies. However, the variability between high and low 
technology absorbers in both panels is high, which demonstrates  that even though policy restrictions may 
help, policy restrictiveness is unlikely to be the sole determinant for explaining Pakistan’s limited success 
in absorbing digital technologies.  
 
Given Pa kistan’s relatively higher level of restrictions in digital trade and technology compared to 
other non -peer countries, it may also explain why the country has a relatively lower share of firms 
introducing new goods and services. Pakistan’s performance rega rding the percentag e of firms doing 
innovative activities is in line with some peers but is overall low compared to many other countries ( Figure

Official Use  12). Part of the explanation may  be again the relatively higher levels of restrictions in digital trade. The 
panels of Figure 12 show the share of firms producing new goods and services with the full DTRI 
(covering the full range of digital trade restrictions ) as well as restrictions for Cluster D (Trading 
restrictions).  Again, although other factors may play a role, Pakistan’s fiscal restrictions in digital goods 
and services , as well as its strict rules regarding digital standards,  may help explain lower innovation 
activities. A similar adverse line is also visible when plotting the index for Cluster C instead, which covers 
data restrictions in which Pakistan has some limitations.

D- POLICY BARRIERS FOR EXPORTERS  
 
According to the survey conducted among exporting firms the  vast majority of exporters, 65 percent, 
in the IT  industry have only a few export markets (less than five). Less than 15 percent of the firms 
included in  the survey have more than 10 export markets ( Table 5, column 6). Firms located in Karachi 
have the larger s hare of the small number of destination countries, followed by firms located in Quetta and 
Lahore. Larger firms have a higher number of destination markets . They also have a larger percentage of 
firms with foreign investment. W hereas in the case of medium and small firms, destination markets are 
much more concentrated , and the number of firms with foreign ownership is much lower, 11 and 4 percent, 
respectively . More than half of the firms has exported for less than five years, and almost 80 percent l ess 
than 10 years ( Table 5, column 7). The youngest firms are located in Peshawar, Quetta , and Islamabad. 
Most exporting firms do not have any foreign ownership or investments in their company, nor do they 
form part of a bigger foreign parental company in the form of a subsidiary  (Table 5, columns 4 and 5).  
This is similar to firms regardless of their location.

To tap into continued ICT services export growth and to expand exports in ICT goods, foreign 
investments for Pakistan in digital sectors are of great importance.  FDI is an important vehicle for 
firms  to profit from positive spill -over effects . These spill -over effects enable domestic firms to learn  and 
adapt to new technologies that are being brought in by multinationals – especially in digital sectors. With 
these  new technologies, firms can develop and innovate new goods and services to export. However, FDI 
in digital sectors is limited in Pakistan  (McKenna, Rocha , and Varela 2020) . ICT -related investments 
(mainly in the telecommunication s sector) represent a shar e of 13 percent in total FDI received between 
2003  and 2015, and if we include digital -enable d services such as finance, the number only extends to 19 
percent. This small share of digital investments may hamper Pakistan’s upgrading to more advanced digital  
services exports and contribute to its decreasing digital goods performance. The WEF reports that although 
firms are able to absorb new technologies , Pakistan ’s performance has not improved since 20 10. On a 
scale between 1 (no technology adoption) and 7 ( extensive technology adoption), Pakistan’s trend is 
stagnant  (Figure 13, left-hand panel ).

Official Use  Figure 13. Technology Adoption Through FDI in Pakistan (2017)  
  
Source: author’s calculations;  WEF. The WEF indicators are derived from its annual survey. The survey is used to 
measure concepts that are qualitative in nature or for which internationally comparable statistics are not available 
for enough countries.  
Note: The grey line of the technology adoption index from the WEF measure the extent to which firms adopt technologies from 
abroad or from other sectors and companies. The red line measures the availability of these technologies in the economy. The 
dashed line i ndicates the technology adoption from FDI/international companies.  
 
That said, when disentangling Pakistan’s fairly constant rate of technology adoption by firms and 
looking at its sub -components, it seems that technology transfer through FDI is actually improving 
(Figure 13, right -hand panel). The three sub -indexes that build up the WEF’s full index of technology 
adoption has been normalized to zoom into Pakistan’s specific trends in technology adoption. At the outset, 
although there was a small decline i n 2016, overall , a positive trend is found regarding the technology 
spillovers associated with FDI for Pakistan. That cannot be said , however , for all firms in the country . 
Figure 13 also shows that firms lack access to the latest technologies, which in Pa kistan is also adopted 
on a limited scale. Yet some improvement on the sub -indicators seem s to have taken place in recent years.  
 
There are also specific obstacles IT  services firms in Pakistan face in the foreign market when 
exporting.  These, in most part , relate to the regulatory requirements that exist in export markets, which 
may, therefore, form an entry barrier to the market. However, most of the obstacles have a trade facilitation 
nature. That is, most obstacles in the export markets are related to c ompliance costs when entering the 
market, such as work permit regulations or entry visa requirements. The existing visa regimes faced by 
Pakistani businesspersons and IT professional s abroad is particularly complex. Given the importance of 
the temporary mo vement of persons to build relations, and develop and implement projects, the 
cumbersome and restrictive visa regime discourages their travel to and from Pakistan for business 
purposes. Furthermore, in addition to these  visa regimes, there is a security risk perception that work s 
against Pakistan, making foreigners reluctant to travel to Pakistan, thereby making it difficult for Pakistani 
companies to attract business from abroad (Couto and Fernandez -Stark 2019). Visa restriction  is the single 
most crucial item identified by Pakistani exporters that report this factor as an obstacle, as shown in 
Figure s 16. To tackle this limitation  one option for Pakistan is to pursue a multi -prong approach which 
could combine bilateral arrangements as well negot iations of deep trade agreements which can include  
provisions  to facilitate the temporary movement of businesspersons  (Mattoo  and Carzaniga 2003 ; Saez 
2013) .

Official Use  Other severe obstacles in the export market reported by firms are compliance costs, other regulat ory 
requirements of a general nature, and required investment costs that should be made in the export 
market  (see section below) . Regulatory predictability, timeframes , and applicability of regulations in 
foreign destinations are less of a problem for Pakistan i exporters.  For exporting IT services firms, senior 
management dedicate less than 20 percent of their time on c ompliance with rules and regulations in 
Pakistan (i. e., more than 50 percent of their respondents), which in fact , on average , represents 20 percent 
cost burden when expressed as part of their sales.  
III. PAKISTAN’S ENABLING ENVIRONMENT FOR DIGITAL TRADE AND 
INVESTMENT  
 
Infrastructure and skills constrain the supply capacity of the digital trade sector . Although reducing 
restrictive policies is an important factor in helping Pakistan to increase its digital trade performance, only 
so much can be done if the enabling environment is subpar. For instance, digital infrastructure is an 
important factor in creating a thriving and predictable digital trade environment. In that regard, Pakistan’s 
electricity performance is still lagging in many respects (and digital trade performance and technology is 
highly dependent o n digital infrastructure). The World Bank’s Enterprise Surveys report that around 75 
percent of firms identif y electricity as a major constraint and that 81 percent of firms experience electrical 
outages. Moreover, firms report that the average losses due to electrical outages as a percentage of annual 
sales are around 34 percent . Sixty -one percent of IT firms surveyed identify electricity as a major obstacle 
to growth.  
 
A- HUMAN CAPITAL AND SKILLS ENDOWMENTS  
 
Improved human capital and intellectual property protection is needed for technology innovations 
which can help  Pakistan in developing novel digital goods and services. Currently, Pakistan has one 
of the lowest scores when it comes to quality in  mathematic s and science education compared to peer 
countries in  Figure 14 (left-hand panel). Quantitative and science skills are an essential factor in 
developing and integrating technologies. Although Pakistan is not the worst regarding its general 
educational atta inment, there is a lot to be desired in improving quality of education in science and 
math ematics,  and availability of research and training services.  
 
Besides human capital, the protection of intellectual property is another element on which Pakistan 
can make  improvements. On this item, too, the country’s score is relatively low compared to peers (right -
hand panel). The low achievement of these enabling factors for Pakistan is strongly correlated with the 
extent companies spend on R&D, and which most likely explains Pakistan's lower -than-its-potential 
position regarding the introduction of new services and good s and, in turn, digital trade. Also, IT firms 
have identified human capital and IPR as significant obstacles for future growth. For 64 percent o f non -
exporter s and 66 percent of exporter firms this is a major obstacle. For example, among the issues 
mentioned by firms are long delays in processing requests, implementation/enforcement, and 
trust/capacity of agencies responsible for management of IPR s (see Box 1 for example s of the main issues 
raised during focus group interviews, and Table 9  below). Looking forward, for both data protection issues 
and strong IPR protection, management will be critical for the grow th and development of digital trade.56 
 
 
56 WIPO (2019) compiles compared indictors which illustrate capacity constraints in managing IPRs. For instance, 
Pakistan has 9 patent examiners, in contrast New Zealand has 46. In the case of trademarks, these figures are 6 and 
36 examiners, respectively. I n 2018, New Zealand granted 1,740 patents compared with 265 in Pakistan, on average 
the overall process takes in total 20.6 and 54 months, respectively, including both first office and final office actions.

The quality and employability of graduates are not up to the mark.57 In general, across industries, 
employers are dissatisfied with the skill s and quality of fresh graduates in Pakistan (Naqeebz Consulting 
2018). According to the Government of Pakistan (2014), 23 percent of the surveyed firms reported 
inadequate quality of graduates as a challenge for industry growth.  While graduates from top universities, 
such as Lahore University of Management Sciences  (LUMS) , National University of Sciences and 
Technology (NUST) , which are about  1,000 each year, are categorized as 100 percent employable by the 
industry, the story is  different for the lower -ranked institutes. High value -added product development firms 
find only 10 percent of the graduates from lower -tier universities employable, while it is 50 percent for 
lower -end software services firms (Couto and Fernandez -Stark 20 19). Lack of contemporary programming 
skills and weak English are identified as major drawback s, stemming from lack of qualified teachers and 
modern curriculum at all levels of education (Couto and Fernandez -Stark 2019 ; SBP 2018 ; Ignite  2014) . 
 
There are s ignificant differences among exporter and non -exporter firms.  Among exporters, 74 
percent of respondents consider s hortage of skilled  employees in Pakistan as an obstacle to their 
businesses.  Also , among non -exporters, 63 percent consider that skills short age is an obstacle to their 
business, and among them 48 percent think it is a severe obstacle (scale 4 and 5 of the responses).  Also, 
among non -exporters there are no significant differences among size of firms ( large 62, medium 68, and 
small 62 percent, respectively). Finally, regarding the differences among cities, firms located in Quetta 
and Peshawar have the highest percentage of respondents that consider skills shortage as an obstacle, 77 
and 75  percent , respectively. (With Karachi and Lahore  a significant 59 and 66 percent , respectively .)  
 
 
57 According to representatives from the private s ector, employable graduates are around 25  percent  of the total while 
the rest require training, additional skills , and certifications.

  Box 1. ICT Enabling Environment  
During roundtable meetings with services exporters, one group conducted an in -depth interview on the factors 
inhibiting exports with respect to the enabling environment. Examples of factors as part of the enabling 
environment are the institutional quality of governments, skilled labor force, or the level of corruption.  
The roundtable in Islamabad showed that there is some concern  over the extent of seamless  data flow in 
Pakistan, i.e., the stability of data latency.  However,  this issue is not relevant for most companies as they do  
not rely on high volumes of data, but for some, such as gaming or cloud computing, it is pertinent . Otherwise, 
broadband coverage and speed were assessed as good. A further issue raised was the lack of a good workspace.  
In Lahore, the roundtable showed a concern that the tax authorities provide little transparency as to what rights 
and obligations there are for firms. More generally, there was frustration about how much bureaucracy one 
needs to go through before doing business. Moreover, public procurement rules work against new innovative 
firms: only firms older than 10 years are eligible to bid . In the case of innovative younger firms, bidding firms 
collaborate but often appropriate their innovative technologies. This could be prevented by setting strong er 
rules.  
On a broader  scale, the underlying problem in Pakistan is that intellectual property is not protected enough. 
Examples of the private sector concerns include : a) while there are laws protecting IPRs implementation and 
enforcement remain a problem; b ) from a user point of view, there is lack of information on the procedures and 
trust in the sy stem that is responsible for protecting IPRs. Registration p rocedure s are long and non -transparent, 
for instance, trademarks and copyrights; and c ) protection of undisclosed information (trade secrets). In this 
case, the problem deals with difficulties of protecting against unfair competition, for example, from employees 
who move to new jobs , and misused commercial information, data, and proprietary information.  
In Karachi, the discussion revealed that , first, skills are a problem (see below), then the avai lability of 
workspace and the general ease of doing business, and then as a fourth factor, the international payment issues 
(also see below). Further concerns arose with respect to Pakistan’s image abroad. Much work can be done by 
the government to improve  a foreign importer’s view on the country , which  often prevents them from doing 
business straight away. Firms in Pakistan should also be more encouraged to adopt technologies, even though 
they may be foreign.  
Several enabling -related factors came out as c onsistent concern s for exporters across the three cities , including  
the weakness of the Ministry of Trade to understand the IT  sector. Bureaucrats have no proper knowledge of 
the functioning of digital services firms and their trade. It’s unclear how they’ re taxed, and there is confusion 
about whether firms in the IT  sector belong in the category as telecom companies or  as IT services exporters . 
Although the skill set s among workers in Pakistan are relatively good, universities would have to make more 
efforts to prepare students for a job in the IT  sector. Not all skills, in particular , the more complex IT  skills, 
match with the needs of digital services firms. Other sk ills, such as web develop ment , are easier to find. 
However, given the general level of education, this should  not be a major challenge.  
The international payment system  in Pakistan also raises concerns . Firms have difficulties opening a US $ 
account to pay  firms or trading partners, wh o often obligate them to pay in US $. Besides, cross -border payments 
are slow and take weeks to send and receive money.  
A final issue that was raised is that some exporters , who depend on social media for finding clients abroa d, face 
difficulty in  exporting. The Government of Pakistan can shut down social media platforms by blocking content 
access, which then prevents  small exporters do ing business.

B- INFRASTRUCTURE AND INPU TS: AVAILABILITY , QUALITY , AND AFFORDABILITY  
 
Although the basic infrastructure is available, it needs to improve for the IT sector to reach  the next 
level.  There is a shortage of IT -ready office space in major cities such as Lahore and Islamabad , and 
insufficient  coworking spaces for small companies and freelancers.58 Although there has been an 
improvement in the availability of bandwidth, the internet speed of fixed broadband (download speed of 
9 Mbps as of October 2019) is the lowest in South As ia (Table A1). In addition, the cost of the internet 
(monthly broadband subscription) is the highest of South Asian countries (Table A1). The technology 
parks do not address all the requirements of offshore services companies and are not affordable to smal l 
companies.59 The r eliability of power supply is an issue for firms across different sectors (World Bank 
2019). Online payment infrastructure is inadequate ; around 34.7 percent of firms cite poorly working 
online payment system s as one of the top three ch allenges in conducting e -commerce business in 
Pakistan .60 The absence of internationally recognized payment gateway s, such as PayPal , hampers cross -
border payments, creating an additional burden for freelancers as well as entrepreneurs (Couto and 
Fernandez -Stark 2019).  
 
The survey conducted among exporter s shows that the two most important obstacles identified by 
firms are the electricity shortages in Pakistan and the general IT -related infrastructure . The latter  
includes the country’s telecom net work market as well as ICT  good s that are necessary for producing and 
exporting IT  services. These two factors, in addition to various others, are related to Pakistan’s enabling 
environment. The next two most significant obstacles that firms face in Pakist an are regulatory in nature 
(see discussion above) . These are insufficient IPR protection in Pakistan and the entry of foreign 
competitors in export markets. The former is something that Pakistan policymakers can change in the 
short -term domestically . In c ontrast,  a change in the latter would also depend on policymakers in the export 
markets. Interestingly, other obstacles that could potentially be alleviated with the help of regulatory 
policies are of a more general nature. Obstacles such as exchange rate fluctuations and information on 
foreign markets (which forms a  critical  fixed cost factor for firms to export), as well as access to finance , 
are not necessarily IT -industry -specific factors. In fact, these are long -standing items that are often 
mentioned in any survey as a constraint for firms to do business. Finally, other factors mentioned as 
obstacles to export ing IT services in Pakistan are the lack of affordable workspaces in the country, 
changing demand patterns , and rising wages. Interestingly, risi ng wages form a more significant  obstacle 
for the IT  sector than shortages of skilled employees in Pakistan.  
 
Services exports depend on the availability, quality, and affordability of other services . Services 
inputs include professional services, utilities, such as electricity, and IT -related infrastructures, such as 
telecom services and network. Table 6 summarizes the survey result by showing the share of exporters 
that assess the particular service in question as poor, in terms of its availability, quality, and affordability. 
The survey shows that exporting firms suffer from the poor quality of utilities and professional serv ices 
such as accountants, lawyers, and consultants. For 23 percent of firms in Pakistan, the availability of 
professional services is considered to be poor. In comparison, 32 and 31 percent of the firms identify the 
quality and affordability of professiona l services, respectively, as poor . Interestingly, IT -related 
infrastructure is more an availability and quality issue rather than an affordability issue. The sheer lack of 
these IT -infrastructural services, including telecom network services, is evaluated by exporters as 
problematic.

The low affordability of utility services is most likely related to the electricity shortages experienced 
by firms in Pakistan . Firms need to cover these shortages by acquiring in -bought generators , which makes 
electricity mo re expensive. A relative ly higher share of firms respond ed that the costs of  these real estate 
services are too high compared to their quality. But there are significant differences among provinces as 
well as among IT firms , as illustrated in Table 6 . IT infrastructure -related obstacles vary among provinces.  
For firms located in Lahore, Peshawar, Quetta, and other cities, the availability of IT -related infrastructure 
is a much more severe obstacle than in Karachi and Rawalpindi . At the same time,  quality is sues are more 
severe in Quetta. Affordability related matters, on the other hand , are relatively similar across provinces. 
Finally, the importance of these obstacles does not significantly differ depending on the size of firms.  
 
Office/working spaces affordability is a comparatively severe problem . Among the firms that identify 
office /working space as poor, affordability is a more significant constraint. Again, there are significant 
differences across provinces, with Lahore and Rawalpindi/Islamabad identified as having  the most severe 
affordability problems . At the same time,  firms loc ated in Quetta consider availability and quality as the 
main problems. Finally, large firms identify quality and affordability as the most significant problems. 
Table 6  shows that among the firms that identified poor utilities as a significant constraint, there are 
relatively minor differences at the provinc ial level, except for Quetta and Peshawar . In the case of Lahore, 
both quality and affordability are relatively more severe problems compared to other major cities. For 
large firms, availability, quality , and affordability are relatively more important problems than for small 
and medium -sized firms.  
 
The quality and affordability of professional services matter relatively more for small and medium -
sized firms.  Table 6  shows that the availability of profe ssional services is perceived as a relatively similar 
issue for firms, regardless  of their size. But for small and medium firms, access to and affordability of 
professional services, as well as quality -related matters, are relatively more relevant issues c ompared with 
large firms. Table 6  also shows that quality is an important problem for firms operating in Lahore and 
Rawalpindi/Islamabad. At the same time, the availability of professionals is a significant issue for firms 
in Quetta and Peshawar.

C- REGULATORY GOVERNANCE AND IT AND ITES FIRMS  
 
Surveyed f irms identified domestic regulatory issues as important constraints to grow th. Regarding 
the overall regulatory environment, Figure 15 reports that the  obstacles for the current operation of 
Pakistan ’s IT services firms are mainly related to regulatory timeframes and transparency of regulatory 
rules and requirements, which typically relate to an institutional issue of regulators . Regulatory compliance 
was also identified by firms as an important constraint . Table 7  reports the perception of firms regarding 
compliance -related matters ( Box 2 provides some example s from private sector focus group interviews). 
Forty percent of non -exporting firms identified understanding regulations and timeframe s for decisions as 
significant constraints, while 37 percent considered regulatory requirements themselves as a significant  
problem. There are important differences among firms depending on their location. S enior management 
seem s to spend more time dealing with regulatory compliance (33 percent) in Pakistan and it takes up more 
than 20 percent of their time (about 56 percent o f respondents). In terms of costs, compliance represents 
about 24 percent of total sales  for non -exporting firms , which is higher than for exporters . In the case of 
firms in Peshawar, this percentage reach es about 75, while for Islamabad and Lahore it is 60 and 66 percent , 
respectively . For medium -sized firms, 64 percent estimate that between  1 and 40 percent of total senior 
management's time was spent on dealing with  regulatory compliance.

Table 8  provides additional information on the importance of regulatory obstacles according to 
location and fi rms’ size  for exporters in the destination markets . The data provide that , for large firms, 
regulatory obstacles are relatively more important than for medium and small  firms. This can be explained 
by the fact that larger firms are the biggest exporters an d are therefore likely to face these restrictions more 
than smaller firms. In terms of location, firms in Karachi perceive regulatory obstacles, across all the 
dimensions examined, as relatively more important than firms in other cities, except in Quetta. In general, 
compliance costs are perceived as the most onerous regulatory obstacles together with regulatory 
requirements.   
 
 
 
 
 
 Box 2. Regulatory Environment  and Governance : Some Examples  
During focus group interviews performed in Islamabad, Lahore , and Karachi, IT firms provided examples of the 
constraints and regulatory issues that they confront. Firms confront several challenges in terms of the regulatory 
environment. Those challenges span a significant number of different topics .  
i. For licenses, the private sector must register with PSEB, SECP, FBR, and SBP. While the registration 
processes have improved significantly in recent years (online registration has been introduced), the 
private sector considers that the licensing process  is still difficult, and licenses need to be renewed 
often. The renewal processes are unnecessarily long and require similar documents as for obtaining 
a de novo license. Firms need to work with lawyers and auditors  for this , which increases their 
operatin g costs. The timeframes of decision  making are very long. A single licensing could facilitate 
these processes significantly.  
ii. Tax laws are identified by the private sector as one of the most challenging areas. Particularly i n the 
case of export activities, firms confront a large number of difficulties since there is no clarity 
regarding applicable laws and regulations. For example, it is difficult for taxation authorities to 
understand IT/ITeS activities and how to interpret tax laws and regulations in the  technology 
environment.  
iii. Foreign exchange regulations are burdensome and complicated. Rules are designed more for the 
physical world instead of the new business models, which have been created by technological 
development. Some example s provided during the i nterviews included:  
i- Need to facilitate and simplify international transactions according to business need;  
ii- Entities like PayPal currently do not operate in Pakistan;  
iii- It takes 6 -7 days for international payments to be processed;  
iv- Intensive paperwork - in many cases hard copies are required to make international 
payments, and banks are not allowed to hold 35  percent  of their bank reserves in foreign 
currency as per the l aw.   
iv. Certification procedures  are cumbersome . Due to security considerations, the certification of 
equipment that is required for the operation of the IT/ITeS firms is complex and obsolete. Sometimes 
decisions are not made for lack of understanding, and b usiness opportunities are lost.  
v. The absence of a regulatory framework is also limiting the growth and development of the industry. 
For example, the lack of regulations in blockchain is limiting the adoption and potential development 
of this technology in Pakistan.

Official Use  For firms focusing on the domestic market in Pakistan (i.e., non -exporting firms), the most significant 
business obstacles are somewhat different and mostly relate  to the domestic enabling environment.  
Shortages of electricity are a problem in Pakistan for its IT  services firms, but so is economic uncertainty, 
in addition to corruption.61 Only after those issues  does the broader IT -related infrastructure in Pakistan 
become an obstacle for domestic firms. In the previous discussion, this latter point was the most important 
factor  for exporters to stay competitive. Given that domestic firms are less competitive in the f irst place 
(because they are not as productive to be able to export), they see domestic institutions and utilities as bigger 
problems than insufficient IPR protection, entry of foreign competitors in foreign markets , or affordable 
workspaces. Regarding the  services inputs that are assessed as poor, it  is mainly the affordability of utilities 
and working space that forms a problem, which is similar in the case of exporting firms. Quality that is 
assessed as poor is particularly an issue concerning  utilities (including its availability) and technology 
infrastructure.

Table 9 shows  the importance of the obstacles to growth for non-exporting IT firms.  The importance 
of IPRs protection for firms located in Peshawar and Islamabad is particularly important , and remains 
essential  for firms in Karachi and Lahore. IPRs protection is import ant for all firms regardless of size. While 
IT infrastructure  and electricity are important for firms, there are significant differences in firms’ 
perception s depending on their locations. For 93 percent of firms in Quetta and 64 percent of firms in 
Karach i, electricity  infrastructure  is considered an important obstacle to their operation . In comparison,  in 
Lahore , for 33 percent of firms, electricity is an obstacle. In the case of small firms, 66 percent consider 
electricity -related problems an important problem . Still,  for 55 percent of medium and 50 percent of large 
firms , it is also perceived as an obstacle. In the case of IT infrastructure, for more than 70 percent of firms 
in Quetta and Islamabad, this issue is  considered to be an important obstacle to their business . In 
comparison,  in Karachi and Lahore , 54 and  39 percent of firms , respectively,  identify IT in frastructure  as 
an obstacle. For 59 percent of small firms, IT infrastructure is considered an important obstacle , while less 
than 50 percent of medium and large firms perceive this as an important obstacle.    
 
61 Interestingly, for IT exporters, economic uncertainty in Pakistan seems to be a much less significant obstacle to 
their busi ness.

for 47 percent of firms , workspace affordability is considered an obstacle, and this is in general the case for 
all cities, except Peshawar. For large and small firms, this remain s an important limitation as well.

Domestic competitiveness and productivity depend on availability, quality, and affordability of other 
services required to produce services . Services inputs include professional services, utilities, such as 
electricity, and IT -related infrastructures, such as telecom services and network. Table 10 summarizes the 
information regarding input services that support non -exporting IT and IT -enabled services. For 17 percent 
of firms in Pakistan, the availability of professional services is poor, but 27 and 31 percent of the firms 
identify quality and affordability of professional services as poor. A higher percentage of firms in Lahore 
and Is lamabad identify the quality and affordability of professional services as poor, in contrast with 
Karachi, where these percentages are lower. More than 30 percent of large firms find that both quality and 
affordability are poor. For more than a quarter of the non -exporting firms, technology infrastructure is 
considered to be poor in terms of availability (27 percent), quality (29 percent), and affordability (24 
percent). All three aspects of technology infrastructure appear to be major problem s for non -expo rting firms 
in Quetta relative to the other cities in Pakistan. The results by firm size provide relatively similar results. 
Similarly, the quality and affordability of utilities are considered poor by more than a third of non -exporting 
firms. A larger per centage of firms in Islamabad, Lahore, and Quetta considered the affordability of utilities  
- 49 - 
 
 
Official Use  as poor compared to other areas, while more than one third of firms, across all sizes, consider  affordability 
of utilities as an issue. Finally, for more than a thi rd of small and large firms, affordability of office space 
is an issue of concern.  
 
D- POLICIES  TO FOSTER EXPORTS  
 
IT and IT -enabled service exports have become one of the most successful international activities in 
recent years . India’s success has been extensively documented, but India is not the only success story 
among developing countries. Firms in the Philippines and Costa Rica, as well as in Pakistan , are actively 
participating in the new opportunities opened by new information and communication. Th e survey explores 
the reasons why IT firms in Pakistan are not yet engaging in international operations, despite the available  
opportunities and the success  stories  in the country. Opinions and views from the private sector are 
summarized in Box 3 . 
 
Table 11 shows that 37 percent of the non-exporting firms prefer to focus on the domestic market.  In 
the case of non -exporter s in Islamabad , about 80 percent prefer to concentrate on the domestic market. 
Small, medium , and large firms have a relatively similar p reference for the domestic market. Among the 
non-exporters, 35 percent consider they do not have any exportable services as a reason for not engaging 
in international business . Among non -exporters in Karachi, 41 percent believe  that their services are not 
exportable. Surprisingly, 48 percent of large non -exporters consider that they do not have exportable 
services. Payment -related concerns explain why many firms do  not export ; 33 percent of firms are 
concerned that they may have  payment -related issues if they  engag ed in international business. This concern 
is more dominant in small firms than medium and large firms. Firms in Lahore have the great est concerns 
regarding payments.

Official Use    Box 3. What are the challenges that limit ICT exports?  
Problems were identified regarding capacity, scale, information constraints, and regulations as some of the 
causes for difficulties in exporting services by IT organizations.  
The participants initiated the discussion by talking about the presence of IT firms in the domestic market. 
Firstly, there is a sense of comfort to stay in the more familiar domestic market. Doing business outside 
Pakistan is very expensive since the rupee  to dollar conversion rate is fluctuating, which might lead to loss 
and bankruptcy for smaller firms in some cases. However,  the quality and produce of technology in Pakistan 
are lacking. Specific supply concerns identified relate to both problems with eng ineers and issues with 
managers. Also, formal education is lackluster, and certifications are not available at affordable prices. There 
is a difference between certifications for individuals vs. certifications for organizations and the re is a  lack of 
the latter at the  national level. It was also noted  that there is an adverse impact of the low business volume  in 
Pakistan . The country’s  IT sector seems to be suffering from  a cyclical problem: to increase capacity, 
organizations need the volume of projects; h owever, service delivery is lackluster in these projects owing to 
supply -side problems. There is a general fear regarding how a firm’s expansion might hamper the business 
(lack of awareness and information hinders them as well). The government should play an active  role in 
providing a platform to exhibit the IT industry to the world so  that they can gain more business. The 
government has the PSEB to support IT firms, but firms need to register to export, and there is no proper 
guidance on how to start.   
Foreign exchange regulations are an important constraint.  Banks have concerns that receiving transactions 
from abroad through a third -party bank end s up taking months to process in some cases. Banks do not work 
on B2B platforms , instead they use  P2P; it is a ll about having that contact who help s get your payments 
through smoothly.   
Firms believe that social media is important for future business development. The government chooses to 
restrict it , rather than explore it to understand the potential it holds. F or example, YouTube was banned for a 
period of time,  and thus  Pakistani YouTubers are not doing as well as others  around the world , especially due 
to a lack of experience an d exposure. This is a potential market that needs to  be tap ped into . For the 
advanc ement of social media  use, there is a sense of fear among  social media users in expanding to export 
and they are unsure about proceeding in the future.  
When talking about exporting, physical exports have many complex custom rules and logistics. Yet, in th e 
case of electronic exports, there is a lack of research . There is a need to understand the local dynamics of the 
destination country. Products exported fail because  people do not research and develop their products 
according to the standards of the speci fic company. Standards in Pakistan do not translate  abroad, an aspect 
many IT firms cho ose to ignore, and , eventually, their product seems to fail. The government needs to create 
an avenue through which IT firms can be more aware of exporting  standards .    
In Pakistan, there is also a hindrance due to cultural norms. The older generation is not willing to change their 
ways since they believe that the idea that worked for them is the best way to move ahead, and they do not 
need to explore other avenues to grow further.  
A firm rarely chooses to get patents in Pakistan since the courts are not very cooperative. Instead, people 
prefer to get them either from Singapore or the USA (global patents). Another critical issue was the one 
around visas, and how firms need to travel to countries to be able to network  with foreign firms. They are 
required to place representatives in these specific regions , hence they require visas. Pakistanis have 
approximately 17 countries where they can obtain  visas on arrival. In contrast, India has 70 -plus, hence the 
reason for the IT industry flourishing in India at a faster rate than in Pakistan.  
Freelancers were also an important topic of discussion. It was n oted that freelancers made up almost half of 
the total IT sector in Pakistan. However, they suffered greatly due to regulatory problems. One of the primary 
problems identified was the difficulty in sending money out of Pakistan due to remittance taxes.

Official Use  State agencies should increase their efforts to provide information on market opportunities abroad.  
Access to information regarding opportunities for exporting , as well as regulatory barriers and complexity  
of regulations , are two critical  explanation s for not engaging in export activities, for 30 percent of firms 
identify these as important reasons for not exporting. Firms located in Lahore, as well as in Peshawar, state 
high regulatory concerns as reasons for not exporting, while there does not seem to be significant 
differences among small, medium , and large firms.  For almost a quarter of the firms, export finance for 
clients and the costs of exporting are identified as the reason for not engaging in export activities. Again, 
this is an important issue for firms in Lahore and Peshawar. Costs for exporting are relatively more 
important for medium firms compared to small and large firms, while export financing for clients is more 
important for large f irms. Private sector interviewees  noted that it was difficult for smaller companies to 
connect with clients and that companies have no access to information on the ir needs and requirements. 
Furthermore, while it is costly to reach out to clients through a representative office, firms consider  it 
necessary to have front offices in the destination countries.  
 
Internationalization has received the support of the government, but more can be done . The Pakistan 
Service Exports Board (PSEB) is the government agenc y under the Ministry of IT and Telecom responsible 
for the promotion  of the IT industry of Pakistan both locally and globally . The PSEB  provides several  
important services to firms to help them tap into global markets. For example, PSEB membership helps 
them interact with other agencies and firms . The PSEB site facilitate s the process of getting  a small 
company registered and share s information about domestic and international events in which firms could 
participate. PSEB is also responsible for the registr ation of IT and BPO firms, which is compulsory for 
firms to benefit from current and future fiscal and non -fiscal incentives , as well as to allow in and out 
transfers.62 And yet, among the exporting firms surveyed, 56 percent are members of PSEB, only 25 p ercent 
are members of a chamber of commerce and industry, and only 21 percent are member s of PASHA.  
Membership of non -exporter firms in these entities is much lower. Also, the role of PSEB remains limited 
and should be significantly strengthened. Private sector representatives interviewed, while valuing PSEB ’s 
role, consider that it does  not actively promote the industry abroad, limiting its role to sharing information. 
According to Couto and Fernandez -Stark (2019) , PSEB has failed to implement adequate marketing 
strategies and local support industry mechanisms and need s to articulate and  execute initiatives to attract 
FDI and  export promotion.  Promotion policies should als o be closely coordinated and monitored in 
collaboration with the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan  as well as the private sector .  
IV- POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS   
 
Pakistan 's exports of digital goods and services are growing fast and can potentially transform the 
knowledge content of its export basket.  Important policy decisions are necessary, and the digital trade 
policy framework needs to be right. Digital trade makes available digital technologies that help to exploit 
niche markets for new digital exports and to allow for more competition to improve resource allocation . In 
the current context of  the outbreak of the Covid -19 pandemic , the importance of IT and IT -enabled services 
as crucial inputs to continue producing while preserving social distancing  is now more evident and urgent . 
It is still unknown what  the post -Covid -19 business landscape will lo ok like, but IT and IT -enabled services 
will play an even more prominent role than they do today. This report presents evidence that backs up key 
recommendations – some already outlined in Pakistan@100  and other recent analytical work such as 
McKenna, Roch a, and Varela (2020) . The ingredients for a successful reform strategy should include 
interventions in three policy areas : a) regulatory capabilities and governance; b) sector -specific policies; 
and c) complementary supporting policies.

Official Use  a- REGULATORY CAPABILITIES AND GOVERNANCE  
 
i. Create new institutional capabilities and moderniz e regulatory arrangements. For example,  
while firms' registration processes have improved significantly in recent years (e.g. online 
registration has been introduced ), the licensing process is still difficult. Licenses are also required 
to be renewed  regularly . Procedures for renewals are unnecessarily long and require similar 
documents as for obtaining a de novo  license. Firms need to work with lawyers and auditors, which 
increases their operating costs or discourage s formalization and scaling up of small and medium -
size firms altogether. Freelancers face significant challenges to open bank accounts due to existing 
regulations and acceding foreign markets. The new bus iness models created by the new technologies 
require training public officials to facilitate their understanding of how businesses are organized and 
operate and to modernize regulations . It will require transforming existing legal requirements for 
creating  firms and supervising firms' operations, updating the taxation system and foreign exchange 
regulations, and using new technologies. The public and private sectors should jointly organize 
trainings, agree on course content and requirements, and issue certi fication s to public officials that 
attend. The trainings should aim to increas e knowledge and understanding of new business models, 
discussing international management practices in the context of digital technologies, and adopting 
modern regulatory approaches.   
 
ii. Strengthen regulatory governance.  The report finds that the main challe nges in regulatory matters 
in Pakistan are twofold: on the one hand, there are weak proper regulatory procedures in place, 
regulatory requirements are difficult to understand and, in some cases, unpredictable, regulation 
enforcement is uneven, and subject to discretion. On the other hand, there are significant capacity 
gaps among agencies responsible for regulatory matters beyond the poor understanding of business 
models in the context of the digital economy. These problems should be addressed by a gradual 
adoption and effective implementation of basic internationally recognized regulatory principles , 
such as the OECD good regulatory practices, strengthening capacity at the agency levels, including 
at the provincial level.63 
 
iii. Invest in data collection . Policy decisions, incentive programs , and schemes need to be informed 
and monitored by data. Pakistan needs to establish a more comprehensive framework for data 
collection at different levels: macro and firm -level data are essential, as well as national and 
provincial -level data. Data should include domestic variables and precise international transaction s 
to measure the main trends, development, and characteristics of the sector and firms. Similarly, 
Pakistan lacks detailed firm -level information. The recent em pirical literature on trade, including 
the empirical trade policy research, has moved in the direction of using more and more information 
at the firm -level for which economic information such as productivity can be analysed. Information 
would not only incl ude standard variables such as value -added, production, sales, input usage 
(divided over raw materials, goods , and specific services), but also exports, imports, capital stock, 
employment (i.e. number of workers), wages, and R&D expenses, etc. This data sh ould be sorted 
by firm ID, year, location of the firm, and/or firm type. Usually, such firm -level information is based 
on a firm’s balance sheet information, which, in many countries, firms are obliged to provide to 
national statistical agencies through su rveys. It would be essential for Pakistan to set up a team of 
statisticians and economists to work on collecting such data.

Official Use  b- SECTOR -SPECIFIC POLICIES  
 
i. Accelerate the adoption of digital technologies. Digital technologies will become more relevant 
to support government services and policies, including during emergencies. The Covid -19 crisis has 
forced governments to get closer to citizens and firms while delivering solutions from a distance. 
Physical in teractions between people and public officials have been constrained and digital solutions 
have been designed across the world to reach out remotely to support businesses and households 
that are immediately affected by policy responses and the economic slo wdown. The Government of 
Pakistan should accelerate the implementation of e -government solutions and move to a process of 
automation in government -to-business interactions. While progress ha s been significant in recent 
years, for instance, connecting farme rs to markets, Pakistan is still lagging on government 
digitalization.64 Pakistan should develop policies conducive to an accelerate d adoption of innovative 
digital solutions, in collaboration with the private sector, to improve service delivery in a post -
Covid -19 policy environment.  
 
ii. Lower tariffs on digital goods and reduce taxes levied on data . High duties on imports constrain 
acces s to high -quality inputs needed in downstream IT -sectors.65 Pakistan still  applies duties on 
imports of digital products at an average of 13.7 percent, increasing production costs for all sectors 
in the economy – particularly in a context in which digital technologies can help the economy 
function to some extent while preserving social distancing. The reduction should be gradual and 
focus on products included in the WTO’s Information Technology Agreement. On domestic 
taxation, there are two related issues : a) taxation policies; and b) tax administration and practices 
(governance). This issue requires urgent attention from the authorities at the central and provincial 
levels. Pakistan will benefit from simplification and better coordination of tax authoritie s.  
 
iii. Improve human capital related to technology innovations . The focus should be to fill the skills 
gaps which are essential for the digital economy and are required by the IT and ITeS industry. First , 
the Higher Education Commission (HEC) in Pakistan, un iversities, and other stakeholders should 
collaborate and agree on a curricular update to tackl e the country’s professional and technical 
needs. Second, the IT industry, on the other hand, needs to better identify and communicate the 
necessary learning req uirements and missing skills,  including soft skills. Third, a mechanism to 
improve the integration of lower -tier universities with industry is also required. One option to speed  
up the process is to facilitate and encourag e hiring coders from the private s ector to teach courses 
in universities. Finally, HEC and universities need to start recognizing credit from online courses 
(e.g. online coding courses from Coursera and EdX that have the necessary quality accreditation). 
This will allow students to acceler ate upgrading their skills. In the context of the Covid -19 crisis 
this has become even more relevant and urgent. In the case of Pakistan, there are significant specific 
skills gaps among computer science engineers and professionals which need to be tackled  to ensure 
the future growth of the sector, including: (i) inability to code in contemporary technology 
platforms; (ii) weak English skills; (iii) poor comprehension readiness to address foreign clients' 
concerns; (iv) inadequate soft skills, namely commun ication and teamwork; and (v) poor 
knowledge of corporate culture, e.g. reporting, compliance, escalations, email etiquette, and 
protocols.66

Official Use  iv. Strengthen promotion activities. While the role and contribution to the internationalization of 
Pakistani firms o f the PSEB is recognized, the institution could be strengthened. PSEB should 
dedicate more effective efforts to support firms’ participation in international promotion activities 
in close coordination with the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan, while  maintaining its 
efforts to facilitate business activities and streamlining procedures and regulations. PSEB is 
perceived as a relatively weak organization which has not attained  the performance expected from 
businesses and does not strategically use Pakistan i representations abroad. PSEB should learn from 
and adopt good promotion practices from successful experiences including from Costa Rica, India , 
and the Philippines. Strengthe ning PSEB promotion activities will require overcom ing resources 
constraints and mobiliz ing financial resources from interested private sector  parties . Also, it 
requires adopting managerial practices according to promotion activities, establishing and 
implementing a strategy with clear and measurables indicators, and a monitoring and evaluation 
framework, and hir ing staff with the require d capabilities.  
 
c- COMPLEMENTARY SUPPORTING POLICIES   
 
i. Introduce regulatory changes to personal data protection.  The objec tive of the regulation 
should, on the one hand, aim to achiev e the legitimate policy objective, i.e., data and consumer 
protection, and on the other hand, allow data flow to promote high value -added services activities. 
In other words, these regulations sh ould avoid increasing input costs for firms, ultimately affecting 
their productivity. This can be achieved by  subscribing to general principles broadly accepted 
internationally , such as the OECD privacy principles guidelines, or from the Asia –Pacific 
Econo mic Cooperation (APEC) forum. Ultimately, a strong international ly recognize d regulatory 
regime will be required to allow for constructive cooperation between Pakistan and its main trading 
partners to allow flow of data. This will require a delicate balance of share responsibilities from 
both the data source country and the destina tion country. Also, it will require increasing levels of 
convergence on privacy protection requirements set by data source countries and the protection 
standards offered by the destination countries.67  
 
ii. Improve the intellectual property rights (IPR) frame work and create trust in the system for 
digital companies.  Pakistan is already active primarily in information technology outsourcing 
(ITO) and business process outsourcing (BPO). These services account for 87 percent and 13 
percent of Pakistan's total ser vices exports, respectively. However, to sustain growth in this sector 
and to encourage firms to come up with innovations in the industry, intellectual property needs to 
be protected adequately. The private sector pointed out the importance of IPRs for the ir future 
growth. Seventy -three percent of exporting firms and 64 percent of non -exporting firms surveyed 
consider that insufficient IPRs  in Pakistan are an obstacle for their business. To move up in the IT 
and digital services value chain, both IPRs and a ccess to commercial data are critical pillars. The 
agenda on IPRs and privacy concerns in trade agreements will be accentuated with cross -border 
data flows. At the international level, IPR has long been part of the trade agenda, but data is a new 
factor de termining digital trade. Content providers could restrict the provision of some services to 
countries where IPRs are inadequately protected. This can increase difficulties in generating 
exportable content as well as affecting access to imported content.  
 
iii. Engage in trade agreements. Restrictions on cross -border data flow through, for example, data 
localization requirements, are on the rise. Pakistan's entrepreneurs face a significant limitation to 
travel to promote their business and develop opportunities.  Provisions related to IPRs and 
 
67 Mattoo and Metzler (2018), World Bank (2016) and (2020).

Official Use  consumer , privacy , and data protection have increasingly been included in last generation trade 
agreements, and the services trade, including through temporary movement of person s, has also 
been addressed. Pakistan should evaluate a strategy to engage in trade agreements to address its 
business interests proactively.68 Regional and bilateral trade agreements are likely to be central in 
driving connectedness to markets in the future give n the existing challenges at the multilateral 
level.

DEFINITIONS  
 
Computer and other services (WDI):  Category of services that is comprised of a broader set of services, namely 
communications, computer, information, and other services that cover international telecommunications; computer 
data; news -related service transactions between residents and non -residents; construction services; royalties and 
license fees; miscellaneous business, professional, and technical services; personal, cultural, and recreational services; 
manufacturing services on physical inputs owned by others; and maintenance and repair services and government 
services not included elsewhere. This category of services represents in large  part the digital -enabled services, which 
are services that can be delivered over the internet and/or with the help of ICT and other software.  
Digital go ods: Generic term that refers to ICT goods, commodities , and inputs. In this note digital goods largely refer 
to goods covered by the WTO’s International Technology Agreement (ITA). However, in relation to ECIPE’s DTRI 
this definition is expanded with addi tional 4 and 6 -digit HS codes on the basis of Lee -Makiyama (2011) expanded list 
of digital goods in Annex 2. They are mainly to be found in 2 -digit categories 84, 85 , and 90, and on some occasions 
from categories 38 and 70.  
Digital services: Generic term that refers to ICT and associated services that are produced and delivered over the 
internet and /or with the help of ICT and other software. It mainly includes computer, telecoms, some news -related 
services and information, data services, and various techn ical services, as well as services provided over digital 
platforms. It usually excludes business, professional, and technical services; personal, cultural , and recreational 
services (unless provided over the internet), manufacturing service s on physical in puts owned by others, and 
maintenance and repair services (unless provided over the internet) and government services not included elsewhere.  
Endowments: A country’s factor of production with which it produces goods and services in the economy, such as 
human capital or physical capital. Other types of endowments that have recently gained increasing attention as 
additional factors of production , which are marked as important for producing goods and services , are domestic 
institutions such as the rule of law and digital infrastructure (or digital connectivity) such as a good 
telecommunication s network.  
ICT services (WDI):  Services such as computer and communications services (telecommunications and postal and  
courier services) and information services (computer data and news -related service transactions). This category of 
services is the pure ICT services.  
Innovation activities (WB Enterprise Surveys): The creation of new products or processes by firms. Typic ally, 
innovation activities refer to whether firms have developed new products/services that are also new to the main market 
or introduced any new or significantly improved process.   
Technology adoption (WEF): The capacity with which an economy can adapt existing technologies. Typically, 
technology is a broad concept that covers products and processes. Examples of the former are machinery and material; 
examples of the latter are process and organizations. They contribute to a conducive innovation ecosystem . In many 
cases, new technologies and their adoption go hand -in-hand with ICT. Generally, two sources of technology adoption 
are identified in the economy, namely when local firms can invest to bring in technology from abroad or from other 
sectors or compa nies, and when a country can exploit spillovers from the FDI of international companies.
