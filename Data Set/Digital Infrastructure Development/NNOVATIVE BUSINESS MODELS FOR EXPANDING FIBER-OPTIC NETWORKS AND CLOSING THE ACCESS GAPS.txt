Foreword
It is my pleasure to present this flagship report on 
Innovative Business Models for Expanding Fiber-Optic Networks 
and Closing the Access Gaps . 
For decades, the World Bank Group has been engaging 
with client governments around the world to improve 
digital connectivity and access, supporting policy and reg -
ulatory reforms and investments for broadband communi -
cations infrastructure. In the process, we have personally 
witnessed the evolution of mobile services and broadband Internet from being a luxury service to becoming an 
important part of many people’s lives, and a key driver of 
economic and social development. 
By creating new business models, products, and services, 
digital innovation provides unprecedented opportunities 
for countries to accelerate growth and skip the traditional 
stages of development. In fact, the digital economy is 
expected to account for a quarter of the world’s GDP within the next decade.
Digital technologies are also bringing entirely new solutions 
to complex global challenges like gender inequality, climate 
risk, and unemployment. In addition, new and emerging 
technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, 
and wireless systems are quickly transforming the way we 
are delivering services, including to poor and marginalized 
populations. 
Of course, none of this is possible without efficient and 
reliable connectivity. While the UN Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) aim to achieve affordable and universal 
Internet access by 2020, we still have a long way to go. 
Today, approximately 4 billion people live without Internet 
access, 90 percent of whom live in developing countries. The 
urban-rural divide remains a challenge, and digital inclusion 
of women is lagging in developing countries. Further, the high price of Internet services in many countries continues 
to undermine broadband adoption, particularly for the poor.After years of rapid expansion, the next stage of broadband 
development will be more complex. Extending broadband 
access to rural areas and poorer and marginalized popu -
lations will require new business models, creative thinking, and active cooperation between all relevant stakeholders. 
This report was prepared as a joint effort between the 
World Bank and the International Finance Cooperation (IFC), 
with support from our Digital Development Partnership 
(DDP) donors. It provides a comprehensive overview of the various business models that have been adopted globally to 
support high-quality digital infrastructure, and will serve as 
a reference tool for policy makers to tailor these solutions 
to their country’s circumstances and needs.  
The report reviews 70 case studies from across the world, 
spanning all segments of the broadband value chain—in-
ternational connectivity, national backbone, middle mile 
and last mile connectivity—and proposes a framework to analyze how they can be replicated elsewhere. With 
wireless technology leading the way in connecting individ-
uals, it also analyzes key trends related to spectrum policy 
and planning.  
I am confident this report can become a powerful tool 
for countries to fulfill their digital potential and build the 
foundations for vibrant, inclusive digital economies.

Executive Summary
The increasing importance of the Internet—not only for tasks related to information search, storage, and sharing, 
but also for connecting people and business, domestic and international trade, education, entertainment and social interactions—has led governments around the world to include Internet connectivity in their priority policy agendas and infrastructure plans. Today, access to the Internet is no longer a luxury, but is increasingly consid-ered an essential service, as important as building transportation and utility networks. However, more than four billion people, overwhelmingly in developing countries, still lack Internet access.
For the past decade, policy makers have sought ways to best create an enabling environment to direct national 
resources and engage the private sector to effectively expand access to the Internet. In doing so, policy makers and regulators face a unique combination of priorities, resources, market structures, and geographies that will affect their national plans. Experience shows that no one-size-fits-all approach exists, but past and current experience can be analyzed for common factors contributing to success or failure to support similar endeavors in the future.
This report reviews and provides guidance on innovative business models and approaches to the deployment of 
high-speed broadband networks and highlights global trends related to terrestrial spectrum resources that can be leveraged to meet expected future demand and close existing Internet access gaps. It is intended to serve as a reference tool to help policy makers and regulators assess alternatives for infrastructure deployment and adopt decisions tailored to their country’s circumstances and needs.INNO VATIVE BUSINESS MODELS FOR EXPA NDING FIBER- OPTIC NETW ORKS AND CL OSING THE ACCESS GAPS13
New Business Models for Broadband Infrastructure Deployment
Over the past several years, new business models 
have expanded Internet access and helped to ensure that technology developments are deployed in areas typically not served through traditional approaches to broadband network buildout. Private actors, governments, and international organizations have sought solutions to the challenges confronted to serve communities that are not receiving the full benefits of broadband because the deployments are not finan-cially viable for the private sector to invest in alone. However, the menu of solutions is not static as techno-logical change continually generates new opportuni-ties and undermines traditional business models. 
KEY TRENDS IN SPECTRUM POLICY AND 
PLANNING
Wireless technologies are the most common means 
of accessing the Internet. As such, regulators and policy makers need to ensure timely and adequate access to spectrum under transparent, reasonable, and flexible use terms and conditions in order to enable the expansion of broadband access and facilitate the deployment of new and innovative applications. 
Multiple levers can be adjusted to encourage 
effective use of spectrum resources and wireless technologies. To this end, chapter 2.1 focuses on wireless infrastructure and global trends in spectrum policy and planning, touching on key technologies that are enabling and expanding terrestrial wireless broadband Internet access. Although not intended as a detailed review of global spectrum considerations, this focused examination of key spectrum issues is crucial to understanding the trends affecting the wireless technologies that currently represent the most common means of accessing the Internet:
 •Spectrum for 5G and the IoT.  Internet access 
is moving towards a connected society, with smart applications provided by different Internet of Things (IoT) use cases. The deployment of 5G networks will further enable the move toward ubiquitous connectivity. As such, global stakeholders are working to identify spectrum to enable the next wave of wireless broadband growth, and the next tranche of spectrum for mo -
bile services, intended to enable 5G services and facilitate the IoT. This includes existing spectrum identifications below 6 GHz, and new spectrum ranges under study between 24 GHz and 86 GHz. 
 •Alternative Models of Authorizing Spectrum Use. On the licensing side, policy makers contin-ue to issue spectrum licenses for the deployment of large mobile networks and fixed wireless services. In order to address the growth of spectrum demand, alternative authorization and spectrum-use models continue to evolve, such as the use of unlicensed spectrum, commonly con-sidered for short-range, last-mile connectivity, as well as spectrum trading and spectrum sharing.
 •Spectrum Repurposing and Refarming.  
Spectrum usage should be monitored to ensure its continuous efficient use. Spectrum available for older generations of mobile broadband can be refarmed to allow its use by newer technolo -
gies. Regulators are also revising existing spec -
trum arrangements and rules, to repurpose the spectrum used by other services and enable the deployment of mobile broadband. A key example is the low-band spectrum newly available for use following technical improvements to television broadcasting (known as the digital dividend) and which is particularly attractive for expanding wireless network coverage.
These trends will inform ongoing global developments that enable both the identification of new spectrum and additional options for enabling the most efficient and innovative uses of existing spectrum resources. It is critical that regulators consider how these devel-opments are already taking shape, and the potential impacts on national ICT sectors and regulation. 14
SPECTRUM-SPECIFIC PRINCIPLES
In considering how best to leverage spectrum re -
sources, the following core set of spectrum principles 
were used to develop the recommendations set out in this report:
 •Leverage flexibility to enable the introduction and growth of emerging technologies, notably 5G and IoT. Although 5G technology has been in development for several years and IoT devices and services are already in use, both technologies are expected to experience considerable further development and growth. Regulators and policy makers should ensure that their actions not only do not constrain such growth but, rather, facilitate and encourage it, building frameworks that maximize flexibility, enable innovation, minimize administrative burdens, and take into account the characteristics that make these technologies different from earlier innovations.
 •Maximize spectrum access for wireless broad-band services. Demand for wireless broadband services has continued to grow unabated, driven in part by the continuing improvement of wire-less technologies and their new applications, and the increasing ability to use spectrum flexibly to serve different needs and users. Policy makers and regulators seeking to expand access to broadband should keep in mind that the most important method by which to increase capacity and improve the user experience is to ensure the availability of appropriate spectrum for use by wireless broadband services. In addition, regu-latory frameworks should facilitate flexible use, allowing for pooling and sharing, to maximize use and efficiency, while at the same time promoting competition.
 •Implement strategies specifically targeting unserved and underserved populations.  
Reaching areas and populations that continue to lack adequate—or any—broadband access will require new, more flexible approaches and reconsideration of the role of government. The advent of new wireless technologies with differ -
ent characteristics and use cases than existing mobile networks should prompt actions that can strengthen existing successful approaches and leverage new technologies, business models, and spectrum authorization approaches to provide governments and regulators with a flexible set of tools with which to develop new sector strategies.
TECHNOLOGY TRENDS IMPACTING NEW BUSINESS MODELS
A number of technology trends strongly impact 
existing business models or inspire new ones: 
 •Technological advancements continuously challenge the notion of what constitutes a financially 
nonviable service area. As unit costs of service provision fall, areas previously considered uneconomic may become profitable for service providers with fewer government incentives or less intervention. 
 •Virtuous circles of bandwidth deployments are created. Higher bandwidth international and core network support cheaper and more compelling end-user service offerings. Higher bandwidth access technologies deployed more broadly in rural/suburban areas lead to greater capacity requirements in international, national core network and middle-mile networks.
 •Legacy investment may be sunk, but historic deployments still may stand in the way of innovation. In markets in which incumbents have significant copper access infrastructure, rollout of superfast fiber networks may be delayed.INNO VATIVE BUSINESS MODELS FOR EXPA NDING FIBER- OPTIC NETW ORKS AND CL OSING THE ACCESS GAPS15
 •Wi-Fi as an established relative low-cost wireless technology has inspired a breed of new innovative 
business models. 
 •New low-cost satellite deployments are promising to change the relatively limited performance and expensive broadband services delivered via satellite. 
 •TV white spaces is a low-cost alternative technology for rural coverage that has gained some mo -
mentum in recent years due to standardization by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), but there are no large-scale deployments yet. 
 •Drones, balloons, and other nonpermanent structures are being developed for middle/last-mile access; however, most are still in concept development.
 •Using open-source software applications and out-of-the box small cell solutions rather than tradi -
tional cellular technology are providing opportunity for lowering the network costs for extension networks in rural areas. 
These technology trends are further explored in chapter 2.2.
BUSINESS MODELS REVIEWEDThis report reviews 70 Internet-related infrastructure projects
1 from around the world spanning the entire 
broadband infrastructure value chain (see appendix): crossborder, national backbone, middle mile, and last 
mile. These initiatives were categorized in terms of the primary attributes that may contribute to a deployment’s relative success and evaluated according to a variety of success measures, as shown in table 0.1.
1 The term “project” is used generally throughout the study to indicate cases of infrastructure deployment. It may refer to specific deployment 
activity, initiatives, or companies engaging in infrastructure deployment.Table 0.1: Attributes and Success Measures
Primary attributes Success measures
 •The market structure in which the deployment 
operates; 
 •The economic context (for example, strength of demand);

Findings and Recommendations
In determining a best-fit approach for facilitating 
infrastructure deployment and leveraging spectrum resources to expand Internet access, the following recommendations were developed, based on the assessment of the 70 projects and relevant spectrum trends.
GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONSThere are five key principles that should form 
the basis of any policy for promoting broadband deployment:
 •Limited, incremental state intervention.  
Governments should intervene only in cases of clear market failure and only to the extent neces-sary to overcome market failure and complement private investment. In such cases, the government should attempt to achieve its objectives through the least disruptive means possible and should only increase the scale or degree of intervention if the market failure proves persistent.
 •Minimize regulatory failure.  Governments can 
take many actions to encourage infrastructure deployment that do not require any direct intervention in the market. The state should first consider the result of measures to obviate or minimize regulatory  failure before it concludes 
that market failure exists. 
 •Consensus on a coherent vision, political will, and leadership.  Intervention should be based on 
clear policy objectives for the sector, be conduct -
ed with commitment on the part of leadership, and flow through to regulation consistent with the policy objectives. 
 •Governments should take a sober view of what activity it can credibly and reliably carry out. All states will have limits as to the skill sets, finances, and legal authority, among others, available to actively participate in infrastructure deployment. Governments should assess these capabilities and craft their participation accordingly.
 •Promoting competition.  Government interven -
tion should be directed at increasing competition, through service-based competition when infrastructure competition is not viable. When infrastructure competition is not feasible, gov -
ernments should generally support open access wholesale arrangements. 
SPECTRUM-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS
The following recommendations, built upon the 
spectrum principles and trends identified above, are intended to assist stakeholders, particularly regulators and policy makers, when considering new technologies and trends in the context of spectrum policy. Comprehensive approaches to ensuring Internet access for all will benefit from early consider -
ation of principles to make effective and efficient use of spectrum resources:
 •Promoting 5G and IoT deployment:  Implement 
policies that enable stakeholders to innovate and leverage emerging technologies made possible by advances in wireless broadband technologies, such as 5G and the IoT. 
 •Supporting expected demand growth:  Enable 
and encourage wireless broadband networks to supply adequate capacity and coverage to meet expected demand for broadband connectivity. 
 •Expanding wireless broadband to unserved and underserved areas: Enable and promote the efficient and innovative use of spectrum and business models that can strengthen existing and new approaches and wireless broadband deployments.INNO VATIVE BUSINESS MODELS FOR EXPA NDING FIBER- OPTIC NETW ORKS AND CL OSING THE ACCESS GAPS17
INFRASTRUCTURE-SPECIFIC DEPLOYMENT 
RECOMMENDATIONS
The five general recommendations above are relevant 
to most interventions the government might con-sider, regardless of sector or objective. The analysis of the 70 broadband infrastructure projects also suggests some specific recommendations for infra-structure deployment, should the state decide it must intervene in ways that go beyond the use of standard tools of regulation. The following five specific recom-mendations are based on examination of the primary attributes and success criteria of the 70 Internet-related infrastructure projects examined in this study. 
 •Private sector participation. Government intervention in infrastructure deployment should involve the private sector wherever possible. The advantages of private-sector participation include the sharing of costs and risks, building expertise, and adding critical financial insight and caution that might not exist without it. Even where government intervention is indirect, implemented through policies such as taxation, subsidization, or regulatory obligation, the private sector impacts should be taken into consideration. The projects reviewed include numerous public-pri -
vate partnerships (PPPs) where the initiative was simply not possible without private capital or benefited significantly in terms of rollout and financial viability from having private entities involved in constructing and running the network. 
 •In the presence of state-owned incumbents, structural changes should be considered as part of the overall national plan.  If the state-
owned incumbent operator is part of the solution, then it is quite likely that some sort of restruc -
turing of the operator will be necessary to better position the incumbent to meet the broadband deployment goals. 
 •Utilities collaboration and enabling reuse.  
In many cases, the government has existing or planned utility infrastructure that is not factored in or not recognized when planning national broadband. Public utilities have valuable assets for broadband deployment purposes, such as ducts and poles, buildings, land rights, and even fiber networks that could be leveraged for cost-effective deployment of new broadband infrastructure. Particularly with a limited budget, the more infrastructure that is reused, the more homes and businesses could be covered. Also, telecommunications and other utilities’ networks could be deployed via a single civil works initiative. 
 •Justification should be based on a realistic business case and socioeconomic cost-benefit analysis  with a view to local, national, and re -
gional trends in the future. Governments should intervene with the objective of mimicking risk-ad -
justed, externality-adjusted market outcomes. In other words, economic net present value (ENPV) should be calculated and the initiative reconsid -
ered or abandoned if not positive. 
 •One business model’s failure can lead to another’s success. The history of telecommu-nications infrastructure is filled with examples of overbuild, asset stranding, underutilization, and failed commercial endeavors of all sorts. While in the short run some projects may be wasteful, nevertheless, in the context of increasing long-term demand, long-lived assets can often be repurposed, commercialized, or otherwise brought back into productive use and facilitate new entry for the benefit of all. This notion applies to much of the infrastructure of utilities, government-owned networks and facilities of bankrupt public service providers. Policy makers can act to reduce the time that assets lay idle by (re)commercializing and reducing barriers to cross-sectoral engagement. 
Finally, the business models reviewed provides a rich collection of lessons for policy makers seeking to 
intervene to deploy in underserved areas . This 
report provides a decision-making tool (see figure 0.1) to identify experiences that may be particularly 18
relevant for policy makers, given the attributes of 
the particular infrastructure challenge that they may encounter. In particular, the tool suggests various options for business models—segmentation, financ -
ing, management, and revenue generation—that can contribute to successful infrastructure deployment.
The decision-making tool considers seven scenarios, 
as well as a “null” scenario where the state should reconsider any proposed intervention. Where there is no demonstrable market or regulatory failure to address, state action is generally not justified. There are at least three examples in the list of reviewed projects where the state may have been unneces-sarily ambitious in its objectives—the second phase of Rwanda NBFON (involving the pursuit of a single wholesale mobile network for 4G), Peru RNDOFO, and South Africa’s Broadband InfraCo. In the latter two, state investment was made in national backbones in markets in which the private sector was capable of delivering infrastructure on its own. 
Scenario 1 results when there is no inherent market 
failure, but counterproductive regulation, unnec -
essary legal constraints, or unduly burdensome financial obligations are imposed by the state. In this scenario, the state’s role is simply to eliminate or minimize the self-created cause of infrastructure inadequacy. In most cases, this amounts to improv -
ing licensing—simply authorizing the entry of new players, ensuring spectrum is available, and so on. 
Scenario 2 is the case of market failure primarily 
arising from dominance in the market. Here more active regulatory intervention may be required. This may take the form of more active encouragement of private sector competitors, for example, the creation of WIOCC in the crossborder market of East Africa, mandated access of dominant player networks, or more radical solutions such as structural separation.
Before addressing other, more interventionist, roles 
that the state may play in infrastructure development, the state has to answer the question of whether it is capable of taking on such a role to create missing markets or infrastructure. The vast majority of states are in some way capable of playing a constructive role; however, there are states that have severe institutional issues, or an inability to commit to required policy or provide appropriate leadership. In these cases ( Scenario 3) dealing with fundamental 
governance weaknesses must be a central part of any development program implemented.
Consistent with the principle of promoting competi -
tion, the next question is whether a more active role 
for the state can be used to create service-based competition. If the market cannot even support service-based competition ( Scenario 4), then it is 
probably very thin. These cases tend to be remote local markets. There are a number of innovative technologies and business models discussed in this report that address these particular circumstances. 
Scenario 5, 6, and 7 address state action that is 
progressively more interventionist. In each case, the state’s financial commitments should be justified on the basis of a robust cost-benefit analysis. Scenario 5 is the case where the state can limit its intervention to subsidy, preferential financing, or sales commitments, which offset low or uncertain nonstate revenues. In this case, the state can stay out of the management or ownership of the entity undertaking the project. Ideally, incentives would be competed for through an appropriately structured tender process.
Scenario 6 represents those cases in which the 
subsidy required to interest the private sector in taking up the opportunity is too high for the state to afford. In these cases, the state must take on more of the project risk in order to attract the private sector. 
Scenario 7 is limited to those instances in which the 
state cannot build a sufficiently attractive offer of financial incentives and risk-sharing to interest the private sector. This would be a very small set of cases indeed. Of all the projects reviewed in this report, arguably, only one may have met this criterion.INNO VATIVE BUSINESS MODELS FOR EXPA NDING FIBER- OPTIC NETW ORKS AND CL OSING THE ACCESS GAPS19

Today, the Internet is an essential part of our ev -
eryday lives—allowing us to be informed, transact 
business, and generally communicate. However, too many people still lack access to the Internet. This report seeks to offer guidance on which mechanisms can be used to expand Internet connectivity. These mechanisms include innovative business models and approaches to the deployment of high-speed broadband networks, as well as new trends related to terrestrial spectrum resources that can meet ex -
pected future demand and address existing Internet access gaps. This report is intended to serve as a reference tool to help policy makers and regulators assess alternatives for infrastructure deployment and adopt decisions tailored to their country’s circum -
stances and needs.In the past ten years, we have witnessed a massive increase in the need to deploy and upgrade tele -
communications infrastructure to meet the explosive demand for broadband Internet access. This high demand arises from the powerful virtuous circle of proliferation of increasingly data-consumptive devices and applications in everyday life, increasing relevance of content, readiness of the consumer market and falling service, device, and application prices.1.

Closing the Digital Divide 
Most of the broadband telecommunications 
investment in the past decade was focused on larger cities with relatively high-density households and businesses. The effect of this investment was to widen the digital divide between cities and nonurban regions, especially rural areas, which are becoming relatively more isolated. This regional, profit-driven pattern occurred on a global scale, with an increasing divergence between more-developed and less-devel -
oped nations. 
According to a World Economic Forum (2017) report, 
more than half of the globe’s population—about four billion people—are not yet connected to the Internet. As shown in figure 1.1, there are multiple dimensions

In the current decade, we have seen better coordi -
nated initiatives to bridge this divide. Most govern -
ments around the world are now addressing the 
issue of connectivity to rural and other underserved areas in their priority policy agendas. Successful policies find constructive ways to join the public and private sectors, such as public-private initiatives (PPP); rely on regional initiatives for support (such as European funds for broadband development); and/or exploit new technologies (such as low-cost wireless solutions).

Upgrading the Broadband Infrastructure Value Chain 
The pressure to expand broadband infrastructure 
impacts the entire value chain from local access to international connectivity. The benefits of consistent synergistic development can be viewed within the context of the markets of a single region or nation, as well as within the context of uniting fragmented mar-kets across disparate national or regional chains. Each link in the infrastructure chain, shown in figure 1.2, poses its own challenges in the process of installation, expansion, and upgrade. To meet these challenges, service providers, investors, and governments must use a variety of technical, commercial, and business solutions. These challenges and some of the solutions found to address them are discussed in chapter 4 (crossborder and national backbone networks) and chapter 5 (middle-mile networks and last mile).

Sustainable Development, Climate Change, and Gender Equality
Digital infrastructure is a key foundational element 
which facilitates a country’s path to the digital economy, as a key enabler for development. A digital infrastructure lowers costs and enables scalable access to services essential for development, thus accelerating the ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Unfortunately, digitization is still nascent in most emerging markets and the World Bank Group recognizes that unless swift action is taken by the development community, the development gap is expected to increase mul-tiple times for countries that do not embrace the digital economy. 
Digital infrastructure is also essential for tackling 
global public issues such as climate change and gender disparity. Climate change is considered to be the defining challenge of our generation. Affordable and reliable digital infrastructure enables the implementation of practical and effective climate change adaptation and mitigation measures. In some cases, such as Vanuatu, a small Pacific island state that is highly prone to natural disasters, climate change adaptation plans explicitly note the need for backbone infrastructure investments to facilitate early warning and to coordinate response efforts to natural disasters. The methodology for greenhouse 
2 Engendering ICT Toolkit, World Bank, 2018.gas (GHG) accounting in the ICT sector is still in its infancy. However, a report by the Global e-Sustain -
ability Initiative (GeSI), an industry group, estimated that greater use of digital technologies could help reduce annual global emissions of carbon dioxide by 20 percent by 2030 (GeSI 2015). 
Finally, given that women constitute half of the 
world’s population, it is important to identify at the policy, legislative, and regulatory level, which actions should be taken to ensure equitable access to the Internet and digital technologies. Anecdotal evidence suggests that there is a significant gender gap in the use of digital technologies, particularly in remote areas where women may only be able to access the Internet at public access facilities.
2 The potential to 
expand opportunities for women across domains is enormous, including access to education, health ser -
vices, social security transfers, and greater Internet-enabled economic opportunities (for example, online work, digital commerce). Concerted efforts need to be taken to raise awareness, increase institutional capacity and collect actionable gender-disaggregated data in order to fully incorporate gender into national broadband plans, with a particular focus on innova -
tive solutions for last-mile access.24
1.2. The Methodology
This report examines how a wide array of business 
models have been used in infrastructure deploy -
ments around the world to deal with situations where infrastructure deployment proved to be problematic in recent years. The report examines 70 projects from around the world at different links in the infra -

Assessing these models requires being aware of 
all of the major attributes that may contribute to a deployment’s relative success. In the appendix to this report, projects are summarized based on the following attributes: 
 •Market structure in which the deployment operates;
 •Economic context  (for example, strength of 
demand);
 •Regulatory and policy efficacy, that is, how well policy, regulation, and enforcement align with objectives of the deployment;
 •Degree and nature of infrastructure sharing; and
 •Business model , which may include one of a 
number of approaches as discussed in detail in Chapter 3.
The appendix also lists measures of success, depend -
ing on the link in the value chain. For crossborder and national networks we examined:
1. Geographic reach of network,  that is, kilo -
meters achieved and cities/villages connected 
in absolute terms and relative terms reflecting market size;
2. Increase in installed bandwidth , including 
volume of national traffic;
3. Utilization of network  relative to legacy net -
work(s) replaced;
4. Prices of network  services relative to legacy 
prices;
5. Investment and unit investment  for example, 
per fiber kilometer; and
6. Performance to plan/viability, that is, success in 
respect to the specific project plan.For middle and last-mile projects, we examined:
1. Cost acceptance/affordability of the solution.  
This criterion identifies and benchmarks the cost 
per premise passed/connected to find examples where the cost is minimized, therefore making the solution more scalable and affordable;  
2. Take-up.  This criterion looks at the actual takeup 
of the backhaul (middle mile) or end-user connec -
tions (last mile). Although related to affordability, takeup is the ultimate criterion for deeming a project successful;  
3. Community involvement.  In many cases, the 
citizens in the underserved/unserved areas are aware of the benefits of the Internet for the community and the financial obstacles to en -
abling access. Hence the propensity for voluntary support and involvement is quite high in many communities. If there is an organized way of including the community in the building and/or fundraising processes, the cost of deployment can be lowered and takeup maximized as the community will have a vested interest in the project and will be more motivated to use what they have helped build; and  
4. Performance to plan/viability  (that is, success 
in respect to the specific project plan), including timescales for planning and execution, number of connections deployed, and so on. 
On the basis of this methodology, recommendations and lessons learned are provided, with respect to the effectiveness of business models in different circum -
stances. The recommendations provide a tool by which policy makers may choose the most appropri -
ate policy approach and business model to address the particular infrastructure challenge they face.26
1.3. Structure of the Report
Chapters 2 through 4 discuss the growing global 
experience of how best to implement infrastructure deployment from a business model perspective. Much has been written about broadband policy plan -
ning, the appropriate legal and regulatory framework to support broadband development, and the means to stimulate demand for broadband service. The purpose of these chapters is to examine the factors and attributes that contribute to successful business models, particularly in challenging circumstances where the market cannot be relied upon to deliver economically desirable broadband infrastructure.
 •Chapter 2 discusses the facilitation of broadband deployment, including wireless infrastructure, and trends affecting global availability of spectrum—a crucial input for enabling delivery of broadband via wireless technologies. This chapter also addresses technological trends, which strongly influence the practicalities and commercial nature of potential deployments. 
 •Chapter 3 discusses the dimensions of the business models for infrastructure deployment. •Chapter 4 examines crossborder (both subsea and terrestrial) and national backbone deploy -
ments, as well as the relevant deployment busi -
ness models and their relative success. 
 •Chapter 5 examines the experience and relative success of various business models for last-mile and middle-mile deployments.
 •Chapter 6 presents observations on the particular cases of cross-sectoral infrastructure sharing.
 •Chapter 7 presents conclusions and recommen -
dations, as well as a decision tree to enable policy makers to assess business models for broadband infrastructure deployment and choose compo -
nents of successful strategies, depending on a country’s given circumstances. In addition, it presents specific spectrum-related recommen -
dations focused on meeting expected Internet demand needs, expanding wireless broadband access to unserved and underserved areas, and facilitating 5G and IoT deployment. 
The appendix to this report summarizes the 70 case studies that inform the recommendations in this report.INNO VATIVE BUSINESS MODELS FOR EXPA NDING FIBER- OPTIC NETW ORKS AND CL OSING THE ACCESS GAPS27
Modern broadband deployment can take many forms—differentiated by reach (that is, wide area and local 
area networks) and technology (for example, optical fiber, copper wire, mobile cellular, Wi-Fi, satellite, and even drones and balloons). This chapter considers delivery of broadband service via terrestrial wireless services, as well as the evolution from technologies, such as DSL over copper wire to optical fiber, satellite, and other higher-capacity options.
Importantly, this chapter includes a discussion of radiofrequency spectrum, the key input for delivery of wireless 
broadband services. Wireless technologies enable mobility both within a broad area, such as a village or city, as well as within small areas, such as a home or business. Further, wireless infrastructure can often be less costly to install, enabling new or upgraded broadband connectivity that can serve as a substitute for wired infrastructure. Wireless technologies rely upon one or more spectrum bands—or portions of the radiofrequency spectrum—in order to transmit and receive data without the need for wires. As such, chapter 2.2 focuses on key develop -
ments related to spectrum and the delivery of wireless broadband services. This targeted examination of key spectrum issues is not, however, intended as a detailed review of global spectrum considerations.2. Facilitating Broadband Developments28
Spectrum is a key input to ensure “Internet access 
for all.” Today, the most common way to access the Internet around the world is via mobile broadband networks (3G, 4G/LTE), fixed-wireless networks (TD-LTE, WiMAX) and public or private Wi-Fi networks. Consumers worldwide are using a variety of devices—smartphones, laptops, tablets, and watches—to ac-cess the Internet. At the end of 2017, about 5.2 billion people accessed the Internet through a mobile broad-band device, an increase of about 15 percent year-on-year (Ericsson 2017).
The overarching trend in wireless broadband con -
nections and traffic is ever-increasing demand for 
spectrum to fuel the significant and ongoing growth in the number of broadband-connected devices, as well as the increasing rates of wireless data usage arising from both mobile broadband (International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT), commonly known as 3G, 4G, and 5G) and other wireless technologies. As a result, governments must identify the best possible ways to plan, allocate, and assign spectrum in order to meet the future needs of operators and consumers, while assuring efficient use of valuable spectrum resources and fostering competition. 
This chapter considers emerging trends related to 
terrestrial spectrum policy and planning that can assist key stakeholders in designing and developing their national spectrum plans to foster broadband, with input from industry players and civil society. It first addresses the impact of 5G services on spec-trum demand and international trends and efforts related to the identification of additional spectrum for expanded and enhanced wireless services. Second, it explores the use of unlicensed spectrum, a key enabler of expanded access to broadband services. Third, it discusses international develop-ments related to assignment of the digital dividend and new approaches to using the spectrum to meet broadband capacity and coverage needs.
The Emergence of 5G
With the ongoing development and impending launch of 5G networks, governments, regulators, and operators are seeking to identify additional spectrum to enable new and expanded services, including enhanced mobile broadband. These efforts will build on past mobile network operator accomplishments, expanding access, and creating new opportunities for delivery of broadband and broadband-enabled services. 5G will leverage new wireless technologies and additional spectrum bands to enable not only faster mobile broadband, but also massive IoT and mission-critical services. The following subchapters provide information related to trends shaping spec -
trum identification for 5G services. 
5G Spectrum Needs 
When considering future spectrum demand of mobile technologies, 5G technologies and their different industry verticals should be considered. The technologies should scale from low spectrum bands for best coverage, to millimeter-wave (mmW) bands—those above 24 GHz—for enhanced performance, and be designed for licensed, unlicensed, and shared licensed spectrum. Using different spectrum bands makes it possible for 5G wireless services to have various levels of reliability, data rates, mobility, and la -
tencies, as required for different use cases. Thus, it is possible to dynamically create services, deployments, or verticals through a configurable connectivity that scales from hotspot deployments to wide area mobile network deployments (see figure 2.1).2.1.

Policy and PlanningINNO VATIVE BUSINESS MODELS FOR EXPA NDING FIBER- OPTIC NETW ORKS AND CL OSING THE ACCESS GAPS29
Given the wide range of expected use cases for 
mobile technologies with the emergence of 5G, as well as the variety of characteristics and strengths of different spectrum bands and spectrum licensing models, a one-size-fits-all approach for 5G spectrum assignment is unlikely. Thus, it will be increasingly important for regulators to offer hybrid spectrum assignment options that allow access to multiple spectrum bands, potentially using a range of as -
signment and licensing approaches that enable the continued development and growth of wireless broadband technologies and services.
In addition, countries may need to rethink how they 
calculate their spectrum needs prior to the intro -
duction of 5G—taking advantage of international trends in identification of spectrum for IMT services. 5G will require the use of higher frequency bands with larger channel bandwidths. Unlike 4G and 3G technologies, which use lower frequency channels, calculating frequency reuse for 5G may pose chal -
lenges for policy makers because of different needs. Specifically, reuse will be much greater in the higher frequencies that will be used for 5G than in any other band previously used for mobile broadband services, enabling providers to reuse a channel in locations as close as only a few meters in some cases.

4 Services with a primary allocation in a band are protected from interference created by services with a secondary allocation in the band.The development of 5G will require licensing new spectrum bands, notably mmW spectrum, such as in the 26 GHz and 28 GHz bands. Taking account of particular market conditions, making such spectrum available as soon as possible can position countries as leaders in 5G and development of the Internet of Things (IoT). Conversely, delaying mmW spectrum availability for mobile broadband may result in delayed access to the full benefits of 5G.
As has been true in earlier phases of spectrum 
planning for mobile services, detailed and transpar -
ent spectrum planning for 5G will increase certainty for investors. Investors who are considering com -
mitments of millions—or even billions—of dollars to obtain spectrum licenses and deploy networks rely on clearly defined and stable rules and plans for the allocation and use of spectrum in order to make resource allocation decisions. Therefore, the policies and plans developed by governments and regulators have a direct impact on investor interest in commit -
ting resources to the development or expansion of a country’s wireless networks.
Bands Under Study for Future 
IMT Identification
In accordance with decisions made at the 2015 
World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-15), several bands will be analyzed and considered for IMT identification at WRC-19 (see figure 2.2).
3 A band 
must have a primary allocation for mobile service in order to be identified for IMT, which may be on a national, regional, or worldwide basis.

These higher bands, above 24 GHz, are expected to provide capacity enhancements and spectrum reuse needed to achieve the goals described in the recommendation. The ITU notes that IMT-2020 should continue to contribute to efforts including expanding connectivity, evolving the ICT market, bridging the digital divide, creating new forms of education, and promoting energy efficiency. Key IMT-2020 capabilities will include enhanced mobile broadband, ultrareliable and low latency communications, and massive machine type communications.

Spectrum Trading
Rather than rely solely on direct licensing of spec -
trum, policy makers are also increasingly adopting 
rules to permit spectrum trading through secondary markets. Secondary markets for spectrum—or the ability of licensees to resell or lease their licensed spectrum—are becoming more prevalent. Since spectrum is a valuable and limited resource, govern -
ments have a duty to secure its optimal use in the in -
terests of citizens and consumers. By making it easier for spectrum to migrate to those that can generate the greatest value for society, spectrum trading can play a central role in achieving this goal. Secondary markets work by creating economic incentives for licensees to use spectrum efficiently or trade it to others. To enable the market to work effectively, it is important to keep transaction costs low, including those attributable to complying with regulation, as well as reducing the time taken to execute transac -
tions (Ofcom 2011). The regulator’s role regarding secondary markets shifts from a hands-on manage -
ment approach to oversight and possible approval of transactions in order to avoid market imbalances, while continuing to monitor compliance with license terms and addressing disputes.
By allowing interested parties to sell, lease, subdivide, 
or combine their spectrum use rights with minimal regulatory intervention, regulators improve regulato -
ry flexibility and allow licensees to respond to market developments without the need for a new govern -
ment-sponsored tender process.32
Source: Ofcom 2013.The United Kingdom, for example, has largely ad -
opted rules allowing the total or partial sale and/or 
leasing of spectrum. Ofcom reported in 2013 that 84 percent of the relevant spectrum was negotiable or tradable, a drastic increase in less than a decade (Ofcom 2013).
7 Figure 2.4 shows the evolution of the 
proportion of U.K. spectrum tradable in secondary markets between the years 2005 and 2013.
Secondary markets can also come with their own 
risks and challenges. For example, market players may not take advantage of spectrum trading. Rather than lease or sell spectrum to competitors, a licensee may choose to hoard its spectrum holdings to restrict market entry. Spectrum trading could also harm competition if dominant players buy up spectrum licenses held by smaller operators, leading to high market concentration. However, regulatory frameworks can be structured so as to control for these challenges and allow the secondary spectrum market to function effectively.
7 Ofcom’s definition excludes uses for which trading is not relevant, namely amateurs and ships, aeronautical, program making and special events 
(PMSE), police and fire, license exempt, and science and technology.Spectrum Sharing Approaches
Shared spectrum is a newer approach that multiple 
countries are pursuing as a means to offer additional spectrum for wireless broadband services. Such approaches may be used where licensed spectrum is not available, or feasible in the long term. Spectrum sharing is enabled by technical methods that, in some cases, involve complementary regulatory ac -
tions to allow their use. It is reasonable to expect that each of the approaches towards spectrum sharing will receive additional attention as 5G technologies continue to develop. 
Spectrum sharing offers new options for expanding 
the quantity of spectrum available for mobile broad -
band. Regulators can implement spectrum sharing through various approaches, including license exempt, Licensed Shared Access (LSA), or licensed regulatory frameworks. 
 •License-exempt approaches have successfully allowed spectrum sharing for applications such as RLANs, Bluetooth, and wireless microphones. 
 •LSA is a relatively new construct in which cur -
rently licensed spectrum can be shared with a limited number of licensed users that conform to predefined conditions that protect the incumbent while enabling additional users access to the same spectrum. LSA is likely to benefit from dynamic approaches to spectrum sharing, in particular.

Overall, sharing permits multiple users to use the 
same spectrum by leveraging technology that elimi -
nates or minimizes interference. This enables sharing of licensed spectrum through the development of a spectrum commons by mutual agreement. In turn, the users manage their spectrum access, not the government. Thus, the authorization of secondary spectrum use enables opportunistic spectrum access whereby technology permits users to access spec -
trum based on the characteristics of use at a specific time and location. Rather than focus on power limits to eliminate or minimize harmful interference, secondary spectrum usage focuses on limiting use to particular locations or times.
Some such approaches rely upon the creation or 
existence of an inventory or database of spectrum usage by band, location, and time. As noted by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), spectrum inventories enable assessment of possible spectrum supply to accom -
modate new applications, the possibilities— in line with overall policy—of shared use in each band (OECD 2014). A spectrum inventory brings the added benefit of providing a useful tool for overall evalua -
tion of spectrum usage, highlighting not only oppor -
tunities for sharing, but also for use in determining if spectrum resources are being used efficiently.
In certain instances, regulators are allowing sec -
ondary use of spectrum on a shared basis in order 
to address some market distortions. In these cases, licensed spectrum is made available for use by an entity other than the primary licensee, as long as that entity’s operations do not interfere with the primary licensee’s services or claim any right to protection from the primary licensee.
In South Africa, for example, the National Integrated 
ICT Policy proposes the concept of “nationalizing spectrum,” if it is assigned under a national license but is not in use (Department of Telecommunications and Postal Services 2014). The proposed goal is to make spectrum available in rural areas. By “nation -
alizing spectrum,” the government intends to allow local governments and communities in certain rural areas to use spectrum previously assigned to mobile operators. The South African government, through this proposal, seeks to address a situation found in certain countries where there are large unserved or underserved rural areas because operators with nationwide licenses do not deploy networks in areas deemed economically unviable. South Africa’s proposal is still at an early stage, but the outcome of this process could be a useful reference for those governments facing a similar situation.
The various approaches to spectrum sharing have 
opened up new opportunities for making the most efficient and effective use of limited spectrum re -
sources while enhancing and expanding broadband capacity.
License-Exempt Spectrum Use
Countries have also introduced regulations to allow unlicensed or “license-exempt” spectrum use to foster innovative applications and services. With lower cost and easier market entry, the license-ex -
empt approach provides opportunities to promote new services and applications and make projects in challenging environments more economically attractive or feasible. A large number of technologies and products typically fall into the license-exempt category, such as Wi-Fi networks, smart devices, radiofrequency identification (RFID), Bluetooth, com -
munications between vehicles, and alarm systems. 
The regulatory framework for unlicensed use usually 
consists of: (i) technical rules to avoid interference; (ii) standards and technical specifications to ensure that quality equipment is being used; and (iii) compliance oversight to ensure that rules are being followed. In certain instances, the regulator may impose some registration requirements, but often this is avoided in order for the regulator to avoid imposing require -
ments similar to licensing.34
Uses of Unlicensed Spectrum
Perhaps most commonly considered in the 
broadband context as an enabler for in-home or intracampus Wi-Fi networks, spectrum used on an unlicensed basis continues to generate new options for expanding access to Internet service. Below are three approaches countries are taking to promote broadband adoption via unlicensed spectrum. 
COMMUNITY NETWORKSOne use case for unlicensed spectrum—usually em -
ploying Wi-Fi, but sometimes simple 2G mobile net -
works—is the development of community networks. 
These are small networks usually built and operated by community members or entrepreneurs to serve a village or town, meant to complement or fill gaps in commercial mobile networks. These bottom-up networks provide service tailored to the needs of particular communities, enhancing connectivity and promoting both access to and creation of local content and services (Internet Society 2017a; 2017b). However, community networks generally have not been a component of sector policies, and regulations have often not been developed to accommodate them. Policy makers seeking to foster community networks may need to review current policy and legal frameworks in order to identify obstacles to the development of such networks. These could include, for example, allowing secondary use of spectrum on a shared basis by an entity other than the primary licensee, provided that entity’s operations do not interfere with the primary licensee’s services or claim any right to protection from the primary licensee.
Examples of successful community networks lever-
aging unlicensed spectrum discussed in chapter 5 include Project Isizwe and Village Telco deployed in

Puerto Rico, Timor Leste, and Brazil. Conversely, lack of flexible rules to allow access to spectrum resources for some community network models such as Endaga, further discussed in chapter 5, has represented a significant barrier to their successful implementation. 
TELEVISION WHITE SPACETelevision White Space (TVWS) is also allowed on an 
unlicensed basis in various countries. This concept allows frequencies unused in a particular geographic area during a specific timeframe to be used for other purposes. Some countries, such as Canada, Colombia, and South Africa have allowed the use of television channels on a secondary basis for backhaul connections in rural areas where television channels are not used.
8
Usually, TVWS solutions are connected to a Wi-Fi access network to reach the end user. Given the secondary status of such use, no guarantee of protection or availability exists if licensed TV stations decide to use this spectrum to broadcast their pro -
gramming. However, this secondary use also creates the possibility to use the spectrum for low or no spectrum fees. In this situation, some business cases are being developed for local/community projects using Wi-Fi access frequencies that are unlicensed with an alternative backhaul solution through TVWS. 
For example, the 4Afrika initiative launched by 
Microsoft, further discussed in chapter 5.2, has involved pilots in over 15 African countries, such as Kenya, South Africa, Namibia, Tanzania, and Ghana, leveraging TVWS to deliver low-cost, high-speed, wireless broadband in rural communities. Similarly, beginning in 2016 and funded at least through 2019, a community project in central Colombia is bringing INNO VATIVE BUSINESS MODELS FOR EXPA NDING FIBER- OPTIC NETW ORKS AND CL OSING THE ACCESS GAPS35
Internet connectivity enabled by TVWS and Wi-Fi 
technology to coffee growers and community schools in rural and remote areas.

LTE-U AND LTE LAA
LTE-U in unlicensed bands as a standalone service is 
designed to operate in bands such as 5 GHz globally, or 3.5 GHz in the United States. It was created to extend the benefits of Long-Term Evolution (LTE) technology used in commercial mobile networks and its ecosystem to Wi-Fi entities that may not own licensed spectrum, such as small Internet service pro-viders using fixed wireless broadband and enterprise or venue owners.
LTE Licensed-Assisted Access (LAA) is designed to 
enable LTE over short distances in the last mile. It also operates in unlicensed bands but is designed to com-bine LTE in unlicensed spectrum with LTE in licensed bands, and thus requires both licensed and unli-censed bands to operate. This aggregation of spec-trum provides for more bandwidth with faster data rates and a more responsive user experience. LTE-U/LAA is intended to deliver better network performance and an enhanced user experience compared to Wi-Fi offloading, providing mobile operators a solution for making better use of unlicensed spectrum.
While Wi-Fi is one of the best-known uses of unli -
censed spectrum, emerging technologies such as 
LTE-U and LAA are leveraging the experiences and benefits of both licensed and unlicensed spectrum in an effort to create a hybrid approach and expand the reach of wireless broadband services. LTE-U and LAA trials are being conducted in markets in Asia, Europe, and the United States.

http://makaia.org/en/projects/technology-for-social-change/technology-transformation-improving-the-lives-of-colombian-coffee-growers/ .RISKS AND CHALLENGES
While unlicensed spectrum does not involve spec -
trum assignments, either directly or indirectly, such 
use nonetheless poses risks and challenges, includ -
ing increased network congestion and the lack of protection against harmful interference. For instance, bands used for Wi-Fi applications are also utilized for a wide variety of applications via wireless phones, Bluetooth, RFID and other short-range devices. With increased use of these kinds of applications, the likelihood of interference also grows. In an effort to mitigate these risks, many users have migrated from the 2.4 GHz band to the 5 GHz band. In addition, unlicensed bands can make it impractical for policy makers to reclaim spectrum for licensed use if national needs or priorities change. Because there is no licensing or registration, equipment operating in an unlicensed band could be hard to locate and/or replace or deactivate in a band-clearing process. This can be exacerbated where large numbers of devices have been purchased and are in use. 
The increasing use of unlicensed spectrum for 
end-user broadband connectivity may also pose a challenge in terms of shifting how a regulator or government approaches its spectrum management role. Because unlicensed spectrum does not generate license revenue and reduces the regulatory manage-ment and administration burden, it may be a signifi-cant change from past approaches in which regula-tory authorities closely controlled spectrum use and imposed license fees to support the related adminis-trative role. To the extent that license fees have been used to generate revenue or cross-subsidize other regulatory or government activities, increased use of unlicensed spectrum may impact such frameworks. As such, the embrace of unlicensed spectrum requires consideration of the impact on the regulator’s role in governing spectrum use in the affected bands, as well as the impact on the agency’s budget.36
Potential Future Unlicensed 
Spectrum Identifications
Wi-Fi networks are seen as an important tool to 
foster Internet access to end users. Public places, such as restaurants and cafes, and more recently, state-financed projects, are providing free or subsi -
dized Internet access to citizens. Even local operators are beginning to use Wi-Fi networks to provide more affordable Internet connectivity. In addition, Wi-Fi networks are becoming standard in not only com -
munications devices, but in automobiles, electronics, household appliances, medical devices, and other equipment that traditionally has not been connected. The incorporation of Wi-Fi connectivity into noncom -
munications devices is a key enabler of the IoT, with a growing number of home and business devices sending and receiving Internet traffic. 
Wi-Fi uses spectrum on an unlicensed basis in 
specific bands that are also used by other applica -
tions, such as Bluetooth and RFID. The bands most frequently used for such applications are the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. Radiocommunications services operating in these bands must accept harmful inter -
ference; may not claim protection against harmful interference; and are subject to power limits to avoid causing interference to other services.
10 No identifica -
tion exists for this type of application in the ITU Radio Regulations. Instead, ITU recommendations and reports seek to harmonize spectrum used by RLANs on an unlicensed basis.
11
WRC-19 will also look at the possibility of modifying existing allocations and technical restrictions in 
10 For example, the 5 GHz band was designated for such use by Resolution 229 (WRC-12), https://www.itu.int/oth/R0A06000018/en .
11 ITU-R Recommendation M.1450 (April 2014), Table 2, https://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-M.1450/en .
12 WRC Resolution 239 (WRC-15), “Studies Concerning Wireless Access Systems Including Radio Local Area Networks in the Frequency Bands 
Between 5 150 MHz and 5 925 MHz,” ( https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-r/oth/0c/0a/R0C0A00000C0017PDFE.pdf ) invites WRC-19 to take up this 
issue. It will be addressed under WRC-19 Agenda Item 1.16.
13 In particular, the ITU is studying the frequency bands 5150-5350 MHz (outdoor), 5350-5470 MHz, 5725-5850 MHz and 5850-5925 MHz.
14 See ITU-R Resolution 229 (Rev. WRC-12), “Use of the Bands 5 150-5 250 MHz, 5 250-5 350 MHz and 5 470-5 725 MHz by the Mobile Service for the Implementation of Wireless Access Systems Including Radio Local Area Networks,” https://www.itu.int/oth/R0A06000018 .order to make more spectrum available for RLANs.12 
The focus is to expand the 5 GHz band for RLAN 
applications, and to relax some technical restrictions (for example, power limits) applicable to certain ranges of the band.
13 Any such changes at WRC-19, 
once implemented at the national level, will expand the spectrum resources available to Wi-Fi-enabled connectivity projects, in line with those detailed in chapter 5.2.
In particular, the current 5 GHz bands for RLANs have 
a gap between 5350 MHz and 5470 MHz.
14 This gap 
limits capacity by impeding the creation of larger channels that would allow the transport of more data and strengthen against interference. To continue promoting Internet adoption, policy makers should follow the WRC-19 process and outcomes and plan for additional unlicensed spectrum to facilitate Wi-Fi deployments.
Spectrum Repurposing and 
Refarming
In an effort to maximize the use of spectrum and 
thereby better address spectrum demand from relevant stakeholders, regulators are undertaking administrative, financial, and technical measures to recapture spectrum and reassign it for new uses. Spectrum repurposing and refarming is not a new concept, but it is one vehicle that takes on even greater relevance as countries seek to make more spectrum available to meet mobile broadband demand. Such approaches have considered both spectrum used for existing mobile technologies INNO VATIVE BUSINESS MODELS FOR EXPA NDING FIBER- OPTIC NETW ORKS AND CL OSING THE ACCESS GAPS37
(that is, 2G, 3G, and 4G) and spectrum used by other 
services. Recent refarming undertakings and consul -
tations have addressed several bands, including the 450 MHz, 900 MHz, and 1800 MHz bands used for earlier mobile technologies and the repurposing of mid-range bands such as the 2.5 GHz and 3.5 GHz bands, as well as the 700 MHz and 800 MHz bands previously used for terrestrial television broadcasting. Refarming will enable operators to pursue the mix of low-, mid-, and high-band spectrum that is most ap -
propriate for their deployment and business models.
One high-profile repurposing target has been 
driven by the migration of television broadcasting from analog to digital transmission, which enables the provision of improved television services while using less spectrum. The spectrum that can be repurposed from analog broadcasting to other uses—referred to as the digital dividend—has been earmarked by many policy makers for the provision of mobile broadband services. In fact, the creation of the digital dividend has been a major driver of the digital broadcasting migration around the world. The digital television migration and the resulting availability of the digital dividend is critically important for the continued growth and improvement of mobile broadband services around the world. 
Digital Dividend—International 
and Regional Developments
In the European Union, the European Commission 
(EC), the European Parliament, and the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) have developed recommenda -
tions and plans for the harmonized implementation of the digital dividend across the continent.
15 
15 See, for example, Decision 2010/267/EC on Harmonized Technical Conditions of Use in the 790-862 MHz Frequency Band for Terrestrial Systems 
Capable of Providing Electronic Communications Services in the European Union (May 6, 2010),      http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32010D0267 .

and Asia-Pacific Telecommunity, “APT Recommendation on ‘Frequency Arrangements for the Implementation of IMT in the Band 698-806 MHz,” Document APT/AWG/REC-08 (December 2016).Following the first digital dividend in the 800 MHz 
band, the EC, European Parliament, and the Council of the European Union agreed in December 2016 on an EU-wide approach for the use of the 470-790 MHz band, including the 700 MHz band (694-790 MHz) (European Commission 2016). Under the agreement, the 700 MHz band is to be assigned to mobile operators and made available for wireless broadband use by the end of June 2020. EU Member States were expected to conclude crossborder coordination agreements by the end of 2017, and to adopt and publish their plans by June 2018. 
In addition, several Region 3 countries have identified 
the 698-790 MHz band for use by IMT, and all of Region 3 has identified 790-960 MHz for IMT.
16 In 
September 2010, the Asia Pacific Telecommunity (APT) Wireless Forum (AWF) defined the so-called APT700 plan as the most efficient arrangement of the digital dividend for mobile services. In December 2016, the APT approved a recommendation encour -
aging administrations to adopt a harmonized band plan for IMT in the 698-806 MHz band. However, the APT700 plan had already gained worldwide support by the time that the APT released its recommendation.
17
Notably, countries in Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East, such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, the Arab Republic of Egypt, France, Germany, Panama, Peru, Mexico, Suriname, and the United Arab Emirates have already awarded spectrum based on the APT700 plan or are preparing to do so, expanding the potential market for compati -
ble equipment beyond the Asia-Pacific region. Recent and upcoming examples of digital dividend refarming are presented in table 2.1.38

Spectrum-Specific Principles
Taking into account the trends and observations 
noted above, and in considering how best to leverage spectrum resources to ensure effective and efficient use that improves and expands Internet access, the following core set of spectrum principles were used to develop the recommendations set forth in chapter 7.
1. Leverage flexibility to enable the introduction 
and growth of emerging technologies, no -
tably 5G and the IoT.  Although 5G technology 
has been in development for several years and IoT devices and services are already in use, both technologies are expected to experience considerable further development and growth. Regulators and policy makers should ensure that their actions not only do not constrain such growth, but rather facilitate and encourage it, building frameworks that maximize flexibility, enable innovation, minimize administrative burdens, and take into account the characteris -
tics that make these technologies different from earlier innovations. These new technologies will both enable novel, flexible uses of spectrum, and also benefit from regulatory flexibility in consid -
ering the rules and policies that govern their deployment.
2. Maximize spectrum access for wireless broad -
band services. Demand for wireless broadband services has continued to grow unabated, driven in part by the continuing improvement of wireless technologies and their new applications, and the increasing ability to use spectrum flexibly to serve different needs and users. Policy makers and regulators seeking to expand access to broadband should keep in mind that the most important method by which to increase capacity and improve the user experience is to ensure the availability of appropriate spectrum for use by wireless broadband services, although competi -
tion or concentration concerns should be taken into account as well. Increasing the amount of available spectrum is even more important when considering the new connected applications supported by IoT. Identification of bands and transparency regarding the amount and availabil -
ity of spectrum must be accompanied by appro -
priate—and sufficiently flexible—licensing and access models that are aligned with the likely use cases of the spectrum under consideration. In addition, regulatory frameworks should facilitate flexible use, allowing for pooling and sharing, to maximize use and efficiency, while at the same time promoting competition.
3. Implement strategies specifically targeting unserved and underserved populations.  
Reaching areas and populations that continue to lack adequate—or any—broadband access will require new, more flexible approaches and reconsideration of the role of government. The advent of new wireless technologies with differ -
ent characteristics and use cases than existing mobile networks should prompt actions that can strengthen existing successful approaches and leverage new technologies, business models, and spectrum authorization approaches to provide governments and regulators with a flexible set of tools with which to develop new sector strategies.INNO VATIVE BUSINESS MODELS FOR EXPA NDING FIBER- OPTIC NETW ORKS AND CL OSING THE ACCESS GAPS41
The Dilemma of Fiber Replacing Copper vs. Upgrading Copper
Driven by a mix of competitive forces and public 
policy initiatives, incumbent operators in many markets came under increasing pressure in the last decade to replace their copper access network with fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) technology. The technology itself was never the main cost issue. Instead, the expensive roll-out of the technology made the pay-off a long-term—and often uncertain—prospect. The presence of existing copper plant was also an enor -
mous disincentive to new infrastructure investment. Hence, many incumbents opted for the short-term fix of upgrading the copper initially to very high speed digital subscriber line (VDSL) technology (or even variants such as G-fast) to delay the heavy invest -
ment in all-fiber solutions. In markets where copper infrastructure is limited or practically non-existent, this dilemma is not a key issue. However, in others, this is a central challenge that policy makers have had to contend with either through regulation, incentives, or more active forms of intervention in deployment business models (see box 2.1). 
Box 2.1: The 3Ws - Whether, When and Where - to Upgrade from Copper to Fiber
Figure B2.1.1: The Case for Upgrading to FiberOver the past decade, telecommunications incumbents with significant copper infrastructure (such as BT and Deutsche Telekom) have been wrestling with these questions in the face of the growing conflict between lack of incentive to abandon an existing productive asset and the uncertainty of the additional revenue that could be gained with fiber on the one hand, and the need to slow down the churn to newer, leaner competitors on the other. 
The main dilemma for incumbents is whether to upgrade the copper or go directly to fiber. As depicted 
in the idealized case below, the total cost of upgrading from copper to fiber is more expensive than go -
ing straight to fiber. However, in these calculations the factors of better cash flow by delayed investment and risk management are not considered. 2.2. Evolution and the Role of New T echnology Trends

Table 2.3: Evolution of Fixed Access TechnologiesThe case for evolving xDSL networks is instructive for 
the general case where fixed broadband networks can be upgraded gradually to accommodate higher speed and capacity requirements. Competitive con -
siderations usually drive the need to upgrade while economic considerations from the cost of upgrading and price evolution in the technology ecosystem make some upgrades unattractive. In these circum -
stances, the operator has a choice to maintain the existing network or transition to fiber.
Table 2.3 below describes likely transitions for the 
different fixed access technologies:

Network technology evolution is subject to many considerations: competitive environment, technolo -
gy-specific concessions, speed of market evolution, cash-flow implications and investment capacity of operators and state of existing networks. 
Transitioning to a fiber solution is associated with:
 •Technology is mature so costs are stable : 
Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON) equipment costs have evolved and prices have 
decreased to a stable level, so there is more certainty on the Optical Line Termination (OLT) port and Optical Network Terminal (ONT) costs per user.
 •Last mile distances and network quality : All 
networks have differences in the quality of the final infrastructure link to customers in terms of quality and distance or density. While copper 
Source: TMG/Salience Consulting.INNO VATIVE BUSINESS MODELS FOR EXPA NDING FIBER- OPTIC NETW ORKS AND CL OSING THE ACCESS GAPS43
networks critically depend on short distances, 
fiber networks are much more robust to changes in cable length.
 •Ability to mitigate capital costs : Any replace -
ment of a coaxial cable/DOCSIS or copper/xDSL network with fiber to the home will require signif -
icant installation of new lines with the associated high initial capital cost. This can be mitigated by reuse of existing ducts and fiber network. This cost can be amortized over a long period as no competing fixed network technologies are on the horizon.
 •Higher takeup/high ARPU/high density : 
Because the backhaul/middle mile is a shared cost, high-density environments are economically more attractive for upgrades. In many countries, density is also correlated with higher ARPU and higher takeup rates—all positively affecting the case for upgrade.
 •Increased consumption of content and other value-added services: Even though the impact varies on the revenue side, there is a clear trend of increased consumption of content and value-added services. While many telecommuni -
cations operators are benefiting from this trend, there may be cases where operators are not the primary beneficiaries, for example, provision of over-the-top services.
In addition to these choices among access technolo -
gies, broadband networks will continue to be impact -
ed by a number of significant general trends:
 •Core network usage increase : Since most 
Internet service is provided on the basis of unlimited use, and users are connecting and increasingly using more and more devices, overall usage—and therefore core network costs—is growing. At the same time, revenue remains relatively fixed, which must be offset against higher subscriber numbers, higher ARPU, and lower costs. This is not always achievable.
 •High IP transit prices : Broadband networks 
critically depend on international IP connections. Countries may have very high Internet connec -
tivity prices (IPT) that represent a substantial cost in the overall equation, especially in the face of growing usage. This usually affects landlocked countries or those where demand has not justified landing of competitive subsea cables.
 •Higher churn and competition : Introducing 
new technology is often triggered by compe -
tition. Higher churn and a highly competitive environment might have a negative effect on the incumbent and challenger business cases.
 •Lower takeup/low ARPU/low density : Countries 
with lower affordability generally have lower take -
up and pay less on average. Unfortunately, a lot of countries in this category have many remote, low-density areas, which makes the case for fixed broadband networks more difficult. Shared networks, wireless access and regulatory support may help, which is the main topic of this report.
 •Political pressure (local and regional) : 
Broadband announcements can be used for political purposes (for example, Australia NBN) and regional pressure relating to concerns about being left behind (for example, the EU’s Gigabit Society). These external pressures may not always be supported by a sound economic rationale but may affect decision making.
A more detailed summary of the economics of the upgrade steps in terms of OPEX and CAPEX are also shown in figure 2.5 below. If the CAPEX investment could be absorbed, then upgrades will improve the relative profit margins as both VDSL and fiber will open the door for additional services (content, VAS) and fiber will significantly reduce the network opera -
tion costs.44

In line with best practice, determining where to up -
grade should be conducted via neighborhood-based 
variations of the general business case and doing phased, but targeted, rollout. Where there is suffi -
cient expected take-up with relatively higher ARPU in the specific area, then upgrading straight to FTTH is recommended. In contrast, if the take-up is uncertain, then a step-by-step upgrade through VDSL and a “sweating the copper” attitude is a more reasonable approach.The state can also shift the calculations in fiber’s favor by undertaking actions to reduce fiber CAPEX. Some of these actions simply involve removing regulatory barri-ers (as discussed in the Recommendations Section in chapter 7). Others could involve coinvestment or sub-sidy, if justified, on a cost-benefit basis that takes into consideration incremental economic benefits of fiber over existing copper ADSL or VDSL, or coax/DOCSIS. Some have even advocated for more aggressive fiber switchover policies (Stanislawski and Krauze 2012).

High-Speed Mobile Broadband—
Fixed Access Substitute or Complement?
Mobile network operators have played, and continue 
to play, an important role in increasing Internet connectivity. Since the beginning of 2010, the num-ber of mobile Internet subscribers has increased by 2.3 billion, 75 percent of whom live in low- and middle-income countries and were accessing the Internet for the first time.
18 The planned investment 
of an additional $900 billion between 2016 and 2020 is expected to bring Internet access to an additional one billion people. In most developing countries and rural areas in the developed countries, mobile is the dominant form of broadband delivery. Even in markets with extensive fixed networks, the advances of mobile broadband technology from 3G to 4G and 5G, along with the increase in the data rates they bring, have presented an opportunity to substitute mobile technology for fixed line access. This is mainly because of the fact that mobile networks tend to be quicker and less costly to deploy and, thus, more prof-itable for telecommunications operators as compared to upgrading or extending their fixed line networks. 
Mobile operators have leveraged widespread de -
ployment together with affordability and ease of use 
as an opportunity to not only substitute the fixed line but extend the service capability into household broadband, usually delivered via a plug-in dongle containing a SIM card. 
Fixed wireless technologies have been present for 
decades—operators unable to provide efficient and affordable fixed line network access have been deliv -
ering a substitute through WiMAX, and more recently LTE fixed wireless technology. From the technology perspective, although WiMAX is near the end of its lifecycle, LTE is expected to last over the long term. For example, ongoing 3GPP standardization efforts 
18 Comments received from GSMA (Q1 2018).that ensure backward compatibility between devices and easy integration are helping to lengthen LTE’s lifecycle.
Wi-Fi has also been evolving from a predominantly 
indoor technology covering homes and businesses to an outdoor technology covering whole cities, such as in Barcelona and Singapore. The solution has received wide acceptance because of the fact that, in many countries, Wi-Fi does not require any specific spectrum license and because Wi-Fi is installed in everyday devices. Wi-Fi is discussed in more detail in chapter 5.3. 
However, mobile broadband technologies have two 
fundamental issues: 1) their performance is subject to spectrum availability and not comparable with the speed of fiber; and 2) as a common access resource, the cell capacity is shared between a variable number of end users, therefore making service level guaran -
tees of the type available with fiber challenging. For these reasons, mobile broadband continues to be perceived as complementary to fixed line broadband in developed markets, rather than as a substitute.
Growth in Subsea Fiber 
Deployments
Improvements in fiber and transmission technology 
has not only impacted terrestrial connectivity but has also enabled exponential growth in subsea cable capacity. The emergence of new subsea cables or upgrades to existing ones in synergy with increased local competition and growing volumes have led to falling prices throughout the world. Figure 2.6 illustrates the drop in international IP transit prices on major global routes over the past few years.46
Figure 2.6: Median 10GigE IP Transit Prices in Key Cities, 2014-17
Source: Salience Consulting using TeleGeography data.
Despite the overall drop in prices, the cost of global 
connectivity still varies widely, with countries in the southern hemisphere paying significantly higher prices (figure 2.7). IP transit costs under $1 per Mbps per month in London, New York, and Los Angeles and about $2 in Singapore and Tokyo. In contrast, IP transit could cost $9 in Johannesburg and more than $15 elsewhere in Africa. Still, the overall picture is one of significantly greater capacity and cheaper prices throughout the world. 
In many countries in the developing world, a vir -
tuous circle of higher volumes-lower costs-lower 
prices-higher volumes has been created by ensuring greater capacity on subsea cables is translated into domestic markets through implementing open access regimes to break the bottlenecks at cable landing stations. Expansion of terrestrial crossborder networks is also relevant, as these networks can further assist in aggregating traffic, driving costs down and volumes up. Indeed, there may be ten -
sions created for specific landing stations in certain smaller countries, which could see national traffic flows drawn to lower-cost landing facilities in larger adjacent nations. 
Finally, it is important to note that for landlocked 
countries, the full benefits provided by subsea cables are only realized when crossborder interconnection is available and reasonably priced. Many of the proj -
ects reviewed were initiated by policy makers seeking to address a lack of interconnection or private enterprise seeing the opportunity in the absence of this interconnection.$20

Future Satellite Constellations 
and Satellite Broadband – Will They Deliver on the Promise?
With investments from satellite heavyweights, such 
as Boeing, Qualcomm, Virgin, and SpaceX, the race to cover the globe with new satellite constellations is heating up. The upfront investment in these enterpris-es is high—in the billions of dollars. However, satellite operators are targeting vast new markets, including the billions of people currently without broadband service and opportunities to expand access limits for current users, for example, from full broadband functionality for air travel to rich niche markets serving high-end business and government customers. This is incentivizing the ambitious rollout. The new push for satellite broadband is enabled by new technology. Recent and future deployments are quite different to prior satellite systems with high-throughput satellites (HTS) and nongeostation-ary Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) constellations.
High-throughput satellites exploiting frequency reuse 
and spot beam technology are providing broadband capabilities unavailable from satellite systems in the past. Broadband satellite service has proven to be a viable business and several new HTS systems have been launched recently, with more planned. Avanti Eco is one example of an initiative to rollout HTS ser-vice in rural communities in Africa. Avanti Eco’s busi-ness model benefits from an initial contribution from the European Space Agency and links communities,

service providers, and private and/or public partners 
to ensure ongoing affordability through subsidy. 
Another new approach is represented by new LEO 
and MEO technologies, which offer significant im-provements over high-orbit, geostationary connectiv-ity in terms of lower latency and higher capacity and performance. Also, the new LEO and MEO satellites being developed by the likes of OneWeb and SpaceX are mass-manufactured at a much lower cost than more traditional satellite technologies. No LEO broad-band constellations have been launched yet.
Some relative newcomers who have been applying 
new technologies over recent years, such as O3b, have achieved notable accomplishments in interna-tional connectivity markets, but their lofty ambitions have yet to be realized. 
Satellite broadband connectivity based on HTS and 
O3b’s MEO system have proven useful in breaking bottlenecks in wholesale backhaul, as well as provid-ing useful niche carrier wholesale, enterprise, and consumer applications. While broadband traffic car-ried through satellites is forecast to grow at a similar pace as terrestrial networks, it will remain as a niche segment. Because nonstationary technologies are still nascent, the future will judge their success and wheth-er they will deliver the promise of affordable Internet for the billions of unserved people around the world.
Exploiting the Gaps—TV White 
Space Providing Broadband Connectivity
As noted above, TVWS refers to wireless technology 
that utilizes unused television channels, between the active ones, in the VHF and UHF spectrum. These are typically referred to as the “buffer” channels. In the past, these buffers were placed between active TV channels to prevent broadcasting interference. It has since been demonstrated that this unused spectrum can be used to provide broadband Internet access while operating harmoniously with surrounding TV channels. In general, the channels are 8 MHz wide, allowing bandwidths of about 20 Mbps per channel, and typically 12 to 40 channels would be available, depending on the regulatory authority. TVWS solu -
tions are not without some controversy, as they are arguably an anomaly resulting from inefficiently allocated spectrum. It may be that, considering the cost and benefits of narrowing these buffer chan -
nels and making more spectrum available, more traditional allocations might offer better solutions for more end-users. See chapters 1 and 5 for more information.
Drones and Balloons Hovering in 
the Sky 
There is currently significant research and develop-
ment in new connectivity platforms to create alterna-tive, long-term, last-mile and middle-mile coverage solutions. These are based on using large balloons (such as Google’s project Loon) or drones (such as the Facebook supported project Aquila) that fly at high altitudes, with each unit covering large areas—from 3,000 to 5,000 square kilometers. Power is generated from solar panels, and light onboard equipment allows for much longer flight times. Both the balloons and the drones are designed to provide coverage over a large area by clustering together with other craft. Only one of the cluster needs wireless ground-based connectivity to provide backhaul connectivity to the rest of the cluster. Individual drones and balloons are designed to come out of circulation about every three months to be replaced by another allowing for continuous coverage over the target zone. Once serviced, they are then returned to the cluster. Just as with the latest ambitious LEOs and MEOs, these technologies are still at a stage where their commer-cial viability and appropriate market niche are still to be revealed.

Technological progress and innovation tend to 
flourish in markets where infrastructure investors and operators can make the economic case for it. This generally means that wealthier nations and larger cities with relatively high-density households were the first recipients of the technological break -
throughs that have made broadband access possible. 
Over the past several years, new business models 
have ensured that these technology achievements are captured for those areas that would not be served through more traditional approaches. Private actors, governments, and international organizations have been finding solutions to the challenges posed by communities who find themselves on the wrong side of the digital divide.
The central purpose of this discussion of business 
models is to assist policy makers in understanding the wide variety of means available to implement infrastructure deployment. It is important to keep in mind the context in which these business models emerge. Of particular significance is when and how the state participates in these initiatives. The various roles that the state plays may have both beneficial and detrimental effects. As has been discussed in other publications (for example, Kelly and Rossotto 2012), there are key steps that the state can take to focus attention, align priorities, and define its role in a positive manner within a national ICT/broadband policy. The first is to ensure that the regulatory framework facilitates deployment. Encouraging entry 
19 Market failure is a situation in which the free market is not delivering services in the quantities they are desired or otherwise inefficiently. There 
are two main types of market failure in broadband infrastructure deployment: abuse of dominance; and missing markets because of scarcity of capital, excessive uncertainty and/or undervaluation of benefits.
20 Some elements that are part of the traditional business model paradigm have not been included, such as value proposition and competition 
strategy, as these are treated as givens of the deployment objectives for each initiative and project reviewed. Furthermore, as the focus of this 
report is infrastructure deployment, the business model analysis will not include such areas as sales and distribution. Clearly, such considerations 
will be significant for a broader study of telecommunications service deployment. See, for example, the case studies of Dialog Telekom, Idea 
Cellular, Millicom, and Roshan in IFC 2012, IFC 2014a, and IFC 2014b as well as USAID 2017 and SSG Advisors 2016.and competition through liberal and technology-neu -
tral licensing, sensible spectrum policy, and open 
access principles where appropriate are key aspects of that framework. Lowering the cost of entry by reducing bureaucratic obstacles is another aspect of good governance that can also promote infrastruc -
ture deployment without directly intervening in the business of infrastructure deployment. These actions alone can go far towards achieving infrastructure objectives by creating the right opportunities for the private sector to marshal resources and apply expertise to make sustainable businesses out of what might be otherwise perceived as market failures.

For the purpose of this report, business model means:

rial, financing , and revenue generation  approaches

infrastructure deployment.20 (see figure 3.1)3. Business Models for Infrastructure

3.2. Market Segment
Segment Options
In terms of business segmentation for infrastructure 
deployment, five relevant options are identified: whole-sale open access; commercial access; passive and net-work active equipment purchased on a wholesale basis; a fully vertically integrated approach; and segmentation based on how the infrastructure is procured.
Wholesale open access refers to a scenario in which 
network layers and network services are provided on an open access basis. Open access means that the terms and conditions of infrastructure service provi-sion are offered on a fair, nondiscriminatory, transpar-ent, and reasonable basis.
21 Open access can be ap-
plied to the physical infrastructure alone, referred to as passive layer open access (PLOA). Or it can be provid-ed in conjunction with services requiring active equip-ment, referred to as active layer open access (ALOA). 
In contrast to open access, “commercial access” refers 
to differential treatment of customers. This differ-
21 In this context, it is assumed that open access can either be imposed by regulation or adopted voluntarily.ential treatment may be simple profit-seeking, such as exploiting different price elasticities of customer demand, or may be conducted with anticompetitive intent. Wholesale network operators offering passive and active infrastructure services and conducting an opportunistic commercial strategy are quite common. 
Another segmentation approach for an operator is to 
make use of passive and network active equipment purchased on a wholesale basis and limit its own infrastructure deployment to that required for retail service provision (RSP). 
Wholesale and retail segments are often provided 
together by a single operator. A fully vertically inte -
grated approach would combine wholesale commer -
cial access and the retail. In concentrated markets, this increases the potential for abuse of market power. However, combining such segments may not pose competitive issues in a multiplayer market or an effectively regulated one.

the creation of state-controlled wholesale-only open 
access entities in an effort to create service-based competition without heavy regulation. This report examines a number of these.
A final dimension to market segmentation is how 
the infrastructure is procured. Wholesale, retail, and vertically integrated may build, lease, or acquire-by-swap their capacities. 
The choice of which segmentation an enterprise pur -
sues may be driven by market opportunity (such as 
the terms on which any existing segment is available) or legal restriction (such as a monopoly granted to a single passive access infrastructure provider).
Relationship to Market 
Structure
The relative merits or possibilities for segmentation 
will depend on market structure. Figure 3.2 illustrates how different segmentation approaches may appear within the context of different market structures. While not an exhaustive representation of the various market structures, figure 3.2 indicates the diversity of relationships that may develop as a result of market and regulatory circumstances: 
 •Market structure 1  depicts a standard infra -
structure-based competition scenario with vertically integrated competing incumbent and new entrants. The terms of network access are irrelevant in this case as operators self-supply. This scenario is often found in the early stages of liberalization, and in mature stages as well in 
developing countries.
 •Market structure 2  shows a relationship in 
which the new entrant(s) relies on the incumbent 
for some network services. These services may be geographically defined (the new entrant using incumbent services in certain areas where the former does not have network) and/or network hierarchy defined (using a self-supplying core network but leasing access network from the incumbent). Where network facilities of the incumbent are a bottleneck, regulators may attempt to impose open access-type conditions to create a level playing field for new entrants.
 •Market structure 3  is found in markets in which 
new entrants have successfully built out their network more extensively than incumbents and can offer incumbents network services. This scenario has been seen throughout the history of successful liberalization policy with examples such as Level 3 in the United States and Interoute in Europe. In markets where state-owned incumbents are weak, this market structure may develop quite rapidly. 
 •Market structures 4, 5, and 6  depict scenarios 
in which a single passive network operator (NetCo), a single NetCo and a single active layer network operator (OpCo), or unified single whole -
sale network service provider (Wholesale OpCo) supply retail service providers. These market structures develop where government creates a de jure monopoly (for example, Singapore effectively creating a Market 5 scenario), or where supply and demand conditions (“white or grey areas” in EU parlance) create a de facto monopoly environment. Given the monopoly nature of these market structures, regulators will typically insist on some form of open access conditions. 
 •Market structures 7, 8, and 9  demonstrate 
scenarios in which the wholesale network opera -
tors are supplying the market on a nonexclusive basis. Service providers make use of the whole -
sale network operators’ infrastructure where necessary, but also may have their own network infrastructure. As long as the government does not legally restrict entry, then market structures 4, 5, and 6 will often evolve into corresponding 7, 8, and 9 scenarios as the virtuous circle of infrastructure deployment and demand mutate market conditions and expand opportunities.54

Lessons Learned
By themselves, none of these options for market 
segmentation is a guarantee of success. Instead, they are heavily dependent on the current and evolving conditions shaping market structure. However, on the basis of the initiatives or project reviewed in this report, some observations can be made. 
The standard model for telecommunications service 
provision is vertical integration. Vertically integrat -
ed entities are responsible for the rollout of the overwhelming majority of broadband infrastructure in the world. Vertically integrated mobile network operators (MNOs) can be credited with the recent transformation of the ICT environment in developing countries. However, they function best in markets where robust infrastructure competition eliminates upstream dominance and the market distortions that such dominance can produce. Thus, vertical integration may not be the answer for thin markets and in nations where regulatory authorities cannot safeguard against anticompetitive behavior. 
Wholesale-only plays, whether implemented on an 
open or commercial access basis, may or may not be a success from a commercial or public policy point of view. For example, wholesale open access fixed networks that are limited to passive infrastructure ap -
pear more prevalent where the commercial limitation to nonactive facilities can be offset by de facto or de jure dominance. In these cases, they are not general -
ly commercially viable for a competitive infrastructure market, nor desirable when market conditions can support effective competition. 
Passive infrastructure plays in the mobile sector, for 
example, TowerCos, have enjoyed much success as they tend to be low cost and have benefited from the evolving MNO model in which operators seek to outsource more network functionality in an effort to reduce cost and focus on retail activities. All other things constant, wholesale OpCos offering both active and passive products enjoy a better business case than their passive only kin. There have been numerous examples of wholesale OpCos op -
erating sustainably at the core network level in even very underdeveloped markets. Fixed access networks in rural areas typically require outside assistance to remain solvent. 
In thin markets where only one open access network 
may be sustained, dynamic efficiency of the entity can be encouraged by requiring unbundling of active and passive products. Giving service providers the oppor -
tunity to self-provide active elements can pressure the wholesale OpCo to keep prices low and innovate as the market requires.
National wholesale mobile infrastructure can be 
established by the state to provide a shared 4G spectrum platform to increase broadband service competition and extend network to un- or under -
served areas. Some instances, such as Mexico’s Red Compartida and the second “phase” of the Rwanda NFON, have been controversial. Given the lower cost of mobile infrastructure deployment, the state should be sure to demonstrate market failure before inter -
vening with an initiative that could crowd out private sector activity.
While recent discussion of wholesale-only models 
has centered around open access networks, a commercial access approach has been the standard for private sector-led wholesale plays. In these cases, even if “carrier neutral,” the operator will be pricing to reflect market conditions. This approach has been highly successful in the rollout of core and backhaul networks. Successful private sector wholesale op -
erators tend to begin to creep into profitable retail markets over time. This can cast doubt on whether they can maintain a nondiscriminatory commercial position in relation to competitors in the retail space.Finally, there are a number of successful examples in developing markets where operators selectively choose how to procure wholesale network elements 56
to serve retail customers. Liquid Telecom, for ex -
ample, has demonstrated a strategy of minimizing 
network duplication in its markets by opportunistical -
ly leasing existing infrastructure, swapping capacity, and acquisitions.The options for market segmentation, examples, and these lessons learned are summarized in table 3.1.

Financing Options
In terms of financing, a business model usually 
involves a combination of approaches. Funding telecommunications infrastructure through private equity or debt is overwhelmingly the most typical case in well-functioning markets. However, where the business cases are built on a narrower basis of profit opportunity, private funding may be problematic. In these cases, the government and communities, which tend to have different assessments of risk and required return than private investors, may have a role to play. State funding of investment in terms of equity or debt is found in the majority of the projects that are reviewed in this report. Community funding from local residents, businesses, and municipalities can play a significant role in filling gaps in the de -
ployment of rural access networks. Vendor financing may be key where more favorable terms are offered with the capital equipment purchase itself. Finally, development financial institution (DFI) funding can be key in markets where capital of any type—private or public—is scarce. 
A taxonomy of financing solutions is presented in 
table 3.2. Again, for any given undertaking, multiple financing tools are usually at play. 58
Lessons Learned
As with the other elements of the business mod -
els, the form of financing alone will not generally 
determine the success or failure of the enterprise. Nonetheless, private financing tends to be associated with faster rollouts. Private equity and debt arrange -
ments can generally be developed in a project-spe -
cific manner to address diverse needs of potential investors, for example, strategic versus institutional. 
Involvement of public financing can impose addi -
tional restrictions on return whereby conditions of 
state aid effectively act as a form of rate regulation. Successful cases involving significant public and/or DFI financing tend to be associated with strong private sector involvement. Separating financing and ownership among public and private entities requires care to avoid inconsistent incentives.
Community financing naturally is small scale and 
limited to small community projects. 
Vendor financing is often found in combination with 
other forms of financing. Vendor only cases tend to be found either where a) the risk profile is too high for private financing and/or b) the vendor is keen to demonstrate the feasibility of new technology and will therefore assume additional risk.

3.4. Management and Operation 
Management Options 
There is a range of options with respect to man -
agement and operation. In buoyant markets, it is 
the private sector that generally designs, builds, operates, and owns the infrastructure. In large-scale deployments covering multiple markets, a private consortium is often established. Privately owned infrastructure may be run in a number of ways, for example, the buildout and the operation may be carried out by different commercial entities.
In thinner markets, there may be cause for some 
form public involvement. One form is for the govern -
ment to run the management of the infrastructure as a public service although, absent the profit incentive, this often leads to poor financial performance. The state management approach (public DBO) represents an extreme case of government intervention. There are some instances in which private-sector capital and technical capabilities are so scarce that there is little or no choice but to rely on heavy government involvement.
Another option is joint management with the private 
sector, which is effectively supervised via a contract, lease, concession, or special purpose vehicle (SPV) with state ownership:
22
 •Contracting, lease, or concession models  are 
approaches in which the state cedes (increasing degrees of) management control to a private contractor. In a service or operate and maintain contract the state pays the contractor to run an existing infrastructure (or a defined service within the overall operation of the infrastructure). Under a lease, the state funds the buildout of the entire network, which is then provided on a 
22 For more detailed discussion see, for example, the typology in the World Bank’s PPP Reference Guide at https://pppknowledgelab.org/guide/
sections/6-ppp-contract-types-and-terminology.set-term lease basis and operated by a private 
contractor. The operating expenses are borne by the contractor, which also collects the wholesale revenues. In return, the contractor pays the leasing fees of the network to the public sector, which remains the owner of the assets. Under a concession, the private contractor may fund the infrastructure build itself. 
 •The special purpose vehicle (SPV)  model is a 
truly integrated cooperation between various public and private stakeholders that have created the new joint venture. Governance, along with the ownership and funding, is shared among public and private entities.
The roles of the public and private sector may change over time as well with, for example, the government playing an initial role to design, construct, and oper -
ate until such time as the market opportunity clarifies and then commercializing the entity. Conversely, the private sector may initially build and operate the network before transferring to the public sector. The Tonga submarine cable initiative is one example in which the public sector initiated and supervised the construction of the cable and ran the company for the first few years until privatizing in 2017.
Lessons Learned
Private sector management and operation gener -
ally proves the most efficient: rollouts tend to be faster and profitability higher. State management is always accompanied by public financing and public ownership, as the private sector and even DFI tend to shy away from state-managed entities. Because the public sector finances, manages, and owns the 60
network, all of the financial, operational, and com -
mercial risks are borne by the government. There 
is a long list of public DBOs that have experienced serious implementation problems, including Gambia ECOWAN, Senegal ADIE, Q.NBN in Qatar, and the Australian NBN. 
For the state management model to be a success on 
a national scale, an unusual amount of political cohe -
sion, intragovernment coordination and leveraging synergies may be required (for example, other public utilities to support the creation of the new utility) to facilitate and lower the cost of deployment, such as in the case of Oman Broadband Company. In Lithuania, the RAIN project benefited from a high level of technical competence within the sector ministry, an attribute that is not found in many governments in those developing nations with scarce human capital of this nature. Oman and Lithuania may indeed be “the exceptions that prove the rule” in favor of private sector management for infrastructure deployment in developing countries.
Where public participation is required in the manage -
ment of deployment and operation of infrastructure, 
initiatives have benefited from the expertise and resources of the private sector through leasing, concessions, or a PPP SPV arrangement. A summary of lessons learned on management options is shown in table 3.4.

3.5. Revenue Generation
Sources of Revenue
The approach to revenue generation forms a fourth 
element to the business model. If the market is buoy -
ant enough, standard service pricing on a capacity or usage basis may be adequate to achieve business case objectives. However, telecommunications service pricing has long exhibited schemes designed to attract low-usage or high-cost consumers “on-net.” Two-part tariffing (subsidized access pricing, combined with profit-making usage) is a traditional market solution to the problem. Regulation in the sector as well has often required price averaging. 
For larger scale infrastructure deployments or where 
service takeup might be protracted, further revenue innovation may be required. Down payments are a standard feature of subsea cables, for example. Where government services will be provided, govern-ment volume commitments or down payments may be another solution or part of a menu of the solutions.
At some point, however, higher cost and/or less-af -
fluent demand render internal revenue solutions 
inadequate. Revenue subsidies are a typical response in these cases. Revenue subsidies can simply be recurring grants or payment waivers (for example, tax holidays) provided to the service provider or can be directed at stimulating demand through vouchers to consumers.
Finally, in some community contexts in developing 
markets, there are less-traditional approaches:
 •Service providers require minimum purchase of specific content;
 •Two-sided market solutions in which, for example, the end-user is subjected to advertising while using the service, thus advertising assists in the funding of the infrastructure rollout; or  •private actors, pursuing a “double-bottom line,” effectively subsidize operations without the in -
tention of recouping losses in service profitability (even in the long run). Instead, they expect value being created in brand or unrelated markets. 
Lessons Learned
Virtually all infrastructure deployments have a traditional “pipe and usage” offering as a major component of their revenues. Down payments provide initial cash flow and reduce startup risk for major infrastructure projects. Advance government payments have proved key to a number of national backbone projects, but their significance is limited to the degree that government will utilize the network. 
Service provider subsidies are best implemented in 
the context of a tender to select the least-cost provid-er. Subsidies should be limited in nature or can lead to inefficiencies associated with soft-budget constraints. 
Economists have argued that subsidies are better 
provided to the end-user to allow demand to drive the allocation of resources. Consumer subsidies are also more appropriate in competitive environments where there is the opportunity to select among service providers.
Finally, with regard to community networks involving 
low deployment cost, a wide range of revenue possi -
bilities open up. This in turn leads to more opportu -
nities to supply needed infrastructure to low-income locations.62

4.1. Subsea Crossborder Projects
Submarine projects can be 
thought of as a substitute for terrestrial connections made attractive by lower cost of cover -
ing very long distances. Consider, by way of example, the recently launched SEA-ME-WE-5 project shown in figure 4.2.
A terrestrial equivalent linking 
Melaka, Malaysia, to Toulon, France, would have to cross over 20 countries, confronting high civil works’ costs and diverse local mar -
ket constraints in each jurisdiction. By contrast, a submarine con -Figure 4.2: SEA-ME-WE 5 Route

nection can stretch from Malaysia to France almost exclusively in international waters (with the Egypt crossing the only exception). As a result, terrestrial cable laying proves substantially more expensive than the subsea equivalent to provide similar capacity. 
Once the route is defined, the initiator(s) will gener -
ally endeavor to enroll representatives of countries 
along the way, with several objectives in mind:
 •maximizing the number of landing points and, 
therefore, increasing business opportunities;
 •creating redundancies on multiple routes;
 •reducing the cost of ownership; and
 •facilitating crossing of unavoidable territorial waters.
Except for a small number of private “narrow” owner -
ship projects, for example, MainOne, submarine ca -
bles are usually financed, rolled out, and managed by 
large consortia. Historically, this type of arrangement has been established to help incumbent national telecommunications networks contribute to a shared platform to provide lower-cost, higher-quality interna -tional voice and data communication services. More recently, new private operators and groups have also joined existing consortia, with a view to either acquir -
ing international broadband capacity for their own operations (for example, MTN in the West African Cable System, WACS), or to be able to offer competi -
tive wholesale solutions to others (for example, TTCL in the Eastern Africa Submarine System (EASSy) (see box 4.1). 
Capital costs in these ventures are entirely borne 
by the consortium members, in accordance with their ownership agreement, usually referred to as a Construction and Maintenance Agreement (C&MA). Each member is allocated a given unit of capacity, Minimum Investment Units (MIUs) or Minimum Assignable Unit (MAUs), according to their invest -
ment participation. 
In some cases, each consortium member is classified 
as Tier A, B, C, D, or E and given an agreed-upon dis -
count. Table 4.1 gives an example of how discounts can be structured, in order to incentivize a bigger group to maximize their contribution, and therefore their involvement.INNO VATIVE BUSINESS MODELS FOR EXPA NDING FIBER- OPTIC NETW ORKS AND CL OSING THE ACCESS GAPS65

Tier C 30 to 40 1.4 299
Tier D 15 to 30 1.7 363
Tier E < 15 2.0 428
As shown in table 4.1, the capacity unit cost for a 
Tier C member would be 1.4 times higher than what a Tier A member would pay. This principle can also encourage smaller parties to collaborate so as to present a single high tier member, therefore gaining access to cheaper capacity.

vestment, each operator contributes to the operating 
and maintenance (O&M) expenses at cost, according to its personal share of the cable.
Each operator can activate its allocated MIUs/MAUs 
upon request to the consortium central office. Doing so inevitably involves the use of some services provid-ed at landing stations, leading to additional rental charges, which are preagreed within the C&MA.
These landing stations are generally not included with-
in the total cable investment. Landing partners (typi-cally, but not always, consortium members) incur the cost of building and operating landing stations. These costs are then compensated by the consortium, either in one payment on the Ready-For-Service (RFS) date, or over the lifetime of the cable. In the latter case, each connected operator is charged with a monthly contri-bution towards the landing station it uses.
The consortium will generally create a specific inter -
nal committee or unit in charge of the finance side 
of the cable deployment and put in place a complex mechanism to ensure total investment recovery from the landing partners.Finally, a consortium rarely has a financing role to play, and the consortium itself generally cannot incur any debt. Thus, consortium members must seek financing separately if necessary. 
There are four primary channels of finance that are 
characteristic of subsea cable projects:
 •project financing provided by DFIs, government export credit agencies, or conventional banks;
 •vendor financing in the form of short-term favor -
able payment terms on long-term loans backed by the vendor’s financial institution;
 •documentary credits, which are debts provided by a bank or a financial institution for the sole pur -
pose of the acquisition of a specific good—with payments from the bank directly to the vendor; and
 •down payments from the pre-RFS and Indefeasible Rights of Use (IRU) sales which reduce the need for other financing. 
A counter-example to the typical consortium ap -
proach to subsea cable projects is MainOne, which provides connectivity between West Africa and Europe. MainOne began as a comparatively small operation providing connectivity for service providers in Ghana and Nigeria. It has compensated for this small scale by implementing a number of prudent business model attributes. For example, it has largely outsourced significant parts of its deployment to specialized partners and found preferential funding 66
Box 4.1: EASSy – Eastern Africa Crossborder Subsea Cablethrough the Pan-African Infrastructure Development 
Fund. Furthermore, it has gained scale through pur -
suing a different segment strategy: providing metro fiber in Nigeria and Ghana as well as datacenter, cloud, and managed-security services. 
A key contributor to the overall value of a subsea 
cable to national economies is how the cable landing bottleneck is implemented. There have been numer-ous cases where the achievement of the subsea cable deployment has not been fully realized because of the fact that the cable landing was monopolized by a verti-cally integrated national incumbent. One of the signifi-cant innovations that was implemented along the ACE cable (for example, in Liberia, São Tomé and Príncipe, The Gambia, and so on) is that SPVs were created with financial contributions from the private and public sectors with the mission of providing access to subsea cable capacity to all service providers on an open access basis. Public sector participation was often assisted by World Bank financing on favorable terms. These SPVs generally have little incentive to behave anticompetitively and have led to a fuller flow through of subsea cable benefits to domestic markets.
Similar to these SPV landing station initiatives are 
recent projects in the Pacific, such as in Tonga, where public-private arrangements are operating links to bigger subsea cable systems, for example, Southern Crossing. Again, these subsea cable companies provide domestic service providers open access to international networks at reasonable rates. DFI involvement has been critical for these projects given the high startup costs and uncertain demand. 
Conceived in 2003, the Eastern Africa Submarine System (EASSy), is a submarine cable system linking Sudan to South Africa, via Eastern African countries including: Sudan, Djibouti, Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, the Comoros, Mozambique, Madagascar, and South Africa.
From inception, EASSy was structured as a consortium of public and 
private operators, though mostly ruled by private institutions.
The supply contract, which represents the beginning of the two-year 
deployment, came into force in May 2008. The Ready-for-Service date was celebrated in September 2010.
During the following year, the consortium members agreed on two con-
secutive upgrades, raising the overall capacity of the cable to 4.7 Tbps.
Designed by Alcatel-Lucent, the system comprises two fiber pairs configured as a flat ring for higher resilience that run over 10,000 kilometers and land at nine different stations. Like most subsea cables, EASSy uses DWDM technology, transmitting SDH frames. The flat ring architecture, also referred to as a collapse ring, enables full protection of the system in case of rupture of one branch or any termination card or equipment at the landing station. 
EASSy’s consortium members are all operators of terrestrial cables, and/or members of other subsea INNO VATIVE BUSINESS MODELS FOR EXPA NDING FIBER- OPTIC NETW ORKS AND CL OSING THE ACCESS GAPS67

With no direct involvement of any governmental bodies, except for five incumbents, EASSy cannot be con-
sidered as a flagship PPP endeavor. However, WIOCC, the consortium member with the highest share of the project (28 percent)—well ahead of the second highest MTN with 15 percent—is itself comprised of 14 smaller telecommunications players (see figure 4.3). These include the Lesotho Communications Authority, which seeks to contribute to the development of its telecommunications sector in a country with one of the lowest broadband penetration rates worldwide. 
For more details, see appendix, page 136.

WIOCC’s initial mission was to open the most remote part of Africa to affordable communications. This 
is well summarized in WIOCC’s current vision: “To make an enduring contribution to Africa’s communica-tions.” It has indeed itself invested or indirectly led to further investments in adjacent markets in the region.
One of the key success factors behind EASSy was the scarcity of alternate solutions for international 
connectivity from Eastern African countries, as well as the growing rate of many of these economies. For most of the member countries, accessing European traffic meant being routed to other countries via terrestrial cable, transiting to India via SAFE or IOX and eventually completing the journey on one of the numerous subsea cables linking India to Europe. EASSy generated an immense opportunity for affordable and reliable international connectivity to the western world, essential to the growth of these countries.
Challenges to the immediate success of the project did arise. EASSy suffered from setup issues typical in 
a large consortium. Addressing the concerns of each consortium member was difficult both because of differences in each member’s objectives and because the members were also partners, client-providers, and competitors outside of the cable project. Such a complex set of relationships can make it challeng -
ing to reach agreed resolutions.68
4.2. T errestrial Crossborder Projects
While submarine projects are intended to resolve 
long-distance crossborder cost issues through cheap-er rollout, terrestrial crossborder projects tend to fol-low a different conceptual path. These projects often appear as a series of bilateral interconnection en-deavors. In particular, initiatives have been based on:
1. the organic growth of one small player extending 
internationally (for example, Liquid Telecom, Interoute, and Ufinet); 
2. the interconnection of various independent networks across multiple countries (for example, Baltic Optical Network, JADI, RCN, crossborder WIOCC); or
3. the product of large development funds projects with regional reach (for example, Central Africa Backbone).
In the case of a small player extension, the private operator may start either from a national network initiative (for example, Liquid Telecom in Africa) or a crossborder intention from inception (for example, Interoute in Europe). Liquid Telecom, started in Zimbabwe, and remained a national network for its first 10 years. Once it had reached a certain level of maturity and financial stability, Liquid (called Econet at the time) searched for growth in neighboring countries and initiated international expansion through acquisition with the goal of increasing value, capitalizing on growing foundation and experience, and reaching out to new territories (see box 4.2). Interoute’s early history was challenging, having been born as market liberaliza -
tion was sweeping across Europe. It fell victim to the burst of the telecommunications bubble and capacity overbuild in the early 2000s, but kept its ambition to link all the major business centers in Europe with a carrier-neutral crossborder wholesale and enterprise play. This type of international growth generally materializes through acquisition of operators in other countries, or through a series of greenfield license acquisitions. Consequently, these types of large crossborder terrestrial operators tend to be char -
acterized by sophisticated financial strategies and tax-optimized structures.

INNO VATIVE BUSINESS MODELS FOR EXPA NDING FIBER- OPTIC NETW ORKS AND CL OSING THE ACCESS GAPS69
Ufinet followed a similar expansion as Liquid Telecom 
and Interoute but has been based primarily around telecommunications assets associated with gas and power utilities. Ufinet was born of the commercializa -
tion of telecommunications assets of Spanish natural gas utility Union Fensosa. It then expanded into central America through acquisition and new fiber investments. The company has positioned itself as a carrier neutral core and crossborder network service provider and successfully benefited from market liberalization. 
Large crossborder networks can often be formed by 
connecting various existing national networks. Two initiatives in the Middle East—the Jeddah-Amman-Damascus-Istanbul (JADI) cable and the Regional Cable Network (linking UAE, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan and Turkey)—were born of efforts to reduce existing crossborder bottlenecks in the region. The Baltic Fiber Network is the linkage of the telecom -
munications networks of power utilities in the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. The network is an alliance rather than a commercial entity. They have found a market opportunity to offer services to customers across borders to better com -
pete against traditional telecommunications players. 
WIOCC represents a clear example of finding regional 
synergy and scale through consortium. As mentioned above, these 14 small operators, private and public, created a consortium capable of taking the bigger shares of EASSy, WACS, and Europe India Gateway (EIG). Their cooperation lead to terrestrial expansion, and WIOCC now runs a core network running from South Africa to Kenya.The third type of crossborder terrestrial network tends to be initiated and financed by DFIs. Generally, these types of cable projects have particularly unat -
tractive economics and are feasible only through DFI initiative. This type of project naturally bears a high financing risk and has little attractiveness to typical investors. As such, these projects must be seen in the context of an attempt to capture broader economic benefit rather than as market-based endeavors.The Central Africa Backbone represents an example of this type of venture, where the World Bank has attempted to bring fiber connection to the poorest countries in the world. The backbone runs from Chad to the Democratic Republic of Congo and, once final -
ized in 2019, will have taken more than 10 years to complete, mainly because of financing complications.
Large development fund projects tend to be built 
entirely from scratch. Association with an equipment manufacturer is not uncommon, as it serves the role of a flagship project for the vendor, while enabling attractive vendor financing, therefore reducing the risk taken on by the initiating DFI.
Table 4.2 summarizes the high-level attributes of 
the business models of these crossborder initiatives. Although there is variation as discussed above, there is a great deal of uniformity among the business models at this top point of the infrastructure value chain. As we descend to the last mile, the challenges become more difficult and the business models become more diverse and innovative.70

Box 4.2: Liquid Telecom: African Crossborder Terrestrial Cable
Created in 1997 and initially known as Econet 
Satellite (Zimbabwe), the company became Liquid Telecom in 2004, establishing its first large crossborder African terrestrial network in 2009. Privately financed in its entirety, Liquid Telecom has rapidly become an essential broadband infrastructure provider in eastern, central and southern Africa.
With over 50,000 kilometers of fiber across 15 
countries, Liquid is the first regional fiber ring of the continent.
Liquid Telecom has increased its footprint by combination of network expansions and large acquisition, mainly financed through debt raised at group level. 
Liquid extended most of its reach through acquisition (Zimbabwe, Kenya (KDN), Zambia, Rwanda 
(Rwandatel), Uganda, and so on) but also creates joint ventures with utility companies, especially those reaching the lucrative mining industry (the Copperbelt Energy Corporation in Zambia, the Botswana Power Company, the Kenya Electricity Transmission Company, and Société Nationale d’Électricité (SNEL) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo). However, once in a country, Liquid works to improve networks with a fair share of deployment. 
Finally, with a large variety of such partnerships, Liquid Telecom’s strategy also led to diversifying its port -
folio of services. The company now offers not only broadband connectivity, but also products as varied 
as IP transit, EPL, datacenters, leased lines, VSAT broadband, enterprise IP VPN, ethernet VPN, hosting, and even some retail services. Originally more or less a carrier neutral wholesale play, this diversification enables a comprehensive product offering, but may raise questions about its ability to provide nondis -
criminatory wholesale services in the future.

4.3. National Backbone Network Projects
A national backbone is the collection of high-capacity 
links and nodes connecting dispersed regional and local networks throughout a country. These links function to aggregate and route traffic among regional and local networks as well as to and from international markets. 
Given adequate volume levels and competition, there 
may be more than one backbone network extending to large and small cities. In these markets, the vol -
umes of traffic are adequately high to justify parallel and extensive backbone investments and competing operators with access networks will generally have their own core or backbone network. 
In less developed countries, it is common to find only 
one national backbone, often with limited reach. Just as investing in access networks gives rise to additional backbone capacity requirements, building backbone facilities can promote the deployment of access networks. In the past two decades, policy mak -
ers in developing countries have often facilitated the construction of national backbone networks to relieve access network providers of the additional cost associated with linking diverse local networks. This additional cost may take the form of: a) having to pay an incumbent for existing backbone facilities at prices that may not be cost based; or b) building one’s own facilities to carry what may be a small share of total national backbone traffic.
This chapter examines the business models that 
have been used to deploy such backbones in cases in which the dominant provider has not provided reasonable terms for access or in which adequate infrastructure is simply absent. 
In terms of technology, although alternatives to fiber 
optics exist—in particular microwave and satellite—these have not proved realistic for broadband trans -
mission. Traditional satellite transmission is slow and can be vulnerable to climatological conditions. New satellite technologies in the context of the last mile are examined in chapter 5. Microwave, while often having a role to play in thin routes, is generally not appropriate for high-speed backbone requirements.
As one moves down the infrastructure supply chain 
from crossborder connectivity to national backbones, the economics of network deployment can become more problematic. In the developing world, there are likely to be regions that do not generate the volumes of traffic, even if aggregated, to convince private actors to invest. It is therefore not surprising that a wider range of business models are beginning to emerge in this space as actors seek more creative means to make an investment case (see figure 4.5).
In Botswana, the effort to expand and upgrade the 
national backbone network began with a restruc -
turing of the incumbent state-owned company, Botswana Telecommunications Corporation (BTC), in advance of its privatization. In doing so, the gov -
ernment had two objectives: 1) retaining what was perceived as a national strategic asset in state hands; and 2) reducing the market power of the incumbent associated with its vertical monopoly in the sector. Thus, the international connectivity capacity in EASSy and the WACS subsea cables and national back -
bone assets of BTC were transferred to BoFiNet in advance of the former going public. Its creation was a compromise between the desire to privatize the incumbent (BTC) and the government’s wish to keep certain strategic assets under state control. BoFiNet operates on an open-access basis. 
Gabon chose a different route: finding an interna -
tional firm to build and operate the Gabon National 
Fiber Optic Network. The government spent some $60 million to construct the network, with the assets fully in state ownership. The state hired the French firm, Axione, as the management partner. INNO VATIVE BUSINESS MODELS FOR EXPA NDING FIBER- OPTIC NETW ORKS AND CL OSING THE ACCESS GAPS73

Significantly, this is not a long-term concession, but 
rather a medium term operating contract of seven years. Support is ongoing, and the government of Gabon continues its involvement in the financing by covering CAPEX, while the network operator covers only OPEX. As of 2017, the operation of the landing station is successful, but the backbone linking over 20 cities and villages is still in test phase. Services offered will include backbone transport, dark fiber leases, colocation, and transit services to mobile operators and Internet service providers (ISPs), provided on an open-access basis. 
Yet another successful PPP approach found in Africa 
is SimbaNET in Malawi. Advised by the World Bank Group, the government of Malawi  ran a competitive 
tender for a 10-year contract to design, build, and op -
erate a national backbone. SimbaNET deployed 900 kilometers of fiber and a “virtual landing station” with -
in the landlocked nation. This virtual landing station includes the meet-me and network operations center (NOC) facilities one would expect at a subsea cable landing station but is located in Malawi. SimbaNET contracts for connectivity to the actual cable landing stations for the TEAMS, EASSy, SEACOM, and WACS subsea cables via Tanzania and Zambia. To improve the business case, the government offers an offtake arrangement guaranteeing a critical level of sales to the new entity. SimbaNET is required to offer services on an open-access basis. 
The Lithuania RAIN initiative is similar to BoFiNet in 
the sense that the state has retained both ownership and management of the company. The Ministry of Transport and Communications exercises the state’s ownership function. A state company “Placiajuostis internetas” manages the network. It does, however, outsource the operational maintenance of the net-work to private contractors. Also, similar to the other national backbones discussed above, RAIN facilities and services are provided on a nondiscriminatory basis. There is also a subsidy involved that arises from the fact that prices are set at a level that en-sures that retail broadband services in the targeted 
Source: TMG/Salience Consulting.74
areas can be provided at a price similar to retail levels 
in urban areas. State assistance comes in the form of European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) funding and the Lithuanian national budget. 
Another notable case is that of Madagascar. The 
national fixed line incumbent, Telma, was privatized 
in 2004 through acquisition by a local, horizontally diversified company, Axian. Axian has interests in the financial services, real-estate and energy sectors as well as telecommunications. In the past few years, Axian has built out 8,800 kilometers of fiber-optic cables nationwide in addition to rolling out fiber and mobile access networks as well as operations in Reunion-Mayotte and Comoros. In addition to Telma, Axian operates TowerCo of Madagascar (ToM). Axian’s Telma and ToM are two of four recipients of subsidies to buildout 65 telecommunication towers in remote areas, a deployment that promises to provide service to more than two million new subscribers. With this subsidy, Telma, ToM, Camusat, and Orange, are responsible for building, owning, and operating shareable infrastructure under open-access condi -
tions, with nondiscriminatory and low-cost pricing. 
An interesting case from the United States is 
Southern Telecom. Southern Telecom is a vertically 
integrated (generation, transmission, and distri -
bution) power company operating in Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. The company took advantage of new rights given to utilities under the 1996 Telecommunications Act to provide capacity to multiple public telecommunications service provid -
ers. In addition to expanding its wholesale network, Southern Telecom has expanded into private mobile network service provision for public and private sector clients requiring coverage to remote locations in the southeastern states.
Finally, it is worth mentioning the Philippines . The 
Philippines is one of the few developing countries in 
the world with competing national fiber-backbone infrastructure: PLDT’s Domestic Fiber Optic Network (DFON) and Globe Telecom’s Fiber Optic Backbone Network (FOBN) and the National Grid Corporation of the Philippine’s (NGCP) national private telecom -
munication network. The government’s priority is therefore focused at the middle- and last-mile level. 
However, it is considering how to best facilitate these 
backbone networks to support programs to rollout middle- and last-mile networks in unserved and underserved areas. This includes: 1) identifying areas yet to be served by the domestic backbone routes but that will eventually serve as the primary nodes for reaching underserved areas; and 2) linking the national backbones to avoid the need to duplicate network rollout to these challenging areas.However, alongside these positive stories of success, innovation, and prudent choices for public inter -
vention, there are cautionary examples where the benefits of the project were not fully realized. 
In The Gambia, for example, the fully state-owned 
fixed-line incumbent, Gamtel, constructed a national backbone comprised of 817 kilometers of fiber-optic links. The network was financed by a loan from the Islamic Development Bank and was intended to be a low-cost open-access network available to all service providers. After completion of the network construction, the operation of the network remained in Gamtel’s hands. Beyond its deteriorating financial health, Gamtel has found it organizationally chal -
lenging to fulfil the sector leadership tasks assigned to it by the government, among which are providing low-cost, reliable, and nondiscriminatory backbone transmission services. Owing to high prices and low service quality, some operators are continuing to rely on, or even moving back to usage of their microwave networks instead of the ECOWAN. The ECOWAN, which should bring the capacity from ACE submarine landing station across the country, is therefore highly underutilized.
A similar story can be found in Senegal, where the 
government launched a vendor-financed national fiber-optic project to connect government buildings, ministries, and facilities. The network had aspirations to be an open-access backbone service as well, but it is operated and maintained by the government’s own INNO VATIVE BUSINESS MODELS FOR EXPA NDING FIBER- OPTIC NETW ORKS AND CL OSING THE ACCESS GAPS75
ICT agency, which is arguably inadequately resourced 
to fulfill that mission. The network has been poorly maintained, underutilized, and required excessive subsidy to keep afloat. The government is now seeking ways to introduce private sector expertise and possi-ble private sector investment to transform the network into a financially sustainable, open-access initiative.
Burundi , a landlocked neighbor, followed a different 
path. Faced with similar challenges, in what has 
been termed a “cooperative” model, a consortium of Burundian telecommunications operators was creat -
ed with assistance from the Burundian government and World Bank. The resulting Burundi Broadband System (BBS) involved the creation of a 1,250-kilome -
ter fiber-optic backbone connecting all 17 provinces. Network connection points at the borders with Rwanda and Tanzania provide the landlocked country with access to the landing points of international sub -
marine cables in Mombasa and Dar es Salaam. Like BoFiNet, BBS was an open access wholesale service provider. The Burundi government does not hold an ownership stake in BBS directly, but a major share -
holder, Onatel, is a state-owned enterprise (SOE). The state also supported the project financially through a prepaid subsidy. The subsidy was significant, totaling somewhat more that the total equity contributed by the consortium members. Ultimately, BBS’s financial basis proved too weak. Some of the private operators failed to contribute the funds they had promised and others, like Africell, effectively exited the market. Onatel faced bankruptcy following a failed privat -
ization process. It also faces severe competitive pressure with the market entry of Lumitel in 2014. In January 2017, the government revoked BBS’s PPP status and took it into government ownership.
A large part of the problem with these projects could 
be ascribed to limited participation of the private sec -
tor, financial frailty, and soft budget constraints, but there are also cases where lack of a robust business case has also lead to poor performance. In 2014, the government of Peru issued a number of conces -
sions to design, build, and operate a north-to-south national backbone (RNDFO). As with most of the other projects, the backbone was to offer wholesale open-access services to mobile operators and ISPs. However, at the same time, the mobile operators were building out their own networks, as might be expected in a vibrant Latin American market such as Peru. As a result, prices for network services crashed and the network became highly underutilized. 
The Rwandan government was one of the first 
African nations to confront its backbone issue with direct intervention. As part of its National Information Communication Infrastructure plan for 2005-10, it set out to deploy a high-capacity national fiber-optic back-bone throughout the country. It did so by contracting Korea Telecom to supply a network comprising 2,300 kilometers of fiber to link 317 institutions (97 in Kigali and 220 outside the capital) across all 30 districts of the country, as well as connecting at all nine of Rwanda’s borders. Most of the network is under-ground, but Rwanda NBFON has relied on the power utility infrastructure for laying above-ground fiber. 
The Rwandan government originally contracted 
Broadband Systems Corporation to manage the backbone, but it has since transferred operations to Olleh Rwanda Networks (ORN), which is majority owned (51 percent) by Korea Telecom, with the Government of Rwanda holding a 49 percent stake. The company has been renamed KT Rwanda Networks. The construction of the fiber-optic network was completed in 2011 with a capacity of 10 Gbps and is meant to sell dark and active fiber on an open-access basis. KT Rwanda Networks was also granted a monopoly on 4G LTE wholesale in the country and has been increasing its presence in retail markets. Not surprisingly there have been complaints that such a 4G monopoly is incompatible with intend -
ed models of a carrier neutral entity. Indeed, local Rwandan mobile operators are favoring the upgrade of their own networks rather than using KT’s monop -
oly 4G network.
A final cautionary tale comes from South Africa, 
which has numerous public and private sector backbones. There are two primary public-sector 76
backbones used primarily for public telecommunica-
tions: one belonging to the incumbent, Telkom SA, the other, Broadband InfraCo, owned and operated by the national power utility and the national rail oper-ator. There are several private backbones of various sizes. Of interest here is Broadband InfraCo, which ostensibly enjoyed the advantages of an existing infrastructure base before commercializing the tele-communications assets in 2009. However, because of politicization that often comes with state ownership, the company was first obligated to sell its capacity to Neotel to fulfill government aspirations for the second national fixed line operator. It has since had numer-ous troubles delivering under competitive conditions in South Africa (Macmillan Keck and the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment 2017, 173-79).

5.1. Fixed Access Networks
Fixed Broadband Access 
T echnologies
Serving rural areas with broadband technology 
has always been a challenge, especially in the early phases of broadband deployment where costs are a major concern. In general, rural areas have a more scattered distribution of housing that increases the costs of deployment on a per home passed basis. 
The two main cost drivers for fixed broadband access 
deployment are: average house frontage (the front -
age distance on or from the main road) and takeup.
23 
Typically, in a rural area the frontage is much bigger than in an urban area, and takeup may be lower because of less affluent demand – significantly increasing unit costs. This applies to all fixed wired technologies, such as fiber, coaxial or even copper, although copper may have the advantage if it has already been installed for public switched telephone network (PSTN) services. 
However, fiber-to-the-premises is still considered 
the “future-proof” solution in terms of bandwidth, and with an ultimate capacity of petabits per second (Pbit/s), it arguably will not be superseded by any other known technologies, including 5G. 
Rural FTTH 
Greenfield fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) deployment in rural areas has not been common until now because of these cost considerations. As mentioned above, frontage distances are higher in rural areas, which results in higher costs on a per home basis, both for trenching and cable. Of course, in rural areas it is generally more acceptable to deploy fiber on 
23 The degree to which infrastructure can be shared at the access level may be another cost driver. In addition to lower cost, infrastructure sharing 
reduces some competition risk, which is generally beneficial to a service provider’s business case.poles, as overhead cable, rather than to require 
underground fiber installation, and this can signifi -
cantly reduce costs, especially if poles can be shared with other utilities, such as electricity providers. Furthermore, it is important to note that settlement densities can vary widely, and many rural villages can have a fairly dense cluster of housing, with small frontages. In these cases, the costs for access may be comparable to urban areas. Of course, last-mile fiber may only be suitable where middle-mile access is also brought through fiber (or through another technol -
ogy that can provide comparable performance), so it may be the high middle-mile and backbone costs that would represent the bigger obstacle. 
Rural Coaxial/DOCSIS
Coaxial cable, using Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) standards, is frequently used by cable operators to deploy cable television and broadband services. It is generally installed as a tree and branch network, with fiber taken to the last amplifier, feeding the coaxial cable. In general, if used in rural areas in a greenfield scenario, its costs will be similar to the FTTH case. In some cases, coaxial cable can have some cost advantage over FTTH. For example, coaxial cable is arguably better suited to distribution on poles.
However, although coaxial cable can be used to 
deliver bandwidths of greater than 1 Gbit/s, higher frequencies exhibit higher loss, and the technology starts to approach its fundamental limits. It is not as robust as FTTH. The only case where coaxial deployment is economically justified would be in an existing network requiring upgrade to provide better performance—in this case upgrade cost will be lower than new fiber build.INNO VATIVE BUSINESS MODELS FOR EXPA NDING FIBER- OPTIC NETW ORKS AND CL OSING THE ACCESS GAPS79
VDSL/FTTC
Very high speed digital subscriber line (VDSL) is the 
preferred technology for incumbent operators that have already deployed copper cable extensively for PSTN services. VDSL line cards are installed in exist -
ing street cabinets, connected to the copper pairs in the distribution cable, and fiber is taken to the street cabinet (fiber-to-the-cabinet (FTTC)), serving the VDSL line cards.
For greenfield situations, with new copper, cabinets 
and fiber, the costs would be higher than FTTH, and therefore the greenfield VDSL is rarely an option. VDSL really comes into its own in brownfield situa -
tions, where copper is already present and the local loops are relative short (as VDSL performance is best below 1 km).
24 The copper pair is reused in the distri -
bution network, and overall costs are much lower. A further point is that the systems can be rolled out in a much shorter timescale since much of the work has already been done. 
Bandwidths available from VDSL typically are about 
40 Mbit/s, but lately the technology has been im -
proving. For example, technologies such as G.fast allow higher bandwidth, but at the expense of shorter usable distances, perhaps just a few hundred meters. This means that costs escalate significantly, since fiber is taken further into the network, such as perhaps the distribution point.
VDSL has also been used in rural areas, although 
often supported with government subsidization. For example, the Broadband Delivery UK (BDUK) initiative was focused on broadband in rural areas, and most contracts were awarded for VDSL deployment.
24 In case of longer distances where equipment needs to move from central offices to new build street furniture (roadside boxes) the costs might be 
prohibitive.VDSL in rural areas is a useful alternative, and a 
significant improvement on available services in rural areas, but it is still a temporary situation pending a full FTTH deployment, and even under those circum -
stances, it will face stiff competition from 5G services.
Fixed Broadband Access 
Business Models
Twelve fixed broadband networks were examined as 
part of this study (see table 5.1).
These cases show a consistent story of the private 
sector outperforming state ownership and man -
agement models. The Australia NBN, Burlington Telecom, iProvo, and Q.NBN are all cautionary tales for state management of broadband infrastructure management. Oman Broadband Company (OBC) (see box 5.3) is exceptional to date, but it has benefited from consensus on its role in the market. Under truly competitive conditions, it is quite possible that OBC would not have survived. 
In the case of Burlington Telecom and iProvo, sus -
tainability was achieved through privatization of state 
assets. LeverettNet and France Limousin demon -
strate that state ownership can benefit from proper concessioning and outsourcing of operations. 
Singapore’s National Broadband Network (NBN) is 
an example of a privately run network subsidized by government (see box 5.1).
Rural network examples (France Limousin, Poland’s 
Rural networks, Germany’s Länder program and RUNE) have generally required subsidy to close financing gaps (see box 5.2). RUNE seeks to be an exception to this by, among other things, targeting more densely populated villages.80

Box 5.1: OpenNet/NetLink Trust Singapore: Privately Run Network Utility Subsidized by Government
Singapore’s National Broadband Network (NBN) 
was a pioneering initiative, as it was one of the first networks to involve mandated complete separation of the infrastructure assets belonging to the incumbent operator 
In 2005, Singapore published its 10-year ICT plan 
under Intelligent Nation 2015 (IN2015) which, among other things, called for the establishment of a single national fiber infrastructure. Among the first implementation tasks given to the regulator was conducting an open selection of 
the NetCo license for passive infrastructure and OpCo license for active infrastructure operation under a three-tier framework that included retail service providers (RSPs) as a top layer providing much of the service innovation. Initially, the award of the licenses was to be completed within a 1.5-year period; however, various political and consortium issues resulted in the process taking twice as long. 
Eventually a handful of bidders reached the final round with OpenNet, a Singtel-led consortium, winning 
the NetCo license in September 2008 and Nucleus Connect, the StartHub-led consortium, winning the OpCo license. The OpenNet consortium consisted of Axia NetMedia (30 percent), Singapore Telecommunications/SingTel (30 percent), Singapore Press Holdings (25 percent) and Singapore Power Telemedia (15 percent). The OpenNet consortium received $500 million as a government grant as part of the process, and the OpCo license holder also received a $170 million government grant. 
Implementation of the new regime was not without its challenges. Numerous operators have complained 
about the inadequate space provisions in the exchanges and the preference given to the incumbent, Singtel. Throughout the years, the telecommunications regulator has also had to penalize OpenNet re-peatedly for failings in fulfilling its service obligations especially in respect to time to connect to customers. 
In 2011 NetLink Trust was established and the passive nonfiber infrastructure assets that were required 
as part of the rollout of next generation fiber network, comprising underground ducts, manholes and central offices, were transferred to NetLink Trust from Singtel. NetLink then acquired OpenNet in 2013 as part of a consolidation process to acquire the fiber network – effectively Singtel buying out its four partners for a combined amount of $95 million. The International Development Association (IDA) approved the transaction with certain caveats relating to the monitoring of the operations, the role of Singtel as main subcontractor and mandating SingTel to divest the majority of its ownership in NetLink by 2018. In line with the agreement, Singtel sold 75 percent of its shares through an initial public offer -
ing (IPO) in July 2017 with a value of $1.7 billion, thus completing its divestment move.
In 2013 Netlink reached full nationwide fiber coverage in terms of residential homes and nonresidential 
premises passed. As of 30 September 2017, the company reported 1.5 million homes passed and 1.1 million homes connected across Singapore, confirming the strong business case fundamentals of the NetCo business.

Box 5.2: PPP Limousin France: Regional Concession to Create and Operate Rural Broadband Network 
The Limousin is a rural region of France, where 
the search for adequate broadband connectivity began as early as 1996. Not content with the options available from the incumbent or new entrants, regional authorities ultimately formed a public consortium called DORSAL to secure the appropriate financing, defining the scale and scope of the deployment and overall project management for their own broadband network. 
In a first phase, after securing €204 million in financing, a 24-year concession was awarded by competi -
tive tender to a local ICT company called Axione Limousin in 2005. Through this concession, Axione was mandated to design, build, and operate a broadband core and middle-mile wholesale network, available to all French service providers on a nondiscriminatory basis. This deployment was referred to as the first-generation network.
In parallel, another consortium, SPL Aquitaine, was created and given the mandate to design and build 
public fiber access networks, which were then transferred through concession to Axione to commercial -
ize and operate. This was then referred to as the second-generation network. One key success factor of the project was the harmonization between the first and second-generation networks.
The region has also encouraged private investment and allows service providers to deploy their own 
infrastructure in the most populated areas of the region.

Box 5.3: Oman Broadband: Public NBN Utility Incubated from Utility Assets 
In the early stages, the Omani government saw 
the opportunity of utilizing existing utility works to deploy an access fiber network. That is why, in 2008, when the wastewater utility, Haya Water, was given the mandate to deploy a sewage pipes network in the city of Muscat, the operation was extended to the deployment of an additional FTTH access network alongside. 
In 2013 Oman Broadband (OB) was created as a nationwide utility with the objective to fulfill the govern -
ment mandate of efficiently deploying a national broadband network. As part of this mandate, OB took over Haya Water’s telecommunications operations.
The formation of Oman Broadband was a key part of the national broadband strategy, which aimed to 
overcome the comparatively low levels of fixed broadband penetration within Oman, limited competition between the operators, and the high cost of expanding broadband services to rural areas.
After its formation, Oman Broadband expanded its infrastructure sharing with other utilities, such as 
water and power companies, for access network installation and sharing the already existing long-haul routes for supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) applications and the other ministries’ na -
tional private networks. The initiative harmonizes infrastructure rollout and allows a national backbone network to be provided quickly and relatively cheaply.
Since the network is offered on an equal access basis to different service providers, with little existing 
competition for infrastructure, the takeup rate for service is high, making the business case more attractive. At the end of 2017, the company had installed fiber infrastructure passing more than 200,000 homes, predominantly in Muscat, and has some 40,000 connected end-users.

5.2. Wireless Access Networks
Wireless Broadband Access 
T echnologies
As discussed in chapter 2.1, the advances of mo -
bile broadband technology from 3G to 4G and 5G 
have allowed mobile technology to meet most of the current demand requirements for broadband access. In some countries, these technologies have gained majority market share from the copper-based incumbent (and reluctance to invest in fiber by the incumbent certainly contributed to the case). The continued investment by MNOs in expanding and upgrading their mobile broadband networks will further contribute toward increasing connectivity in rural areas.
However, in certain low ARPU countries mobile 
connectivity will not be able to expand beyond the main cities unless more innovative technologies and business models are applied. 
With fixed wireless, by definition, there is a fixed 
antenna that is part of the solution, which increases capacity potential. These technologies have been rec -
ognized as a key component of national broadband plans for reaching rural areas. 
A number of initiatives have recently emerged that 
use separate dedicated LTE spectrum and existing mobile masts to provide fixed wireless to rural areas. These initiatives (even those limited in scope) have been largely successful in delivering performance in line with copper networks (for example, ADSL/VDSL) with fixed antennas set up at the premises they served. In the United States, these types of initiatives are now supported by the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) Connecting America Fund (CAF II). Beyond the last mile, in Romania, for example, LTE backhaul has been recognized as an adequate middle-mile solution.

Wi-Fi for Innovative Business 
Models
Wi-Fi is an established, relatively low-cost wireless 
technology. Owing to the relatively low equipment cost, the availability of spectrum, and the large number of Wi-Fi-enabled devices, various innovative business models have been launched and some are beginning to prove themselves viable. 
Subsidized free services.  This model relies on the 
local authority paying for the build and operation 
of the Wi-Fi hotspot network. The network pays for itself through the increased tax revenues generated through the economic benefits of having connectivity within the local authority. Isizwe bringing free Wi-Fi connectivity to communities in South Africa is an example of this approach (see box 5.5).Action-based payment models.  These models 
have customers undertaking certain actions in order to receive blocks of connectivity time or capacity. Current proposed actions include recycling certain amounts of plastic (it is proposed that for every kilogram of plastic recycled 100 megabytes of data connectivity will be given) or undertaking and passing particular microtraining courses. These options are designed to allow users nonfinancial methods to pay for connectivity, and as Wi-Fi costs have fallen it is possible to exchange these services for a meaningful amount of connectivity. This creates options where public or aid spending can be effectively used to drive outcomes through the use of connectivity as a reward. These action-based payment models are relatively new and currently unproven although they do represent significant potential. Again, see box 5.5 for more details).
Source: TMG/Salience Consulting.86
Build your own network models.  These models 
allow communities with little or no coverage to build 
a local area network to cover their community at little cost and with limited experience required. They are designed to provide much lower ongoing telecom -
munications costs to locals as they will be able to make on-net calls in their local area for free. 
Village Telco (see box 5.17) is an example of this 
approach. To date, the success of these models has been limited because of the need for more data ca -
pacity and the associated backhaul constraints. Once the backhaul issues are remedied, great potential exists for individual communities to build local net -
works. Rhizomatica is another example of an initiative enabling community-owned wireless networks for unserved areas.
Very low cost incremental pricing models.  Once 
backhaul connectivity is in place, an opportunity 
emerges to provide users with very low-cost, time-based packages for Internet connectivity. Poa! Networks of Kenya has pioneered this service, which offers users the ability to buy access for one hour for as little as K Sh 10 (about $0.10) and allows payment through the use of a mobile phone.
25 This model has 
proven a success in driving additional connectivity.
Other notable Wi-Fi cases are:
 •AirJaldi, using off-the shelf Wi-Fi equipment to 
supply service in rural India. AirJaldi has nine networks in five Indian states covering 24,200 square kilometers, with over 100,000 users; and
 •VAST Networks, which offers carrier grade, open-access Wi-Fi network infrastructure.
25 https://poa.co.ke/.Despite the various success cases across the world, there are number of reasons why Wi-Fi has not been as widespread or it failed, the reasons combine commercial, conceptual, and technical issues as listed below:
 •WI-FI is not really last mile —it is the last couple 
of hundred feet and is dependent on a fine bal -
ance of the right topology and density for takeup 
to provide a decent service. 
 •Very dependent on backhaul  from operators, 
which is often not available. 
 •Sensitive to improvements in cellular —solid 3G 
or 4G connectivity can often be as fast as Wi-Fi if backhaul is poor.
 •Not faster than fiber and less coverage than mobile.  Often it is not fast enough to be 
a fixed broadband replacement and does not have enough coverage to serve as a mobile replacement.
 •There is a misperception that it can be in -
stalled easily.  Wi-Fi can easily be installed in a 
house, but metro deployments require proper RF planning in order to provide a quality service. 
 •Customers think Wi-Fi is free.
 •Systems issues —Billing systems and portals have 
been clunky and payment methods difficult.
 •Large operators will not support Wi-Fi deploy -
ments. Some operators actively disrupt Wi-Fi deployments because of the risk of cannibalization of cellular revenue.
 •Coverage needs to be accompanied by other initiatives  which are often overlooked, such as 
education of the base and relevant content.INNO VATIVE BUSINESS MODELS FOR EXPA NDING FIBER- OPTIC NETW ORKS AND CL OSING THE ACCESS GAPS87
Box 5.4: SugarNet/Voneus: Bringing Fixed Wireless Broadband to Rural England 
In the past few years, several U.K. broadband ISP startups have utilized fixed wireless technology to 
overcome the rural connectivity gap created by the lack of suitable fixed infrastructure available through the incumbent BT. Oxfordshire startup SugarNet and their acquirer, Voneus, use a hybrid fiber-wireless broadband solution that extends high-speed broadband to target communities. It offers pack -
ages of 20-50 Mbps symmetrical for less than £35 per month (about $46).
The business model is based on cooperation with local broadband activists or community action groups 
in rural areas. Voneus solicits expressions of interest from a minimum number of households in a com -
munity. Once community involvement is secured, it creates a backhaul connection to its core fibernetwork. Installation costs to Voneus are defrayed by the U.K. government’s program of Better Broadband vouchers, which qualifying individual customers receive gratis and then give to Voneus. There is no installation cost to individuals.
In January 2018, Voneus was granted additional powers by the U.K.’s communications regulator, Ofcom, 
to help it accelerate the rollout of superfast broadband services to hard-to-reach rural U.K. communities. These powers allow Voneus to construct infrastructure on public land, and to take rights over privateland, either with the agreement of the landowner or by applying to the county court. It also conveys cer -
tain immunities from the town and country planning legislation in the form of permitted development.

Box 5.5: Project Isizwe: Bringing Free Wi-Fi Connectivity to Communities in South Africa 
Project Isizwe is a South Africa-based nonprofit 
Wi-Fi service provider. Its business is based on convincing local authorities to rollout of a Wi-Fi network providing free access to end users across free Internet zones (FIZ). For the initial payment, the local authorities prepay for the rollout of the network as well as bandwidth for a period of time. Coverage is generally targeted at the most impoverished areas within the local 
jurisdiction. Since launching in 2013, Project Isizwe has set up six networks with more than 3.8 million unique connected accounts and 600,000 users per month across 1076 FIZ. Further rollouts are planned.
The business model for the local authority is based on the view that there will be an increase in GDP in 
their tax catchment area, thereby increasing tax revenues. This increase in tax revenue is expected to pay for the initial upfront investment and ongoing running costs, meaning that the project becomes self-funding (tax increment financing). In addition to the increase in tax revenue, there are also other opportunities for local authorities to generate additional revenue though selling advertising and sponsorship.
There is no authentication and users are required to provide their own Wi-Fi-connected device. Each 
device is generally limited to download in the range of 250-500 MB per day. Additionally, there is a signif -
icant amount of on-net information which is also exempt from the usage cap including relevant learning and teaching content (Siyavula); books designed to be read on a small format device (Fundza); jobs portal providing job opportunities, résumé-writing advice and interview skills (Gumtree); curated content in videos, televised lessons, digital textbooks, podcasts, presentations, worksheets, and past exam papers; and Wi-Fi TV (video-on-demand service covering range of topics including education, entrepreneurship, fashion, and sports produced by young community journalists).
In addition to this model, Isizwe is developing a new innovative business model through its Khaye-Fi 
project based in Khayelitsha, one of the poorest areas in Cape Town. The idea is to reward users with Internet connectivity in return for performing certain actions—in this case recycling. In the initial proof of concept, users will be offered 100 MB of data in return for every kilogram of recyclable goods delivered. Once the proof of concept is complete, additional mechanisms for users to gain access will be rolled out, including completing microlessons. The local authority investment Khaye is seeking to build relationships with local partners to sponsor the service as well as provide relevant local content, training, and data collection. Sponsors will have access to marketing, research, customers, and corporate social responsi -
bility investment opportunities. In addition, Wi-Fi champions will be engaged in the community to drive community understanding and provide feedback on the project.

TV White Space as a Low-Cost 
Alternative for Rural Coverage
TV white space (TVWS) is an interesting low-cost 
alternative technology for rural coverage that has gained some momentum in recent years because of standardization by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Nevertheless, no large-scale deployments are currently known. 
The major advantage of this type of technology is 
that the frequencies used, in the range of 450 to 800 MHz, allow for non-line-of-sight (NLOS) transmis -
sion, with low power, over relatively long distances, typically 15 kilometers. This spectrum provides deep coverage for long-distance Internet connectivity to underserved communities over hills and through foliage. Another advantage is that the technology is useful in remote regions with difficult terrain, again because of the NLOS feature. A further advantage of the lower frequencies is that there is good penetra -
tion of the signal into homes.
The slight disadvantage is that because of the 
relatively low frequencies, the available bandwidth is restricted, although many vendors are now claiming that bandwidths of 100 Mbit/s are available on a shared basis.
The technology recently received a boost from 
the completion of the IEEE standard, 802.11af, or Wireless Regional Area Networks (WRAN), issued in 2014. The standard allows for spectrum sharing among white space devices and licensed services, and essentially ensures that the primary TV provider does not experience interference. As a result of this, many vendors are now producing standardized equipment, including Carlson Communications, Redline, Adaptrum, and many others.Typically, TVWS wireless technology may be com -
bined with DOCSIS 3.0 standards to be able to offer services into the home, with low-cost modems as the end device.
TVWS may be an interesting technology for remote 
rural districts, which consist of small and isolated villages. The NLOS feature enables the mast to be located in more convenient positions and the height of the mast does not need to be as high as with other technologies, significantly reducing costs. The technology is slowly gaining momentum but to date it is largely used in trial and niche situations, such as 4Afrika in Mawingu (see box 5.6). TENET, which part -
ners with television broadcasters to deliver service to education and research establishments in South Africa, is another example.
TVWS solutions are not without some controversy, as 
they are arguably an anomaly resulting from ineffi -
ciently allocated spectrum. It may be that, consider -
ing the cost and benefits of narrowing these buffer channels and making more spectrum available, more traditional allocations might offer better solutions for more end-users. 
As with all deployments into rural areas, one of 
the key components will be the middle mile as well as backbone connectivity, and it will be difficult to provide a commercially viable standalone solution. Interestingly, TVWS is now being explored as a mid -
dle-mile technology in rural areas where the required bandwidth may be more modest.90
Box 5.6: 4Afrika: TV White Space in Rural Areas
4Afrika was launched by Microsoft, with stated 
aims to develop affordable access, skills, and innovation on the African continent. Since 2013, 4Afrika has brought more than 500,000 SMEs online, upskilled about 800,000 Africans, and helped 82 local startups to grow their ventures.
As part of the 4Afrika initiative Microsoft has 
launched 15 TVWS connectivity pilots across 
many countries in Africa, including Kenya, South Africa, Namibia, Tanzania, and Ghana.
Another TVWS project is Mawingu (which is Kiswahili for cloud), an initiative with the Kenyan Ministry 
of Information and Communications and Kenyan Internet service provider Indigo Telecom, to deliver low-cost, high-speed, wireless broadband in an affordable way (that is, for a few dollars per month). In addition, its aim was to create new opportunities for commerce, education, healthcare, and delivery of government services across Kenya. It is the first deployment of solar-powered basestations working together with TV white spaces to deliver high-speed Internet access to areas currently lacking even basic electricity. In most of Kenya, broadband penetration is at global lows: nearly 72 percent of Kenyans are without Internet, affecting the quality of education, politics, and even healthcare.
The project, part of Microsoft’s 4Afrika initiative, has spurred several other programs, including a tele -
medicine service, diagnosis applications, and efforts related to government participation and agriculture. 
Ultimately as a business model, traditional financial self-sustainability of these initiatives may not be possible (or even desirable). 4Afrika may be better thought of as a double bottom-line initiative for sponsors, for example, reliant on continued financial support to raise positive brand recognition or other CSR benefits.

Current Satellite Business 
Models
There are a number of satellite systems that employ 
relatively new high-throughput technology to provide broadband backhaul and access services where fiber and terrestrial wireless broadband means are not available or too expensive to deploy. Avanti Eco provides access either through a vertically integrated model (serving end-users directly) or a wholesale play for local service providers. It has benefited from a startup grant from the European Space Agency and plans to rollout access to over 500,000 communities in Africa in the next few years. 
O3b, short for “the Other 3 Billion,” has been suc -
cessfully providing backhaul to remote locations for 
several years. It supplies wireless backhaul to public service providers in Africa, the Pacific islands, and particular verticals such as the marine transport and energy sectors (see box 5.7).INNO VATIVE BUSINESS MODELS FOR EXPA NDING FIBER- OPTIC NETW ORKS AND CL OSING THE ACCESS GAPS91

O3b advertises itself as providing a “fiber speed, 
satellite reach” technology with latency compara -
ble to DSL or fiber, that is, below 150 ms.
The technology is based on deploying medium 
Earth orbit (MEO) satellites operating in the Ka band and using steerable spot beams to deliver connectivity to target customers. The satel -
lite-earth gateway connectivity is delivered by a 
number of earth-based installations and the satellites feature seamless handover functionality. The initial satellites built by Boeing were deployed in 2013-14. Today there are nine in operational use with another eight more expected by 2019. 
In addition to expanding coverage, O3b has been working on improving its technology. mPower satel -
lites, promising delivery speeds of multiple gigabits to a single spot and having 30,000 spot beams, are 
planned to be deployed in 2021.
O3b has developed four key products aimed at verticals:
 •O3bTrunk—providing backhaul Internet connectivity for ISPs,
 •O3bCell—a mobile cell backhaul solution,
 •O3bMaritime—marine vessel Internet backhaul, and 
 •O3bEnergy—offshore connectivity solutions for the oil and gas sector.

5.3. Challenges for Middle-Mile Initiatives in Rural Areas
Middle-mile initiatives reaching rural areas have gen-
erally been supported by state funds. However, delays and funds mismanagement have been observed. 
Middle-mile developments aim to bridge the dis -
tances between the core national network and the 
individual access network “islands.” The objective is to bring the network closer to the community from where it will be distributed via the access network to all the households and businesses. The business model is usually based on subsidizing a national telecommunications provider or creating a new entity that will receive the funds to build and operate the new network (see table 5.3). The service is either passive (for example, dark fiber, as in the case of Est-Win in Estonia) or active (for example, as is the case for RO-NET Romania), and is provided on a carrier-neutral basis and priced based on cost or cost-plus principles. The allocation of network re -
sources differs in each case, but it is generally based 92
on a “first come, first served basis.” However, com -
plaints have arisen of biased and unfair allocation of 
network resources among service providers.
Payment for the network is either upfront, in which 
the network is built from available funds (as in Estonia), or the successful bidder builds the network, also reusing its existing infrastructure to reduce costs, and then claims the money from public funds. 
In some cases, funds are being utilized to support 
the upgrade of the existing incumbent’s telecommu -
nications infrastructure but this has been branded by service providers as “unfair” and not in keeping with the initial purpose. For example, in Estonia the middle-mile project was used as a subsidy for mobile tower connectivity instead of connecting rural areas with fiber (see box 5.8). 
In Romania, the winners of the tenders to build a sim -
ilar middle-mile network, RO-NET, were Romtelecom 
and Cosmote, both part of the Deutsche Telekom group, since merged into a single entity (for more details, see box 5.9).
A very different example is provided by TOP-IX, an 
initiative supported by the European Commission’s Connected Communities Initiative (CCI) and imple -
mented in partnership with the World Bank. TOP-IX currently operates an Internet exchange point and a neutral backhaul network of more than 30 points of presence (POPs) in the Piedmont region of Italy. TOP-IX controls a network of more than 1,000 kilometers of fiber-optic infrastructure providing broadband access to more than 200,000 end-users, and plans to add an additional 50 points of presence (POPs) for a total of €12 million. TOP-IX will leverage assets of existing utilities that have underused fiber-optic deployments, as well as high points, ducts, and other civil work passive infrastructure, that can be lever -
aged to deploy TOP-IX’s backhaul network. A core partner will be the Italian electricity grid operator Terna. TOP-IX believes that it can greatly extend its backhaul network in the rural areas profitably enough to attract adequate private investment. 
The CCI is also supporting other projects, for exam -
ple, in the Friuli Venezia Giulia (FVG) region of Italy 
and in rural regions of Portugal. The GANDHI project in FVG will create a PPP SPV that provides technology neutral wholesale broadband access according to the conditions defined by the regulator, AGCOM. The PPP will be implemented in coordination between Regione FVG, its in-house telecoms team, Insiel, and the awarded private next generation access (NGA) operator(s). In Portugal, The DSTelecom project will deploy greenfield high-speed broadband infrastruc -
ture in four underserved regions—Alentejo, Algarve, Lower Minho, and the Northern Region. DSTelecom has received equity funding from a large European infrastructure fund, Cube Infrastructure Managers.

whom are the biggest telecommunications operators in the country. EstWin is funded by European 
Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), among others.
EstWin is a nonprofit organization with transparent and published financial information, providing equal 
access to its passive fiber infrastructure to all licensed service providers. 
The network aims to bring fiber within 1.5 kilometers of 98 percent of all residential buildings, compa -
nies, and public authorities. In order to do that, about 6000 kilometers of fiber was to be laid out to 1400 
fiber sites. As of 2017 the ELASA web site reports the rollout of 5,825 kilometers of fiber and 2308 total network connections, including 566 local government buildings.
The EstWin investments are intended to stimulate complementary deployments of last-mile connections 
by commercial telecommunications operators. However, market failures persist in many areas. 
In some cases, the villages have taken the initiative. An example is the village of Rääka in Suure-Jaani mu-
nicipality in Viljandi County, which established a 2.5-kilometer fiber connection from the village to a nearby broadband network at the beginning of 2013. Communications operator Elion prepared the design, the villagers bought the cable, the local firms laid it, and the local government sorted out the planning permission and offered as much support as it could. Each household had to invest more than €1000. 
For more details, see appendix, page 171.
EstWin is a fiber middle-mile project 
established in Estonia in 2009 with the aim of reaching rural communi -
ties that were marked as “white ar -
eas” under EU broadband availability categories, meaning an absence of broadband suppliers and none expected in the near future. The project was initially established as a PPP project between four Estonian government ministries and the Estonian Broadband Development Foundation (ELASA) representing the private sector. The founding members of ELASA are Elion, Elisa, Eltel, EMT, Ericsson, Levira, Televõrgu, and Tele2—among Figure B5.8.1: Fiber Optic Backbone Network in Estonia, 2015

Box 5.9: RO-NET – Middle-Mile Open-Access Network Provider in White Areas in Romania
RO-NET is an initiative that started in 2014 with 
the aim of supporting the deployment of a back -
haul network to white areas of Romania where broadband is not planned or available—areas comprising a total of nine million rural inhabitants or 47.2 percent of the total population. At the project start, the Romanian authorities identi -
fied 783 rural localities allocated among seven regional projects. 
The project is defined as a design, build, and operate (DBO) model where financial assistance was applicable to the design and deployment of new backhaul infrastructure and no aid is to be granted for the operation of the network. The public support takes the form of grants. A significant part (about 82 percent) of the €84 million budget is funded from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) (€68.5 million) and the remainder from the state budget (€15.5 million). The infrastructure is to remain under public ownership and the concessionaires will pay a fee of 18 percent of the investment value for an 18-year concession and will have the right to retain the remaining revenues generated from man -
aging and operating the networks. The concessionaire also has the option to purchase the respective network and its facilities, subject to a prior government decision transferring those assets from public to private property. 
Selection was based on an open tender process for the seven regions with contracts awarded to the 
applicants presenting the most economically advantageous offer (that is, least financial subsidy required) among other parameters for selection. The process awarded Romtelecom and Cosmote agreements to implement the projects. The two companies are indirectly controlled by German group Deutsche Telekom. Romtelcom won the contract for four of the regions and Cosmote for the other three.
Infrastructure sharing was defined within the process and administered by the regulator, resulting in 
about 33 percent of the network planned in the project to be built on the basis of existing physical sup -
port infrastructure. Open access to the new network is given on the active layer, and made available on a “first come, first served” basis. Service pricing for wholesale access will be based on the prices already set by the regulator, ANCOM, for similar regulated services and, in the absence of such regulated wholesale prices, on the average wholesale prices in more competitive areas of the country.
However, issues were encountered during the implementation, especially delays in the authorization 
process, and by the end of 2015 works were completed for only 99 of the 783 localities planned. Further delays were reported in 2016 because of payment issues and, as of 2017, the project was still not reported as finalized.

5.4. T owerCo and Mobile Infrastructure Sharing Models
Infrastructure sharing models relevant to the 
last mile and middle mile can been seen along a spectrum of network component sharing, from the passive sharing of towers to backhaul sharing to increasingly involved forms of radio access network sharing.
Passive site sharing  is an extremely common form 
of mobile infrastructure sharing. While MNOs typical -
ly build wholly separate networks in the early period 
of competition, they usually grow to appreciate the cost savings benefits in more mature periods of service delivery and begin to voluntarily share sites. Regulators have, of course, also often played a part in encouraging or requiring site sharing in the interest of reducing redundant building, as well as environmental and/or aesthetic concerns. In recent years, specialized TowerCos have emerged to take on joint builds and operation. One of the first developing world examples of MNOs transferring such passive assets to a third party for operation and further expansion was the creation of Indus Towers by Bharti Airtel, Vodafone, and Idea Cellular in India. An inter -
esting intermediate form is where two or more MNOs effectively create a joint venture to plan the building and operating of new towers in rural areas that they then share. In Bangladesh, Grameenphone and Banglalink have a long history of such an arrange -
ment. However, even when the operations are made sustainable through a shared-cost model, the initial CAPEX investment is still often a barrier to making the case commercially viable. In these cases, complemen -
tary government financial incentives might increase the model’s viability. 
26 MVNOs are differentiated by varying levels of dependency on the network of others. See, for example, OECD 2017.Fiber backhaul sharing  is where MNOs agree to 
jointly construct and operate or otherwise share connectivity from radio access sites to core network meet points. A recent example of this is the German Telefonica and Vodafone agreement to split the cost and/or construction of backhaul links. Telefonica and Vodafone subsidiaries have a long history of network sharing across Europe. 
Geographic roaming is where two or more mobile 
network operators agree to share access networks to cover areas to mutually extend networks that one op -
erator alone could not economically undertake on its own. There is also the mandated form of geographic roaming, typically referred to as national roaming, in which the state requires that incumbents provide access to their networks to ensure that new entrants can offer full national coverage. Typically, these mandates are effective for a set period of time so that new entrants are incentivized to continue their own rollouts. A voluntary example of this is the recent GSMA-spearheaded case in Tanzania managed to provide rural 4G coverage for 72,000 inhabitants by applying the network sharing concept—implemented as roaming across a triparty network (see box 5.10). 
Mobile wholesale networks  can take the quite 
common form of MNOs providing network infrastruc -
ture and service to mobile virtual network operators 
(MVNOs), or the newer form of single wholesale network, which in a sense turns other MNOs in the market into a type of MVNO for certain services.

Box 5.10: Tanzania – Shared Mobile Rural Infrastructure via Roaming
The GSMA supported a rural connectivity project, the first of its kind in Africa, bringing together three of Tanzania’s biggest operators (Tigo, Vodacom, and Airtel), in a bid to provide 3G connectivity to selected remote rural locations. Six 3G pilot sites (two from each operator) were activated in 2017. Rural network national roaming was enabled on all sites with an addressable mar -
ket of 43,000 mobile customers benefiting from competitive retail offering from all three opera -
tors utilizing a single infrastructure deployment.
In July 2017, the GSMA visited two villages, 
Mingumbi and Nambpunga, located within the range of the new network pilot sites. Both villages are located about 30 kilometers from the nearest main road. It was observed that uptake of mobile 
broadband services around pilot sites showed positive results. Despite a hesitant first two months, because of technical issues and delayed roaming enablement, adoption levels increased significantly to reach 95 percent of the addressable market (64 percent of the population) by the end of month four. High demand limited the usability of the network during the day, leading many users to wait until the evening to make use of freer capacity.
The network sharing via roaming model revealed significant benefits on both the supply and demand 
sides. On the supply side, roaming has allowed operators to reduce their costs significantly, allowing for deployment in unserved rural areas. From an adoption perspective, roaming has boosted adoption as it introduced more choice and better availability of products, including SIM cards.Source: TMG/Salience Consulting.INNO VATIVE BUSINESS MODELS FOR EXPA NDING FIBER- OPTIC NETW ORKS AND CL OSING THE ACCESS GAPS97
Box 5.11: Mexico’s Red Compartida Project: Mobile Wholesale Broadband Network
Despite a successful outcome, the investment case, given fiscal constraints, appears difficult and is a 
barrier for further rural mobile broadband coverage expansion. Over a short period, although the sites showed steadily increasing revenue reaching a level ensuring site viability from an operational cost perspective, CAPEX and tax levels render the rural sites unprofitable. Thus, the savings generated by the sharing agreement are not sufficient to compensate for the whole investment. Other solutions, such as government financial support in the form of grant or equity partnerships, implementation of low-cost access solutions, lower taxes for selected sites, or zero-rated long-term debt, will be necessary. GSMA’s report concluded that the provision of correctly allocated subsidies can significantly help mobile opera -
tors to scale the current national roaming agreement.

In 2014, the Mexican government passed wide-ranging telecom -
munications reforms that included instruction to the Mexican 
telecommunications regulator to establish a wholesale-only wireless network—a “carrier’s carrier” known as Red Compartida that will sell mobile-network capacity to all newcomers. The 
network was defined to be deployed and operated through private capital, attracting large investments and jobs in Mexico. The initiative’s aims are 1) optimizing the usage of assigned spectrum (700 MHz), 2) cost reductions, and 3) increased coverage in regions without services.
The bid was awarded in 2016 to a consortium called ALTAN—which includes Axtel, Megacable, the 
International Finance Corporation (IFC), and Dutch and Chinese investors. Under the terms of the PPP, the Mexican government is providing the radio spectrum and the use of the backbone network devel -
oped by the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE). ALTÁN Redes, as the private partner of the PPP, will contribute the financial investment and proven technical expertise. The network concession is for a term of 20 years with an option to extend for another 20 years.
In December 2017, it was reported that Red Compartida was set to exceed its March 31, 2018 obligation 
to begin operations and cover 30 percent of the Mexican population, with anticipated actual availability between 33 percent and 35 percent. Further, the network was on track to exceed 50 percent coverage by end-2018. Red Compartida launched on March 22, 2018 with coverage in excess of 30 percent. The network will grow to provide services nationwide using an all-IP network and 4G LTE technology reach -
ing 92.2 percent of the Mexican population. 
One advantage of a wholesale-only network is that many new entrants can enter the Mexican telecom -
munications consumer market at once. Nondiscriminatory price plans are approved by the Mexican 
regulator. Red Compartida can also be seen as a response to the persistent competition problems in the 98
Mexican mobile market, where competitive forces and other more traditional forms of regulation had 
proven ineffective in reducing the dominant provider’s entrenched market position. 
The project has received positive as well as negative comments on its impact on the competitive environ -
ment. Altan is progressing well in building out its network and gaining clients. Its impact on the market 
will have to be demonstrated over time.

5.5. T echnologies with WIP Business Models
Innovations in Low-Cost 
Satellite Deployments
In recent years, several competing LEO satellite 
constellations have been funded that promise to change the current perception of satellite broadband service–expensive, poor latency technology which is a last resort for residents/businesses that can afford it. 
Most of these business models focus on the satellite 
broadband providers offering wholesale broadband services to in-country players, such as ISPs and MNOs. In addition, these satellite providers intend to have arrangements with in-country operators who will assist them with: (i) managing customer relations and billing; (ii) distributing and installing the termi -
nals; and (iii) applying for national service licenses. However, all of these initiatives are still in the tech -
nical concept development and testing stage, and the business models and pricing have not been fully disclosed or determined. 
These satellite broadband providers differ in the ser -
vices they plan to provide and their target customer:
 •Direct-to-Home (DTH) : OneWeb plans to 
provide DTH broadband service to end users 
(see box 5.12). The system promises to provide global coverage and be relatively inexpensive with end-user terminals that can be self- or easily-installed. However, OneWeb mentioned in its response to a recent Ofcom consultation that the service might need to be subsidized for some rural deployments. The company also claims that it has sold most of the capacity of the initial 648 satellites, but the sums have not been disclosed.
 •Fixed Backhaul Service : Other providers such as 
LeoSAT and Kalo are offering backhaul services to villages, mobile basestations, or business custom -
ers. This is more commercially viable because the capacity and service cost is then divided between the number of end users (as in the case of the village, or mobile cell) or provided to an entity that has much higher affordability.
 •Mobile Broadband Service: Some providers, such as Kalo, are offering services to moving objects, such as cars and boats, through an innovative antenna design that allows high-speed satellite communications on the move.
 •Motorized Earth Station Antennas (MESAs) : 
MESA systems track inclined orbit satellites for providing rural access. Concero Connect is an example.INNO VATIVE BUSINESS MODELS FOR EXPA NDING FIBER- OPTIC NETW ORKS AND CL OSING THE ACCESS GAPS99
Box 5.12: OneWeb – Low Earth Orbit Satellites for Internet Access
OneWeb has visionary targets of “connecting every 
unconnected school” by 2022, and “bridging the digital divide” by 2027. It is aiming to do this by deploying a constellation of satellites that are capable of beaming affordable Internet worldwide, enabling better and cheaper coverage for existing networks and connectiv -
ity in areas of the world that are currently offline. 
OneWeb acquired the satellite spectrum that was for -
merly owned by SkyBridge and is planning to initially 
deploy 900 satellites at an altitude of 1200 kilometers that will work in Ku-band and Ka-band spectrum. 
The onground deployment has plans for 50 to 60 satellite network portals (SNPs) beaming Internet traf -
fic to and from satellites. Pilot satellite launch is planned for late 2018 with full system deployment to be completed in the following years. To manufacture these low-cost, ultrahigh performing satellites at high volumes, the company has established a dedicated manufacturing facility as a joint venture between OneWeb and Airbus. 
OneWeb will offer global, ubiquitous broadband services in a commercial agreement with Softbank. It will 
offer solutions for the retail market as well as carrier wholesale and enterprise solutions. From a coverage perspective, it could bring affordable Internet to wireless-dependent communities currently unserved or underserved by terrestrial networks and which remain so for the foreseeable future. OneWeb’s system is designed to avoid interference with geostationary satellites as well as terrestrial wireless service. 
The success of OneWeb will be dependent on its technical and operational success as well as its ability to 
achieve commercial success.

Drones, Balloons, and Other
Nonpermanent Structures forLast-Mile and Middle-Mile Access
Recently, there has been significant investment in de -
veloping nonpermanent aerial infrastructure that can 
be used to provide middle- and last-mile coverage. These solutions can be categorized as short-term and long-term solutions (see table 5.5).
Table 5.5: Nonpermanent Structures for Middle- and 
Last-Mile Access
Short-term solutions Drones, Helikites
Long-term solutions Loon, Aquila
Short-T erm Solutions
These solutions are designed to provide fast-to-de -
ploy coverage in a particular geographical footprint 
for temporary periods—from a few hours to a few months. Often local power and local backhaul are required to maintain coverage. Individual footprints per device are relatively small; however, devices can, in some cases, be daisy-chained together to provide larger footprints. 
The technologies used include:
 •Tethered drones. These fly at between 400 
and 1000 feet, attached to the ground by a thin tether that carries both power and connectivity. Each drone can provide coverage of about half a square mile and although they can be flown indefinitely using the tethered power supply, they are designed to fly for about three days. Once in a location with power and backhaul, they can be deployed quickly. Drones are normally equipped with 4G LTE antennas, but sometimes Wi-Fi is used. Customers are not required to have any particular equipment to connect. CyPhy Works’ PARC drone is an example of a tethered drone.
 •Untethered drones. These are similar to tethered drones but can fly to higher altitudes and provide larger coverage areas. Backhaul is through wireless connectivity, usually to the same location that is controlling the drone. Flight times are short—normally just a few hours.
 •Tethered Helikites. These helium-filled kites rise to about 7000 feet and provide a much larger coverage footprint. They are designed to remain airborne for up to three months and are adept at coping with most weather conditions. The tether provides power to the Helikite, allowing it to ascend or descend, as well as powering the onboard 3G or 4G antennas. Backhaul is provided through satellite—the Helikite transmits in S-band spectrum to satellites, which would normally be terminated through K-band terrestrial receivers. Individual Helikites can be linked through micro-wave backhaul to create quite substantial cover-age areas. Customers are able to use standard mobile phones to access the service.
While the use cases for drones and the Helikite are similar, drones are favored for shorter-term, smaller coverage situations when the speed of providing coverage is a high priority. Use cases for both drones and the Helikite include providing expedient cover -
age in the following types of situations:
 •Disaster relief.  If infrastructure is damaged 
because of disaster, these solutions can be deployed to provide coverage in critical areas while more permanent solutions are put in place. 
 •Capacity relief. These technologies can be used when significant spikes in capacity demands are expected. Examples include sporting events and concerts.

 •Planned temporary coverage.  They can also be 
useful to provide coverage in uncovered areas 
where the need for coverage can be planned. Examples include music festivals and sporting events.
 •Military applications.  In addition, these tech -
nologies can be used to provide coverage and surveillance in combat situations.
BUSINESS CASE
Currently, short-term nonpermanent solutions are 
deployed as part of a technical solution by carriers for particular short-term capacity or coverage needs. In our case studies, for example, EE Helikites, none have been used to provide permanent last-mile connectivity and it does not appear that this is being actively pursued. The low-flying drones are reliant on substantial ground infrastructure for their connectiv -
ity and, given their coverage areas, are unlikely to be particularly useful for providing coverage in regions that already have poor infrastructure. Helikites have better potential given the satellite backhaul, larger coverage areas, and longer flight times, but presently little research exists to support their use to provide a long-term last-mile access solution.
Long-T erm Solutions
The two most cited initiatives that focus on creating long-term, nonpermanent last-mile and middle-mile coverage solutions are the Loon (see box 5.13) and Aquila projects (see box 5.14). The key differences between them are as follows:
 •Development Stage. Loon was in development longer than Aquila and has completed proof of concept, and is complemented with an auto launcher. Successful trials have been undertaken in a number of countries with balloons staying airborne significantly longer than the planned 90 days. Although no date for commercial launch has been published, the technology appears to have passed through various key development hurdles. Aquila was conceived to support the use of high-altitude platform station for middle-mile connectivity to address the backhaul gap in suburban and rural areas. Following various years of technology development and testing. In June, 2018 Facebook announced it was no longer designing and building aircraft for project Aquila, and that it would instead focus on working with other companies developing high-altitude plat -
form station technologies (Maguire 2018).
 •Business model.  Neither company has fully 
defined their project’s business model, initially fo -
cusing on developing and testing the technology for these new connectivity platforms. Aquila was developed by Facebook’s Connectivity Lab as an approach to closing the “backhaul gap” affecting broadband expansion, especially in suburban and rural communities. Loon is planning to provide wholesale access through operators on a reve -
nue-sharing basis.
 •Technical.  Though there are clearly many 
differences in the technologies being used, it is currently too early in the development cycle to identify any clear differences from the customer’s perspective. Both solutions sought to bring broadband speeds to large rural coverage areas using 3G/4G and possibly Wi-Fi.
Compared to traditional coverage networks, these solutions have a very different commercial structure. Particular points of note include the following:
 •These solutions both have significant upfront capital expenditure followed by lower ongoing operational expense. While this is similar to traditional mobile networks, most of this capital expenditure is focused on the initial research and development rather than on building the network itself. Consequently, once these solutions are technically proven, it will be possible to cover large areas with much lower capital and operational expenditure costs than a traditional operator.102
 •Time to deploy is much lower than traditional 
networks, and in the event that network takeup is lower than expected, the equipment can be quickly repurposed to cover a different area. 
 •Given the investment required to develop these solutions, it is likely that for the foreseeable future these coverage areas will best be served by at most two operators, and most likely one operator—creating monopoly or duopoly market structures.
 •Content providers will now be network own -
ers meaning that the value chain is significantly larger than for pure network operators, giving additional breadth for commercial risks to be taken. This creates the opportunity for different revenue and business models based on selling or monetizing content opportunities that are not available for typical network operators.
These long-term nonpermanent solutions offer the potential for radically different business models, including:
 •Building at risk. As the infrastructure can be redeployed relatively easily to other areas, it is pos-sible to build coverage over an area with a more speculative risk profile. This means that areas that would be considered too marginal for traditional deployments, even if the costs were the same, can now be built to test the commercial viability.
 •Risk sharing between content and network providers. As content providers, Google and Facebook are now investing in network infrastruc -
ture and the risk or success is being shared with local infrastructure owners. Google has proposed a revenue-sharing model whereby the local op -
erator manages the sales and customer service and splits the revenue with Google. This means that the local operators can support operations in these areas with relatively little investment and, consequently, much lower risk. •International networks.  Depending on the 
scale of the deployment, it is possible that the network could cover areas across borders. While this could create significant regulatory issues, it provides the opportunity to leverage backhaul options in neighboring countries if these are more attractive than local alternatives.
 •Backhaul competition.  As these networks are 
easily able to change the backhaul being used, both in terms of the physical location of the backhaul and the technology used, they have the opportunity to take advantage of the technology improvements (for example if satellite becomes more economical) or to shift to new backhaul in -
frastructure when it becomes available. This may create more competitive backhaul markets and, as it is possible to aggregate backhaul demand from a large region to a single point, potentially this could justify building new terrestrial backhaul that is not currently viable.
 •Potential unblocking of regulatory and logis -
tical issues.  As these solutions will cover large 
amounts of terrain requiring only a single point of backhaul, it is likely that regional bureaucratic logistical issues can be minimized. Further, in jurisdictions where the regulatory environment is complicated, the relatively simple nature of the requirements from the local country should improve the speed of deployment. Indeed, in the event that local backhaul is not available, it is possible that this could be obtained from a neighboring country or, with improved econom -
ics, from satellite services.
 •Content-based revenue models. Tying into the 
content base, where the content providers are providing network infrastructure for last-mile access, there is also an opportunity for third parties to pay to subsidize the costs of Internet access (two-sided market model). While the concept of selling access to content providers to subsidize the costs of network deployment has been considered before, it has not been INNO VATIVE BUSINESS MODELS FOR EXPA NDING FIBER- OPTIC NETW ORKS AND CL OSING THE ACCESS GAPS103
commercially viable because of the upfront costs 
and the questionable ability of content providers to monetize the investment. With lower upfront costs (after the research and development) and proven ability of companies like Google to create value from content, there is a good opportunity to use content to subsidize the prices end-users pay. This could mean that end-users have Internet access at a substantial discount, or even for free.
Box 5.13: Project Loon: Balloon-Powered Internet Access for Rural and Nonreachable Areas
Project Loon is a research and development project being developed by Google X with the mission of providing Internet access to rural and remote areas. The proposed solution is to use a series of balloons that act like mobile towers. Each balloon will cover an area of over 5000 square kilometers. For backhaul, the balloons will form chains of up to five balloons with the last linking to a ground-based tower with each chain in the link being up to 40 kilometers long. Initially, this means that ground towers could be up to 
1,000 kilometers apart, which is expected to grow to 10,000 kilometers, compared to perhaps 40 kilome -
ters for a ground-based network. To date, the longest a balloon has stayed airborne is 187 days, though commercial deployments are expected to be closer to 100 days. Once a balloon descends, it is collected and returned to a launching station for redeployment. Balloons are launched to provide coverage in a cluster over a certain area. In order to maintain position, the altitude of individual balloons is adjusted to move them into a prevailing wind that can move them in the appropriate direction. 
The business model for commercialization of this technology has not been fully defined, though there are 
a few key elements. In order for customers to be able to use existing mobile phones and other connected devices, the balloons provide coverage using the LTE standard. This means that they are required to oper-ate in spectrum bands owned by a local telecommunications company. For the moment, the proposal is for revenue generated to be shared between the local operator, who will provide use of the spectrum and ground backhaul, and Google, which will provide the balloons and related infrastructure. Google has stated that they see enormous revenue potential in the business given the huge number of people that could be covered. The current view is that, if successful, Project Loon could deliver in the order of $4-10 billion in revenues annually. There is also an opportunity for Google to restrict users to using Google services, though the company has stated that this is not their intention. While the technology is clearly the most innovative part of Project Loon to date, the business model is also groundbreaking. The investment, timeframe, and risk of the project mean that few companies possess the resources necessary to undertake such a project. Given the amount of risk involved and the lack of alternatives, it is possible that Google will be able to negotiate strong revenue shares from the local operators. Such a “mega play,” offering the service in multiple countries, is rare given the level of risk and could serve as an example for similar large scale multicountry initiatives.

Box 5.14: Aquila: Drones Providing Connectivity to the Ground
Unlike Loon, solar aircraft solutions, like the one 
developed in the Aquila project, were intended to prove the viability of providing backhaul connec -
tivity to fixed aggregation points on the ground (for example, mobile basestations, Wi-Fi hotspots, and so on) operated by retail service providers (for example, mobile providers, wireless ISPs).Each drone could cover a radius of around 50 kilometers and would connect to ground stations or gateways linking it to the Internet using mi -
crowave or millimeter wave spectrum. Each drone was anticipated to remain airborne for 90 days using solar power during the day, and stored battery power at night. 
The business model for commercialization of drone-based services, as with balloons, continues to 
develop. In the case of projects focused on the middle mile, such as Aquila, backhaul connectivity to the base station or network access point would rely on frequencies designated for high altitude platform stations by the ITU. Once backhaul connectivity was delivered to the base station or access point, last-mile connectivity to the end user would then be offered by the mobile provider and/or wireless ISP using licensed or unlicensed spectrum. 
The investment, timeframe, and risk of the project limit such undertakings to companies, such as 
Facebook, with significant resources at their disposal. Lessons learned from Aquila may support the many innovative business models based on high altitude platform stations in the future, provided that the technology can be deployed on commercially viable terms.

5.6. Business Model Enabling T echnologies
Open-Source Software 
Applications
Using open-source software applications, rather than 
traditional cellular technology, provides opportunities for lowering solution costs and stimulating innovation. 
OpenBTS, an open-source application that substi -
tutes Internet Protocol and a software radio for 
traditional telecommunications cellular protocols and hardware, has been used by Endaga (see box 5.15), Vodafone Instant Network (see box 5.16), and Fairwaves projects to lower the cost of the overall solution. The solutions developed in this way are order-of-magnitude cheaper than traditional prod -
ucts—for example, Endaga’s CCN1 network box is priced at only $6,000.
The advantages of these open-source approaches 
have been proven before in the software industry, where open-source software has replaced a good deal of license fee-driven and closed, proprietary soft -
ware offerings. Anyone could download the software and start developing their own solution without any royalty or licensing restrictions—providing an ideal innovation platform for small startups. 
Box 5.15: Endaga – Network in a Box, Owned and Operated by Rural Communities
Endaga is a community-owned network concept that targets remote communities cut off from cellular connectivity, road, and grid access using micro basestations and a flexible backhaul solution for Internet connectivity. The idea was de -
veloped by students at the University of California, Berkeley who built a mobile telecommunications network that can run out of a small box attached to a tree in a remote village.
The main product is a network box called CCN1, which stands 
for “community cellular network.” It uses the open-source 
OpenBTS application as a replacement for traditional fee-driven radio products, delivering the turnkey box solution at $6,000 each. CCN1 communicates with mobile devices in the field using standard cell stacks and frequencies, converts them to Voice over IP (VoIP) and transmits via a satellite link or long-distance Wi-Fi. The box runs on dedicated 2G frequencies, provides cellular coverage across a 6.2-mile radius and draws about 80 watts of power, leading to the use of solar panels to power the first deployment.
Endaga’s proprietary software includes a management layer that includes billing and analytics functions 
for the entrepreneur/network operator. Endaga’s credit transfer system—where anyone on the network can move credit between accounts with an SMS—created a distribution system of credit transfer in the community. In a 1,500-person town in Papua, Indonesia, where the first box was installed in February 2013, the school with the box is collecting a total of $2,000 in revenue per month from 400 subscribers.
The main issue reported was that mobile operators own the radio spectrum, thereby making Endaga in 
theory an illegal service. Negotiating the business model with mobile operators has proved to be slow 106
and challenging. Also, the applicable spectrum licensing does not support the entrance of small players 
and, therefore, there is an unclear regulatory path to scale, which potentially deters future investors. In October 2015, the founders of Endaga joined Facebook effectively merging Endaga with Facebook’s open-source development of OpenCellular and CommunityCallManager.

Box 5.16: Vodafone Instant Network and Digital School in a Box Concept
The Vodafone Foundation Instant Network is an initiative by 
which rapid mobile coverage and services can be extended to a region in the case of emergency, offering easy transpor -
tation, rapid activation, and smart connectivity. 
The portable solution weighs 100 kilograms and can be trans-
ported on commercial flights in just four suitcases of less than 32 kilograms each. It can be activated within 40 minutes, and the established standalone network can support free local voice and SMS, as well as remote connectivity (GSM radio through satellite backhaul to a core network). Vodafone also deploys employee volunteers to deliver and run the missions. 
More recently, an 11-kilogram mobile network in a backpack version was developed to support small hu-manitarian field offices in disaster areas. To date, Vodafone has delivered 11 emergency response missions in the past five years, supporting natural disaster relief in Fiji, Vanuatu, the Philippines, Kenya, and Nepal, and refugee crisis response in Greece, Serbia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and South Sudan. 
Taking the initiative one step further, the Vodafone Foundation has partnered with the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to launch their Instant Network Schools program, enabling young refugees and teachers access to digital educational content and the Internet in some of the most marginalized communities where Vodafone operates. This offers a vital service when considering that the average length of time of displacement is 20 years, meaning a child can be born, raised, and com -
plete their entire schooling in the closed environment of a refugee camp with limited access to a quality education and the outside world.
Weighing just 56 kilograms, the digital school in a box can be set up in less than 20 minutes and can be 
used in classrooms where there is no electricity. The box includes a laptop, 25 tablets preloaded with ed -
ucational software, a projector, a speaker and a hotspot modem with 3G connectivity. To date, 31 Instant Network Schools have been delivered in seven refugee camps in Kenya, Tanzania, South Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, benefiting more than 43,000 refugee students and 600 teachers.

Lowering Costs of Local 
Networking 
There are a significant number of initiatives that 
are improving the rural network business case by lowering network CAPEX and OPEX. VANU and Virural offer compact carrier-grade outdoor basestations, a wide variety of media for backhaul, remote mon -
itoring, and software upgrades, and a solar power energy source. Virural produces a low-cost package consisting of a 15-foot mast, small-cell basestation, and a satellite or microwave dish for backhaul, as well as solar panels with backup batteries to power the network. It is a network extension initiative carried out in partnership with existing service providers. Virural takes a share of end-user revenues.
Wrightgrid similarly provides low-cost network 
extension technology in the form of solar-powered equipment for Wi-Fi hotspots and device charging. 
Village Telco (see box 5.17) offers a networking solu -
tion to connect local communities and telecommuni -
cations service providers at low cost. The network is 
designed to be self-installed by users with relatively limited technical knowledge.
Box 5.17: Village Telco, Do-It-Yourself Wi-Fi Mesh Local Community Network
Village Telco aims to provide low-cost Wi-Fi mesh networks for villages through the selling of “Mesh Potato” CPE. The Mesh Potato is a Wireless Access Point (WAP) combined with an analog telephony adapter (ATA) which gives a plain old telephone service (POTS) presentation. This means that standard fixed analog phones can be plugged into the Mesh Potato. All Mesh Potatoes automatically connect to one another, creating a mesh network. Effectively this is a low-cost way of deploying a local area telephone network. A Village Telco Entrepreneur Server, which will 
connect the local mesh network to the other telecommunications providers and allow for billing, network management, and so on, can easily be added by a local organization or entrepreneur. 
Software releases in 2016 have upgraded the network to allow it to carry data as well. The village is 
required to supply its own backhaul, but the Mesh Potatoes can then create a Wi-Fi data mesh network to which any Wi-Fi device can connect.
The rationale for the idea was noting that up to 50 percent of disposable income in some areas is spent 
on telecommunications, and a significant proportion of this spending would be used to communicate with people within the local village. Village Telco’s solution would mean that, for a single relatively small upfront cost, these local calls could be free and offnet calls would be cheaper than offerings from mobile networks. While not designed to fully substitute for mobile networks, Village Telco is designed to allow users to move a significant amount of their traffic onto a locally owned network and reduce the asso -
ciated telecommunications costs. With the inclusion of data services, the network can scale to reduce dependency on telecommunications providers.108
To date there have been eight publicized deployments around the world—three in South Africa and 
one each in Nigeria, Colombia, Puerto Rico, Timor-Leste, and Brazil. Though unpublished, total users are probably not more than in the tens of thousands. The various deployments have been prompted by different needs—for example to provide NGOs with an inexpensive network in Timor-Leste, or by entre -
preneurs providing data services in poorly served areas of South Africa. 
Village Telco’s business model is a “network in a box” approach and requires some investment from the 
village or organizer to buy a server and the Mesh Potatoes. While this means that Village Telco is able to be installed globally, it does require local investment and education for each individual deployment. The current business model is really a simple vendor solution that does not require a technically sophisticat -
ed installation. Combining it with an effective marketing or education business could potentially increase the scale of deployments.

Cross-sector infrastructure sharing is not a business model per se. It is a means by which a market segment 
may be addressed by leveraging existing assets. Pursuing cross-sector infrastructure sharing as a means of lowering deployment costs and increasing market entry has recently caught on in many countries. As attraction to the wholesale model for fiber provision (both in backhaul and access) has grown over the past two decades, so has the interest of nontelecommunications players in becoming telecommunications companies.
Utilities, especially electricity and water providers, have networks similar in structure to traditional telecommu -
nications networks and specific infrastructure that could be shared for telecommunications purposes (such as 
ducts, poles, and service plants, as detailed in figure 6.1). The percentage of infrastructure capable of sharing will vary between countries and specific utilities, but in general it will be quite significant and may lead to low -
er per-home connectivity costs. For example, Italy’s Enel announced duct shareability of 55-67 percent, and Norway’s Altibox, formed by an energy utility owned by 16 municipalities, has reported an average build cost estimate of €2,500 per home compared €3,400 for the incumbent Telenor.6. Cross-Sector Infrastructure Sharing110

Figure 6.2: Selected Examples of Fiber Companies Set Up by UtilitiesSource: based on Pupillo 2008.
Source: Arthur D. Little 2017.Moreover, utilities have generally far better rights of 
way and public land use arrangements, which are crucial for deployment of infrastructure, than tele -
communications operators. Utilities are also the first service providers to reach new greenfield develop -
ments and deploy infrastructure (in order to provide their own services). 
Traditionally, utilities have had a much wider role in 
backbone and backhaul fiber provision than access fiber. However, utilities in the developed world have often ventured into wholesale access and even retail plays.
The business cases for utilities vary from utilities as 
wholesale operators partnering with telecommunica -
tions operators to deploy infrastructure (for example, IWB and Swisscom in Switzerland), to state-created wholesale operators (such as Oman Broadband in Oman), to independent retail/wholesale operators (for example, M-Net in Germany and Optilink/EPB in the United States). Historically speaking, fewer utilities have offered full retail operations and more have focused on providing wholesale services that generate healthy new revenue streams without the distraction of selling and marketing telecommuni -

The business case for provision of fiber access by 
utilities usually relies on a mix of additional revenue and own-use for metering purposes, as well as capitalizing on the potential access to government funding dedicated to enabling broadband. 
More importantly, utilities can help to extend the 
reach of telecommunications operators to areas that were previously considered commercially nonviable (as in the case of Ireland). In the developing world, the experience with utilities in telecommunications service provision has been more mixed. 
Power and other utilities interested in telecommu -
nications infrastructure provision in developing 
countries have enjoyed a measure of success when focused on dark fiber or transmission services on core and backhaul networks. Table 6.1 provides a number of examples of these utilities.
Table 6.1: Examples of Utilities as Telecommunications Provider
Country Utility as telecommunications provider
Kenya KETRACO (the Kenya Electricity Transmission Company) has been granted a Network Facility Provider Tier 2 (NFPT2) license by the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) to enable the lease of excess fiber to licensed application and content service providers in Kenya. KETRACO will eventually have over 4,000 kilometers of optical fiber crisscrossing the country, spanning from Mombasa (submarine cables) to the borders of Ethiopia, Uganda, and Tanzania. 
Zambia ZESCO (the Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation) began leasing fiber cores when the first phase of its fiber-optic project was completed in 2008. This project, named FibreCom Broadband, has covered some 1,700 kilometers and connected most major centers and border areas. Several service providers, including MTN (Mobile Telephone Networks), Zamtel (Zambia Telecommunications Company), the Zambia Revenue Authority, and the Communications Authority of Zambia, are already using the ZESCO fiber-optic network. 
Namibia Nampower (the Namibian Power Corporation) is planning to lease spare fiber cores on its transmission lines to an ICT licensee that will operate the fiber on a commercial basis.
Botswana BPC (Botswana Power Corporation) has recently embarked upon an extensive power network expansion program expansion with all new lines to be equipped with optical ground wire (OPGW). Furthermore, a business partner has been identified via an open tendering process. This entity will be responsible for the day-to-day operation of the planned fiber-optic com -
mercialization business while BPC will receive a share of the revenue. BPC has also recently installed OPGW to the borders with Zimbabwe and South Africa. However, the utilities in these countries are yet to finish their respective installations to complete the international connections.
Zimbabwe Powertel Communications, a subsidiary of ZESA (Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority) Holdings, is a public data network operator fully licensed by the Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (POTRAZ) to provide data commu -
nications services. Currently, Powertel, as a state-owned Internet access provider, supplies data services carried on ZESA’s powerlines between Harare, Bulawayo, and Plumtree; more recently OPGW has been also been installed on the power line between Harare and Kariba. 112
Country Utility as telecommunications provider
Malawi ESCOM (the Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi) has been awarded a Carrier of Carriers 
license and has installed fiber-optic cables on its lines between Blantyre and Lilongwe, while another cable is connected to Mozambique and terminated in Maputo. In 2011, MTL (Malawi Telecommunications Limited) set up a leasing arrangement with ESCOM and now leases capacity from ESCOM to circumvent outages caused by regular vandalism of its underground cables.
Tanzania TANESCO (Tanzania Electric Supply Company) deployed a fiber-optic network serving 10 regions of Tanzania covering 2,050 kilometers as Phase 1 of a broader plan to rollout a fiber network. Financing for Phase 1 was secured through a development loan as well as a grant provided by the Government of Tanzania. Phase 2 is planned and involves extending the network to the North West of Tanzania allowing for the opportunity for international fiber connectivity to neighboring countries. The total fiber route length for Phase 2 will be about 1,500 kilometers.
Lesotho LEC (Lesotho Electricity Corporation) registered a subsidiary communications company in April 2015 with a mandate to manage its fiber-optic infrastructure on a commercial basis. The subsidiary obtained a communications license in June 2015 to lease fiber cores and capacity and began operating in October 2015. The business model involves the commercialization of existing fiber cores and subsequent reinvestment of realized revenue to expand the existing fiber-optic network. The LEC subsidiary has, to date, concluded indefeasible right of use and lease contracts with two large telecommunications operators in Lesotho. These contracts include the leasing of existing fiber cores as well as the attachment of third party-owned fiber-optic cables to LEC’s distribution poles.
West Africa The West African Power Pool (WAPP) is planning to implement larger scale fiber projects. WAPP is a cooperation of the national electricity companies in West Africa under the auspices of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The members of WAPP are working to establish a reliable power grid for the region and a common market for electricity. To date, the group has not successfully launched a specific fiber initiative.
However, there are notable failures. In South Africa, Broadband InfraCo has struggled to find success as a utility selling backbone transmission capacity, as detailed in chapter 4.3. In many cases, the lack of technical expertise and the bureaucratic obsta -
cles that must be overcome have proven terminal to the effort or to supply of sophisticated active transmission services. Arguably, in many instances, a role as provider of passive infrastructure is a more realistically beneficial aim. Indeed, there have been instances in which even fiber installation has proven challenging to some utilities, suggesting that decision makers may wish to think twice before undertaking initiatives beyond laying ducts and erecting poles—core activities of utilities.

Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 examined the attributes and performance of various business models in the deployment 
of infrastructure and trends in spectrum policy and planning, as well as cross-sector infrastructure sharing. This examination leads to a number of lessons learned and recommendations for policy makers seeking to promote broadband deployment in their respective economies. The discussion of these recommendations begins by outlining general objectives policy makers may have for expanding and upgrading infrastructure and planning for spectrum use. This is followed by a list of more general recommendations for policy making that involve the possibility of government intervention in some form, as well as specific recommendations linked to the types of infrastructure deployment and issues of spectrum policy and planning discussed in this report.7. Recommendations114
7.1. Objectives and General Considerations
There are a number of objectives that a nation may 
be pursuing for which additional infrastructure deployment may be a key driver or enabler. These objectives include:
 •Meeting existing and/or projected demand in 
areas that are currently served;
 •Bridging the digital divide  by extending service 
to areas that are currently underserved or not covered (that is, commercially unviable);
 •Promoting innovation  by stimulating the local 
ICT market and creating high-tech areas; and,
 •Achieving socioeconomic impacts  that are not 
able to be monetized by service providers.
In considering best-fit approaches to facilitating infra-structure deployment and spectrum planning to meet these objectives, experience has shown that it is im-portant to keep in mind the following considerations:
 •Is the market for which the deployment is being considered currently or potentially competitive? The existence of private players (which have gained significant market share) suggests that the market is buoyant enough to allow existing or new private network service providers to be the main actors in achieving the objectives. The absence of competition may both suggest that the market may not support solutions involving multiple actors and indicate that there are regulatory issues that may have to be addressed as part of the deployment. 
 •Is there a positive business case for the private sector to deploy or upgrade the necessary infrastructure? If the answer is yes, then it is quite likely that existing or new private network services will already be incentivized to achieve the objectives. •Does the necessary infrastructure represent missing links in existing infrastructure, an up-grade of existing infrastructure, or extension of existing infrastructure? The answer to this question will suggest which actors—incumbents or new entrants—may be involved in developing an appropriate solution, that is, a solution involv-ing upgrades of existing infrastructure will tend to involve incumbents, whereas the solutions to provide missing infrastructure may provide an opportunity to expand entry in the market. 
 •Can the regulator effectively control domi -
nant market power? The answer to this ques -
tion will determine what kind of market structure and entry solutions will have to be addressed beyond the network deployment itself.
 •Is the government regulation of the telecom-munications and adjacent markets developed and integrated enough to enable the objec-tives? This consideration seeks to understand whether the telecommunications regulator is both empowered and willing to utilize its authority to regulate the wholesale service providers in the country. The ultimate goal of the regulation is to encourage services that are carrier neutral, provided on an open-access basis and enable affordable end-user Internet. Are the various min-istries capable of synchronizing regulation (such as civil works regulation advocating for street and in-building fiber deployment) and is there a basis for shared infrastructure deployment? 
 •Is the government PPP-capable? In other words, is there an enabling environment such that the government can in some form take a partnership role in the deployment and running of the infrastructure (see table 7.1).INNO VATIVE BUSINESS MODELS FOR EXPA NDING FIBER- OPTIC NETW ORKS AND CL OSING THE ACCESS GAPS115
 •What is the government leverage to gain 
access to regional and global funds for broad -
band development? The government needs to evaluate access to funds based on its partic -
ipation in wider economic unions (such as the European Union or ASEAN) and the government’s capability to raise funds on international markets. Most of the European broadband projects (for example, Poland, Croatia, Slovenia, Romania, and Estonia) have been implemented by using structured EU funds. There are also a number of infrastructure banks acting on the global or re -
gional levels that support these initiatives, includ -
ing vendor-linked funds. With regard to private investment, U.S.-based technology ventures (such as OneWeb and Kalo) have turned to venture capital (VC) funds and big technology investors to raise the capital required for their projects.Table 7.1: Is the Government PPP-Capable?
Source: TMG/Salience Consulting.Attribute Description
Local laws and regulationsIf local statutes do not permit one or more forms of public-private partnership, the govern -
ment’s role in business models will be limited.
Previous experienceIf the public sector has not been involved in such activity before, or if it has and proved an unreliable partner, then partnership is questionable.
Financial resourcesMost public-private partnerships require a long-term financing commitment from the public sector. If the public sector lacks the resources or cannot commit resources over a long period of time, its role will be limited.
Consensus, political support, and leadershipIf a government is unstable, lacks public support, or is otherwise divided in terms of policy or willingness and ability to lead, the public sector may not be capable of committing in the manner and degree necessary.
Specialist resourcesFrom the beginning of the inception of the deployment concept to the launch and through -
out the operation, the government will need expert opinion to inform their decision making for the partnership. If such resources are not available, decision making will suffer and trust may erode. 116
7.2. General Recommendations and Principles
There are five key principles that should form the 
baseline recommendations for a consideration of any policy for promoting broadband deployment: 
 •Limited, incremental intervention.  
Governments should intervene only in cases of clear market failure and only to the extent neces -
sary to overcome market failure and complement private investment. The rapid success of private, market-driven projects such as Liquid Telecom, Ufinet, Baltic Optical Network, JADI, and RCN demonstrate the validity of these principles. The correct area classification based on service availability (such as the EU marking of black, grey, and white areas) will help the government quanti -
fy the intervention space. 
 •Minimize regulatory failure. Governments should not confuse market failure with regula-tory failure. Before a perceived market failure is addressed with intervention through direct participation in the market as an operator, inves-tor, or subsidizer, the state should first determine if it has contributed to the problems by creating barriers to beneficial entry, unduly raising costs, or being otherwise unsupportive to infrastructure deployment. The actions that governments should consider to obviate or minimize regulatory failure runs from best practice policy principles to specific regulatory measures. There are many publications covering best international regulatory practice for facilitating broadband infrastructure deployment (see, for example, Kelly and Rossotto 2012; MacMillan Keck and the Columbia Institute for Sustainable Development 2017; and GSMA 2018). The main features are summarized in box 7.1. •Consensus on a coherent vision, political will, and leadership.  Intervention should be based on 
clear policy objectives for the sector, be conduct -
ed with commitment on the part of leadership, and flow through to regulation implemented consistently with the policy objectives. These prin -
ciples are particularly linked to success or failure. The evidence of the importance of this principle is particularly strong in cases where success has been elusive. In Qatar, for example, competing policy aims undermined the admirable intentions for broadband development. 
 •Governments should take a sober view of what activity it can credibly and reliably carry out. All states will have limits as to the skill sets, finances, and legal authority, among others, available to actively participate in infrastructure deployment. Governments should assess these capabilities and craft their participation accordingly.
 •Promoting competition.  Government interven -
tion should be engineered to increase competi -
tion even when infrastructure competition is not viable, that is, service-based competition. This generally means that the government should support open-access wholesale arrangements. This recommendation finds expression in the wide variety of open-access network service providers in crossborder, national, middle-mile, and last-mile initiatives covered in this study.

Box 7.1: Policy Principles and Specific Measure to Obviate or Minimize Regulatory Failure
With respect to best policy principles, included here are regulatory predictability, transparency, cost-ben -
efit analysis, proportionality, as well as the attributes of minimal distortion (which applies, for example, to 
tax policy). 
Specific regulatory measures include: 
 •spectrum policy measures that are the subject of chapter 7.3;
 •service licensing to increase beneficial market entry of a wide variety of market players;
 •improvements to the access, including, where justified by market concentration, open access and 
other measures to safeguard competition and reduce the costs of deployment; and
 •cross-sectoral initiatives to lower the cost of network deployment, such as increased access to rights of way, less-bureaucratic permitting processes, and facilitating the sharing of infrastructure across utilities.

resources to ensure effective and efficient use that improves and expands Internet access, the following core set of spectrum principles were used to develop the recommendations set forth in chapter 7.3.
 •Leverage flexibility to enable the introduction and growth of emerging technologies, no -
tably 5G and the IoT.  Although 5G technology 
has been in development for several years and IoT devices and services are already in use, both technologies are expected to experience considerable further development and growth. Regulators and policy makers should ensure that their actions not only do not constrain such growth but, rather, facilitate and encourage it, building frameworks that maximize flexibility, enable innovation, minimize administrative burdens, and take into account the characteris -
tics that make these technologies different from earlier innovations. These new technologies will both enable novel, flexible uses of spectrum, and also benefit from regulatory flexibility in consid -
ering the rules and policies that govern their deployment.
 •Maximize spectrum access for wireless broad -
band services. Demand for wireless broadband services has continued to grow unabated, driven in part by the continuing improvement of wireless technologies and their new applications, and the increasing ability to flexibly use spectrum to serve different needs and users. Policy makers and regulators seeking to expand access to broadband should keep in mind that the most important method by which to increase capacity and improve the user experience is to ensure the availability of appropriate spectrum for use by wireless broadband services. This is even more important when considering the new connected applications supported by IoT. Identification of bands and transparency regarding the amount and availability of spectrum must be accompa -
nied by appropriate—and sufficiently flexible—licensing and access models that are aligned with the likely use cases of the spectrum under consideration. In addition, regulatory frameworks should facilitate flexible use, allowing for pooling and sharing, to maximize use and efficiency, while at the same time promoting competition.
 •Implement strategies specifically targeting unserved and underserved populations.  
Reaching areas and populations that continue to lack adequate—or any—broadband access will require new, more flexible approaches and reconsideration of the role of government. The advent of new wireless technologies with differ -
ent characteristics and use cases than existing mobile networks should prompt actions that can strengthen existing successful approaches and leverage new technologies, business models, and spectrum authorization approaches to provide governments and regulators with a flexible set of tools with which to develop new sector strategies.INNO VATIVE BUSINESS MODELS FOR EXPA NDING FIBER- OPTIC NETW ORKS AND CL OSING THE ACCESS GAPS119
7.3. Spectrum-Specific Recommendations
Set forth below are a set of recommendations for 
regulators and policy makers considering new technologies and trends in the context of spectrum policy. These recommendations focus on the follow -
ing three key policy objectives: promoting 5G and IoT deployment, supporting expected demand growth, and expanding wireless broadband to unserved and underserved areas. 
Promoting 5G and IoT deployment:  Society is 
moving towards a demand for ubiquitous connectiv -
ity, a trend which will accelerate with the expansion 
of new technologies, such as 5G and the IoT. Such technologies will also expand the possibilities for new services and applications. As they are in the early stages of development and implementation, regulators and policy makers should take steps to enable their continued deployment and availability. To achieve this objective, the following action items should be considered:
 •Review national broadband policies to consider the use of different wireless broadband tech -
nologies for the expansion of connectivity. The availability of multiple spectrum bands and new technologies provide regulators with increased flexibility to meet broadband access goals using a variety of technological tools.
 •Identify spectrum to enable the next wave of wireless broadband growth, including new mobile services, intended to enable 5G and the IoT. This includes existing spectrum identifications below 6 GHz and new spectrum ranges between 24 GHz and 86 GHz. 5G technologies, in particular, will benefit from the availability of low-band, mid-band, and high-band spectrum.
 •Ensure that the legal and regulatory framework provides maximum flexibility for spectrum users to deploy new and updated technologies, includ -ing in unlicensed spectrum. Given the high reuse potential of bands above 24 GHz, infrastructure requirements, interference management, and valuation approaches will change radically. In this regard, spectrum and infrastructure sharing initiatives could play a significant role in acceler -
ating 5G, the IoT, and smart city developments. Regulators should elaborate a more developed set of sharing regulations—addressing both infrastructure and spectrum—as well as spec -
trum assignment and valuation approaches for 5G operators.
 •Define the differing spectrum needs for various industry verticals supported by IoT applications. Spectrum and service needs will vary, as can be seen when comparing the needs of a high-pre -
cision autonomous vehicle, industrial machinery, and a low-cost energy meter.
 •Certification processes should be streamlined so as to meet requirements while avoiding delays and reducing costs for both suppliers and regulators, easing the introduction of new and emerging technologies. A simplified approach to ensuring adherence to technical standards is key to ensuring equipment compatibility, quality of service, and reduced interference while minimizing barriers to expansion of the sector. Similarly, certification fees should be reduced to levels that cover administrative costs, rather than generating revenue.
 •Establish technical criteria for the use of spectrum bands based on international recommendations and take the same considerations into account when drafting new regulations. Harmonized technical characteristics allow for economies of scale that reduce both network deployment costs and user equipment prices.120
Supporting expected demand growth:  Given the 
explosive growth in demand for wireless services, the 
ongoing development of new wireless technologies and spectrum usage paradigms, and the rise of new licensing and authorization mechanisms, regulators and policy makers should consider the following action items in order to increase the amount of spectrum that can be used to expand broadband services:
 •Assess future spectrum demand, particularly for IMT, Wi-Fi, and the IoT, to meet capacity and deployment needs, through:
 •engaging relevant stakeholders in the pro -
cess, consulting with industry on expected uses cases and spectrum needs;
 •reviewing international studies on spectrum demand for different services and bands; and
 •modeling demand, considering new or emerg-ing technologies, such as 5G and the IoT.
 •Revise the national table of frequency alloca -
tions—to the greatest extent possible—to reflect global and regional allocations in accordance with the ITU Radio Regulations, as well as identifica -
tions for IMT services (for example, 3G, 4G, and 5G). Update the table in line with the changes to the Radio Regulations that are decided at World Radiocommunication Conferences.
 •Refarm mobile broadband spectrum from pre -
vious technology generations to increase block sizes and allow use of newer technologies, taking into account regional and global developments in order to maximize harmonization opportunities.
 •Identify spectrum in use by other technologies and services that would provide greater value through use by wireless broadband technologies and services (for example, digital dividend), and then repurpose that spectrum. •Implement a flexible spectrum regulatory frame -
work that promotes and allows practices such as trading, sharing, aggregation, and lower barriers to accessing and using spectrum.
 •Implement assignment processes that maximize the social and economic benefits of spectrum use (for example, coverage, speed, quality, industrial development) rather than maximization of license revenues. Assignment approaches intended to meet service and coverage goals are more likely to result in increased broadband access than those designed to maximize revenue generation through license fees.
 •Develop a spectrum licensing schedule to assist service providers—including potential new en-trants—to make decisions regarding network and service planning. The schedule should be pub-lished online in order to allow all interested parties to have equivalent information when determining how and when to invest in spectrum licenses that will enable them to meet their objectives.
 •To achieve economies of scale for deployment, require licensees to deploy networks and infrastructure that comply with widely adopted international standards, but take caution to ensure implementation of technology-neutral regulations to avoid limiting operators’ ability to adopt new technologies.
 •Mandate spectrum license conditions that ensure efficient use of the spectrum, the potential for sharing appropriate spectrum with other services, mechanisms and rights for spectrum trading, and clear renewal provisions. Well-defined spectrum licensing regimes ensure that mechanisms are in place to allow licensees and other interested par -
ties to make the most efficient and effective use of spectrum resources. Flexibility of spectrum use conditions can help to create a positive sharing dynamic among spectrum users. Wi-Fi bands are perhaps the best example of flexible and shared use leading to an innovative environment.INNO VATIVE BUSINESS MODELS FOR EXPA NDING FIBER- OPTIC NETW ORKS AND CL OSING THE ACCESS GAPS121
 •Empower regulators to respond to inefficient 
spectrum use or other license condition breaches through remedies that maximize spectrum use and social benefit. For example, licensees making inefficient use of licensed spectrum could be compelled to pursue opportunities to trade and/or share their underutilized spectrum. In cases of severe license condition breaches, regulators should be empowered to withdraw licenses altogether.
Expanding wireless broadband to unserved and underserved areas: Expansion of wireless broad -
band to currently unserved or underserved areas, especially in conjunction with the development of newer wireless technologies, will likely require ap -
proaches and incentives different from initial mobile network deployments. To achieve these objectives, the following action items should be considered:
 •Develop a sector policy that prioritizes expan -
sion of wireless broadband services, especially in unserved/underserved areas. This policy should take into account backhaul and last-mile access, as well as access to spectrum and public infrastructure (for example, government-owned facilities, electric power), while keeping the flexibility to choose appropriate technologies and viable business models. •Promote the creation of community Internet service providers and small connectivity provid -
ers, particularly by providing access to spectrum, backhaul, and other public infrastructure, and by resolving any unfair impediments to their deployment. Community-owned companies and small providers could be allowed access to these key resources at preferential rates, which can be particularly important for business models that are often tailored to low-income populations with low levels of technology literacy. 
 •Implement a flexible framework for spectrum use by broadband providers, including multiple approaches to spectrum access (for example, unlicensed spectrum, experimental/social licens -
es, and shared spectrum) to facilitate innovation and efficient spectrum use.
 •Identify whether and how government should directly participate in the delivery of wireless broadband services jointly with the private sector, such as through PPPs.122
7.4. Infrastructure Deployment Options: Specific 
Recommendations 
The five baseline recommendations above are 
relevant to most interventions a government might consider, irrespective of sector or objective. The analysis of projects presented in chapters 4 and 5 also suggests some specific recommendations for infrastructure deployment, should a government decide that it must be involved beyond standard tools of regulation. The recommendations below are specific to infrastructure deployment where higher levels of government intervention are required: 
 •Private-sector participation. Government intervention in infrastructure deployment should include private-sector involvement wherever possible. The advantages of private-sector par-ticipation include the sharing of costs and risks, building expertise, and adding critical financial insight. The projects reviewed include numerous public-private partnerships (PPPs) where an initiative was simply not possible without private capital or benefited significantly in terms of rollout and financial viability from having private entities involved in constructing and running the network. Even where government intervention is indirect, implemented through policies such as taxation, subsidization, or regulatory obligation, the private sector impacts should be taken into consideration. 
 •In the presence of state-owned incumbents, structural changes should be considered as part of an overall national plan. If the state-owned incumbent is part of the solution, then it is quite likely that some sort of repositioning will be neces-sary. In The Gambia, for example, the state-owned operator has yet to be restructured and broadband policy is suffering as a result. The role of the state-owned incumbent, Onatel, in the Burundi Backbone System proved a major flaw. OpenNet provides examples of structural changes called for in the transition to more aggressive broadband policies.  •Utilities’ collaboration and enabling reuse.  In 
many cases, there is existing or planned utility infrastructure that telecommunications policy makers have not considered or are not aware of when developing national broadband expansion plans. State utilities have valuable assets, such as ducts and poles, buildings, land rights, and even fiber networks (such as SCADA) that could be leveraged for cost-effective deployment of the new infrastructure. The more this infrastructure is shared, the lower the cost to pass premises. In addition, joint projects are feasible—civil works initiatives that can also include parallel deploy -
ment of telecommunications networks and other utility networks. 
 •Justification should be based on realistic business case and socioeconomic cost-benefit analysis with a view to local, national, and regional trends in the future. The intervention should be undertaken with the objective of mimicking a risk-adjusted, externality-adjusted market out-come. In other words, economic net present value (ENPV) should be calculated and the initiative reconsidered or abandoned if not positive. Most, if not all, of the EU cases had to demonstrate positive ENPV before the government would commit funds to the venture. There are a number of municipal cases in the United States where overexuberance led to poor project choices, for example, iProvo and Burlington Telecom. 
 •One business model’s failure can lead to another’s success. The history of telecommu-nications infrastructure is filled with examples of overbuild, asset stranding, underutilization, and failed commercial endeavors of all sorts. While in the short run some projects may be wasteful, nevertheless, in the context of increasing long-term demand, long-lived assets can often INNO VATIVE BUSINESS MODELS FOR EXPA NDING FIBER- OPTIC NETW ORKS AND CL OSING THE ACCESS GAPS123
be repurposed, commercialized, or otherwise 
brought back into productive use and facilitate new entry for the benefit of all. This notion applies to much of the infrastructure of utilities, government-owned networks, and facilities of bankrupt public service providers. Policy makers can act to reduce the time that assets lay idle by (re)commercializing and reducing barriers to cross-sectoral engagement.
 •Finally, the history of successful business models provides a rich collection of lessons for policy 
makers seeking to intervene to deploy broad -
band in underserved areas.  This report has presented such lessons throughout. Below we provide a decision-making tool that facilitates identifying experiences that may be particularly relevant for policy makers given the attributes of the particular infrastructure challenge they face. Figure 7.1 summarizes a process to determine the proper role for the state in any particular infrastructure deployment scenario. The first step is to determine if there is an infrastructure deployment problem and, if so, its nature and scope. The second step is to identify the un -
derlying causes of any problems that are found to exist. The third step is to consider possible responses to address those problems.

Figure 7.2 provides a decision-making tool to facil -
itate selecting the appropriate role for the state to 
play. First the “null” scenario  is identified, where the 
state should reconsider any proposed intervention. Where there is no demonstrable market or regula -
tory failure to address, state action is generally not justified. There are at least three examples in the list of reviewed projects where the state may have been unnecessarily ambitious in its objectives—the second phase of Rwanda NBFON (involving the pursuit of a single wholesale mobile network for 4G), Peru RNDOFO, and South Africa’s Broadband InfraCo. In the latter two, state investment was made in national backbones in markets in which the private sector was capable of delivering infrastructure on its own. Figure 7.2 goes on to address additional scenarios to assist policy makers in identifying a potential course of action in a variety of contexts. Scenario 1 results when there is no inherent market failure, but counterproductive regulation, unnec -
essary legal constraints, or unduly burdensome financial obligations are imposed by the state. In this scenario, the state’s role is simply to eliminate or minimize the self-created cause of infrastructure inadequacy. In most cases, this amounts to improv -
ing licensing—simply authorizing the entry of new players, ensuring spectrum is available, and so on. In this regard, a recommendation to lift regulation does not imply that the state should discontinue good regulatory practice. Indeed, as market dynam -
ics often lead to concentration and vertical integra -
tion, the state should continue to monitor market developments. Successfully addressing regulatory failure in such a way as to facilitate new infrastructure in the short or medium term may lead to market failure in the form of dominance in the longer term. 
Source: TMG/Salience Consulting.124
Scenario 2 is the case of market failure primarily 
arising from dominance in the market. Here more active regulatory intervention may be required. This may take the form of more active encouragement of private-sector competitors, for example, the creation of WIOCC in the crossborder market of East Africa, mandated access of dominant player networks, or more radical solutions such as structural separation.
Before addressing other, more interventionist, roles 
that the state may play in infrastructure development, it must first answer the question of whether it is capable of taking on a role that involves the creation of missing markets or infrastructure. The vast ma -
jority of states are in some way capable of playing a constructive role; however, there are states that have severe institutional issues, or an inability to commit to required policy or provide appropriate leadership. In these cases ( Scenario 3), dealing with fundamental 
governance weaknesses must be a central part of any development program implemented. 
Consistent with the principle of promoting com -
petition, the next question that should be asked is 
whether a more active role for the state can be used to create service-based competition. Note that this refers specifically to service-based competition rather than competition in general or infrastructure-based competition. This is because if the market can support infrastructure-based competition, then the absence of such competition is a result of regulatory failure or behavior of a dominant firm and would be addressed in Scenario 1 or Scenario 2, respectively.If the market cannot even support service-based competition ( Scenario 4), then it is probably very 
thin. These cases tend to be remote local markets. There are a number of innovative technologies and business models discussed in this report that ad -
dress these particular circumstances. 
27 For a list and review of these documents, see Aizawa 2018.Scenarios 5, 6 and 7 address state action that is progressively more interventionist. In each case, the state’s financial commitments should be justified on the basis of a robust cost-benefit analysis, which forecasts an economic net present value (ENPV) for the project or initiative that is not negative. ENPV is a calculation that includes the socioeconomic benefits of the project (see box 7.2 for further details). 
Scenario 5 is the case where the state can limit its in -
tervention to subsidy, preferential financing, or sales 
commitments, which offset low or uncertain nonstate revenues. In this case, the state avoids management or ownership of the entity undertaking the project. Ideally, incentives would be competed for through an appropriately structured tender process.
Scenario 6 represents those cases in which the 
subsidy required to interest the private sector in taking up the opportunity is too high for the state to afford. In these cases, the state must take on more of the project risk in order to attract the private sector. As discussed in chapter 2, there are a number of public-partnership forms in which the state cedes (increasing degrees of) management control to a private contractor: contracting, leasing, concessions, and SPVs. Various development organizations have provided guidance on how to decide which of these PPPs would be preferred (based on a combination of expertise and risk-sharing requirements) and how they should be structured.
27
Regarding Scenario 7, it is recommended that it is limited to those instances in which the state cannot build a sufficiently attractive offer of financial incen -
tives and risk-sharing to interest the private sector. This represents a small set of cases. Of the projects reviewed in this report, arguably, only the Tonga submarine cable meets this criterion. However, there are other pure state-play examples in our review that have enjoyed success. The first is Oman Broadband Company, which operates in a region of the world INNO VATIVE BUSINESS MODELS FOR EXPA NDING FIBER- OPTIC NETW ORKS AND CL OSING THE ACCESS GAPS125
where state ownership is still the default approach 
to infrastructure. Another pure state-play example is Lithuania RAIN. However, Oman Broadband and Lithuania RAIN are likely to be the exceptions that prove the rule. Both examples involve circumstances that are unlikely to be replicable in many developing nations.
Box 7.2: Importance of the Calculation of Socioeconomic Benefits
It has been demonstrated that broadband infrastructure deployment contributes to the wider economy. 
These impacts arise from:
 •Increased GDP and employment, resulting from the broadband infrastructure investment itself and 
indirect and induced effects of investment, as well as the cost reduction and innovation enabled by increased penetration and speed.
 •Increased productivity and innovation, resulting from faster communications, ability to deal with larger amounts of digital content, time savings, and the new forms of organizing business and social activities and new forms of sales.
 •Improved general welfare, resulting from increased income borne of higher productivity, increase in the spread of knowledge, increased e-learning opportunities, the expansion of health services through e-health, and improved government service delivery through e-government. 
 •Increased consumer benefits, resulting from the expansion of new types of computer applications, network services, increased media content and quality online, increased quality of remote communi -
cations, and time saving innovations of shopping online.
 •Positive environmental effects of reducing daily commuting and business traveling and the reduction in the need for paper consumption. 
 •Without consideration of these impacts, that is, only considering the financial rationale of the project, value creation will be underestimated and the project not undertaken or underfunded.
 •There are a number of ways that these benefits can be taken into account to determine whether there is a net economic benefit of investing in a given project. In one approach, the revenue line for the business case is effectively replaced by quantified socioeconomic benefits. Ideally, an ENPV calculation would also modify business case costs to reflect social opportunity cost of inputs rather than those based on observed prices.  
For a fuller discussion, see, for example, European Commission 2014.
Finally, if the project is not ENPV positive for the state to take on, then it is almost certainly not a project worth undertaking. Note that an overly sanguine business case—one that generates a positive ENPV when reason suggests it should be negative—will lead to the null scenario, that is, an overzealous inter -
vention by the state in infrastructure deployment.126

7.5. World Bank Group Lessons Learned 
Since 2007, the World Bank Group (WBG) has allocat -
ed more than $1.2 billion in broadband connectivity 
infrastructure financing with a focus on projects for submarine cables and terrestrial backbone networks and for regional integration in the South Pacific, the Caribbean, and in East, Central, and West Africa re -
gions. In 2018, a new regional connectivity program was approved to improve connectivity in landlocked countries in Central Asia and parts of South Asia. Financing of investments in connectivity infrastruc -
ture have been complemented by technical assis -
tance on policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms with the aim of assisting governments to become more effective in the fast-moving ICT sector, where traditional telecom infrastructure, services, devices, and content are converging toward a single platform. In almost every case, the development objective was to enhance economic growth by contributing to lowering the price of broadband capacity and extending the reach of backbone networks, and in every case a set of commitments was required before financing was made available to the participating government. Such commitments typically included sector liberalization, open and nondiscriminatory access to communications infrastructure, and public -private partnerships (PPPs) to own and/or manage the investments.
Rapid evolvement of the sector meant that WBG 
support also needed to evolve quickly from the tra -
ditional approach of public financing. A range of PPP approaches were implemented across the globe both regionally and at the national levels and were adopt -
ed depending on the country contexts. These include cases that were reviewed in this report, such as the Central African Backbone (CAB), the Eastern Africa Submarine Cable System (EASSy), the African Coast to Europe submarine communications cable (ACE), SimbaNET in Malawi, the Burundi Broadband System (BBS) and the Tonga subsea cable. As a result, several lessons for the WBG have emerged, in particular:  •A constructive, trusting, and cooperative relationship between the public and private sector is important for successful devel -
opment of the broadband market.  In the 
case of Malawi, while the implementation was done under a private design, build and operate (DBO) model, the bulk capacity purchase by the government helped stimulate investment by the private sector through the aggregation of demand (see chapter 4.3). On the other hand, the role of the state-owned incumbent, Onatel, in the Burundi Backbone System proved a major flaw. A transparent governance structure is required to enable appropriate levels of risk sharing between public and private partners.
 •Investors will likely have different incentives, requiring extensive upfront consultations and legal/transactional support.  Technical 
assistance to support implementation of project activities can play an important role in areas new to the government. Significant capacity is needed for negotiating with the private sector and estab -
lishing the new business models. For example, the EASSy suffered from setup issues that are typical in a large consortium (see box 4.1). It is important to ensure that the final institutional model adequately addresses the expectations of different players.
 •Legal and regulatory reforms must go hand-in-hand with infrastructure investments.  
Country commitment is a key success factor that requires continuous government support for the reforms or the outcomes may be diminished. The legal and regulatory environment needs to support open access to capacity on international connectivity and wholesale pricing needs to be cost based, nondiscriminatory, and transparent. When new business models are created or new services offered, a new licensing regime may be 128
necessary which, in turn, may require new policies 
and legislation. For example, significant technical assistance was provided in Liberia under the West Africa Regional Communications Infrastructure Program (WARCIP) to ensure appropriate regula-tory reforms took place prior to the implementa-tion of the ACE cable landing station.
Close coordination between the World Bank and the IFC have also proven to be effective. For instance, in the implementation of the Red Compartida in Mexico, the IFC and IFC Asset Management Company committed $205 million in equity to the winning financial consortium (Morgan Stanley Infrastructure, Megacable, Axtel and pension funds), while the World Bank provided technical assistance for carrying out analysis on regulatory and technical aspects of the concession, including quality and coverage. On the other hand, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency’s (MIGA) investment guarantees in the ICT sector have, to date, focused on the mobile market, most significantly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Nonetheless, political risk insurance issued by MIGA has significantly contributed to improving mobile coverage and services, supporting rapid expansion of mobile broadband. The WBG continues to seek ways to improve coordination to maximize its support to client countries and offer innovative solutions for extending broadband infrastructures and services.

Baltic Optical Network
Alliance of service providers based on telecom infrastructure of power 
companies
URL: http://www.datalogistics.lt/en/node/90
The Baltic Optical Network (BON) was established in 2002 through linking the telecommunications networks of power utilities in the three Baltic states of Estonia (Televõrgu), Latvia (Latvenergo) and Lithuania (Data Logistics Center, part of Lietuvos Energija). BON is an alliance rather than a commercial entity. 
BON has found a market opportunity to offer services to customers across borders to better compete against traditional telecoms players. BON provides 
transmission capacity speeds of up to 10 Gbps between the main nodal points of telecommunications in the region and in the transit running through the region. 
BON coverage of over 8 km of fiber extends to practically any city or town of the Baltic states. BON has joined the For Connecting Europe alliance (4cE) 
aimed at providing modern and high quality telecommunication services in Europe. 
In 2017, Telia Lietuva bought the Lithuania partner, Data Logistics Center.

Central African Backbone – CAB(1)
Regional PPP fails to gain acceptance
URL: N/A
The Central Africa Backbone represents an example of the type of venture, in which the World Bank attempted to construct cross-border fiber connection 
through the poorest of countries. It runs from Chad to the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
The CAB structure called for the establishment of new regional telecom operator(s) for reselling international, regional, and national capacity to existing 
national operators and service providers at discounted rates and for a regional Public-Private Partnership (PPP) entity to invest in and manage the CAB infrastructure.
In CAB(1), Chad, Cameroon and the Central African Republic (CAR) were to create a PPP to build backbone cross-border links and manage the CAB 
infrastructure.
Because of the reluctance of their incumbents to relinquish sole control over their international gateways, both Cameroon and Chad took actions that 
would eventually lead to the cancellation of CAB1B in 2012.
 •Not all nations are capable of engaging in a PPP and coordinating among different developing nations to create a regional PPP may overcomplicate the task 
 •Working with each country separately at its own pace may be a more effective strategy
 •Adopting a less complex PPP model that uses approaches such as advance capacity purchases and demand stimulation may also help in simplifying implementation
 •In additional to political crisis in CAR, generic economy issues in Chad and Cameroon, the political strength of the incumbent may undermine an initiativeAttributes Success CriteriaNarrative

EASSy
Submarine cable system in East Africa
URL: http://www.eassy.org/
Conceived in 2003, the Eastern Africa Submarine System (EASSy), is a submarine cable system linking Sudan to South Africa, via most Eastern African 
countries: Sudan, Djibouti, Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, Comoros, Mozambique, Madagascar and South Africa.
From inception, EASSy was structured as a consortium of public and private operators, though mostly run by private institutions.Designed by Alcatel-Lucent, the system runs 10,000 km of route, landing at nine different stations, and comprises two fiber pairs configured as a flat ring 
for higher resilience. Like most subsea cables, EASSy uses DWDM technology, transmitting SDH frames. The flat ring architecture, also referred to as a collapse ring, enables full protection of the system in case of rupture of one branch or any termination card or equipment at the landing station.
 •EASSy’s consortium members are all operators of terrestrial cables, and/or members of other subsea consortia, providing extensive onward connectiv -
ity, around and throughout Africa, and towards Europe and Middle East
 •Sister lending program to connect landlocked countries in East Africa
 •Deployed in an underserved “grey” area for subsea cable market

The West Africa Regional Communications Infrastructure Program (WARCIP) assisted with the financing of the West Africa portion of the approximately 
17,000 km ACE submarine cable system connecting 23 countries from South Africa to Europe, including the landing station in Liberia.
As in a number of other West African countries (e.g., The Gambia, São Tomé and Príncipe), the World Bank help create a special purpose vehicle on a 
PPP basis to manage the landing station on an open access basis.
Cable Consortium of Liberia (CCL) was launched in 2013 and owned jointly by the Government of Liberia (55%), Libtelco (20%) and the three mobile 
network operators (MNOs): Lonestar (10%), Cellcom (10%) and Novafone (5%).

Liquid Telecom 
Private sector fiber optical network infrastructure breaking 
cross-border bottlenecks
URL: https://www.liquidtelecom.com/
Started as Econet Satellite service operating in Zimbabwe for its first 10 years. International expansion triggered by need to access subsea capacity: created a fiber network to South Africa. In 2004 it rebranded as Liquid Telecom and has since searched for growth mainly through acquisition. 
Acquisition of Neotel in South Africa in 2016 doubled network size. Originally a wholesale-only play has recently been expanding into the retail space. 
Now may be the largest pan-African fiber network.
Liquid Telecom extended most of its reach through acquisition (Zimbabwe, Kenya (KDN), Zambia, Rwanda (Rwandatel), Uganda, etc.) but also creates

Launched in 2010, MainOne’s current cable system is a 7,000 km submarine cable with landing stations in Nigeria, Ghana and Portugal. 
MainOne began as a comparatively small operation providing connectivity for service providers in Ghana and Nigeria. It has compensated for this small 
scale by implementing a number of prudent business model attributes. 
For example, it has largely outsourced significant parts of its deployment to specialized partners and found preferential funding through the Pan-African 
Infrastructure Development Fund. Furthermore, it has gained scale by pursuing a different segment strategy: providing metro fiber and services in Nigeria and Ghana as well as datacenter, cloud and managed security services.

BBS was established as a PPP to finance, build and operate a national backbone network with international connectivity. All major network operators 
were included in the corporate structure of the PPP entity. 
BBS operated networks open to all service operators and intended for public services, businesses and individuals. It partnered with government institu -
tions in the framework of the “Government Communication” network (COMGOV), universities, banks. It also constructed virtual landing station and IXP. It was designed to be complementary to the construction of the East African Submarine Cable System (EASSy). Originally intended to build out network 
from 2007 to 2011, negotiation difficulties extended the build out period with most of the capacity installed over 2012-2014. BBS became commercially operational in 2013. BBS financial basis proved too weak. Some of the private operators failed to contribute the funds they had promised and others, like Africell, effectively exited the market. ONATEL faced bankruptcy, following a failed privatization process. It also faces severe competitive pressure with the market entry of Lumitel in 2014. The government in January 2017 revoked the BBS PPP status and took it into government ownership.
 •There is a tradeoff to the PPP design between (i) a collaborative approach and a complex design with major benefits (efficient leverage of public funds), and (ii) a simplified approach and design with more limited benefits but lower implementation risks (for instance, the outsourcing of the management of the network)
 •Once established, the JV benefited from private sector participation in terms of management, expertise, efficiency, etc 
 •Minimized duplication of network
 •As operators are by definition competing and as such do not want to be in a level playing field, their incentives to work together for success may be low

State of Gabon built the national backbone, which was financed by the World Bank in 2012.
Private network operator (Axione) – a member of the French Bouygues group, which has significant telecom and other infrastructure assets in Europe – 
won an international tender to ensure professional commercialization of the 1,000 km+ fiber optic network, providing regional and international capacity and linking provincial capitals. 
Significantly, this is not a long-term concession, but rather the operating contract is for a medium term of seven years. Support is ongoing, and the 
government of Gabon continues its involvement in the financing by covering CAPEX, while the network operator covers only OPEX. As of 2017, the oper -
ation of the landing station is successful, but the backbone linking over 20 cities and villages is still in test phase. Services offered will include backbone transport, dark fiber leases, co-location, and transit services to mobile operators and ISPs, provided on an open access basis.

The Gambian national fiber optic network component of the Regional Backbone Infrastructure and eGovernance Platform Program of the Economic 
Community of West African States (“ECOWAN”) was funded in 2010. It is a government support build-out carried out by the state-owned vertically integrated incumbent Gamtel. ECOWAN implemented by state-owned enterprise Gamtel; no private sector representation.
After completion of the network construction, the operation of the network remained in Gamtel’s hands. Beyond its deteriorating financial health (Gamtel 
has been struggling financially for some years now), Gamtel has arguably been proven organizationally incapable of delivering low cost, reliable and non-discriminatory backbone transmission services. Due to high prices and low service quality, some operators are continuing to rely on or even moving back to usage of their microwave networks instead of the ECOWAN. The ECOWAN, which should bring the capacity from ACE submarine landing station across the country, is therefore highly underutilized. 
 •Role of SOE and government’s objectives for SOE can be detrimental and in the long-term counterproductive
 •Project prioritized salvaging Gamtel business, rather than sector’s overall health

Peru RNDFO
Peru’s north-to-south national backbone (RNDFO)
URL: http://www.mtc.gob.pe/version_ingles/backbone/index.html
In 2014, the government of Peru awarded a concession to design, build, and operate a north-to-south national backbone (RDNFO) to Azteca totaling 
13,500 km of fiber. A year later, the government began issuing a number of regional and access network concessions to complement the RDNFO. To date, the government has issued 15 out of the 21 projected regional concessions, totaling around additional 19,500 km of fiber. These concessions were to offer wholesale open access services to mobile operators and ISPs. 
However, at the same time, mobile operators were building out their own national backbone networks, as might be expected in avibrant Latin American 
market like Peru. For example, Viettel, the fourth entrant into the mobile market which launched services in 2014, had deployed over 21,000 km of fiber by 2017. Claro and Telefonica have also aggressively expanded their networks. 
The result: a crash in prices for network service and a highly underutilized network. 
 •In theory, best practice PPP was followed with the private sector providing a DBO role to create carrier-neutral capacity
 •Inaccurate assessment of national backbone market conditions at design stage and the deployment of backbone capacity by private providers have 
impacted expected demand for RDNFO capacity
 •This suggests that policy could have benefited from an incremental approach to wait and see if the private sector would solve the problem on its own 
 •Long administrative processes to reassess conditions imposed on RDNFO in light of changing market conditions may undermine long term viability of the business caseAttributes Success CriteriaNarrative

The Philippines is one of the few developing countries in the world with competing national fiber-backbone infrastructure: PLDT’s Domestic Fiber Optic 
Network (DFON) and Globe Telecom’s Fiber Optic Backbone Network (FOBN) and the National Grid Corporation of the Philippine’s (NGCP) national private telecommunication network. 
The government’s priority is therefore focused at the middle and last mile level. However, it is therefore considering how to best facilitate these backbone 
networks to support programs to roll-out middle and last mile networks in unserved and underserved areas. This includes 1) identifying areas that are yet to be served with the domestic backbone routes but will eventually serve as the primary nodes for serving under-served areas and 2) linking the national backbones to avoid the need to duplicate network roll-out to these challenging areas. 
The country’s plan for selecting business models for these areas reflect good practice.

Rwanda NBFON
High-capacity national optic fiber backbone in Rwanda
URL: https://www.ktrn.rw
As part of its National Information Communication Infrastructure plan for 2005-2010, Rwanda set out to deploy a high-capacity national optic fiber 
backbone throughout the country. 
It did so by contracting Korea Telecom to supply a network comprising 2,300 km of fiber to link 317 institutions (97 in Kigali and 220 outside the capital) 
across all 30 districts of the country, as well as connecting at all nine of Rwanda’s borders. 
KT Rwanda Networks also has been granted a monopoly on 4G LTE wholesale in the country and has been increasing its presence in retail markets. 
Not surprisingly there have been complaints, however, that KT Rwanda Networks is not acting as the carrier neutral entity it was set up to be and its 4G monopoly is unjustified. 
Local Rwandan mobile operators are favoring the upgrade of their own 3.75G networks rather than use KT’s monopoly 4G network.

The 4Afrika project was launched by Microsoft in 2013, with the stated aims of assisting in the development of affordable access, skills and innovation on 
the African continent. 
As part of the 4Afrika initiative Microsoft has launched 15 TV white space (TVWS) connectivity pilots across many countries in Africa, including Kenya, 
South Africa, Namibia, Tanzania and Ghana.
The project has spurred several other programs including a telemedicine service, diagnosis applications, and more around government participation 
and agriculture. 
Ultimately, as a business model, traditional financial self-sustainability of these initiatives may not possible. Main regulatory issue is about spectrum: regulators may be hesitant to allow TVWS for commercial use as there are questions about whether this is the 
most appropriate way to use spectrum.
 •The model allows for simplified delivery in which community inhabitants have the capability to deploy and maintain facilities, software and hardware with minimal training
 •The major advantage of this type of technology is that the frequencies used, in the range of 450 to 800 MHz, allow non-line-of-sight transmission (NLOS), with low power, over relatively long distances, typically 15 km. This spectrum provides deep coverage for long-distant Internet connectivity to under-served communities over hills and through foliage 
 •May be a risky deployment: 1) given the secondary status of such TVWS use, in some cases there no guarantee of protection or availability exists if licensed TV stations decide to use this spectrum to broadcast their programming; and 2) regulatory status of spectrum may changeAttributes Success CriteriaNarrative

The project sought to demonstrate the viability of deploying high altitude platform stations to bridge the “backhaul gap” and provide connectivity to base stations and other access points serving suburban and rural communities. Once backhaul connectivity was delivered to the base station or access point, last-mile connectivity to the end user would then be offered by a mobile provider and/or wireless ISP using licensed or unlicensed spectrum. 
Each drone was designed to remain airborne for 90 days using solar power during the day and stored battery power at night and cover a radius of 
around 50 kilometers. 
In June 2018, Facebook announced that it was no longer designing and building aircraft for project Aquila, and that it would instead focus on working 
with other companies developing high-altitude platform station technologies. These include Airbus, Softbank, and Lockheed Martin, among others, which are entering the high altitude platform stations space and advancing different types of business models to support backhaul connectivity to expand Internet access.
 •The objective was to develop technology and prove viability of high altitude platform stations as a solution to bridge backhaul gaps limiting extension of broadband services.
 •Since the launch of Aquila a diverse group of players have entered the arena for high altitude platform stations, including technology providers, aerospace companies, and satellite companies, among others, which could lead to attractive business cases and models in the future.Attributes Success CriteriaNarrative

Australia NBN
Providing superfast broadband to all Australians
URL: https://www.nbnco.com.au/
Created in 2009 the NBN, together with phone and Internet providers is intended to establish Australia as a more connected, more competitive and 
more innovative nation. 
The Government’s Statement of Expectations asserts that NBN is to provide wholesale download speeds of at least 25 Mbps to all premises, and at 
least 50 Mbps speeds to 90 per cent of premises.
Over three million households and businesses are currently connected to the NBN, which is available to more than 6.1 million premises and is due for 
completion in 2020.
Involved the highly controversial creation of a massive state-owned and managed entity. The incumbent privately run fixed network operator, Telstra, 
was not required to separate retail and wholesale operations, or transfer assets to the NBN. Instead it agreed to become a reseller of NBN services and lease dark fiber, exchange space and ducts to the NBN.

Initiative to roll out high-throughput satellite service to rural communities in Africa. The business model benefits from an initial contribution from the 
European Space Agency and links communities, service providers and private and/or public partners to ensure on-going affordability through subsidy. 
The project was launched in 2016 as a response to the fact that most African governments have limited budget or resources to deliver broadband to the 
population.
ECO delivers a robust and high performing Wi-Fi hotspot service to end users at low prices. The ECO App enables users to buy and trade broadband 
credits so that everyone can use the Wi-Fi services.
ECO has been successfully piloted in several projects and is now ready for scale. 
 •Low cost power through solar cells
 •Easy-to-use ECO app and purchase broadband ECO credits to connect to the Avanti Community Wi-Fi hotspot
 •Carrier class Wi-Fi to connect a school and users in the surrounding community to the Internet

Burlington Telecom 
An example of how revenue-bonds can be used to finance rural 
broadband
URL: https://www.nbnco.com.au/
Burlington Telecom (BT) is a local fixed municipal network offering television, telephone and internet services. The company runs its communications offerings on a citywide fiber-optic network. It is a 100% municipality-owned fiber optic network. 
BT built a modified “homerun” fiber network, which meant less shared capacity among customers. Launched in 2001, Burlington Telecom was initially portrayed as a model for municipality fixed network development. While ostensibly cash-flow 
positive, BT was drawing on state funds to cover an increasing debt service and capex. By 2010, the firm was basically insolvent.
The network was privatized in 2017 through competitive bidding. Burlington Telecom was acquired by Schurz Communications for $30.8 million.
 •Being a third entrant in the local fixed network market can prove a challenge to a business case, particularly when incumbents have deep pockets
 •As a small organization, BT found it more costly to contract for content services, paid more per Mbps for transit services
 •Early mover in fiber. Ten years ago consumers less likely to value superfast broadband to pay the premium that would have kept BT afloat
 •There is evidence that BT was run too much like a civil service, rather than a commercial enterprise
 •Although a business failure as a municipal network, BT had a positive competitive impact on the market and was reborn on a sounder financial basis

Chorus
Ultra Fast Broadband (UFB) network deployment in New Zealand
URL: https://www.chorus.co.nz/
The new Telecommunications Act of New Zealand was approved in 2001 which provided the legal basis for the structural separation of Telecom New 
Zealand. Faced with the threat of such an action, Telecom New Zealand voluntarily split itself into the retail (Spark) and wholesale infrastructure (Chorus), which was finalized in 2011.
The government planned investment of $NZ1.5bn for Ultra Fast Broadband (UFB) network deployment. Crown Fibre Holdings (CFH) was established to 
manage the government’s investment. Local wholesale open access concessions were offered by tender to build fibre infrastructure meeting the goals of the UFB strategy. Chorus was awarded 24 of the 33 candidate areas for deployment. The deployment prioritized schools, hospitals, health service providers and businesses. 
The wholesale prices are determined by the Commerce Commission. In December 2015 the Commission announced its final decisions on the wholesale 
prices Chorus could charge Internet providers for its broadband services over local lines. 
 •Structural separation forged two new businesses, which have performed better for shareholders and New Zealand structural separation fundamen -

It is exploiting Motorized Earth Station Antennas (MESAs) to track inclined orbit satellites for providing access in rural areas. The earth stations are 
solar-powered near a community site, e.g., a post-office and school, where content and applications are cached. Connectivity can then be extended via point-to-point or point-to-multipoint connectivity.
Concero provides a set of e-services over the system, which are free to users or available for minimal subscription fee. Concero’s financial ambition 
is to recover the costs of the operation (terrestrial system and satellite connectivity) through share of revenues paid for financial transactions (money transfers) of subscriber. 
Capex, debt service and other non-operations expense are to be covered by donation.
 •Business model is “opportunistic” in the sense that revenue and funding depends on the sponsors and community involved

to increase as regulation relaxes. The tether carries power and connectivity to the drone which is equipped with a 4G LTE antennae. Each device can hover at up to 1000 ft and provide a coverage area of around half a square mile and can be linked to other drones as repeaters to provide larger coverage footprints.
To date the Cyphy PARC drones have been used in military applications including reconnaissance and providing secure communications. The commercial 
telecommunications applications of the technology are being explored now and are being built using the technology to provide coverage or capacity for short periods of time – a few hours to a few days.

Endaga is not a service provider per se, but rather supplies equipment to enable the roll out of service provision in communities cut off from cellular 
connectivity, road and grid access. Endaga was launched out of University of California at Berkeley’s Technology and Infrastructure for Emerging Regions research group in 2014. The group built a micro-station, a small box (called CCN1 – named for “community cellular network.”), which could be attached to a tree or structure in a remote village. 
The box uses OpenBTS, an open-source application that substitutes Internet Protocol and a software radio for telecom cellular protocols and hardware. 
CCN1 communicates with cell phones in the field using standard cell stacks and frequencies, it converts the signals to Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). 
The service provider must arrange for backhaul via a satellite link or long-distance Wi-Fi. The box runs on dedicated 2G frequencies to provide coverage in the surrounding area.
 •Endaga solution is well suited for unserved areas or disaster hit zones and any other environment that requires quick and easy coverage set-up 
 •Frequencies used are often already allocated to other service providers, thus making Endaga in theory an illegal service

EstWin is a fiber Middle Mile project established in Estonia in 2009 with the aim of reaching rural communities that were marked as “white areas” under EU broadband availability categorization. These are rural areas where there was no optical network available at the time of the evaluation nor the network was to be available in foreseeable future based on normal commercial investment terms by the local operators. The network aims to bring fiber within 1.5 km distance to 98% of all residential buildings, companies, and public authorities. 
The project is run by a consortium of private companies the Estonian Broadband Development Foundation (ELASA) on whose board sits a representative 
of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications. The founding members of ELASA are Elion, Elisa, Eltel, EMT, Ericsson, Levira, Televõrgu and Tele2 – representing the biggest telecom operators in the country. EstWin is funded inter alia from European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF).EstWin is a non-profit organization with transparent and published financial information, providing equal access to its passive fiber infrastructure to all licensed service providers. 
ELASA was criticized by the Competition Authority for skewing development in a manner favorable to existing service provider networks.

Fairwaves
Open-source solution for mobile operators in low-income areas 
URL: https://fairwaves.co/
Fairwaves was founded in 2011. It manufactures and provides equipment required to build mobile networks. The equipment to build all the functions 
of a mobile network are integrated into a single, self-contained cellular base station powered from off-grid energy sources such as solar. Scaling and integration with operator networks is made possible via local and cloud-based UmCORE servers.
The solution is tailored mainly for small mobile operators in low-income areas. Fairwaves claims that their solution requires 5-times less investment than 
building a traditional mobile network in addition to shorter deployment time. 
The Fairwaves approach significantly reduces the financial and technical barriers to deploying cellular networks, while ensuring that during their 
operation backhaul costs are minimized thanks to local call routing and use of effective voice compression algorithms.
Fairwaves claims to provide everything needed to build a mobile network which would be profitable even at $2/month revenue per user and that it can 
scale to a national network. 
 •Technology is still in something of a pilot stage, not clear how successful it will be
 •Technology provided by telecom vendors such as Fairwaves can significantly reduce the network build-out costs for mobile operators

Axione Limousin 
Broadband connectivity for the Limousin Region in France
URL: http://www.axione-limousin.fr
The Limousin is a very rural region of France, where the search for adequate broadband connectivity began as early as 1996. Not content with the 
options available from the incumbent or new entrants, the regional authorities ultimately formed a public consortium called DORSAL to define the scope and scale of the deployment, secure the appropriate financing and arrange for overall project management for deployment. 
In a first phase, after securing €204 million in financing, a 24- year concession was awarded by competitive tender to a local ICT company called Axione 
Limousin in 2005. Through this concession, Axione was mandated to design, build and operate a broadband core and middle mile wholesale network, available to all French service providers on a non-discriminatory basis. This deployment was referred to as the first-generation network.
In parallel, another consortium, the SPL Aquitaine, was created and given the mandate to design and build public fiber access networks, which were 
then transferred through concession to Axione, to commercialize and operate. This was then referred to as the second-generation network. One key success factor of the project was the harmonization between the first and second-generation networks.
The region has also encouraged private investment and allows service providers to deploy their own infrastructure in the most populated areas of the 
region. 
 •Smooth harmonization between the implementation of “first-generation” and “second-generation” network was key to the project’s success
 •Offering wholesale broadband network on “non-discriminatory” basis to all ISPs increases competition and provides better pricing for customers
 •Leveraging state and regional funds was crucial in securing financing for CAPEX of the backhaul
 •More creative revenue generation must be undertaken: may include: down payments, predominant government contracting and subsidyAttributes Success CriteriaNarrative

Länder projects, Germany
Federal program financing “profitability” and “investment” gaps 
URL: N/A
In 2008 Germany initiated its first broadband subsidy schemes to foster the provision of broadband services in underserved areas.
Universal service-type subsidy scheme implemented by the Federal Government of Germany and distributed to the Länder (States) and municipalities. Funding was directed at developing wholesale open access networks delivering at minimum 1 Mbps service to premises. Limited total amount per project to half a million euros, but could be complemented with EU funds.Allocation process was as follows: 1) municipality drafts tender describing the network required; and 2) selection among bids specifying “profitability 
gap” to be met by subsidy.
Operators are not restricted to wholesale only play, but if not, must offer terms to competitors to allow them to replicate retail offers.In subsequent years more funding was added to such subsidy schemes and the speed requirements were raised. 
 •Most effectively administered through competitive tender or as fixed figure. Ongoing subsidy may incentivize sub-optimal behavior
 •Government financing can incentivize private operators to deploy services in rural areas if “profitability” or “investment” gaps are covered
 •Program has been a boon to cross-sectoral infrastructure sharing. The number of municipal utilities (Stadtwerke) and of their spin-off subsidiary 
companies, that provide telecommunications services is reported to have grown steadily over the last several years, either solely as wholesale facilities and service providers to telecoms service providers or as vertically integrated retail service providers.Attributes Success CriteriaNarrative

URL: https://fiber.google.com/cities/provo/
iProvo was set up in 2004 as a fiber optic network under the administration of the Telecommunications Division of Provo City’s Energy Department. 
Funded by a bond issue of $39.5million, the wholesale FTTH network was planned to be completed by 2006 and cash flow positive by 2008. 
It has struggle to meet its financial objectives. In the first year it attracted only one retail partner, HomeNet Communications, which was not able to 
attract enough customers and went bankrupt. Other retail partners were not able to offer sizable discounts over competitors.
Although largely completed on time, in 2006 and 2007, iProvo was still posting losses and requiring loans from the city.In 2008, Provo sold the network to Broadweave Networks, for $40 million. Broadweave was then acquired by Veracity Networks who ended up pulling 
out of the deal.
In 2014 it was announced that iProvo was being sold to Google for a dollar. At the same time, the city of Provo still oweds the debt for a $39 million bond 
that was used to funding iProvo’s construction.

in low income communities across South Africa. 
Isizwe works with municipalities, who pay a set fee for the service for a fixed period of time, including all bandwidth and maintenance. The municipalities 
also provide mounting assets, power, and backhaul for the deployments. Project Isizwe’s non-profit structure helps keep costs down given that there is no markup in the price of services. Isizwe also works to utilize local installers and ensure that maintenance is performed with local workers. 
Project Isizwe has partnered with telecommunications company Hero Telecoms to provide the hardware, installation, support and maintenance for all 
sites at prices lower than retail, and Neotel has provided additional bandwidth at no cost as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility program.

Kalo is a satellite broadband data service announced in early 2017 as a collaboration between Kymeta antenna venture and the satellite operator Intelsat. 
Kalo’s service is tailored for moving objects such as cars and boats due to its innovative antenna design that allows high speed satellite communications on the move.
The company has received a total investment of nearly $260 million across five disclosed funding rounds with $73.5 million announced in 2017 and $62 
million announced in 2016. Investors are high profile private funds including Bill Gates, Lux Capital and Liberty Global. 
The service is marketed as bringing connectivity to buses, trains, ships, mobile emergency-response teams, remote construction sites and rural areas. 
The company takes advantage of metamaterials, specially constructed electronic matrices that can bend electromagnetic waves to pick up satellite signals coming from any direction. In addition the mTenna technology uses software to electronically point and steer toward a satellite; this means the terminal will auto-commission and auto-provision, allowing for rapid setup and installation.
 •Business model still somewhat of a work-in-progress
 •Current products are more aimed at the vertical sectors and not affordable for a typical rural direct-to-household broadband connectivity.  A possibility is to use this as a backhaul solution combined with Wi-Fi or other wireless downstream connectivity

satellite constellation providing a global, enterprise grade, high-speed and secure data network.
LeoSat is currently working with Thales Alenia Space to manufacture and launch a constellation of up to 108 Ka-band communications satellites. The 
high-throughput satellites (HTS) will be interconnected through laser links, effectively creating an optical backbone in space which is about 1.5 times faster than terrestrial fiber backbones. Once operational, the constellation will provide a highly secure communications infrastructure for business operations in the telecom backhaul, energy, maritime, government and international business markets. 
It plans to provide wholesale services to regional service providers that have large installed base in large geographic areas and services companies 
specialized in certain markets.
The total estimated cost of the project is $3.5 to $3.6 billion. So far LeoSat has undergone a few investment rounds, however the total funding is un-
known. LeoSat aims to start operations in 2019, claiming to be the first commercially available project of such scope, with full worldwide service by 2021.

The Microsoft Airband Initiative was launched in 2017 as a partnership-based program that aims to connect rural areas in the United States and around the world, focusing mostly on the use of TV white spaces. The project involves both commercial partnerships and grants to early-stage Internet access and energy access start-ups. 
Microsoft’s strategy involves investing upfront capital needed for projects to expand broadband coverage, and then seeking a revenue share from oper -
ators to recoup the investment. The initiative also involves digital skills training and technology licensing; Microsoft aims to stimulate market investments 
to reach underserved communities through royalty free access to patents and source code to help enable connectivity in rural areas. 
Microsoft does note that ultimately a mix of technologies will offer the most cost effective solutions for connecting rural populations around the world, 
however, the Airband Initiative focuses on the use of TV white spaces (TVWS), which Microsoft identifies as the best approach for reaching the majority of underserved populations in the United States. 
Microsoft is working to preserve this spectrum for rural applications.
 •Low cost technology and low-levels of subsidy can bring service to underserved communities
 •Success dependent on resolution of spectrum controversy surrounding proposals to re-farm TVWS spectrum in view of:

O3b Networks
Middle-earth-orbit satellite service for operators in remote and 
low-income areas
URL: https://www.ses.com/networks/
O3b (short for “Other 3 Billion”) was set up in 2007 as a satellite constellation project that aims to provide Internet access to remote and low-income areas.
The technology is based on deploying Middle Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites operating in Ka-band and using steerable spot beams to deliver connectivity 
to target customers. The satellite-earth gateway connectivity is delivered by number of earth based installation and the satellites feature handover functionality. 
The constellation currently has 16 satellites in orbit, but due to some problems only nine are used operationally. Eight more satellites are to be launched 
in 2018 and 2019. Seven next generation Boeing mPower satellites are planned to be deployed in 2021.
The proposition is not currently (nor is planned in the future) aimed at individual households (unlike OneWeb) but more as a backhaul solution that 
needs last mile access to deliver the service to the end users. The last mile solution ranges from wireless access (such as Wi-Fi) installations, to mobile cells to Google’s balloons. 
Since the set-up, O3b Networks has raised an estimated $1.7 billion and has been acquired by SES, a world-leading satellite operator with over 50 
satellites in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO). The integration of the two platforms will enable software-defined routing to direct traffic between the two platforms (mPower MEO satellites and SES’ GEO satellites)
 •Satellite installation deployments are prone to delays and technology glitches. O3b initial launch had suffered initial three year delay. Additionally some of the initial satellites had technical issues and needed to be put into a standby mode and replaced by other satellites after the issue was fixed (adding delays)
 •Slow customer acquisition: O3b has been able to only acquire a handful of customers across the ten years of existence providing backhaul services to number of isolated communities in Nigeria, Pakistan, Cook Islands and French Guiana connectivity for some U.S. government agencies and cruise ships

forward OBC will share trenching with other utilities such as water and power companies for access network installation, but also to share fiber already provided on long haul routes for SCADA applications. 
The next generation broadband infrastructure network, largely based on optical fiber, will deliver an exponentially faster and broader online experience, 
bringing benefits to society and the business sector with an enhanced delivery of communication services, cost savings, increased competitiveness and improved sustainability.
To date the company has installed fiber infrastructure which passes more than 200,000 homes, predominantly in Muscat, and has some 40,000 
connected end-users.
 •The cross-sector infrastructure sharing initiative harmonizes infrastructure laying on a more cost effective basis, and in addition allows a national backbone network to be provided quickly and for minimum cost
 •OBC initiative has greatly benefited from consensus on policy and OBC role
 •Open access passive infrastructure model quickly demonstrated its value by allowing third entrant (Awasr) to quickly enter the market which reduced prices and more choice
 •Business model may be challenged as OBC moves from being simple utility serving Muscat to providing more complex services nationwideAttributes Success CriteriaNarrative

OneWeb
Low-earth-orbit satellite constellation for operators, households and

URL: http://www.oneweb.world/
OneWeb was founded in 2012 as a satellite constellation project that aims to provide Internet connectivity globally through retail and wholesale services.
OneWeb has an initial goal to “connect every unconnected school” by 2022, and “bridge the digital divide” by 2027 by providing better and cheaper 
coverage for existing networks and new-found connectivity in remote areas. It is expected to start operation in 2019.
OneWeb had acquired the satellite spectrum that was formerly owned by SkyBridge and is planning to initially deploy 900 plus satellites at 1200 km alti -
tude that will use Ku-band and Ka-band spectrum. The on-ground deployment has plan for 50 to 60 Satellite Network Portals (SNPs) beaming Internet to 
satellites, which provides coverage for OneWeb’s operational area. To manufacture these low-cost, ultra- high performing satellites at high-volumes the company has established OneWeb Satellites as a joint venture between OneWeb and Airbus.
OneWeb will provide its retail service to households and businesses, and wholesale service to operators. OneWeb will provide wholesale services to 
Softbank under an off-take agreement.
 •No lessons learned as yet as service is not launched
 •Satellite over-crowding and satellite debris/decommissioning might be issue going forward. OneWeb has raised debates about interference with existing deployed satellites and creating more space debris. This is expected to be an issue once more satellite providers deploy their satellites, however it is not yet known what might be the consequences

OpenNet/Netlink 
Global pioneer delivering the fastest and most affordable broadband 
nationwide
URL: http://www.netlinktrust.com
In 2005 Singapore published its 10 year ICT plan under Intelligent Nation 2015 (IN2015) which, among other projects, called for the establishment of a single national fiber infrastructure with assets separated from the incumbent. The implementation task was given to the regulator, Infocom Development Agency (IDA) which ran an open international tender process for selection and awarding a single NetCo license for passive infrastructure and a single Opco license for active telecom operation under a 3 tier telecom framework that included the Retail Service Providers (RSPs) as a top layer that provides much of the service innovation. OpenNet won the Netco license in September 2008.
NetLink acquired OpenNet in 2013 as part of a consolidation process to acquire the fiber network – effectively Singtel buying out its four partners for a 
combined amount of $95 million. IDA approved the transaction with certain caveats relating to the monitoring of the operations, the role of Singtel as main subcontractor and mandating SingTel to divest the majority of its ownership in NetLink by 2018. 
As per the agreement Singtel sold 75% of its shares through an IPO in July 2017 with a value at $1.7 billion, thus completing its divestment move.

Poa! Internet service was launched in 2016 and provides wireless broadband to low income and rural communities across East Africa, offering individuals 
and small businesses highly affordable Internet access.
It competes with established service providers using mesh Wi-Fi network allowing coverage much larger than a single access point. Poa! Places its hotspots in community centers, e.g., schools, mosques, churches and youth centers. It therefore attracts community involvement through 
siting infrastructure on community assets.
Poa! pioneered innovative pricing which offers users the ability to buy access at very low cost and allow payment through the use of a mobile phone. Poa! more recently has expanded from public Wi-Fi service to home connections via private Wi-Fi router.
 •Success due to the relatively low cost of Wi-Fi equipment, the availability of spectrum and the large number of Wi-Fi enabled devices 
 •Poa! Internet innovation has been in it’s price structure. Rather than selling based on usage, it sells unlimited usage for a fixed amount of time

Project Loon is a research and development project being developed by Google with the mission of providing Internet access to rural and isolated areas.
Project Loon is trying to solve this problem by using series of balloons that will act like mobile towers. Each balloon will cover an area of over 5000 
square kilometers. 
For backhaul, the balloons will form chains of up to five balloons with the last linking to a ground based tower with each chain in the link being up 
to 40 kilometers long. Under initial planning this means that ground towers could be up to 1000 kilometers apart with expectation to grow to 10,000 kilometers which compares to maybe 40 km for a ground based network. 
 •Technology is still at a stage where commercial viability and appropriate market niche are still unclear

Red Compartida
National Mobile Wholesale Broadband Network
URL: http://altanredes.com/en/
In 2014, the Mexican government passed wide-ranging telecommunications reforms that included instruction to the Mexican telecommunications regula-
tor to establish a wholesale-only wireless network or “Red Compartida” — a “carrier’s carrier” that will sell mobile-network capacity to all newcomers. 
The initiative’s aims are 1) optimizing the usage of assigned spectrum (700 MHz band); 2) cost reductions and 3) coverage increase in regions without 
services.
The bid was awarded in 2016 to a consortium called ALTAN – which includes Axtel, Megacable, Morgan Stanley Infrastructure, the International Finance 
Corporation (IFC) and Canadian and Chinese investors. Under the terms of the Public-Private Partnership (PPP), the Mexican government is providing the radio spectrum and the use of the developed fiber network by the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) while ALTAN will assume the commercial risks of the project. 
ALTAN aims to offer incumbent MNOs additional coverage or capacity as well as serve other operators (MVNO, fixed operators). ALTAN’s concession requires that access to its network be offered on non-discriminatory terms. The goal of the wholesale, open access network is to 
facilitate market entry, and enhance competition and choice for consumers.
 •Too early to draw lessons
 •Aspirations for Red Compartida are to increase the telecommunication services coverage; promote more choice and competitive prices in telecom services; optimize the use of the assigned spectrum (700 MHz band); reduce costs and increase coverage in regions that lack access to these services
 •The aim is to achieve these objectives through the wholesale open access model operating in parallel with incumbent MNOs, and extend service to underserved areas. Viability of the Red Compartida will pivot on Altan’s ability to attract sufficient wholesale clients to its networkAttributes Success CriteriaNarrative

URL: https://www.rhizomatica.org/
Founded in 2009, Rhizomatica is enabling communities in Mexico to own and operate GSM networks. The company deployed the country’s first independent GSM network in 2014, using open source technology. 
The main focus area of Rhizomatica are rural locations that are not served by existing mobile networks. Once infrastructure is purchased and installed, 
the network is fully owned and operated by the community as a cooperative. Users are able to make local calls and send SMS messages. Where Internet access is available, users can also make long distance and international VoIP calls (VOIP calling avoids outpayments to other service providers).
Rhizomatica focuses not only on the deployment of infrastructure in rural communities, but also works to train community members to maintain and 
operate telecommunications equipment. The organization endeavors to set up networks at a cost that will allow communities to recoup their investment within a reasonable time frame. This is typically done through charging users a monthly subscription fee. Rhizomatica also advocates for regulatory reform at the national and international level to promote community based telecommunications networks.
 •Low-cost technology and low levels of subsidy can bring service to unserved communities
 •Rhizomatica was able to deploy networks after successfully arguing for authorization to use spectrum in areas not served by existing licensees. Without this regulatory flexibility, or access to open source telecommunications equipment, the deployment of these community owned networks would not be possible

SPVs are established and currently owned 100% by the project promotors (private companies). Equity partners will enter through subsequent capital increase. Following the capital increase, the project promoters will retain a minority share, and the external equity investors will get the majority (75%). Project promotors will retain management, however, but equity investors will benefit from priority financial return: repayment priority is first debt, then return to external equity, then project promotors.
Rune is building networks close to areas considered a market failure by national and EU authorities. In this respect, RUNE complements existing 
programs such as the European Regional Development Fund. By extending the area of commercial viability to rural and underserved areas, Rune will be able to obtain profits in excess of the rate of return set by regulators for white areas, and allowing for better use of state funds, for deeply rural areas.

SugarNet
Hybrid wireless broadband solution for rural areas
URL: https://www.sugarnet.co.uk
In the past few years a number of U.K. broadband ISP start-ups have utilized fixed wireless technology to overcome the rural connectivity gap created 
by the lack of suitable fixed infrastructure available through the incumbent BT. Both the Oxfordshire start-up SugarNet and their acquirer Voneus use a hybrid fiber-wireless broadband solution that extends high speed broadband to target communities. It offers packages of 20-50 Mbps symmetrical for under US$50 per month (<£35).
The business model is based on cooperation with local broadband activists or community action groups in rural areas. Voneus solicits expressions of 
interest from a minimum number of households in a community. Once community involvement secured it creates a back-haul connection to its core fiber network. Installation costs to Voneus are defrayed by the U.K. government’s program of Better Broadband vouchers, which qualifying individual customers receive gratis and then give to Voneus. There are no installation costs to individuals.
 •State actively encourages market entry through subsidy to consumers 
 •Service provider lowers market risk by getting community to pre-commit to take-up
 •Fixed Wireless Technologies with microwave backhaul have been providing more adequate solution for the rural connectivity problem as the cost will always be lower than deploying fiber over long distanceAttributes Success CriteriaNarrative

Tanzania Tri-Party 
Shared mobile rural infrastructure via national roaming
URL: N/A
GSMA supported rural connectivity project, the first of its kind in Africa, is a tri-party collaborative project that brings together three of Tanzania’s biggest 
operators (Tigo, Vodacom, Airtel), in a bid to provide 3G connectivity to selected rural locations. Six 3G pilot sites (2 from each operator) were activated in 2017. 
In these pilots, one operator built and owned the site, but the shared active equipment and spectrum allowed customers from competitor operators to 
“roam” on the site.
Network sharing via limited roaming model revealed significant benefits on both supply and demand side. On the supply side, roaming has allowed 
operators to cut down their costs significantly allowing for the deployment in unserved rural areas. From an adoption perspective roaming has boosted adoption level as it introduced more choice and better availability of products including SIM cards.
 •Despite a successful outcome, the investment case given fiscal constraints appears difficult and a barrier for further rural mobile broadband coverage expansion
 •Over a short period, the sites showed steadily increasing revenue levels despite a drop in ARPU with revenues per site estimated to reach $62,000 per year - sufficient to ensure site viability from an operational cost perspective. However, CAPEX and tax levels render rural sites unprofitable.
 •The savings generated by the sharing agreement are not sufficient to compensate for the whole investment unless some other solutions are consid-ered such as - government financial support in the form of grant or equity partnerships, implementation of low cost access solutions, lower taxes for selected sites, zero rated long-term debt. 
 •GSMA concluded that the provision of correctly allocated subsidies can significantly help mobile operators to scale the current national roaming agreementAttributes Success CriteriaNarrative

Village Telco, established in 2009, aims to provide very low cost Wi-Fi Mesh networks for villages through the selling of “Mesh Potato” CPE. 
A Village Telco Entrepreneur Server can easily be added by a local organization or entrepreneur, which will connect the local Mesh Network to the other 
telecommunications providers and allow for billing, network management, etc. 
The network is designed to be self-installed by users with relatively limited technical knowledge. To date there have been eight publicized deployments 
around the world; three in South Africa and one each in Nigeria, Colombia, Puerto Rico, Timor-Leste and Brazil. The different deployment have often been for a different reasons – to provide NGOs with an inexpensive network in Timor-Leste to entrepreneurs providing data services in poorly served areas of South Africa. 
 •Whilst not designed to be full substitute for mobile networks Village Telco is designed to allow users to move a significant amount of their traffic onto a locally owned network and reduce the associated telecommunications costs.
