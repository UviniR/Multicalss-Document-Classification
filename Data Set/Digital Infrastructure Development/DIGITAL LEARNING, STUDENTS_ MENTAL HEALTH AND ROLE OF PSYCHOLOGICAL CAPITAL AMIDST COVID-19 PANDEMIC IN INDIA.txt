1.0 Introduction:  
The infectious disease Covid -19 has triggered a chaotic social atmosphere and brought an 
irreversible learning crisis in the education sector. The pandemic has brought a paradigm shift 
to how students learn at formal educational institutions. The sudden outbreak has resulted in 
the nationwide lockdown that led to shutting down all educational institutions and made 
students stay at home. The cutting of all physical interaction and discontinuity in course studies 
has completely halted students ’ learning across the country. Amid this crisis, the country, with 
its world ’s largest young population and $180 billion education sector is switching to online in -
situ of mainstream classroom education (Abrar &Ishwas, 2020).

The young population is critical for the growth and development of a nation. India is home to 
the world's largest proportion of adolescents, with 243 million individuals aged between 10 and 
19 years (UNICEF, 2011). Adolescence is a crucial time in life. It is a transitional phase; 
individuals shift from childhood to adulthood through physical, social, educational, and 
psychological reconstructions. They learn about becoming independent, acquiring different life 
skills, learning new behaviors, and establishing social relationships. However, due to 
lockdown, the young population has been suffering from the convectional classroom 
ecosystem's learning crisis. Besides, millions of today's young populations who are likely to 
attend adulthood will also catastrophically suffer from the lack of skills required to strive in 
academic, social, and vocational realms.  
India has one of the world ’s largest education sectors. According to the All India Educational 
Survey (AIES, 2002), the country has over 1.3 million recognized schools, including primary, 
upper primary, secondary, and senior secondary schools (DESDP -NCERT, 2006). Besides, as 
per the University Grants Commission (UGC, 2017), the country has over 789 universities, 
37,204 colleges, and 11,443 stand -alone institutions. UNESCO's report has also revealed that the 
current pandemic has put over 320 million Indian learners into unfortunate adversity (Jain, 
2020).  
Amidst the lockdown crisis, following the endorsement from the international and national 
bodies, millions of Indian schools and higher educational institutions have endeavored to shift 
their physical classrooms to online to ensure 'learning never gets disrupted' for the young 
learners amidst the isolation crisis. Online platform suffices a plethora of learning 
opportunities. It is democratic in approach and can be accessible beyond geographical barriers. 
It edges over traditional classroom learning, especially in facilitating home -based learning 
opportunities for learners in times of the country -wide lockdown crisis. It has emerged as the 
most crucial alternative playing a significant role in building foundation life skills and 
providing learning experiences through different digital applications for learners across the 
country.  
However, it has been noted that despite online education becoming the only available form of 
formal education, the existing digital divide and some intrinsic limitations of online education 
made it exclusive and induced several mental health problems among students. Several cases 
were reported during the pandemic, where students and teachers had awful experiences on 
digital platforms. It was also found that, due to online bullying and the failure to attend online 
classes, students become vulnerable to various health -risk behaviors and entrap in mental 
trauma and depression, leading them to suicidal tendencies. In this connection, the present 
study endeavors to investigate the current status quo of online education in India and explore 
the different mental health problems students face in online education. The study also examines 
students' psychological capital (the developmental state of individuals characterized by hope, 
self-efficacy, resilience, and optimism) as a protective factor to moderate students ’ mental 
health problems and sustain better performance in online education.  
2.0 Research Questions:  
• How is the Indian education sector coping with the pandemic?  
• What are the mental health issues that emerged in digital learning?  
• Can students' psychological capital moderate their mental health issues and enhance 
their study engagement in e -learning?

3.0 Objectives of the Study:  
The present study tries to understand the current status quo of online education in India. It 
endeavored to understand the mental health issues of students attending online classes. Besides, 
it also intends to examine the role of psychological capital  in mitigating students' mental health 
problems and improving their study engagement.  
4.0 Method and Design:  
The present study adopts a qualitative approach, and different newspapers and pertinent 
existing studies were reviewed and analyzed using a thematic analysis method.  
5.0 Digital learning:  
During the coronavirus outbreak, the country is facing a severe crisis in the educational sector. 
To ensure education continues, HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal endorses academics and 
students to carry on their classes using digital platforms. E -learning has emerged as the most 
significant substitute for the face -to-face physical classroom that can rescue millions of students. 
Digital platforms provide a plethora of learning opportunities to help students access study 
materials and make them engage entirely in virtual classes like the face -to-face classroom 
system. Several digital platforms are boosted amidst the pandemic to ensure 'learning never 
stops.' Digital applications such as Google Meet, Google Classroom, Microsoft Teams, Skype, 
Team Link, Zoom, etc., are massively employed to provide students education. Both central and 
state governments have taken several initiatives to endorse online education amid the 
coronavirus pandemic. A detail of these initiatives is discussed in the following sections.  
5.1 Central Government ’s major responses to digital education amidst pandemic:  
To enable students and academic stakeholders to continue education amid this coronavirus 
pandemic, the government of India has taken several initiatives and has boosted some of its 
existing digital platforms. Swayam Prabha, E -pathshala, National Repository of Open 
Educational Resources, Bharat Padhe Online and VidyaDaan 2.0., PM eVidya, SCERT ’s 
YouTube channel, MOOC learning, NIOS ’s courses, National Digital Library of India, National 
Project on Technology Enhanced Learning (NP -TEL), National Academic Depository, SCERT ’s 
YoutTube channel, Virtual Labs, etc. are some of its noteworthy programs and initiatives that 
have been introduced by the government of India. A detailed description of some of these 
programs are given as follows -  
5.1.1 Swayam Prabha:  
Swayam Prabha is an initiative taken by the Ministry of HRD. It aims to provide high -quality 
educational channels through DTH on a 24×7 basis using the GSAT -15 satellite (Govt. of India, 
2020). Amidst this on -going learning crisis, it updates with at least four types of content every 
day with the frequency of five times a day. It provides learning content to students and enables 
them to master different skills. It allows students to access learning materials and classes as per 
students ’ convenience time. The contents are accessible to students through different 
educational bodies like UGC, IGNOU, NCERT, and NIOS.  
5.1.2 E -pathshala:  
E-pathshala is a web -based portal launched in Nov. 2015. It was a joint effort of the Ministry of 
HRD, CIET, and NCERT. Amidst this lockdown, the government of India has boosted the e -
pathshala with required study materials. It provides a plethora of learning opportunities to 
students, researchers, teachers, and parents. It suffices study resources like NCERT textbooks 
(class I -XII), supplementary books, periodicals, and different training modules for teachers. It 
110 ENSEMBLE, Special Issue No. 1 [March 2021]   
provides printed as well as non -printed and audio -visual materials with realistic experiences. 
Students can easily access digital textbooks and other resources from e -pathshala. They can also 
participate in various exhibitions and workshops. A total of 504 textbooks and 3886 study 
resources are made available for learners in different languages keep in mind the diverse 
linguistic backgrounds of learners (NIC, 2020).  
5.1.3 National Repository of Open Educational Resources (NROER):  
It is a comprehensive digital repository of resources that can be used by teachers in the teaching
-learning process. It was launched in 2013 by CIET and NCERT in collaboration with the 
Department of School Education and Literacy, MHRD, and Homi Bhabha Centre for Science 
Education. It aims to suffice a variety of digital resources for both students and teachers. Amid 
this on -going lockdown crisis, it also encourages community participation in developing and 
sharing digital content for students. At the time, there are 19,875 active registered users with 
more than 19,113 study resources (Government of India, 2020). It hosts many educational 
resources in many subjects for students of different levels, including primary, secondary, and 
senior secondary schools. The resources are made available in different Indian languages in 
various formats like text, image, audio, video, and document.  
5.1.4 Bharat Padhe Online and VidyaDaan 2.0.:  
A week -long 'Bharat Padhe Online' campaign was launched by the Union HRD Miniter, 
Ramesh Pokhriyal, in April 2020 to get ideas for improving India's online education ecosystem. 
The campaign was endorsed across the country and had received more than 3700 suggestions 
(MHRD, 2020). Similarly, another program that is VidyaDaan 2.0 was launched, inviting 
contributors to the development of e -contents due to a sudden spike in demand for digital 
resources amid the nation -wide lockdown.  
5.1.5 PM eVidya:  
Amidst the learning crisis, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman said that the 'PM eVidya' 
program for multi -mode access to digital education would be launched to reduce the loss of 
education of learners in times of the pandemic. The program will suffice learning opportunities 
for more than 3.7 crore students in higher education, and more than 100 universities will be 
permitted to start online courses automatically (Nandini, 2020). The program will be embedded 
with ‘Diksha’ (digital repository for school education) and will facilitate textbooks for all 
grades. So, it also aims to develop 'one nation, one digital platform.' One TV channel per class 
from I to XII will also start under the 'one class, one channel' initiative. It also emphasizes the 
use of radio, community radio, and CBSE podcast ‘Shiksha Vani ’ for students with special 
needs and to make education more accessible.  
5.1.6 Other initiatives:  
E-services like SCERT ’s YouTube channel, MOOC learning, NIOS ’s courses, National Digital 
Library of India, National Project on Technology Enhanced Learning (NP -TEL), National 
Academic Depository, SCERT ’s YouTube channel, Virtual Labs, Spoken Tutorial, E -Yantra, etc. 
are amongst the other important initiatives taken by the central government to ensure learning 
during Covid -19 pandemic.  
5.2. States ’ significant responses to digital education amidst pandemic:  
As the lockdown continues, different states ’ governments have also taken several strategies. 
The project SMILE, known as a social media interface for learning engagement, is an advanced 
111 ENSEMBLE, Special Issue No. 1 [March 2021]   
digital initiative by the government of Rajasthan on April 13, 2020. It aims to suffice online 
courses and classes to all government schools in the state through various digital platforms and 
social media. It was reported that more than 20,000 groups are created on WhatsApp, and every 
day at 9 am, study materials are shared in the groups (ET Govt., 2020). Students and parents are 
informed after sharing study materials on the groups. Students who cannot establish a 
connection through WhatsApp can easily access study materials through other social media 
platforms like YouTube and Facebook. Currently, the program has connected students in more 
than 12.78 lakh households and 3.28 teachers through 9226 and 9768 WhatsApp groups, 
respectively. About 2.5 lakh students are viewing the videos daily (Vikaspedia, 2020).  
Similarly, due to schools' closure in the pandemic, the Jammu and Kashmir government has 
decided to suffice more than 2500 educational tablets to students of classes X and XII. It has been 
planned that the tablets would bear loaded textbooks and other supplementary study materials 
(IANS, 2020). The teachers are being encouraged to form different groups for students and 
endorsed to use different platforms such as WhatsApp, Google Classroom to educate students 
during the pandemic. Different sorts of study -related activities are offered to students, including 
play -based activities, assignments, small projects, and quizzes. Besides, the state government 
has also planned to use Doordarshan on a daily basis to provide online classes.   
Further, Chhattisgarh's government has launched the 'Padhai Tunhar Duvaar ’ (education at 
your doorstep) for school students to continue their study at home amidst this pandemic. 
Through this program, millions of learners access online classes and study materials at no 
charge. The Chhattisgarh School Education Department has started this online education portal 
for schools (I -XII) and college students. The resources are made available to students, including 
video, audio, pdf lectures, notes, study materials, question papers, textbooks, etc. A total of 1.43 
lakh teachers connected with the portal and covers more than 3.77 lakh students through mobile 
or other digital gadgets (CTRI, 2020).  
With its State Education Department and SCERT, the Haryana government has launched an e -
learning program that is ‘Ghar Se Padhao Abhiyan ’ (Teach from the home campaign). It has 
connected more than 50,000 teachers through different applications such as WhatsApp, SMS, 
and phones (Sharma, 2020). The state had made physical classes continue through digital 
platforms. It suffices study materials and lessons on different subjects of arts and sciences. The 
state also planned to access online learning materials from different centrally sponsored 
schemes such as Diksha, Swayam Prabha, and E -pathshala.  
Amidst the pandemic, the government of Bihar has also launched a mobile application named 
‘Unnayan – Mera Mobile Mera Vidyalaya ’ with the joint venture of the United Nations 
Children ’s Fund (UNICEF) and Eckovation. The program was launched for students of class VI -
XII in more than 70,000 government schools in the state (Anujjindal, 2020). Besides, the Bihar 
Education Project Council (BEPC) has also endorsed educational institutions and students to 
access subject -wise study materials from Diksha using the online portal and mobile applications.   
The state of West Bengal has also ensured Bengal Board students to continue their studies 
through virtual classes. The state has planned to conduct online classes on TV channels for 
school students. The classes will be telecasted by ABP Ananda from 3 pm to 4 pm and by DD 
Bangla from 4 pm to 5 pm six days per week (PTI, Kolkata, 2020). Students will also have the 
opportunity to ask questions to students through WhatsApp and phone calls. Besides, the 
government of West Bengal also endorses educational institutions to conduct online classes for 
school students using different digital applications such as Google Classroom, Zoom, Skype, etc.  
 
112 ENSEMBLE, Special Issue No. 1 [March 2021]   
Further, Andhra Pradesh has created its self -learning education app named 'Abhiasa ’ to 
facilitate e -contents and video lectures to students (Singh, 2020). The state also uses 
Doordarshan and radio broadcast to telecast learning lessons daily for two hours in the morning 
and evening.   
Kerala has also taken several strategies to provide e -contents for students. The Kerala 
Infrastructure and Technology for Education (KITE) stated the KOOL e -learning platform to 
provide a training facility for teachers. The KITE has started digitizing school textbooks and 
placed more than 57,843 laptops and 25,011 projectors at different government schools in the 
state (Sarif, 2020). The state has also launched different TV channels to telecast curriculum -
based e -contents to students amidst this coronavirus pandemic.  
5.3 Other non -government initiatives:  
Unacademy, Khan Academy, Shaw Academy, Udemy, Gradeup, BYJU ’s e-learning platform, 
etc., are some of the important non -government digital platforms that provide a plethora of 
learning opportunities for students amidst the on -going learning crisis.  
6.0 Emerging mental health issues among students:  
Mental health is the psychological state of functioning at a satisfactory level of emotional and 
behavioral adjustment . There is overgrowing concern about the issues and problems of mental 
health across the globe, and Indian is also not exceptional. Every one hour, one student commits 
suicide in India. About 12 percent of Indian students aged between four and sixteen suffer from 
psychiatric disorders. About 20 percent of the students show signs of mental disorders, out of 
which 2 -5 percent have serious concerns like autism or bi -polar disorder (Birla, 2020). Around 
the world, about 12% of the global burden of disease are mental and behavioral disorder, and it 
is expected to increase up to 15% by 2020 (WHO, 2001) while in India, the prevalence of all 
mental disorders are at 70.5 (rural), 73 (urban) and 73 (mixed rural and urban) per 1000 
population (Ganguli, 2000) and the estimation of prevalence major mental and behavioral 
disorders at any given point of time as 65/1000 population.  
Notwithstanding, this lockdown has increased the cases of suicides among students. The cases 
of student suicides have been reported in Kerela to West Bengal, Assam to Punjab, and other 
parts of India. 'I'm leaving,' a class 10th student, Devika Balakrishnan scribbled in her notebook 
before committing suicide in Malappuram district of Kerala, India's state with the highest 
recorded literacy rate (93.91%). On Monday, June 1, the state of Kerala begins virtual class for 
over 40 lakh learners; meanwhile, the girl, daughter of a daily wage laborer, set herself ablaze 
allegedly over failure to attend the online classes due to lack of smartphone or television 
(Emmanuel, 2020). She might be the case of millions of learners who have been struggling with 
a home -deficit support system amid the Covid -19 lockdown to manage online classes across the 
country.  
Similarly, a sixteen -year -old class X student, Shibani Kumar Sau committed suicide after failing 
to attend online classes in Howrah's Nischinda in June,2020. She had no laptop or smartphone, 
the means to attend the digital classes. She was worried about her career as she was going to 
appear in the board exams (Banerjee, 2020). The suicide cases also spark in the part of North -
East India. On June 23, 2020 a 15 -year old class 10 student allegedly committed suicide in 
Western Assam's Chirang district. He ended his life due to the failure to attend online classes 
and examinations in the absence of any digital gadget. The suicide note revealed that the boy 
was under stress for the last several days as he could not able to attend online classes 
(Basumatary, 2020). In another case, a 17 -year old girl from Kotdharmu in Mansa district, 
113 ENSEMBLE, Special Issue No. 1 [March 2021]   
114 Punjab, has committed suicide as she could not attend the online classes amid the lockdown. As 
per the source, she was crying for the smartphone needed to attend online classes, but her 
parents could not fulfill her wish due to the family's poor financial condition (Bhasin, 2020).  
Thus, from the cases above, it can be said that the on -going pandemic has increased the cases of 
students ’ mental health problems that led them to various kinds of health -risk behaviors and 
suicides. In the last month, several cases of suicide have also been reportedly increasing over the 
fear of being deprived of online classes. So, there is an urgent need to take different initiatives to 
protect these students. The government and educational stakeholders, including teachers, 
parents, and the community, need to share the responsibility to ensure students' good mental 
health amidst this pandemic. Besides, studies showed that sports, yoga, physical exercise in the 
forms of PTs, mindfulness -based cognitive therapy, and complementary resources like hope, self -
efficacy, and resilience, etc., play a pivot role in fostering physical as well as mental health among 
students ( Luthans et al., 2006; Luthans & Luthans, 2015; Afzal et al., 2016; Ghaedi, 2018).  
7.0 Implications of psychological capital (PsyCap)among students:  
Psychological capitalshould have recently emerged as a crucial aspect of positive human 
psychology. Positive psychology is ‘the scientific study of positive human functioning and 
flourishing on multiple levels that include the biological, personal, relational, institutional, 
cultural, and global dimensions of life ’ (Csikszentmihalyi & Seligman, 2000) .The movement of 
psychological capital was geared by Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi  in 1998 when Seligman was 
elected as the president of the American Psychological Association. Seligman revealed that the 
earlier researches emphasized much on individuals ’ adverse health and mental illness. 
According to him, researchers had not given due attention to positive aspects. Psychological 
capital is an out of positive psychology conceptually by Luthans and his colleagues and claimed 
its potentials in organizations. According to Luthans and Youssef (2004), psychological capital is 
the positive and developmental state of an individual characterized by hope, self -efficacy, 
optimism, and psychological resilience (Luthans et al., 2007). Further, psychological capital is an 
individual's inner positive resource that has diverse potentialities. The psychological capital 
emphasizes the introspective insights of individuals to realize and actualize their positive inner 
resources. These are the inexhaustible personal resources equally crucial as human and social 
capitals in organizations ( Luthans & Youssef, 2004; Luthans, et al., 2004) . It can potentially create 
a global competitive edge for the best productive individual expression, management, and 
academic development.  
Amidst the on -going pandemic, attaining desired knowledge through online education and 
assuring mental health has appeared problematic across the country among academicians. 
Academicians urgently need to find solutions about how to ensure certain levels of online 
education and make students stay happy. The present analysis has some evidence -based studies 
supporting individuals' positive resource, PsyCap, to improve students' online performance and 
good mental health. It has also revealed the positive associations of psychological capital 
(PsyCap) with several mental mental -health -related correlates such as students' performance, 
study engagement, academic motivation, attitudes, stress, burnout, well -being, and happiness. A 
detailed description of these correlates of PsyCap has been empirically evidenced as follows -  
7.1 PsyCap and Academic Achievement:  
Kuar et al. (2018) had examined the role of psychological capital on students ’ academic 
achievement among 390 undergraduate students at a private university, Malaysia. In the study, it 
was found that there is a significant positive correlation between students' PsyCap components; ENSEMBLE, Special Issue No. 1 [March 2021]   
hope, self -efficacy, resilience, and optimism, and their academic achievements. Further, it was 
found that PsyCap had a positive effect on students ’ academic achievement. Similarly, Bressler 
et al. (2010) conducted a study examining the role of hope, optimism, and goal setting on 
students ’ academic success. A total of 219 students enrolled in online accounting courses had 
participated in the study. Findings showed a significant relationship between hope and 
students ’ grade performance. In a study, Meng (2018) had investigated the relationship between 
students' psychological capital and their academic achievement. Three hundred seventy -nine 
students (58 boys & 321 girls) from Hunan First Normal University participated in the study. 
Findings showed a significant positive relationship between overall PsyCap and overall 
academic achievements. Besides, it evidenced PsyCap (vision, corporation, confidence, & 
gratitude) significantly predicted students ’ academic achievements. Thus, it can be said that 
psychological capital is a contributing factor that helps students perform better in their 
education, leading to better academic scores.  
7.2 PsyCap, Learning empowerment, and Academic Engagement:  
In a study, You (2016) had investigated the relationship between psychological capital, learning 
empowerment, and engagement of college students. The findings showed that students' PsyCap 
had a significant and positive correlation with their learning empowerment, and learning 
empowerment had mediated the relationship between students' psychological capital and 
learning empowerment. Again, Datu and Valdez (2016) conducted a study to examine the role 
of PsyCap in predicting students ’ academic engagement. Results showed that PsyCap (hope, 
self-efficacy, resilience, & optimism) positively correlated with all constructs and predicted 
students ’ academic engagement, flourishing, and positive effects. Similarly, Farhadi et al. (2016) 
conducted a study to investigate the role of psychological capital on students' academic 
engagement. Findings showed that there is a significant positive correlation between students' 
PsyCap and their academic engagement. Moreover, it was revealed that PsyCap (hope, self -
efficacy, & optimism) predicted 24 percent variance in students' cognitive engagement. Thus, it 
is asserted that the PsyCap intervention program and PsyCap promoting steps may be taken to 
enhance students' learning empowerment and academic engagements.  
7.3 PsyCap and Academic Motivation:  
Amouei et al. (2017) conducted a study to understand the role of PsyCap (self -efficacy, 
hopefulness, resilience, & optimism) in predicting students' academic enthusiasm (cognitive, 
behavioral, & emotional). Findings showed that there is a significant positive relationship 
between psychological capital components and academic enthusiasm. It was observed that 
PsyCap components; self -efficacy and optimism predicted together 15.8% variance in students' 
academic enthusiasm. In a similar study, Saadat et al. (2019) had investigated the role of 
psychological capital on students ’ academic motivation. In the study, it was found that there is a 
significant positive relationship between academic motivation and psychological capital; hope 
(r=0.368), self -efficacy (r=0.273), resilience (r=0.221), and optimism (r=0.369). Psychological 
capital (hope, optimism, & self -efficacy) also has a predictive value that explains significant 
variance (0.25) of students' academic motivation. Academic motivation affects students' 
academic success and their level of academic achievement. Thus, it was evidenced that the 
psychological capital plays a significant role in students ’ academic motivation. So, it is urged 
that PsyCap need to be embedded in educational strategy, and besides, necessary steps also 
need to be taken to foster psychological capital in students to amplify students' higher academic 
motivation and their success in studies.   
 
115 ENSEMBLE, Special Issue No. 1 [March 2021]   
7.4 PsyCap, Stress, and Burnout:  
Ji-lin (2017) conducted a study to investigate the relationship between academic stress, learning 
burnout, and PsyCap of university students. Findings showed that there is a significant and 
positive relationship between students' stress and learning burnout, while a significant and 
negative association of students' PsyCap was recorded with their stress and learning burnout. 
Similarly, Zhong and Ren (2009) conducted a study to investigate the relationship between 
academic stress and psychological distress through the moderating effect of psychological capital 
of undergraduate students. The findings showed that students' academic stress was positively 
correlated with their psychological distress (i.e., depression). Further, a negative relation was 
found between students' PsyCap and their perceived psychological distress (i.e., anxiety). 
Besides, it revealed that PsyCap significantly moderated the relationship between students' 
academic stress and depression. In a study, Lu et al. (2018) had examined the relationship 
between psychological capital and students ’ learning burnout. In the study, the findings showed 
a significant negative relationship between PsyCap and students ’ learning burnout. It was also 
found that PsyCap components (hope & resilience) were the significant predictors of students ’ 
learning burnout. Thus, itmay be inferred that the necessary steps should be taken to prevent 
learning burnout among students, and herewith PsyCap may be proven as a protective factor.  
7.5 PsyCap, Mental Health, and Well -Being:  
Luthans and Luthans (2015) conducted a study to find out the relationship between academic 
psychological capital and business students ’ well -being. The analysis revealed a significant and 
positive correlation between students, academic PsyCap and their well -being. Further, PsyCap 
played a significant role in improving students ’ well -being. In a study, Ghaedi (2018) had also 
examined the role of PsyCap in improving students' mental health. The findings showed a 
significant positive correlation between students' PsyCap and mental health. Again, Gautam et 
al. (2019) conducted a study to examine the impact of PsyCap on students' well -being in New 
Delhi. Findings revealed a positive significant, and meaningful impact of students' PsyCap on 
their well -being. Further, Afzal et al. (2014) studied the relationship between positive 
psychological capital and subjective well -being among school adolescents. Findings revealed that 
the low level of negative emotions moderated the relationship between PsyCap (self -efficacy, 
hope, and optimism) and subjective well -being. Besides, it was also found that a high level of 
positive emotions strengthened the relationship between PsyCap (hope) and subjective well -
being. Further, Afzal et al. (2016) conducted a study focused on examining the role of positive 
PsyCap in predicting school adolescents' positive and negative emotions and subjective well -
being. Findings revealed a significant relationship between positive PsyCap, positive and 
negative emotions, and subjective well -being. It evidenced PsyCap as a positive predictor of 
positive emotions and a negative predictor of negative emotions. Moreover, it was found that 
PsyCap (hope, resilience, & optimism) is a positive predictor of students' subjective well -being. 
Thus, it can be urged that students' mental health can be improved by increasing their 
psychological capital level.  
 Thus, it was found that psychological capital and its core positive constructs have 
significant implications for individuals' study -related attitudes, behavior, performance, and well -
being. It was found that psychological capital helps students in academic achievement, academic 
engagement, academic motivation, and learning empowerment. PsyCap also fosters positive 
mental health and mitigates mental health issues like stress, anxiety, burnout, etc. Now the 
question arises whether we can develop those principal components of psychological capital 
among students. A few empirical studies were found that evidenced the possible ways to 
develop psychological capital. A study was conducted using  an experimental research design 
116 ENSEMBLE, Special Issue No. 1 [March 2021]   
where it was revealed that the positive psychological capital with its core positive constructs 
could be developed through a highly focused, 2 -hour web -based training intervention ( Luthans 
et al., 2008) . Besides, such PsyCap Intervention (PCI) also provided preliminary support to the 
increasing participants' PsyCap, which found to be high impact bearings on individuals 
(Luthans et al., 2006). Side by side, it was also found that some proactive and reactive human 
resource development (HRD) strategies like increasing psychological assets, decreasing risk 
factors, and facilitating processes are useful for the development of psychological capital 
among individuals (Luthans et al., 2006).  
8.0 Conclusion:  
In closing, it can be concluded that online education has emerged as a boon amidst the 
coronavirus lockdown crisis. It offers a plethora of learning opportunities for students. It 
ensures learning from anywhere with maintaining social distancing. The educational 
institutions have been endorsed by both central and state governments to continue e -ducation 
for students. However, due to intrinsic limitations of online education e.g., digital divide and 
unequal access to digital learning, several mental health -related issues have emerged among 
students. Students pursuing education through different digital applications have revealed 
stress, anxiety, and depression, making them vulnerable to different health -risk behaviors and 
suicides. The study has revealed the potential advantage of students ’ inner positive resource 
that is psychological capital, to mitigate these mental health problems. It was found that 
fostering positive hope, self -efficacy, resilience, and optimism helps students achieve academic 
achievement, academic engagement, academic motivation, and learning empowerment. It also 
helps students cope with mental health problems and mitigate problems like stress, depression, 
and burnout. Hence, the present study herewith urges parents and educational stakeholders to 
take the necessary steps to grow and sustain the four core positive constructs of psychological 
capital among students for improving and sustaining their academic engagement, achievement, 
motivation, and learning empowerment, on one hand, and also positive mental health, well -
being, and happiness, on the other hand amidst the on -going coronavirus pandemic.
