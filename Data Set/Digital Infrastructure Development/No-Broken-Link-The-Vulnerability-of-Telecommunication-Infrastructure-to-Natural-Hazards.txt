 Summary  
The global economy is increasingly digital. The internet and other information and communication 
technologies (ICTs) are changing the way individuals, businesses and governments operate. Their 
resilience to natural disasters, and their ability to recover in the aftermath, is thus critical to the 
resilience of the economy. This chapter discusses the impact of climate events on various types 
of digital infrastructure. It highlights key considerations for governments and digital infrastructure 
owners to make their infrastructure more resilient, while maintaining affordability of services. We 
find that digital infrastructure is vulnerable to various climate risks, but that technology choices 
and network design can improve redundancy and resilience of networks, b y design. Certain 
infrastructures warrant greater ex ante investment in their resilience considering their criticality 
in the broadband value chain (submarine cables or landing stations) while others could follow 
repair and recovery options (mobile network  antennas, poles, and towers). We conclude with 
recommendations for the public and private sectors, noting that government s and sector 
regulators can improve network resilience, and increase coordination given the distributed 
ownership and governance model s in the industry.

 1. Introduction  
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are deeply enmeshed in the day -to-day 
activities of individuals, businesses and governments , particularly with  the proliferation of the 
internet and internet -based digital solutions  and applications across society.1 Such  an increased 
dependence on digital technologies and solutions raises questions regarding the  resilience , 
security , and recovery  of the underlying infrastructure s to various categories of failures —from  
natural or man -made causes . But p rotecting digital infrastructure against, or recovering from such 
failures increase s costs, and in the case of a largely private sector- led industry would be borne 
mostly by users . This Sector Note to the report Lifelines: The Resilient Infrastructure  Opportunity  
explore the following policy question s: how does one reconcile the trade- off between ex ante  cost 
of building- in resilience, and ex  post  cost of damage and recovery of various digital infrastructure? 
And how might technological and public policy choices shape this trade -off? 
The rapid and expansive digitalization of the economy, enables greater and faster sharing of 
information driving productivity growth, reduces cost s of production, increases access to markets, 
resulting in an expansion of the tradition al economy to a digital economy. Digital infrastructure 
(including telecommunications networks and information infrastructures such as data centers) 
has now become a critical input for most industries and socio -economic ecosystems. While its 
scale, growth rate, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contribution are the subject s of debate, 
there is wide acceptance that such digital infrastructures will underpin future economic growth, 
in developed and developing countries alike.  Their disruption implies economic damage.  
In addition to facilitating the daily tasks and operations of individuals and businesses, digital 
conn ectivity through telecommunications networks is central to the operation of critical 
infrastructure and public service delivery. For  example, power generation companies and utilities 
rely heavily on digital connectivity and services in their core operation s, particularly for 
monitoring performance, fault identifica tion and resolution. ERP and CRM systems, now 
ubiquitous in public and private large enterprises, cannot function without connectivity —and in 
the case of multinational corporations, without intern ational connectivity between the vari ous 
operating units spread across the globe .2  
But this also means that critical infrastructures that were traditionally not connected to or reliant 
on digital networks are no longer “offline;” their smooth operation is also dependent on the 
stability, security, and continuity offered by the underlying  digital infrastructure. This large -scale 
                                                                    
1 World Bank, “World Development Report 2016: Digital Dividends”   
2 For instance, according to ITU’s e -Government index, all 193 UN Member States now have national 
portals and back- end systems to automate core administrative tasks, and 140 provide at least one 
transactional service online. ITU E -Government Development Index data, 2018  5 
 digitalization  means that failures in telecommunication and IT infrastructure  will cause failures of 
the associated critical infrastructure (e.g. power grids, railways, banking, retail services) .  
While the digital world manifests itself virtually where transactions and information move 
seamlessly with minimal human intervention , it is built on a foundation of physical infrastructure 
comprising of cables crisscrossing across the world, antennas, and data centers.  Failure of or 
damage to these physical infrastructures impacts connectivity and other digital services  that are 
critical for individuals, businesses, and governments . While the scale of the impact may vary 
depending on factors such as the type of infrastructure, location in the value chain, and 
downstream dependencies, their  failure will be felt by many others.  
However, u nlike other utilities or network -based infrastructure , the ICT sector  is mostly privately 
owned -or-operated globally , with a limi ted number of countries  now  having  monopolies or 
dominant State -Owned Enterprises (SOE)  in these industries. While the privatization and 
liberalization of the ICT sector has unleashed  massive investment and driven rapid gro wth in 
connectivity worldwide, it  could also mean that the arrangements for disaster readiness and 
recovery diffe r from other network infrastructures or utilities.   
Data on number and intensity of natural disasters suggests that weather related disasters are 
increasing in number and inten sity, making climate resilience and adaptability of society key 
public policy priorities.3 Resilience and continuity costs  in such cases warrant  being shared 
between the providers and users of services (including the public sector). However, in practice it  
implies an upfront risk premium often paid by the private sector, with larger scale effects and 
costs of failures being borne by a much larger set of stakeholders. Furthermore, reconciling the 
need to expand networks to provide access to broadband connectivity to all at affordable prices, and investing in resilience and recovery efforts is a key challenge faced by the telecommunications 
operators and governments .

 2. The economic importance of digital infrastructure  
As seen  in figure 1, we have recently crossed a very significant milestone: connecting half the 
global population to the internet, who are producing hundreds of exabytes of data traffic each 
month .4 As more individuals and enterprises come online, and their usage  matures, the volume 
of internet traffic is likely to increase, possibly even after achieving universal connectivity, 
requiring greater investments in digital infrastructure.  
Figure 1: Number of internet users globally

Indeed, t he rise of digital technologies and the digital economy offer a significant opportunity to 
unlock new pathways for rapid economic growth, economic mobility, innovation, job creation, 
and access to services and markets. The internet and digital technologies are exp anding access to 
global markets, changing business models, delivering enormous productivity gains, and expanding access to basic needs and services. In 2016, the global digital economy was worth $11.5 trillion, 
or 15.5% of global GDP.
5  It is expected to r each 25% in less than a decade, far outpacing the 
growth of the ‘traditional’ economy.  
Digitalization has thus transformed the way individuals, businesses, and governments  operate on 
a day to day basis. International trade, banking, and finance are entirel y digital today, and 
consumer banking increasingly so. There are approximately 3.24 million ATM machines in the 
world connected to the internet, serving the global banked population.6 Communication and 
social media remain to the most dominant uses of global internet capacity, transforming the way 
individuals interact and connect globally. Furthermore, governments  around the world rely on the

 3. The physical foundations of the virtual world  
To understand the impact of climate events on digital infrastructure, it is important to understand 
the risk to the physical infrastructure  that underpins it. The large volume of data— including all 
the i nternet traffic, financing and banking transactions, and services trade —is carried across the 
globe over  networks of cables, wireless transmitters and receivers, and satellites.  
3.1 Networks around the world: Telecommunications  
Table 1 highlights the scale of terrestrial connectivity infrastructure around the world. Globally, 
there are over 13.7 million kilometers of fiber optic  or co -axial cables deployed,8 along key routes 
between approximately 35,000 key population centers and operated by over 400 entities.  
Corning —one of the largest manufacturers of optical fiber cable ( OFC)—reported  delivering  its 
billionth kilometer of optical fiber in 2017 , demonstrating the scale of its use .9 These terrestrial 
cables are either laid underground, mostly in concrete ducts, or overland on poles and towers . In 
addition to wired infrastructure, there are nodes such as datacenters  and Internet Exchange 
Points (IXP)  that house  IT and telecom munication equipment  necessary to operate the networks .

 The figures above only account only for the major transmission routes around the world —the 
equivalent of road  highways —and do not include lengths of infrastructure deployed within 
population centers to deliver services to consumers’ premises. In addition to the terrestrial 
networks, there are  approximately 1.2 million km of submarine cables connecting continents and 
islands.11 Land -locked countries rely on terrestrial infrastructure to bring global internet 
connectivity inland from submarine cable landing stations, creating trans -continental networks.

This physical infrastructure, of varying capacity and ownership models, carries the data at the core 
of the global digital economy. Figure 3a highlights the total capacity (or bandwidth) of the 
international connectivity infrastructure —submarine cables, and international terrestrial links —
connecting the various regions of the world. Bandwidth connecting Latin America and North 
America is the highest, followed by Europe and North America, then Asi a and North America. 
Most of the information and thus economic value transmitted over the internet is carried along these routes.

Figure 3b illustrates the rapid and consistent growth in bandwidth and traffic over the last 5 years. 
This requires additional infrastructure, particularly networked infrastructure, to support the 
growing ba ndwidth needs of the world. In adding this capacity, the increased climatic risk facing 
the infrastructure should be a major design consideration, to ensure adequate redundancy while 
maximizing infrastructure sharing.  
Modern Internet Protocol12 (IP) based telecommunications networks offer a level of resilience by 
default, which can be further improved with greater physical redundancy —building denser 
                                                                    
12 Internet Protocol refers to a communication protocol in which messages (any type of data— text, audio, 
video etc.) are divided into packets before they are sent. Each packet is then transmitted individually and 
can even follow different routes to its destination. Once all the packets forming a message arrive at the 
destination, they are recompiled into the original message.  
11 
 networks. In most of the densely -wired parts of the world, there are multiple paths between any 
two points, and a failure along one pathway may not result in all downstream destinations getting 
cut off as there could be alternative routes along different alignments. Additionally, since 
telecommunications is a private sector driven industry, with multiple operators providing services 
in the same geography, there is a redundancy of services and infrastructure providers along most, 
if not all, transmission routes.  
The shorter lifespan of telecommunications infrastructure compared with other types of crit ical 
infrastructure means shorter replacement and upgrade cycles, and lower asset values.13 The 
shorter life and rapid rate of innovation also enable infrastructure owners to make technology 
choices that enable networks to be more resilient. The public sect or can also play a critical role in 
enabling the private sector to periodically upgrade their technology. However, despite these 
factors , telecommunications infrastructure remains vulnerable to disruptions from acute and 
chronic climate events.  
3.2 Nodes on th e internet: Datacenters  
Another type of infrastructure needed for networks that comprise the internet are the datacenters
14 where these networks connect, and where content is housed. The datacenters 
where telecom carriers and content providers exchange traffic or connect are called internet exchange points (IXPs).  IXPs enable multilateral connectivity, instead of requiring each operator and content provider to establish bilateral interconnection agreements with others ; hence they 
allow for faster and more c ost-effective interconnectivity among telecom operators and content 
providers. They also reduce costs significantly, particularly for developing countries, allowing 
them to connect to other operators, saving transit costs in each transaction, rather than s ending 
traffic over international links just to have it return to the country . 
 
Box 1: Datacenters  
Datacenters vary in size, depending on their ownership, the purpose or use of the data stored, 
and the required level of access to this data. For example, any domestic firm in an economy 
may have a datacenter housing operational data needed for their internal use. This may include 
such information as the customer database, orders, employee details, or payroll system data, 
and is not accessible to the outside world over the internet. Such a datacenter may need only 
a single rack of servers about the size of a closet and can be housed in a single room. On the 
                                                                    
13 Fu, Horrocks, and Winne, 2018, “Exploring impact of climate change on UK’s ICT infrastructure,” 
Infrastructure Asset Management, Vol. 3 Issue 1, Institute of Civil Engineers Publishing.  
14 Gartner defines a data center as the department in an enterprise that houses and maintains back -end 
information technology (IT) systems an d data stores —its mainframes, servers and databases. Physically, it 
is a location (ranging from an office room to thousands of square meters large facility) that houses servers 
that require heavy- duty cooling, high -quality poser and backup  12 
 other hand, large content providers or global IT companies, require a number of large 
datacenters with sufficient scalability options to serve an ever-  growing market of users  of 
internet- based services. For such companies, the core business is the data housed in these 
datacenters; they may be compared with large brick and mortar warehouses for traditional 
manufacturing businesses.  
The impact of damage or failure of smaller firm -level datacenters is confin ed to the owners, 
and a relatively limited number of users. However, in the case of global IT firms, the impact is 
substantial, in terms of the number of users, the volume of data housed, and the dependence 
of the firms and individuals relying on these dat acenters in the conduct of their own operations. 
The scale required of such datacenters has led to a trend toward larger spaces, referred to as 
“hyperscale” datacenters which offer both space and on -demand scalability.1 According to 
Cisco, there were 259 h yperscale datacenters in 2015, operated by about two dozen global IT 
companies, including Amazon, Google, Microsoft, IBM, and a number of enterprises providing 
cloud -computing services.1

3.3 Networks and nodes on the global scale  
In summary, it is the 13.7 million km of terrestrial transmission cables, 1.2 million km of submarine 
cables and their landing stations,  over 4 million mobile towers,15 ~900 IXPs, and ~400 hyperscale 
datacenters that constitute the global internet used by almost 4 billion individuals, thousands of 
businesses, and practically all governments globally.

 4. Climate impact on Connectivity  Infrastructure and Data 
Centers  
For the purposes of analysis  of the impacts of climate and other shocks, digital infrastructure can 
be categorized into the following:  
• Networked Infrastructure  
o Undersea, or submarine cables  
o Terrestrial cables —underground and overland  
o Wireless transmission infrastructure —towers and antennas  
• Nodes  
o Landing stations for these submarine cables  
o Internet Exchange Points  and datacenters  
Here, landing stations could be considered as a form of datacenter. However, they are also 
generally more secure as they are constructed for a specific purpose, with the protection of the 
landing submarine cable s being a high -priority objective in its desi gn. Table 3 highlights the impact 
of various climate events on telecommunications infrastructures, based on studies from academia 
or commissioned by public sector agencies from the UK and USA. The table s hows that acute 
events have a significant impact on almost all forms of infrastructure, with earthquakes (high 
intensity) being the most destructive across the spectrum of infrastructure elements.

Datacenters and landing stations are particularly at risk from flooding, owing to the relatively large 
proportion of electronic equipment hosted there  and involved in their operations. Submarine 15 
 cable landing stations are the most vulnerable to sea level rise, one of the most direct impacts of 
long- term climate change.  
The role played by ICT infrastructure in the global economy as a critical foundational infrastructure 
for routine operations means that the impact of climate change is already observed . Disruptions 
to networks have immediate co nsequences, not only for the owners of the infrastructure but also 
for users. As seen in Figure 4 below, a survey of the timeframe of climate risks to Standard & Poor 
Global 100 Index companies reveals the immediate impact of the risks to the ICT sector.16

The networked and interdependent nature of telecom infrastructure and services means that 
risks to telecommunication infrastructure have  system -wide impact. Climate events affect specific 
telecommunication assets, disruptions to which lead to network -wide impacts, such as reduced 
overall capacity, and overloading of unaffected assets. These network -wide disruptions impac t 
the day -to-day functioning of all industries and individuals dependent on telecommunication 
services. In addition, they may impede disaster recovery efforts, which rely heavily on the ready 
availability of communication networks.

4.1 Impacts along the value chain  
Analyzing the climate risks to different types of ICT infrastructures using the broadband value 
chain can help  better understand the impact due to loss  of or damage to each type of asset. The 
broadband value chain comprises of three  main  segments — 
• First Mile:  International internet connectivity through submarine cables or terrestrial 
cross -border links  
• Middle Mile: Domestic connectivity infrastructure linking sources of first mile 
connectivity to the population centers —mostly cables running along existing connectivity 
routes (transport and energy)  
17 
 • Last Mile: Infrastructure connecting individuals and premises to telecommunication 
networks —fiber or cable to th e home from local cabinets, mobile towers, Wifi 
transmitters  
The following sections discuss the impact of disruptions to telecommunications infrastructure in 
each segment of the broadband value chain.  
4.2 First Mile Infrastructure  
Globally, over 370 submarine cable systems connect to terrestrial networks through landing 
stations in almost all coastal and island countries. These cable systems are the main arteries of the global internet, and carry the world’s information, including virtually all international financial 
transactions.  Perhaps the most immediate effects felt by an economy because of  disruptions to 
submarine cable systems is the impact to international financial transactions, affecting every 
sector of an economy. In December 2018, SWIFT recorded an a verage of 34.16 million financial 
messages per day, with fund transfer volumes more than  USD 5 trillion per day, between 11,000 
financial institutions across all countries.

Case study 1: December 2006 earthquake in Taiwan, China.  
The great Hengchun  earthquake of December 2006 on the island of Taiwan, China,  and the 
Luzon Strait provides one of the most severe examples ever of disruptions to submarine cable 
systems. Submarine landslides triggered by the earthquake travelled over 300 km, and together 
with the resulting currents, causing 19 breaking points in 7 cable systems. Some of the damage 
was found at depths of 4000 m, and repairs were conducted by 11 vessels over 49 days.  
Internet connectivity was seriously impacted in China;  Viet Nam ; Taiwan, China; Singapore ; 
Japan ; and the Philippines . All of these countries lost a proportion of their international 
capacity. Financial services, airlines and shipping industries were significantly impacted, and 
commerce for Taiwan, China,  came to a halt . Traffic was rapidly re -routed using undamaged 
infrastructure, but the pressures on these cable systems resulted in lower quality of service, 
delays, and failures in from overloading. Following the earthquake, a survey was conducted in 
China to estimate t he impact of the disruption (Beben beschert R ückfall, Telefonzeitalter, 
Nordkurier, 2006). The results were staggering: it was found that 97% of Chinese internet users 
faced issues visiting foreign websites, and 57% felt that their life and work was affec ted.

 These financial transactions and signaling messages are sent over the vast networks of global 
submarine and terrestrial cables, the importance of which to the global economy cannot be 
overstated. While satellite communications offer an alternative,  and are extensively used in case 
of disruptions to cable systems, they can only carry a fraction of a country’s international traffic: 
one estimate states that satellites can handle only 7% of the US telecommunications traffic, at a 
significantly higher c ost per Mbps.18 While the probability of all 35 -plus cable systems going 
offline is small, their economic importance is substantial in almost every sector sectors, from 
international trade, logistics, shipping and airlines to manufacturing, energy, and the digital sector 
itself.  
While the number and frequency of faults in submarine cable systems is relatively low, parts of 
the world prone to seismic activity keep submarine cable repair teams busy . Between Taiwan, 
China,  and mainland China, for example, freq uent undersea earthquakes result in almost one 
cable break per week.19 The presence of a high activity port also makes cable breaks more 
frequent, mostly due to dropped or dragging anchors hitting garden hose sized submarine cables 
on the sea floor.  
Case study 2: The Great East  Japan Earthquake  
The Great East  Japan Earthquake  in March 2011, measuring 9.0 -9.1 on the Richter scale, was 
one of the strongest measured seismic events. The earthquake and resulting tsunami caused 
damage to a number of submari ne cable systems along the Japanese coast.  The effects of this 
disaster on internet connectivity was not as large as that in Taiwan, China, despite the event 
being of a much higher intensity. The reason for this was the adequate level of redundancy in 
Japan international connectivity, with submarine cables landing all along the country’s coast, 
in all directions. Unlike the Luzon Strait which has a high concentration of submarine cables, 
and is the only straight -line path to the island, Japan’s diversity o f submarine cable system 
routes ensured overall capacity landing in the country was not significantly curtailed. As a 
result, while there was some disruption due to cable breaks, international connectivity was 
surprisingly robust considering the scale of t he disaster.  
The continuity of operations after such a climatic event demonstrated the importance of well -
planned  diversity and redundancy of the cable network in times of need. Even with nearly half 
trans -Pacific cable systems down after the tsunami, int ernational connectivity across the Pacific 
remained mostly unaffected due to the re- balancing of traffic on unaffected cable systems.

our-world -15220942/  19 
 However, the disaster did present a unique scenario that was critical in recovery processes. 
Most of the submarine cable repair vessels in Japan were hit either by the earthquake or 
tsunami, rendering them unavailable in the immediate aftermath. The event raised awareness 
for the need to geographically diversify and protect these vessels and avoid losing recovery and 
repair c apability in a time of need.  
 
As Table 3 demonstrates, submarine cable systems are most at risk from earthquakes and 
landslides on the seabed. This vulnerability also extends to landing stations, but modern 
construction techniques make the buildings hous ing these facilities more resilient. However, 
coastal flooding and tsunamis can cause great damage to landing stations, though, while the off -
shore cables themselves may remain protected. However, if  either the cable or landing station is 
damaged, the impact to international connectivity is the same.  
One example could  indicate  the impact of climate and man -made events on submarine 
connectivity.  The most recent submarine cable break to make global headlines happened on 
January 20, 2019 on t he Tonga –Fiji submarine cable that connects the Kingdom of Tonga to the 
outside world suffered sudden outage. The damage to this cable and the Tonga Domestic Cable 
was believed to be caused by a ship’s anchor and  resulted in multiple cuts and the removal o f the 
cable from its trench. The repair process took 11 days to complete, during which the island nation 
was left entirely isolated from the outside world, with no mobile or internet access.  
The USD 30 million cable system supported a significant portion o f the country’s economy, and 
the effects of its outage were felt across the board by citizens, businesses and government.20 
Tonga’s economy relies heavily on tourism and international remittances. Both  sectors came to a 
near standstill, owing to their highly digitalized nature. Hotel owners and operators could not 
access booking information and respond to queries from online hotel booking portals, airlines 
could not take bookings, and families could not receive remittances from relatives working 
overseas, mo stly in New Zealand.  
With satellite connectivity as the only other back- up option, the total bandwidth available to 
country was reduced by a factor of over 200. The satellite link kept essential government services operational, but the private sector and citizens faced the brunt of the outage. Non -essential 
websites such as social media were blocked to conserve the limited bandwidth available —at a 
time when over 80% of Tonga’s internet traffic was used internationally to access Facebook. The

 country’s tour ism sector relies heavily on social media, as does the community in staying in touch 
with its international diaspora.21  
This case also provides evidence of the vast difference in resilience capability between 
government telecommunication networks and priva tely-owned networks. While public networks 
have adequate redundancy, and prioritize access to back -up connectivity, the private sector relies 
on its ability to recover rapidly, ensuring continuity of business through commercial agreements 
with other carrie rs if necessary. In Tonga’s case, however, satellite was the only alternative. The 
cost of any added resilience or redundancy in private networks will have to be borne by the 
consumers —the citizens of Tonga. The limited market size does not build a busines s case for 
another submarine cable to the islands, and the price implications for broadband services, even 
if a business case for redundancy was made, are too high.   
However, innovations in low -cost remote area connectivity, like Low Earth Orbit satellite s, can 
offer relatively affordable solutions for back -up connectivity. These technologies are still in their 
nascent stages of commercialization: until they mature, the risk of inadequate redundancy will 
continue to remain high for small island states and other countries with single sources of 
international connectivity.  
As submarine cable systems continue to proliferate, the possibility increases that these systems will face the challenges of long -term climate change, such as rising sea levels. The 
telecom munications industry and policymakers need to consider all coastal hazards and  plan new 
deployments of critical international connectivity infrastructure accordingly. Low -cost 
containerized solutions, for example , can give future landing stations coastal presence for critical 
ICT equipment, while the cable is backhauled to a more secure location where the majority of the equipment, and thus the landing station itself, is located. These are nascent solutions, but th e 
industry should consider such innovations when making investment decisions with over 20 -year 
outlooks, that factor in climate risks.  
A submarine cable landing station is essentially a combination of buildings, underground ducts and conduits, IT and telec ommunications equipment, cooling equipment and power back up. 
Submarine cable systems are built with a 20 -25-year outlook, as are the landing stations (see Box  
2). However, the equipment within the landing stations may undergo several upgrades and 
replacem ent during the life of a cable system.  
With the equipment shelter —the landing station building— being the asset with the longest 
lifespan, upgrades to other elements cannot heavily impact the overall resilience of the landing

 21 
 station. In addition, since the landing station is a completely immovable asset, it must withstand 
all possible climate events during its lifecycle.  
Box 2: Expected useful life of telecommunications infrastructures22 
The table below summarizes the expected  useful life of various types of digital infrastructures, 
based on operator reported figures, and industry experience, indicating the period to be 
considered for planning of resiliency.

 The telecommunications sector also relies heavily on civil works and on the construction 
industries. These industries, in turn have to keep pace with resilience efforts, in order to ensure 
the resilience of telecommunications infrastructure. While the use of concrete ducts makes 
underground cables significantly more resilient compared with simple trenches, improvements in 
construction and design to make these ducts more resilient to earthquakes and landslides can 
further improve the climate resilience of th e telecommunication infrastructure they carry.  
Hence, legislation and regulation in civil works and other related industries thus also play a major 
role in increasing the resilience of telecommunications infrastructure. Instruments such as 
construction cod es and land categorization can improve the overall resilience of an economy’s 
infrastructure, including telecommunications infrastructure. The interdependencies between the

experience  22 
 critical types of infrastructure in an economy —transport, energy, telecommunication , and 
water —allow for collaboration on common interests such as the resilience of shared 
infrastructure, and continuity of business. In this way, non -telecom issues such as construction 
codes and infrastructure classification can help make landing stations  more resilient.  
Telecommunications infrastructure, being networked, always has upstream and downstream 
elements. A submarine cable landing station is perhaps the most upstream element in a country’s 
telecommunications infrastructure. Connectivity from the  landing station must  be brought inland, 
or in the case of landlocked countries inland from a border, to population centers. Connectivity 
must  make its way to the closest carrier hotels23 and IXPs, to other cities, and through last mile 
networks to subscrib ers. Having a resilient landing station that can operate under over 6 feet of 
coastal flooding, does  not achieve much if the network beyond the landing station fails in the 
same scenario. This will be discussed further in the following sections , beginning with the middle -
mile.  
Case study 3: Intentional sabotage  
In 2013, a diver intentionally cut the South East Asia -Middle East -Western -Europe 4 (SMW 4) cable 
system. The presence of eight submarine cables between Egypt and Europe should have provided 
sufficient redundancy to prevent significant impact on the country’s connectivity. However, four 
cable systems reported faults or breaks during the same week, resulting in overloads and 
congestion on the active cable systems. This resulted in Egypt’s internet speeds crashing by 60%, with impacts on all telecom operators in the country.  
The damage took approximately 20 hours to repair, resulting in immediate economic losses.  
However, impacts in terms of reduced speed and difficulties connecting to international websites 
were felt for days. In another case of intentional sabotage in 2007, Vietnamese pirates stole optical 
amplifiers which left a cable system inoperative for 79 days.  
 
4.3 Middle Mile Infrastructure  
The middle mile of broadband networks consists of telecommunications infrastructure 
connecting population centers within a country, as road highways do. These connectivity routes 
can also interconnect internationally across terrestrial borders, and form part of the global internet. Countries with well -developed telecommunications sectors have dense middle mile 
networks, with a larger number of routes, and carriers per route
 
                                                                    
23 Carrier hotels, or Meet -Me-Rooms, are locations where multiple telecommunications carriers 
terminate their cables, enabling bilateral or multilateral connectivity with other carri ers present in the 
location.  23 
 Unlike electricity, the transmission routes c arry two -way traffic  and are now multipath routes by 
default (due to how IP networks operate) , so a break at one point of the network does  not 
necessarily mean everything downstream is disconnected. Large parts of the network can be 
revived using alternative routes, which may originate downstream from the failure point. 
However, infrastructure sharing between operators, and with other industries, is reducing this 
redundancy and increasing risk.

This middle mile infrastructure —consisting mostly of fiber optic cables —is either carried overland 
on tower, electricity transmission pylons, or poles, or underground in concrete ducts, or via simple 
trenches. In addition to the cables themselves, a few  interco nnection points along the 
transmission routes allow access networks to connect to the internet. These interconnection 
points house IT and telecommunications equipment and  require power supply and back up.  
As illustrated in Box 2 , the useful life of the cables, and of the passive infrastructure supporting 
them, is over 15 years, and in the case of ducts, it can be extended further. This segment of the 
broadband value chain is perhaps the most resilient, and the least at risk. Unlike other utilities, 
telec ommunication networks carry two -way traffic. As a result, an interruption at one point in the 
network may not impact all downstream elements if alternative routes are available. Additionally, 
the infrastructure itself is extremely compact —only as wide as a garden hose —and is armored, 
reducing its exposure to climate events.  
Table 3 highlighted the fact that the primary risks to the aerial and underground cables of middle mile infrastructure come from earthquakes, landslides and strong winds. Underground 13.6

 infrastructure is also at risk from flooding. Infrastructure that runs along coastlines is perhaps 
most at risk, with exposure to multiple hazards. The availability of hazard maps allows for more 
effective decision -making about infrastructure choices for new network deployments. The 
potential resilience of telecommunication networks because of  design and technology choices, is 
most visible in the middle mile, and should be leveraged to the greatest possible extent to build 
greater redundancy, and thus more res ilient telecommunication infrastructure. Telecom 
operators can use commercial arrangements to build redundancy into their networks and  share 
infrastructure to reduce capital expenses in network roll -out. These savings can in turn be directed 
towards buildi ng the resilience of the most at -risk infrastructure.  
In Nepal, for example, the national backbone of middle mile infrastructure underwent significant 
improvements through investments in ducts, and in the overall strengthening of the 
infrastructure. As a r esult, during the 2015 earthquakes, the national backbone remained 
functional. However, last mile infrastructure took severe damage,24 illustrating the value of timely 
and targeted investment in infrastructure resilience, and the consequences of not taking a view 
of the entire value chain.  
Datacenters are an important element of the digital ecosystem, and a vital component of core 
digital infrastructure. While large hyperscale datacenters are in  a limited number of countries, 
there is a growing trend toward s local content, and major digital players like Facebook and Google 
are placing edge nodes in various parts of the world to serve local markets. As these are the most frequently -accessed websites globally, this results in most of  the national internet traf fic 
remaining within these countries where these nodes are located. This may not be the case in several smaller and emerging markets without such nodes.  
Industry leaders in datacenter are constantly innovating, with scalability and low energy consumption a nd wastage as consistent themes. Containerized modules within large datacenters 
allow for on -demand scalability and efficient energy use. They also facilitate the phased upgrade 
of technology, and in turn, continuous improvements in resilience. However, mo st datacenters, 
such as the ones used by schools, small companies, and remote offices of government agencies 
are not purpose -built independent facilities. Instead, they are often housed in spare rooms of the 
infrastructure owner’s office premises. This infrastructure is as resilient as the buildings housing 
it, and the infrastructure of the telecom operators providing the connectivity.  
Increases in air and water temperatures affect the output and efficiency of steam and gas turbine -
based generators. By the 2080s, under the 4°C climate scenario, this will diminish the effective 
capacity of electricity networks by reducing the average rating of overhead lines in the distribution 
network by 6 –10% —although the reduction could be up to 27% for some components. Th ese

 reductions in performance are smaller than recent historical load growth, which has typically been 
1.5–2% per annum.25 
Case Study 4: Resilience of data centers (Australia, Hotmail, AWS)  
In January 2015, on the second hottest day of the summer, thousands  of residents in the city 
of Perth, Australia, found themselves suddenly disconnected from the internet. The Internet 
Service Provider (ISP) had suffered cooling system failures in part of its data center. While under 
normal circumstances the failure may n ot have led to network outages, fears of server failure 
in the increased heat led the ISP to shut down the servers impacted by the cooling system 
failure. While annoying and cumbersome for residential customers, the economic impact of a 
loss of connectivit y is felt almost immediately by businesses. Simple tasks such as paying for 
goods with a credit card become impossible without internet connectivity.  
This was  not the first, and will unlikely be the last, incident of network or service outage 
resulting fro m the overheating of servers in data centers. And as global temperatures rise, the 
cooling requirements of data centers will increase proportionately, more so as hyper- scale data 
centers proliferate. In June 2012, an Amazon Web Services data center suffered a power outage 
resulting from a severe storm in Northern Virginia. The storm led to power outages at the data 
center, which hosted services such as Netflix, Instagram and Pinterest, all of which were offline 
for over 2 hours that evening. In August of th e following year, a heat spike in certain servers 
resulting from a failed routine firmware update took down Hotmail and Outlook for 16 hours.  
Increasing temperatures and water shortages hit at the core of data center vulnerabilities. The 
rising temperatures and diminishing water tables under climate change will make cooling 
increasingly challenging at industrial scales. The Uptime Institute —whic h tracks data center 
trends - estimate that companies today can spend almost 80% of cost of running their server 
on cooling them. A decade ago, cooling costs were close to 150% of computing costs; while this 
improvement in energy consumption is significant , cooling remains a major challenge.  
It is not surprising then, that large new data centers are being established close to the Arctic circle, to keep the servers as cool as possible, reducing energy consumption significantly. Big 
technology players such a s Google are also working on innovations within their existing facilities 
to improve cooling efficiency. By successfully managing cold and hot aisles in their data centers, 
Google has dropped cooling costs to approximately 10% of computing cost of their se rvers.

assessment of climate risks to infrastructure.', Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society A : 
mathematical, physical and engineer ing sciences., 376 (2121). p. 20170298.  26 
 While these innovations and investments will continue to strengthen the resilience of data 
centers, the fragmented ownership and consolidation of resources among a few large players 
is a challenge.  
 
4.4 Last Mile Infrastructure  
Last mile infrastructure refers to the modes of access and  supporting telecommunications 
infrastructure through which end users access connectivity services. These include both wired and wireless access, like traditional cable, fiber to the premises, WiFi, and mobile broadband inter alia. 
The density of last mile infrastructure follows population density and is highest in urban areas. 
Telecommunications service providers rely on a combination of aerial and underground 
infrastructure to extend access to services to their end users , including electricity and telephone 
poles and underground ducts.  
The high density of other types of physical infrastructure makes last mile telecommunication infrastructure more prone to damage. For example, repairs being carried out to an underground 
water pipe may result in damage to fiber optic cables laid alongside. Similarly, in the event of a 
natural disaster such as a major storm or earthquake, debris from other physical structures can 
damage telecommunications infrastructure in its vicinity.  
Additionally, since it is the segment of the value chain to which users are exposed, disruptions at 
this level of the network have an immediate impact and  can cause a significant amount of distress 
in emergency situations. Telecommunication services are vital to disaster response and recovery 
efforts and  play a critical role in the effective delivery of food, water, and building supplies by 
governments and humanitarian organization .
26 Furthermore, individuals need connectivity 
services to reach out to family and friends in the aftermath of a natural disaster.  
The physical infrastructures most prevalent in last mile access —poles and antennas —are 
inherently quite resilient and  can withs tand significant climate pressures. For example, mobile 
antennae, like the wooden and metal poles  used for electrical and telephone wires, can withstand 
winds up to 250 km/hour. However, falling trees or dislodged debris can damage the 
infrastructure and c ause failures, and are unavoidable. Investments to ensure timely recovery of 
services in the event of a disaster may thus be more effective than investments in protecting 
exposed last mile assets.  Additionally, there is a dependence on energy supply contin uity as well, 
to power the communications equipment. While most mobile towers and antennas are equipped 
with backup batteries or generators, damaged roads can make refueling a challenge in the case 
of extended power outages.  
                                                                    
26 UNOCHA: Information Management: http://www.unocha.org/what -we-do/information -
management/overview  27 
 In areas under high risk of spe cific climate events —such as annual tropical storms, or heavy 
snow —efforts to protect the infrastructure against these specific hazards should be made. 
Examples of how wireless operators in the US protect infrastructure against an annual storm 
season provide valuable lessons and are discussed later in this chapter.  
Case Study 5: Hurricane Sandy —Damage and lessons learned  
Hurricane Sandy demonstrated the impact of acute weather events on telecommunications infrastructure. New York City houses several  
“carrier hotels”, where international carriers 
interconnect to form the global internet, and this made the impact of a Sandy -scale event 
potentially catastrophic. Additionally, one of the challenges faced by advanced economies —of 
upgrading legacy telecom infrastructure —was revealed by the storm.  
Several office locations belonging to large operators like Verizon and AT&T flooded because of  
the storm surge, which also led to power failures, further complicating matters for service 
providers. Also, as the sto rage of back -up power and fuel on the top of buildings has been 
prohibited in New York post -9/11, most back- up power options failed as they were submerged 
in basements.  
The carrier rooms in these office locations suffered catastrophic levels of damage, wit h miles 
of copper cables rendered useless. The large amount of copper cables in New York’s networks 
made matters worse, and this highlights the dangers of the delayed replacement of legacy 
systems in advanced economies: in many developing countries, the in itial build -out of networks 
has leapfrogged the copper generation. Verizon not only lost significant infrastructure in their 
two 90,000 cubic feet plus vaults carrier vaults in Manhattan, but also across multiple manholes 
(physical access points for the de ployed underground cables ) in the city.  
During the hurricane, telecom operators had to deploy back -up and restoration equipment 
which included makeshift mobile towers called Cells -on-Wheels, and the more transportable 
versions called Cells -on-light -trucks . The storm led to creative problem solving, and 
collaboration among operators. AT&T and T -Mobile USA joined together in an unprecedented 
agreement that allowed their customers to roam for free on either party’s networks, 
maximizing their joint remaining c overage.  
Verizon estimated the loss at approximately $1 billion and  did not see the value in repairing 
their existing network. Instead they took it as an opportunity to replace the copper networks with fiber optic cables, which are more resilient to water damage.
27 Verizon also undertook 
several other resilience -enhancing measures to protect their critical infrastructure. The carrier 
vaults and the fuel storage and pump rooms were made water -tight with submarine doors to 
ensure continuity of operations. Ope rators also stepped up efforts to be better equipped to

sources that can be rapidly deployed.  
 
Case Study 6: Puerto Rico —Making telecom infrastructure more resilient after hurricane 
Maria  
Puerto Rico’s infrastructure did not  fully  recover from Hurricane Irma, with h alf the island’s cell 
sites still offline a week after the event . But only two weeks after experiencing hurricane Irma, 
Puerto Rico suffered a near -total loss of connectivity in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria.  
95% of cell sites were offline, and it is estimated that 91% of private telecommunications 
infrastructure was damaged during the hurricane. Operators reported that 80% of above -
ground fiber and almost 90% of last mile fiber was destroyed in the hurricane as well.  Until 
January 2018, it is estimated that 60% of the online telecommunications infrastructure had to 
rely on diesel generators. Also, only one submarine cable supported the island’s international 
connectivity at the time. In all the island sustained an estimated US $ 1.5 billion in damage to 
telecommunications infrastructure alone.  
The near -total collapse of telecommunications also impacted emergency response and 
recovery coordination  efforts: callers struggled to get through on the 911 emergency line, and 
response teams could not be easily dispatched.  
Limited maintenance of telecom infrastructure was highlighted as a root cause of its lack of 
resilience and the extent of the damage i t suffered. The extensive above- ground deployment 
of fiber optic and landline cables ( as opposed to using underground ducts ) was also identified 
as a major cause of the extent of network outage and infrastructure damage. Inefficiencies in 
emergency respons e were a lso identified.  
The recovery plan for the island highlights such activities as public and private sector capacity 
building as pre -requisites for creating the right enabling environment for investments in 
innovative critical infrastructure —includin g telecommunication infrastructure.  Some of the key 
steps being undertaken are:28 
• Building GIS capability to allow for improvements in public safety, disaster recovery, 
emergency response, community planning, infrastructure deployment planning etc.  
• Consolidating or upgrading existing Land Mobile Radio Systems supporting microwave 
wireless communication  
• Implementing standardized power backup  
• Developing communication networks in rural areas  
                                                                    
28 Post Hurricane Maria reconstruction plan —Puerto Rico  29 
 • Upgrading 911 services to current technology  
• Procuring mobile emergency communication equipment  
• Improving connectivity to mainland USA through submarine cables to increase 
redundancy  
• Streamlining processes for permitting and rights of ways authorizations for telecom 
network deployment  
• Performing periodic site struc tural audits of Government  telecom towers  
 
Technology choices can also play a key role in enhancing the resilience of telecommunication 
infrastructure. The continued use of legacy copper wires in New York possibly resulted in greater 
damage than if the infrastructure had already been upgraded to fiber optic cables , which are 
better insulated  from water damage  by design . Similarly, innovative technologies are  becoming 
increasingly relevant to service recovery efforts. Advances in low -cost, long -range drone 
technology have enabled the deployment of unmanned drones to provide coverage over disaster 
hit areas. Transportable antennas, towers on wheels, and other m odular transmission solutions 
are also being mainstreamed by mobile operators globally. The public sector can play a key role 
in facilitating the testing and adoption of such innovations through incentives, through potential 
shared ownership models, and th rough emergency authorizations to deploy such technologies in 
post -disaster recovery efforts.  
 
Box 3: Infrastructure sharing  
The telecommunications sector has a long history of sharing infrastructure, and more recently, 
of sharing services. Mobile operators have recognized the benefits of sharing towers with each 
other, leading to reduced costs and faster network deployment. Additionally, telecom 
operators also engage in commercial agreements to lease capacity from each other to reach 
new markets al ong routes where their own infrastructure is not deployed.  
In recent years, telecom -ready infrastructure in other sectors —particularly energy and surface 
transport —have also been utilized by telecom operators to deploy networks. With civil works 
constituti ng between 60 —90% of the cost of deploying fiber optic networks, the business case 
for sharing these costs within and between sectors is clear. And in their efforts to extend access 
to connectivity to rural and remote areas, governments globally are promot ing such 
infrastructure sharing as a cost reduction mechanism.  
However, in countries with lower density of telecommunication infrastructures (for example 
fewer routes and operators per route), limited infrastructure sharing can also contribute 
towards redu cing the redundancy of telecommunication networks .  
Policymakers and sector stakeholders should thus consider how sharing can help physical 
redundancy of telecommunication networks , with cost reduction and resilience enhancement.  
 30 
 5. Avoiding broken links  
Telecommunications infrastructure, as described earlier, includes a variety of assets with a wide 
cost range. For example, fiber optic cables, the actual superhighways of the internet, cost a fraction per kilometer when compared to roads or railways. While t he telecom and IT equipment 
housed in data centers and submarine cable landing stations, mobile towers and antenna are 
significant capital expenses, the total cost of digital infrastructure in a country will still be much 
lower than that of the total elect ricity or surface transport infrastructure. Being networked 
infrastructure, it allows owners and regulators to identify  and rectify points of failures , enabling 
steps to be taken in advance to mitigate against increased exposure by establishing redundancie s, 
or increasing resilience.  
However, there are also physically exposed assets, such as antennae, that may  not warrant 
investment in ex- ante resilience, and can instead be easily replaced in the event of a disaster. 
Investing in the protection of these assets would not yield proportional returns, compared with an investment in backups or restoration preparedne ss. 
As a result, owners of telecommunication infrastructure need to consider three types of resilience 
investment decisions :  
• investment in ex- ante resilience;  
• redundancy; and  
• investment in restoration and post- disaster back up.  
The choice of the strategy is driven by the economic value of the infrastructure, and the role it 
plays in the network. A submarine cable system landing station is an investment of both high 
economic values , and of high value to the network. Such an asset wo uld warrant ex -ante 
investment in its resilience. Datacenters also fall under this category of telecommunications assets, particularly hyperscale datacenters that cost millions of dollars in capital expense.   
Middle mile infrastructure offers the opportunity to create multiple pathways between population centers in a country. Well -functioning telecommunication sectors tend to have 
competitive domestic wholesale markets, with multiple players and routes. This creates 
opportunities for commercial arrangements  to create redundancies, both for service providers 
and their users. While the sector is highly competitive in general, telecommunications operators 
collaborate through commercial negotiations to establish redundant routes, and are able to cope 
with faults  and failures, with minimal impact to subscribers, by routing traffic through these 
alternative routes. This segment of the broadband value chain demonstrates the inherent 
resilience of telecommunication networks, and this “comparative advantage” of the se ctor should 
be leveraged to maximize its resilience.  Governments  can also use regulatory tools to facilitate 
the above through cost reduction, pro -competition, and transparency regulatory actions.  31 
 Private sector players are increasingly investing in recove ry and service restoration preparedness 
to counter the impacts of acute climatic events on last mile infrastructure29. The last mile of the 
broadband value chain often suffers the most damage, and in the event of a disaster, citizens, 
businesses and governm ents feel the impact directly through lost communication services. The 
recent cases of hurricane damage in Florida and Puerto Rico have demonstrated both the 
devastating impact on last mile networks, and the possibility of rapid recovery if preparations are 
adequate (or indeed, its converse).   
The telecommunications sector faces unique challenges when compared to providers of other 
types of infrastructure, and these challenges add to the complication, and thus the risk, of 
investment decisions in infrastru cture resilience. Despite being a largely privately owned and 
profitable industry, the telecommunications sector continues to play a utility -like role in an 
economy, delivering critical infrastructure to people and businesses. Most providers of critical 
infrastructure are either partly or fully government owned, or significantly regulated. They do not 
experience the challenges of fragmented ownership, competition, and lack of public sector funds typical of the telecommunications sector.  
Some of these secto r-specific considerations that eventually impact investment decisions in 
resilience are discussed below.  
Private and distributed ownership: Telecommunications infrastructure globally is largely 
privately owned, and in the case of submarine cable systems, o ften owned by multi -country  
consortiums. Because of  this distributed  ownership  (including across jurisdictions) , information 
on the existing resilience levels of infrastructure can be incomplete, and decisions to invest in 
resilience become challenging. Differing ownership  structures  and management priorities can 
also result in varying levels of resilience of infrastructure, with little or no outside visibility on the 
subject , except because of  mandatory regulatory reporting .  
To cope with this issue , the  datacenter industry has evolved internationally in a culture of 
adherence to standards. These standards and certifications serve an important marketing role for 
the industry, and their providers demand commensurate prices. In the case of 
telecommunication s access networks, individual consumer s are the primary market, and 
competition is driven by network coverage, price and service offering, not by the resilience of the 
operators’ infrastructure to shocks. However, due to the increasingly important role con nectivity 
plays in the economy, institutional subscribers demand certain service levels and assurances of business continuity and  enforce them through Service Level Agreements (SLA) with their 
connectivity providers.  
                                                                    
29 Refer case study on preparedness for hurricane season in the USA  32 
 Reconciling resilience needs and the a ffordability of connectivity services: With broadband 
connectivity now considered a necessary pre -requisite to compete in the global economy, 
significant efforts are being made to achieve universal access to broadband services by 2030. The 
affordability of services is a significant barrier to achieving this goal; accordingly, the UN 
Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development recently reduced its target for affordability 
of services from 5% to 2% of GNI per capita for an entry -level broadband plan.30  
Telecommunications operators face a difficult challenge in reducing prices, particularly given the 
stiff competition in the market. Making their digital infrastructure more resilient may involve 
additional investment that does not offer immediate returns. P rivate sector operators often cite 
the lack of a business case for investing in resilience, and the lack of standardized approaches 
across the industry to estimate the risk, magnitude , and likelihood of natural disaster  impacts 
makes the production of such  business cases and collaboration among operators more difficult. 
In the meantime, pressures to compete in the market, and to onboard new subscribers generally 
receive a greater share of investment and attention.  
Cross- sector interdependencies of the telec ommunication sector:  The utility -like role of the 
telecommunications sector has been highlighted earlier in this Note . One would be hard -pressed 
to think of sectors that do not have a digital component in their value chains (See Box 4 ). However, 
some cross- sector relationships take primacy due to their criticality. For example, the 
telecommunications sector cannot function without power  to run the equipment making up the 
digital infrastructure, and the sector’s customers cannot use services without access to electricity 
either. Power outages are common during climate and other shocks and  preparing for these is an 
important consideration . While generators and battery back -up are available at all critical 
telecommunications infrastructure  sites, they still need to be accessible to be supplied with fuel 
if the initial stock expires. In the case of severe flooding, it may be impossible to replenish the 
necessary supplies of fuel or batteries.  
While the public sector directly supports resilience and recovery efforts in the case of most other critical infrastructures, this could be difficult to institutionalize in the case of the 
telecommunications sector. However, the public sector can encourage or incentivize investment 
in resilience by the private owners of infrastructure as part of their upgrading and expansion plans. The case of the telecommunications sector has thus demonstrated that the public sector 
can play an enabling role in private sector- led growth, filling investment gaps when nec essary. 
The same approach could extend to building resilience of telecommunication infrastructure.

 Box 4: Cross -sector interdependencies  
ICT has evolved from being a sector making an independent contribution to an economy to one 
that also boosts the con tribution of each of the other sectors in that economy. Fu et al  highlight 
cross -sector interdependencies and the risks that arise from these. Below are some examples 
of certain categories of sectors or systems that depend on ICT:1 
• Business -as-usual:  Customer transactions (including electronic banking); Staff- to-staff 
communication (e -mail, phone call, videoconferencing); Financial management; E -
commerce; Ticketing and billing systems; Customer/passenger information systems; 
Healthcare provision; Auto mated Teller Machines  
• Control Systems:  Traffic signaling; Traffic management; Navigation (waterborne, 
satellite - and land -based); Vehicles —road and rail; Aircraft and marine vessels; Rail 
signaling; Air traffic management; Supply chain management; Logistics (dispatch and 
delivery of goods); Real- time delivery management and reporting; Supervisory Control 
and Data Acquisition (SCADA); Remote management of pumps and switches in 
network; Water distribution; Energy generation and distribution; ICT network 
mana gement  
• Incident Management: Policing, fire and rescue, ambulance; Transport delay 
rectification; Natural emergencies response; Man -made emergencies response  
The criticality of telecommunication services demonstrates the knock -on effects of failures in 
netw ork connectivity. Additionally, the dependence of telecommunication service providers 
and users on electricity and other infrastructure also creates challenges during natural 
disasters. The reliance of each contributing sector on the others’ business proto cols and climate 
resilience efforts creates a chain of dependencies, with effects throughout the ecosystem in 
case of a single element failing.  
 
International best practices have shown that policy leadership in raising awareness and taking a 
system -wide v iew of the resilience of critical infrastructure achieves results. Economies facing the 
challenge of replacing legacy infrastructure are particularly at risk of suffering significant loss to 
their telecommunication infrastructure in the case of acute clima te and other events: the damage 
to legacy copper cabling during Hurricane Sandy is a case in point. In Nepal, by contrast, 
investments in reinforcing backbone networks paid dividends during the 201 5 earthquake, when 
most of the damage to telecommunications  infrastructure was limited to last -mile assets. Below 
are some case studies highlighting other resilience efforts undertaken globally.  
Case Study 7: Braving the Atlantic storm season  
The hurricane season 2017 was a particularly devastating for the Caribbe an and southern 
United States, with the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico suffering near- complete devastation 
of critical infrastructure, and a number of mainland areas in Florida and neighboring states 34 
 experiencing storm related losses. The relative impac ts on the islands and on the mainland US, 
provide a useful illustration of the importance of building the resilience of infrastructure against 
such events.  
In the US, the annual recurrence of hurricane season has prompted significant resilience and 
recover y preparation by telecom operators, and public sector- driven warning, preparation, 
relief and recovery efforts have resulted in improved resilience and faster recovery.  While last 
mile infrastructure can be made resilient through certain good practices, vi olent climate events 
are likely to cause damage to exposed assets such as towers and antennae, and even 
underground assets like ducts and cables. Operators need to be prepared and have the 
resources and assets in place to restore services as quickly as pos sible. This has led the telecom 
sector in the USA to mainstream innovations such as Cells -on-Wheels, mobile power backup, 
and distributed fuel storage systems inter alia in.  
Public agencies and operators have also increased awareness efforts to prepare th eir clients 
and the general population for potential disruptions, providing tips to minimize impact. The 
Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the telecom sector regulator, also awards short -
term Special Temporary Authorizations (STAs) to restore commun ications in the aftermath of 
disasters. In 2017, FCC awarded almost 1,000 STAs in the recovery efforts after hurricanes 
Harvey, Irma and Maria.  
The FCC was also proactive in the activation of emergency response and disaster recovery 
teams in anticipation o f hurricanes. For example, FEMA and DIRS were activated for all 
hurricanes, and significant outreach efforts undertaken to ensure smooth reporting, 
information sharing and coordination in continuity of operations, restoration and recovery efforts.  
Years of  iterative preparation resulted in rapid recovery times in hurricane affected parts of 
mainland USA. However, the US Virgin Islands were unfortunately severely battered by both 
Hurricane Irma and Maria in a short time period, leading to near complete loss of 
telecommunications infrastructure. The same was the case for Puerto Rico in the aftermath of 
hurricane Maria (see case study on Puerto Rico’s response to the hurricane), and both 
territories experienced near black -out for extended periods of time. By co ntrast, Florida saw 
97% of cell sites back online within a week of the hurricane, which had initially caused 27% of these sites to go offline.

 6. Portfolio of Measures  and  Recommendations  
The private sector’s motivations to invest in resilience are driven by (i) economic incentives to 
reduce the risk of their investments by mitigatin g against climate risk; (ii) serving their client’s 
needs, adhering to Service Level Agreements, and upholding their reputation; and (iii) serving the 
interests of their area  of operation by providing a critical service during emergencies.31 This last 
motive ensures the public good provided by this privately -owned infrastructure, acknowledging 
its mission -critical nature for an economy.  
The importance of telecommunications infrastructure, particularly submarine cables and landing 
stations is  also increasingly highlighted in discussions around national security. In addition to 
action taken on cybersecurity and the protection of critical online infrastructure, the physical 
protection of the internet’s underlying infrastructure should also be a policy and industry -wide 
priority.  
The private sector, as owners of much of the infrastructure, will need to take the lead in investing 
in resilience of their assets, while the public sector plays the role of a facilitator and develops the right enabling environment for investment in resilience of critical infrastructures. The public 
sector’s policy leadership on climate resilience of critical infrastructures is necessary in driving actions across sectors, and fostering a holistic approach to climate adapt ation, resilience, and 
disaster recovery. Given below are some high -level recommendations for the building of greater 
resilience in global telecommunications infrastructure.  
1. Create awareness of climate risks to telecommunications infrastructure, and the  importance 
of the infrastructure ’s resilience to chronic and acute climatic events  
Literature on the topic of the climate resilience of ICT infrastructure highlights low levels of active discussion on the topic. With the intensity of severe climate events  increasing over time, 
infrastructure owners and policymakers need to focus attention on at -risk telecommunications 
infrastructure. Individual enterprises have taken the lead and made investments in infrastructure factoring in the impacts of climate change , and the needs of the infrastructure. Facebook’s 
decision to reduce cooling costs by developing a hyperscale datacenter in the Arctic circle with 
access to adequate cold water, is evidence of individual enterprises taking the lead in making the 
internet m ore resilient. However, there is limited awareness and dialog in the sector, and within 
countries, regarding the climate risk to ICT infrastructure.  
 
                                                                    
31 Biagini B., Miller, A . (2013), “Engaging the Private Sector in Adaptation to Climate Change in 
Developing Countries: Importance, Status and Challenges”, Climate and Development, Vol. 5, Issue 3, 
pages 242 -252 37 
 Public Sector Recommendations : 
• Conduct periodic infrastructure climate risk assessments and include 
telecommunications infrastructure as critical infrastructure for these assessments. 
Overall, a greater number of countries are conducting climate risk assessments for various sectors —sixteen G20 countries  have multi -sector national climate risk  assessments for 
infras tructure, as reported by OECD. However, only a limited number of countries 
conduct ICT and datacenter specific climate risk assessments.  While certain government s 
may have their own private  telecommunications networks , the importance of 
communications services to the economy and citizens today, means that assessing the vulnerability of privately -owned  networks is as important.  International connectivity, in 
particular submarine cables, takes priority in this respect  since  it can be a major choke 
point for countries with limited international connectivity.  Both public and private sector 
stakeholders should take a collaborative approach towards understanding the risks as well as efforts and investment involved in mitigating against them and building resilience 
in high -risk areas. Lessons from the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in New York and the 
2017 Atlantic hurricane season demonstrate the success of adopting a holistic approach 
to response and recovery. However, it is now necessary to extend these efforts to resilience as well and continue to move towards a proactive stance towards climate risks 
as opposed to reactive.  
• Conduct periodic private sector consultations  to understand concerns and challenges 
faced by the private sector and inform the development of an enabling environment that 
builds a business case for the private sector to invest in resilience and continuity of 
business. Additionally, the private sector  is also equipped to develop and adopt the latest 
innovations in infrastructure resilience, early warning, and recovery. Periodic consultations can help the government ensure these innovations have the necessary 
support to be deployed in emergencies.  
Private Sector Recommendations  
• Assess current climate exposure to assets  across the value chain and identify 
vulnerabilities. Telecommunication networks follow population centers, and 
vulnerabilities identified one operator can very often be shared by other op erators, or 
utilities. As a result, opportunities to share risks and costs may emerge, and have a 
positive impact on the business case for investment in infrastructure resilience.  
• Make institutional and private users aware of the steps being undertaken to make the 
infrastructure behind the services received by them more resilient. The datacenter 
industry uses security and safety certifications and audits to attract users and demand commensurate premiums. As greater awareness of the need for the resilience o f 
telecommunications infrastructure spreads, it can also be leveraged as a differentiating 
factor between operators.  38 
 2. Design and upgrade for resilience  
Lower asset cost , relatively shorter asset life, and rapid rate of technological change allow for 
frequent upgrades to telecommunications infrastructure. Additionally, generational change in 
telecommunication technology often requires replacement of legacy systems, such a s in the case 
of migration from metal cables to fiber optic cables for transmitting data. In both situations, as 
well as in the case of new asset deployments, infrastructure owners have an opportunity to assess 
and enhance resilience of the asset. The publ ic sector can also ensure each law, policy or 
regulation being drafted that may have an impact on network infrastructure, should factor in 
resilience investment facilitation related considerations.  
Public Sector Recommendations  
• Update policies, laws and re gulations that impact deployment of telecommunications 
infrastructure to include resilience building measures.  These measures may be included 
in areas such as building construction codes, asset specifications, and land categorization. 
In addition, the appl ication of international standards should be promoted in equipment, 
civil works, and network planning, inter alia. The public sector can also set benchmarks 
for the industry using standardized resilience requirements in the public procurement of 
connectivi ty and other digital services.  
• Standardize resilience enhancing elements in fully or partially publicly  funded 
infrastructure.  In the case of Nepal, the concerted efforts to strengthen middle mile 
networks using conduits and addressing vulnerabilities in t he years leading up to the 2015 
earthquake paid dividends as the middle mile infrastructure went largely unaffected. Last 
mile infrastructure —mostly aerial— was severely impacted.  
Private Sector Recommendations  
• Include climate risk in business cases and investment decisions made by owners of telecommunications infrastructure. Climate risks are being factored into the investment 
decisions of several  industries. The geographic spread and exposure of a lot of 
teleco mmunications infrastructure increases the risk, or reduces the lifespan, of 
investments made in the expansion of broadband networks, particularly with increased 
climate risks. Business cases in the telecommunications industry need to actively factor 
in climate -related risks, including those that may potentially arise later in the lifespan of 
the assets. All new network deployments, replacements and upgrades provide 
opportunities for the assessment of climate risk that can negatively impact returns on the 
investments, or increase risk, which in most cases is transferred to the users as a cost.  
• Upgrade to IP based communication: IP based communication allows for greater 
resilience by default because of  the technology itself.  
• Identify assets most at risk based  on climate risk assessments and  prioritize actions to 
enhance their resilience. Perform a cost benefit analysis of various climate -proofing 39 
 options  for the assets and develop a phased approach to resilience building. This can 
allow for better management o f working capital, and smoothen the need for resources 
used for enhancing resilience of infrastructure over time.  
3. Coordinate  actions  
While functioning as foundational infrastructure for all sectors of the economy, the 
telecommunications sector is itself highly dependent on energy, road transport, and in the case 
of datacenters, water. Interruptions to these critical infrastructures impacts the functioning of 
telecommunications infrastruc ture, as highlighted in various case studies in this chapter. During 
acute climate events, all these infrastructures are exposed and at risk simultaneously. The 
interdependencies between these sectors, and the roles they play in emergency response and 
reco very efforts, make it necessary to coordinate effectively between the various stakeholders. 
Governments , as the drivers of emergency response and recovery efforts, can benefit from taking 
a holistic approach to resilience, response and recovery, particularly in high -risk areas. Similarly, 
private sector stakeholders can save costs, strengthen their infrastructure, and increase returns on investments through greater and more effective coordination of infrastructure deployment, 
resilience investment, and reco very efforts.  
Public Sector Recommendations  
• Adopt a holistic approach to infrastructure resilience, disaster preparedness, 
emergency response, and recovery.  Such an approach should be focused on ensuring the 
greatest possible availability of critical infrastructures —transport, telecommunications, 
energy, and water. Sensitizing stakeholders involved in emergency response and recovery efforts to the various interdependencies and common pinch points can help reduce the 
impact of climate events on infrastructure and  make these efforts more effective. A 
coordinated strategy, with well- defined roles and procedures, can better utilize limited 
resources, and ensure the continued availability of interdependent infrastructure to limit the knock -on effects of its failu re. 
• Develop open data and information sharing platforms to enable sector stakeholders to 
effectively prepare for, and recover from, climate events.  In addition to sharing data, the 
various stakeholders can also share expertise. For example, the public sector may have 
access to localized hazard maps for climate risks, while operators have data on 
infrastructure locations, and back up resources at site s, but neither may have the human 
capital to analyze the data. This may come from a university or climate study institute 
that contributes to or has access to the platform.  
Private Sector Recommendations:  
• Build on existing collaborations among telecom oper ators, and between sectors, to 
reduce cost of network deployments and build the resilience of shared infrastructure.  40 
 A cost and risk sharing approach, while easily applicable to new shared deployments, such 
as ducts and conduits, can also be used to upgrad e existing shared infrastructure. With 
utilities such as electricity, water, gas and telecommunications often serving the same households, opportunities to co -invest in resilience building efforts can yield a greater 
rate of return of investment for all parties involved.  
• Extend the culture of co -operative competition in infrastructure among 
telecommunications operators to sharing data and disaster recovery resources.  There 
are many instances of mobile operators allowing free domestic roaming on their networks for subscribers of other operators in the aftermaths of disasters. Such efforts can be 
expanded to proactive collaboration in readiness, and the sharing of inves tment in 
recovery equipment. Leveraging each other’s ’ sites and locations across cities can help 
restore connectivity faster in the event of a natural disaster. Additionally, the private 
sector can greatly assist resilience, response and recovery efforts  
 
4. Mobilize financing for increased investment in infrastructure resilience  
Reconciling the need to increase affordability while investing in climate resilience is a big 
challenge for the sector, particularly given the public good provided by communicatio ns services, 
and their criticality to the global economy. While government communications networks may have adequate physical redundancy and  are not concerned with the financial viability of these 
investments, private sector operators often rely on commerc ial arrangements to build in 
redundancy into their networks. They need to pass on the cost of investments in resilience to the 
users of their services. With increased climate risk, the private and public sectors will need to 
mobilize investment to strength en existing networks, and ensure new deployments adhere to 
certain climate resilience standards.  
Public Sector Recommendations : 
• Provide viability gap funding for investments in resilience.  The public sector has used 
innovative models to support sector financing in the past, particularly to work towards extending access to connectivity in rural and remote areas. In such cases, viability gap 
financing  makes a viable business case for private sector investment in low -revenue areas 
of the country. Such programs  can also be used to finance viability gaps in 
telecommunications infrastructure resilience. Models such as reverse auction subsidies, 
public procurement of services to provide an anchor client to telecom service providers, 
and universal access funds have been utilized successfully across the world, and similar 
models can be devised to make investments in climate resilience of infrastructure more 
viable or include them in network deployment . 41 
 • Promote adoption of international standards for telecommunications  infrastructure . It 
may be necessary to support operators with economic incentives to adhere to the 
standards , undertake periodic audits and assessment  for compliance, and facilitate 
dispute resolution .  
Private Sector Recommendations : 
• Undertake periodic cost -benefit analysis of climate proofing exposed assets to make 
financial provisions  for resilience efforts . Additionally, due to the geographical spread 
and highly exposed nature of telecommunication assets, climate risk should  be included 
in operators’ contingency planning. These activities can help operators understand the 
scale of investments necessary to increase climate resilience of their infrastructure, and 
plan for them in a phased manner.  
• Monetize enhanced resilience and certifications , like the datacenter industry. While 
individual subscribers may not see the value in paying a premium for a more climate resilient network, institutional customers may see value in doing so from a continuity of 
business perspective. Enhanced resilience of infrastruc ture can also become a 
differentiator for operators in what is a very competitive sector.  
In conclusion, considering and investing in the resilience and recovery of global digital infrastructure should be a public and private sector priority. Given the dis tributed ownership and 
varied governance and operating models across the industry, there is a need for greater 
coordination of resilience and recovery efforts between the wide range of stakeholders in the 
sector. Reconciling the costs of increased investme nt in resilience, and the need to improving 
affordability of broadband services is a key consideration, particularly for the public sector. This 
may require targeted regulatory interventions to incentivize more resilient technology choices, 
network design, and infrastructure deployment/ upgrade, as well as measures that reduce the time and economic cost of investments. To undertake the above  actions, there is a need to create 
greater awareness and understanding of the impact of climate -related risks to digital 
infrastructure, and possible collaborative solutions that benefit all stakeholders —infrastructure 
owners, users, and g overnments.
