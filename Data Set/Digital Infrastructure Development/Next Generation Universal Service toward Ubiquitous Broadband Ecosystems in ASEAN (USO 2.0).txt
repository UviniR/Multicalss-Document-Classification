 1 1.0 Introduction  
This white paper addresses the goals of Universal Service Obligation (USO) policies 
on information and communication  technology ( ICT) development in countries of the 
ASEAN region. It presents background, discussion, ideas, and recommendations for 
establishing and updating USO policies for ASEAN Member States (AMS), to reflect 
changing condit ions and objectives in the regional and global ICT market s. The 
ultimate goal is to support the adoption by AMS of next -generation USO policies that 
will help drive universal broadband ICT ecosystem development throughout the 
region.  
The first draft of thi s white paper was the substantive foundation for a workshop 
conducted among AMS representatives in  March 2018 . This final revised white 
paper incorporates  the information and viewpoints at the  workshop in its findings and 
recommendations.  
The paper includes the following sections:  
 Section 2 provides background and context on the evolution of USO policies 
and practices worldwide  as well as  the scope of the broadband ICT 
ecosystem.  
 Section 3 addresses updating and enhancing Universal Service Funds  
(USF s), including the key features of USFs, challenges and opportunities for 
enhancing USF performance, and some key complementary and alternative 
approaches.  
 Section 4 describes objectives and options for ICT infrastructure and service 
programs, including backbone network infrastructure and mobile network 
access and service.  
 Section 5 describes objectives and options for community and institutional 
broadband access programs, including local fixed broadband access 
networks, community information centers, and institutional connectivity.  
 Section 6 describes objectives and options for ICT demand support and 
stimulation programs, including projects on ICT content and applications, 
digital literacy, and ICT affordability.  
 Section 7 focuses on the country reports pre sented at the March  2018  
workshop on USO policies for ASEAN, providing examples of innovative 
programs currently being implemented across the region

looking USO strategy for consider ation by ASEAN Member States while 
highlighting some of the key current trends  in ICT development  that a next 
generation USO policy should address.  
 Section 9 provides conclusions and recommendations for consideration by 
ASEAN.

 3 2.0 Background  
2.1 Evolution of USO Policies and Practices  
The goal of universal access to tele communications services has been a key 
element of national development policies for decades . Even in the earliest eras of 
telegraph and telephone networks, governments sought to enable access to services 
such as public utilities, through state -owned enterprises or regulatory measures.1  
The benefits of universal communications are widely understoo d. In pure economic 
terms, the “network externalities” that arise from expanding the base of users 
connected to such services ensure that increasing access results in greater overall 
value to all customers, suppliers, and society as a whole. From a social perspective, 
empowering citizens and communities to connect with each other, locally, nationally, 
and globally, magnifies the benefits of knowledge sharing and cultural integration 
immeasurably.  
As the global telecommunications industry grew, these objectives were typically 
addressed through internal industry cross -subsidies, mandated by governments and 
regulators. Telecom operators subsidized investment s in high  cost or low  revenue 
market segments with profits  from high  value segments  and wealthier customers . 
This model came to be known as the Universal Service Obligation (USO) policy, with 
the “obligation” resting with the monopoly or dominant national telecom providers. It 
was moderately successful in expandi ng basic telephone service s, but seldom 
approached achieving true “universal” service, especially in less developed 
economies. However, as technological advances reduced costs and broke down 
economic barriers to competition in telecommunications, th e model  of state control 
and internal cross -subsidy became unsustainable.   
The era of widespread and growing telecommunications competition, beginning in 
the late 1980s, brought rapid innovation and meteoric cost declines to the industry, 
which combined to fuel exponential growth in customer demand. These trends 
helped greatly to expand universal access to communication services, but also 
highlight ed the lingering gaps that remained, in both developed and especially less 
developed markets.  A new set of policies for promoting universal service in 
telecommunications was introduced in the 1990s and 2000s, focusing on Universal 
Service Funds , were set up to adapt the ongoing universality goals to these new 
market conditions.   (See section 3, below.)

 4 As technology and market conditions have continued to evolve, universal service 
goals and policies face challenges in trying to  keep pace with the needs of society 
and the economic and social trends driving the expanding ICT sector worldwide. 
Past goals of  providing access primarily to voice telephony —via public pay 
telephones in many towns and villages —soon gave way to the cellular mobile 
telephone revolution, with new objectives to make mobile signals universally 
available. As the internet and data commun ication ha ve come to dominate the global 
ICT market, universal service policies have also begun to adapt to demand for these 
new, highly valuable services and applications.  
Most recently, the growing prominence of high -speed broadband networks and 
services  has compelled policymakers to upgrade their universal service objectives 
yet again, now with focus on  universal broadband ICTs throughout society.2 
This vision requires understanding of the wide scope of factors that make up the 
broadband ICT “ecosystem,”  which all must be considered in defining policies to 
encourage effective, meaningful universal access to advanced broadband ICTs. The 
next section highlights these concepts.  
2.2 The Broadband ICT Ecosystem  
Effective access to broadband internet and mobile  services and applications involves 
an extensive set of interdependent elements, comparable to ecosystems in the 
natural world. Constructing networks and physical facilities is not enough . Whereas 
adoption of basic mobile (voice and text) telephon e has inv olved a relatively 
straightforward range of infrastructure investments and customer take-up, for 
broadband to achieve critical mass adoption all of the components of the ecosystem 
have to develop synergistically.   
This is what has happened over the past d ecade -plus in the most economically 
advanced markets, where the market foundations for the ecosystem’s evolution were 
already in place . But these prerequisites are largely absent in most under -developed 
economies, and especially among rural, low income, an d other disadvantaged 
populations.  
The main elements of the broadband ICT ecosystem are illustrated in the following 
diagram, which shows the key linkages and underlying influences that drive 
broadband growth and adoption:

These key components include:  
 End users: Humans (and even some “things” ) who connect to networks, use 
devices and applications, and share knowledge and information of every kind, 
across the world.  
 ICT devices :  Computers, smart phones, tablets, servers, local area networks, 
and a host of other devices that allow end users to connect to and access the 
ICT world.  
 Applications and content :  Software platform s, programs, mobile apps, 
websites, and other infinite information sources that represent the substantive 
value of ICTs.  
 Local access connectivity :  Wired and wireless telecom access networks that 
connect end user devices to voice and data services.  
 
ASEAN White Paper  
Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 6  Backbo ne transmission networks and facilities : National high -capacity 
transmission networks, typically fiber optic, linking major cities and carrying 
national voice and data traffic among core switching and interconnection 
facilities.  
 International connectivity : Links to international fiber cables , satellite 
netw orks, and internet exchange points that connect all global networks to 
each other.  
 Rural access : Network extensions into rural areas beyond the reach of main 
backbone and access network coverage, achieved  by a range of wired and 
wireless technologies.  
 Financial layer: The financial components of all ecosystem elements  including  
required capital investments and operating expenses, and the customer 
revenues that ultimately pay for them.  
 Policy layer: The legislation, national policies, regulatory framework, and all 
other public policy mandates that govern all of the various features of the 
ecosystem.  
 Human resource layer: The technicians, management, workers, and all other 
personnel involved in creating, d elivering, maintaining, and innovating at each 
level of ICT ecosystem development and operations.  
USO policies for broadband ICT development need to take into account all of these 
elements, address gaps in access, affordability, and user capabilities, and bring 
together suppliers, customers, and local and national officials to define 
comprehensive broadband development strategies.

 7 3.0 Funding Universal Service  
Achieving universal service in broadband ICTs depends upon many factors —
technological, political, and especially economic. Broadband telecommunications 
networks, services, devices, and applications, including all of the components 
describ ed above, are costly to produce and maintain. While the global ICT industry 
has demonstrat ed that such products can be very profitable in the marketplace, there 
are nevertheless many population and geographic segments where market forces 
alone cannot deliver broadband ICT services that are available and affordable to all.   
A central focus of u niversal service policies, therefore, is  how to ensure adequate 
funding will be made available to bring broadband ICTs to all geographic locations 
and populations.   This section addresses the funding side of USO policies, including 
the role of the market a nd approaches to evaluating and addressing access gaps, 
with emphasis on Universal Service Funds, along with discussion of some alternative 
mechanisms.  
3.1 Market Efficiency and Access Gaps  
By far the most extensive source of funding and investment in ICT resources is the 
private sector : the companies, operators, suppliers, and service providers that build 
and deliver these technologies around the world. Throughout the ICT revolution, 
market forces have been the primary driver s of increasing access, as well as 
technology upgrades and all types of innovations that have expanded the reach and 
value of these services. Private commercial market -based  incentives will continue to 
be the source of mo st ICT investments in all countries  and at all levels of economic 
development ; public policies must continue to enable and encourage such market -
driven growth.   
The goal of universal service policies is thus not to supersede or constrain these 
market forc es, but to complement them and reinforce them, only where necessary. 
One of the main challenges for such policies is to understand the distinction between 
market segments that can (and will) be served efficiently by the commercial sector , 
and those  segment s that require some form of public intervention. Market and 
access gap analysis  is a key framework for examining these distinctions .

Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 8 The diagram below illustrates this theoretical framework3: 
Figure 2. Market and Access Gap Analysi s Framework  
 
Source: ITU-infoDev ICT Regulation Toolkit , Chapter 4.1.3.3 Market Gaps and Universal Access Policy.  
The diagram represents a market or market segment, for example mobile broadband 
service in a given country.  It shows areas where there is currently service access, 
and those where access is not yet available.  Within the unserved areas, some 
locations are considered within the “ Market Efficiency Gap,” meaning that these are 
places where market forces should be able to expand profitably, with out subsidy.  
The “ Smart Subsidy Zone” (sometimes also known as the “Sustainability Frontier” 
shows where viable markets could be established with a one -time capital subsidy.  
The “True Access Gap” represents the least economically viable areas, where 
ongo ing subsidies would be needed to provide service.  
This framework provides a basis for designing USO policies to address the Access 
Gaps in broadband network and service coverage, while ensuring that market forces 
have the opportunity to expand as far as po ssible on their own.  
3.2 Updating and Enhancing Universal Service Funds  
This section discusses the role of Universal Service Funds  (USFs)  as a primary 
policy and funding mechanism for promoting universal service objectives. The 
discussions below highlight the range of issues and details involved in enhancing the

 9 role of USFs in ASEAN , and present options for updating and enhancing the role of 
USFs.  
Overview of USFs  
USFs have operat ed in dozens of countries, including nations in the ASEAN region, 
for many ye ars.4 Traditionally, these funds have served as a key mechanism for 
channeling funding from telecommunications industry sources and revenues (which 
have been earned from the most profitable market segments) toward subsidizing the 
build out  of infrastructur e and services in marginal, rural, and remote locations.  
The USF model has different characteristics in different countries, and a range of 
approaches have been introduced over the years. However, certain basic features 
are typically found in most USFs in the developing world, including in ASEAN  
countries . These generally include the following:  
 Collect  mandatory contributions from licensed telecom operators into a 
common Fund , typically in the range of 2  percent  to 5 percent  of gross 
operator revenues . 
 Identify gaps in access to ICTs and other priority needs that are not being 
served by the commercial market .  
 Allocate USF resources toward subsidizing projects that will close the 
identified gaps . 
 Conduct competitive bidding processes among qualified firms to receive the 
subsidies and undertake the defined projects.  
 Monitor and evaluate the effectiveness and impact of USF projects, and 
overall progress toward achieving fund objectives.  
The i nstituti onal structure and operational models of USFs also differ across 
countries. In some cases , the funds are managed by a unit within the national 
telecom regulatory agency , or even a government  ministry. In others, a separate 
organization is established, with  semi -autonomous authority to collect and manage 
the USF. The mandate, rules of procedure,  and functional roles and tasks of these 
operations vary considerably, and these structures can have a significant impact on 
the fund’s success.5

 10 The focus of activi ty for most of the earliest models of USFs involved construction of 
public fixed (voice) telephone facilities in unserved villages —often linked via satellite 
connections  and providing just a single basic communication lifeline to each local 
community.  
As the telecom industry has continued to evolve, USF models and experiences have 
changed as well in many countries. Most fund policies have shifted away from basic 
public telephone service toward more expansive objectives  related to the wider 
broadband ecosyst em.6 Many USFs have turned from fixed service to promoting 
increas ed mobile phone coverage, often including mobile data services . Others have 
invested directly , expanding broadband network infrastructure  including fiber 
backbone networks. Many support  public access to fixed internet  services, via 
community internet centers or other facilities . In some cases, USFs also help 
connect schools and health clinics via broadband internet . Most recently, some 
USFs  have been  also looking into promoting ICT deman d stimulation  through  
various new types of programs.  Sections 4, 5, and 6 of this white p aper address the 
range of potential USF and related USO policies  and programs .  
Criticisms of USF performance  
Many USFs have around the world have demonstrated the vi ability of th e approach  
described above  in coordinating and channeling resources toward expanding access 
to telecommunications networks and services, including broadband ICTs. However, 
there have also been cases in which USFs have performed below expectati ons, 
whether by failing to establish and organize the fund, collecting money but not 
spending it effectively, or by investing in unsuccessful or inefficient projects. 
Addressing these challenges should  be a central objective for ASEAN officials, to 
ensure they take advantage of the opportunities that USFs can provide.  
Criticism s of USFs has come primarily from the telecom industry operators that are 
mostly responsible for contributing to the funds from their revenues. These operators 
would often prefer not to have to pay into such funds, or at least to be confident that 
the money is well spent on projects that will benefit them. Other criticisms have come 
from governments, local communities, an d other stakeholders when a USF does not 
deliver the ICT infrastructure and services it has been created to provide.  
Some of the specific types of shortcomings identified by USF critics , such as the 
GSMA7, which represents mobile operators,  have included t he following:

 11  USF framework and rules  that do not support or permit use of the funds for 
the services required (e.g., wireless, broadband)  
 Inadequate or misguided articulation of fund strategy and objectives that 
imped e effective administration  
 Local condi tions that impede or endanger the full deployment of approved 
projects  
 The a bsence of adequate primary infrastructure and facilities , thus  imped ing 
or preclud ing project deployment (e.g., accessible transmission backbone)  
 Inefficient or excessively complex  decision making, approval and governance 
processes  
 Inadequate skill levels available for rural rollout , ongoing maintenance,  and 
sustainability  
 Structural flaws in setting up the fund and its relationship with the various 
other institutional bodies involv ed in oversight or policy making  
 Lack of qualified and/or interested vendors to bid on USF projects  
 General managerial, operational , and capacity issues.  
Enhancing USF institutional planning and operations  
Establishing and operating an effective USF requir es a number of key steps and 
decisions, and the development of an institutional framework and practices that 
ensure appropriate use of the funds collected. The following diagram highlights the 
main areas of focus that any USF should address to optimize per formance. There 
are a variety of approaches and details to be determined under each item.

For a USF to be most productive in meeting Universal Service goals, and 
overcoming some of the criticisms listed above, it must effectively define and 
implement each of these components . Briefly, the main elements to address include:  
 USF policy, legislatio n: The government must adopt the basic enabling 
statutes and policies that define the fund’s authority and mandate.  
 Institutional framework : The fund must have a clear institutional structure, 
whether as a department within the regulator, as a separate agency, or using 
an alternative framework. The role and authority of the USF body must be 
clearly defined , including the membership of its board of directors.  
 Organizational plan, operating procedures : The USF governing board and 
management shou ld define all key internal structures and rules relating to the 
fund’s operations. Clear roles and functions for fund’s administration must be 
established, and specific responsibilities should be agreed for how the fund 
will operate.  
 Collections, budget, accounting : Processes for collecting mandatory 
contributions (and other income) must be established, with transparent and 
independent accounting procedures and budgets. Regular audits must be 
conducted and made available to the public.  
 
ASEAN White Paper  
Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 13  Market assessment, gap analysis : The fund’s administration should conduct 
periodic reviews of ICT market status, including an access gap analysis to 
identify changing market conditions and areas of greatest need, as well as to 
support budgeting and strategic planning.  
 Strategi c plan: The fund’s management and board should develop a long -term 
(4–5 year) strategy for how the USF will be used, its objectives and targets, 
and priority programs and projects. This  strategy  should be developed with 
stakeholder input.  
 Operating plans: Fund management must develop annual operating plans 
based on the strategy, to lay out the scope of projects, budgets, and targets 
for each fiscal year. Such plans should describe the anticipated projects to be 
undertaken, with timing and milestones, to all ow interested contractors to plan 
accordingly.  
 Project design, award, and i mplementation : There must be clear and 
consistent procedures for designing projects to be financed by the fund. They 
should also be  consistent with the overall objectives and strate gy. Project 
design should take account of stakeholder input, from both suppliers and end 
users. Processes for awarding contracts on a transparent and competitively 
neutral basis should be defined. Project implementation requirements should 
be clear and lin ked to defined milestones and outcomes.  
 Monitoring and evaluation : The fund must have a comprehensive and well-
designed  monitoring and evaluation policy, to support ongoing review of USF 
projects, the compliance of implementing contractors, and the impacts  and 
effectiveness of all USF programs over time.   
Key USF issues  
ASEAN Member States  that have  active USF operations or are considering 
establishing or modifying such funds, should address  several key issues. The 
following are some of the most significant:   
 How should the fund be organized, structured, and managed?  
The institutional and organizational framework  of the USF  will play a critical 
role in determining the success of the fund. There must be sufficient authority 
and au tonomy to manage the fund and make key decisions without undue 
political interference. The organization must have sufficient personnel and 
internal resources to perform its functions efficiently. These requirements are 
needed regardless of whether the fund is a stand -alone agency or a 
department within the regulator or another body.   
ASEAN White Paper  
Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 14  What levels of contributions should be required , and by which industry 
players?  
Decisions on contributions must be clearly determined in law and policy,  and 
must be made  on an e quitable basis. Traditional ly, USFs have mainly 
collected a small percentage of major licensed telecom operator revenue s. 
Recent debates have suggested expanding the sources of contributions, for 
example to include unlicensed over-the-top (OTT) providers (such as Viber 
and WhatsApp), which benefit from universal (data) service. Other 
contributors sometimes include internet service provider s, broadcasters, and 
other types of technology companies. The levels of funding and market 
fairness derived from such wider sources must be weighed against the 
political and practical challenges of expanding the fund’s pool of contributions.  
 What should be the priority objectives of the USF, and what types of projects 
should be financed ? 
Traditional USFs  have primarily focused on subsidizing telecommunications 
network infrastructure build -out in rural areas, including both fixed and mobile 
telephone networks. In the context of the broadband ICT ecosystem, USF 
objectives and project scope s may be expanded to include demand -side 
projects as well, such as digital literacy programs, development of 
applications and content, and contributions to e -learning and e -health 
initiatives, among others. Fund resources are , by definition,  limited, however, 
and other sour ces and partners should be involved in planning and supporting 
many of these newer activities.  
 What entities should be eligible to receive funding ? 
As the scope of USF objectives and projects widens, the funds may also look 
to expand the range of firms and  organizations that can receive  USF funding, 
especially for non -telecom infrastructure projects. The decision to award funds 
to entities that do not contribute  to the Fund can be controversial, and the 
USF must seek to ensure transparency and fairness, while continuing to 
allocate the bulk of resources toward contributing firms.  
 How can the USF administration best ensure transparent, equitable, and 
effective use of its resources?  
It is vital that USFs  establish  a reputation for credibility, transparency,  and 
fairness, as well as demonstrating the value of the fund’s activities. They must 
adopt clear and consistent procedures , follow public consultations  on major 
decisions , issue reports  on all activities , maintain public web site s with access 
to all perti nent fund information , and conduct regular and transparent 
monitoring and evaluation of fund projects.   
ASEAN White Paper  
Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 15 3.3 Complementary and Alternative Funding Approaches  
USF policies can be augmented or substituted by other mechanisms to help finance 
ICT development goals. In most countries, some combination of the practices below 
have been followed to varying degrees . As USFs are expanded and enhanced, 
ASEAN Member States  should also revisit these approaches, to help construct the 
most effective policy framework for expanding access to the broadband ICT 
ecosystem.  
Rollout  obligations and pay-or-play 
These two options for funding telecommunications network infrastructure an d related 
investments are related, although they involve somewhat different roles and 
responsibilities.  The basic concepts are as follows:  
 Rollout  obligations : As a condition of being granted a license, telecom 
operators are often required to build and op erate networks in designated 
areas that might otherwise be commercially unattractive (i.e., within the 
economic access gap). These obligations may be defined at the time a 
license is granted, or at renewal. The net cost of such mandatory 
(unprofitable) net work rollouts is borne by the operator directly, as a form of 
in-kind license fee.  The Philippines , among other ASEAN countries, 
introduced a system of such mandatory network deployment as part of its 
competitive market policies.  
 Pay-or-play:  Some USF po licies allow for operators to choose between 
paying their mandatory contribution to the fund, or “playing” by directly 
building and operating networks and services in designated universal service 
areas. The net cost of these “play” projects should be equiv alent to the 
amount of contribution that the operator would otherwise be required to pay 
into the fund.   
 
Cambodia ’s new USO policy allows for this option, at least during the first 
year of the program and Fund’s operations. Operators may select designate d 
universal service areas to deploy networks directly, and may apply for an 
offset of their USF contribution requirement based on the cost, up to 50  
percent  of that obligation.  
Both approaches are based on the principle of allowing operators to invest directly in 
network development, without involving USF project design and procurement 
processes.  There are several key challenges involved in effectively implementing 
such policies , such as:   
ASEAN White Paper  
Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 16  The locations to be covered by “play” or rollout projects need to  be defined 
clearly, and must be within the economic access gap, not areas that the 
operator would build of its own accord.  
 The net cost of the investment incurred by the operator must be reasonably 
measured in relation to the level of required contributio n or the value of the 
license.  
 Operator compliance with these obligations must be monitored and enforced, 
to avoid incomplete  build out  or undue changes to agreed project 
requirements.  
These and similar challenges require analysis and oversight of operator  network 
projects comparable to what is needed to manage conventional USF operations. If 
such capacity and procedures can be well established, then rollout obligations and 
pay-or-play methods can , in principle , be adopted as one potentially efficient 
compo nent of universal service policy.  
Public -private  partnerships  
In a typical public-private partnership (PPP), the government engages a special 
purpose vehicle (SPV) to design, build, maintain , and operate a facility that is 
required to deliver specified ser vices, paid for through  user charges from direct users 
(and/or availability payments from the government), conditional on meeting specific 
key performance indicators  (KPIs) . 
PPPs cover agreements between a government and one or more private partners, 
for the private partner (s) to deliver an agreed quantity and quality of service, in return 
for a charge paid by the government and/or by the direct recipients of the service.  
The private partners are usually responsible for both the construction and operation  
phases. Some degree of risk sharing between the public and private partners is 
determined on the basis of which party is best able to manage each risk.

PPP for universal service : The PPP concept can also be applied to provide universal 
ICT services. In this case , the SPV must  be provided with some kind of an 
operational license. The government’s role can be performed by the USF 
organi zation, or it can be handled under some related program .

In Palapa Ring project , the private SPV is responsible for the financing, construction, 
operation , and maintenance  necessary to make  the fiber o ptic cabl es available for 
network users. The public service agency , BP3TI , under the  Ministry of 
Communication and Information Technology Indonesia  is responsible for making 
periodic subsidy payments to the SPV.

Since the Palapa Ring PPP is an ICT project which operates in a challenging area 
with a limited number of potential users, it is also covered by a guarantee agreement 
with the Indonesia Infrastructure Guarantee Fu nd (IIGF).9 In a deviation from the

case there is not enough demand, the risk is that of BP3TI.  
Another example is  India’s National Optic Fiber Network (now called BharatNet) . It is 
also a kind  of PPP, for which Bharat Broadband Network Limited (BBNL) was 
incorporated under the Companies Law to act as an SPV, and the funding is 
provided by Universal Service Obligation Fund ( USOF ).

 20 4.0 ICT Infrastructure and Service 
Programs   
The most widespread types of USO programs and projects have been, and continue 
to be, those that  support the build -out of telecommunications and ICT infrastructure 
and networks, and those that provide retail telecom services for unserved and 
underserved areas and populations. While the scope of such infrastructure and 
service projects has evolved, the overwhelming bulk of USF budgets and related 
initiatives should continue to be allocated to these supp ly-side programs, wherever 
needed, until true universal coverage of such networks is achieved. In this context, 
the two main types of programs tend to involve (1) backbone network infrastructure, 
and (2) mobile telephone networks and services. The key objectives and options  that 
projects in each category should address are described below.  
4.1 Backbone  Network Infrastructure  
In most countries , telecommunications operators have difficulty connecting rural 
regions to national networks, due to cost, terrain, p opulation density, and other 
concerns. While satellite and microwave transmission s can provide coverage in 
some cases, the y are often not cost -effective.  In the context of universal broadband 
ICT development, it is vital to link all regions via high capacity, high -speed backbone 
network connections, to support robust local and national access and data 
transmission requirement s.   
This typically calls for  the installation of fiber o ptic backbone networks, including 
international and domestic /intercity links, and extensions of fiber access connections 
into regional and rural centers. USO projects can be established where the cos ts and 
logistics of creating such fiber backbone infrastructure are unappealing to 
commercial operators and investors.  The Indonesia Palapa Ring project, referenced 
above, is a prominent example of this type of infrastructure initiative.  
Objectives : 
The ma in objectives of backbone network infrastructure USO projects include:  
 Extending backbone network links to rural, unserved regions, providing 
regional points -of-presence to support local broadband network access.  
 Creating backhaul capacity to enable retail  telecom operators to provide local 
services cost -effectively.   
ASEAN White Paper  
Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 21  Integrating the country geographically and economically, especially the most 
remote and outlying areas.  
 Improving quality and decreasing costs for national telecom transmission 
services . 
Projec t options : 
USO projects to support backbone network development can take several forms , 
and they can be implemented individually or as part of larger infrastructure and 
service programs. Some of the most prominent options include the f ollowing:  
 Competitive  subsid ies for private wholesale operators to install new backbone 
network; the network can be established regionally, in segments, or nationally.  
 Public -private  partnership arrangements, with government co -financing and 
co-ownership of infrastructure assets, and participation by one or multiple 
operators in structured joint venture.  
 Coordination of the backbone infrastructure with the rollout of the mobile 
network ; in this arrangement,  mobile operators develop backbone  
infrastructure  in collaboration with wholesale operators.  
 Coordination of backbone infrastructure with related rural infrastructure 
projects, (e.g., roads and power ); alignment of public and private investments 
across sectors ( e.g., the “dig once” policy).    
4.2 Mobile Network  Access and Service  
As mobile voice and data services have come to dominate the world ICT market, 
most countries have shifted their USO policies to emphasize universal access to 
mobile telephony. With the increasing focus on broadband services, this emphasis 
has recently begun to encompass not only traditional basic mobile service (voice and 
text), but also high speed mobile data services: at least 3G network quality or higher.   
USO projects that address such goals have most often involved subsidizing the 
construction of cell towers and the installation or upgrad ing of base stations in 
unserved and underserved areas, usually by one of the existing licensed mobile 
network operators  (MNOs).  Some innovative projects have created incentives for 
smaller rural operators to pursue newer technologies and business models that may 
be better suited to rural environments and customers. The programs implemented 
under the Digital Thailand objec tives of the Thailand USF, for example, include an 
emphasis on affordable and scalable rural technologies (see section  7 below ). The 
key purpose of such projects must be to bring the benefits and opportunities of 
broadband mobile communications to populati ons who have not yet had this type of 
access.     
ASEAN White Paper  
Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 22 Objectives : 
The general objectives of broadband mobile network and service USO projects are, 
as stated above, to provide mobile service coverage in previously unserved and 
underserved areas.  S ome of the s pecific objectives that should typicall y be part of  
such projects include:  
 Install new mobile towers, base stations, and other network infrastructure in 
locations where mobile signals are unavailable.  
 Upgrade and enhance mobile network equipment and services to provide 3G+ 
broadband data services to all covered populations.  
 Establish sufficient transmission and backhaul capacity to support broadband 
mobile data services in all communities receiving service.  
 Coordinate among local communities, official s, operators, and stakeholders to 
build sustainable local infrastructure and markets.  
 Ensure the availability of all relevant mobile data service features  and 
functions  at affordable prices.   
Project Options : 
Projects that focus on providing mobile networ k coverage and service may be 
implemented  via a number of approaches, with multiple options for how operators 
may deliver service, their obligations and business models.  Some of the key 
components that should be incorporated in such projects include as fo llows:  
 The USF may design requests for proposals ( RFPs ) for qualified licensed 
mobile operators to bid for contracts to develop networks and provide services 
in identified unserved areas.  Some projects may also be designed to support 
upgrade of existing 2 G sites, typically within the same region as new network 
projects.   
 Service locations should be only those where it is determined that mobile 
service would not be commercially viable without subsidy.  
 All terms and conditions should be included in project RFPs, which should 
define locations and service obligations, including competitive open access to 
all infrastructure built with USF subsidies.  
 Successful bidders can be determined by selecting the operator requesting 
the lowest subsidy to provide the requi red service. Alternatively, the contract 
may be awarded to the operator offering to deliver the greatest service 
coverage for a fixed subsidy amount.   
ASEAN White Paper  
Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 23  Funding budgets may cover Capital Expenditure (CapEx) only, or a 
combination of CapEx and Operational Expe nses (OpEx) for projects that 
may not be sustainable in the short -term. The long -term goal for such 
projects, however, should be commercial sustainability wherever possible.  
 Projects may also require the installation of necessary electrical power 
infrastru cture or facilities, such as solar panels, to support the services. Other 
infrastructure may also be included, such as roads. These inputs should also 
be made available for general public use where possible.  
 Projects may permit or encourage the use of innovative, low -cost technology 
options, to ensure more cost -effective delivery and encourage 
experimentation by qualified operators. In general, however, project bidding 
requirements should be outp ut-based and technology -neutral .

 24 5.0 Com munity  and Institutional 
Broadband Access  Programs  
Although broadband mobile data services can provide extensive benefits to 
individuals and even some organizations and businesses, many potential users have 
more robust demand for broadband ICTs. The most e ffective solution for collective, 
larger -scale demand settings —such as schools, government offices, and public 
institutions, as well as public access facilities —is to deliver fixed broadband network 
access  through  wired or wireless technologies.   
Therefor e, one significant set of USO program option s involve s support for bringing 
high capacity broadband network connections into certain communities, and 
deliver ing such fixed broadband access to key locations. This type of  program can 
also be combined with of fering both public mobile data services and community 
access points once the capacity is in place. These programs can also be linked with 
demand -side in itiatives such as content development and capacity building, as 
addressed in section 6 below.  
The follow ing subsections describe the objectives and options for three key types of 
programs in this area: Local Fixed Broadband Access Networks, Community 
Information Centers, and Institutional Connectivity.  These can be developed 
individually, or often in combin ation to take advantage of synergies and economies in 
local broadband network and service delivery.  
5.1 Local Fixed Broadband Access Networks  
Projects of this nature involve e xtending high-capacity network links into unserved 
areas , to allow for community -wide broadband access.  Local contracting operators 
receive subsidy support to e stablish publicly available retail fixed broadband 
communication services within each community, for purchase and use by local 
citizens, enterprises, a nd other customers.   This type of project should generally only 
be implemented in parallel with public community access and/or institutional 
connectivity projects (see below), to take advantage of the shared infrastructure.   
Several ASEAN countries (e.g., Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Viet Nam ) have 
included broadband access connectivity within their Universal Service programs, as 
identified in section  7 below .  
ASEAN White Paper  
Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 25 Objectives  
There are several related elements to projects in this category, whose combined 
objective is to make available high quality fixed broadband networks and services in 
key unserved communities, typically starting with more populous regional district 
centers. These elements are:  
 Extension of the national fiber optic backbone network deeper  into remote , 
unserved regions : Construction of  fiber o ptic backbone infrastructure links 
along designated routes from existing nodes along new routes, into regional 
centers not currently on the backbone. These extensions create new 
backbone nodes that are  directly connected to the national fiber backbone.  
 Establishment of local broadband access network connections : Construction 
of last-mile broadband points -of-presence within each designated local 
community within a region, connecting to  the new backbone nodes.  These 
may be fiber optic, but they may also employ other broadband access 
technologies, such as TV White Space, as long as they deliver adequate 
capacity to meet all anticipated usage and speed requirements within the 
community. In som e areas, satellite transmission may be u sed; this  would 
replace both the backbone extension and local access, where cost -effective.  
 Provision of public broadband communication services : Operation and 
provision of end -user public broadband service to subscr ibers in the target 
communities, including all voice, internet, and related service options 
(potentially including television as well). Such services should be available 
throughout the community, to allow connection of households, businesses, 
and other loc ations, at affordable prices.  
Project Options  
Such local broadband network projects can be implemented according to a range of 
business models, depending on the size and scope of each project, the involvement 
of local communities, and the interests of vari ous stakeholders from operators to end 
users. The USF or government partners should provide sufficient funding to ensure 
the viability of the network and services. Various components may be delivered 
separately or in combination. Key options include:  
 Proje cts can be provided by a single contractor in each area, with 
responsibility to build all infrastructure, install local equipment and facilities, 
connect customers , and provide service. Terms and conditions would be 
determined by the contract and overseen by the USF.  
ASEAN White Paper  
Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 26  Alternatively, there c an be two or more separate contracts, for building 
infrastructure and for providing end -user services. A prime contractor could 
also be engaged, with identified service providers as subcontractors.  
 In some cases, a project  may involve a joint arrangement between the local 
community and the contracting operator, whereby the operator builds and 
maintains the network, providing wholesale access service, while a local entity 
is given responsibility for mana ging and sell ing public services. Such 
conditions can be adopted where there is sufficient capacity and willingness at 
the local level.   
 While the main backbone extensions should be fiber optic, the local access 
links can be t echnology neutral  and open to experimentation with alternative 
technologies. Project terms of reference should permit and encourage 
different technical solutions as long as they provide the necessary 
connectivity and capacity.   
 Local broadband network projects should mandate open access  to these 
networks for competing operators and service providers, under 
nondiscriminatory terms, conditions, and pricing.  
 The local access network must also incorporate an electricity power source of 
sufficient energy to support continuous operation, as we ll as adequate backup 
energy supply.  
 Prices for services should be largely based on commercial market conditions, 
but there should be certain low -cost “basic” service options that will make it 
affordable for any user to obtain entry -level broadband connect ivity.  
5.2 Community ICT Center s (CICs)  
This type of program involves establishment of public access community ICT centers 
(CICs) within local areas , to provide community -wide access to full -service ICTs at 
publicly available locations. The CICs are to be  connected to the local broadband 
network, making internet access, computers, ICT services, and training available to 
all local citizens.  In ASEAN, Malaysia’s Community Broadband Centers (CBCs) , and 
the Tech4Ed Centers in the Philippines  are among the most  successful examples of 
such facilities  (see section  7.) 
Objectives  
A CIC is a public location that provides a combination of facilities and services, to 
enable public access to a broad range of ICT resources. The overall objective of CIC 
programs is to cr eate sustainable local services that contribute to local econom ic and  
ASEAN White Paper  
Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 27 social opportunities  and expand the role and impact of ICTs in people’s lives. The 
nature and structure of CIC operations can vary significantly, but they should ideally 
provide a core set of technical and support resources, such as:  
 Broadband connectivity at a conveniently locat ed public building or facility, 
which may be affiliated with a library, post office, public center, or school 
campus, or may be a stand -alone location.  
 A rich selection of equipment, including good quality computers, possibly 
available tablets and smart phones, printers, fax and photocopy machines, 
server s and router s, etc.  
 Appropriate software platforms and packages, tailored to local needs, such as 
language, literacy, and special needs, along with customized web portals and 
applications to facilitate ac cess to the most relevant and valuable on -line 
content. CICs may also provide web and mail hosting services for their users.   
 Trained management and staff, available to provide technical assistance, and 
to offer training classes in basic computer skills, as well as  ICT 
entrepreneurship and business applications for small and medium 
enterprises.  
 In addition, CICs can provide public internet access through external Wi-Fi 
signals from transmitters based in the CIC and/or linked to other locations, 
allowing use rs with Wi-Fi-enabled devices to access broadband signals in 
public places.  
Project Options  
CICs and similar types of public ICT access facilities have been established in 
numerous countries  using  a wide range of designs and operational models. Many 
differ ent approaches have proven successful, although some have failed to achieve 
sustainable and effective results. It is not necessary to define a single set of 
standards for ASEAN countries, or even within one country, as different CIC models 
can be applied t o different purposes or locations. The options below highlight some 
of the best practices, which should be considered in development or enhancement of 
CIC programs:  
 CIC construction, equipment, and installation  involves the physical creation of 
the CIC, including procurement and installation of necessary equipment, 
configuration and other technical setup, connection to the local broadband 
access network, and any other start -up requirements. This stage may be 
undertaken by a technical supply firm  under a master C IC contract.   
ASEAN White Paper  
Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 28  Each CIC should have a minimum required configuration of available 
technology , including computers, broadband network connections, servers 
and routers, software platforms and applications, an d related equipment and 
capabilities, specified in detail for each mandatory service location within each 
project’s terms of reference . The size and scope of CIC installations may vary 
by location, according to population, demographics, geography, or other  
factors. In each case, however, the facility must be adequate to allow robust 
access to broadband ICTs for the local community.  
 The location and housing for the CIC  must be decided by USF management 
and local officials, so as to ensur e that a publicly acc essible and secure 
facility  is created with clear  ownership and stability. Project financing may 
cover the costs of building and/or renovating the appropriate space, as 
needed.  
 The network connection  (standalone  vs. part of infrastructure project ) is also 
important : The broadband connections to the CIC may be linked to network 
access point s within each community, potentially developed under parallel 
local broadband access projects. The capacity of the connection to the CIC 
must be sufficient to allow for si multaneous peak use of all its stations, while 
retaining adequate extra capacity for outside Wi-Fi connections as well.  
 CIC operation , management  and maintenance , should be conducted  by 
designated staff engaged or arranged by the prime CIC contractor under  
agreement with the USF. These workers should be responsible for assisting 
customers, managing finances and accounts, maintaining hardware and 
software, providing training classes and general technical assistance, and 
overseeing all other CIC operations.  
 CIC management may, alternatively, be under the responsibility of local 
government or  officials  from a nongovernmental organization , via a separate 
contract or partnership agreement. In either case, CIC staff should be 
recruited from among the local communi ty population, and receive  adequate 
training to conduct these jobs.  
5.3 Institutional Connectivity  
Programs in this category address the broadband connectivity needs of multiple 
different types of public institutions. Projects may be designed to support broadband 
connectivity and related ICT resources for university campuses, secondary schools, 
health facilities, public librarie s, and emergency response agencies, among others. 
Projects of this type should be developed in close collaboration with relevant 
government m inistry and other national and local officials , under an appropriate  
ASEAN White Paper  
Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 29 memorandum of understanding (M OU) with each pa rtner.  Connections to schools 
are among the priorities in several ASEAN countries, such as the Philippines and 
Thailand.  
Objectives  
The objectives of institutional connectivity are complex and largely depend upon the 
needs of each institution. In general, these projects should seek to align technology 
deployment with the core mission and functional roles of each partner. Key 
provisions of the project plans and agreements should include:  
 Construction and operation of direct broadband links to designated 
institutional sites, such as university campuses, schools, hospitals, libraries, 
and government buildings. These may be in rural areas or in urban locations 
that are unserved.  
 Funding , as appropriate,  for ICT equipment, software, and other resources at 
connect ion sites, according to agreed terms with partner agencies.  
 Support for training and technical assistance for implementing partners in the 
implementation, use, and management of ICT resources.  
 Contractors should provide both network connections and broadb and internet 
service at designated sites, including design, installation, configuration of 
network connections, and device setup, software installation, and technical 
support.  
 Prices for ongoing ICT services should be determined in advance under an 
agreed formula, to be paid either by the institutional partner alone, or with 
some continued financing from the USF.  
Project Options  
Options for developing projects under this type of program are twofold , addressing  
(1) the scope and nature of institutions to be connected, and (2) the mechanisms 
and organizational arrangements for implementing the projects. Alternatives for each 
category are highlighted below . 
Institutions  
Priority public institution connections include:  
 Educational : All local public schools, university campuses, teachers ’ colleges, 
as well as administrative offices. Specific requirements for internal networks,

 30 facilities, and equipment should be determined in collaboration with the 
ministry of education.  
 Health facilities : All local hospitals and health clinics within the community. 
Technical equipment and facilities to enable these organizations to u se their 
broadband connections should be provided in collaboration with the ministry 
of health.  
 Local government offices : Local government office buildings and annexes, 
including security agencies such as police, fire, and emergency  response . 
Locations may also include premises of local community organizations, as 
well as shared facilities that may house relevant public administration 
activities.   
 Agricultural centers: Facilities to support local farmers and community 
agricultural development.  
 Public libraries and post offices : Where such facilities exist, broadband 
connections and public access to personal computer s and internet service 
can be inst alled on a cooperative basis.  
Implementation  
Key features of project implementation include the following:  
 The USF should develop separate M OUs with partner ministries to determine 
the scope of each project.  
 The required locations should be identified duri ng each project’s planning 
phase, including geographic areas, size and nature of facilities, and timing of 
network expansion.  
 Connections to each institution must provide adequate bandwidth to allow for 
the minimum level of projected network usage in each location. The 
implementing contractor will be responsible for determining the most 
appropriate access technology and configurations.  
 The contractor may also be required to install specified internal facilities and 
equipment at each location (e.g., a local area network, server, firewall, etc.) . 
 The contractor or its affiliate will also be responsible for providing ongoing 
service delivery to all connected institutions, according to agreed pricing, 
terms, and conditions (to be negotiated as part of project pl anning and 
implementation).  The contractor should be required to provide comprehensive

 32 6.0 ICT Demand Support and 
Stimulation Programs  
For USO programs to promote the full adoption of the broadband ecosystem 
nationwide, there must be a  clear and concerted  focus on the demand side of the 
ICT market. Those citizens, entrepreneurs, and communities that have to date been 
excluded from the digital revolution may not have the r esources and capacity to 
utilize, or even afford, ICT services.   
The impacts of demand support and stimulation projects are twofold . They help new 
users and communities to get the most benefit out of advanced ICTs, and by 
increasing local service demand i n USO areas, they help generate higher revenues 
for ICT operators and other suppliers. Together, these effects can enhance the 
commercial viability of rural and marginal markets, growing the overall national ICT 
sector.  
Also note that some objectives may b e more global in nature, in order to be 
consistent with emerging standards on the international level. Most recently, when 
the United Nations Broadband Commission updated its objectives for broadband 
adoption, it included several specific targets for indic ators of broadband ICT demand. 
These are goals that every country is now encouraged to adopt as official policy . 
The subsections below describe three main categories of demand support and 
stimulation programs: ICT applications and content; digital literacy ; and affordability.  
Each of these represents an important set of tools for reinforcing the development of 
universal broadband ICT ecosystem.  
6.1 ICT Applications  and Content  Development  
The most significant effect of the shift of ICTs from voice/text to broadband data 
services has been the explosion of information content and innovative applications 
that are available to users via the internet and smart devices. For many populations, 
howe ver, including rural indigenous people, those speaking only traditional 
languages, and new users unfamiliar with technology, this wealth of online content 
may not be easily available or usable . 
Some USO programs are now seek ing to support the growing need for diversified 
ICT applications and content by helping to fund development initiatives, from local 
and community sources to educational programs and ICT entrepreneurs. This is 
potentially the fastest growing segment of the ICT development sector, and  
ASEAN White Paper  
Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 33 restructured USO policies can play a key role in accelerating these trends.  In 
ASEAN, several countries , such as in Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines,  have 
incorporated support for content development within ICT centers and under 
education access policie s.  
Objectives : 
The objectives behind projects promoting ICT applications and content include 
elements focusing on both the information that such projects will make available, as 
well as the processes, skills, and business models involved in creating these  
information products. The end goal is to build up local, indigenous sources of 
information , and locally relevant and useful applications, in a manner that helps 
establish a viable domestic technology and knowledge sector , while also increasing 
overall mar ket demand for ICTs . The general objectives of USO projects in this area 
therefore include:  
 Expanding the availability of relevant, valuable, and commercially successful 
applications developed for and by citizens and businesses within each 
country.  
 Providi ng important information sources to the public in connection with 
priority government services, including health, education, agriculture, 
employment, and similar subjects.  
 Supporting innovation and entrepreneurship in the domestic ICT sector, so as 
to enab le new start -up business ventures, particularly small enterprises, to 
capture a significant portion of national ICT service demand.  
 Expanding and preserving local historical and cultural heritage through 
digitization of traditional information sources and incentives for developing 
ongoing indigenous data collection and repositories.  
Project Options : 
Key options for projects to support development of ICT content and applications 
include:  
 Original and translated websites and other materials presented in local, 
indigenous languages, highlighting information of greatest interest to 
populations who speak these languages.  
 Information content made specifically for and by local community users, 
sharing local knowledge, history, and culture, as well as business and 
government information, ideally developed by local users themselves.   
ASEAN White Paper  
Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 34  Projects focused on graphic interface, audio -video, and other nonwritten 
content aimed at engaging and assisting nonliterate users , as well as  similar 
applications and content for dis abled or uneducated users.  
 Support for e ntrepreneurial ventures focusing on creating innovative 
applications for mobile and smart phones, tablets, and other new devices , 
including projects to help finance tech hubs and ICT incubators.  
 Digital finance and m obile money projects, in partnership with banks, to 
provide access to e -finance for unbanked citizens, and easy funds transfer 
and payment options.  
 Apps to assist citizens living in remote rural areas, in fields such as  farming, 
livestock, fisheries, and forestry.  
6.2 Digital Literacy  
Beyond the benefits of appealing ICT content, many new users in USO areas need 
support in understanding the value, use, and capabilities of these technologies , and 
then in being able to use those  capabilities to make better  use of ICTs  and 
broadband internet . This can especially be the case for marginalized groups and 
populations, who have been restricted from exposure and affordable access to ICTs. 
Recent efforts have begun to focus strong attention on these user needs, in the  form 
of digital literacy programs and related ICT capacity building initiatives  that aim to 
educate, inform, and equip all types of citizens and organizations to become 
effective users of ICTs.  
Digital literacy strategies are also coordinated with programs involving general 
education and training in technology, and the promotion of business development , 
entrepreneurship , and innovation  in this sector. These types of projects tend to go far 
beyond the traditional notions of universal service, but the y encompass the goals of 
fostering true universal adoption of the broadband ICT ecosystem.  While some 
ASEAN countries have introduced elements of such support programs, such as the 
Philippines Tech4Ed program, this is still a new field for the relatively n ew entrants, 
who would all benefit from developing forward -looking digital literacy strategies.   
Objectives : 
Digital literacy and ICT capacity building programs should be designed to meet the 
specific needs and opportunities of key user groups throughout society. This means 
that there will need to be multiple approaches and customized strategies, developed 
through research and consultation with target beneficiaries.  in general, the main 
objectives of all such programs can be summarized as follows:    
ASEAN White Paper  
Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 35  Raise public awareness of the role, functions, opportunities, and risks of ICTs, 
to help encourage beneficial use of the internet, smart phones, and other 
technologies, while also preparing users to recognize and avoid potential 
harmful uses.   
 Stimulate new and increased u se of ICTs, particularly where new services are 
introduced, and also among groups that may have been excluded from ICT 
access, such as women, the elderly, indigenous populations, and p eople  with 
disabilities.  
 Help d evelop ICT skills  among the ge neral public, and within target groups, to 
enhance the overall experience and benefits of ICT use and  increase job 
opportunities.  
 Support small and medium entrepreneurs  in adopt ing and deploy ing ICTs in 
their local businesses.  
 Improve overall communication  within target communities, among citizens, 
local government, businesses, and the broader national and global society.  
Project Options : 
Projects that seek to enhance digital literacy can focus on raising awareness and 
skills among the general ICT user popu lation or can focus on specific target groups 
or communities. In most cases, projects should be implemented through 
partnerships among  USFs, government and donor programs, and partner 
organizations, such as technical training schools, university programs, local 
community institutions, and other public agencies. Some of the main options that can 
be considered in various contexts include the following:  
 ICT public relations and awareness campaigns : Publicity, events, 
advertisements, contests, and other high-profile activities. Projects can be 
stand -alone or linked to the rollout  of new networks and services, to prepare 
new users to take best advantage of the arrival of broadband ICTs in their 
communities. Such programs can be developed separately from the 
infrastructure and service projects, or they can become a mandated feature of 
such projects, to be designed or subcontracted by operators.  
 General t raining classes and workshops : Projects can support a wide range of 
public training classes and workshops for beg inning ICT users or more 
experienced citizens who want to learn additional skills. These can be offered 
through CICs or in other public settings on a periodic or recurring basis.   
ASEAN White Paper  
Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 36  Specialized student educational curriculum : Customized classes and 
applicatio ns to teach targeted skills to students such as coding and 
typing /data entry, introducing technical familiarity in primary and secondary 
education.   
 Community -based technical support resources : Support for training and 
employment of designated local technical specialists within small and remote 
communities. These support personnel can be affiliated with CICs or other 
services, with responsibility to assist local residents with a variety of needs: 
device use and maintenance, repairs, service and equipm ent installation, 
applications, and general technical knowledge.  
 Entrepreneurial assistance : Focused assistance to aspiring ICT entrepreneurs 
on how to start and manage a tech or online business.  
 Public administration training :  Projects to teach staff of local government 
offices to use computer systems, databases, and other new technology 
platforms as they are introduced in local administrations.  
 Small businesses training : Projects to teach small business owners and 
employees  how to make use of the cloud -based software business solutions 
that are now specially made for small businesses and are easily available  and 
useable.  
6.3 ICT Affordability  
Even as ICT/telecommunications networks and infrastructure are expanding further 
into unserved areas, affordabilit y of services, especially advanced broadband 
access, remains a critical issue. In locations already covered by broadband services, 
large numbers of citizens in less developed societies do not subscribe to and use 
these services ; affordability is the primar y barrier. A majority of these unconnected 
persons worldwide are women.  
True universal service policies, therefore, must address the inequities between 
incomes and service and equipment prices that confront low -income citizens, in 
order to promote reasonably affordable options to allow  everyone to effectively use 
ICTs.  
Policy and regulatory reforms that increase competition and innovation are the best 
tools to unlock technological advances that continue to reduce the costs of ICT 
services , facilities, and devices, putting them within reach of increasing numbers of 
people. However, it is also recognized that some populations will remain beyond the 
reach of the market, and so there must also be public access initiatives and 
subsidies  to brin g these groups into the ICT world.    
ASEAN White Paper  
Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 37 Objectives : 
ICT affordability programs aim to reduce costs and prices for broadband ICTs, 
specifically for targeted low -income and underprivileged user groups. The Alliance 
for Affordable internet (A4AI) has proposed a “ 1 for 2” target for affordable internet 
access. This goal indicates that 1  gigabyte of mobile broadband data service per 
month should be available at a price equal to 2  percent  or less of average  monthly  
incomes, as measured by gross national income  per ca pita. This standard has 
recently been adopted as the new affordability target by the United Nations’ 
Broadband Commission.10 
Other objectives of affordability programs can target not only broadband connectivity 
and internet/data use, but also the cost of de vices such as smart phones, tablets, 
and computers, to bring ownership of these  devices  within the reach of individuals 
and households.  
Project Options : 
Several approaches to improving affordability have been introduced in various 
countries, and more are u nder consideration. Some key options include:  
 Free/affordable internet access centers : CICs and similar facilities that create 
awareness and train users to connect to the internet . These access centers 
should offer the user various other facilities  such as  printing.  
 Free Wi-Fi hotspots : After new users have learned  the necessary skills  at 
internet access centers, many will want  use the internet o n their smartphones. 
Public Wi-Fi signals that permit some limited degree of free data usage, 
whether via smart p hones or laptops /tablets , etc.  are therefore very useful.  
 Subsidi zed smart phones : Smartphones are the most often used devices for 
internet access. Low price ( not free) smartphone purchase options linked to 
mobile operator subscriptions , bundled with free monthly data packages  up to 
a limited extent , help a lot . 
 Computer ownership subsidies : This includes l ow-priced purchase programs 
for personal computers and laptop s purchase for eligible low -income 
households or students, subsidized by government funds.

 38 7.0 ASEAN USO Case Examples  
The Workshop to Support the Formulation of Next Generation Universal Service 
toward Ubiquitous Broadband Ecosystems (USO 2.0) , held in Nay Pyi Taw in March 
2018  included  presentations from six countries : Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the 
Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. 
All of the ASEAN Member States that have been following USF strategies for some 
time (Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and to some extent Viet  Nam) are already 
actively involved in next -generation USF activities described in the previous sections. 
In fact, even the Philippines,  which is not  a USO -country, is also pursuing activities 
that could be labelled as USO 2.0.  
ASEAN Member  State s can be grouped into three categories  with respect to 
universal service funds:   
 Economically well -off countries that do not need a USF (Brunei Darussalam 
and Singapore);  
 Countries with universal access/service funds (Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, 
and Viet Nam); and  
 Countries in the process o f creating universal access/service funds 
(Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and the Philippines).  
The country cases  are summarized below . 
7.1 Indonesia  
The Indonesia n USF is run by a public service agency  commonly referred to as  
BP3TI . Formed by the government in 2005 , BP3TI gets its funding from the 
contributions of telecom operators  which make contributions at  the rate of 1.25  
percent  of their annual gross revenu es. 
The Indonesian USF was recently redesigned in line with the demands of next 
generation USFs. T he redesigned USF is now more focuse d on the needs of the 
local communities , using a  bottom -up approach. I ts projects are  tailored to the 
conditions and readine ss of each  region  and were developed with the participation of  
stakeholders right from the plan ning stage.  As a result, the redesigned fund now 
addressed  not only the infrastructure  of ICT , but also elements of the ICT ecosystem  
of ICT  such as content, apps, and even community empowerment (see figure 
below). This approach helps ensure that the infras tructure can be  optimally utilized  
by a wide range of stakeholders .

Myanmar, on 6 March 2018 . 
Although the Indonesian USF is currently struggling with tough challenges  (including 
government investigation s), its revised operational plan  shows that it is in line with 
the concept of next generation USOs .  
The Indonesian presentation at the  workshop focused on its  achievements and the 3 
priority projects  of BP3TI : 
 Palapa Ring Project : This project  is the largest of the priority projects and is a 
true PPP. It has  entailed extensive infrastructure investment including l aying 
13,000 k ilometers of submarine optic fiber cables, connecting 57  districts 
(including 28 cities) in remote islands . 
 Internet access : Connecting 5,000 locations in remote islands (2,664 live now)  
 The BTS Project : At the time of the workshop it was projected that by the end 
of 2017, new BTSs at 504 remote locations would have been  commissioned.  
7.2 Malaysia  
The Malaysian  Universal Service Provision  Fund  (USPF)  is operated  by Malaysian 
Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) under the  universal service 
provision (USP)  regulations promulgated  in 2001. Provid ing broadband internet 
(rather than just voice) to unserved and under -served individuals and communities 
became an obligation after an August 2008 amendment to the USP regulations.  
 
ASEAN White Paper  
Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 40 The USPF  gets its funding from the teleco m operators, which make contributions at 
the rate of 6  percent  of their annual weighted revenue  (minimum revenue threshold 
being  RM 2 million ).  
The USPF’s 1Malaysia Internet Centre (PI1M) is a prime example of USO 2 .0. It is 
the result of an evolving  effort that began with the USP Communication Centers 
established in 2007. Reflecting the changing needs of individuals and the 
community, the PIIM  not only provides connectivity to bridge the digital divide, it also 
helps the ICT ecosystem of ICTs by developing human capital and promoting use of 
ICT to build a knowledgeable society.

Myanmar, on 6 March 2018.  
The well-equipped Digital Service Centers (DSC s), as shown above, are being set 
up under the PI1M  and 841 have been opened so far. They  provide  various demand 
side services like e -payment, e -governance, and e -learning. These center s also offer 
training in ICT entrepreneurship, digital economy , and content creation. In addition,  
DSCs offer  services lik e online e xams  and e-health , and act as e-health center s—all 
in line with the demands of next generation USO . 
Other Malaysian USPF initiatives to respond to  demand side  needs  include 
subsidies provided for personal computer s and smartphones.  
 
ASEAN White Paper  
Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 41 7.3 Thailand  
The Thailand Broadcasting and Telecommunications Research and Development 
Fund for the Public Interest  (BTRDF) was created in 2001 , under National Broadcast 
and Telecommunication Commission (NBTC)  and serves as the Thai USF . It gets its 
funding from contri butions of telecom operators, who contribute 2.5 percent  of their 
annual revenues.  
Universal service to support building of the nation’s  digital foundation  became  the 
goal of USO  efforts in Thailand  with the commencement of USO Master Plan (2017 –
2021).  This brought the Thai USF in to the USO 2.0 movement . 
Various layers of the 2017 –2020  Master Plan address  the elements of USO 2.0 , 
including  availability, affordability , and accessibility.  
Figure 10. Thailand USO Master Plan 2017 –2020 
  
Source: Presentation provided by the delegate from Thailand at the Workshop on USO 2.0 in Nay Pyi Taw, 
Myanmar, on 6 March 2018 . 
As can be seen in the figure  above , efforts to improve the  availability of broadband 
services not only target remote villages but also cater to serving broadba nd to rural 
schools. 3,920 villages have been  covered in 2017 –18. 
The 2017 –2020 Master Plan  also calls for the creation  special telecenters for 
schools , under the  School Net  program . To date, using USF funding, 763  school 
 
ASEAN White Paper  
Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 42 telecenters have been built and  equipped with all the necessary devices and 
software.  
To provide affordable broadband to under -served sectors of the public, the BTRDF  
sets up  telecenters and free Wi-Fi hotspots in remote villages (5,229 Wi-Fi hotspots 
set up so far).  It also includes  an emphasis on affordable, scalable technologies, 
such as rural femtocell sites to bring mobile signals to unserved areas.  
Finally , in order to make broadband easily usable —particularly for the disabled, the 
rural teac hers and student s—the B TRDF funds  ICT training.  
7.4 Viet Nam  
The Vietnam Public -Utility Telecommunication Service Fund (VTF)  under the 
Ministry of Information and Communications,  was established in 2005 . It gets its 
funding from contributions of telecom operators, which contribute at rate s that vary 
from 1  percent  to 3 percent  of their annual revenues.  
Figure 11. Viet Nam Universal Service Plan  
  
Source: Presentation provided by the delegate from Viet Nam at the Workshop on USO 2.0 in Nay Pyi Taw, 
Myanmar, on 6 March 2018.  
VTF is also moving closer to becoming a next generation USO (USO 2.0). Its current 
universal services program, which will run up to 2020, has projects for both the 
 
ASEAN White Paper  
Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 43 supply and demand sides of broadband connectiv ity. It funds up to 70 percent of 
CapEx for projects related to overall broadband connectivity through the rollout of 
fixed and mobile broadband, including optic fibers. VTF also provides funds for 
demand side programs. Th e figure  on the previous page  lays out the operational 
plan.  
Primary activities include the following:  
 Connectivity for emergencies , include funding for the Marine Search and 
Rescue Services, and communications for disaster prevention and recovery ;  
 Connectivity for communities includ ing setting up new i nternet telecenters,  as 
well as  maintaining existing internet community centers , directory services , 
and maritime lines for fishermen ; 
 Connectivity for sc hools, hospitals , and communes,  including developing web 
portal s; and  
 Digital broadcasting : funding digital broadcast transmitters (including satellite  
broadcasting ) as well as set -top boxes on the customer side.  
7.5 The Philippines  
Althoug h the Philippines  has not yet established a USF , the indications are that the 
country is movin g in that direction . The n ecessary policy and regulatory reforms are 
being undertaken in the form of amendments and revisions to existing  ICT policies, 
laws, and regulations . The Philippines’ National Broadband Plan already caters for 
elements on the supply as well as the demand  sides of broadband internet access  
see the figure on the following page ).  
On the supply side, the government is on its way to setting up an operating network 
to establish connectivity in the countryside. On the demand side, th e government 
intends to take the necessary steps to stimulate demand and increase broadband 
uptake, by providing “open, pervasive, inclusive, affordable and trusted broadband 
internet access.”  
A law for “Free Internet Access Program in Public Places” was s igned in August 
2017, albeit without addressing the need for a separate USO -like organization to 
implement the law. The stated target of the 2017 law is to provide free internet at 
over 13,000 locations; 912 sites had been connected as of December 2017.  
Technology Empowerment for E ducation Employment, Entrepreneurs, and 
Economic Development (Tech4Ed) is another ‘USO2.0 -like’ initiative. It provides 
shared access facility to ICT -enabled services and relevant content relating to eAgri 
and eHealth. Every cente r has a store to help the center sustain itself.   
ASEAN White Paper  
Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 44 So far over 2,000 Tech4Ed centers have been established. Nearly 100,000 
individuals have registered at these centers, and 58 percent of the registrants are 
women.

7.6 Cambodia  
The s tart of the USOF in Cambodia was triggered by a royal decree promulgated in 
December 2015, followed by a sub -decree of July 2017 in which the mechanism for 
implementation of USO F Program was determined. The USOF  falls under  Ministry of 
Post Telecom and Communications  and is governed by  a board of directors . Its 
funding comes from  telecom operators, which contribute at a rate of 2  percent  of 
their gross annual revenues.  
Presently, US OF Cambodia is going through a formative  period, in which it is 
building the institution and its capacity , collecting the necessary data , and preparing 
pilot projects.  
 
ASEAN White Paper  
Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 45 Next steps  would include  drafting of a national USO law for 2019 –2023, as well as  
building human resource c apacit ies, specifically in tw o domains : use of the f und, and 
the review, monitoring and  evaluation of projects.  
Because USOF Cambodia is still in the early stages of its development, it is too early 
for it to be addressing  USO 2.0  issues .

 46 8.0 Scenarios for Adapting Future 
USO Policies to Technological 
Change  
This section  provide s a brief overview of issues and ideas relating to the evolution of 
future USO policies in the context of continuing changes in the ICT technology and 
market landscape.   
The global ICT industry has advanced so rapidly, with such revolutionary chan ges in 
a short time, that it is very difficult for anyone, from engineers to policymakers (let 
alone  consumers ) to keep up with the shifting landscape.  For policy planning 
purposes, however, especially universal service policies, it is critical to take into 
account these ongoing changes.  The discussion that follows offers some guidelines 
for consideration and further discussion . 
8.1 Trends in Technology Evolution  
Predicting future technology evolution, especially in a fast -changing, dynamic 
industry such as ICT, is at best a speculative exercise. The visions of technology 
futurists in the past have been wrong at least as often as they have been right.   
Nevertheless, there are well established theories and methods for anticipating the 
general trends of tech nology evolution, which can help create a foundation for 
projecting the next generations and directions of ICTs.  
Figure 13. Trends in Engineering System Evolution
  
Source: Hoon, Douglas “Trends of Engineering System Evolution ” 
 
ASEAN White Paper  
Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 47 For example, the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving  has been developed and 
adapted over many decades to account for common trends in innovation across 
industries and technologies. This has produced a widely recognized hierarchy of 
Trends in Engineering Sy stem Evolution (TESE), which technicians and business 
planners use to  forecast future changes in technology  (see figure above ).  
Each of these trends can be identified and examined at a given stage of technology 
evolution, to anticipate the likely directio ns of future changes in a system or platform. 
The trends are not necessarily sequential or mutually dependent . Rather, they tend 
to occur in parallel  and to varying degrees, depending on the nature of the system 
and its stage of development.  In the case o f ICT, the following  general trends have 
been prominent throughout the technology revolutions of the recent past : 
 S-curve evolution and increasing value: These are basic principles of most 
technology development. Innovation tends to occur along an s-curve function, 
featuring three or four  stages: slow initial experimentation, then rapid 
acceleration as the best new ideas are widely disseminated, followed by a 
slowdown , and sometimes reversal as the wave of changes reaches its limits. 
Each stage is driv en by the motivation to increase value in the system. With 
ICTs, these trends have been dramatic across multiple generations of 
transmission, computing, smartphone, and other technologies, which have 
seen order -of-magnitude improvements in performance acco mpanied by 
persistent cost declines for more than two decades.  
 Increasing dynamism, controllability,  and coordination : These trends reflect 
the tendency of technology innovators to move in the direction of greater 
usefulness, flexibility, and functionality  for any system. With ICTs, each new 
service, device, and quality enhancement has produced a broader range of 
choice and control for end users, while also further integrating and 
coordinating the role of these technologies in all aspects of social, 
commerc ial, and public life.  
 Decreasing human involvement and transition to a supersystem : These are 
somewhat higher -level macro trends as technical systems evolve deeper into 
their life cycle. They tend to become so integrated into societal and industrial 
functions that there is less need for humans to operate them. In the same 
manner, well -established systems that have been improved to n ear the peak 
of their potential tend to be incorporated as components of broader 
supersystems, along with other components, which themselves then continue 
to evolve. The latest trends in ICTs have been following these patterns. Such 
developments as t he Int ernet of Things (IoT) , machine  learning, artificial 
intelligence,  cloud computing, big data analytics, and blockchain cybersecurity 
all represent increasingly sophisticated systems that are based on automated

 48 interactions among high -level programs with minimal direct human 
involvement.  
Trends in consumer and market behavior are also important to the evolution and 
adoption of technology by a society. The Theory of Diffusion  of Innovation s 
addresses the patterns of market response to technological change . It identifi es 
different stages and categories of consumers, such as innovators, early adopters, 
and early and late majorities, which tend to follow a bell curve sequence for adoption 
as a market grows.  With ICTs, these patterns have played out both within national 
markets and across the globe , as new technologies and services have been 
introduced (fixed line, mobile, Internet, broadband, smart phones, etc.).  In 
developing economies, the pace of ICT diffusion has been constrained by cost, as 
many citizens h ave not had access to, or cannot afford, the latest innovations. USO 
policies have been largely designed to help remove these constraints , and allow the 
society -wide trend of diffusion to expand more rapidly and equitably.  
At a more macro level, t he inters ection s of these technical and market trends have  
demonstrated a tendency , over time,  to stimulate fundamental socioeconomic 
transformation . In the case of communications related technologies , there  has been 
a recurring pattern of such society -wide impacts for more than a century. Going back 
to the invention of the telegraph and the telephone, and passing through the 
introduction of film, radio, television, first generation computers, and many other 
innovations , these technologies have c onsistently followed four stages of macro 
impacts , which have been repeated throughout the most recent Information Age  
developments:  
1.  Innovation : The initial discovery, invention,  and introduction of a substantial 
new method or system, enabling fundamen tally different and enhanced 
means of communication.  
2.  Adoption : Consumer purchase and use of the product or service, typically 
exhibiting a rapid growth phase after initial uptake, leading to near -term mass 
adoption as a “must -have” new commodity.  
3.  Integration : This occurs when an  innovation becomes so widely adopted 
and utilized that it is integrated with many basic functions and activities of 
daily life. Other products and services and business models are adapted to 
incorporate or exploit the new te chnology . There is a marked dividing line 
between the era “before” and “after” the innovation was introduced.  
4.  Transformation : The adoption and integration of the technology ultimately 
leads to a more complete transformation of both social and economic activity 
across society. It becomes a primary driver of investment, business, social

 49 interaction, and government affairs. Citizens and communities that have not 
adapted  well to the new system are effectively left behind in the modern age.  
These persistent trends suggest that, when sufficiently attractive and innovative new 
technologies are established, it is all but inevitable that they will follow similar paths 
to those that came before. This does  not mean that every new development will 
transform society . The challenge  for science and business  is to invent truly effective, 
useful, valuable devices and systems that can radically upgrade and replace the 
previous generation of technology.  In this regard, there have been more missteps 
than success stories.  But when new potentially transformative  technol ogies do 
emerge, as evidenced by early adoption, impacts on cost and convenience, 
integration with other technical and socio economic trends, and so forth, it is 
important to acknowledge and anticipate the direction s they are likely to follow.  
The implicat ions of these concepts for universal service are discussed in the 
following sections.   
8.2 Scenarios for Future ICT USO  Policies  
The discussion  above  about  technology and market trends and forward -looking 
policy principles can be applied as a baseline fram ework for considering changes to 
USO policies in light of ongoing technological evolution. The following scenarios 
highlight some of the most prominent current trends in the ICT ecosystem, and how 
they might be addressed in future USO programs. While each new development 
should be studied in -depth in the context of current conditions, the discussion below 
offers a starting point for analysis and debate :  
 High-speed mobile broadband networks (4G/5G) : As wireless technology 
continues to improve, services and applications will migrate to the highest 
quality networks. Individuals, organizations, businesses, and public  sector 
actors  will need access to these platforms to be able to share in the 
expanding benefits of next -generation ICT, and USO policies will have to keep 
pace. The eventual goal for all societies should be ubiquitous coverage of all 
populations with the most advanced and useful networks available.  
 Smart devices : Consumers can only u se advanced ICT networks, services, 
and applications if they have access to appropriate devices. These include 
smart phones, tablets, digital assistants, and a growing array of specialized 
equipment for personal and business use. The more key functions that require 
such devices are integrated into daily life, the more important it becomes for 
USO initiatives to help ensure that all citizens can obtain both service 
coverage and affordable smart  devices.   
ASEAN White Paper  
Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 50  Internet of Things : Beyond personal smart devices, the Internet of Things is 
bringing connectivity to a growing range of appliances, business equipment, 
and other items. It is unclear which, if any, of these emerging smart machines 
might eventual ly become “essential” enough to qualify for universal service 
support . But it is possible to envision social transformations that could render 
certain IOT capabilities as indispensable to many households or small 
businesses as mobile phones have already be come.  
 Digital finance : In many developing countries, mobile money and other forms 
of digital financial applications have already emerged as the primary source of 
banking, payments, and transfers for large segments of the population. Such 
applications are l ikely to continue to expand, as traditional banks and even 
physical currency decline.  As digital finance becomes essential to more forms 
of commerce —including e -commerce —it may be necessary to recognize 
access to such functions as a priority USO objective . 
 Over -the-top (OTT) applications : The scope and use of OTT apps has been 
expanding rapidly, including voice, messaging, video, social media, and a 
variety of other services that can be accessed only via advanced digital 
networks and devices. The impact on  telecom operators is to reduce usage 
revenues from similar services, while increasing demand for data 
connections. Some have advocated for OTT providers to be required to 
contribute to US Fs, although this may be difficult to implement in practice. 
USO pol icymakers  might, however, negotiate with some OTT services to 
support priority access in exchange for contributions, for example.  
 ICT education and digital literacy :  As ICTs become increasingly advanced 
and integrated into society, the importance of train ing all citizens in their use 
and value also increases. School curricula and public digital literacy programs 
are b ecoming a vital gateway to effective participation in the ICT -enabled 
world. These may soon be among the highest priorities for USO policies and 
related ICT development agendas.  
 Digital security : As advanced ICTs become more ubiquitous, so do the risks 
associated with personal and business data security. For universal adoption 
and integration of these technologies to be safe, effective, and val uable, users 
must be protected from the worst forms of cybercrime  and exploitation. It will 
be important, therefore, for universal service polic ymakers  to coordinate to 
make sure these policies align with and support digital security laws, 
monitoring, and enforcement, especially on behalf of the most vulnerable and 
inexperienced new users.

Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 51  Artificial intelligence, virtual/ augmented reality : These types of technologies, 
once the realm of science fiction, are becoming more “real” all the time, with 
nearly limitless potential applications in the not -too-distant future. While there 
are already extensive deployments of each in existing products and serv ices, 
it is likely that the underlying architectures and programs will be continuously 
enhanced over time  and will ultimately be incorporated in a wide range of new 
devices and applications . Such developments are far beyond the scope of 
current USO policie s and objectives, but it is certainly possible to imagine a 
next generation of technologies that will become so useful, important, and 
popular as to demand universal adoption.

 52 9.0 Implications for USO 
Objectives and Principles  
9.1 General Principles  
Universal service obligation policies for ICT have two major rationales:  
 To promote more equitable access to technologies and services for those 
citizens and regions that the market has overlooked; and  
 To accelerate the spread of socioeconomic benefits of ICTs throughout 
society, by reinforcing network externalities and public goods that these 
technologies enable.  
As ICTs continue to evolve and transform societies, USO policies must adapt to the 
changes, while maintaining focus on these primary objectives. This suggests certain 
key principles that USO policymakers should take into account when reviewing, 
developing, and revising such policies in anticipation of future technology and market 
changes. These include the following:  
 Avoid distorting th e market : USO policies should encourage and complement 
private, competitive investment, and should not subsidize or distort 
commercially viable markets. In general, this suggests that new technologies 
should be given a chance to succeed or fail initially, without USO or other 
officials picking winners.  
 Support and encourage market -based diffusion : USO support should align 
with the emerging trends of service adoption observed in more established 
markets, to permit more rapid diffusion of technology throughou t the 
population.  
 Do not subsidize outdated technologies : Although older generations of 
technology might be less costly, allocating USO resources to fund obsolete 
services will only slow the transition to emerging standards, and leave 
underserved populatio ns still further behind.  
 Support adoption as well as access : Building infrastructure and making 
services and signals available will not be effective unless citizens are able to 
adopt and use the latest technologies. USO policies need to ensure that their 
end result is widespread adoption of advanced ICTs.   
ASEAN White Paper  
Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 53  Facilitate use and integration : Beyond adoption, USO policies should also 
promote effective use of ICTs and their integration into citizens’ and 
communities’ social and economic activities.  
 Seek to reinfor ce socioeconomic benefits : Where it is clear that technology 
trends yield public benefits on a wide scale, USO policies should support and 
encourage these trends as part of their mandate.  
 Emphasize social equity : Priority should be given to social equity g oals, 
bringing in those without access to technology or services, but not by 
imposing older or minimal quality services which simply leave these groups 
further behind. USO objectives should be to ensure that the underserved 
populations have the full opport unity to participate in social transformation 
arising from ICTs.  
 Anticipate change : To the extent possible, USO policies should anticipate 
changing technologies, market and social behavior, and should be as flexible 
and adaptive as possible, helping to sti mulate innovation, adoption, 
integration, and transformation.  
 Coordinate with other policies, stakeholders : USO policies should be closely 
coordinated with other ICT policies, with industry and academia, and other 
stakeholders. The focus of such coordinati on should be to agree on areas 
where market stimulus and public service and institutional programs will both 
promote socioeconomic benefits and accelerate societal transformation 
trends.  
9.2 Priorities for ASEAN  USO Policies  
The objectives and priorities o f ASEAN member states with respect to universal ICT 
access and service will continue to vary by country, depending on socioeconomic 
conditions, the level of market development, and policy and regulatory status. For 
most countries in the region, the key goa ls will remain to promote access to 
infrastructure and services, and the ongoing integration of advanced ICTs into 
citizens’ lives and economic activity. The above principles highlight the main 
considerations that policymakers should take into account in p ursuing these 
objectives.  
The examples and findings of this report suggest that there are a variety of options 
and mechanisms that ASEAN governments can employ, in terms of policies, 
programs, projects, and other initiatives. These include the following:  
 Build -out of broadband infrastructure to reach unserved areas : Although the 
market may continue to expand on its own, it remains a top priority for  
ASEAN White Paper  
Next Generation Universal Service 2018  
 
 
 
 
 54 universal service policies to ensure that necessary infrastructure, including 
backbone networks and fixed an d mobile broadband access, be established 
throughout all territories to the greatest extent possible . 
 Public and institutional connectivity : Universal service programs should be 
designed to prioritize public broadband connectivity, to bring access to the 
most people in the most important locations. Th is include s community access 
centers and similar initiatives such as public Wi-Fi, as well as connections for 
schools, universities, health clinics, and government offices.  
 Demand support and stimulation: As co nnectivity expands, policies must 
increasingly focus on ensuring that citizens can take advantage of advanced 
ICTs in their daily lives. Programs should promote digital literacy, relevant 
applications and content, and affordability of both services and dev ices, with a 
particular focus on groups that have been left behind by the digital revolution.
