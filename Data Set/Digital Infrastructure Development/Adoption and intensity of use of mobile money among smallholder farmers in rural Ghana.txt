Abstract
The impact of mobile money services in sub-Saharan Africa have been largely recognised. However, empirical
studies are principally lacking on the factors influencing the decision to own a mobile phone (first hurdle),
register with mobile money (second hurdle) and the intensity of use of mobile money services (third hurdle).
This study examined the determinants of the mobile phone ownership, drivers of registration (participation) of
mobile money services, and the intensity of use of mobile money services in rural Ghana by employing the triple
hurdle approach. The first and second hurdle were analysed using the logit model while quasi-poisson regres-
sion was used to analyse the third hurdle. The analysis from the cross-sectional data showed that the decision
to own a mobile phone was driven by household size, marital status, the farm size, access to electricity, income
status and the type of occupation engaged, whereas the decision to register with mobile money was influenced
by the age, educational status, marital status, household size, farm size and the type of occupation engaged in by
the household head. The intensity of usage of mob ile money services was influenced by the age of the
household head, higher educational level, marital status of the household head, household and farm size as
well as the distance of the household heads from the mobile money agent which directly influences the intensity
of use of mobile money services by household heads. The study recommends that strategies that promote
access to electricity and occupation in the formal sector or both farming and trading in the rural communities
should be promoted. Furthermore, policy attention should focus on location, farmers and farm characteristics.

Introduction
Estimates shows that approximately 90 per cent of the
people domiciled in developing countries do not have
access to financial services (Hinson, 2010). On the con-
trary, statistics from the Global System Mobile Associ-
ation (GSMA) shows that as of 2014, approximately
90%of all telephone lines in Africa were mobile lines,
which makes the Africa continent the fastest-growing
region in terms of mobile phone penetration (GSMA,2018). Empirically, Munyegera and Matsumoto (2014)
suggested that the relative concentration of financial
institutions, especially, commercial banks in urban

centres with limited rural penetration in Sub-Saharan
Africa, have made the mobile money business a thriving
one. Mobile phones are, therefore, significant prospects
for financial inclusion for the unbanked in developing
countries and the mobile money platform helps
empower the poor by smoothing consumption whilst
protecting them from numerous vulnerabilities (World
Bank, 2012). Referring to Sub-Saharan Africa, the
GSMA (2017) indicated that as at December, 2016, “the
mobile money industry processed more than 22 billion
dollars in transactions and its total revenue for the top
providers surpassed 1 billion dollars and there were 277
million registered accounts more than the total number
of bank accounts in the region”.
It has been argued that in Ghana, a well-
functioning payment system is imperative for ensur-
ing the stability, safety, and the soundness of the
Ghanaian financial system (Bank of Ghana, 2017).
Amidst the instability facing the formal banking
sector in Ghana, the Bank of Ghana (BoG), to achieve
financial inclusion, granted all telecommunications
companies license to operate mobile financial ser-
vices. Since the issuing of the mobile money license,
available evidence suggests that between 2010 and
2017, telecommunication companies such as Voda-
fone and MTN Ghana have established more than one
hundred thousand (100,000) mobile money merchant
points to support the mobile money services (Bank of
Ghana, 2016). It is, therefore, not very surprising that
mobile money is seen as an important channel through
which most unbanked individuals in Ghana are
included in the formal banking systems. Unreservedly,
mobile money is progressively becoming the most
important means of payment for the underserved and
the unbanked in Ghana. According to the Bank of
Ghana (2017), the increasing usage of mobile money
in Ghana partially accounts for the high level of mobile
phones penetration in rural areas. Furthermore, empiri-
cal estimation shows that over 80 %of the rural adult
Ghanaian population do not own a bank account with
any financial institutions (PricewaterhouseCoopers,
2011), but own a mobile money account.
Despite the ostensible ease and convenience that
mobile money presents, it can be seen that there is a
gap between the ownership of mobile phone, adoption
or registration of mobile money and the intensity of use
of mobile money services in Ghana (Bank of Ghana,
2016). The GSMA (2015) estimates for Ghana show
that between 2007 and 2012, only a few thousand
mobile money accounts were opened, and millions of
potential customers remained beyond the reach ofmobile financial providers. The important factors
affecting the adoption of mobile money are safety
issues such as risk tolerance, account misuse, compat-
ibility, relative advantage, complexity, or simplicity of
the impact of adoption (Akomea-Frimpong, Andoh,
Akomea-Frimpong, & Dwomoh-Okudzeto, 2019; Gil-
man & Joyce, 2012). The analysis of the current litera-
ture on the adoption and intensity of use of mobile
money as a financial instrument by the poor, reveals
that limited works have been conducted in the Sub-
Saharan African context. Consequently, this calls for
the need to understand the nature of the adoption of
mobile money services and the intensity of use of
mobile money services by the rural populations. Myr-
iads of studies conducted on the adoption of mobile
money services (Wyche & Steinfield, 2016; Munyegera
&M a t s u m o t o ,2 0 1 6 ;N a r t e h ,M a h m o u d ,&A m o h ,
2017), have not focussed on the intensity of use of
mobile money (MoMo) in sub-Saharan Africa (Islam,
Muzi, & Meza, 2018), or Ghana in particular. Yet both
adoption and intensity of use of mobile money can take
place if individuals either own a personal phone or have
access to a mobile phone. In this study, we aim at
answering the question: What factors influence the
adoption and intensity of use of mobile money among
the rural smallholder farm households in Ghana? From
the research question, three specific objectives are
addressed in this paper. These specific objectives are:
/C15To determine the factors affecting ownership of
mobile phone among the rural households in
Ghana.
/C15To examine the drivers of registration (partici-
pation) of mobile money services among rural
households in Ghana.
/C15To assess the determinants of the intensity of
use of mobile money services in rural Ghana.
The findings of this study will redound to the ben-
efit of society considering that it expounds the factors
that determine the adoption and intensity of use of
mobile money in Ghana. In addition, this study will
help telecommunication c ompanies recognise the
socio-economic barriers to the unbanked population’s
acceptance and intensity of use of mobile money ser-
vices so that they can formulate strategies to address
these obstacles. This would increase the use of the
electronic money mobile payment system and bridge
the divide between the rich and the poor, the rural and
urban population and strengthen the socioeconomic
and developmental agenda for growth. To achieve2 Information Development XX(X)these objectives, the triple hurdle approach, made up
of the logistics and quasi-poisson regression, were
utilised in this paper. The logistic regression analysis
was conducted to determine the factors affecting own-
ership of mobile phone among the rural smallholder
farm households in Ghana and to examine the drivers
of participation in the usage of mobile money services
among these rural households. The study focuses on
household heads who have or own personal mobile
phones and not whether an individual within the
household owns a mobile phone. The quasi-poisson
regression was applied to assess the determinants of
the intensity of use of mobile money in rural Ghana.
Literature review
Mobile money ownership, adoption, and financial
inclusion
As observed by Jonathan and Camilo (2008), the
mobile phone revolution has not only resulted in
increasing communication among individuals but has
increases the basic financial services to rural poor
households. Medhi and Ratan (2009) opined that the
total number of people with bank accounts is less than
the total number of mobile phone users across the
world. Johnson (2016) reported that of the total sam-
ple of 337 farm household in Kenya, only 28 %
reported that they have never used the mobile money
service but for those who have ever used money
mobile lower cost, instantaneous nature, convenience,
fee payment on withdrawal and extensive agent net-
work were the main reasons for the usage of mobile
money transfer services. Pope et al. (2011), observed
that migration of the rural poor in developing coun-
tries to urban areas is associated with increasing adop-
tion and intensity of mobile money. This is because as
the individual earns livelihood, they send money back
to their families on regular basis. Since money trans-
fer services are usually very dificult and expensive,
mobile money becomes th e cheaper medium for
transferring money. At the household level, the utili-
sation of mobile money has been identified to reduce
travel costs (Aker, Boumnijel, McClelland, & Tier-
ney, 2011); helped households smooth unexpected
income shocks by raising household welfare (Jack
& Suri, 2014); and to raise security (Wright, et al.,
2014). In addition, the risi ng level of remittances,
improve women’s economic empowerment and
improve financial inclusion is largely associated with
the increasing level of mobile money (Munyegera &
Matsumoto, 2016; Batista & Vicente, 2013).Abor et al. (2018) used the multipurpose nature of
mobile telephony to examine its welfare implications
employing a large sample of households in Ghana.
Employing the seemingly unrelated probit and instru-
mental variable procedure to test for two related
issues: first, whether m obile telephony promotes
pro-poor development by helping households to efi-
ciently allocate consumption and navigate out of pov-
erty, and secondly whether access to a broad array of
financial services enhances the capacity of house-
holds to live worthwhile lives, Abor et al. (2018)
found that mobile penetration and financial inclusion
significantly reduce the probability of a household
becoming poor and increase per capita household
consumption of food and non-food items. Further-
more, the authors show that the welfare benefits of
mobile telephony and financial inclusion are not more
pronounced in female-headed households.
Okello Candiya Bongomin et al. (2018) tested the
moderating effect of social networks in the relationship
between mobile money usage and financial inclusion
in rural Uganda. Okello Candiya Bongomin et al.
(2018) found a significant and positive moderating
effect of social networks in the relationship between
mobile money usage and financial inclusion in rural
Uganda. Furthermore, they reported that mobile money
usage and social networks have direct and significant
effects on financial inclusion in rural Uganda. The
findings further show the existence of social networks
of strong and weak ties among mobile money users
promote financial inclusion in rural Uganda.
Baber (2019) employed data from the World Bank
and Global Islamic Finance Report to compare the
performance of countries following the Islamic and
conventional finance system in terms of financial
inclusion and FinTech. Selecting ten countries from
both financial systems based on the presence of Isla-
mic finance and conventional finance, Baber (2019)
analyzed the data from the year 2011 to 2017. Baber
(2019) found that Islamic finance countries are more
inclusive in terms of financial inclusion and women
are financially more empowered as compared to their
counterparts, whereas count ries with conventional
finance have a higher number of FinTech users.
Intensity of mobile money usage and financial inclusion
The World Bank (2014) suggests that the high rate of
mobile phones network penetration and adoption,
lack of affordable alternatives, and lower service fees
relative to conventional bank account fees haveAsravor et al: Adoption and intensity of use of mobile money among smallholder farmers in rural Ghana 3resulted in the increased intensity of mobile money
usage in rural poor communities. The Mobile Money
Global Event (2015) study in Kenya showed that the
utilisation of mobile money as a tool for financial
inclusion increased the intensity of the use of mobile
money. The Mobile Money Global Event (2015)
study revealed that 90 million mobile money transac-
tions valued at about $2.16 billion (KSh227.9 billion)
were conducted in the year 2015 with more than
129,357 registered mobile money agents.
Higgins et al. (2012) argued that in Kenya 80 %of
business entities that use mobile money report using
the service once per week or more, in contrast to the
overall average usage of twice per month. Bangens
and Soderberg (2011) also found a similar average for
SMEs operating in Tanzania.
Research Framework: Triple Hurdle
Studies abound that have used double hurdle or two-
step models to examine the adoption and acceptance
of technology adoption among farm households
(Asravor, 2020; Danso-Abbeam, Dagunga, & Ehiak-
por, 2019). The double hurdle model is deficient in its
operationalisation as it focuses on the decision to reg-
ister for mobile money and the intensity to use but
does not incorporate the decision to own a mobile
phone in the modelling process. Thus, employing the
double hurdle approach will lead to biased and incon-
sistent estimates. The conceptualisation of the triple
hurdle approach first begins with the rural household
head deciding to either own or not to own a mobile
phone. The ownership decision is influenced by both
socio-economic (age, gender, marital status, etc.) and
non-socio-economic (income, access to mobile
money agent, etc) variables. Conditioned on the own-
ership decision, household heads then determine
whether to register or not to register for mobile money
(second stage). The decision to register for mobile
money is also influenced by the socio-economic as
well as non-socioeconomic factors. Based on the deci-
sion to register for mobile money services, the finan-
cial decision the head makes is on the intensity of use
of mobile money which is also affected by socio-
economic and non-socio-economic variables.
Materials and Methods
Sampling techniques
The study was conducted in three (3) regions of
Ghana, that is the Central region, Ashanti region andthe Northern region of Ghana. Thus, the study cov-
ered the savannah region (Northern region), forest
region (Ashanti region) and the Coastal region (Cen-
tral region). The multistage sampling technique was
employed to sample responding smallholder farmers
in this study (Murendo, Wollni, De Brauw, &
Mugabi, 2018) .The first stage involved the use of
purposive sampling technique to select the three
regions of Ghana. The second stage involved the
usage of simple random sampling to select the dis-
tricts to be used for the study. The third and last stage
involved using simple random sampling technique to
sample the responding communities and households
that were administered with the questionnaires (Asra-
vor, 2020). The multistage sampling procedure was
chosen for this study because the population of the
study was too vast and reaching every farm household
was highly impossible. Furthermore, there is no exist-
ing data on all farm households in the study area and
by extension the whole of Ghana, hence, using the
multistage sampling makes it cost and time effective
since this method helps reduce the population into
smaller groups. The multistage sampling procedures
enabled the researcher to applied various procedures
until the desired sample size is reached. The “sample”
command was used to select households that were
administered with the questionnaire. Though the sam-
ple size that was to be collected at the end of the study
was 940 farm households, as at the time of this study
only 340 questionnaires had been administered. After
the data cleaning and management, 20 questionnaires
were deemed not adequate to be used for the analysis,
hence, only 320 responses from three regions, that is,
110 in the Ashanti and Central region respectively and
the remaining 100 from the Northern region of Ghana
was used for the analysis. Despite this, the 320 sample
size falls within the recommended sample size (Krej-
cie & Morgan, 1970; Asravor, 2020). The 320 ques-
tionnaires were from Eserso and Sawua for the
Ashanti Region; Senya Breko and Odukpong and
Kpehe for the central region; and Buipe and Sakasaka
for the Northern region of Ghana.
Empirical model
Most empirical studies on the decision and participa-
tion in the agricultural market have usually been
undertaken using the “double hurdle” model intro-
duced by Cragg in 1971 (Asravor, 2020; Matshe &
Young, 2004). In the case of the double hurdle, the
first stage of the model est imation was performed4 Information Development XX(X)using either the probit or logit model whereas the
intensity of use was estimated using various estima-
tion techniques (Matshe & Young, 2004), such as the
truncated normal regressions (Bellemare & Barrett,
2006), switching regression model (Goetz, 1992),
among others. Improving on earlier studies, the
empirical model employed to estimate the adoption
and intensity of use of mobile money in Rural Ghana
is the 3-stage hurdle or triple hurdle model. The first
and second stages (hurdles) uses the logit regression
model to assess the determinant of personal mobile
phone ownership and the determinant of usage. The
third hurdle, that is, the intensity of use of mobile
money was analysed using the quasi-poisson regres-
sion model.
Decision to own a mobile phone
The decision to own a mobile phone and the decision
to utilize mobile money are estimated using the logit
model as they share and follow similar principles,
hence, we only present the logit model for the deci-
sion to own a mobile phone. The decision to own a
personal mobile phone (objective 1) by the small-
holder farm household in rural Ghana is modelled as
a dichotomous variable that assumes the value of 1 if
the household head owns a mobile phone and 0
otherwise.
Due to the dichotomous nature of the variable, the
logit or probit regression model can be used in esti-
mating its determinant. As argued by Gujarati (2004)
and Greene (2003) both the probit and logit models
generate similar predicted probabilities even though
they differ in terms of the distribution. Following
Maddala (2001), the probability, P, that a household
owns a mobile phone is given by:
PiYi¼1 ðÞ ¼eXb
1þeXb
Where:
Piis the probability of mobile phone ownership:
Yi¼1: the event that the household head owns a per-
sonal mobile phone; Y i¼0:event that the household
head does not own a personal mobile phone, bis a
vector of parameters, and Xis a vector of the factors
affecting household heads decision to personally own
a mobile phone.
The coefficients of the explanatory variables from
the logit regression model are interpreted as the odds.
Since the coefficients of the explanatory variables
from the logit regression results do not explain theeffect of a unit change in the explanatory variable
on the dependent variable, the marginal effects were
used. The marginal effect measures the effect of a unit
change of an explanatory variable on the dependent
variable. The marginal effect is estimated as follows:
ME¼qfX0b/C0/C1
qX¼fX0b/C16/C17
1/C0fX0b/C16/C17 hi
b
Where:
Xis independent variables matrix in logit model; b
is a matrix of parameters in the logit model. The bin-
ary model is used in this study to analyze the diverse
factors affecting smallhol d e rf a r m e r s ’d e c i s i o n st o
own a mobile phone. Smallholder farmer’s decision
to own a personal mobile phone is of a discrete choice
form (i.e. own, does not own). Specifically, one (1)
denotes smallholder farmers who own a personal
mobile phone. In contrast, zero (0) denotes small-
holder farmers who do not own a personal mobile
phone. The study hypothesized that different factors
affect smallholder farmers’ decision to own mobile
phone.
Assessing the intensity of use of mobile money
services
The intensity of use of mobile money is proxied by the
number of transactions undertaken by the farmers
within the month. The transaction considered in this
study includes sending, receiving money, savings and
paying bills. The number of services used by the small-
holder farm household assumes integer values of a
discrete nature and is, therefore, a nonnegative count
variable. Due to the count nature of the data, the count
model is applied to analyse the intensity of use of
mobile money technology. The two popular regression
models used to analyze count data models are the Pois-
son Regression Model and the Negative Binomial
Regression Model (NBRM) (Winkelmann & Zimmer-
mann, 1995; Greene, 2008). Following Wooldridge
(2002) and Greene (2008), the density function of the
Poisson regression model is specified as follows:
fy ijxiðÞ ¼e/C0lxðÞlixðÞy
G1þyi ðÞ
Where li¼expaþX0b/C0/C1
andyi¼0;1;2;... ;i
is the number/count of mobile money services used;
X¼a vector of predictor variables and aandbare the
parameters to be estimated. The estimated empirical
model has the count of mobile money usage as the
dependent variable and similar explanatory variablesAsravor et al: Adoption and intensity of use of mobile money among smallholder farmers in rural Ghana 5as those of the decision to own a mobile phone and
decision to use mobile money services. The Poisson
regression model is usually associated with the prob-
lem of under-dispersion and over-dispersion. The ini-
tial analysis shows that there is an over-dispersion of
the dataset, hence, the quasi-poisson regression model
is utilised in this study.
Variables and data
The data presented is study is based on rural house-
holds in Ghana. The dependent variables used for the
triple hurdle model are mobile phone ownership,
whether the household head is registered for mobile
money and the intensity of use of mobile money. The
analysis gathered shows that approximately 71 %of
the responding household heads own a personal
mobile phone. In terms of mobile phone registration,
63%of the responding household heads are registered
on mobile money whereas the average number of
times mobile money is used in a month was approx-
imately 3 times per month. The independent variables
used in the study shows that 68 %of the respondents
are males whereas the remaining are females. The age
grouping shows that 29 %of the respondents are
between the age of 18-24 years and 25-31 years. In
addition, 15 %and 13 %of the responding households
are between the age group of 32-38 years and 39-45
years respectively. The analysis also shows that 5 %of
the respondents are between the age of 46-52 years
whereas 9 %are 53 years and above. The educational
level of the household heads sampled for this study
shows that 47 %,2 4%,1 8%,9%and 2 %of the respon-
dents were holders of Junior High School (JHS),
Senior High School (SHS), tertiary, postgraduate and
did not have any educational level respectively. The
marital status of respondents to the study shows that
47%and 32 %of the respondents are married and
single respectively. Furthermore, 17 %and 8 %of the
responding household heads are divorced and coha-
biting. The distance of the respondents’ household to
the market centre and mobile money agent was 2.21
Km and 1.46 Km. Table 1 posits that the distance to
access to electricity was 43 %, whereas 55 %of the
responding household heads are members of the
Farmer-Based Organisation (FBO). The analysis also
shows that farming (49 %), formal office work (21 %),
trading (29 %) and farming and trading (0.6 %) were
the major occupation of the respondents to the study.
On average, there are 6 household members in each
household whereas the acreage of farm size cultivatedby each household head was 3.3 acres. The log of
monthly income of the household heads interviewed
was approximately 5.4.
Results of the study
Although the results of the study show that the inde-
pendent variables were significant at 10 %,5%and 1 %
significance level, the interpretation was made for
variables which were significant at only 5 %and
1%. This is because the 10 %significant level was
deemed as very low to report by the researchers.
1st Hurdle: Ownership of Mobile phone
For the first hurdle, the study report that compared to
the base group (18-24 years), individuals between
the ages of 32-38 years were more likely to own a
personal mobile phone. Furthermore, the statistics
shows that approximately 23 %of divorced persons
are less likely to own a personal mobile phone than
married persons. The result of the study also shows
that a unit increase in the household size of the rural
household will lead to approximately 16 %increase
in the probability that the household head will own a
personal mobile phone. The result also indicated that
household heads with larger farm size were less
likely to own a personal mobile phone. The finding
also shows that there is a 12-percentage point increase
in the likelihood that household heads living closer to a
mobile money agent will own a mobile phone. Access
to electricity was found to be an important determinant
of mobile phone ownership. The finding of the study
shows that having access to electricity results in a
24.5 %chance that the household head will own a per-
sonal mobile phone. The result indicates that occupa-
tion, such as trading, significantly increases the
probability of household heads personally owning a
mobile phone by 17-percentage point. The percentage
increase in the income of the household head is asso-
ciated with a 2 %increase in the ownership of the
mobile phone in Ghana.
2nd Hurdle: Decision to register for Mobile money
Several factors influence the decision of household
heads to register for mobile money. The results as pre-
sented in Table 2 shows that compared to heads between
the ages of 18 to 24 years, heads who were 53 years and
above, were less likely to register for mobile money (as
indicated by the 22.8 %). In terms of education, the
results of the study show that compared to household6 Information Development XX(X)heads who have JHS certificate, heads with no educa-
tion were less likely to registered for with any of the
telecommunication for their mobile money services(this is represented by the coefficient of the marginal
effect of 41.8 %). The result also shows that compared to
married couples, households where heads are single,Table 1. Descriptive statistics of the dependent and independent variables.

8divorced, and cohabiting had heads less willing to reg-
istered for mobile money services.
On the contrary, the study report that a unit
increase in the household size leads to a 7.9 per cent
increase in the probability that the household head
will register for mobile money service. At 5 %signif-
icant level, the study can conclude that a unit increase
in farm size is associated with a 2.5 %decrease in the
tendency of the head registering for mobile money
services in Ghana. The findings also show that at
1%significance level, the closer the head is located
to a mobile money agent, the more likely that the head
would be registered on the mobile money platform. In
addition, the results indicate that household heads
who are formal office workers are more likely to reg-
ister with mobile money compared to household
heads who are into only farming. The significance
level was 1 %and the coefficient of the marginal
effect was 27.6 %as indicated by the findings.
The result also shows that at 1 %significance level,
there is a 76 %probability that household heads who
are into both farming and trading are more likely to
register with mobile money than heads who are into
only farming activities. In term of location, the find-
ing of the study shows that compared to the Esereso
community, communitie s such as Senya Breku,
Odukpong Kpehe, and Sakasaka are less likely to
register with mobile money. The study also shows
that a percentage increase in the income of the house-
hold head will lead to a 2.1 %increase in the likeli-
hood that the household head will register on the
mobile money platform.
3rd Hurdle: Intensity of usage of Mobile money
Table 2 also shows that results of the Poisson model
use to assess the intensity of use of mobile money. It is
important to note that the initial model using the pois-
son regression showed that there was over dispersion,
hence, the quasi-poisson regression was run to correct
this problem. The result shows that compared to those
between the ages of 18 to 24 years, all age group
except for those between the ages 46 to 52 years were
more likely to increase their intensity of mobile
money usage. Thus, there was a 1 %statistically sig-
nificant level that heads between the age groups 25-31
years, 32-38 years, 39-45 years and 53 and above
were more likely to increase their mobile usage by
55.8 %, 89.9 %, 122.4 %and 137.4 %respectively.
In terms of education, the study reports a 1 %statis-
tically significant level for the intensity of usage ofmobile money by household heads who have their
highest level of education as SHS and tertiary level
while a 5 %significant level was reported for heads
with postgraduate and no formal education. The
detailed analysis shows that compared to heads with
JHS as their highest level of education, heads with
SHS, tertiary level of education, postgraduate and no
education were more likely to increase their intensity of
use of mobile money. The analysis shows that house-
hold heads who are divorced are more likely to increase
the intensity of mobile money usage compared to mar-
ried household heads, whereas cohabiting heads were
found to decrease the intensity of their mobile money
usage compared to heads who are married.
In addition, the result of the study shows that a unit
increase in household size and farm size is associated
with a 51.9 %and 20.7 %increase in the intensity of
mobile money usage among household heads in the
study area. The analysis of the intensity results pre-
sented in Table 2, shows that the longer the distance
of the household head’s home is from the mobile
money agent, the less likely the intensity of use
mobile money. Also, households who have access to
electricity are more likely to increase the intensity of
use of mobile money. At 1 %significance level, a
member who belongs to a farmer-based organisation
is more likely to increase t heir intensity of use of
mobile money by approximately 50 %.
The analysis in terms of the type of occupation the
household head is engaged in shows that when com-
pared to the households that are into only farming
activities, household heads working as formal office
workers and those into both farming and trading are
more likely to increase their intensity of the usage of
mobile money. In terms of location, household heads
located in Sakasaka are more likely to increase the
intensity of use of mobile money compared to those
located in Sawua. Notwithstanding this, household
heads located in Senya Breko were less likely to
increase the intensity of use of mobile money com-
pared to households located in Esereso. The analysis
also shows that a percentage increase in household
income will lead to a 2.5 %increase in the intensity
of use of mobile money.
Discussion of Findings
Hurdle 1 and Hurdle 2: Ownership of Mobile phone
and Decision to register for mobile money
Age significantly influences the decision of the
household head to own a mobile phone. Heads in theirAsravor et al: Adoption and intensity of use of mobile money among smallholder farmers in rural Ghana 9youth years (32-38 years) were found to increase their
desire to own a mobile phone. Furthermore, the deci-
sion to register for mobile money decreases among
the youngest (25-31 years) and oldest (53 years and
above) household heads. Given their limited income,
older household heads might not have the zeal to
register for mobile money since they are usually
scared about the security of such as a platform. Sim-
ilar to older household heads, younger household
heads are also cautious with money since the majority
just started working and earning income, hence, are
less willing to register with the mobile money plat-
form. This makes such household heads less willing to
take up new and modern technology. According to
Zins and Weill (2016) getting older is directly asso-
ciated with the probability of being either formally or
informally financially included, until a certain age
after which the probability reduces. The finding of
this study is largely in line with those reported by Zins
and Weill (2016).
Despite divorced household heads being highly
likely to own a personal mobile phone, household
heads who have never been married (single household
heads) and those who are divorced were less likely to
register for mobile money. This result does not align
with the findings of Tugume et al. (2015) who found
that marital status could increase the probability that a
consumer will use mobile money services, hence, by
extension will register for mobile money.
Education is seen as an essential tool towards the
household heads ability to operate a mobile phone.
According to Munyegera and Matsumoto (2016), the
low level of mobile phone ownership among house-
hold heads with a lower level of education in the rural
areas of developing countries could partially be due to
the literacy effect. Many of these household heads do
not have any formal level of education, implying that
such heads might not be able to read and write text
messages. This negatively affects the willingness of
household heads to own a mobile phone.
Increasing household size is associated with an
increase in mobile phone usage and an influential part
of the decision of the household heads to register for
mobile money. This finding is consistent with the
finding of Apiors and Suzuki (2016) who reported
that household size is a significant variable that posi-
tively affects the probability of using mobile money.
This is because household heads might receive some
remittances from children working in the city or
might personally send money to a member of his fam-
ily who is living outside the household or in a distantcommunity. Households with larger farm size
decrease their ownership of mobile phone and the
registration of mobile money. This contradicts the
findings of Kikulwe, Fischer, and Qaim (2014) who
reported that each additional acre of land owned
increases the probability of mobile money registration
and usage. In the case of the Ghanaian rural commu-
nities, more acreage of land cultivated implies that
more resources must be devoted to the cultivation of
more farmlands. This implies that fewer resources are
available for such household heads hence the limited
registration of mobile money by such heads.
Trading is an essential part of the rural economy
where blue-collar jobs are virtually non-existence.
Mobile phone ownership is, therefore, essential as it
helps these heads keep up with their customers and
clients. Mobile phones are used as a medium of com-
munication and keeping in touch with customers and
potential customers. The finding of this study signif-
icantly shows that formal office workers are more
inclined to register on the mobile money platform
than non-formal office workers. In Ghana, the nature
of most formal office work does not permit individu-
als the luxury of moving and conducting certain finan-
cial transactions. The mobile money platform,
therefore, serves as an easier means of conducting
certain financial transactions. The significance of the
decision to register for mobile money at the commu-
nity level is largely influenced by the number of
household heads owning a personal mobile phone at
the various villages sampled. This shows that there is
a positive effect on the decision to register with
mobile on the mobile money platform (Maertens &
Barrett, 2013; Kikulwe, Fischer, & Qaim, 2014).
Additionally, The World Bank (2015) study of Kenya
indicates that mobile money is largely used for pay-
ments, especially by formal workers who are limited
in terms of free movement from work to conduct
nonwork-related activities. Once household heads can
easily access mobile money agents, it is very easy for
such household heads to register for mobile money.
This is because such household heads do not have to
travel longer distances to access mobile money from
their mobile money account. Thus, proximity to a
mobile money agent serves as an incentive to register
for mobile money services.
Higher-income is positively associated with the
decision of the household head to own a mobile
phone. This is because household heads with higher
income can easily afford to buy a mobile phone. The
mobile phone is, therefore, seen by such individuals10 Information Development XX(X)as a necessity rather than a luxury. The higher per-
centage of households in the various communities
owning mobile phones shows that the neighbourhood
effect is real. This result suggests the social networks
and associated knowledge transfer play a significant
role for when it comes to the adoption of innovation
(Maertens & Barrett, 2013). Households with access
to electricity can charge their phone and use it for
other activities, rather than walking long distances
to charge their phones.
Hurdle 3: Intensity of usage of mobile money
The age groupings have a significant impact on the
intensity of usage of mobile money. Heads, especially
those 53 years and older have a larger intensity of use
because of remittances. Thus, they might have chil-
dren outside the villages who might be remitting
money to them. Furthermore, they might also be send-
ing money to their school-going children who are in
the boarding school. Munyegera and Matsumoto
(2016) argued that the intensity of use of mobile
money is because educated household heads are more
able to send their children to school who, upon gra-
duation, find jobs in towns and extend financial assis-
tance in the form of remittances through mobile
money platforms.
Furthermore, the intensity of mobile money usage
was positively associated with the educational level of
the household heads. With the mobile money plat-
form, individuals can perform numerous transactions
without necessarily walking or going to financial
institutions. To perform such mobile money transac-
tion without the help of agents, other friends and rela-
tives, household heads must have some minimal level
of education since mobile money activities involve
some level of reading and typing (Kikulwe, Fischer,
& Qaim, 2014).
The study also found that the intensity of use of
mobile money was higher for formal office workers
and heads engaged in both farming and trading. As
indicated by Kikulwe, Fischer, and Qaim (2014), in
Kenya, the intensity of mobile money use contributes
to the higher farming intensity and profits, and higher
commercially-oriented farming. In Ghana, mobile
money has replaced formal banking institutions in
rural areas since most farming household can sell their
goods and transact businesses with it.
Land in rural communities is a measure of wealth,
hence, household heads with much land are said to be
wealthy household heads who can afford to increasetheir intensity of payment and receiving cash using
the mobile money payment system. Household heads
who have access to electricity increase their intensity
of usage of mobile money services. Similar findings
have been reported in the empirical literature. For
instance, Aron (2017) posited that corruption, lack
of electricity generation, and appalling road infra-
structure are significant factors affecting mobile
money registration and intensity of usages and signif-
icant factors among the failures. In Ghana, especially
in rural communities, most mobile money agents are
located in the rural communities, hence, increase in
the distance to the market centre will result in the
situation where households heads will have to trek
long distances to assess mobile money services. This
will serve as a disincentive to household heads inten-
sity to use such services.
The closer the location of the mobile money agent
is to the household head, the higher the intensity of the
usage of the mobile money platform according to the
findings of the study. This corrobborates the findings
of Suri and Jack (2016), who reported that in Kenya,
heads who can access mobile money agents within a
1-km radius increase household savings between
2–3%and also the intensity of the usage of the plat-
form. Furthermore, the intensity of mobile money was
higher for individuals with higher income levels.
Thus, individuals who have more cash are more likely
to use more of the mobile money platform, for either
transferring, saving or using the mobile money plat-
form to pay their bills. A similar finding has been
reported by Apiors and Suzuki (2018) who reported
that increasing total financial assets, a symbol of
wealth and income, is likely to increase the individu-
al’s volume of mobile money transaction by approx-
imately 0.19 %.
The household size increases the intensity of
mobile money usage among household heads because
such households have the head sending or receiving
money from household members for various pur-
poses. For instance, household members who travel
to the city send money during funeral and important
occasions to their household heads to contribute on
their behalf, whereas those in boarding houses also
receive remittance or “chop money” from their heads.
The distance to the market centre decreases the inten-
sity of use of mobile money services in the cases of
the rural communities in Ghana. The reason for this is
because most mobile money agents are located at the
market centre and most market centres are further
away from the houses of these heads. Thus, there isAsravor et al: Adoption and intensity of use of mobile money among smallholder farmers in rural Ghana 11an element of travelling cost associated with acces-
sing mobile money agents. This cost decreases the
number of times or the intensity of mobile money
services usage by the household heads. Finally, mem-
bership of FBO increase s the intensity of use of
mobile money by household heads. This is because
in many cases FBO members contribute towards a
member’s funeral or their monthly dues as is the case
of FBOs in Ghana. Many of these transactions are
undertaken using mobile money.
Conclusion and Policy Implication
This study examined the factors influencing the adop-
tion and intensity of use of mobile money by small-
holder farmers in rural Ghana using the triple hurdle
model, the logit and the quasi-poisson model. The
study concludes that the decision to own a mobile
phone (first hurdle) is driven by household size, mar-
ital status, the farm size, access to electricity, income
status and the type of occupation engaged in by the
household head. The study also concludes that in the
case of the second hurdle, the decision to register on
the mobile money platform is influenced by the age,
educational status, mari tal status, household size,
farm size and the type of occupation engaged in by
the household head. In addition, the location of the
household head significantly influences the decision
of the household head to register for mobile money
services. In the case of the third hurdle, that is, the
intensity of usage of mobile money services, the study
concludes that age of the household head, higher edu-
cational level, marital status of the household head,
household and farm size, as well as the distance of the
household heads from the mobile money agent,
directly influences the intensity of use of mobile
money services by household heads. Furthermore, the
intensity of use of mobile money is influenced by
access to electricity at home and working in a formal
occupation or undertaking both farming and trading
activities. The location of the household head also
significantly influenced the decision of the household
head’s intensity to use mobile money services.
The overall implication of the findings of this study
is that strategies that promote household heads’
access to electricity and occupation in the formal sec-
tor or both farming and trading in the rural commu-
nities should be taken into consideration by
policymakers (Ministry o f Communication) when
designing policy to encourage mobile money usage.
The reach of the mobile industry’s infrastructure, thegrowing traction of mobile financial services and
the increasing opportunity to leverage machine-to-
machine (M2M) connectivity, offer innovative
pathways to achieve reliable energy access for under-
served communities. Increasing access to electricity
will increase mobile phone ownership and mobile
money registration and usage, since heads with access
to electricity do not have to walk long distances to
charge their mobile phones. Furthermore, attention
from the mobile money service providers and policy-
makers should be focussed on location, farmers and
farm characteristics as they significantly influence the
owner’s decision to register and the intensity of
mobile money service usage on the rural farm house-
holds. Finally, the study suggests that rural house-
holds should be encouraged to join farmer-based
organisations (FBO) since it does not only increase
their capacity and knowledge, but it also increases
their decision to register and use mobile money
services.
