Backgr ound: The corona virus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is the biggest global economic and health challenge of the century .
Its effect and impact are still evolving, with deaths estimated to reach 40 million if uncheck ed. One effective and complementary
strate gy to slow the spread and reduce the impact is to trace the primary and secondary contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases
using contact tracing technology .
Objecti ve: The objecti ve of this paper is to survey strate gies for digital contact tracing for the COVID-19 pandemic and to
present how using mobile positioning data conforms with Nigeria’ s data privacy regulations.
Methods: We conducted an exploratory review of current measures for COVID-19 contact tracing implemented around the
world. We then analyzed how countries are using mobile positioning data technology to reduce the spread of COVID-19. We
made recommendations on how Nigeria can adopt this approach while adhering to the guidelines provided by the National Data
Protection Regulation (NDPR).
Results: Despite the potential of digital contact tracing, it always conflicts with patient data privacy regulations. We found that
Nigeria’ s response complies with the NDPR, and that it is possible to leverage call detail records to complement current strate gies
within the NDPR.
Conclusions: Our study shows that mobile position data contact tracing is important for epidemic control as long as it conforms
to relevant data privacy regulations. Implementation guidelines will limit data misuse.

Introduction
The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe
acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV -2) [1].
This infectious respiratory disease was first detected in WuhanCity, China, in December 2019. It was declared a global
pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March
11, 2020, and has currently infected over two million people
worldwide and has killed over 150,000 people. Globally ,
responses have been swift and in full influenza pandemic control

RenderXmode [2]. Travel and movement restrictions to curtail spread
both within and across cities are in force. Many cities around
the world are in lockdo wn or lock-in mode. Some have issued
dusk-to-da wn curfe ws. In other scenarios, large gatherings have
either been banned or discouraged. Estimates suggest that this
pandemic can claim the lives of as many as 40 million people
globally [3]. The Spanish flu, which lasted between 1918 and
1920 in some places, has been estimated to have cost the lives
of 21-50 million people globally [4]. Evidence suggests that
influenzas can mainly be spread through large clusters [5]. The
WHO global influenza preparedness plan presents guidelines
for the management and control of influenza and other disease
[6]. Nigeria, one of the countries that adopts WHO guidelines,
has over 493 cases of COVID-19 as of April 17, 2020, with 17
mortalities. This is a substantial increase since the index case
was reported on February 27, 2020. To better manage the spread,
Nigeria’ s federal government has declared a lockdo wn in key
affected states (ie, Lagos, Ogun, and the Federal Capital
Territory). The lockdo wn was in addition to several mitig ating
actions by state governments, ranging from a ban on social
gatherings to dusk-to-da wn curfe ws. During the lockdo wn,
schools, mark ets, churches, mosques, banks, offices, parks,
motor parks, and airports remain closed, often for a 14-day
period.
The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) reported that
it is currently conducting contact tracing of over 9000 contacts
of confirmed cases in an attempt to effectively contain the spread
of the disease, in line with the recommended measures for
pandemic response [7,8]. These measures include antiviral,
vaccine, and nonpharmaceutical measures such as case isolation,
household quarantine, school or workplace closure, and travel
restrictions. Given the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic,
nonpharmaceutical actions appear to be the only practical and
logical option in the absence of any known antiviral drug or
vaccine. Resources are stretched even in countries with advanced
health care systems, as seen in Italy, the United Kingdom, China,
and the United States [9,10].
Although the NCDC's approach has been commended for its
compliance with WHO guidelines for large-scale containment
and contact tracing, there remain options that may yet beexplored [11]. Given the inadequac y of testing kits, it is belie ved
that the number of confirmed cases may be far lower than the
actual number of cases in Nigeria and most African countries.
This is fueling speculations of a real, catastrophic-le vel
pandemic if isolation, containment, quarantine, and
contact-tracing mechanisms are not urgently implemented. In
a country with an already weak health care system occasioned
by poor health investment choices, managing such an outbreak
will become impossible.
There is, therefore, a need to develop and adopt new strate gies,
particularly digitally-enabled strate gies, to facilitate a more
extensi ve, accurate, seamless, and timely response in line with
the high frequenc y of new infections among contacts of
confirmed cases (ie, the secondary infection rate) [12]. The
adoption of digital solutions in Nigeria has been focused on
electronic forms for contact data collection and visualization
for follow-up [13]. Digital technologies can do more than be a
tool for field data collection or serve as an outbreak investigation
platform. Data on households and general population movement
patterns can be extracted through digital technologies [14].
Farrahi et al [15] showed that over a 9-month period, 72
participants made 10,992 phone calls and 9432 SMS records
representing communication flow; additionally , these
participants made 1,973,547 Bluetooth interactions representing
physical proximity movements. When extrapolated for three
cases in Abuja, the capital city of Nigeria, their movement can
result in thousands of interactions. In the case of an infection,
these three cases can initiate an exponential number of contacts
through these interactions, as seen in Figure 1A. The registered
quarantine address can be visualized on the map and movement
of quarantine subjects can be monitored with notifications
enabled (Figure 1B).
Our paper reviews global practices in the use of mobile
positioning data to achie ve a more targeted and efficient
approach at contact tracing and disease surveillance, especially
in the conte xt of the COVID-19 pandemic. We discuss how this
approach is possible within regulatory confines. We also
recommend a novel strate gy for coordinating agencies to
leverage mobile positioning data, and how to ensure patient
privacy is preserv ed.

RenderXMethods
The COVID-19 pandemic is emer ging and only three months
old with little scholarly work to justify a systematic search,
review, and analysis approach. We conducted an exploratory
(nonsystematic) internet search for technology approaches and
responses to COVID-19. Results from global and national
agencies responsible for infection prevention and control were
analyzed to ascertain how they currently use technology . We
also reviewed how these use cases fit within the regulatory
frame work for contact tracing and isolation. A similar internet
search methodology was adopted for Nigeria’ s response and its
use of digital tools for contact tracing.
Results
Our search yielded results based on emer ging trends and the
use of digital technologies by countries around the world to
respond to COVID-19. We first present global perspecti ves and
response strate gies on the use of mobile position data during
previous and current pandemics. We then present Nigeria’ s
approach.
Mobile Position Data: How It Works
The GSM Association puts the total number of mobile
subscribers at 5 billion unique subscribers and 7 billion
connected devices [16]. Nigeria has 184 million active mobilesubscriber lines [17]. Mobile telecommunications subscriber
communication and movement data was used for contact tracing
during the Ebola outbreak [14]. Many countries are currently
using mobile data for a more rapid response to the COVID-19
pandemic [18,19]. There has been a 90% increase in the number
of countries implementing digital tracking measures and a 100%
increase in reports of censorship [20]. These approaches range
from the use of anon ymized aggre gate data to monitor the
general mobility of people and track the mobile phones of
confirmed cases to tracking suspected patients and their contacts.
In some cases, these approaches were individualized and
mandatory while, in others, they were aggre gated and
anon ymized. In all cases, there were collaborations between the
government, mobile netw ork operators (MNOs), and other data
controllers such as technology companies and financial services
providers.
At any time, each mobile subscriber is connected to a segment
of the MNO base station tower. For simplicity , we have
presented a cell tower and a subscriber in Figure 2. We used
letters A and B to illustrate the farthest and shortest distance of
the subscriber from the base station tower based on power
throughput and internal cell tower position triangulation. The
difference between A and B, representing the diameter of a
user’ s device, which is a proxy for the user’ s location, often
ranges between 50 and 300 meters, but depends other factors
[14].

Global Strategies
Table 1details some of the strate gies governments around the
world are adopting to track and isolate COVID-19 patients and
their contacts or for lockdo wn/lock-in enforcement. In the
United States, US $500 million of the US $2 trillion economic
stimulus bill recently signed into law has been allocated to the
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to launch a new
surveillance and data collection system to monitor the spread
of COVID-19 [21]. This move is a first for the United States
since stringent patient data privacy and security regulationshave hampered the adoption of contact tracing as a
countermeasure for epidemic control in the past [22]. Similarly ,
the state of Massachusetts has announced the launch of what it
calls the “first contact tracing” call center with 1000 virtual
assistants to call and trace contacts of COVID-19-positi ve
persons [23].
The European Union’ s General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) is being tested on a large scale. Within the regulation,
a patient can decide not to disclose who they have been in
contact with or legally resist being traced [24]. Evidence has
emer ged that German y, Austria, and Italy are using aggre gated

RenderXcall detail records (CDRs) to enforce lockdo wn and stay-at-home
policies [25]. As this is an evolving challenge and European
countries such as Italy and France are amongst the worst
affected, changes to the GDPR regulations are expected and
anticipated.
In China, the government worked with telecommunications
companies to track and contact people who had traveled through
Hubei province during the early days of the disease outbreak.
Location data was shared with China's National Health
Commission and other agencies, enabling them to
retrospecti vely simulate the location of confirmed cases and
their contacts, who were then issued warnings via social media[26]. Information has also emer ged that the Chinese government
may have leveraged its large netw ork of sensors and surveillance
cameras supported by an artificial intelligence–po wered facial
recognition and recommender system in its response to the
COVID-19 outbreak [27]. This success may not be unconnected
with the often criticized and loose patient data privacy and
security regulation in China.
It was, however, observ ed that the extent of compliance with
international and country-le vel regulations regarding data
privacy considerations in deplo ying this digital technology
varied from country to country .
Table 1. Strate gies planned or adopted by countries for the use of mobile positioning data in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Strate gy planned or adopted Country
The state of Massachusetts announced the launch of its first contact tracing call center to be manned by 1000
virtual assistants [23]. The US federal government announced a US $500 million package for COVID-19
surveillance for the CDC [21].United States [21]
A mandatory smartphone app “Health code” that leverages a mesh netw ork for infected persons contact
tracing and notification.China [22,28]
Telecommunications providers allow for the sharing of location data with health authorities to check whether
people are remaining at home. The data is aggre gated and anon ymous, mapping concentrations rather than
individuals to respect Europe’ s privacy laws.Italy, German y, and Austria [25]
The government created a map of cell phone data provided by telecommunications and credit card companies.
The map was made public, so everyone could track their level of exposure.South Korea [29]
The government is using GMS call detail records in addition to patient mobile phone position data to locate
contacts and trace their movement patterns.Israel [19]
Iranian authorities developed a mobile app with government endorsement for COVID-19 self-diagnosis
checks. It, however, also discretely collects user’ s location data.Iran [30]
Singapore is using a mobile app that uses a Bluetooth-based mesh netw ork to detect people's proximity to
those who have been exposed to COVID-19 and warns them to get tested if they come in close contact.Singapore [18,21]
The Nigerian Strategy
Human travel patterns and mobility can be assessed using
available mobile phone data, and its application can be useful
in disease epidemiology [31]. Panigutti et al [31] also revealed
the adequac y of mobile phone data for tracking infectious
disease spread, particularly in heavily populated and highly
interconnected communities.
Border restrictions, internal travel restrictions, and school
closures or total lockdo wn are reasonable but have minimal
impact compared to effective case isolation or quarantine, which
have been shown to have a signif icant impact if properly
conducted [2]. This is particularly important in Nigeria’ s case,
where total compliance to these strate gies cannot be guaranteed.
Therefore, data on case isolation and quarantine should be a
signif icant priority in Nigeria. Moreo ver, data is useful in
modeling disease transmission. Specif ically , collecting and
analyzing data on transmission in different social conte xts is
highly effective in mapping interv ention strate gies since the
impact of case isolation and quarantine depends on reducing
contact between unaffected individuals and the index and other
cases while they are ill [2].
In order for the NCDC to effectively conduct the current
large-scale contact tracing of over 9000 contacts of confirmed
cases, use of digital technology is inevitable. The number ofcontacts may even be more than this number considering the
frequenc y of new infections. Currently , there are several digital
contact data capture solutions, including the Surveillance ,
Outbr eak Response Mana gement and Analysis System
(SORMAS). These solutions require a field epidemiologist or
their representati ve to visit every contact.
Discussion
Principal Findings
Evidence suggests that contact tracing and data protection can
go together [32]. Signif icant progress is being made with current
strate gies. As promising as they may seem, data privacy
concerns remain a major impediment; it is necessary to find a
balance between deplo ying the technology and maintaining data
safety and patient privacy. Existing patient privacy regulations
are currently being tested. Some countries have attempted to
relax existing stringent regulations that protect patient privacy
to allow for greater access; others have worked around them.
According to Woods [21], many of the new digital technology
approaches appear inevitable and legitimate, given the
unprecedented high frequenc y of the COVID-19 infection
spread. Many countries have now also invoked speedy
legislati ve processes to give legitimac y to their workarounds
and deplo yments.

RenderXIn Israel, for instance, the cabinet has passed an emer gency law
to use mobile data for tracking people infected with COVID-19,
trace their contacts, and identify individuals for quarantine [19].
This law was passed overnight, bypassing parliamentary
appro val. In the United States, privacy advocates are proposing
stringent procedures to keep personal information safe, including
deletion, once the data are no longer in use to prevent abuse by
law enforcement agents [21].
The National Data Protection Regulation (NDPR) of Nigeria
was promulg ated in 2019 [33]. Amongst other stipulations, the
regulation outlines the guiding principles for data processing
in Section 5. These principles consider data processing unlawful
if there is no consent by the individual data subjects (in this
case, the confirmed persons), if it is inaccurate with prejudice
to human dignity and not protected against cybercrime, and if
it is stored beyond a reasonable period of time. However, despite
these guiding principles, Section 6, part 2.0, subsection 2.2 (e)
of the document lists the conditions for lawful data processing
and states that:
Processing is necessary for the performance of a task
carried out in the public interest or the exercise of
official public mandate vested in the contr oller.
The data controller in the case of mobile positioning data is the
MNO, the entity that determines the purposes for and the manner
in which netw ork subscriber phone data is processed or is to be
processed. Section 11 of the regulation states that data
processing by a third party (eg, a public authority such as the
Federal Ministry of Health, the NCDC, or anybody engaged in
processing the location data such as a technology compan y)
shall be governed by a written contract with the data controller .
Interestingly , though the NDPR protects the privacy of personal
mobile location data, it also provides exceptions for the use of
such data that override public interest, such as the current
COVID-19 outbreak.
Recommendations
Mobile phone location data can be effectively utilized in Nigeria
for COVID-19 response. The government can leverage existing
mobile technology resources and infrastructure available
in-country by working with MNOs and technology firms to
optimize the ongoing contact tracing and surveillance of over
9000 known contacts of confirmed cases. This collaboration
should be guided by the NDPR in order to protect and safeguard
individuals' data, prevent a breach of data privacy rights as well
as inappropriate use and abuse by law enforcement agencies
beyond the period of contact tracing and surveillance.
In practice, however, the first step should involve anon ymized
mobile subscriber data in line with good data governance polic y.In the spirit of goodwill, informed consent of confirmed cases
should be appropriately obtained once they are diagnosed,
whene ver possible. The use of the public interest exception
should be a last resort. A simplif ied guideline for these processes
for adhering to the NDPR should be written and made
transparently available for data custodians, requesting bodies,
data handlers, and the patient or contact.
A third-party agreement should also be formally signed between
parties interf acing with patient data in any way. A typical use
case sensiti ve to data privacy concerns is the use of information
only regarding visits to public facilities, including public
transportation systems, parks, churches, mosques, or malls, by
COVID-19-positi ve individuals, as described by Ohmukai et
al [34]. The use of CDRs has been proven to be effective in
detecting outbreak clusters, followed by the use of other
frontline data collection tools for mitig ating impact and
containment [14]. A key limitation of using CDRs from MNOs
is that for basic 2G (second generation) phone users, the location
will rely on mobile netw ork phone mast location triangulation
only. This approach alone has a proximity accurac y of 50-300
meters. This accurac y level is not sufficient to identify persons
who have been in contact with a COVID-19 patient since the
WHO contact definition prescribes two meters [7]. The use of
telecommunication CDRs should complement other strate gies
for effective results.
The immediate action after a successful contact trace is
communicating the expected course of action to citizens of an
infected community cluster . A simple, user-friendly interf ace
using Unstructured Supplementary Service Data will help
impro ve information requests and management for low-income
but literate users. Interacti ve voice response technology will be
suitable and appropriate for awareness response for low-literate
users in their local language.
Conclusions
Mobile positioning data can signif icantly impro ve the capacity
and scope of timely outbreak response and will help
governments as well as other responders in Nigeria. When
implemented early [15], there are opportunities to leverage
positioning data to break the chains of disease transmission in
community clusters. It can impro ve the efficienc y of currently
used field data collection and outbreak investig ation platforms
when used in syner gy.
While mobile positioning data can be used within the current
regulation, guidelines for data handlers must include measures
to curtail misuse and unauthorized access. Future research
should design and implement models for mobile position contact
tracing.
