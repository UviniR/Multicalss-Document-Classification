Abstract: Digital technology plays an important role in achieving many of the Sustainable Development
Goals. However, access is uneven, with 80% of those in high-income countries being online compared
to 20% of those in the 47 least developed countries. This study aimed to describe and analyse
adolescents‚Äô access to and usage of digital technology in Guinea-Bissau and its implications. In June
2017, a survey with a locally adapted Planet Youth questionnaire was implemented in the capital,
Bissau, whereby classes in 16 secondary schools were surveyed on a variety of issues. In total,
2039 randomly selected students participated; the survey included ten questions speciÔ¨Åcally on
the access to and use of digital technology. Half of the respondents had access to desktop /laptops,
and one-third used mobile internet daily; about two-thirds had an experience of social media.
Explanatory variables included educational institution, parental education, economic situation,
and gender. Furthermore, students‚Äô experience of social media was signiÔ¨Åcantly linked to bullying,
anxiety, depression, smoking and alcohol consumption. Many adolescents in Bissau have no
experience of using digital technology, including for schoolwork. Access improvements are necessary
so that young Bissau-Guineans are not to be left behind in developing their capabilities and can
beneÔ¨Åt from proÔ¨Åciency in the use of digital technologies. At the same time, potential harmful usage
of the media requires the implementation of preventive measures.

1. Introduction
With the launch of the Sustainable Development Goals 2016‚Äì2030 (SDGs), world leaders pledged
to leave no one behind and called for integrated action across sectors to tackle complex development
challenges [ 1]. Since its adoption, adolescents have increasingly been in focus for global health policy to
support the ‚ÄòSDG generation‚Äô to realise their rights to health, wellbeing, education and full participation
in society, and thereby enable them to attain their full potential as adults [2‚Äì5].
The focus on youth is important for several reasons. First and foremost, this generation will be
the world leaders of the future, making important political and economic decisions which impact
global development. Secondly, the number of people aged 10‚Äì24 is the largest in history, standing at
over 1.8 billion as of 2016 [ 6]. Thirdly, adolescents are ‚Äúbiologically, emotionally and developmentally
primed for engagement beyond their families and the media, in particular social media, o ers that
opportunity‚Äù [ 7,8]. Digital technology plays an important role in achieving the SDGs, not only through
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 8937; doi:10.3390 /ijerph17238937 www.mdpi.com /journal /ijerphInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 8937 2 of 21
Goal 9 (Industry, innovation, and infrastructure), but as a driver for the fulÔ¨Ålment of all the goals. This is
important for young people who currently are the most connected demographic globally, with 71% of
15‚Äì24-year-olds being online, compared to 48% of the total population, and those under the age of
18 making up around one-third of all internet users around the world [ 9]. However, global access is
uneven, causing a digital divide [ 9‚Äì11]; African youth are the most disconnected in the world, with over
60% not being online, compared to just 4% of those in Europe [ 9]. Nonetheless, the proportion of
Africans with internet access is growing rapidly, from 0.02% in 1998 to 10% in 2010 [ 12], and 28% in
2019 [ 13]. Inequality remains a challenge [ 14] and must be addressed for the achievement of the SDGs;
in 2019, about 34% of African men had access to the internet compared to 23% of females [13].
1.1. Uses of Digital Technology‚ÄîPros and Cons
Digital technology refers to the use of mobile phone devices, computers /laptops with and without
internet capabilities and social media that is accessed on those devices. There is an array of literature
outlining what it is that youth across the world are using these modern devices to do, as well as the
positive and negative consequences of these uses.
Commonly mentioned positive usages of digital technology among adolescents include
communicating with friends and family [ 15‚Äì17], identity building [ 10,18,19], educational purposes [ 9,20],
Ô¨Ånding information [ 21,22], entertainment [ 16,17], and job hunting [ 15,23]. Lesser mentioned positives
include spreading awareness of world issues and increased activism [ 24,25] and promoting tourism in
their countries [ 26]. Negative usages include cyberbullying [ 9,10,23], worries over a ‚Äúbedroom culture‚Äù
being formed with adolescents staying in their rooms roaming the internet [ 9], and increasing fears
over the morale of adolescents with speciÔ¨Åc reference to body-image [ 7,9]. Its usage also facilitates the
promotion of unhealthy lifestyle choices and unwanted sexual content [9,23], and gambling [27].
In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the literature on how digital technologies are accessed
overwhelmingly highlight mobile devices being used and owned more commonly than computers or
laptops [ 12,13,26]. Although computers are important tools for internet usage, mobile phones o er
access to a more varied audience. One common trend that inÔ¨Çuences the preference of phones over
computers is the concept of phone sharing, whereby many individuals (friends or family) share usage
of one handset, often switching out SIM cards for their own [ 17,19,28]. Furthermore, the number of
mobile money service subscribers is increasing rapidly across SSA [29].
1.2. Determinants and Barriers to Usage
Determinants for access to di erent forms of digital technologies include gender, education levels
of adolescents and rural /urban habitation. These, among other reasons, create what has been dubbed
‚Äúdigital divides‚Äù that mirror prevailing economic gaps [ 9]. Compared to African youth where over 60%
are not online [ 9], 90% of adolescents in the USA used at least one form of social media [ 30] and 92% of
adolescents aged 14‚Äì16 years used it for at least 30 min each day in Iceland [ 31]. Furthermore, globally
there is a gender gap of 17% with more males using the internet than females, as of 2019, and has
increased by 6% compared to 2013 [ 13]. Although most countries in Africa are reporting large gender
gaps, South Africa appears to be the one country in the region that is closing the gender gap [ 19,23].
Furthermore, a higher proportion of people living in urban areas of African countries reported usage
of digital technologies, compared with those living in rural areas [16,17,32].
Concerning intangible barriers that are blocking access to technology, one main obstacle to digital
technology adoption is cost. High prices of technology compared to average incomes within SSA are
well known [ 11,15,28,33]. Besides, poor infrastructure across the continent, especially in rural SSA,
hinders accessibility. Finally, other barriers to usage include a lack of digital skills on the continent and
large proportions of the population speaking minority languages; the majority of the content available
online is in major languages that are not always understood in some parts of the world [9].Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 8937 3 of 21
1.3. Background to Study
Guinea-Bissau is a low-income country located in west Africa, ranked as 178 out of 189 in the Human
Development Index 2019 [ 34], 173 out of 182 countries on the Kids Rights Index 2020 [ 35], and belongs
to a group of fragile states [ 36,37]. It became independent in 1974 after 11 years of the liberation
war against the Portuguese. The country su ered from a military-political conÔ¨Çict in 1998‚Äì1999 and
has since been characterised by political instability [ 36,38‚Äì42] with links to narco-tra cking [ 43].
The Bissau-Guinean population is estimated to be around 1.9 million and is rapidly growing, with the
capital Bissau as the most populous area where about a quarter of them live [ 44]. About 40% are
aged 0‚Äì14 years and one-third of young people aged 10‚Äì24 years [ 45]. Based on data from the most
recent census (2009), adolescents aged 14‚Äì19 years comprised about a quarter of the Bissau population.
The country is characterised by ethnic and cultural diversity. About 45% of the population adheres to
Islam (mostly Fula, Mandinga and Beafada) [ 44]. Other ethnic groups (Balanta, Manjaco, Mancanha and
Papel people) are the largest, in addition to smaller groups such as Bijag √≥s, Felupe and Mansoanca)
who adhere to the Christian religion (22%; Catholics and diverse Protestant /Evangelic churches) and
various local religious practices. The o cial language, Portuguese, is spoken by 11‚Äì14%, most of whom
belong to the educated elite in the capital [ 46]. Kriol, a Portuguese-based Creole language, de facto
lingua franca, is spoken as a Ô¨Årst language by about 15% [ 46], and today it is estimated that about 90%
of the population speak Kriol [ 47]. Although only a small proportion of children speaks Portuguese,
it is the language of teaching at all levels of education [ 48]. Irrespective of school form, either public or
private, the curriculum is the same in line with guidelines from the Ministry of Education.
Almost four out of ten primary school-age children, irrespective of gender, are out-of-school [ 49],
and fewer than one-third of children start school at the correct age [ 50]. Only 14% of children who
enrol in grade 1 complete grade 12 in secondary schools [ 51]. Based on information from the Ministry
of Education and Higher Education for the academic year 2014‚Äì2015 (most recent available), in total
there were 31,387 students registered in the 7th to 10th grade in public and private schools in Bissau,
of whom 51.6% were boys [52].
1.4. Aims of the Study
In the context of schools in a low-income country, here Guinea-Bissau, the aims are to describe,
explore and analyse socioeconomic determinants for adolescents ¬¥access to and usage of digital
technology, and its implications. We hypothesise that in this privileged group of adolescents‚Äô,
access will be uneven, shaped by socioeconomic conditions, while the impact of its use is shared with
adolescents elsewhere.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Implementation of the Survey
The data collection followed a distinct and well-established methodology of the Youth in Europe
collaboration, called Planet Youth since 2015, and led by the Icelandic Centre for Social Research and
Analysis (ICSRA) [ 53‚Äì56]. All the survey questions had earlier been developed by an interdisciplinary
team of professionals and used for more than a decade by the collaborating partners to conduct surveys
among adolescents aged 14‚Äì16 years across Europe and elsewhere. Encouraged by this experience,
the survey questions were translated into Portuguese, pilot-tested and adapted to the context in
Guinea-Bissau, e.g., in terms of the language used, and shortened to facilitate completion within the
assigned 90 min (two classroom sessions). The Ô¨Ånal questionnaire included 312 questions divided into
77 main themes, including the use of digital technology. Questions on their socioeconomic background
were no. 1‚Äì20 and 38, on digital media no. 29 and 30, mental health no. 45, smoking no. 55, and alcohol
no. 61. Although the study was the Ô¨Årst of its kind in the setting, after the initial introduction at the
beginning of the class, the students rapidly fell into a rhythm and delivered Ô¨Ålled-in questionnaires
within 60‚Äì90 min. When it was enquired in class how it was going, the students said it was easyInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 8937 4 of 21
for them to answer the questions and expressed satisfaction to have been given the opportunity
to participate.
The target age-group for the study was adolescents aged 15‚Äì16 years, randomly selected by a
methodology applied within the Youth in Europe network [ 54]. Firstly, two of the authors (GG, ZJ)
identiÔ¨Åed 17 educational institutions that o ered education for this age-group in the capital Bissau.
Contact was made with the headmasters who were invited with two teachers for a preparatory meeting
to explain and discuss the study and its background. In March 2017, GG and ZJ visited the 17 schools
to present and discuss once again the study on-site with school headmasters and teachers. Class lists
were not accessible in a computerised form except in a few cases, therefore the authors compiled
an Excel Ô¨Åle with the support of collaborators with information on all classes in the 17 schools that
included at least one-third of students within the target age-group. In total, the Ô¨Åle included 116 classes
with 4470 students enrolled in grades 7‚Äì10, or about 20% of the approximately 24000 students who
were projected to have been enrolled at the time. Thereafter, a random number was electronically
assigned to each class in the Excel Ô¨Åle on which their selection for participation was based [54].
The study was implemented in June 2017; after randomisation of classes, one private school chose
not to participate due to ongoing Ô¨Ånal examinations. In total, 12 public schools and four private
ones participated in the study, two thereof had links to Catholicism, one to Islam, and one without a
religious a liation. In total, 2110 randomly selected students took part in the survey, or 47.2% of the
4470 students who were included in the specially compiled class list.
All completed questionnaires were sent to Iceland for electronic data entry scanning by ICSRA at
Reykjav √≠k University. In total, 2039 questionnaires were successfully digitised and made up the total
number of adolescents who participated in the survey. Unsuccessful scanning was, for example, due to
Ô¨Åne-grained, red dust on the questionnaires from the Ô¨Åeld setting. For each question asked, there was a
minority of students who did not answer and were excluded in the analysis for that particular question;
no question had an answer from all the 2039 students, except school name.
2.2. Statistics
After digitisation, data were imported into the IBM SPSS Statistics 21.0 (Armonk, New York, NY , USA)
by ICSRA sta and codiÔ¨Åed with numerical values. The data Ô¨Åles were then imported into JMP 14.3
(¬©2020 SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA) for data analysis; ‚Äúdon ¬¥t know /doesn‚Äôt apply‚Äù answer,
and missing values were excluded from the analysis. Firstly, we conducted descriptive statistics
on all study variables. Thereafter, each of the variables was recoded to a nominal variable with
a value of either 1 or 0 for bivariate analysis to identify signiÔ¨Åcant explanatory variables for each
dependent variable. The likelihood ratio Chi-square test was used ( p<0.05) and odds ratios (OR)
calculated with 95% conÔ¨Ådence intervals (CI) was used to evaluate statistical signiÔ¨Åcance. For each
of the dependent variables, potential explanatory variables were then introduced into a multivariate
nominal logistic regression model. Non-signiÔ¨Åcant variables were gradually removed from the model,
and an R-squared value ( R2) was calculated for the Ô¨Ånal model.
2.3. Ethics
The study was approved on 6 June 2017, by the Minister of Education in Guinea-Bissau (No /Ref
250/MEES /GM/2017), in line with national requirements. Furthermore, school headmasters approved
the implementation in their respective schools, as did the teachers. Most of the participants were aged
14‚Äì17 years; thus, they were children as deÔ¨Åned by the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) [ 57].
In line with the CRC, children have the right to express their opinion on their situation and participate
as found appropriate for their age. In the setting, demand for prior parental consent might result
in biased data and low response rate [ 58,59]. Furthermore, scholars have called for socio-culturally
responsive ethics reviews [60,61]. Consequently, prior parental consent was not requested.
Before the implementation of the survey in the classroom, students were informed that their
participation was voluntary, the survey questions were not an examination, and they were allowed toInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 8937 5 of 21
skip answers to any or all of the questions. To ensure anonymity, no student revealed his /her identity
on the questionnaire, and upon completion, each student put his /her questionnaire in an envelope and
sealed it before handing it over to the teacher or the authors (GG /ZJ, HB, JE).
3. Results
Table 1 details the demographic background of the respondents (Table S1 with survey questions).
There was a roughly even gender split, with slightly more female participants (52%) than male.
The majority of participants were aged 15‚Äì17 years and had a mother tongue that was not Portuguese.

In the questionnaire, there were 10 questions regarding the usage of digital technology. On average,
1498 (median 1464, range 1293‚Äì1705) out of 2039 (74%) participants reported on each of the ten questions
on digital experience. Across the 10 questions, on average, 45% (median 46, range 21‚Äì69) of the
respondents reported that they had never used the cited technology.
3.1. Access to Digital Technology
Table 2 shows the split between the usage of laptops, mobile phones with internet and desktop
computers, by gender (Table S2, by public and private school). Respondents had the most experience
in using mobile technology with an internet connection (79%), while the use of a desktop computerInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 8937 6 of 21
(31%) was the least frequent experience. About 10% reported that they had no experience of using any
of the cited digital technologies.

3.2. Usage of Desktop Computer and /or Laptop
Fifty-nine percent of the participants reported that they had never used a laptop, and 69% had
never used a desktop computer. In total, 75% of the participants responded to one or both questions
regarding their use of a laptop or desktop computer; 51% had access to at least desktop computer or a
laptop, thereof 28% had access to both technologies (Table 2 and Table S2). Results of the bivariate
analysis are shown in Table 3 for nine socioeconomic explanatory variables for the use of laptops
and/or desktop computers.
The nine socioeconomic variables, as spelt out in Table 3, were subsequently introduced into a
multivariate nominal logistic regression model to identify explanatory variables for the dependent
variable ‚Äòuse of computer and /or laptop‚Äô, with non-signiÔ¨Åcant variables at 0.05 signiÔ¨Åcance level
gradually removed ( R2=0.0769, p<0.0001). The most signiÔ¨Åcant variables for adolescents ¬¥access
to a desktop and /or a laptop were coming from a family that could a ord a car (OR 1.95, 95% CI
1.51‚Äì2.53; p<0.0001), attending a private school (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.44‚Äì2.49; p<0.0001), coming from a
two-headed family (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.36‚Äì2.27; p<0.0001) and having at least one parent who had
started or completed university education or technical training (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.10‚Äì1.94; p=0.0087).
3.3. Usage of Mobile Phone with Internet Capability
Use of mobile phones with an internet connection was reported by 79% of the participants (Table 2
and Table S2). Statistically signiÔ¨Åcant explanatory variables in the bivariate analysis for access to this
technology were gender (boy), attending private school, having at least one parent who had started or
completed university education or technical training, reporting that Portuguese was spoken in the
home, and belonging to a family that could a ord to buy a car (Table 3). In a multivariate nominalInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 8937 7 of 21
logistic regression model introducing the nine explanatory variables in Table 3, the Ô¨Ånal statistically
signiÔ¨Åcant model ( R2=0.0294, p<0.0001) for the usage of a mobile phone with internet capabilities
included gender (boy) (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.31‚Äì2.21; p<0.0001), attending a private school (OR 1.83,
95% CI 1.39‚Äì2.42; p<0.0001), and coming from a family that could a ord a car (OR 1.34, 95% CI
1.02‚Äì1.75; p=0.0348).

46 (2%) did not respond to any of the questions on the use of digital communication across the seven
dierent forms of usage. Of those who responded at least once, 33% did not report any experience at all
in one or more of the tools of digital technology (Table 4), that is 35% of the boys and 31% of the girls.
Usage of digital media in the last 12 months was grouped into three di erent categories: for studies;
any use of social media; and entertainment, games and following the news (Table 5).
The most statistically signiÔ¨Åcant explanatory variables in the bivariate analysis for any usage of
the internet for studies in the last 12 months were gender (boys), living in a two-headed household,Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 8937 8 of 21
and coming from a family that could a ord a car. In a multivariate nominal logistic regression model,
introducing the explanatory variables in Table 5, the Ô¨Ånal statistically signiÔ¨Åcant model for using
the internet for studies ( R2=0.0106, p<0.0001) included gender (boy) (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.19‚Äì1.82;
p=0.0003), and coming from a family that could not a ord a car (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.10‚Äì1.68; p=0.0039).
For the use of social media in the last 12 months, the most signiÔ¨Åcant explanatory variables were
gender (boy), being born in Bissau, attendance of a private school, coming from a family with one
working caretaker, living in a home where Portuguese was spoken, and whose family could a ord
a car (Table 5). In a multivariate nominal logistic regression introducing the explanatory variables
in Table 5, the Ô¨Ånal statistically signiÔ¨Åcant model for the use of social media ( p<0.0001, R2=0.0376)
included attending private school (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.31‚Äì2.24; p=0.0013), gender (boy, OR 1.50, 95%
CI 1.17‚Äì1.93; p=0.0013), coming from a family that could a ord a car (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.15‚Äì1.93;
p=0.0023), and being born in Bissau (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.03‚Äì1.76; p=0.0272).
Use of digital media for entertainment, playing games and /or following the news in the last
12 months was statistically signiÔ¨Åcant for gender (boy), being born in Bissau, attendance of private
school, education of parents (university studies or technical training), and belonging to a family where
Portuguese was spoken at home and that could a ord to buy a car. In a multivariate nominal logistic
regression, introducing the explanatory variables in Table 5, the Ô¨Ånal statistically signiÔ¨Åcant model
for the use of digital media for entertainment, playing games and /or following the news ( p<0.0001,
R2=0.0499) included gender (boy) (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.98‚Äì3.24; p<0.0001), attending a private school
(OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.40‚Äì2.30; p<0.0001), and being born in Bissau (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.10‚Äì1.85; p=0.0060).
When the usage of digital media for studies, social media and /or entertainment, games and
following the news was combined, multivariate nominal logistic regression identiÔ¨Åed four highly
signiÔ¨Åcant explanatory variables for digital media usage among adolescents in Bissau ( R2=0.0409,
p<0.0001), which were gender (boy, OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.64‚Äì2.88; p<0.0001), attending a private school
(OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.17‚Äì2.88; p=0.0027), being born in Bissau (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.09‚Äì1.94; p=0.0107),
and coming from a family that could a ord to buy a car (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.00‚Äì1.77; p=0.0478).
3.5. Impact of Experience of Social Media
Five distinct survey questions were selected to analyse the potential association of experience of
usage of social media and health and wellbeing of Bissau-Guinean adolescents, which were on bullying
behaviour, depression, anxiety, smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol, in addition to language
proÔ¨Åciency. In the analysis, the experience of communicating in the last 12 months on digital media
with friends, family, and people the respondents would like to know was included in addition to other
explanatory variables (Table 5).
Bullying. In the survey, the following question was asked: How often (i.e., never, once, twice,
3‚Äì4 times, and Ô¨Åve times or more) during the last 12 months, have you been part of a group that teased
another? In total, 11% out of 1454 participants reported experience of social media and had been part
of such a group. Those who had experienced the use of social media were 2.51 times (95% CI 1.59‚Äì3.97)
more likely to report participation in bullying behaviour compared to those with no experience of
social media. They were also more likely to attend a private school (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.02‚Äì1.90;
p=0.0348) and come from a family where at least one parent had university or technical training
(OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.21‚Äì2.50; p=0.0020). There were no gender di erences in the experience of bullying
(p=0.6730). In a multivariate nominal logistic regression model ( R2=0.0244, p<0.0001), the experience
of social media was the most important explanatory variable for bullying (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.49‚Äì3.90;
p=0.0003), in addition to having at least one parent who had university or technical training (OR 1.60,
95% CI 1.09‚Äì2.34; p=0.0156).Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 8937 9 of 21

Depression . In the survey, the following question was asked: How often (i.e., almost never, seldom,
sometimes, and often) have you felt sad or blue in the past week? In total, 8% of 1440 participants
reported having ‚Äúoften‚Äù felt sad or blue in the past week. Those who had the experience of social media
were 1.62 times more likely (95% CI 1.01‚Äì2.63) to have often felt sad or blue in the past week compared
to those who had no such experience. In a multivariate nominal logistic regression model, two variables
were statistically signiÔ¨Åcant for symptoms of depression ( R2=0.0145, p=0.0037). Girls were 1.73 times
more likely (95% CI 1.16‚Äì2.58; p=0.0074) compared to boys to have felt depressed in the past week
and those with experience of social media were 1.69 times more likely (95% CI 1.04‚Äì2.74; p=0.0353) to
have felt depressed compared to those with no experience.
Anxiety . In the survey, the following question was asked: How often (i.e., almost never, seldom,
sometimes, and often) have you felt tense the past week? In total, 8% out of 1409 participants reported
having ‚Äúoften‚Äù felt tense the past week. Those who had an experience of social media were 1.80 times
more likely (95% CI 1.10‚Äì2.93) to report to have often felt tense in the past week compared to those
who had no experience, and multivariate nominal logistic regression analysis did not identify other
explanatory variables.
Smoking . In the survey, the following question was asked: How often have you smoked cigarettes
in your lifetime? In total, 15% out of 1566 participants reported having smoked cigarette at least once in
their lifetime. Those with experience of social media were 2.52 times more likely (95% CI 1.72‚Äì3.69) to
have experienced smoking cigarettes at least once compared to those who had no experience of smoking.Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 8937 11 of 21
In a multivariate nominal logistic regression model, three explanatory variables were statistically
signiÔ¨Åcant for lifetime experience of smoking cigarettes ( R2=0.0767, p<0.0001). Most signiÔ¨Åcant was
attending a private school; those attending private school were 3.21 more likely (95% CI 2.35‚Äì4.38;
p<0.0001) to have smoked compared to those attending a public school. Boys were also more likely to
have smoked cigarettes compared to girls (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.56‚Äì2.82; p<0.0001). Finally, those with
experience of social media were 1.91 times more likely (95% CI 1.29‚Äì2.83; p=0.0013) to have smoked
cigarettes compared to those who did not have that experience.
Alcohol. In the survey, the following question was asked: How often have you had a drink of
alcohol of any kind in your lifetime? In total, 31% out of 1559 participants had the experience of
drinking alcohol at least once in their lifetime. Participants with experience of social media were
1.47 times more likely (95% CI 1.15‚Äì1.90) to have drunk alcohol compared to those who reported no use
of alcohol. In a multivariate nominal logistic regression model, four signiÔ¨Åcant explanatory variables
were identiÔ¨Åed for lifetime experience of drinking alcohol ( R2=0.0405, p<0.0001). These explanatory
variables were attending a private school (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.19‚Äì2.06; p=0.0015), having at least one
parent who had initiated or completed university or technical training (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.17‚Äì2.12;
p=0.0026), not coming from a two-headed household (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.18‚Äì1.96), and being born
in Bissau (OR 1.48, 95 CI 1.10‚Äì2.00; p=0.0102). There was a tendency for experience of social media
to be associated with a lifetime experience of drinking alcohol, but it was not statistically signiÔ¨Åcant
(OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.96‚Äì1.73; p=0.0900).
Language proÔ¨Åciency . Participants reported on their grade in Portuguese and English or French.
There was no statistical association with good grades and the use of social media (OR 0.92,
95% CI 0.58‚Äì1.47; p=0.7298).
4. Discussion
Here, we report results of a survey on the access to and use of digital technology among adolescents
attending schools in the capital of Guinea-Bissau, Bissau. The key Ô¨Åndings were that access to digital
technologies was limited, even in this relatively privileged context. Mobile phones with internet
capability were more commonly accessed, with about four out of Ô¨Åve having experience of one,
compared to the use of a laptop and /or desktop computer by fewer than half of the participants.
The most signiÔ¨Åcant explanatory variables of having access to these devices were attendance of a
private school, coming from two-headed households and having educated parents‚Äîfactors likely to
be associated with increased wealth. Regarding usages of digital technology, a third of the survey
participants reported they had not used the internet for any of the tools included in the survey, while the
most commonly used tool was social media to connect with friends (two out of three sometimes doing
this). The internet being used for study was applicable to just over half, with boys from wealthy
families being most likely to do this. Boys were also most likely to have experience of any use of social
media and to use the internet for games /entertainment /news. E ects of social media usage included
being more likely to have participated in bullying behaviour, express increased feelings of anxiety
and depression, and an increased likelihood to have tried smoking cigarettes, in line with results in
other settings.
4.1. Access and Usage
The principal aim of the study was to explore digital technology access and usage of
school-attending adolescents living in the capital city of Guinea-Bissau. Access to the primary three
devices (desktop and /or laptop, and mobile phone with internet) was generally low (Table 2 and
Table S2). Fifty-nine per cent of the respondents had never used a laptop in the last year, and 69% of
them had never used a desktop computer. These results are in-line with data from other SSA countries;
data from 2018 indicate that although access was improving, less than one out of ten households in SSA
had access to a household computer [ 62]. The results reÔ¨Çect the pervasive poverty in the region that
makes ownership of one only a distant dream for most families. Besides, the population of adolescentsInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 8937 12 of 21
taken for our sample is likely to have given a more generous view of the situation, given that all the
survey respondents were attending schools in the capital city, a privileged social setting. If samples
were taken from adolescents generally, around the country, including rural areas and including those
not enrolled in school, a di erent, bleaker picture would have almost certainly been painted.
In our survey, 79% of respondents reported using a mobile phone with internet capability in the
last 12 months, a much higher proportion compared to laptop /desktop usage (Table 2 and Table S2).
This is in line with other research in the Ô¨Åeld, with one study showing that most millennials in South
Africa accessed the internet through a combination of mobiles and personal computers (88%) compared
to 12% who only used a computer to access the internet [ 33]; mobile phones are cheap, easy to use
and widely accessible in the market in contrast to expensive desktops or laptops, in addition to their
dependence on stable access to electricity. Elsewhere on the continent, 74% of Zambians had mobile
phones, but only 7% had internet access in the homes, with ownership levels for boys aged 15‚Äì19 years
being higher (42%) than girls of the same age (32%) [ 32]. In Mozambique, another former Portuguese
colony in SSA, a similar proportion (80% of urban households) were found to have mobile phone
access [ 63], and in Liberia, 81% of urban households had mobile phone access, compared to only 10%
having computer access in the house [ 64]. One potential reason for the more widespread usage of
mobile phones compared to desktops and laptops is that mobiles are not considered the individual
devices they are perceived to be in Europe, or the USA Phone sharing is a common concept in SSA,
which inÔ¨Çates the proportion of populations that have mobile phone access, compared to computers,
which are less portable and harder to share [ 17]. This is backed up by a 2018 study in South Africa
which claimed that 76% of respondents who did not own a mobile phone had access to one through
sharing [ 19]. Another study stated that 17% of students in South Africa said they shared a phone,
which explained why despite 23% of respondents not owning a handset, 96% still claimed to use one
on a typical day [ 28]. The proportion of phone sharing among adolescents in Guinea-Bissau is not
known and needs further research.
Overall, internet access has been rapidly increasing with more than half of the global population
estimated to have had access in 2018 [ 62]. The data expose, however, a global digital divide; in 2016,
three out of four people had internet access in high-income countries, compared to less than one out of
Ô¨Åve in those least developed [ 9]. In SSA, South Africa was the most connected country with 54% of the
population having internet access, compared to 4% for Guinea-Bissau [ 9]; more recent data indicate a
gradual increase to 7.5% of the total Bissau-Guinean population [ 65]. Our data, from an albeit more
privileged group, showed a more positive representation, with around two-thirds of students surveyed
reporting some usage of the internet for one of seven listed activities (Table 4 and Table S3).
Globally, around 40% of youth are said to use the internet to learn about things for school or
health-related information, while only 9% of global youth said they used it to read about politics and
improving the community [ 9]. Comparatively, our study showed that 55% of those who answered
claimed some internet usage for study and 64% sometimes used the internet to read the news over the
last 12 months. These were some of the higher categories for usage, with only social media usage to
contact friends and family being more frequent (62% and 67%, respectively). These levels are in line
with data from Tanzania, which showed that 65% of respondents used the internet to communicate
with friends, while only 22% used it to read the news [ 66]. Furthermore, 15% of Tanzanian respondents
reported internet usage to watch videos, and only 10% to play games. This is signiÔ¨Åcantly lower
than we found in our data from Guinea-Bissau, which showed that 51% had used the internet for
entertainment in the last 12 months and 41% had used the internet to play games (predominantly a
male behaviour). Reasons for this may be the privileged status of the study group, as well as the
dierence in wording to the questions. In our study, the adolescents were asked if they had ever used
it within the last 12 months, while in Tanzania, it was more generally worded.
Research has indicated that when Africans go online, they predominantly spend time on social
media platforms, with other activities becoming less important [ 12]. This raises questions over whether
the internet is more of a useful tool for education or simply a distraction. For example, some claimInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 8937 13 of 21
that the increasing use of phones by students causes more disruption in the classroom than good,
with increases in late-night calls, bullying and harassment [ 23]. Our data do not indicate better grades
in languages (Portuguese and English /French) for those with access to digital technology compared
with those without access. This lack of association might indicate deÔ¨Åcient knowledge on how to
properly use the technology to improve individual skills, compounded further by lack of support
and guidance from teachers who themselves often lack access and skills to positively beneÔ¨Åt from it.
This situation is further aggravated in the current COVID-19 pandemic, as estimates indicate that only
6% of pre-primary to upper secondary students in SSA can potentially be reached through the internet
by remote learning policies [67].
4.2. Determinants of Usage and Barriers
Prevailing economic gaps have been identiÔ¨Åed as hindering access to digital technology [ 9].
Globally, SSA is the poorest region in the world; in 2013, about two-thirds of the region lived
in multidimensional poverty, judged by monetary welfare measures (income and expenditure) and
indicators on access to education and infrastructure [ 68]. In such a setting, the cost of digital technologies
is an important barrier to usage. Across Africa, consumers of mobile data pay the highest cost relative
to monthly income [ 69]. In terms of cost for a low-consumption mobile-data-and-voice basket (70 voice
minutes, 20 SMS text messages, and 500 Mb broadband), in 2018 the costs in Guinea-Bissau were
among the highest in the world; it ranked 175 out of 182 countries with costs equivalent to 26.3% of GNI
(Gross National Income) per capita or USD 16.5 (USD 37.8 purchasing power parity) [ 70]. To determine
whether wealth was a factor for Bissau-Guinean adolescents using mobile phones, we used two proxy
indicators for a perceived actual wealth of their parents. Those who reported that their family could
seldom or almost never a ord a car or attended public school were signiÔ¨Åcantly less likely than those
from families who could a ord to buy a car or attended a private school to use digital media for studies,
social media, or entertainment (Table 5). In a multivariate nominal logistic regression model, the only
statistically signiÔ¨Åcant factor for parental wealth and use of these digital technologies was attending a
private school compared to a public one. Similarly, adolescents attending private schools or whose
parents could a ord to buy a car were signiÔ¨Åcantly more likely to have used a laptop and /or desktop
computer (Table 3), which was also statistically signiÔ¨Åcant in a multivariate model. Thus, the results
manifest one important aspect of existing inequalities in this young population group.
Access to digital technology is not only shaped by wealth but also by gender. Overall, research
has shown that men are more likely to adopt new technologies than women. In 2016, 28% of men in
SSA had access to the internet compared to 22% females [ 14]. However, a few studies have pointed at
rising equality, namely in South Africa, where there are equal numbers of male and female Facebook
users [ 19]; in terms of phone ownership, female users reached parity in 2013 /2014 with around half
of both boys and girls between the ages of 9‚Äì18 owning mobile phones [ 23]. Data from eight SSA
countries from the period 2017‚Äì2019 indicated that adolescent girls (aged 15‚Äì18 years) lagged behind
boys in all the countries in information and communication technology (ICT) skills [ 71]. For example,
in Ghana, 7% of the girls possessed such skills compared to 16% of boys, a divide that has to be taken
into account when implementing remote learning policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our data
show that, generally, there is little gender disparity among our sample group, although again, this may
be due to the privileged population in focus. Of the students surveyed, approximately half of both
boys and girls (53% and 49%, respectively) had an experience of having used either a desktop computer
or a laptop (Tables 2 and 3). There were slightly more boys (85%) who had ever used a mobile phone
with an internet connection, compared to girls (75%), and the di erence was statistically signiÔ¨Åcant.
SpeciÔ¨Åcally looking at which gender is more likely to use the internet for help with their studies,
boys (60%) were significantly more likely than girls to report doing so (Tables 4 and 5). Similarly , boys were
signiÔ¨Åcantly more likely than girls to use social media, and the internet for entertainment, to play
games, or to follow the news (Table 5).Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 8937 14 of 21
In many SSA countries, usage of the technology brings out other gendered blocks than simple
access. For example, in Tanzania, it was found that girls were scared of disclosing their interest in
the internet to guardians and teachers [ 66]. This was due to usage by adolescent girls being less
socially accepted than boys because of concerns over negative inÔ¨Çuences and cultural restrictions
on the behaviour of girls, compared to boys. Indeed, 71% of internet users in Tanzania were male.
In Malawi, only 1‚Äì2% of girls under the age of 19 in rural areas owned phones compared to 5% of
boys, who were allowed to carry them freely [ 23]. Girls being seen carrying phones in public could see
themselves being labelled as prostitutes because of social discourse. Similar themes were also found in
Ghana, even in rural areas, over fears of phone ownership leading to teenage pregnancy. Although our
data from Guinea-Bissau suggests that the levels of gender discrimination are not so high, the gap may
be more pronounced in a di erent sample population, and with more speciÔ¨Åc questions being asked
over digital media usage.
It has been alluded to in one study that education of the user and in particular, English language
proÔ¨Åciency (in South Africa) was a key determinant of whether the respondent used the internet [ 16].
The logic behind this is that most of the content on the internet is in the major world languages, and thus
if you do not speak these languages, you would be excluded from a lot of internet uses. In South Africa,
about 20% of respondents said they could not easily read or write in English, and of those, only 3%
used the internet. In our survey in Guinea-Bissau, rather than English proÔ¨Åciency, we compared
this metric using Portuguese. Portuguese is the 9th most spoken language in the world [ 72], and we
would hypothesise that having Portuguese spoken in the home (assuming that to equate to Ô¨Çuency in
the language) should positively inÔ¨Çuence internet usage (Table 4). In our data, those who reported
Portuguese being spoken at home were signiÔ¨Åcantly more likely to use social media and the internet
for entertainment, games and /or following the news (Table 5). The observed impact disappeared,
however, in the multivariate model, thus explained by other factors than just language proÔ¨Åciency.
Education has been identiÔ¨Åed as a major determinant of internet usage in the USA, with those
with higher education more likely to adopt the technology compared to those with less education [ 73].
In Zambia, internet usage among women and men generally increased with better education, with 79%
of women and 89% of men with higher education using the internet in the last 12 months compared to
just 1% of women and 6% of men without higher education [ 32]. Our sample included school-attending
adolescents; therefore, we can instead look at whether education of their parents a ects internet usage.
Adolescents who reported usage of the internet were overall more likely to have at least one parent
who had started or completed university or technical training compared with those whose parents had
less education (Table 5). However, such an impact disappeared in the multivariate nominal logistic
regression model.
One determinant of internet usage in SSA is whether you live in an urban area or a rural area.
Rural African regions are characterised by low employment, a weak subsistence economy and poor
technical infrastructure, negatively impacting ICT adoption [ 19]. In Zambia, 14% of urban populations
had internet access compared to 2% of rural populations [ 32], while 82% of urban Mozambique
populations had mobile phone access compared to 54% of rural households [ 63]. Our sample was taken
from an urban area, making this di cult to measure using our data. As a proxy, we can, however, use
data from where the students were born‚Äîsplit into two categories of inside the capital Bissau (68%) or
outside (32%). Although this is not a perfect metric, because those born elsewhere could still be from
other urban areas in the country, it may indicate wealth /habit of families using technology. Those who
were born in Bissau were signiÔ¨Åcantly more likely to report the use of a desktop computer and /or
laptop compared to those born elsewhere (Table 3), and also in using social media and the internet for
entertainment, games and /or following the news (Table 5). This impact, however, disappeared in our
multivariate nominal logistic regression model.Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 8937 15 of 21
4.3. Consequences of Technology Usage
The evidence for the inÔ¨Çuence of marketing through traditional media on adolescents‚Äô use of
tobacco is well documented [ 3,74]. In contrast, the impact of advertising on the consumption of alcohol
has been found to be minimal in South Africa [ 75]. With internet access comes greater exposure to
advertising, through online advertisements by social media inÔ¨Çuencers, on video platforms such as
Facebook, YouTube and Instagram, and at the sides of most web pages. Another way the internet
can inÔ¨Çuence tobacco or alcohol consumption is through peer pressure, in that those who are friends
with other people who drink and smoke and see them doing so through social media channels, for
example, may be more inÔ¨Çuenced to do so themselves [ 76]. Using our data, we asked the question:
Does social media usage to connect with friends, and other interactions on the internet, impact usage
of alcohol or smoking cigarettes? The criteria for social media usage for this analysis included those
who answered that they had used any social media at least sometimes in the last 12 months; the criteria
for alcohol, or smoking cigarettes were lifetime experience in use. Adolescents who reported lifetime
experience of either smoking cigarettes or consuming alcohol were signiÔ¨Åcantly more likely to have
used social media compared to those who did not have that experience; this association held up in a
multivariate nominal logistic regression model for smoking cigarettes but not for lifetime experience of
drinking alcohol. However, our bivariate results indicate support to another study that suggested
that the rise of social media usage sees more young people exposed to and displaying pro-alcohol
messages [ 77]. Social media sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, have conducive formats for sharing
pictures with a culture of anonymity and privacy, and posted content is likely to be seen not only by
peers but by younger users, who are more impressionable. Moreno and Whitehill [ 77] cited several
studies that referred to alcohol-related displays on social media, including photographs depicting or
alluding to alcohol consumption and links to alcohol-related groups or companies. Although this
may remain relevant for smoking, as well as for alcohol abuse, what seems to have more of an impact
are movie portrayals of smoking, as well as peer and parent smoking [ 78]. Social media usage is
obviously linked with internet access, and with that comes more exposure to both peer activities and
also media (music videos and movies). Fifty-one percent of survey participants in Guinea-Bissau had
an experience of using the internet for entertainment, which includes these activities (Table 4).
In addition to alcohol and smoking, some sources claim that digital technology adoption intensiÔ¨Åes
cases of bullying in children, which is known to a ect wellbeing [ 9]. Adolescents in Bissau who had
experience of using social media were more than twice as likely to have participated in a group that
teased others. Social media and other online platforms provide easier access to others, and over time
bullying can become normalised and even rewarded with increased social status [ 79]. Furthermore,
the veil of anonymity that the internet and social media can provide can also lead to more bullying,
because the lack of face-to-face encounters prevents many of the negative consequences of bullying
from occurring. Another study from South Africa showed that one in three children had experienced
cyberbullying and that 47% of those had been bullied through a mobile phone, showing that the
devices are being used as a tool to increase bullying frequency [ 10]. In our data, social media usage was
statistically the most important factor linked to bullying, with other strong explanatory factors being
attending a private school and having educated parents. These two factors, as well as having internet
access, are associated with wealth, therefore there is a case for saying that it is the relative wealth
of the adolescents, strengthened by the actual usage of social media, which is causing the increased
participation in bullying behaviour.
Bullying is most common in the west and central African regions, with Ô¨Åve of the top ten countries
for bullying rates (65‚Äì81%) being situated in Africa [ 80]. Girls reported more indirect bullying ,
while boys experienced direct bullying. Our data from Bissau showed little gender di erences.
Boys were marginally more likely to have participated in bullying behaviour than girls, although we
lack data on the gender of the victims and the exact nature of the bullying, themes that merit further
research. Overall, only 10% of boys and 11% of girls had participated in the teasing of another
individual. These bullying rates are relatively low compared to the rest of Africa, which could be dueInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 8937 16 of 21
to the fact that the line of the questioning came from an accusatory angle, rather than an experience
angle‚Äîi.e., if the question had been phrased ‚ÄúHow often have you been teased by another group?‚Äù,
the percentages might be higher.
In terms of mental health, increased usage of digital technologies, in particular, the usage of social
media, has been said to also increase anxiety and low self-esteem [ 81,82]. According to one study,
one potential hazard of social media is a growing preoccupation with body image, through exposure
to media output on glamorous celebrities and comparison with friends on social media [ 7]. It has
also been reported that excessive use of digital technology can contribute to childhood depression
and anxiety, due to the immersion in screens creating an internet dependency [ 9]. Although 8% of the
participants in Guinea-Bissau had said they often felt tense in the past week, they were almost twice as
likely to report tension if they had experience of using social media‚Äîinterestingly, the only statistically
signiÔ¨Åcant explanatory variable. This conclusion supports the data from UNICEF and shows that social
media might impact negatively on mental wellbeing [ 9]. Similarly, with depression, adolescents in our
survey who used social media were signiÔ¨Åcantly more likely to have felt sad or blue in the last week,
compared to those that had not. This result again is supported by other literature [ 83]. Facebook and
Instagram usage has been directly and indirectly correlated with symptoms of depression, although the
seriousness of symptoms increases with age [ 84]. These Ô¨Åndings beg the question: are adolescents
in SSA at a higher risk of su ering from mental health conditions due to newly increased usage of
these tools?
Our results highlight the need for increased awareness among Bissau-Guinean adolescents on the
potentially negative consequences of the usage of digital media. Not all are familiar with the technology,
a fact that is likely to apply as well to parents and teachers alike. For preventive measures, the most
eective platforms include TV or radio programmes, for example, supported with data from the
survey. Parents also need to be made aware of the potential negative consequences of the usage of the
technology in the daily lives of their children [ 85], and by practising kind parenting styles, they could
also become more e ective in preventing cyberbullying against or by their children [ 86]. Furthermore,
school headmasters and teachers could engage in kind and reasoning discussion with students in
class as a preventive measure against cyberbullying, to improve their health and wellbeing in the
digital age. Interestingly, SSA has been identiÔ¨Åed as the next big market by international operators
of gambling [ 27], an additional threat to Bissau-Guinean adolescents of which parents and teachers
should be made aware of and needs further research in the setting. Finally, concerted actions are also
needed by social media companies, such as Facebook and Instagram, to develop internet policies in
collaborative partnerships that protect children from cyberspace risks [87].
4.4. Strength and Limitations
One strength of the present study builds on its reaching out to school-attending adolescents in
the capital Bissau, randomly selected for participation from a specially compiled register targeting
adolescents aged 15‚Äì16 years, in both public and private schools. The survey methodology built on
gained experience within the Planet Youth collaboration with similar surveys having been implemented
in 32 countries and 111 communities [ 88]. It is the Ô¨Årst study of its kind in the setting. However, there are
limitations. Ethnicity and religion were not included in the statistical analysis because the application
is complex in the context of multi-ethnic Guinea-Bissau, and results do not render themselves for a
proper interpretation. Another limitation is that the study included only school-attending adolescents,
a privileged urban group in the setting, thus excluding out-of-school adolescents, and those living
outside the capital Bissau.
5. Conclusions
The main conclusion of our study is that even in this privileged group of adolescents in the capital
Bissau, access to digital technology is low in Guinea-Bissau. This provides more evidence to the
existing global digital divide, in addition to the gender gap in the usage of the technology. The evidenceInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020 ,17, 8937 17 of 21
seems to link predominantly negative consequences to the usage of the devices, in particular social
media. Still, these are problems adolescents also face in Europe and other high-income countries and
are an expression of commonality of adolescents‚Äô experiences across di erent world regions. This does
not equate to digital technology being bad. The lesson to be learned is, therefore, about educating the
users of the technology to obtain the biggest beneÔ¨Åts. Adolescents who learn to use the internet to
search for information, help with studies, and gain experience using tools such as word processors will
be better equipped for future studies and employment. An inevitable consequence of increased media
usage is that adolescents will face higher exposure to advertisements, potentially for harmful products
such as alcohol and tobacco, and peers and celebrities engaging in activities we do not wish to see
adolescents‚Äô replicate. However, if used correctly, the beneÔ¨Åts of the internet and the technologies to
increase communication has the potential to create more beneÔ¨Åts than negatives. Since the adoption of
the SDGs in 2015, the needs of adolescents‚Äîthe SDG generation‚Äîhave increasingly been in focus.
Our results indicate that Bissau-Guinean adolescents are at a large risk of being left behind without
improved opportunities to develop their digital skills and proÔ¨Åciency in preparation for a labour
market that increasingly demands such experience and knowledge.
