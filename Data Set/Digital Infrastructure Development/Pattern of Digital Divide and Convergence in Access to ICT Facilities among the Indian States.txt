Abstract
Information and communication technology (ICT) such as Internet, mobile phones, computers and 
related network interfaces facilitate promotion of economic growth by improving the allocation and productivity of labour and capital, and also by promoting trade and competition in market. But these regional developments led by ICT technologies are not realised if there is a digital divide. In India, uneven digital developments may lead to uneven economic developments. Unless ICT developments grow faster in low-income states, they cannot catch up with high-income states, economically. In this context, this article aims to analyse the changing pattern of the digital divide and empirically exam-ines the convergence in access to ICT facilities across the Indian states. The secondary data for 15 major states of India is used for the time period 2008–17 by considering three ICT variables, namely, telephone users, mobile phone users and Internet users per 100 populations. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to construct ICT access index. With PCA scores, the Indian states are ranked at two data points and convergence is verified by using sigma and beta convergence techniques. Findings suggest that there is an uneven access to ICT facilities across the Indian states. In the last decade, the low-income states are growing on a better pace than the high-income states in providing access to facilities such as telephone and mobile phones. However, there is evidence of the divergence in the use of Internet facilities. So the governments’ attention in improving these facilities in the low-income states, particularly in rural areas and lagging districts, is important. Special policies and schemes need to be devised to promote the access of Internet services in the lagging states.

1. Introduction
Information and communication technology (ICT) such as Internet, mobile phones, computers and 
related network interfaces have not only made it convenient for individuals, producers and the govern-ment to carry out their respective works but also have reduced the distance globally. The ICT growth and penetrations are two distinct concepts which are generally confused as synonyms. The ICT growth indi-cates the growth of information technology (IT) related industries and services like telecommunication and other ICT services. The ICT penetration on the other hand is reflected in terms of the access to ICT facilities and the IT-induced development, which increases productivity, competitiveness, economic growth and human welfare from the use of technology by different sectors of economy. The world expe-rienced an exponential growth in Internet users from 1 billion to 3.2 billion in just a decade that is from 2005 to 2015. The way we conduct our lives is changing dramatically, and therefore this era is often termed ‘information age’, brought us by the digital revolution.
Apart from convenience and connectivity, ICT also leads to gains in productivity as it enhances coor -
dination and reduces the cost of transmission of information and computing power. Endogenous growth theories found their motivation from the unexplained residual in Solow model which accounts for the technological coefficient. Romer’s (1990) endogenous growth model, in which technological spill overs are present, the economy-wide capital stock positively affects output at the industry level, so there may be increasing returns to scale at the economy-wide level. The leader–follower model of Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995) also explains that innovation and technology imitation affects the rate of economic growth which results in a conditional convergence of leader’s and follower’s growth pattern. Therefore, ICT may promote an economic growth by improving the allocation and productivity of labour and capi -
tal and also by promoting trade and competition in the market. 
Some economists consider ICT’s catalytic role in bringing the unreserved and marginalised into the 
mainstream and technology’s innate ability to enable participation of the poor and marginalised as the main elements of ‘development’. But this development led by ICT technologies is not realised if there is a digital divide. It is a divide between haves and have-nots of the ICT technologies. McNair (2000) states that
easy access to ICT enables people to become richer and therefore more able to afford still newer technology; 
it is moreover the already educated who disproportionately take up lifelong learning activities and who, in general, get better services. In short, the educated information rich become richer and the less educated infor -
mation poor become poorer.
India has been one of such economies which almost escaped the secondary stage and entered directly 
into the tertiary stage that is the service-led economic growth. As per the figure accounted in 2016, ser -
vice sector contributed the highest percentage to GDP that is 53.66 per cent. The ICT contributes by a large extent to service sector as it uses the skilled labour, promotes e-commerce and creates employment opportunities. Apart from the contribution to GDP, ICT penetration may accelerate growth in the long term. But the ICT penetration varies across states of India, and there is digital divide across the Indian states. The ICT facilities are required for both the high-income and the low-income states. In this con-text, it is important to analyse the changing pattern of the digital divide and empirically examine the convergence in the access to ICT facilities across the Indian states. 
The rest of the article is structured as follows: Section 2 deals with the review of selected literature; 
Section 3 provides data and methodology; Section 4 analyses the findings of the study and, finally, Section 5 concludes the study. Agarwal and Panda 39
2. Review of Literature
This section provides the review of the studies in the area of digital divide among regions and the role of 
ICT in the economic growth of the nations. The studies at the international level by Vu Khuong (2011, 2017), Farhadi et al. (2012), Hofman et al. (2016), Albiman and Sulong (2017), Pick and Nishida (2015), Nishijima, Ivanauskas and Sarti (2017) and Wong (2002) have analysed the digital divide across the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the positive effect of ICT penetration on eco-nomic growth, the impact of ICT use on economic growth, the impact of increased investment in ICT on acceleration of economic growth in Latin America, non-linear and linear impact of ICT on Sub-Saharan African regions, the various factors influencing technological utilisation, the determinants of digital divide in Brazil and reasons behind laagering of Asian countries in ICT adoption, respectively. Vu Khuong (2011, 2017) analysed that world is being outpaced by ASEAN countries in reducing the digital divide and proved that the marginal effect of penetration of Internet usage is larger than mobile phones, which is larger than personal computers, on economic growth. Farhadi et al. (2012) have observed that ICT use index has the strongest effect on real GDP per capita of high-income countries, while this effect is the lowest in countries with low level of income. Hofman, Aravena, and Aliaga (2016) have observed that Latin America has been able to reduce the gap in the per capita GDP, though it is not evenly spread across countries. Albiman and Sulong (2017) show that ICT impact is significant when sufficient ICT transmission is present and penetration reached to masses of Sub-Saharan Africa. Pick and Nishida (2015) have verified the correlation between tertiary education and innovative capacity for worldwide Internet subscribers. Nishijima et al. (2017) show that inequality is decreasing with time on both Internet access and mobile ownership, but on individual levels there is a room for policies for mass access for ICT goods and improving digital literacy especially among elderly. Wong (2002) has examined that for Asian countries, the disparity of competitive index is lower than the ICT adoption intensity as compared to the non-Asian countries.
In the Indian context, very few papers address the issue of digital divide and ICT’s role in the Indian 
economic growth. Kaur and Singh (2016), Kaur and Neena (2014) and a report by DIT-NCAER’s e-Readiness (2010) observed the presence of digital divide in India. Chandrasekhar (2002) and Vijaybhaskar and Gayathri (2003) have discussed the issues related to ICT sector in India with reference to development and observed that the experience of production, diffusion and use of ICTs in India has been intriguing and complex, respectively.
In DIT-NCAER’s e-Readiness (2010) composite index, the e-readiness indicator is considered as the 
ability to pursue and realise value creation opportunities facilitated by ICT. To measure the e-readiness, three main sub-indicators are used: the environment that promotes the spread and usage of ICT, the readiness of different stakeholders of the economy, the government—both the initiatives of central and state—businesses and the individual to assess the use ICT and the degree of usage of ICT by the three stakeholders. Considering the level of e-readiness, states/union territories have been categorised as leaders, aspiring leaders, expectants, average achievers, below average achievers and least achievers. Kaur and Singh (2016) examine an increase in the rural teledensity since 2000, which is from 0.68 per cent to 39.9 per cent in 2012, but the digital divide between the rural and urban areas grew from 7.58 in 2000 to 109.40 in 2012. Chandrasekhar (2002) argues that the IT sectors’ growth is most privately driven, and the government is playing a mere role of facilitator which is making it difficult for the states to connect the disconnected.
The literature reviewed covers the studies both in the international and Indian level. Studies related to 
digital divide mainly conclude that the key variables describing the ICT are mainly mobile phones, 40  Journal of Infrastructure Development 10(1–2)
telephones and Internet. Besides, there are other factors which influence the usage and access of ICT and 
those can be different for developing and developed economies. Also, it is observed that the production of ICT is not enough to measure the ICT penetration; rather access to ICT facilities is important. Studies pertaining to ICT developments in India are sparse, and further very few studies analyse digital divide and convergence among the Indian states and regions. The present study is an attempt to fill up the gap and provide inference on digital divide and its convergence across the Indian states in the last decade.
3. Data and Methodology
The secondary data for 15 major states of India (Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal) are taken from the sources of Annual Statistics of Department of Telecommunication, Statistical Abstracts of India, economic survey, census publication, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, Government of India, Cellular Operator Association of India and various Government of India websites for a decade (from 2007–08 to 2016–17).
Descriptive statistics are used to show the pattern of ICT variables (telephone users per 100 popula-
tion, mobile phone users per 100 population and Internet users per 100 population) across the Indian states between two data points that is average of the initial 3 years of the data set (2007–08, 2008–09 and 2009–10) and average of the last 3 years of the data set (2014–15, 2015–16 and 2016–17).
Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to construct the ICT access index. Scores derived from 
the index are used to rank the Indian states for both data points and verify convergence.
Convergence is checked using sigma and beta convergence. Standard deviations are used to check 
sigma convergence with variables: telephone users per 100 population, mobile phone users per 100 population and Internet users per 100 population for the last decade (from 2007–08 to 2016–17). In order to find beta convergence coefficients, the specific equation used is as follows: 
Ln(Y) = a + bT + e
where b is the trend growth rate, Y is a particular ICT variable and T is the time trend. The trend growth 
rate for each indicator is alternatively regressed on their Initial value to find convergence coefficients.
4. Analysis and Findings
The analysis of the study comprises two parts, observing the changing pattern of the digital divide among the Indian states and the convergence of ICT variables among the Indian states.
4.1 Changing Pattern of Digital Divide among the Indian States in Access to ICT Variables
In this section, the pattern of digital divide is analysed using three ICT variables such as: (a) telephone users, (b) mobile phone users and (c) Internet users. For comparison, numbers of each variable have been rationalised for 100 populations and same are used for analysis. These are the basic variables to assess the access to digital facilities. The triennial average of the initial 3 years (2007–08, 2008–09 and 2009–10) and the last 3 years of the decade (2014–15, 2015–16 and 2016–17) on the observed data set is taken for comparison.Agarwal and Panda 41
These three variables show the penetration of ICT technology among the Indian states in access, and 
the comparison between two periods helps observe the changing pattern of the digital divide among 
states over a decade. Also, the segregation of states between high- and low-income groups gives a clear picture of the changing positions of every state in that group. 
Therefore, an effort is made to give an insight to the state governments so that if they are losing their 
position among other states, they can make policy changes to boost the penetration of ICT.
4.1.1 Pattern of Access to Mobile Phones
In India, mobile phones have become an integral part of everyone’s life. It helps in connecting to peo-
ple, for work, family and leisure. Therefore, it reduces the distance to a minimum, digitally. Table 1 shows the penetration of mobile phones per 100 populations. It is evident from the table that there is a rise in the usage of mobile phones in all the 15 states irrespective of the group they belong to over the study period.

The number of people using mobile phones in high-income group (HIG) states such as Andhra 
Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and West 
Bengal is around 26, 32, 27, 32, 38, 31, 41, 25, 46 and 24 per 100 populations, respectively, on an average for the first triennial average that is for the period 2007–09, which increased to approximately 65, 83, 57, 67, 66, 77, 77, 63, 87 and 64 per 100 populations, respectively, on an average in the last 3 years that is in the years, 2014–15, 2015–16 and 2016–17. 
The number of people using mobile phones in Assam, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh 
is approximately 20, 19, 22, 19 and 18 per 100 populations, respectively, on an average in the years, 2007–08, 2008–09 and 2009–10, which increased to approximately 49, 60, 57, 49 and 53 per 100 popula-tions, respectively, on an average in the years, 2014–15, 2015–16 and 2016–17 in low-income group (LIG).
The standard deviation (SD) shows the spread of the data that is the distance from the mean. For the 
initial 3 years’ average of data set, the SD is 8.5 when mean is 27.6 and for the last 3 years’ average of data set the SD is 11.66 when mean is 66.74, which implies that the spread is more in the last 3 years’ 
average of data set than the first 3 years’ average.
It also shows the rank of HIG states from top to bottom on the initial 3 years’ average of data set which 
is as follows: Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Kerala, Gujarat, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and West Bengal. For the last 3 years’ average of data set, the sequence is as follows: Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Punjab, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Haryana. Findings suggest that except Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Rajasthan, all the states have changed their positions. Punjab, Kerala, Maharashtra and West Bengal have performed better in the recent period whereas Gujarat, Haryana and Andhra Pradesh have shifted down the ladder.
It also shows the sequence of LIG states from top to bottom on the initial 3 years’ average of data set 
which is as follows: Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh, and for the last 3 years’ average of data set the sequence is as follows: Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha and Assam. Except Odisha, the sequence is changed for every LIG state, Madhya Pradesh and Assam lost their posi-tions, while Bihar and Uttar Pradesh has improved their positions. 
Figure 1 shows the comparison between states of HIG and states of LIG on the two data points. It can 
be seen that the rate of change in average of LIG states is more than the same of HIG states during the study period. Therefore, the penetration of mobile phones per 100 populations in LIG states has improved.
4.1.2 Pattern of Access to Telephones
This subsection analyses the pattern of access to telephones in the Indian states.
Table 2 shows the penetration of telephones per 100 populations. It is evident from the table that there 
is a rise in the usage of telephones in all the 15 states irrespective of the group they belong to.
The number of people using mobile phones in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, 
Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal is around 21, 23, 22, 24, 31, 26, 30, 19, 
32 and 17 per 100 populations, respectively, on an average in the years, 2007–08, 2008–2009 and 2009–10, which increased to approximately 45, 53, 44, 52, 53, 52, 58, 42, 61 and 42 per 100 populations, respectively, on an average in the years, 2014–15, 2015–16 and 2016–17 in HIG. 
The number of people using mobile phones in Assam, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Uttar 
Pradesh is approximately 11, 12, 16, 12 and 13 per 100 populations, respectively, on an average in the years, 2007–08, 2008–09 and 2009–10, which increased to approximately 29, 36, 43, 36 and 35 per 100 populations, respectively, on an average in the years, 2014–15, 2015–16 and 2016–17 in LIG.
The SD shows the spread of the data that is the distance from the mean. For the initial 3 years’ average 
of data set, the SD is 7.02 when the mean is 20.51, and for last 3 years’ average of data set the SD is 9.15 
when the mean is 45.35, which implies that the spread is more in the last 3 years’ average of data set than in the initial years’ average. Agarwal and Panda 43
It also shows the sequence of HIG states from top to bottom on the initial 3 years’ average of data set, 
which is as follows: Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Punjab, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat, Haryana, Andhra 
Pradesh, Rajasthan and West Bengal. For the last 3 years’ average of data set, the sequence is as follows: Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Kerala, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan and West Bengal.
Except Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan and West Bengal, all the states have changed their position; Punjab, 
Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh have performed better for the last 3 years’ average of data set; whereas Kerala, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Haryana have shifted down the ladder.
It also shows the rank of LIG states from top to bottom for the initial 3 years’ average of data sets, 
which is as follows: Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Bihar and Assam. And for the last 3 years’ average of data set, the sequence is as follows: Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and Assam.
From the above ranking, it is evident that Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Assam continued on the simi-
lar positions. But Bihar shifted above and exchanged the position with Uttar Pradesh.
Figure 2 shows the comparison between states of HIG and states of LIG during the two data points. It can 
be seen that the rate of change in average of LIG states is more than the rate of change is average of HIG states. Therefore, improvement in access to telephones per 100 populations is faster in LIG states in the last decade.
4.1.3 Pattern of Access to Internet
In this subsection, the pattern of access to Internet facilities is shown.
Table 3 shows the penetration of Internet per 100 population. It is evident from the table that there is 
rise in the usage of internet services in all the 15 states irrespective of the group they belong to.
The number of people using internet services in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, 
Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal is approximately 0.9, 1, 0.8, 1.6, 2.1, 0.4, Figure 1. Comparison between States of HIG (High Income Group) and States of LIG (Low Income Group) in

The number of people using mobile phones in Assam, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Uttar 
Pradesh is approximately 0.2, 0.1, 3.2, 0.3 and 0.3 per 100 populations, respectively, on an average in the years, 2007–08, 2008–09 and 2009–10, which increased to approximately 21, 19, 26, 19 and 19 per 100 populations, respectively, on an average in the years, 2014–15, 2015–16 and 2016–17 in LIG.
The SD shows the spread of the data that is the distance from the mean. For the initial 3 years’ average 
of data set, the SD is 0.87 when mean is one, and for the last 3 years’ average of data set, the SD is 10.4 when mean is 28.87, which implies that the spread is much more in the last 3 years’ average of data set than in the initial years’ average.
It also shows the ranking of HIG states from top to bottom on the initial 3 years’ average of data. The

Bengal, Rajasthan and Maharashtra. Similarly for the last 3 years’ average of data set, the rank of the 
states from the highest to the lowest is as follows: Punjab, Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Gujarat, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and West Bengal.
Except Haryana and Rajasthan, all the states have changed their position; Punjab and Maharashtra 
have performed better in the sequence for the last 3 years of data set; whereas Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal have shifted down the ladder.
Other inferences can be taken for sequencing of the LIG states from top to bottom on the initial 3 years’ 
average of data set, which is as follows: Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Assam and Bihar. And for last 3 years’ average of data set the sequence is as follows: Madhya Pradesh, Assam, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Except Madhya Pradesh and Bihar, all others have changed their positions. Assam has improved its position and on the other hand Odisha and Uttar Pradesh shifted one position down.
Figure 3 clearly indicates that the rate of change in average of LIG states is more than the rate of 
change in average of HIG states. Therefore, penetration of Internet is more in LIG states than in HIG states in the decade (2008–17).
4.1.4 Information and Communication Technology Access Index
The ICT access index is constructed using PCA for the two time periods using all the three variables. 
Table 4 shows that for the initial 3 years of the data set, Tamil Nadu is at the first position and Odisha at the last position. And for the last 3 years of the data set, Tamil Nadu maintains the first position, and Assam shifts to the last position. 
It can be observed that Kerala, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Assam have not per -
formed well in the last decade and therefore lost their positions and shifted down the ladder in the last Figure 2. Comparison between States of HIG (High Income Group) and States of LIG (Low Income Group) in

3 years on the data set. Other states have either maintained or upgraded their positions. Also states 
such as Bihar, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh improved their position but still rank among the last five states. They need to focus on the penetration of ICT technologies, so as to provide their people a better access to ICT facilities.
4.2 Convergence of Information and Communication Technology Variables among the 
Indian States
The three ICT variables which are discussed in this study are telephones, mobile phones and Internet 
services. These are very essential ICT facilities to which everybody needs to have access, irrespective of income disparities across states. So it is important to understand whether there is a convergence in access Table 3. Internet Users Per 100 Population

to ICT facilities among the Indian states in the last decade. This section analyses the issue of conver -
gence of the basic ICT facilities in the Indian states.
4.2.1 Sigma Convergence of ICT Variables among 15 Major States over a Decade  
(from 2007–08 to 2016–17)
Sigma convergence approach measures variation in access to ICT indicators among regions. Here, 
sigma convergence is used to observe the variation in the ICT variables: telephone users, Internet users and mobile phone users (all in unit per 100 population). The standard deviation is used to show the sigma convergence.
Figure 4 shows the line graph of standard deviation of the ICT variables. The SD_telephone is diverging 
for the initial 4 years (2008–11) of the decade and afterward converges for the rest of the 6 years (2012–17) of the decade. The SD_mobilephones also diverges for the initial 5 years (2008–12) and then converges for the rest of the 5 years (2013–17). The SD_Internet is diverging for the whole decade; there is no conver -
gence in the variable of Internet per 100 populations. Therefore, low-income states are growing faster in access to telephone and mobile phones than the same in high-income states. However, the access to Internet services in low-income states has not grown to the extent that is required to achieve convergence.
4.2.2 Beta Convergence of ICT Variables among 15 Major States over a Decade  
(from 2007–08 to 2016–17)
In order to find beta convergence coefficients, the specific equation which has been used is as follows:
 Ln(Y) = a + bT + e,Figure 3. Comparison between States of HIG (High Income Group) and States of LIG (Low Income Group) in

where, b is trend growth rate and the same for different indicators are alternatively regressed on the 
initial value of those Indicators to find convergence coefficients. The beta convergence coefficients for 
these variables are shown in Table 5.
Table 5 shows that beta coefficients for telephone users and mobile users in the Indian states emerge 
to be statistically significant and negative. These results indicate that there is a convergence in the last decade in access to telephones and mobile phones for the major Indian states. The beta coefficient did not emerge to be significant for the indicator Internet users for the Indian states. However, the coefficient of Internet users is positive.
For mobile users and telephone users, sigma and beta convergence are consistent as both signify con-
vergence. But as the beta coefficient for Internet users did not emerge to be significant, standard devia -
tion will be taken into account for analysing the convergence. As indicated from the standard deviation for Internet users, there is divergence. So it is observed that there is a convergence among Indian states in the access to telephones and mobile phones during the period, 2008–17. However, the low-income states have to improve their Internet facilities in increasing access as to converge with that of the high-income states.
5. Conclusion
The main objective of the study was to verify the pattern of digital divide in access to ICT facilities and convergence of the same among Indian states in the last 10 years. It is observed from the study that there is a change in the pattern of access to ICT facilities in Indian states in the last one decade. All 15 major Indian states have embraced the ICT technologies, and the public access to ICT facilities has been improved in the last decade. However, the divide in access to ICT facilities across Indian states is clearly evident. Lower income states are lagging in access to ICT facilities than the high-income states. Among HIG of states, Tamil Nadu has maintained its position on the top for variables of mobile phones and telephones. Similarly, Madhya Pradesh has maintained its top position among LIG of states for variables such as telephone users and Internet users. The ranking of the states using PCA scores shows that Tamil Nadu maintains its first positions and Assam has shifted to the last. Low-performing states such as Table 5.

Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam, Bihar, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh should take steps to improve the 
access of ICT facilities to provide better access to people and upgrade their ranks.
The analysis of convergence and divergence suggests that variables such as telephone and mobile 
phone users per 100 populations are converging in the latter part of the study period. But on the other hand, for Internet user per 100 populations still there is divergence across the Indian states. The LIG of states are growing on a better pace than HIG of states in providing access to telephone and mobile phones but not in access to Internet services. 
So it is observed from the study that more or less the use of the telephone and mobile phones have 
increased across states and the lower income states are converging with the higher income states. However, there is evidence of divergence in the use of Internet facilities. So the government’s attention in improving these facilities in low-income states, particularly rural areas and lagging districts, is impor -
tant. Special policies and schemes need to be devised to promote the access of Internet services in the lagging states.
