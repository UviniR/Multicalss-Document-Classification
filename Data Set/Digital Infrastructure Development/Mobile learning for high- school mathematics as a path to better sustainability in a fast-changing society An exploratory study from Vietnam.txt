The use of mobile learning, or M-learning, has been increasingly appreciated by educa -
tors due to its sustainability potential in different facets such as finance (i.e., affordable 
cost) and flexibility (i.e., time and pace of learning). However, it may not be effective in 
all situations. This study explored the feasibility of using M-learning for students’ self-
study of mathematics in the context of Vietnamese high schools. Using 542 student 
and 40 teacher responses to two surveys, the study showed that the use of M-learning 
might not be feasible for students’ self-study of mathematics due to difficulties related 
to accessing mathematics websites, the quality of mathematics website content, stu -
dents’ low level of self-learning ability and learning disengagement. This study suggests 
that the use of M-learning may contribute to the sustainability of education; adopt -
ing it should be based on a critical examination of contextual factors, especial ly stu -
dents’ self-learning ability and engagement. M-learning can be promising and benefi -
cial to students due to its capability to equip students to prepare for the fast-c hanging 
and technological-driven world. Educators have increasingly appreciated the use of 
M-learning, because it becomes more affordable and flexible. Nonetheless, there is still 
a question about near-future adoptions of M-learning due to unavailability of and in -
accessibility to quality contents from trusted maths websites. The propensity of student 
engagements in M-learning is also an important issue for future research.Trinh Thi Phuong Thao (Vietnam),  Lai Dao Thai (Vietnam),  Hai Trinh Thanh (Vietnam),

INTRODUCTION
Mobile phones have become an essential part of young people’s life 
nowadays. Therefore, many educators have attempted to make good 
use of these devices for improving students’ learning experience, cre -
ating a new trend in education called mobile learning or M-learning. 
According to Mcconatha, Praul, and Lynch (2008), M-learning is em -
ployed through the use of small computing mobile devices such as 
smartphones and small handheld devices. Others simply consider 
M-learning ad an extension of distance learning (Al-Emran, Elsherif , 
& Shaalan, 2016) or e-learning (Alzaza & Yaakub, 2011). More broadly, 
Matias and Wolf (2013) see that M-learning not only includes mobile 
device-based learning, but also the learning that is mediated across 
multiple contexts using portable mobile devices. 
Since its arrival, M-learning has been used in different levels of educa -
tion, but mostly in mathematics, language, engineering and co mputer © Trinh Thi Phuong Thao, Lai Dao

http://dx.doi.org/10.21511/ppm.17(2).2019.30science (Crompton, Burke, & Gregory, 2017; Hwang & Tsai, 2011; Sabah, 201 6). This learning approach 
affords students the opportunities to connect informal virtual learni ng experiences with formal ones, 
increasing their overall learning experiences (Motiwalla, 2007) . With M-learning, students can access 
course materials, share ideas and attain formative evaluation and feedba ck, and obtain guidance from 
educators (Ciampa, 2014; Milošević, Živković, Manasijević, & Nikol ić, 2015; Valerie M. Crawford, 2007), 
and thus quality of learning would be enhanced accordingly (Klimova, 201 9). From a financial per -
spective, M-learning would also be a solution for students to access to affor dable education; which, in 
turn, results in enhancement of equity issue (Latchem, 2018). In brief, pr evious literature expected that 
M-learning, along with another type of ed-tech solutions such as e-lear ning, would contribute to the 
sustainability of education in both quality and finance aspects. 
However, the effectiveness of this learning design should not be taken for g ranted, because it is depend -
ent on several factors. In a recent study, Sabah (2016) found that students’ p erceived usefulness and per -
ceived ease of use, as well as the influence of others, could drive students’ in tention to use M-learning. 
Sabah (2016) also found that availability of M-services and mobile limit ations (Internet speed, screen, 
and keypad of the device, etc.) were the biggest obstacles of M-learning. Students’ ability to handle 
mobile devices, level of mobile usage, and frequent use of M- learning were further identified as deter -
minants that can influence students to adopt M-learning. Students’ perc eived usefulness, ease of use 
and their self-efficacy in using M-learning have been consistent ly reported to be influential on students’ 
intention to adopt M-learning across different countries (Althunib at, 2015; Sabah, 2016; Park, 2009). 
Even when all of the conditions above are satisfied, it seems that the effective ness of M-learning would 
also require a high level of student engagement, especially w hen it is used as a complementary channel 
to enhance students’ learning experience. Without student engageme nt, which may be associated with 
their beliefs about the benefits of using M-learning and expectations of o thers, that purpose will not be 
achieved regardless of the availability of mobile devices, M -learning services, and their M-learning lit -
eracy (for example, see Heflin, Shewmaker, & Nguyen, 2017).
In Vietnam, M-learning has recently been introduced and adopted across d ifferent educational provid -
ers. The Ministry of Education and Training also recommends that schools ac ross the country should 
use information and communication technologies (ICT) to enhance their t eaching-learning activities. 
However, there have been only a few studies about how ICT is being used in Vietnam ese schools (Le 
et al., 2019). To help narrow that research gap, this article will report an exp loratory study about the 
feasibility of using M-learning to foster Vietnamese students’ self -study of Math in two high schools. 
The study showed that despite technological availability, M-learning i s not very feasible to apply in 
Vietnamese high-school contexts for students’ self-study o f Math due to difficulty in accessing Math 
websites, quality of Math website content, student disengagement, wh ich was fundamentally caused 
by their low level of self-study ability. Despite its exploratory nature , the study lays the foundation for 
future studies which examine student engagement when designing lear ning mode using M-learning to 
ensure feasibility and effectiveness. 
1. LITERATURE REVIEW
1.1. Student engagement and 
learning outcomes
Student engagement has lately received due atten -
tion from educators and researchers, because it has 
been found to affect students’ learning outcomes. 
It is defined as “the range of activities a learner 
employs to generate – sometimes consciously, oth -er times unconsciously – the interest, focus, and 
an intention required to build knowledge and 
skills” (Toshalis & Nakkula, 2012 , p. 16 ). Others 
consider it as “time and effort students devote to 
educationally purposeful activities” (Radloff & 
Coates, 2010 , p. 1). It has also been defined as “par -
ticipation in educationally effective practices, both 
inside and outside the classroom, which leads to a 
range of measurable outcomes” (Harper & Quaye, 
2009, p. 2).394Problems and Perspectives in Management, Volume 17, Issue 2, 2019
http://dx.doi.org/10.21511/ppm.17(2).2019.30Student engagement can be seen in three di -
mensions: behavior, cognition, and emotion. 
The behavior dimension can be demonstrated 
in students’ adherence to rules, involvement in 
learning, and participation in extra-curricular 
activities (Fredricks, Blumenfeld, & Paris, 2004). 
Cognitive engagement dimension is frequently 
described in association with students’ self-reg -
ulation and effective use of deep learning strate -
gies (Fredricks et al., 2004), as well as their char -
acteristics such as motivation, self-efficacy, and 
expectations (Shane R. Jimerson, Emily Campos, 
& Jennifer L. Greif, 2003). Affective or emotion -
al engagement dimension is showed in students’ 
sense of belonging (Libbey, 2004), as well as im -
mediate emotions, such as enjoyment and inter -
est in the task (Furlong et al., 2003). The affective 
dimension distinguishes students with intrinsic 
motivations from those with extrinsic motiva -
tions. The former is motivated to engage cogni -
tively and behaviorally out of their passion and 
interest in the learning, whereas the latter is mo -
tivated to attain tangible results such as scores 
and certificates.
Several researchers also investigate student en -
gagement in the opposite direction: student 
disengagement or alienation (Johnson, 2005; 
Macfarlane & Tomlinson, 2017; Mann, 2001). 
This may occur in the form of students’ refusal 
to comply with behavioral expectations such as 
coming to class punctually, politely accepting 
grades and feedback, or enthusiastically partici -
pating in in-class learning activities (Macfarlane 
& Tomlinson, 2017).
Many studies have shown that social context con -
tributes to student engagement levels. For exam -
ple, Mann (2001) identifies that disciplinary pow -
er, academic culture, and an excessive focus on 
performativity can cause student disengagement. 
Similarly, Thomas (2002) argues that institution -
al habitus, which is social and cultural practices 
that favor the dominant social groups in an in -
stitution, may lead to poor retention of non-tra -
ditional students. Initial experience with a new 
learning culture may cause cultural and learning 
shock to several students, which may also cause 
student disengagement (Christie, Tett, Cree, 
Hounsell, & McCune, 2008; Krause & Coates, 
2008; Thomas, 2002). Student engagement is a key contributor to qual -
ity learning outcomes. Research has evidenced 
that student engagement is associated with high -
er grades and school completion rates context 
(Fredricks et al., 2004; Wang & Fredricks, 2014; 
Wang & Holcombe, 2010). Their engagement al -
so appears to associate with the perceived insti -
tutional or school context (Fredricks et al., 2004; 
Wang & Fredricks, 2014; Wang & Holcombe, 
2010). For example, in a longitudinal study, Wang 
and Holcombe (2010) examined the relationships 
among 1,046 middle school students’ perceptions 
of the school environment, school engagement, 
and academic achievement. They found three di -
mensions of school engagement: school participa -
tion, sense of identification with school, and use of 
self-regulation strategies. Students’ perceptions of 
the school environment were found to influence 
their academic achievement directly and indirect -
ly through the three types of school engagement. 
Likewise, Konold, Cornell, Jia, and Malone (2018) 
tested whether the authoritative school climate, 
which has high structure and student support, 
can nurture student engagement and whether 
these factors are associated with higher academic 
achievement. Using a multilevel multi-informant 
structural model on a sample of 60,441 students 
and 11,442 teachers in 298 high schools, the re -
searchers found that both structure and student 
support in authoritative schools were associated 
with higher student engagement in schools. They 
also found that student engagement was directly 
associated with academic achievement. 
All these show that student engagement is critical 
for students’ learning outcomes. However, their 
engagement should not be taken for granted, but 
would be affected by both personal factors, learn -
ing environment, and even culture. Therefore, in 
designing new ways of learning, student engage -
ment issues should be paid due attention to ensure 
quality learning outcomes.
1.2. M-learning as a measure 
contributing to the sustainability 
of education 
Sustainability of education has identified as a key 
background for the development of socio-eco -
nomics. In 2015, the United Nations identified 17 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with 169 395Problems and Perspectives in Management, Volume 17, Issue 2, 2019
http://dx.doi.org/10.21511/ppm.17(2).2019.30targets in total, of which there are one goal (SDG4) 
and ten targets about the education sector. Recent 
research has shown that M-learning could help 
increase students’ learning experience (Milošević 
et al., 2015; Sung, Chang, & Liu, 2016), thus, re -
sulting in the enhancement of sustainability in 
education. One of the high-profile studies was 
(Milošević et al.’ (2015) work summarizing the 
benefits of M-learning as follows:
• interaction: students can synchronously or 
asynchronously interact with the teacher and 
their friends;
• portability: mobile devices are lighter than 
books to carry and allow students to take notes, 
type text, record sound, and even videos;
• cooperation: it enables easier cooperation 
among students, even in remote locations;
• engagement: students now like to use mobile 
devices;
• practicality: students can study whenever they 
have time;
• equity: it can provide equal learning opportu -
nities to all students;
• speed: it takes a lot of time to prepare tradi -
tional learning materials; materials for mobile 
learning can be prepared, stored, and reused 
relatively quickly;
• retention of knowledge: mobile learning is 
a powerful learning tool that provides quick 
reminding and adding materials to already 
learned;
• cost: it reduces the cost of printing literature 
compared to the traditional learning mode;
• management: it enables to tracking student 
learning behaviors.
Unfortunately, there are also some disadvantages 
to using M-learning. There should be M-learning 
services that develop and design online learn -
ing resources and activities for students to learn. 
These activities must be interesting and conducive to learning to retain students. Likewise, students 
need to possess mobile devices, which efficiently 
allow them to access the online learning materi -
als in diverse forms: text, video, audio, interactive 
games, etc. Without a device that can show these 
forms of information/data, it will hinder a stu -
dent from effective learning (N. Ibrahim, Salisu, 
Popoola, & T. Ibrahim, 2014). Also, due to their 
small sizes and limited battery life, mobile devic -
es may cause difficulties for students to learn. The 
Internet speed and students’ abilities to use the 
device, as well as the M-learning service/websites, 
would also affect their engagement with this form 
of learning. Price is also a problem, since mobile 
devices with better features are usually expensive, 
and fee for accessing M-learning platforms should 
also be taken into account. 
All of the mentioned disadvantages, on the one 
hand, may affect the feasibility of using M-learning 
as it depends much on the availability of technolo -
gies and users’ skills in using it. On the other hand, 
the advantages could only be achieved with student 
engagement, on top of technological prerequisites. 
Naturally, students often feel confused when they 
are exposed to a new way of learning. If they fail 
to manipulate mobile devices, navigate the web -
sites to look for learning resources or engage with 
an online learning activity, or poor quality of the 
text, image, and sounds on their mobile devices 
would discourage them from embracing the new 
learning mode. Disconfirmation experienced in 
the learning process was also known as a predic -
tor for poor student loyalty (Pham, Lai, & Vuong, 
2019). In the same vein, if M-learning is used as a 
channel for self-study, it also requires students to 
be able to self-direct their learning and to learn 
independently with enthusiasm. Otherwise, they 
may not achieve the expected learning outcomes.
1.3. The context of using M-learning 
in Vietnamese schools
Vietnam is a middle-income country in Southeast 
Asia with appropriately 90 million people. It is 
among the societies with the fastest chance thanks 
to the growing ICT industry. Recent socio-eco -
nomic development not only improves its people’s 
quality of life, but also affords them the opportu -
nities to possess modern gadgets, including the 
latest luxurious mobile devices such as the iPhone. 396Problems and Perspectives in Management, Volume 17, Issue 2, 2019
http://dx.doi.org/10.21511/ppm.17(2).2019.30It is estimated that in 2017, there are about 84% of 
the population in key cities, 71% in secondary cit -
ies and 68% in rural areas were using smartphones 
(Vietnam News, 2017). According to Statista, there 
were 45.5 million Vietnamese participating in 
Facebook, and this figure is expected to reach 52.4 
million in 2025 (Statista, 2019). Although high-
school students are commonly expected not to use 
mobile phones in the classroom, it is observed that 
out of the school, almost all students own a mobile 
phone, a laptop, or a notebook. 
In response to the MOET’s call for applying 
ITC into teaching and learning (for example, 
MOET, 2018), several schools have experiment -
ed M-learning, and the private organization has 
started to provide M-learning services, especially 
in natural science subjects and English. Websites, 
where students can access learning materials, are 
also abundant. For example, for Mathematics, stu -
dents can get access to diendantoanhoc.net, toan -
hoc247.edu.com, luyenthi123.com, mathvn.com, 
etc. These are considered the most prestigious 
websites for self-study of Mathematics, which at -
tract tens of thousands of students due to quality 
Mathematics lessons and exercises.
One of the biggest challenges for the use of 
M-learning could be students’ self-study ability. In 
a Confucian heritage country, students often rely 
on their teachers to direct their learning (Nghia, 
Phuong, & Huong, 2018; Thanh, 2010). Teachers of -
ten hold much power in the classroom and decide 
almost everything related to students’ learning 
(Tran, Le, & Nguyen, 2014; Nguyen, 2017). Even 
when students are not happy, they are expected to 
keep silent and follow the teachers. That learning 
environment suppresses students’ ability to con -
duct learning in their way effectively. In the same 
vein, it is increasingly reported that Vietnamese 
students do not meaningfully engage with their 
learning, but only superficially participate in it for 
high scores (Nghia et al., 2018). Therefore, when 
it comes to using M-learning for their self-study, 
they may not fully engage with it if teachers are 
not around. As discussed earlier, this situation 
would limit the effectiveness of M-learning. 
However, these are only my individual observa -
tion. There has virtually not been any study that 
explores the feasibility of using M-learning in Vietnam. Therefore, it is vital to examine this issue 
before implementing M-learning in Vietnamese 
high schools. This can help reduce unnecessary 
waste and increase the chance of success for the 
implementation of M-learning in this context.
2. RESEARCH METHODS  
AND DESIGN
This article is drawn from a research project about 
the M-learning for Mathematics in Vietnamese 
high schools, which was conducted between 2013 
and 2016. In this article, the researcher will report 
the feasibility of using M-learning for self-study of 
Mathematics among year 12 students in the current 
context of Vietnamese high schools. The research 
question was: How feasible is it to use M-learning 
for students’ self-study of Mathematics in the cur -
rent context of Vietnamese high schools? A quan -
titative approach was used to find answers to the 
research questions, because it would generate de -
scriptive statistical results that could better illus -
trate the issue under investigation. 
The researcher looked for data in the following 
dimensions to assess the feasibility of M-learning 
implementation as a complementary channel for 
students’ learning of Mathematics: 
• students’ accessibility to M-learning (posses -
sion of mobile devices, Internet connection, 
etc.);
• students’ ability to use mobile phones (i.e., 
their mobile phone literacy);
• students’ self-study ability and behavioral en -
gagement with learning Mathematics after class.
A total of 524 year 12 students and 40 Mathematics 
teachers in two high schools, which were based in 
Thai Nguyen province, were involved in this study. 
An elite high school and a ‘normal” high school 
were purposefully chosen to represent two differ -
ent types of high schools in Vietnam. The former 
is comprised of students with average learning 
abilities, whereas the last includes high caliber stu -
dents who were selected carefully with a compet -
itive entrance exam. Although there were private 
high schools, the researcher observed that it was 397Problems and Perspectives in Management, Volume 17, Issue 2, 2019
http://dx.doi.org/10.21511/ppm.17(2).2019.30not much different from the ‘normal’ high school; 
therefore, it was not included to save time and cost. 
Data were collected by two paper-based surveys, 
one for students and one for teachers. The surveys 
were sent to all year 12 students and Mathematics 
teachers of the two selected schools. By the deadline, 
524 responses from the students and 40 responses 
from the teachers were received. The survey was 
developed based on previous small talks with stu -
dents about their experience with M-learning, the 
literature, and the researchers’ experience. In the 
survey, students were asked to indicate their mo -
tivations for self-study of Mathematics, their en -
gagement with that self-learning, their use of mo -
bile phones for self-learning of Mathematics, and 
obstacles of their self-learning of Mathematics us -
ing mobile devices. Teachers were asked to assess 
students’ awareness of self-study, factors influenc -
ing students’ self-study behaviors and their beliefs 
about whether or not to use M-learning to foster 
students’ self-study of Mathematics.
Data were analyzed descriptively using frequen -
cies and percentages, which were ranked in a de -
scending order to accentuate the most significant 
variables. Where applicable, a comparison of dif -
ferences in the results between groups of students of the two schools is highlighted. Although this 
type of analysis is simple, it is effective to answer 
the research questions. 
3. FINDINGS
3.1. Students’ accessibility  
to M-learning and their skills  
in using mobile phones
Our survey at two high schools in Thai Nguyen prov -
ince showed that among 542 year 12 students, 526 of 
them (97.04%) owned a mobile phone. Among these 
students, 87.45% reported that their mobile phones 
could get access to the Internet properly (Table 1). 
The results also showed that their ability to use 
mobile phones was proficient. However, they used 
their phone for different purposes (Table 2). As a 
whole, the results showed that students seemed to 
use their mobile phones for general communica -
tion and entertainment purposes much more fre -
quently for learning purposes, especially for self-
study of Mathematics. Although there were differ -
ences in the percentages of using mobiles phone 
for communication and entertainment purposes 
between students of the gifted and normal high

http://dx.doi.org/10.21511/ppm.17(2).2019.30schools, students seemed to converge in their be -
haviors related to self-study of Mathematics. All 
of these activities were rated at the least frequent 
in their use of the mobile phone. These findings 
suggest that students were not engaged with using 
their mobile phones for self-study of Mathematics.
3.2. Students’ self-study ability  
and behavioral engagement
Data from 410 responses out of 524 students (114 
others could not arrange a time to answer the 
whole survey questionnaires and decided to with -
draw from the study) showed that students were 
motivated to self-study mainly to achieve a high 
score or to solve Mathematics exercises (Table 3). 
The percentage of participants who chose these 
two motivations were much higher than the oth -
er two motivations: (i) to systematically remember 
Mathematics theories and (ii) to diversify their 
knowledge of Mathematics. These findings sug -
gest that students had more extrinsic motivations 
for their Mathematics learning than intrinsic mo -
tivations. This can be a barrier for their self-study

Indeed, data showed that students were not en -
gaged with the self-learning of Mathematics after 
class. Almost 88% of them spent less than one hour 
on learning Mathematics on their own (Table 4).

strated their level of engagement to different ex -
tents, which also showed their ability to self-study 
(Table 5). It was recognizable from the results that 
students engaged with self-learning when it was 
associated with their compulsory learning activi -
ties and with teachers’ commands. The majority of 
them spent time reading again what their teacher 
taught in class (71.12%), reviewing the way to solve 
a particular Mathematics problem that was taught 
in class (68.04%), or doing Mathematics exercises 
that their teacher assigned (60.73%). 
Meanwhile, a low percentage of students spent 
time on activities that derived from their passion 
for learning Mathematics or to expand their math -
ematics knowledge and skills. For example, 27.31% 
of them looked for materials to expand their knowl -
edge on the Mathematics topic taught in class, 
20.73% did exercises in the Mathematics work -
book (without teachers’ requirement), and 8.29% 
challenged themselves by solving Mathematics 
problems in previous Mathematics olympiads. 
Having said so, it was found that more than one-
third of the students engaged with Mathematics 
learning after class to enrich their Mathematics 
solving skills by reading reference book (41.21%), 
look for and solve Mathematics exercises simi -
lar to what have been taught in class (31.95%) or 
solving Mathematics exercises in the Mathematics 
University Entrance Exam Workbook (28.78%).
These findings indicate that several students were 
dependent on their teachers’ instruction even in 
their self-learning, which is consistent with their 
extrinsic motivations above. However, there were 
also students who could self-direct their learning 
to achieve better Mathematics learning outcomes, 
despite a low number of them.

From teachers’ and the admin staff’s perspective, 
the majority of students were aware of their re -

lieved that students’ awareness was not adequately 
clear (51.92%). Just above a quarter of them be -
lieved that their students were fully aware of their 
responsibilities of self-learning.
The teachers and admin staff also reported that stu -
dents’ engagement with self-learning derived from 
four factors. Most of them believed that students 
engaged with learning when they were assigned by 
their teachers, followed by their wish to pass the 
university entrance exam, their superficial learn -
ing attitudes, and their wish to gain Mathematics 
knowledge and skills that suit their learning needs. 
Teachers were also asked about the feasibility of 
using M-learning for self-study of Mathematics of 
Vietnamese high-school students (Table 9). More 
than half of the teachers (55.0%) believed that it 
would not be feasibly used with students’ positive 
learning outcomes; 32.5% of them believed that it 
could be sued, but the impact on students’ learn -
ing outcomes was unsure. Only 12.5% of the teach -
ers believed that this would be a feasible measure 
for self-study of Mathematics, and the outcomes 
would be positive.

http://dx.doi.org/10.21511/ppm.17(2).2019.30DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
This study aimed to explore whether M-learning can be feasibly used as a channe l for Vietnamese high-
school students to self-study Mathematics. The feasibility was examine d through (i) students’ accessi -
bility to M-learning services, (ii) their ability to use mobile phones, ( ii) their self-learning ability and 
behavioral engagement with self-study. Generally, the results indi cated that it would not be very feasible 
to use M-learning for students’ self-study of mathematics without payin g due attention to improving 
students’ self-learning ability and engagement.
The results showed that the majority of students involved in this study posses s a mobile phone, however, 
not all of them (approximately 12.6%) can get access to the Internet where the y would search for a suitable 
Mathematics website to engage with their self-study. On top of that, the cost to ac cess Mathematics self-
study websites discouraged many students from participating in this mod ern learning mode. The Internet 
speed also disheartened those who attempted to look for an additional lear ning channel using M-learning. 
Therefore, not all students could get afforded the accessibility to M-lea rning, as noted in Sabah (2016). If 
Vietnamese schools and teachers request students to engage with this le arning mode, they should also 
take into account learning equity issues as not all students are financial ly able to pursue M-learning. Using 
M-learning may disadvantage students coming from low socio-economi c backgrounds.
Also, students seemed to adopt the ability to use mobile phones quickly . However, they often used their 
phone for basic functions such as calling or texting, or for entertainmen t purposes rather than for learn -
ing. About two-thirds of the students exchanged information about assig nment via Facebook, but the 
number of those engaged with self-learning Mathematics via the mobile pho ne was limited. These find -
ings were aligned with previous studies where students were found to behav e differently with mobile 
devices instead of learning (Althunibat, 2015; Sabah, 2016; Park, 200 9). However, students’ not using 
mobile phones to access to Mathematics websites could be due to their unaware ness of the availability 
of quality Mathematics websites. This suggested that if M-learning to be used fo r students’ self-study of 
Mathematics, school leaders and teachers would need to recommend studen ts relevant websites, which 
could attract students with new knowledge or exercises rather t han just repeating the textbook con -
tent. This also indicates that M-learning service providers should pay mo re attention to designing their 
website that allows meaningful learning activities, interactive le arning activities, game-based learning 
opportunities or real-life situations that invite students to use Mathe matics knowledge skills to solve 
instead of simply solving theory-based Mathematics puzzles. Cultura lly, this finding also demonstrates 
the cultural additivity phenomenon, which suggests Vietnamese cul ture is quick to add new values, but 
often without careful consideration (Vuong et al., 2018).
Moreover, students’ self-learning ability appeared to be the most chal lenging for using M-learning for 
their self-study of Mathematics. Results from both teachers and student s’ survey consistently showed 
that Vietnamese high-school students were very much dependent learne rs, a longstanding issue of ed -
ucation in Vietnam (Tran et al., 2014; Nghia et al., 2018). Only 8.29% of the stu dents believed that they 
could study independently without a teacher. After class, the majority of s tudents would revise the les -
sons that they were taught, often less than one hour per day, rather looking for opp ortunities to expand 
their knowledge on the topics. Many of them only participated in self-lear ning activities due to their 
teachers’ assignment. Several students could direct their self-st udy; yet, it appeared to be out of their 
extrinsic motivations of increasing their chance to pass the universit y entrance exam or to get a high 
score. Therefore, they seemed not to behaviorally engage with their learn ing due to their superficial 
learning attitudes and lack of awareness of their responsibilities o f self-study for improving their own 
Mathematics knowledge and skills, as their teachers reported. A lack of beha vioral engagement also 
questions the other dimensions of engagement: cognitive and affectiv e engagement (Fredricks et al., 
2004). Unfortunately, this study did not explore these two dimensions o f engagement, which should be 
explored further by future studies. 401Problems and Perspectives in Management, Volume 17, Issue 2, 2019
http://dx.doi.org/10.21511/ppm.17(2).2019.30Regardless of the mentioned limitation, the findings raise a big concern a bout the effectiveness of using 
M-learning for students’ self-study of Mathematics. Without an adequa te level of self-learning ability 
and engagement, students would not be able to use M-learning for such a purpose. Therefore, students’ 
awareness of the importance of learning for themselves and practical sk ills for self-learning should be 
nurtured and developed before implementing M-learning for Mathemati cs self-learning. To increase 
their learning engagement, Vietnamese high schools may wish to create a sc hool environment that 
meets students’ expectation, as described in Wang and Holcombe’s (201 0) longitudinal study. Feeling 
good about learning and having a sense of belonging would trigger students ’ passion for learning, which 
is the foundation of intrinsic motivation and trigger engagement (Fur long et al., 2003; Libbey, 2004). 
Likewise, creating an authoritative school climate with high structu re and student support can nurture 
student engagement (Konold et al., 2018). This could be applica ble in Vietnamese high-school context, 
because students there are often strictly monitored by their tea chers and supervisors, but there has been 
a lack of student support service, especially in terms of self-learning sk ills. The situation explains why 
Vietnamese high-school students are often obedient and dependent lea rners. Effective student learn -
ing support service would hopefully increase students’ self-learn ing ability, and within both authori -
tative and student-oriented school environment, students will bec ome more engaging. Only then will 
M-learning be used for students’ Mathematics self-learning. 
In short, mobile learning or M-learning can be promising and trendy. As the w orld is shifting to Industry 
4.0 and ‘computational entrepreneurship’ (Vuong, 2019), the abilit y to use M-learning effectively will 
also help students preparing for the fast-changing and technological -driven world. Furthermore, the 
use of M-learning has been increasingly appreciated by educators due to it s sustainability potential 
in different facets such as finance (i.e., affordable cost) and flexibility ( i.e., time and pace of learning). 
However, it seems that in the current context of Vietnamese hi gh schools, the adoption of it would not 
be very much feasible, as more than half of the teachers noted. Difficulties in acc essing the Mathematics 
websites, the content of these website, students’ habits of using mobile pho ne, and their self-study abil -
ity and learning engagement must be considered and studied thoroughly b y scientists to avoid wasteful 
science and help education policy makers ensuring a feasible and effectiv e implementation of this new 
mode of learning (Vuong, 2018). This study did not explore students’ pe rception of the ease of use and 
usefulness of M-learning. Future studies should explore these dimen sions when exploring the feasibility 
of using M-learning in an educational context, because they may be associa ted with student engagement 
with this learning mode.
