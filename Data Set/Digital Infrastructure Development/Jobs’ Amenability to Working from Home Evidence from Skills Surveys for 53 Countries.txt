The spread of COVID-19 and implementation of “social 
distancing” policies around the world have raised the ques -
tion of how many jobs can be done at home. This paper 
uses skills surveys from 53 countries at varying levels of 
economic development to estimate jobs’ amenability to 
working from home. The paper considers jobs’ charac -
teristics and uses internet access at home as an important 
determinant of working from home. The findings indi -
cate that the amenability of jobs to working from home 
increases with the level of economic development of the 
country. This is driven by jobs in poor countries being more 
intensive in physical/manual tasks, using less information and communications technology, and having poorer inter -
net connectivity at home. Women, college graduates, and 
salaried and formal workers have jobs that are more amena -
ble to working from home than the average worker. The 
opposite holds for workers in hotels and restaurants, con -
struction, agriculture, and commerce. The paper finds that 
the crisis may exacerbate inequities between and within 
countries. It also finds that occupations explain less than 
half of the variability in the working-from-home indexes 
within countries, which highlights the importance of using 
individual-level data to assess jobs’ amenability to working 
from home.

 1. Introduction  
The spread of COVID -19 and the implementation of “social distancing” policies around the world have 
raised the question of how many jobs can be done at home. Most of the e xisting efforts to estimate these 
figures rely on US -based measures  of the type of ta sks required by different occupations (Dingel & Neiman, 
2020a ; Avdiu & Nayyar, 2020 ; Mongey, Pilossoph, & Weinberg, 2020 ; Leibovici, Santacreu, & Famiglietti, 
2020) .1 However, the task content of jobs exhibits substantial variation across countries (Lo Bello, Sanchez -
Puerta,  & Winkler, 2019 ; Hardy, Lewandowski, Park, & Yang, 2018) . Differences in the organization of 
production or in the level of technology adoption across countries imply that the same occupation may be 
more intensive in face -to-face interactions or in physical tasks in poorer economies . As a result, using US-
based m easures to estimate the amenability  to working from h ome (WFH)  in developing countries may lead to 
biased conclusions.   
To overcome this challenge, this paper  uses  skill and  household surveys from 53 countries at different levels 
of economic development with rich information on the type of tasks carried out by people at work . We 
estimate indexes of the task content of jobs to rank them by their vulnerability to social distancing measures  
accord ing to their amenability to a remote setup . In addition, given that the  task data vary at the individual-
level—and not by occupation, as in the Occupational Information Network (O*NET ) classification —we 
show how the likelihood of being able to work from ho me correlates with other characteristics of the 
individual and his or her job.   
We build on the  literature by estimating jobs ’ amenability  to WFH , as opposed to estimating the fraction of 
jobs that can be done at home . Estimating the latter is challenging since choosing the  tasks that determine  
whether a person can work from home  is largely  arbitrary , specifically  if one does not have  a model linking 
such tasks to the probability of WFH during a  pandemic . Dingel & Neiman (2020b)  and Saltiel (2020)  
consider that an occupation cannot be performed from home if at least one of  several  conditions holds . For 
instance,  in the Dingel & Neiman (2020b)  study, some of categories  that are sufficient to consider that an 
occupation cannot be done at home  include  “Performing for or Working Directly with the Public is very 
important”,  “Handling and Moving Objects is very important” or “Repairing and Maintaining Electronic 
Equipment is very important .” However, occupational requirements can change during exc eptional 
conditions. For example, while for  professionals in communications or in law it is very important to have 
contact with the public , they can still carry out some  (but not all)  of their tasks using ICT (Information and 
Communication Technologies); craft workers for whom handling and moving objects is crucial may still be able to  sell their products through e -commerce ; individuals repa iring equi pment can still work on portable 
objects  at home , to name a few  examples . More generally, occupations comprise a bundle of tasks, and while 
 
1 An exception is Saltiel (2020) , who uses STEP surveys.  3 
 it may be optimal to work at a specific location and in face -to-face (F2F) contact with the public or co -workers, 
suboptimal work arrangements are also feasible for some occupations, particularly during a pandemic.2  
Another caveat of using  criteria where at least one sufficient condition  has to be satisfied  to categorize jobs i s 
that it is not clear how to choose the number of conditions to consider when several alternatives are available. 
If only one condition needs to be satisfied  to classify a n occupation as not being able to be done at home , 
then the more conditions  that the  researcher adds to the list, the higher are the chances that at least one of 
them will be satisfied by a given job.  For example, one of the data  sets used in this paper  includes  a battery of 
questions to measure F2F contact . Two of these question s are “ How often does your job usually involve 
sharing work -related information with co -workers? ” and “ How often does your job usually involve 
instructing, training or teaching people, individually or in groups? ” A priori, both are valid prox y variables  for 
F2F w ork, but while almost 100 percent of people respond “very often” to the first question in most 
countries , there is  substantially  more variation in the responses to the latter . More generally, the more 
questions we consider to measure F2F, the higher the fr action of workers that would be classified as having 
an F2F-intensive job. Discarding questions and data based on this empirical observation is  somewhat 
arbitrary.  
There are two studies that  are exceptions to the one -sufficient -condition criteria. Mongey et al. (2020)  
construct WFH and physical proximity measures for the United States  using O*NET data. For the WFH 
measure,  they use the same set of task variables as  Dingel & Neiman (2020 a, 2020b ), but instead of defining 
binary indicators, they allow both the WFH and physical proximity measures to var y between 0 and 1. 
Leibovici, Santacreu, & Famiglietti (2020)  construct a contact -intensity measure for the United States  using 
occupation- level information from O*NET and aggregating the possibl e scores for the question about 
performing tasks in close physical proximity to other people. The final measure can take a value from 0 to 
100. 
To measure jobs’ amenability to WFH , we exploit all the variables  available  in the data that describe  job tasks  
related to home -based work . Instead of using  a criterion based on satisfying at least one  sufficient condition  
to classify occupations , we argue that the more (less) the conditions that are satisfied, the lower  (higher) the 
amenability of  a given job to be carried out at home. For example,  according to our criteria,  a job that satisfies 
three conditions would be less amenable to home -based -work than one that satisfies only one or two of those 
conditions.  Accordingly, we also exploit catego rical variables describing the intensity of different tasks, 
instead of transforming them into binary outcomes . While this approach still relies on the assumption that all 
 
2 As a robustness check, we construct an index following a methodology more similar to that of Dingel and N eiman 
(2020a, 2020b) and Saltiel (2020) where only one condition needs to be satisfied in order for a job not to be amenable to 
WFH and find that it is highly correlated with our WFH measures (see Figure A 3 ).  4 
 characteristics related to the probability  of working  from  home  have the same weight, it exploits  more 
information than a binary approach.  
We use four groups of tasks to assess jobs’ amenability to WFH . First, we use measures of physical intensity 
and manual work to capture tasks that are more likely to be location- specific —because they require handling 
large items or use specific equipment, for example —and cannot be done at home. Second, we use measures 
of F2F -intensive tasks such as those that involve supervision or contact with the public. Third, we create an 
index  of ICT use at work, to reflect the fact that while some jobs may require substantial F2F intensity, some 
of such tasks can be carried out using ICT and do not necessarily  have to be  done in -person. Finally , and in 
contrast to existing studies, we also exp loit information on having an internet connection at home as an 
important factor to determine the likelihood of a remote setup . This is important since workers in developing 
countries who may use ICT and  have internet connectivity at the workplace, do  not necessarily  have access to 
the same resources  at home.  Another reason why  we estimate the amenability —and not the fraction —of jobs 
that can be performed remotely for such  a large set of countries is that  several of the surveys were collected 
circa 2012, when internet connectivity was significantly lower than today . However, under the assumption 
that relative connectivity across countries or types of workers remained stable, our estimates can still be used  
to compare the WFH measures across these categories.3 
We find  that the social distancing measures associated with  COVID -19 may exacerbate the jobs divide that 
preceded the crisis. The jobs intensive in tasks that are amenable to WFH are more prevalent in richer 
countries, and among workers with high levels of education , in salaried employment and with access to social 
insurance. Low -income , self-employed , and informal workers are not only less likely to do  their jobs when 
WFH is the only option, but also less likely  to have access to income protection schemes  if these  are 
channeled through the existing social security infrastructure.    
Our findings highlight the importance of social protection programs to safeguard  the most vulnerable during 
the crisis. Efforts to reach informal workers are crucial since they are less likely to have access to existing 
social insurance benefits, and also to additional programs launched in response to the crisis through the social 
security or tax administration infrastructures.  Our results also show the importance of fostering technology 
adoption to protect jobs while respecting social distancing measures. To a large extent, the between and 
within country divide in WFH amenabil ity is driven by unequal access to ICT. These benefits of digital 
technologies should be considered by governments in developing  countries when investing in broadband 
infrastructure.  
 
3 In fact, the coefficient of correlation between the share of internet users by country in 2012 vs 2017 is 0.94 (own 
estimates based on data from World Development Indicators, WDI).  5 
 Finally, it is important to mention that this paper  does not consider the  role of essential sectors or workers 
(whose jobs are not affected by social distancing measures) since there is substantial heterogeneity in these 
policies between and within countries  that cannot be fully accounted for in this paper .4 Our individual -level 
measures of WFH amenability, however, can be used to assess the potential impacts of essential work 
policies.  
The rest of this paper  is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the data  and the main features of the 
methodology. Section 3 describes the results and Section 4 concludes. The paper  includes an Appendix with 
more detailed information on the methodology, and the estimated indexes by detailed socioeconomic group and country.  
 
2. Data 
We use three data  sets covering 53  countries at different levels of development  to estimate  our WFH measure  
(see Table 1 ). First, we use the Surveys of Adult Skills of PIAAC (Programme for the International 
Assessment of Adult Competencies) for 35 countries. This survey collects information about working -age 
individuals and covers both rural and urban areas. Second , we use the STEP (Skills Towards Employability 
and Productivity) surveys  for 15 developing countries .
5 The surveys are representative of urban areas  (except 
Sri Lanka and the Lao  People’s Democratic Republic , which included both urban and rural areas)  and collect 
information about working -age individuals.  Finally, we use the Labor Market Panel Surveys (LMPS) for three 
countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, na mely the Arab Republic of Egypt, Jordan 
and Tunisia. These are standard labor force surveys that, in addition to the typical labor market information, 
also collect data about specific tasks carried out at work.  Our final sample for all three data  sets incl udes 
employed  individuals age s 16 to 64 years.  
  
 
4  Garrote Sanchez, Gomez Parra, Ozden, & Rijkers (2020)  consider the role of essential workers in their assessment of 
WFH measures in the European Union.  
5 We exclude China since the data are  only representative of Yunnan province. There is no STEP survey for El Salvador, 
thereby we use instead a skills survey that includes a similar question naire.  6

Table 2  shows the  type s of tasks used to estimate the WFH index, Appendix 1 describes the rationale for 
choosing these tasks, and Table A 1  in A ppendix 2 shows the complete  list of variables. Such variables  are 
slightly different across  the three  data sets. For example, while STEP has information on whether the job 
requires contact with customers, such information is not collected in the LMPS for Jordan and Tunisia. 
Thereby, while the indexes can be compared across countries within the STEP , PIAAC and L MPS data sets, 
comparisons are not possible across them .

3. Results  
3.1 Cross -country results  
Figure 1  shows the correlation between the  physical/manual and F2F task indexes and GDP per capita. The 
magnitude of the indexes is  equivalent to the number of standard deviation s above /below the average worker 
among all the countries in the sample. For example , a physical /manual index equal to 0.45 in the case of 
Turkey ( Figure 1 , panel ( a)) means that jobs in Turkey are on average 0.45 standard deviations above that of 
the average worker among PIAAC countries in terms of physical /manual intensity. Richer countries have 
jobs less intensive in physical/manual skills  (Figure 1 , panels (a) and (c)) . This factor would tend to reduce  the 
amenability  of jobs to be done at home  disproportionately among poorer countries, given that their jobs 
would tend to be more location or equipment -specific according to this measure . In contrast, the intensity of 
jobs in F2F tasks tends to increase with economic development ( Figure 1 , panels (b) and (d)) . This is driven 
by jobs  intensive in non -routine interpersonal tasks , whose duties  require more supervision or contact with 
the public.

Note:  The vertical axis measures the corresponding task index, in standard deviations from the mean for all  PIAAC/STEP  countries. GDP per capita 
PPP comes from the World Development Indicators (WDI) and corresponds to the same year of the respective PIAAC and S TEP survey s. 
 
The fact that the intensity of jobs on physical/manual tasks tends to decline with economic development, and 
that the intensity on F2F tasks shows the opposite pattern suggests that two opposing  forces are at play when 
shaping the relationshi p between WFH measures and GDP per capita. However, F2F  occupations also tend 
to be more intensive in ICT use.  As seen in  Figure 2 , countries such as Singapore or the United States  that 
have jobs more intensive in F2F tasks also use more ICT at work  than countries such as Lithuania or 
Kazakhstan. That is, several of the t asks embedded in such occupations are more prone to be performed 
remotely. In other words, ICT use at work would tend to weaken the effect of F2F intensity on WFH 
measures.  This correlation between F2F tasks and ICT use at work can also be observed within countries (see 
Figure A 1  in Appendix 2) . MEX ECU

 Figure 3  illustrates the importance of distinguishing between ICT use at work and the availability of an 
internet connection at home. While both variables are highly correlated —i.e. countries where peo ple use 
more ICT at work also have higher internet connectivity at home —there are some differences , particularly 
among less developed countries . For instance, Peru, Mexico and Ecuador are closer to the average with 
respect to ICT use at work, but are laggi ng more with respect to internet access at home. Accordingly, while 
the Philippines  ranks relatively high in terms of ICT use at work, it has relatively low  levels of internet 
connectivity at home  (Figure 3  (b)). Thereby, while  their jobs could be amenable to telecommuting based on a 
tasks approach, poor internet connectivity implies that many workers may not be able to do their jobs at 
home.  
  11

 (b) STEP surveys  
 
Note: The vertical axis measures the Low ICT use index ( a higher value means lower ICT use at work ), while the horizontal axis measures the Low 
ICT at home index ( a higher value means poorer internet access at home ). The variable to measure internet connectivity at home is not available for El 
Salvador, thereby we use a different approach for this country. We consider that households have internet access at home if they have a computer and 
fixed telephone access.  
 
When combining the four indexes, we find  substantial cross -country variation in the amenability  of jobs  to 
working from home . As seen in Figure 4 , the most vulnerable countries in the PIAAC sample are Turkey and 
those from the LAC region. In the STEP sampl e, countries from the ECA region have jobs more amenable 
to work ing from home , while the opposite is true for Sri Lanka, Lao  PDR , El Salvador and Ghana . In 
contrast to  Dingel & Neiman (2020a) , we find that the United States  ranks lower than most OECD countries 
in terms of its jobs’ amenability to working from home . Our findings are consistent with Hardy et al. (2018) , 
who use the PIAAC surveys and find that the United States  has more  jobs that are more manually intensive 
than most other countries .

 Figure 4 . WFH amenability index across countries.  
(a) PIAAC surveys  
 (b) STEP surveys  
 
Note: Each bar shows the number of standard deviations below/above the mean. A higher value indicates a greater amenability of jobs to working 
from home. The magnitude of the estimates is not comparable between the PIAAC and STEP datasets.  
 
The difference between our results and those of  Dingel & Neiman (2020a)  seem s to be driven by the fact 
that while the United States  has a higher share of jobs in occupations that are more amenable to work ing 
from home than other countries, the tasks associated with these occupations are different across countries 
and tend to be less favorable to working from home  in the United States .  Figure A 2  in Appendix 2  
illustrates this issue using Norway,  the United States  and Spain as examples. The United States  has 61 percent 
of its jobs in the four occupational categories that are more amena ble to WFH, a figure higher than for 
Norway (55 percent) and Spain (59 percent). If we imputed the  US WFH measures to each occupation of 
these other two countries (as in Dingel & Neiman, 2020a ), we would conclude that jobs are more amenable 
to WFH in the United States . However, when comparing the same occupations across countries, we find that 
most occupations in the United States  are less amenable to WFH than in Norway and Spain. For example , the 
US WFH index for technicians is far lower than that  for Norway and Spain. In other words, these findings  
illustrate the importance of using measures of tasks that vary across occupations and countries,  since 
occupations are not associated with the sa me tasks in different economies .  -0.8-0.6-0.4-0.200.20.40.6

 Our findings also shed light on the importance of using task measures that vary at the individual  level  instead 
of at the occupation level. A  simple decomposition shows that less than half of the variation in the WFH 
index  is explained by variation between 4 -digit ISCO occupations (see Table A 2  in the appendix). Most of 
the variation in  the tasks related to WFH takes place within narrowly defined occupations.  
The c orrelation between economic development and the  amenability  of jobs  to working from home is 
positive  within the PIAAC and STEP datasets . When we also consider the availability of internet access at 
home, the relative ranking of countries does not change significantly. That is, poorer countries have a lower  
share of jobs that are amenable  to be done at home  (Figure 5 ). For example , the Netherlands  is 0.38 standard 
deviations above the average PIAAC country in terms of its jobs’ amenability to working from home , while 
Ecuador and Turkey are 0.65  and 0. 5 standard deviations below the average , respectively . In the PIAAC 
sample, o ther countries whose jobs are also more amenable  to WFH are Belgium and  the Nordic countries . 
In contrast, Peru, Mexico , and Chile have jobs  that are more vulnerable  in this regard . The correlation 
between GDP per capita and the WFH measure is negative for the LMPS countries, as Jordan ranks higher in 
terms of WFH amenability despite having a lower level of GDP per capita. However, this may  be explained 
by Jordan having higher internet penetration than Egypt and Tunisia.6

3.2 Within -country findings  
There are large disparities  in terms of jobs’ amenability to working from home within countries.  Figure 6  
show s differences  with respect to the average worker  for the whole PIAAC, STEP and LMPS data  sets.7 
Across most countries, women are more likely to have jobs more amenable to WFH. This is beca use they are 
less likely to have jobs intensive  in physical /manual work than men. Educational attainment is strongly linked

 to WFH amenability, since college graduates in all 53 countries have jobs more amenable to WFH than their 
less educated peers.  
Older workers are less  likely to have jobs’ amenable to WFH in most countries, and this is  due to  a 
combination of counteracting forces. On the one hand,  the F2F intensity increases and ICT use declines with 
age, which tends to reduce older workers’ jobs a menability to WFH. On the other hand, the physical/manual 
intensity declines with age, making jobs of older workers more amenable to WFH. However, the latter is not 
strong enough to counteract the role of F2F and ICT  tasks for older workers . 
Self-employment is associated with lower amenability to WFH in most countries. Their jobs require more 
physical/manual intensity and require more F2F interaction. On the other hand, they are more likely to use ICT at work than salaried workers, but this fa ctor does not affect their WFH measure to a large exten t.   
Workers with a formal job —either because they have a contract (PIAAC) or social security contributions 
(STEP and LMPS) —are more likely to have jobs amenable to WFH than their informal counterparts . This is 
because informal workers have more physical/manual intensive jobs and lower ICT use at work. This is important because informal workers are less likely to be protected against important risks. For example, 
subsidies and other forms of assistance during the COVID- 19 crisis are easier to implement when using the 
social insurance infrastructure, which often only includes formal workers.

 Note: The vertical axis measures the WFH index adjusted by internet access at home, in standard deviations from the mean of the (A) PIAAC, (B) 
STEP and (C) LMPS samples.  A higher value indicates that jobs are more amenable to WFH.  
The sectors that emerge as more  amenable to WFH tend to be the same across most countries in the PIAAC 
and LMPS data sets. These sectors include ICT, professional services, the public sector , and finance (Figure 
7). In contrast, jobs in hotels and restaurants, agriculture, construction , and commerce are the least amenable 
to WFH.

Finally, we regress the WFH index for each data  set on individ ual and job characteristics and confirm that 
even after controlling for observable characteristics, women, college graduates and salaried workers are more 
likely to have jobs amenable to WFH than men, lower educated, and self -employed workers  (Table 3 ).8

 Differences in educational attainment predict large gaps in WFH measures: the jobs of college graduates are 
0.70 standard deviation more amenable to WFH than those of their less educated counterparts in the PIAAC  
sample. That figure for the MNA region is 0.61.  In all three samples, workers aged 25 and older have jobs less 
amenable to WFH than those 24 years or young er. In PIAAC countries, the relationship between amenability 
to WFH and age has an inverted U -shaped pattern, where those aged 25 to 34 years have the jobs most 
amenable to WFH, while those younger than 25 and older than 55 are at the opposite end.  Among c ountries 
in the STEP and LMPS data  sets, workers in the youngest age bracket have the jobs most amenable to WFH, 
but there are little differences by age among those aged 25 to 65.

4. Concluding Remarks  
This paper  provides new evidence on which countries and type s of workers have jobs  that are less amenable 
to working from home. Using data from 53 countries on the type s of tasks that each person does at work —as 
 
 19 
 opposed to occupation- level measures from the United States —it finds that poorer countries and workers 
who are male, with lower levels of education, self -employed , and with informal jobs are more vulnerable to 
social distancing policies , since the nature of their jobs make s them less amenable to working from home.  
These findings highlight the importance of income protection policies for w orkers who are not in the formal 
sector and thereby  are less likely to be reached by social protection programs channeled through formal 
mechanisms. At the same time, it highlights the importance of accelerating ICT adoption to facilitate home -
based work w hen working on- location is not an option. Finally, it shows that using individual information on 
the tasks that people do at work is important, since occupations capture only half or less of the type s of tasks 
that workers do on- the-job.

 Appendix  1. Measuring the amenability of jobs to working from home  
If data constraints did not exist, we argue that the probability that a job can  be done at home during the 
COVID -19 can be modeled as:  
Pr(𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 =1)=𝑊𝑊(𝑥𝑥,𝑧𝑧,𝜀𝜀)          
Where  𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊  is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the job cannot be done at home, and zero otherwise; 𝑥𝑥 and 𝑧𝑧  
are vectors of observable and unobservable variables summarizing characteristics of the job, and 𝜀𝜀 is a 
random term. The observable characteristics of the job may include the extent to which it requires special 
equipment, supervision of others, etc. Unobservable characteristics include whether the job is considered 
essential by local authorities, whether the employer can financially support remote operations, e tc. These 
variables can be summarized in a latent variable 𝑦𝑦∗: 
𝑦𝑦∗= 𝑥𝑥′𝛽𝛽+𝑧𝑧′𝛾𝛾+𝜀𝜀 
Where  
𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 =1 if 𝑦𝑦∗>0, 
𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 =0 if 𝑦𝑦∗≤0, 
The vectors of parameters 𝛽𝛽 and 𝛾𝛾  can be thought of as weights. For example, lifting heavy items at work 
may be a more importa nt factor to determine the probability to 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊  than having to repair equipment.  
If we observed 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊  during the COVID -19 crisis and had information on the job’s characteristics 𝑥𝑥 before 
the crisis, the vector of parameters 𝛽𝛽 could be estimated using a  standard binary choice model. However, 
since data on 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊  are not available, we only have data on 𝑥𝑥 to rank jobs by their likelihood to be done 
remotely. Thereby, we need to make assumptions about the values of the weights 𝛽𝛽.  
We construct four indice s that can be interpreted as latent variables for the probability of not working from 
home during COVID- 19: 
(1) Physical/Manual: 𝑃𝑃𝑊𝑊=𝑓𝑓(𝑝𝑝) 
(2) Face- to-face: 𝑊𝑊2𝑊𝑊=𝑓𝑓(𝑓𝑓) 
(3) Low ICT use at work: 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿  𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 =𝑓𝑓(𝑖𝑖𝐿𝐿) 
(4) Low ICT at home: 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿  𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 ℎ𝐿𝐿𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜=𝑓𝑓(𝑖𝑖ℎ) 
Where 𝑝𝑝 ,𝑓𝑓,𝑖𝑖𝐿𝐿 and 𝑖𝑖ℎ are vectors of tasks. The Physical/Manual index reflects  the fact that some jobs are 
intensive in tasks that are location- specific and cannot be performed remotely. Examples include low -skilled 22 
 jobs in mining, cleaning or in a capital -intensive manufacturing, middle -skilled jobs in equipment repairs, and 
high-skilled jobs that require specialized equipment such as in laboratory research. The F2F index measures 
the extent to which jobs require in -perso n interactions, that is those where the worker must be in the same 
place as his or her co -worker(s), supervisor, subordinate, customer, public or students.  
To distinguish between face -to-face interactions that must be carried out in -person as opposed to those that 
can be done remotely, we construct a third index to reflect the fact that some of these face -to-face 
interactions can be done using Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), i.e. the low ICT at work 
index. Finally, we create a fourth index  to capture the availability of an internet connection at home (low ICT 
at home index).  
The 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊  index is a combination of the physical /manual task index, the F2F index, the low ICT at work 
index and the low ICT at home index. The later captures the lack  of internet connectivity at home.  This is 
important since many workers may carry out activities that can be easily done at home, but the lack of 
connectivity could make it impossible.  
A limitation of the data is that ICT use increased dramatically since t he time that several of the surveys were 
collected. Assuming that the share of ICT users remained stable is not consistent with reality, since the share 
of internet users increased by about 65 percent in low and middle -income countries since 2012, the year  of 
the oldest survey of our dataset.9 Thereby, this is another reason for which is not possible to estimate the 
fraction of jobs that can be conducted currently using ICT. However, under the weaker assumption that the 
relative use of ICT across countries,  types of jobs or workers remained stable over time, we provide new 
insights on what type of workers and jobs are more vulnerable to social distancing measures.  
The components of each vector, for each dataset, are listed in Table A 1. We first standardize each variable 
within each vector with mean zero and variance one. We then proceed to sum up all the variables within each 
vector and normalize the sum again to have mea n zero and variance one. As mentioned above, each 
component within tasks receives the same weight. All four indexes are constructed so that higher values 
indicate a lower amenability to  WFH. For example, a higher value of the physical/manual index contribu tes 
to reduce the amenability  to WFH.  
Then, we proceed to estimate the WFH index using the standardize indexes PH, F2F, Low ICT work and 
Low ICT home. We multiply the sum of the four subindexes by - 1 so that a higher value of WFH indicates a 
higher amenabi lity to WFH. Each of these four components are also given equal weights. That is, an increase 
in one standard deviation in either of the four tasks measures has the same impact on the WFH index. All the 
 
9 According to data from the World Development Indicators (WDI), the share of internet users in low and middle 
income countries increased from 26 to 43 percentage points between 2010 and 2017 
(https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.NET.USER.ZS?locations=XO ).  23 
 standardizations are done within the PIAAC, STEP and LPMS datasets, by pooling the surveys for all the 
countries, to allow for cross -country comparisons.

Note: The vertical axis measures the share of jobs that can be done from home, following a methodology similar to Dingel & Neiman (2020a, 2020b) . 
We restrict the set of task variables to those closer to the ones used by Dingel & Neiman (2020b) . For the PIAAC sample, we define a job as unable to 
be done from home if at least one of the follow ing conditions is met: (i) the job requires working physically for a long period at least once a week, (ii) 
the frequency of email use is less than once a month, (iii) the job involves selling products or services at least once a wee k. Using this definitio n, we 
obtained values very close to those reported by Dingel & Neiman (2020a)  in Figure 2. For the STEP sample, we use the calculations obtained by Saltiel 
(2020).  MEX ECUPERA…BEL
