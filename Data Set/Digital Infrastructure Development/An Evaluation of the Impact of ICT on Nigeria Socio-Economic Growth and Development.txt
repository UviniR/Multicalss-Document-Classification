Abstract 
Successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SIL AR) process was used for the deposition of 
cadmium sulphide quantum dot on mesoporous TiO 2 film. The change in colour of the TiO 2 film 
from white to deep orange was the primary indicator  of the growth of CdS quantum dot on the 
film. The UV-vis spectroscopy result confirmed both  the presence and quantum confinement 
effect of CdS on TiO 2. The absorption spectra showed that the sensitized  film absorbs radiation 
at higher wavelength with the peak at 410nm. A band  gap of 2.46ev was obtained for the CdS 
sensitized TiO 2. 
Keywords: Quantum Dot, Thin Films, SILAR, CdS, TiO 2 
 
 
 
Introduction 
     When a solid exhibits a distinct variation of 
optical and electronic properties with a 
variation of particle size ˂ 100nm, it can be 
called a nanostructure and is categorized as 1) 
two dimensional e.g. thin films or quantum 
wells 2) one dimensional e.g. quantum wires 
or 3) zero dimensional or dots. During the last 
decades, a great deal of attention has been 
focused on the opto-electronic properties of 
nanostructured semiconductors or quantum 
dots as many fundamental properties are size 
dependent in the nanometer range. [1] 
Among various kinds of II-VI compound 
semiconductors, CdS is widely studied due to 
the band energy (2.4ev) existing in the visible 
region[2] which is suitable for photovoltaic 
cells[3] and light emitting diode[4]. A 
significant amount of current research is 
aimed at using the unique optical properties of 
quantum dots in devices such as LED, solar 
cells and biological marker. However, the use 
of the quantum dot properties requires 
sufficient control during synthesis because 
their intrinsic properties are determined by 
different factors such as size, impurities, 
shape, defect and crystallinity. Substantive 
efforts have been made in the last decade to 
synthesize CdS thin films by several methods 
such as electrochemical synthesis[5], 
chemicalbathdeposition[6]solvothermal 
route[7],chemical vapour deposition[8], spray 
pyrolysis[9] etc. The methods of preparation of CDS also have significant impact on the 
thickness, particle size which is important for 
photo catalytic applications. CdS is an 
interesting material for quantum dots because 
it is a direct band gap semiconductor with 
band gap of 2.42eV. By tailoring its 
composition and size, or surface functionality, 
it is possible to enhance luminescence 
emission and quantum yield of the quantum 
dots. [10] 
In the present work, a chemical dipping 
technique has been utilized to synthesize the 
Cadmium sulphide quantum dot. The 
technique is referred to as successive ionic 
layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) which 
is a step-wise process of chemical deposition. 
SILAR is generally reported for preparation of 
thin films of cadmium sulphide[11] and other 
compound semiconductor. It is a unique 
method in which thin films of compound 
semiconductor can be deposited by alternate 
dipping of a substrate into separately placed 
aqueous cationic and anionic precursors. 
Between every immersion the substrate is 
rinsed in water. This method provides the 
control of the film thickness at atomic level. 
 
Materials & Methods 
All reagents used for the synthesis of 
cadmium sulphide quantum dot were of 
analytical grade and were used without further 
purification.  ` 
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018          5 Materials: Titanium oxide (TiO 2) from 
Solaronix, Cadmium acetate from BDH 
reagent, aqueous ammonia, ethanol, aqueous 
polysulphide, substrates and distilled water. 
Preparation of TiO 2Thin Film: The TiO 2 was 
screen printed on the substrate and annealed at 
450oC for about 40mins, after which it was 
allowed to cool gradually. 
Cationic Precursor: The cationic precursor 
was prepared by putting 0.1M of Cadmium 
acetate in a 100ml beaker to which 40ml of 
distilled water was added followed by a 
gradual addition of 10ml of aqueous ammonia. 
Then 50ml of absolute ethanol was also 
gradually added to the solutionresulting in the 
formation of precipitates. 
Synthesis of CdS Quantum Dot: The TiO2 
film was dipped first in the cationic precursor 
for 20seconds, retracted and rinsed properly in 
distilled water for 20secs, dipped in the 
anionic precursor for 20secs and rinsed again 
for 20sec. This whole process completes one 
cycle of cadmium sulphide quantum dot 
deposition. The procedure was repeated for 
6cycles at the end of which the CdS quantum 
dot was rinsed thoroughly, allowed to air dry 
and annealed at 150oC. The deposition time 
was fixed at 80sec for each cycle. 
 
Results & Discussion  
In the process of depositing the CdSquantum 
dot, the primary indicator of the successful 
deposition was the film colour change. At the 
end of the first cycle, the TiO 2 film colour 
changed from white to light yellow indicating sparse deposition of the cds quantum dot. As 
the SILAR cycle increased, the colourchanged 
to deep orange. 
The UV-visible absorption spectra of the CdS 
quantum dot were obtained with a UV-vis 
spectrophotometer Axiom UV752 in the range 
of 400nm-1000nm. TiO 2 film absorbs only in 
the ultraviolet range, (λ˂375nm)[12]. Fig 1 
presents the UV-visible absorption spectra of 
the CdS sensitized TiO 2. It indicates that 
sensitized film exhibits an absorbance at 
wavelengths higher than 400nm with the 
highest absorbance value at 410nm 
wavelength.  
The absorbance of the CdS sensitized TiO 2 
film at higher wavelength of 400nm and above 
confirms the growth of the CdS quantum dot 
(M.Ghazzalet.al.,2014). The value of the 
absorption coefficient is dependent upon the 
radiation energy as well as the composition of 
films. The band gap energy (Eg) was derived 
from the mathematical treatment of the data 
obtained from the absorbance vs wavelength 
with the following relation; 
 
Where α is the absorption coefficient,hν is the 
photon energy, A is a function of refractive 
index and electron/hole effective masses and n 
is a constant depending on whether the 
material has direct or indirect band gap. The 
band gap was determined by extrapolating the 
straight line to base line where the value 
(αhν)2 is zero in the plot of (αhν)2  against hν 
as presented in Fig 2.

Figure 2: Absorption coefficient of the CdS  
 
The band gap of TiO 2 is 3.2eV which is larger 
than that of bulk CdS with band gap 2.42eV. 
However, the CdS sensitized TiO 2 film has 
band gap of 2.46ev as deduced from fig 2. 
This reduction in band gap of the CdS/TiO 2 is as a result of the absorbance of the film being 
redshifted to 410nm with increased deposition 
of CdS quantum dot. The 2.46eV band gap of 
the CdS/TiO 2 for 6cycles is consistent with the 
results of M. Ghazzal et al., 2014 for 7cycles. 
 
Conclusion  
The SILAR technique is the commonest 
technique for quantum dot deposition as it 
allows for control of dot size. The TiO 2 film 
was coated with tiny particles of CdS quantum 
dot whose size increased with the deposition 
cycle. The presence of the dot on TiO 2 was confirmed by the absorbance spectra response 
of the CdS sensitized TiO 2 and the reduced 
band gap from 3.0ev to 2.4ev. The absorption 
onset was at 410nm which is above the UV 
range within which the TiO 2 can absorb light.

Abstract 
 
As organizations grow, the need to manage the networ k grows. This work studies the activity of a 
network, how they can be monitored to avoid corpora te fraud, which is a type of fraud that is 
common to financial institutions most especially. P rotecting your organization from advanced 
threats, compliance violations and operational issu es is an ongoing process. It requires broad 
visibility, continuous monitoring, intelligent coun termeasure capabilities, and ongoing 
adaptation to new and evolving issues and threats. A key component of that process is having the 
extended visibility to correlate what’s happening a t the host level to event data throughout the 
network. This paper delivers extended visibility an d protection via fully integrated Activity 
Monitoring and presents an image capturing sensor n etwork for intrusive observations in the 
network and show the potential of generative hidden  Markov model and discriminative 
conditional models in activity recognition . 
 
 
1. Introduction 
Attacks on computer by outside intruder are 
more publicized but the ones perpetrated by 
insiders are very common and often more 
damaging. Insiders represent the greatest 
threat to computer security because they 
understand their organization’s business and 
how their computer systems work. They have 
both the confidentiality and access to perform 
these attacks. An inside attack will have a 
higher probability of successfully breaking 
into the system and extracting critical 
information. The insiders also represent the 
greatest challenge to securing the company 
network because they have authorized level of 
access to the file system. 
In a quest for maximum profitability in a 
network, there is need to monitor the activities 
performed such that the network activity in a 
real time would be tracked, confidential 
information safeguarded and control over the 
daily activities of every staff established.  
Activity monitoring system is used to detect 
inside threats by monitoring file access and process activity [1]. It is a powerful tool that 
allows one to track any local area network [1], 
giving you the most detailed information on 
when, how and what your network users do on 
daily basis. If it is a library public network, 
university or commercial organization 
network, Activity Monitor offers efficient 
control.  
Activity monitoring system has become one of 
the vital tools in providing evidence in cases 
such as computer misuse and fraud. 
Computers and other devices are being used 
increasingly to commit, enable or support 
unwanted activity perpetrated against 
individuals, organizations or assets. Although 
it is most often associated with the 
investigation of a wide variety of computer 
crime, network activity monitoring system 
may also be used in civil proceedings [2]. The 
discipline involves similar techniques and 
principles to data recovery and a lot of 
information is retained on the computer than 
most people realize. It’s also more difficult to ` 
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018          8 completely remove information than it is 
generally thought. For these reasons (and 
many more), Activity monitoring system can 
often find evidence or even completely 
recover lost or deleted information, even if the 
information was intentionally deleted. 
The work in this paper consist of two tier 
application – server and client whereby the 
activity monitoring server can be installed in 
any computer in the entire local area network 
and the client which is the remote spy 
software is installed on all the computers on 
the network to be monitored. 
 
2.General Review and Problem Definition 
The failure of statutory audit to prevent and 
reduce mis-appropriation of corporate fund 
and an increase in corporate crime has put 
pressure on organizations, schools, banks and 
other firms that make maximum use of 
computer network. 
 
Independent Process Monitor 
Problem 
Enterprise IT systems have a constant flow of 
processes starting and stopping, but they are 
inconsistently logged. This makes detecting 
individual events, such as critical processes 
restarting properly after routine maintenance, 
challenging without an independent record of 
the event. 
 
Network Connection Monitor 
Problem 
Access to host-level detail surrounding 
network behaviour is a critical component of 
real time monitoring and forensic analysis. 
This can be difficult in an enterprise 
environment due to a lack of connection-
specific log data or limited access to flow 
data. 
 
Data Loss Defender 
Problem 
Many advanced threats that result in data 
breaches employ physical means of 
transferring information using removable 
media sources such as UDB thumb drives and 
CD/DVD-RW devices to remove sensitive 
data from the network. Windows Registry Monitor 
Problem 
Changes to the Windows Registry are not 
natively logged, making it difficult for 
organizations to detect changes to the registry, 
including the addition of malicious software. 
Once embedded in the registry, malware can 
easily propagate by controlling processes, 
downloading payloads, and infecting 
additional systems. 
 
User Activity Monitor 
Problem 
Knowing who is logged into a particular host 
when malicious activity or a critical 
operations failure happens is a key component 
to comprehensive understanding of a specific 
event. 
 
Detecting Insider Threats by Monitoring 
System Call Activity  
[3] analyzed the detection of inside threats by 
monitoring system call activities. They 
analysed there results using system call traces 
to see if it is possible to detect insider threats 
by monitoring file access and process activity, 
raw data are looked at in a different manner: 
the relationships between users and files, users 
and processes, and processes and files. By 
analysing these models and relationships, they 
want to learn whether it is possible to build an 
effective insider threat detection system for 
each of these relationships. If any of the 
models do not work, they want to discover the 
reasons and all technical difficulties behind 
the problem. Furthermore, they want to 
discover any characteristics or promising 
approaches that can help to build good profiles 
for users and processes. As a proof of concept, 
they implemented a small detection system 
that use one of these profiles to detect a large 
set of buffer-overflow attacks.  
To analyse file access and process execution, 
they has a log of system activity,  they already 
had a large database of system call traces, 
collected for the project using software 
developed for Seer. The traces were collected 
from ten machines with twenty users over two 
years. Their approach for analysing file access 
was to develop patterns for two models: user-` 
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018          9 oriented and process oriented. When analysing 
patterns for each user, the authors decided to 
categorize the users into two sets: system 
users and normal users.  
At the end of the result, the authors where able 
to design a system that detects insider 
misbehaviour, monitor system call activity 
and watch for danger signs or unusual 
behaviour. The authors describe an 
experimental system designed to test this 
approach. They tested the system’s ability to 
detect common insider misbehaviour by 
examining file system and process-related 
system calls management.The basic problems 
and weaknesses confronting the paper was the 
modes in which they monitor the activities on 
the network with dates only with regards to 
memory efficient, the speed of processing and 
the organization of logs in the server system. 
 
3. Notation 
The time series data obtained from the activity 
are divided in time slices of constant length 
∆t. We denote an activity reading for time t as 
xit, indicating whether activity i fired at least 
once between time t and time t+∆t, with 
xit∈{0,1} . In an organization with N 
computers installed, we define a binary 
observation vector xt=(x1t,x2t,…,xNt)T. An 
activity at time slice t is denoted by yt with 
yt∈{1… K}, therefore, the recognition task is 
to find a sequence of labels 
y1:T={y1,y2,…, yT} that best explains the 
sequence of observations 
x1:T={x1,x2,…, xT}for a total of T time steps. 
 
3.1 Hidden Markov model 
The hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a 
generative probabilistic model consisting of a 
hidden variable y and an observable variable x 
at each time step. In our case the hidden 
variable is the activity performed, and the observable variable is the vector of image 
capture. Generative models provide an explicit 
representation of dependencies by specifying 
the factorization of the joint probability of the 
hidden and observable variables p(y1:T, x1:T). 
In the case of HMMs there are two 
dependency assumptions that define this 
model. 
• The hidden variable at time t, namely 
yt, depends only on the previous hidden 
variable yt−1 (Markov assumption  [4]). 
• The observable variable at time t, 
namely xt, depends only on the hidden 
variable yt at that time slice. 
The joint probability therefore factorizes as 
follows 
 
p(y1:T,x1:T)=p(y1)p(x1|y1)∏t=2Tp(yt|yt−1)p(
xt|yt).(1) 
 
The different factors further specify the 
workings of the model. The initial state 
distribution p(y1) is a probability table with 
individual values denoted as follows 
 
p(y1=i)≡πi.(2) 
 
The observation distribution p(xt|yt) indicating 
the probability that the state yt would generate 
observation x_t. In our case each activity 
capturing is modelled as an independent 
Bernoulli distribution, giving 
 
p(xt|yt)=∏n=1Np(xnt|yt)  (3) 
p(xnt=v|yt=i)=(µin)v(1−µin)1−v. (4) 
 
The transition probability distribution p(yt|yt−1) 
represents the probability of going from one 
state to the next. This is given by a conditional 
probability table where individual transition 
probabilities are denoted as follows: 
 
p(yt=j|yt−1=i)≡aij.(5) 
 
Our HMM is therefore fully specified by the 
following parameters A = {aij}, B = {µ in} and  
π = {πi}. The parameters are learned from 
training data using maximum likelihood. This 
is done for each user separately. Using these 
parameters we can find the sequence of ` 
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018          10 activities performed by various users in 
organizations. This is done by calculating 
p(y1:T|x1:T), which can be easily calculated 
from the joint probability [5].  
 
4. Activity Monitoring System  
Correlating network-wide event data with 
activities occurring at the client level is often 
hindered by the fact that critical client-based 
activities may not be consistently logged, 
often requiring multiple solutions to fill in the 
information gaps. Activity Monitoring 
provides independent awareness and insight 
into what’s happening on client systems, 
providing a critical layer of protection from a 
broad spectrum of problems, ranging from 
important operational events such as system 
and application failures to security and 
compliance violations tied to unauthorized or 
malicious activity. Centrally monitored and 
managed as a fully integrated component of 
the Activity Monitoring includes: 
Independent Process Monitor 
Detects and records process and service 
activity that may not otherwise be reported. 
This can identify and alert on important 
behavior such as clients running blacklisted 
processes (such as peer-to-peer clients), 
critical processes stopping or any non-
approved process starting up. 
 
Windows Registry Monitor 
Monitors the Windows Registry for additions, 
modifications, deletions, permission changes, 
and ownership changes. This visibility 
provides greater insight into changes or 
manipulations of Windows operating systems, 
including the addition of new startup 
processes, to detect advanced threats and 
compromised client systems. 
 
Network Connection Monitor 
Independently records network connection 
activity to and from the client systems, 
providing a detailed, independent log of all 
network connections opened and closed on a 
client system. It detects and alarms on critical 
events such as unauthorized web or FTP 
servers. 
 Data Loss Defender 
Monitors and prevents data transfers to and 
from removable media such as CD/DVD-RW 
devices and USB drives. Data Loss Defender 
logs, alerts on, and audits all data transfers to 
removable media ports and can optionally 
block transfers on selected machines and 
devices. 
 
Clients Activity Monitoring 
Logs any user or process that authenticates to 
the server, This independently records an audit 
trial that can be used to either supplement 
local auditing systems or to validate that 
system logs have not been modified on the 
server. 
Activity Monitoring combined with 
comprehensive Security Intelligence Platform 
provides tremendous visibility into what’s 
going on where, and when it happens 
throughout the IT Environment.  
This work can independently  
i. Detect and alert whenever a blacklisted 
process starts or when a critical process stops 
or fails to restart following a specific event, 
such as a reboot. 
ii. Creates an independent log of every 
network connection on a monitored client 
system, including relevant detail such as ID 
port, communication direction and the process 
that opened the connection. 
iii. Detect the use of removable media 
directly on the client, generating an alarm 
before data can be transferred either to or from 
a removable media device. 
iv. log who is logged in and for how long, 
correlating user audit activity with other log 
and event data, creating a comprehensive audit 
of user behavior throughout the IT 
environment. 
v. Monitor the Windows Registry to 
detect changes, including the introduction of 
malicious software and new startup processes. 
 
By harnessing the power of Smart Response, 
this paper can provide extensive, active 
protection at the client level from advanced 
threats, compliance violations, and operational 
issues. The smart response can also; ` 
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018          11 i. Restart individual processes, pulling all 
relevant information, such asthe process name 
and impacted host, directly from the alarm. 
ii. Be configured to automatically close an 
unauthorized port or shut down a suspicious 
network connection in response to any alarm. 
iii. With the help of Data Loss Defender can 
automatically prevent data from being 
transferred to or from removable media 
directly on the host, by immediately ejecting 
the device, for real time protection 
iv. Remove from a network unauthorized users or 
those who engage in suspicious or detrimental 
behavior – either with or without requiring 
authorization before taking action. v. Work when changes to the Windows Registry 
are detected, an alarm is triggered alerting IT 
and security personnel to the activity. If the 
change is determined to be malicious, 
administrators can approve a 
SmartResponseplug-in that automatically 
disables the startup processes to prevent the 
spread of Malware.

Abstract 
 
This paper presents the concept of unauthorized acc ess through equipment hardware termed 
“Hardware backdoor”, which is the act of remotely g aining access to a computerized equipment by 
planting a device that gives remote access to unaut horized persons. The objective of this work is to 
analyze the hexadecimal codes in the microcontrolle r of a newly procured equipment and verify that it 
operates at expected frequency. I was motivated by the recent discovery of remote access in United 
States Military grade equipment purchased from Chin a,  which enable the later perform e-espionage 
activities on countries using their equipments. The  methodology adopted is Prototyping, in which the 
Proteus Simulation software will be used to simulat e the behavior of the hexadecimal codes in the 
microcontrollers, extracted using hardware programm er. The expected result will be a digital 
oscilloscope displayed frequency that either shows similarity or not to the stored expected frequency.  
Keywords: Microcontrollers, Microcontroller Based B ackdoor, Hardware Backdoor 
 
1.0 Introduction 
    Boko Haram conducted its operations more or 
less peacefully during the first seven years of its  
existence. That changed in 2009 when the 
Nigerian government launched an investigation 
into the group's activities following reports that its 
members were arming themselves. When the 
government came into action, several members of 
the group were arrested in Bauchi , sparking 
deadly clashes with Nigerian security forces 
which led to the deaths of an estimated 700 people 
[1]. During the fighting with the security forces 
Boko Haram fighters reportedly "used fuel-laden 
motorcycles" and "bows with poison arrows" to 
attack a police station. The group's founder and 
then leader Mohammed Yusuf was also killed 
during this time while still in police custody. Aft er 
Yusuf's killing, Abubakar Shekau  became the 
leader and held this position in January 2015.[5] 
The unending war with terrorist group Boko 
Haram is a major cause for concern in Nigeria. 
Since 2009, the group has launched terrorist 
attacks on worship centers, schools, etc. The 
inability of Nigerian Military to bring a final end  
to the operations of this group prompted quest 
into what the Nigerian Army could be doing 
wrong.  
    Then an eye opener came through researchers 
CambridgeUniversity computing Laboratory. In 
his report, Cambridge researcher Sergei 
Storobogatov wrote that a microchip used by US 
military and manufactured by China contain a 
secret “backdoor” that it is “wide open” intellectual property theft, fraud, reverse 
engineering of the chip to allow introduction of 
Trojan.[2] 
     The problem therefore is: 
1.Computer manufacturers such as China embed 
hardware-backdoors on non-volatile memory in 
chips like BIOS on PCs or in firmware of routers, 
and export these to target nations for sale at chea p 
prices: 
The threat posed by this discovery is lethal for th e 
following reasons 
    Military:     Nigeria’s war against the terrori st 
group “Boko Haram” could have lingered as a 
result of backdoors in military surveillance 
systems, compromised PCs and phones of top 
military officer, or a compromised network, and 
computerized equipment microcontrollers 
containing codes which carry out more functions 
than meet the eye, resulting in incessant siege 
laying  and killing of Nigerian soldiers. 
 
2.0 Literature Review 
     This review looks at the role computerized 
military combat and combat services equipment 
play in giving away its owners. A look of the 
Microcontroller: 
    A microcontroller  (or MCU  for 
microcontroller unit ) is a small computer  on a 
single integrated circuit . In modern terminology, 
it is a System on a chip  or SoC. A microcontroller 
contains one or more CPUs  (processor cores) 
along with memory and programmable ` 
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018          15 input/output  peripherals. Program memory in the 
form of Ferroelectric RAM , NOR flash  or OTP 
ROM  is also often included on chip, as well as a 
small amount of RAM . Microcontrollers are 
designed for embedded applications, in contrast to 
the microprocessors  used in personal computers  
or other general purpose applications consisting of  
various discrete chips.  
    Microcontrollers are used in automatically 
controlled products and devices, such as 
automobile engine control systems, implantable 
medical devices, remote controls, office 
machines, appliances, power tools, toys and other 
embedded systems . By reducing the size and cost 
compared to a design that uses a separate 
microprocessor, memory, and input/output 
devices, microcontrollers make it economical to 
digitally control even more devices and processes. 
Mixed signal  microcontrollers are common, 
integrating analog components needed to control 
non-digital electronic systems. 
     Some microcontrollers may use four-bit words  
and operate at frequencies as low as 4 kHz, for 
low power consumption (single-digit milliwatts or 
microwatts). They will generally have the ability 
to retain functionality while waiting for an event 
such as a button press or other interrupt; power 
consumption while sleeping (CPU clock and most 
peripherals off) may be just nanowatts, making 
many of them well suited for long lasting battery 
applications. Other microcontrollers may serve 
performance-critical roles, where they may need 
to act more like a digital signal processor  (DSP), 
with higher clock speeds and power 
consumption.[3][4]

Probe:  This provides DC source of 5v. 5v is used 
because all digital ICs accept maximum of 5v and 
a minimum of 2.2 which is only used to save 
power.  
 
Microcontroller: Fig 3.2 showsPIC16F887 
which is a medium grade microcontroller.The 
microcontroller is a small and low-cost 
microcomputer, which is designed to perform the 
specific tasks of embedded systems like 
displaying information, receiving remote signals, 
etc. The general microcontroller consists of the 
processor, the memory (RAM, ROM, EPROM), 
Serial ports, peripherals (timers, counters), etc. 
Amplifying and Switching Circuit: The 
transistor, ZTX321 is a bipolar- junction-
transistor (BJT) used for amplifying signal output 
by the microcontroller. Microcontroller feeds 
signal into the base of RF transistors. The 
collector is the +ve lead that carries the amplifie d 
output to the tank circuit while the emitter is 
common to both. Emitter is the –ve lead that 
increases linearity and stability.               
This amplifier ensures signal from microcontroller 
is increased and that sufficient signal is supplied  
to the tank circuit.   
 
Tank Circuit: Circuit diagram of the capacitor 
and inductor in parallel form tune circuit or tank 
circuit. The function of the capacitor is to 
temporarily store signal and convert electrical 
signal into electromagnetic signal which will be 
radiated out. The indicator is an LED(Light 
Emitting Diode) with the function of giving 
indication that the system is on. 
Resistor R1 limits current going into the LED.  
Resistor R2 divides the current between the base, 
the collector and the emitter.

Multiplexer and Analog/Digital Converter:  
Converts the analog signal into a digital form. The  
output from the multiplexer is transferred to the 
hardware interface. 
Hardware Interface: fig 3. 1 show the chip 
programmer. The power supply of the Silicon 
from DUT (Device Under test) is the hardware 
interface (the programmer). Each microcontroller 
has its embedded code produced in the hardware 
interface. The hardware interface receives the 
output from the multiplexer and sends it to PC 
which is the user interface. 
PC This is the user interface through which 
hardware interface (programmer) communicates 
between microcontroller and user. 
Methodology 
     The Prototyping methodology used for this 
work is in two phases. First, the hardware 
programmer is used to read and store codes inside 
the microcontroller  received from the equipment manufacturer, that shows the expected 
hexadecimal code as well as read the hexadecimal 
code of the microcontroller  a newly procured 
equipment and these hexadecimal codes are stored 
in a directory with different names. Next the 
Proteus Simulation software is used to draw a 
schematic diagram of Microcontroller. The design 
is a simulation of the commands output by a 
microcontroller embedded in military grade 
computerized equipment such as the T72 and T70 
and analysis of simulation result by comparing its 
frequency based on signal-to-noise ration to a 
previous expected behavior. Disparity in expected 
outcome leads to further probe through the use of 
disassemble which converts the extracted machine 
code to human readable assembly language so as 
to investigate embedded code for hardware 
backdoor. A microcontroller (DUT) is connected 
to hardware programmer which has been 
previously installed to its user interface (PC). Th e 
programmer environment enables you select the 
chip you are working with if you have universal 
programmer) but if it is customized for only a 
particular chip, then that chip must be used. 
Available microcontrollers include 
PIC(Programmable Interrupt Circuit), Atmel, 
FPGA etc.

Experiment Explanation 
      Using the programmer IDE, a series of 
hexadecimal files can be extracted which form 
input into simulator. The simulator has a probe 
with DC source of 5v. 5v is used because all 
digital ICs accept maximum of 5v and a minimum 
of 2.2 which is only used to save power.  
     The microcontroller used for simulation is a 
medium grade (16F887) which is one of the latest 
products from Microchip. “F” added to the range 
“16” signifies it is of flash type which means its 
content can be erased and chip reprogrammed. 
The chip is a 40 pin, low price, high quality and 
easily available IC that operates between 0 -
20MHz with internal oscillator frequency range of 
8-31MHz.  
The transistor ZTX321 used in the simulation is a 
bipolar transistor. The choice of the transistor is  
because chosen design is a radio design that can 
detect and transmit waveform frequency. 
     The capacitor used is ceramic capacitor. 
Schematic diagram of capacitor and inductor in 
parallel form tune circuit or tank circuit. The 
function of the capacitor is to convert electrical 
signal into electromagnetic signal which will be 
radiated out. The indicator is an LED (Light 
Emitting Diode) with the function of giving 
indication that the system is on. 
Resistor R1 limits current going into the LED.  
Resistor R2 divides the current between the base, 
the collector and the emitter.      Current flows from RC2 into the base of the 
Transistor Q3. This transistor receives signal 
through its base, outputs it through the collector 
(upper part) while the emitter (the lower part 
earths the transistor). Any of the two transistor 
types can be used (NPN or PNP) The function of 
the transistor is to amplify and switch. The initia l 
current flowing from R2 will not be sufficient to 
power the tank circuit, hence it is fed into 
transistor ZTX321 which amplifies the current 
and switches to R3 through the collector, until the  
tank circuit is fed. At tank circuit electrical sig nal 
is then converted to electromagnetic signal that is  
radiated out in waveform. The frequency of the 
waveform represents the signal to noise ration that  
is evaluated and compared to previously stored 
data. If there is disparity when frequency is 
compared, further analysis is initialized by 
decompiling hexadecimal output from the MIC 
into human readable assembly language. Analysis 
for different test if suspicious is followed by cod e 
investigation.  
     The simulation procedure involves right 
clicking on the schematic, selecting edit, selectin g 
hex file of       Device Under Test, check if the 
frequency displayed by the digital oscilloscope is 
the same as that displayed   by the hex file from 
the microcontroller with expected behavior

Result Description 
    The experiment involves the reading of codes em bedded in microcontrollers of particular equipment.  
One of which is accepted as functional and has pass ed security evaluation test is used to compare to t he 
codes embedded in subsequently purchased equipment microcontrollers. These 
equipment/microcontrollers carry out the same funct ion at face value, however, the hexadecimal codes 
embedded are not the same. Also when these codes ar e simulated using the Proteus simulated, a 
frequency disparity is noticed. Figures 3.2 and 3.3  show frequencies of the hexadecimal codes 
simulated using the Proteus software.  
 
Summary 
    This paper x-rayed the role of Microcontrollers  in computerized equipment and how different 
microcontrollers operate at different frequencies, depending on the level of functions they are built to 
perform. It also showed that microcontrollers could  be embedded with hardware backdoors and still 
possess produce expected behavior. if the frequency  is not as expected, then a remote activity could b e 
going on.  
    It also showed the insecurity of computerized s urveillance equipment procured from unreliable 
sources, as the medium where they operate such as f ree space, is vulnerable to attack by their target 
enemy.  
 
Conclusion 
    Scanning of a Field Programmable Gate Array chi ps in equipments procured by the Nigerian Military 
brings to the fore the need to be security consciou s with respect to combat and combat service 
equipments. The procurement of computerized weapons  with all of its advantages over the enemy can 
have adverse effect if not monitored with utmost ca ution. 
Procurement policy presently practiced by Nigerian Army ensures availability without security 
considerations. Hence the overall system cannot be s aid to be dependable. 
  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 22  
 We conclude that simulation of frequencies of hex f iles embedded in microcontrollers of with the same 
grade and function reveal disparity or similarity o f the MCU functions. 
 
Recommendation 
1. Hardware backdoors are set to be triggered durin g functional tests of new equipment hence 
Microcontroller of procured equipment should be teste d even before performance tests. 
2. The engineering section of the Nigerian army sho uld be equipped with specified software and 
hardware required to carry out the device single or  chain scanning.  
3. Devices/equipment that fails the hardware securi ty assurance test must not be put to use until 
compromised parts are replaced. 
4. Computerized military grade equipment with huge advantage of being capable of detecting the 
enemy must be scanned for backdoor and Trojan and m ust pass both performance and security 
assurance tests so that it will not provide remote a ccess for the target.

Abstract 
 
As organizations acquire Big Data management system s there is still the need to keep the database 
management systems to fulfill their critical roles.  Integrating these two environments in an open and 
generic manner is therefore pertinent and needed.  There are current attempts aimed at integrating Big  
Data platforms (BDP) with database management syste ms (DBMS). However, these integration 
approaches are mainly proprietory or vendor specifi c. This research aimed to explore a non proprietory  
and open approach to integrating these two paradigm s: BDP and DBMS. A generic and open-source 
web based software for integrating BDP with DBMSref erred to in this paper as GemSoftwas created. 
GemSoftenabled movement of data from the DBMS to th e BDP and vice versa.GemSoftenables the 
visualization of data graphically. The software was  tested withMySQL and PostgreSQL against 
Hadoop. It can be used with other database, retriev ing data from the database, move data from the 
DBMS to the BDP , move data from the BDP to the DBMS , and allow visualization of the data 
graphically. This research attempts to bridge the g ap between BDP and DBMS. The research will 
benefitdata providers and organizations to diversify  their data management systems in an open manner.

1 Introduction
Gooddecisions require good information that is 
derived from raw facts such as data. Data is 
managed efficiently when stored in a database and 
the ultimate purpose of all business information 
systems is to help businesses use information as 
an organizational resource [11]. At the heart of al l 
these database management systems are the 
collection, storage, aggregation, manipulation, 
dissemination and management of data [1] [2]. 
Though data source can be searched, the 
challenge today is how companies can make sense 
of the intersection of these different types of dat a 
[1] [3].  
Big data allows organizations to gather, store, 
manage and manipulate vast amounts of data at 
the right speed, at the right time, and to gain the  
right insights [4] [2]. Big data is any kind of dat a 
source that has these characteristics; high volume,  
high velocity, high variety, low veracity and high 
value [1][2][3][4].Therefore as organizations gather a huge amount of data from their day to 
day activities, in instances where they want to 
migrate their data from the  platform to the big 
data platform due to its increasing volume, they 
need efficient data transfer systems [11]. The 
systems around allow file transfer of data to the 
big data platform, but in instances where the data 
you wish to transfer is seated in a  database, it 
becomes a long process and existing systems 
which allow database transfer directly to the big 
data platform are mainly support vendor specifia 
commercial dtabase such as Oracle database. This 
therefore motivated the research presented in this 
paper. The research seeks to explore the 
possibility of solving this problem by building a 
generic and open source software that allows 
transfer of database from the database 
management system. 
New stages of data management has to build on 
their predecessors. Data management has to  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 29  
 include technology advances in hardware, storage, 
networking and computing models such as 
virtualization and cloud computing. Data is 
managed efficiently when stored in a database and 
the ultimate purpose of all business information 
systems is to help businesses use information as 
an organizational resource. 
The goal of this project is to enable integration 
between Big Data Platform and DBMS. The 
objectives were: 1. To create a connection to any 
database from the software to the database 
management system. 2. To create a mechanism to 
move data from the database to the big data 
platform. 3. To create a mechanism to move data 
from the big data platform to the database 
management system. 4. To create a user 
component to view data in the form of graphs. 5. 
To create a generic software. 6. To create an open 
source software for database administrators. 
Data management has to include technology 
advances in hardware, storage, networking and 
computing models such as virtualization and 
cloud computing. Data is managed efficiently 
when stored in a database and the ultimate 
purpose of all business information systems is to 
help businesses use information as an 
organizational resource.  
 Before the 1970s the basic data storage was 
used to store data and as data grew in volume, 
there was the need for systems that could meet the 
growing data needs and as such relational 
databases were used for such purposes. This data 
in relational databases are stored into single hard  
disk. Such types of storage system fail when data 
grows in volume and velocity. These systems 
should be able to compute and analyze huge 
amount of data in parallel. Using single processor,  
it is difficult for doing this or it takes longer t han 
days unless the storage and processing capacities 
are increased by many factors [11].  
However in the 2000s and beyond, the rate of 
data growth has not only grown exponentially but 
also the data occur in various types and come in at  
an increasing velocity. This kind of data is 
referred to as the big data and the platform which 
supports such a system is the big data platform. 
Instead of increasing storage and processing 
capacities in general data processing systems, a 
distributed technology has been emerged. This technology is known as Hadoop [13] [7], a 
distributed storage and processing of very large 
amount of datasets across clusters of commodity 
hardware. Considering the storage and processing 
power of Hadoop, many organizations have 
started data migration from data storage systems 
into Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS) 
[11]. 
  As organizations acquire Big Data 
management systems there is still the need to keep 
the database systems to fulfill their critical role s. 
Integrating these two environments in an open and 
generic manner is therefore pertinent and needed. 
The aim of this research however is to build a 
software that will integrate these two paradigms, 
the big data platform and the relational database 
management systems.  
This system will enable data to be transferred 
across the two platforms easily without any 
transfer issues which results from transfer via 
bash scripting. This system automates the transfer 
process and is therefore more efficient. 
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. 
Overview to bridging DBMS and BDP is 
presented in Section 2 followed by related work in 
Section 3. Section presents the design of open-
generic software for connecting the two platforms. 
The implementations are results are highlighted in 
Section 5. The software testing and discussion on 
design, implementation and results are also 
presented in Section 6. Section 7 presents 
conclusion and future work. 
 
2 Overview to Bridging Database 
Management systems and Big data Platforms 
2.1 Relational Database Management Systems 
(RDBMS) 
Relational Database Management System 
(RDBMS) data is structured in database tables, 
fields and records. Each RDBM table consists of 
database table rows. Each database table row 
consists of one or more database table fields. 
RDBM store the data into collection of tables, 
which might be related by common fields 
(database table columns) [5]. RDBM also provide 
relational operators to manipulate the data stored 
into the database tables. Most RDBM use SQL as 
database query language. Edgar Codd introduced 
the relational database model. Many modern  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 30  
 DBMS do not conform to the Codd’s definition of 
a RDBMS, but nonetheless they are still 
considered to be RDBMS. The most popular 
RDBM are MS SQL Server, DB2, Oracle, 
Postgresql and MySQL [5]. 
 
2.2 Background to Big Data  
Big data is defined as massive data sets having 
large, more varied and complex structure with the 
difficulties of storing, analyzing and visualizing 
for further processes or results. The paper stated 
that the process of research reveals hidden 
patterns and secret correlations named as big data 
analytics. Big data therefore has the potential to 
provide insights that can transform every 
business. Hadoop was created by BigTable which 
is Google’s data storage system [2]. 
Web provides many opportunities for big data 
too. In the social network analysis such as 
understanding user intelligence for more targeted 
advertising, marketing campaigns and capacity 
planning, customer behavior and buying patterns 
also sentiment analytics [9].Therefore a big data 
platform is a platform where big data is stored.  
Businesses grapple with huge quantities and 
varieties of data on one hand, and ever-faster 
expectations for analysis on the other [10].  
The vendor community is responding by 
providing highly distributed architectures and new 
levels of memory and processing power. Upstarts 
also exploit the open-source licensing model, 
which is not new, but is increasingly accepted and 
even sought out by data-management 
professionals [10]. Apache Hadoop, a nine-year-
old open-source data-processing platform first 
used by Internet giants including Yahoo and 
Facebook, leads the big-data revolution. Cloudera 
introduced commercial support for enterprises in 
2008, and MapR and Hortonworks piled on in 
2009 and 2011, respectively. Among data-
management incumbents, IBM and EMC-spinout 
Pivotal each has introduced its own Hadoop 
distribution. Microsoft and Teradata offer 
complementary software and first-line support for

2.3 Big Data Platforms 
All tables and figures will be processed as images.  
Big Data is an extremely large dataset consisting of variety of data including text, images, multi-
media and logs [11][4]. The volume and velocity 
of such data is so huge that thedata processing 
applications are incapable to store and process. 
Data storage and analysis are two main aspects 
that Big Data is mostly associated with [6] [12]. 
Nowadays, most organization’s crucial data are 
stored in relational databases. Hadoop is an open 
source framework for processing large amounts of 
data in distributed computing environment. It 
plays an important role in processing and 
analyzing the Big Data. This framework is used 
for storing data on large clusters of commodity 
hardware. Data input and output to and from 
Hadoop is an indispensable action for any data 
processing job. At present, many tools have been 
evolved for importing and exporting Data in 
Hadoop [11][9]. 
The key characteristic of Hadoop is that we do 
not have to pre-define the data schema before 
loading data into HDFS. Regardless of the format 
of data (structured, semi-structured and 
unstructured) we can load data into HDFS as it is. 
Also, data pre-processing such as cleansing, 
normalization & aggregation can be done on 
HDFS itself after loading the data. Using Hadoop, 
business domains can reduce operational cost, 
infrastructure cost, avail data storage and new 
analytical models [13]. 
The paper, [1] concerns itself with the digital 
world which is growing very fast and becoming 
more complex in volume, variety and velocity. It 
talks about the fact that big data is considered as  a 
data collection that has grown so large that it 
cannot be effectively managed using conventional 
search engine. In their research, the problem was 
handled by complementing the  RDBMS with an 
alternate DBMS; such as NoSQL, NewSQL and 
search-based systems. 
In [3] conclusions are drawn on the fact that 
there is an insatiable appetite among business 
users to want to analyze new sources of structured 
and multi-structured data to produce new insights 
for competitive advantage. In response to that, 
vendors are building new analytical platforms 
designed specifically for certain analytical 
workloads. 
The challenge now is to find a technology 
partner that can deliver a new analytical  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 31  
 ecosystem that supports the entire spectrum of  
and big data analytical workloads now needed by 
business users. In addition, it all has to be done 
while keeping data governed and everything 
integrated.  
IBM has already identified this requirement. Its 
Big Data Platform is a comprehensive offering 
that includes support for the entire spectrum of 
analytical workloads. It includes a strong IBM 
InfoSphereBigInsights Hadoop offering, the IBM 
Smart Analytic System or IBM PureData System 
for Operational Analytics running the InfoSphere 
Warehouse with a built-in NoSQL graph store, 
IBM PureData System for Analytics powered by 
Netezza technology for complex analytics on 
structured data, InfoSphere Streams for real-time 
analytics on data in motion and IBM DB2 
Analytics Accelerator (IDAA) for accelerating 
operational analytics. In addition the InfoSphere 
information management tools suite underpins the 
entire IBM Big Data Platform providing 
consistent trusted data to all analytical data stor es 
and IBM MDM Server. It also supports data 
virtualization to simplify access to data [17]. 
The Apache Hadoop implementation of 
MapReduce has become an important player in 
this market due to its ability to exploit large 
networks of inexpensive servers. Oracle RDBMS 
has had support for the MapReduce paradigm for 
many years through the mechanism of user 
defined pipelined table functions and aggregation 
objects. However, such support has not been 
Hadoop source compatible. Native Hadoop 
programs needed to be rewritten before becoming 
usable in this framework. The ability to run 
Hadoop programs inside the Oracle database 
provides a versatile solution to database users, 
allowing them use programming skills they may 
already possess and to exploit the growing 
Hadoop eco-system [17].  
[17]described a prototype of Oracle In-
Database Hadoop that supports the running of 
native Hadoop applications written in Java. The 
implementation executes Hadoop applications 
using the efficient parallel capabilities of the 
Oracle database and a subset of the Apache 
Hadoop infrastructure. Also the Oracle In-
Database Hadoop prototype provides an interface 
for Hadoop programmers to execute their applications in the Java way. Users write the 
application drivers to specify the configuration 
parameters of the job. It concluded with the fact 
that the integration of Hadoop with SQL has 
significant importance for both the database 
industry and the database users. [17].  
 
3 Related work 
User interface is the main factor by which users 
are able to learn the goal of application quickly. In 
case of writing commands in some sort of tools, 
such as, command line, often users find 
confusions on remembering commands and 
writing them in proper order. Command line tools 
are more suitable for highly technical users. 
Hence, user interface provides easy to follow and 
learn quickly, as it guides step by step about how 
to proceed to the goal [11]. 
Tools used in the data transfer to the Hadoop 
distributed file system (HDFS) include Sqoop, 
Flume, Chukwa, Scribe, Kafka, HDFS File 
Slurper and DistCp.  
Flume is used to move streaming data to 
HDFS, Scribe is used to collect system logs, 
Chukwa is used to collect data and is similar to 
how flume works, Kafka used for collecting and 
delivering large volumes of log data with low 
latency [16], HDFS File Slurper is an open source 
project, which automatically copies any formats 
of files from local file systems to HDFS and vice 
versa, DistCp is used to move data between 
different HDFS clusters. However since the main 
objective of this research is to move structured 
data from RDBM to Hadoop, then there is the 
need to look more into the tool that make the 
transfer possible. 
 
3.1 Moving Structured Data with Sqoop 
Sqoop [14] [15] is a connection oriented, non-
event based and open source software program for 
moving data between structured data stores and 
distributed file systems. Sqoop mainly used for 
moving structured data (relational tables) stored i n 
MySQL, Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server 
databases on a periodic basis as shown in figure 1.  
Import is performed by reading tables row-by-row 
and writing records into multiple delimited-text or  
Sequenced files in HDFS. Here, each row of a 
relational table is mapped to a record in HDFS.  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 32  
 Map-only jobs are applied to select or insert data 
from RDBM. Multiple tables can be used to 
import data. Data from each table is stored into 
separate directory in HDFS. It uses Map-Reduce 
programming paradigm for parallel processing 
and fault-tolerance. Sqoop consists of a set of 
command-line tools, which can be used 
independently based on the requirement. For 
example, for importing data, “sqoop-import” tool 
is used and for exporting data from HDFS to 
RDBM “sqoop-export” is used [11]. 
The proposed system to bridge the gap between 
the RDBM and the Big Data Platform is GemSoft. 
GemSoft therefore automates the transfer process 
using Sqoop by providing a GUI to make the 
transaction easy and user friendly.GemSoft 
attempts to integrate Big Data platform to 
database systems using open source and generic 
approach. 
 
4Designing Gemsoft 
This section describes into detail the steps taken 
indesigning the GemSoft system. The design 
problem is stated and the process for tackling 
problem explained. The requirements and 
specifications for designing the system are also 
described as well as considerations made in the 
design process and tools used.  
4.1 The Design Problem and Process 
For this project we cho se to use the agile approach 
tosoftware development. The agile methodology 
as shown in figure 1 is a software development 
approach that gives software developers the 
opportunity of directing their software throughout 
the development life cycle. This methodology is 
mostly used by businesses in response to 
unpredictability [22]. 
We specifically selected the Agile Scrum 
Methodology. This development style for 
managing and controlling iterative incremental 
projects. With this the owner of the product works 
closely with the developer to identify and 
prioritize the functionalities of the system in the  
form of features, bug fixes, non-functional 
requirements, etc.- which need to be implemented 
in order to produce a successful sys-tem. 
Increments to the software are delivered in 
'Sprints'. 'Sprints' are regular cadences of work 
and could also be called 'iterations'. On 
completion of a 'Sprint', the functionalities are 
reanalyzed and re-prioritized after which the next 
set of functionalities are chosen for the next 
'Sprint' [21][22]. 
With the scrum methodology there are 
empirical feedback loops to cope with complexity 
and risk. The main emphasis of scrum is making 
decisions from real-world result rather than 
speculation [22].

4.2System Architecture 
The GemSoft system architecture (shown in 
figure 2) is designed to interface with the DBMS 
system via the ATIAA framework powered by 
PHP and it interfaces with the BDP via 
AJUMAMORO.In the GemSoft software design, the software involves three component setups; the 
Graphical User Interface component, the DBMS 
setup and connection and the BDP setup and 
connection.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 2.System architecture. 
This is a high level architecture of GemSoft. 
The flow diagram for GemSoft is shown in 
figure.3. When the page is started, and Database is 
clicked on, a form page appears which allows the 
user to input the connection parameters for a 
specific database. A connection to the database is 
made and the data is loaded including the column 
names in the database. The user then has the 
opportunity to select the columns needed for the 
export and then decides whether to export to the 
big data platform or view the data. When the data 
is exported to the BDP, the user can perform any process desired on the data in that platform. The 
results of the process or another data in the big 
data platform can then be exported from the BDP 
to the RDBM. This data can then be loaded, 
viewed and analysis could be made from the 
graph of the data at GemSoft and the flow could 
be restarted or ended.This is a software 
engineering methodology suitable for the research 
described in this paper.For this research, there is  
the problem of errors and inefficiencies in data 
transfers from the BDP to

Fig.3. System flow diagram 
 
 
 
 
The use cases of the system is shown in figure 
4. In the user scenario, the user can export data 
from RDBM to the BDP after connecting to a 
specific RDBM. The user can also import data 
from the BDP to the RDBM. The user can also 
view data from any RDBM graphically. In the 
system administrator’s case, he has access to all 
the privileges of the user and an added functionality to determine what to do with the 
data in the BDP. This functionality is specific to 
an organization due to the fact that all 
organizations have different needs and therefore 
use data differently. 
The activity of the system is shown in figure 
5.From the GUI, the user sends a request by 
entering the parameters for the connection and the 
user receives the transaction request data, sets 
conditions and then decides whether to view the 
data or export the data to the BDP
.

Fig.5. Activity diagram 
 
The relationships between the various scripts that 
were used in the implementation process of the 
software is shown in figure 6. The index.php 
script is the home page and it is connected to the 
form.php which allows the user to input 
connection parameters to a database, linked to the 
importForm.php and sqoopForm.php which are 
both forms that allows the user to input 
parameters needed for the import and export of 
data across the two paradigms respectively. 
The conditions.php script allows the user to set 
certain conditions on the data that is loaded from 
the TDBMS, it is supported by the conditions.css 
which styles the page and the conditions.js and the graph.php which makes the system responsive and 
also enable the graphing capabilities of the 
system. The sqoopForm.php is linked to the 
addJob.php which adds the export job to the 
ajumamoro job queue; as such the addJob.php is 
connected to theajumamoro.conf.php and the 
exportDb.php (which allows all the tables in the 
database to be exported to the BDP) and the 
exportable.php(which allows a table to be 
exported to the BDP). 
The creatDB.php performs the same job as the 
addJob.php but it is for the import process. The 
importable.php allows import from the BDP
.

4.3The Design Process for moving Data from 
DBMS to BDP  
The design process for moving data from the 
DBMS environment to the BDP platform is 
shown in figure7. The connection to the database 
is established after the connection parameters are provided by the user. The user can then specify 
the data he wants and then either view the data or 
export the data to the BDP.Therefore it describes 
how the export process occurs from the DBMS to 
the BDP.The entire process is an export of data 
from DBMS to BDP
.

Fig. 7.Design process:Moving data from DBMS to BDP.  
 
Before implementing the application, the 
appropriate environment had to be set up. This 
included the installation of the following; 
 
1. Sublime Text Editor :  Sublime is a software 
development tool used in web designs. It uses 
HTML, PHP, CSS, JQUERY, JAVASCRIPT etc. 
Sublime allows the developer to load the whole 
project and program in different languages and 
also enables editing of the codes written. 
2. PhpScripting :  PHP is a recursive acronym for 
Hypertext Preprocessor. It is a web development 
language written by and for web developers. It is 
an interpreted language in that it enables you to 
perform incremental, iterative development and 
testing without going through a compile-test-
debug cycle each time the code is changed. It is an  
open source, server-side scripting language used 
to create dynamic web pages. 
3. Javascript : This is a scripting language that 
gives the power to design interactive websites. 
For this project client-side scripts are written 
using JavaScript and they may run during and 
after the page has loaded. 
Fig. 8.Sequence Diagram  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 38  
  
4. HTML5 : HTML5 is a revision of the 
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the 
standard programming language for describing the 
contents and appearance of web pages.  
5. CSS : This is used to define how HTML 
elements should be displayed on the web page.  
6. Microsoft Visio : Which was used for the 
designs of the software.  
7. Edraw : A software also for designing the 
design diagrams of the system. 
The flow diagram of GemSoft is shown in 
figure 8.The user clicks on database, request data from RDBM by inputting the needed parameters, 
RDBM authorizes the user and then loads the data 
to GemSoft. GemSoft then exports the data to the 
BDP (HDFS). In order to move data from a  
database management system, we use the sqoop 
library which is installed on the cloudera 
distribution. We also have to download the jdbc 
driver jar files for the specific RDBMS we will be 
using. And so the jdbc for Postgresql and Mysql 
were downloaded and installed in the 
/var/lib/sqoop folder. 
 
4.4 The Design Process for moving Data 
from BDP to DBMS 
Moving data from BDP to DBMS is by design an 
import process if viewed from the DBMS side. The process is shown in figure 9. For the import 
process, the user supplies the connection 
parameters and then creates a table for the 
incoming data from the big data platform. The 
data from the BDP is then loaded into the DBMS.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig.9.Design process: Moving data from BDP to DBMS.  
 
 
 
 
Fig. 9: The process 
 
The software environment was set up as follows. The  Oracle Virtual Box was used. The link below 
was used to download the virtual box and 
installed on the Linux operating system on my 
machine. 
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads 
Ajumamoro is a web server that allows 
connection between my local machine and the 
virtual machine. It serves the application through 
the addition of jobs for execution of the 
application processes [20]. Ajumamoro Job Queue 
was also installed. It is a job queue for PHP which  
allows different back ends to store jobs [20]. It 
currently supports MYSQL, POSTGRESQL, 
SQLITE and Redis as back ends. It also provides a simple API through which you can implement 
support for your own storage back end. It is 
installed as a composer dependency for an 
application. This job queue allows the application 
to send requests to the HDFS which is in the 
virtual machine [20]. It allows jobs such as 
moving data across the two paradigms possible. 
A Cloudera VM with Hadoop was installed on 
the computer in the Oracle Virtual Box. The 
Cloudera Distribution supports the Local storage 
system which includes;(i) The File System and (ii) 
The HDFS (pseudo-distributed). The local storage 
in the virtual machine using the HDFS (the 
 
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 39  
 pseudo-distributed mode) was used. This mode is 
mainly for development purposes. The exported 
data to the BDP will be stored in the HDFS. 
The Cloudera Distribution also has the 
following Libraries which were used in this 
research: (i) Map Reduce (version 1.0 and 2.0), 
(ii) Map Reduce Programming Languages; (a)for 
Java (JDK) use Eclipse (b) Hive, Pig, Sqoop, Hue and (c)developer tools.The sequence diagram for 
BDP to TDBMS is shown in figure 10. When the 
import is clicked from the GUI, the data is 
requested from the BDP and when authorized, the 
data is loaded to the TDBMS and then GemSoft 
accesses the data after getting authorization from 
the TDBMS 
.

4.5 Creating a User Component to View Graphs 
High charts library was downloaded and installed 
and implemented in this software system. It 
allows the user to plot area graphs, pie charts, ba r 
graphs and scatter diaThis interface allows the 
user to decide whether to connect to a database 
first or interact with the BDP (Hadoop).gram. 
 
4.7 Creating an Open-Source Software 
The system is an open source integration system 
for developers to modify and share in the design 
of a robust system that will aid in data transfer 
across platforms. The template of the system was 
pushed to GitHub to aid other developers have 
access to the codes and manipulate it to meet their  
needs in data transfer. This will give other 
programmers the chance to add and improve the 
software since the resources of the platform is 
accessible. Also open-source software frameworks 
were used in the design and implementation of the 
system therefore making it also an open-source software. 
 
4.8 Creating a Generic Software and Connection 
to any Database 
Apache server was installed on the local machine. 
Apache is a feature rich web server that works 
well with PHP. It is the most stable of major web 
servers with a reputation for enviable uptime 
percentages. Although it is neither the fastest nor  
the easiest to administer, once you get it up and 
running, Apache HTTP Server seemingly never 
crashes. It also does not require server reboots 
every time a setting is changed hence making it 
very stable. 
The Java (openjkd version -1.8.0-internal) was 
installed on the local machine. Afterwards the 
PostgreSQL (The postgresql.conf file was edited 
so that it listens on all host) was downloaded and 
installed. PHPMyadmin was installed also and it 
serves as the GUI for PostgreSQL. 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18580066/ho
 
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 40  
 w-to-allow-remote-access-to-postgresql-database 
The appropriate subnet mask for the server was 
determined to allow connection to the database. In 
postgresql, the listen_addresses in the 
postgresql.conf file was configured to listen on al l 
host. Also the IPV4 local configuration was also 
set to listen on all host in the $ pg_hba.conf $fil e. 
Also the table to be imported to HDFS has to be 
in the public schema to ensure that HDFS 
recognize it.  
Command to run for the import sqoopimport : 
--connect 
'jdbc:postsql://LocalhostIP Address:5432/Databas
ename'--username=postgres 
-password=gem 
--target-dir /newfoldername 
--fields-terminated-by '\t' 
--table tablename 
-m 1 
After this installation, MySQL which is also 
another RDBM was installed on the local 
machine. The MySQL server is started and a new 
user is created for cloudera with password being 
generated by the MySQL server. The network 
setting of the virtual machine is bridged with that  
of the local machine so that the virtual machine 
could have internet access. Afterwards, the 
mysqld.cnf in the folder /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d 
is edited. The bind-address is set to allow all hos t 
so that the virtual machine could be pinged to the 
localhost. A database could either be created or 
loaded into MySQL and populated with tables. 
Now a terminal is opened in the cloudera virtual 
machine and the directory is changed to the bin 
directory of sqoop. 
Afterwards the command below is run: 
sqoop import 
--connect 
'jdbc:mysql://LocalhostIP Address:3306/Databa
sename' 
--username=cloudera 
--target-dir /newfoldername 
--fields-terminated-by '\t' 
--tabletablename -m 1 
$columnNames[] = $key['column_name']; 
$dataTypes[] = $key['data_type']; 
} 
<? 
The Atiaa framework was then installed. This 
framework allows connection to three database management systems. SQlite, Mysql, Postgresql 
of which I made connections to two [19]. The 
Mysql and Postgresl databases since those two 
were the RDBM considered in this research. 
 
4.9 Design Assumptions 
The assumptions behind GemSoft are shown in 
figure 11. The user should have a basic idea of 
how to connect to databases so that the right 
parameters could be inputted to connect to any 
database in order to prevent errors. Also the user 
should know the parameters needed for 
connection to the BDP. And the user should know 
how to bridge networks across different platforms 
and also have knowledge about internet protocol 
addresses.In order that the system can accomplish 
its duty as an efficient, reliable and user-friendl y 
system, the non-functional requirements are met 
include making images and text on the screen 
bold, legible, concise and comprehensible.

5.1 Implementation, Results and Testing  
The system implementation and testing processes 
are explained in this section. Snippets of codes of  
special interest are displayed and explained here. 
Results prove efficiency of the system to perform 
its function. It was tested on the National Trust 
Holding Company Network in Accra, Ghana and 
also on the hot-spot of a smart phone. The project 
files were made available to a colleague who 
installed the necessary components on his system 
and then worked with the system.

5.2 Implementation of the Software between the 
RDBM and the BDP 
The GemSoftplatform was implemented using the 
index.php script and other scripts to create the GUI in the form of web pages. In figure 12,  the 
index page of GemSoft accessed via the 
localhost.This interface allows the user to decide 
whether to connect to a database first or interact 
with the BDP (Hadoop). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 12.Index page of GemSoft. 
5.3Implementation of Open Connectivity to  
TDBMS 
This objective is met by implementing the 
form.php script which allows the user to input the database parameters in order to connect to any 
database in the TDBMS.The implementation of 
the form for inputting parameters required to 
connect to a database.
.

West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 42  
  
 It connects to the conditions.php page which 
loads the data from the database. In order to test 
that the right parameters were inputted, when the 
connect button is clicked, the conditions page is 
opened as shown in figure 14.This page allows 
data to be loaded from the database. After setting the conditions another form as shown in figure 15 
is presented which allows the user to select the 
columns of a table in the TDBMS to be 
previewed.The form in figure 15is a page allows 
the user to select the columns to be exported
.

When the columns have been selected there is still 
an option to filter the columns to be exported 
using the page shown in Fig. 16. This page also allows certain constraints to be made on the 
selected columns so that a new table could be 
generated
.

5.4 Implementation of the Movement of Data from TDBMS t o the BDP 
In order to export a table from TDBMS to the BDP, t he form for inputting the connection parameters is 
shown in Fig. 17. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 17. Table export Form. 
 
 
 
 
The user inputs the local host Internet Protocol (I P) 
address and the virtual host IP address and the 
directory the data is to be stored in. Once the exp ort button is clicked on, a job is added to the 
ajumamoro.conf.php once it has been started and 
the script shown infigure 18 is run
.

script which creates the bash script shown in 
figure which is exportable.sh and the log of the process displays in the exportTable.Out.The bash 
script in figure 19 allows an export of all the 
tables in the database to the BDP and its 
corresponding form is shown in figure 20.

5.6Implementing the Component for the 
Graphical View 
High charts library for graphs in website was 
downloaded and installed and used for the 
graphing capabilities of GemSoft. When a user 
loads data from the RDBM, the user can view the 
relationship between various entities by graphing 
them.GemSoft provide the following graph types: 
area graph (figure 22), scatter diagram (figure 23) , 
pie chart (figure 24), line graph (figure 25) and b ar

This command helps you to view the items found in t he HDFS. It also allows you to view the 
permissions of the file whether to read,write,execu te etc. This command opens up two imported files in  
the target directory. The file with the part-m-0000 0 contains the imported data. Import and export 
processes are completely map jobs only; that is why the output file has extension "/part-m-00000". . 
It produces just one output map file in our case be cause we are running in a pseudo-distributed mode 
and so we require just one map job: which was speci fied in the import process with "-m 1". If you do 
not specify -m 1 by default, your sqoop will be usi ng four mappers for importing and exporting so that  
the task can be done in parallel if there are multi ple machines. Meaning multiple machines can make 
multiple connections to my database. Since we were using a single machine we used 1 mapper. To 
display the contents of the file, the command below was run: 
hadoop fs -cat /newfoldername/part-m-00000 
 
6.2Testto show whether Data was imported to RDBM 
The database parameters are inputted once again and  then the data is loaded. Also the particular RDBM 
could be opened to check and for the imports made, t heir tables were in the RDBM. 
6.3Discussions 
This GemSoft system under much deliberation 
was designed as a web application. A Web 
application is platform independent and would 
offer flexibility in the operating system platform 
used. Also using a web application means 
software updates are easier. Only the code on the 
server is changed and this updates all systems in 
the network. The main purpose of GemSoft is to 
close the gap between the RDBM and the BDP. It 
will therefore automate the process of transferring  
data across the two paradigms under 
consideration. 
The research will help organizations to 
diversify their data storage systems. As data 
management systems keep evolving, there is the 
need for an efficient way of transferring data to 
various new platforms. This will help industries to  
be a top notch at managing their data, since they 
are in sync with their evolving data and providing 
the systems that aid it in gleaning the needed 
information. 
Further on it will help organizations to manage 
data from different sources in one environment. 
Data from different RDBMS could be managed 
on a single big data platform to glean the needed 
information from it [11]. 
The system allows organizations to migrate 
data from different database management system 
sources to a big data platform. If an organization stores its data on different RDBMS, this project 
will aid it to move and transfer data from their 
respective RDBMS to the Big Data Platform. 
The system is an open source integration 
system for developers to modify and share in the 
design of a robust system that will aid in data 
transfer across platforms. This will give other 
programmers the chance to add and improve the 
software since the resources of the platform is 
accessible. This system also has graphing 
capabilities which allows users to graph data 
entries in order to analyze data. 
 
7 Conclusion and Future Work 
7.1 Conclusion 
This section presents the conclusions drawn from 
the results of the project and putting them side by  
side with the objectives it shows that all the 
objectives were met. Therefore movement of data 
across the database platform and the big data 
platform has been made possible. 
From the objectives outlined in section 1.2, the 
following were created as part of GemSoftas can 
be seen from sections 4 and 5: 
1. A connection to any database from the 
software to the database management system.  
2. A mechanism to move data from the database 
to the big data platform. 
3. A mechanism to move data from the big data 
platform to the database management system.   
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 49  
 4. A user component to view data in the form of 
graphs. 
5. A generic software which is able to connect 
to any database making it generic. In its current 
implementation, the user can connect to either 
MySQL or PostgreSQL provided the user inputs 
the right database parameters. 
6. An open source software for database 
administrators. The software template has been 
made available on the GitHub open-source 
website, therefore making it an open-source 
software. Also open-source software frameworks 
were used in the implementation of the software 
therefore making it open-source software. 
The need to help organizations diversify their 
data storage systems makes this research relevant. 
This makes it possible to help organizations 
manage data from different sources in one 
environment. This system allows organizations to 
migrate data from different database management 
system sources to a big data platform. The 
implementation of this software in an open source 
platform integration system will enable 
developers to have access to the software 
template. The integration of graphs from data is 
necessary to aid in data analysis.  
 7.2 Future Work 
This research implemented and tested Hadoop 
platform. Further work will consider 
implementing and testing other Big Data 
Platforms. This will give organizations the 
opportunity to diversify their storage management 
systems.Other Relational Database Managements 
apart from the two used in the implementation 
process could be added to the system. This will 
aid other organizations with other RDBMS apart 
from the two used in the implementation to also 
use the system (GemSoft) to their advantage.

Big geospatial data and could also be incorporated 
in the system. It will be interesting to bridge 
spatial databases to Big geospatial, for example, 
spatial Hadoop to PostGIS

Abstract 
Authentication has become an essential part of our everyday lives through systems like 
passwords, PIN codes, card readers, fingerprint- , and retina scanners. All designed with one 
purpose; to confirm a person’s identity. Brain wave  Biometric Authentication Security System is 
another addition to the wide range of authenticatio n systems, but with a brand new concept. The 
electrical activity in a human brain is used to con firm the identity. Instead of physically writing a 
password, one can simply think about it. The passwo rd or ”pass-thought” can be anything that a 
human mind may think about, like a colour, a feelin g, an image, text or something else. The 
benefits over other systems are many. With a standa rd password someone can watch or 
”shoulder-surf” what others type, but no one can wa tch thoughts. Cards and keys can be lost, 
but the brain is always present. Handicaps can excl ude people from systems like fingerprint- or 
retina scanners, but the brain still works. This pr oject research is aimed at the possibilities for a 
brainwave based authentication Security system. A Driving scenes (racing game) generated by 
the PlayStation 3 (PS3) was utilize as a driving si mulator.  The researchers ended up with a 
complete authentication system, but based on what i s already done in related work the 
researchers believes that an implementation of a br ainwave biometric based authentication 
security system is just a matter of time.

Introduction
In this computer driven era, with the increase 
in security threats, securing and managing the 
resources has become a more complex 
challenge. Maintaining and managing access 
while protecting the user’s identity and 
computer resources has become increasingly 
difficult.  Therefore, it is crucial to design a 
high security system that has a strong 
authentication process to authenticate an 
individual. Authentication, verifying the user, 
who he claims to be, is the central to all 
security systems. With the world getting ready 
to transit from Graphic User Interface (GUI) 
to Natural User Interface (NUI) technology, where it is possible to communicate with 
computers by using touch, gestures, voice, 
expressions, emotions and thoughts. Gürkök, 
H., & Nijholt, A. (2012). In this research, the 
researchers has made an attempt to 
demonstrate an authentication system based 
on thoughts. 
 
Background of the Study  
The society is transforming into a digital 
world and individuals are now living with 
digital identities. Banking, shopping, 
examinations, home security, information 
security, car security system etc has all gone  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 52  
 digital. Digital identities are having intensives 
that should be pre-recorded to help machine 
for user authentication.  
 
Statement of problems  
The problems associated with the present 
authentication system includes but not limited 
to: the danger of a onetime authentication 
system as a user can be replaced after 
authentication, Password theft and wax 
molding and printing to bypass fingerprint and 
iris scanning technology. Aim and objectives  
The objectives of this research include 
designing a system: 
1.  That will effectively authenticate 
users. 
2. That can provide authentication 
information unconsciously 
3. Eliminate password theft, wax molding 
and printing.  
 
Significance of the Study 
There have been cases of breached biometric 
technology, situations when users finger are 
cut out to perform authentication elsewhere. 
Cases when the exact mold of a user is molded 
with wax, cases when a users iris is scanned 
and used to perform authentication, cases 
when an authentic user is made to perform 
authentication and then killed as he/she is no 
longer needed.  
 
Scope of the Study 
This study presents an overview of Brainwave 
Authentication Security System; its highlights 
are on autonomous and unconscious on-
demand authentication system for a driver 
using brainwave.  
 
Literature review 
A digital identity is information used to 
represent persons, organizations, or machines 
in information systems and networks. 
The term digital identity has three distinct 
senses: computational, legal and social. 
In the computational sense, a digital identity is 
information that allows a computer interacting 
with another agent to perform the following functions: identification, classification, and 
recollection. 
In the legal sense, a digital identity is a 
function of a person’s civil, or national, 
identity (Clare, 2009).  
In the social sense, digital identity refers to 
any collection of information that describes a 
person, and which was generated by that 
person’s online activity. 
 
Working of biometric process  
The detail of the human being which differs 
from one person to other is used as unique 
biometric data to provide as that person's 
unique identification (ID) or recognition. The 
body parts such as retinal, fingerprint, iris, 
palm print and DNA. Biometric system 
collects and stores this data in order to verify 
any person’s identity. The combination of 
biometric data and biometric 
identification/recognition technologies creates 
the biometric security systems. Biometric 
system is more and more personnel than 
anyone’s passport.  
 
Benefits of a biometrics security system  
• There are possibilities of hacking keys 
or duplicated; signatures could be forged, 
passwords could be easily stolen or hacked by 
a specialist people. To avoid all these 
accidental losses; banks and other institutions 
should enter biometric security and all our 
fears could be laid to rest.  
• Signature biometric type of 
verification is done normally in transaction 
related operations.   
 
EEG and HCI 
Research in brain-computer interface (BCI) 
has established the feasibility of using 
Electroencephalography (EEG) signals to 
control computers and other devices. BCI 
systems can reliably evoke and measure 
event-related potentials (ERP) such as the 
P300, and use them to spell words and move 
computer cursors based on a user's intent (E. 
Donchin, et al, 2000); (T. Hinterberger, et al, 
2003); (F. Nijboer, et al, 2008). This proves  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 53  
 very valuable in restoring the ability to 
communicate for patients suffering from the 
locked-in syndrome and other neurological 
diseases, and can be generalized to healthy 
users as well. While our work does not seek to infer user intent from their EEG signals, our 
choice of user tasks involving external stimuli 
are informed by the efficacy of eliciting and 
capturing these event-related potentials.

In the verification, an EEG is measured once 
in the mental-tasked condition and the 
verification score S is calculated by:  
S = ∑||sr
t – stm| − |sr
t – sm||p  -------- (1) 
    
Where P is the number of partitions, sr
t and 
sm
t are templates in the relaxed and tasked 
condition, respectively and smis a mean 
value of a partition in the tasked condition at 
the verification stage. 
If S is less than a threshold, the user is 
authenticated genuine.  
 
Implementation Procedure 
Experiments in practical driving carry a risk 
of having some accident. There is a way to 
introduce a special training simulator that is 
possible to simulate the driving in a 
laboratory but it has also an issue of cost. 
Therefore, I adopted a simplified driving simulator that was composed of gaming 
machines.  
 
Simplified Driving Simulator 
Driving scenes were generated by the 
PlayStation 3 (PS3) as hardware and the 
Gran Turismo 5 Prologue (GT5P) as 
software produced by Sony Computer 
Entertainment Inc. However, the GT5P was 
a racing game and so the following settings 
were applied to utilize it as a driving 
simulator. 
• Set a manual transmission to the first gear to 
limit the maximum speed of a car to 65 
km/h 
• Set a driving course to an urban road in 
London to drive the car in a general road 
• Set a racing mode to time trial, that is, solo 
drive to avoid accidents with other cars 
 
Fig. 1.  A still image of the driving scene is shown 
 
The driving scenes were displayed on a 60-
inch screen and the size was 1100 mm by 
830mm. The distance between the screen and 
a subject was 1300 mm. These had been 
preliminary determined using nine subjects based on evaluation how views from the 
subjects were similar with practical ones. A 
handle, accelerator and brake were equipped 
by imitated controllers: Driving Force GT p P=1

Summary of Results  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 56  
 In this research, the researchers focused 
attention on brain waves as unconscious 
biometrics. In particular, assuming driver 
authentication, we measured the brain waves 
of drivers when they were using a simplified 
driving simulator. We extracted the power 
spectrum at β band as an individual feature 
and proposed a verification method based on 
similarities of the features. In addition, we 
divided the β band into four or six partitions 
and fused sub-scores from the partitions. As a 
result of experiments using 23 subjects, we 
obtained the EER of about 20 %. 
 
Conclusion 
From the results of the above experiments, 
Brainwave as a means of authentication offer far greater efficiency than any other means of 
authentication used today. Car theft will be a 
thing of the past if this type of authentication 
is implored in transportation companies. It 
may even help to reduce kidnapping as 
someone else will not be able to forcefully 
drive your car.  
 
Recommendations 
Brainwave authentication will certainly be a 
better method of authentication than the 
fingerprint and passwords used in today’s 
ATM and access control systems. The 
researchers will recommend that brainwave 
authentication be employed in those areas
.

Abstract 
This study investigates the impact of E-Marketing a nd Guest Patronage in Hotels in Port 
Harcourt. In the course of the study, four (4) hypo theses were formulated, all in null form. These 
hypotheses were tested at 5% level of significance.  The quasi-experimental research design was 
adopted. Our target population is made up of the nu mber of Guests who patronize our selected 
Hotels in Port Harcourt. One Hundred and thirty two  (132) copies of the questionnaire were 
distributed to the respondents and, one hundred and  four (104) copies were duly completed and 
returned. The returned copies of the questionnaire were analyzed statistically using simple 
percentage, and frequency tables. The data analysis  technique used was Spearman’s Rank 
Correlation. The four hypotheses were all tested us ing the SPSS (statistical package for social 
sciences). The findings revealed that there is sign ificant relationship between e-marketing and 
guest patronage. Based on the findings, we recommen d that hotels should have secured and 
trusted website that can’t leak customers’ personal  information. The researchers suggest that 
more variables on E-Marketing Challenges and online  Patronage should be used in subsequent 
studies.

Introduction
Guest satisfaction is a key success factor of any 
Hospitality organization. The satisfaction of a 
guest is a function of the relationship that exists  
between the guest and organization. Improved 
ability to target customers with integrated 
channels could improve sales effectively. Also, 
individualized marketing messages, with 
customized products will help improve the 
efficiency and effectiveness of Hotels.Guest’s 
requirements for quality products and service in 
the Hospitality industry have become 
increasingly evident to professionals [54]. Guest 
relationships and service quality are strategic 
assets of an organization. Customer satisfaction 
is the starting point to define business 
objectives. Long-term and reciprocally 
advantageous relationships between customers and Hotel are becoming progressively important 
because of the high positive correlation between 
guests' overall satisfaction level and the 
probability of their return to the same Hotel 
[54].  
 
Electronic Marketing E-Marketing 
E-Marketing could be viewed as a modern 
business practice involving marketing of goods, 
services, information and ideas via the Internet 
and other electronic means. According to [45] 
E-marketing has achieved marketing objectives 
through digital technologies. [45], has stressed 
that when E-marketing is properly utilized, it 
would provide detailed product information 
which could improved services and attract more 
patronage to Hotels. Furthermore, e-marketing  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 58  
 brings about improvement in the market share 
of Hotels.  This could be possible because e-
marketing uses all facets of internet advertising 
to generate response from the prospective and 
existing customers. 
 
Patronage 
Patronage is a choice behavior that 
represents an individual’s preference for a 
particular brand of product of an 
organization over another. The decision to 
patronize a product or services of an 
organization usually starts with a set of 
characteristics or attributes that consumers 
consider important [34]. Consumers often 
use attributes such a quality of product and 
price of product to determine which product 
could cater to their needs. [21], is of the 
view that patronage behavior involves 
decision process which could be related to 
where consumers buy, how they buy, and 
what they purchase. [39], has said that 
patronage measures the degree to which a 
customer makes his/her purchases either 
from a particular marketer or at a particular 
outlet in relation to competitors.  
 
Development Of Hotels 
The history of Hotels could be traced to the 
development of the railway system in 
Britain [37]. It was stated that when the first 
roads were built in Britain, merchants and 
other wealthy travelers journeyed to various 
parts of the country. At some points on their 
journeys shelter, food and drink were to be 
found at road side Taverns. Later on 
Missionaries provided Hospitality to raise 
money for the church. Large minor houses 
scattered throughout the country provided 
services to travelers [43]. 
When the minor houses began to be taxed, the 
Lords of the minors began converting their 
homes into Inns [17]. An Inn could provide Rest 
but a Tavern could provide only food and drink 
gradually the Inns and Taverns improved in 
Quality and Standard. Laws existed then concerning accommodation premises as far back 
as 1550. From 1750 to 1825English Inns gained 
reputation of being the first in the world and 
reached theirpeak of development from 1780 to 
1825. 
According to [[17], Ellsworth Statler 
invented the first modern commercial Hotel 
in 1908. Many services and conveniences 
that were provided by Hotels today were 
first introduced in this Hotel to increase the 
guest comfort. The Hotel is said to contained 
many structural engineering designs; for this 
reason, Statler Hotel became the model for 
the modern Hotel construction for the next 
forty years, [17]. 
In the 1950s Motels came up. Intensive 
competition existed in the Hotel industry 
during 1970 to 1980 and Hotels were made 
available depending on the wants and needs 
of the consumer, such as luxury Hotels, 
Commercial Hotels, Resort Hotels and 
Motels [48]. The persistent competitions 
among the Hoteliers led to the increase in 
the number of amenities. Guest services 
such as automatic check out, free parking, 
airport transportation, twenty-four hour 
service, and multilingual staff were designed 
to bolster the Hotel's appeal, which would 
mean to enhance guests staying longer or 
coming back again for a repeat experience. 
From the above it could be concluded that 
the Hotel industry provides services for 
people who are away from home regardless 
of whether it is for long or short periods of 
time. These services can vary according to 
the specific needs of both the person away 
from home and the organization operating 
those services [4]. 
Empirically [2] is of the view that homepage 
presentation is a major antecedent of guest 
patronage. The other antecedents; such as 
logical support, technological characteristics, 
information characteristics and product 
characteristics; are also predictive factors to 
satisfaction. [8], has stressed the factors which 
make commercial web pages popular. It was  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 59  
 stated that a high daily hit-rate is strongly 
influenced by the number of updates made to 
the website in the preceding three month period. 
The links to other websites were also discovered 
to attract visitors’ traffic. Providing feedback 
section for customers would lead to higher sales.  
While significant research has been done on the 
subject matter in the developed  nations, 
evidence from existing literature on this subject 
matter however suggests that there is a limited 
knowledge about the phenomenon in most 
developing countries especially Nigeria. This is 
particularly with the attitude Nigerians have 
toward online patronage. This study would 
highlight various ways of regaining the market 
shares lost by Hotel operators by itemizing the 
various strategies necessary for maintenance of 
their effectiveness over time. 
 
Statement of the Problem 
The failure of many Hotels to operate profitably 
as been blamed on increasingly rapid change in 
consumer preferences, poor service delivery, 
faster technological progress, growing 
competitive rivalry and their inability to 
formulate strategies within their organizations to 
generate market information, analyze, and 
respond accordingly. One observable pattern is 
that most hotels appear to record declining 
customer patronage after few years of operation. 
This is evident by the scanty number of guests 
and visitors.  
Many experts believe that many hotels, 
especially the small-sized variants are not 
popular and up to standard because they lack 
some of the basic facilities needed by fun 
seekers. Such facilities include; executive 
rooms, conference rooms, night club bars, fully 
equipped fitness clubs, swimming pools, 
shopping villages, outside catering and grounds 
for outdoor activities. While facility deficits 
have been identified as factors affecting 
patronage, it appears that many hotels lack e-
marketing channels needed for attracting and 
increasing guests’ patronage and by extension 
increase revenue and profitability. Hotels have been accused of lacking strategies to seek, 
gather and store the right information, validate 
and share it throughout the entire organization 
for the creation of personalized, unique and 
guests’ experience, hence their dismal 
performance. 
However, this has not been verified 
empirically. It is in the light of the above 
that this study is undertaken to examine the 
importance of e-marketing and its influence 
on guest’s patronage, bearing our empirical 
focus on selected hotels in Port Harcourt. 
This study sets to remedy the problems of 
low patronage of guests by highlighting the 
various strategies that hotels can implement 
so as to regain their market share.

8 Materials And Method  
Descriptive research was carried out. The 
Quasi-experimental research design was 
adopted; most suitable for research in 
administrative sciences. Quasi-experimental 
research design was also utilized.  
1. Method Of Data Collection And 
Instrument Design  
The questionnaire was used in getting the 
primary data. The descriptive survey was 
done through the distribution of closed 
ended and open ended structured 
questionnaire. 
 
2. Population of the Study  
Our target population is made up of the 
number of customers who patronize the 
selected Hotels in Port Harcourt.The 
researchers selected a population of four (4) 
Hotels in Port Harcourt and sampled only 
the numbers of customers available in the 
selected Hotels. The distribution is as shown 
in Table 1 belo

3. Sample Size 
The simple random sampling technique was adopted in  the study. This technique gives all 
respondents equal chance of being selected for the study. Therefore, the Taro Yamen Formula as 
stated below: 
 
                                                         n   =

4Validity and Reliability  
     12.1: Validity  
Validity is the extent to which data collected 
are relevant to be the specific objectives of the 
research. The validity of a questionnaire is its 
ability to generate responses that are needed in 
order to study the problem of the research. 
Validity is therefore the ability of the 
instrument to measure what it is intended to 
measure. The questionnaire is validated by the 
researchers for assessment and finally 
corrections were effected for final production. 
 
12.2: Reliability 
The reliability of the questionnaire in 
generating required data was determined using 
Cronbach's Alpha and used to test for 
consistency of the research instrument adopted 
for the study. The reliability of the questionnaire was 
ascertained with the use of the test-retest 
reliability technique. The instruments were 
administered to 25 respondents not involved 
in the study. After two weeks the test was 
carried out again on the same respondents. 
The findings gave a correlation coefficient 
value of 0.76 which is generally accepted to 
be high according to the Cronbach Alfa test 
statistics. 
 
4   Data Analysis  And Interpretation  
The Spearman Rank correlation coefficient 
was used. This statistical tool was considered 
appropriate for testing the hypotheses of the 
study since it was necessary to measure the 
degree of relationship that exists between two 
variable
The spearman ranking correlation formula is thus: 
Rho = 1  
Where Rho = rank of correlation coefficient 
    ∑d = rank of X minus rank of Y 
    N = number of observation

In the investigation of the relationship 
between E-marketing and Guest Patronage, 
all the four (4) Null Hypotheses formulated 
were rejected. This means that there is a 
relationship between E-marketing and Guest 
Patronage. The Spearman’s Rank 
Correlation Co-efficient showed very high 
influence between E-marketing and Guest 
Patronage.

18: Recommendations 
Based on the findings of this study, the 
following were recommended: 
i. Some customers are highly socially connected 
and rely on other peoples’ opinions when 
making purchase decision tend. Therefore, 
Hotels using electronic marketing channels 
should provide online helps for customers; his 
will help create social connection. 
ii. Hotels should create attractive and user 
friendly websites. This is because customers may be influenced by the image of the web 
site when they decide on which website they 
should buy from. 
iii. Hotels should have secured and trusted 
website that would not leak customer’s 
personal information. This is because 
customer’s enthusiasm to patronize online 
services is affected by consumer’s trust in 
giving personal information and security for 
payment through credit card transactions.

Abstract 
Cloud is a metaphor for network that provides its s ervices such as dynamic resource pools, high 
availability and virtualization using Internet know  as Cloud Computing. Cloud Computing 
provides resources to the users over internet as pe r their demand. Service on demand is an 
important feature of cloud computing as it enables the user to pay for the required resources 
only. There are many Cloud Service Providers (CSP) such as Google, Microsoft, IBM, Oracle 
Corporation, Amazon Web Services, etc. which provid e cloud services to users. Since cloud 
computing involves sending data over internet, secu rity breach needs to be monitored and 
controlled. In this paper we propose hybrid algorit hm security technique. It achieves this by 
implementing Multilevel Encryption and Decryption a lgorithm. The Proposed Algorithm consists 
of hybridization of three algorithms.Thess new algo rithms is hybrid of DES, RSA as Digital 
Signature and Twofish Algorithm. This will provide additional security in the cloud environment 
.It will ensure that only the authorized users can a ccess the data. It will provide secure 
communication over distributed and connected resour ces authentication of stored data. This can 
also completely prevent the damage of data. .

Introduction 
Cloud Computing is internet based technology 
which has evolved in the field of IT over the 
past few years. Cloud computing makes the 
transfer or storage of bulk data easy to be 
transferred and maintained for usage. 
Organizations need not buy special hardware 
fordeploying different applications since cloud 
computing provides with pay-as-you-go 
pricing basis which means that all the 
resources like firewall, server, database and so 
on that are required by an organization for the 
deployment of an application may be leased 
out by some other organization which deals in 
providing those resources. The latter 
organizations are known as cloud vendors. 
Hence leasingout of resources does not levy 
high cost on the users and at the same time it 
gives business to other people as well. So, 
cloud computing is fast becoming popular in 
the field of IT and is gaining attention of 
various organizations (JasleenKaur,etal, 
2015).Cloud computing is a collection of  
  
virtual machines in which user only uses the 
services provided by the virtual machines they 
don’t have a control on virtual machines. In 
cloud computing several organizations store 
their data on a single virtual server sometimes 
multiple operating systems are executed on a 
single virtual server, in this case there is 
chances of threat from other machine. So there 
is a need of high level security especially in 
public cloud system.(MdAsifMushtaque, etal , 
2014) 
There are some main characteristics of cloud 
computing: 
On-demand self-service. Cloud computing 
resources can be procured and disposed of by 
the consumer without human interaction with 
the cloud service provider. This automated 
process reduces the personnel overhead of the 
cloud provider, cutting costs and lowering the 
price at which the services can be offered.  
 Resource pooling. By using a 
technique called “virtualization,” the cloud 
provider pools his computing resources. This 
resource pool enables the sharing of virtual  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 71  
 and physical resources by multiple consumers, 
“dynamically assigning and releasing 
resources according to consumer demand” 
(NIST 2009a). The consumer has no explicit 
knowledge of the physical location of the 
resources being used, except when the 
consumer requests to limit the physical 
location of his data to meet legal 
requirements.  
 Broad network access. Cloud services are 
accessible over the network via standardized 
interfaces, enabling access to the service not 
only by complex devices such as personal 
computers, but also by light weight devices 
such as smart phones.  
 Rapid elasticity. The available cloud 
computing resources are rapidly matched to 
the actual demand, quickly increasing the 
cloud capabilities for a service if the demand 
rises, and quickly releasing the capabilities 
when the need for drops.  
 Measured service. Cloud computing enables 
the measuring of used resources, as is the case 
in utility computing. The measurements can 
be used to provide resource efficiency 
information to the cloud provider, and can be 
used to provide the consumer a payment 
model based on “pay-per-use.” For example, 
the consumer may be billed for the data 
transfer volumes, the number of hours a 
service is running, or the volume of the data 
stored per month.( NIST ,2009)  
 Pay as you need:  users to pay for only the 
resources they actually use and for only the 
time they require them.  Highly abstracted:  server hardware and 
related network infrastructure is highly 
abstracted from the users. 
 Multi-tenant:  multi-tenant architectures allow 
numerous customer enterprises to subscribe to 
the cloud computing capabilities while 
retaining privacy and security over their 
information. 
 Immediately scalable:  usage, capacity, and 
therefore cost, can be scaled up or down with 
no additional contract or penalties. 
(Navia Jose, Clara Kanmani A, 
2013).  
Some of the famous cloud providers are: 
A. Google: Google provides internet services 
for storing and accessing the data as and when 
required. It provides various services such as 
mailing, storing of various documents, 
translation, sharing of documents to selected 
users, etc. The most commonly used service of 
Google is Google Drive which is used for 
sharing of personal data through internet. 
B. Microsoft: Microsoft provides internet 
services for file sharing and storing through its 
office applications. Microsoft Cloud storage 
patents are Microsoft Azure and OneDrive for 
storing enormous data and then accessing it 
from any location. 
C. Salesforce.com: Salesforce provides online 
services for sales, support and businesses 
through remote access from any location and 
at any time

The following definition of cloud computing has bee n developed by the U.S. National 
Institute of Standards andTechnology (NIST): 
 
Cloud computing is a model for enabling 
convenient, on-demand network access to a 
shared pool of configurable computing 
resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, 
applications, and services) that can be rapidly 
provisioned and released with minimal 
management effort or service provider 
interaction. This cloud model promotes 
availability and is composed of five essential 
characteristics, three service models, and four 
deployment models. 
 
1.1 Deployment models of cloud computing 
In Cloud computing, available deployment 
models are: 
 Private cloud: The cloud infrastructure 
is operated solely for an organization. It may be 
managed by the organization or a third party and 
may exist on premise or off premise.The only 
big advantage that private cloud has over public 
cloud is that of data security and privacy,(IDA, 
New Delhi, 2014).Security can be easily 
managed using private cloud. Example ofprivate 
cloud is intranet. 
 Public cloud:  A public cloud is one 
based on the standard cloud computing model in which a service provider makes resources  such 
as applications and storage available to the 
general public over the internet.The benefits of 
using a public cloud service are : 
Scalability to meet needs 
No wasted resources because you pay for what 
you use. 
Easy and inexpensive setup because hardware, 
application and bandwidth costs are covered by 
the provider. 
Google, Amazon and Microsoft sales force.com 
are examples of public cloud vendors who offer 
their services to the general public, (IDA, New 
Delhi, 2014) 
1. Hybrid cloud: Hybrid cloud is defined as a 
cloud infrastructure composed of two or more 
cloud infrastructures (private, public, and 
community clouds) that remain unique entities, 
but are bound together via technologies and 
approaches for the purposes of application and 
data portability( Bakshi, K.  2014). Hybrid 
clouds are more complex than the other 
deployment models. One of the disadvantages 
of these services is that we have to manage 
different security platforms together.

Cloud Service Delivery Models  
According to NIST, the service / delivery 
models of cloud computing  is composed of 
three service models: 
 
Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) 
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):  IaaS is the 
last layer of the cloud computing stack AND 
provides their consumers with low level 
infrastructure resources, such as storage, 
Content Delivery Network (CDN), 
computational power, networks, backup and 
recovery, as a service.  . IaaS provides basic 
security, including perimeter defenses, such as  
rewalls, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSes), 
and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSes)  
(Diogo A. B. Fernandesetal., 2013). 
Typical IaaS consumers consist of system 
developers, network engineers, system 
administrators, monitoring engineers and IT 
managers.TheIaaS model is the simplest for 
cloud service providers to provision. It may 
include the following elements:Processing, 
Storage,Network . Examples of commercial 
implementations of IaaS include IBM Smart 
Cloud Enterprise and Enterprise+, IBM Smart 
Cloud managed backup, Amazon Elastic 
Compute Cloud (EC2). 
 
 
 Platform as a service (PaaS) 
Platform as a Service (PaaS): Database, 
middleware, and integration bus are examples 
of platform resources that are provided by 
PaaS providers as a service. 
PaaS, the middleware model, allows 
customers to build their own applications by 
delivering services in the form of program 
development tools, platforms and 
Frameworks |a container where customers run 
their components. PaaS services are normally 
consumed by developers, testers,  deployers, 
middleware/ integration engineers and 
application administrators. (Diogo A. B. 
Fernandesetal., 2013)Google App Engine is an 
example of a popular PaaS. The following 
examples are of services that are provisioned 
in PaaS models: Middleware, Application 
servers ,Database servers ,Portal 
serversDevelopment runtime 
environments.Examples of commercial 
implementations of PaaS environments 
include IBM SmartCloud Application 
Services, Amazon Relational Database 
Service, and Microsoft Windows Azure.

 Software As A Service (Saas) : 
The top model, SaaS, allows applications to be 
remotely deployed and hosted in clouds. All 
types of softwares including Financial, CRM, 
HR, Sales, and assistance can be delivered as 
a service. Salesforce.com, Google Docs, and 
Zoho Docs are some examples of SaaS 
services. Consumers of SaaS services, who are 
usually end users of the application or software administrators, access these types of 
softwares through web browsers or mobile 
apps. Examples of commercial 
implementations of SaaS environments 
include IBM Payment Systems, IBM 
SmartCloud for Social Business, PeopleSoft 
HR, Google Apps for Business. (Saman 
Zarandioon, 2012)

Virtualization  
The virtualization is all the technical 
materialand/or software that can run on a 
single machine multiple operating systems 
and/or multiple applications, separately from 
each other, as if they were working on 
separate physical machines. 
Virtualization and consolidation can simplify 
the management of the server’s park, by 
reducing the number of machines to be 
maintained by optimizing the use of resources 
and enabling high availability. Among the reasons for adopting virtualization are server 
consolidation and infrastructure 
optimization,virtualization can significantly 
increase the rate ofresource utilization by 
pooling common resources and leaving the 
scheme "application = server".With  
virtualization you can reduce the number of 
servers and the amount of hardware needed 
inthe data-center. This is represented by lower 
real estate costs and the need for power and 
cooling,resulting in a net reduction of IT  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 75  
 costs.Increased flexibility and operational 
efficiency: Virtualization offers a new way of 
managing ITinfrastructure and can help IT 
administrators spend less time on repetitive 
tasks such as provisioning,monitoring and 
maintenance. It also enables increased 
availability of applications, improved 
continuityof services, save and move safely entire virtual environments without 
interrupting services and improving the 
management and security of workstations: 
administer, deploy, manage and 
monitorclosely the servers. Virtualization 
techniques  are numerous, and the choice of 
the proper technique requires a detailed study 
of IT platform to virtualize
. 
 
 
Figure3.Various Types of VirtualizationSource:  Mah a TEBAA, etal , 2013 
 
A. Virtual Machine: 
A Virtual Machine is software that runs on the 
operating system (OS) host. This software 
allows you to run one or more guest OS, each 
of which has access at virtualized hardware 
but it thinks interact directly with the physical 
hardware, this solution allows to isolate the 
guest operating systems but it’s a weak point 
is high consumption of resources (reduced 
performance of I/O and limitation of CPU 
performance). 
 
B. Isolator : 
An Isolator is software to isolate the execution 
of applications in the different performance's areas. The isolator allows running several 
times the same application in a multi- instance 
mode (multiple running instances) even if it 
was not designed for that. 
 
C. Full Hypervisor: 
A Hypervisor is software that runs directly on 
a hardware platform, this platform is 
considered as a tool to control the operating 
system. Therefore, a secondary operating 
system can be run over the material. The 
hypervisor is a lightweight and optimized host 
kernel to execute guest operating systems that 
are adapted to a specific architecture.  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 76  
  
D. Paravirtualization: 
The Paravirtualization based on Hypervisor 
system changes virtualized OS in order to be 
adapted and optimized for this use. It allows 
virtual machines to communicate with each 
other and especially with the parent machine 
through a software bus. The paravirtualized 
machines not exploit the emulateddrivers but 
directly the physical drivers even for 
managing I/O. Secure Cloud Computing

Existing Algorithms for Cloud Security 
In Cloud Storage any organization’s or 
individual’s data is stored in and accessible 
from multiple distributed and connected 
resources that comprise a cloud. To provide 
secure communication over distributed and 
connected resou rces, encryption algorithm  
plays a vital role. It is the fundamental tool for 
protecting the data. Encryption algorithm 
converts the data into scrambled form by 
using “the key” and only user have the key to decrypt the data. In Symmetric key 
encryption, o nly one key is used to encrypt 
and decrypt the data. Another technique is 
known as asymmetric key encryption where 
two keys-  private and public keys are used. 
Public key is used for encryption and private 
key is used for decryption  
 
 
A. Data Encryption Standard (DES) 
Algorithm: 
Des Algorithm  
The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a 
block cipher. It encrypts data in blocks of size 
64 bits each. That is 64 bits of plain text goes 
as input to DES, which produces 64 bits of 
cipher text. T he same algorithm and key are 
used for encryption and decryption, with 
minor differences. The key length of this 
algorithm is 56 bits; however a 64 bits key is 
actually input. DES is therefore a symmetric 
key algorithm. ( RachnaAroraetal, 2013 )Each 
round uses a different 48- bit round key 
generated from the cipher key according to a 
predefined algorithm as shown in figure .

B. RSA Algorithm: 
RSA uses two exponents, e and d, where e is public and d is private. Let the plaintext is M and C 
is cipher text, then at encryption 
And at decryption side 
C = Me mod n 
M = Cd mod n. 
Where n is a very large number, cre ated during 
key generation process. 
 
AES Algorithm  
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), also 
known as Rijindael is used for securing 
information. AES is a symmetric block cipher 
that has been analyzed extensively and is used 
widely now-a-days.  
How AE S works in cloud environment? AES, 
symmetric key encryption algorithm is used 
with key length of 128- bits for this purpose. As 
AES is used widely now-a- days for security of 
cloud. Implementation proposal states that First, 
User decides to use cloud service s and will 
migrate his data on cloud. Then User submits 
his services requirements with Cloud Service 
Provider (CSP) and chooses best specified 
services offered by provider. When migration of 
data to the chosen CSP happens and in future 
whenever an applicat ion uploads any data on 
cloud, the data will first encrypted using AES 
algorithm and then sent to provider. Once 
encrypted, data is uploaded on the cloud, any 
request to read the data will occur after it is 
decrypted on the users end and then plain text 
data can be read by user. The plain text data is 
never written anywhere on cloud. This includes 
all types of data. The key is never stored next to 
the encrypted data, since it may compromise the 
key also. To store the keys, a physical key 
management server c an be installed in the user’s 
premises. This encryption protects data and keys 
and guarantees that they remain under user’s 
control and will never be exposed in storage or 
in transit. AES has replaced the DES as 
approved standard for a wide range of 
applications.

Blowfish Algorithm  
Blowfish is a symmetric key cryptographic 
algorithm. Blowfish encrypts 64 bit blocks with 
a variable length key of 128- 448 bits. According 
to Schneier, Blowfish was designed with the 
followings objectives in mind:  
a) Fast- Blowfish encryption rate on 32- bit  
microprocessors is 26 clock cycles per byte.  
b) Compact-  Blowfish can execute in less than 5 
kb memory.  
c) Simple- Blowfish uses only primitive 
operation - s, such as addition, XOR and table 
look up, making its design and i mplementation 
simple.  
d) Secure-  Blowfish has a variable key length 
up to maximum of 448- bit long, making it both 
secure and flexible.  
Blowfish suits applications where the key 
remains constant for a long time (e.g. 
Communications link encryption), but n ot 
where the key changes frequently (e.g. Packet 
Switching). (Rachna Aroraetal, 2013 ) 
 
Weakness Of The Existing  System 
Blowfish is slow in setting up a key, taking as lon g as 521 encryptions. 
Blowfish is not suitable for smartcards since it re quires more memory where Twofish is efficient 
for smartcards. 
Hybrid of DES and  Blowfish takes much  time to enc rypt and decrypt the file /Data 
Single encryption and decryption provides less secur ity as well as less performance. 
DES takes less space than TDES but DES is not a sec ure algorithm because after 2^56 
imagination brute force attack can crack this algori thm. 
TDES is strong algorithm but it also takes almost tw o timesmore space than DES. 
In existing systems where single level encryption a nd decryption is applied to Cloud data 
storage. Cyber criminals can easily cracked single level encryption
. 
Advantages of The Proposed System 
i. Twofish will give better performance than blowfish.  Because as compared to Blowfish, 
Twofish is a 128-bit block cipher and uses at most 1 28- bit key.  
ii. Twofish is much faster, its key setup is as fast as  1.5 encryptions where as Blowfish is 
slow in setting up a key, taking as long as 521 enc ryptions. 
iii. Twofish has no weak keys whereas Blowfish has weak keys
iv. . 
v. Hybrid of AES and Twofish takes less 
time to encrypt and decrypt the file. vi. The hybrid of AES and Twofish can 
provide more security as well as high 
performance.  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 80  
 vii. This work can also be extended to the 
use of large size of text files, images, audio 
files and video files for encryption and 
decryption viii. A system which uses multilevel 
encryption and decryption  provide more 
security for Cloud Storage 
Methodology
The methodology used is hybrid of AES,  
RSA ,&Twofish this will provide more 
security as well as high performance. ECDH 
(Elliptic curve DiffieHellman) mechanism is used for key generation. This methodology is 
used to evaluate performance of 
hybridAES+RSA and Hybrid RSA +Twofish
. 
 
PROPOSED SYSTEM 
Nowadays Cyber Criminals can easily access data sto rage. In Personal Cloud  Storage important 
data, files and records are entrusted to a third pa rty, which enables Data Security to become the 
main security issue in Cloud Computing. In Cloud St orage any organization’s or individual’s 
data is stored in and accessible from multiple distributed and connected resources that comprise a  
cloud. To provide secure communication over distrib uted and connected resources authentication 
of stored data becomes a mandatory task. 
A. Proposed System Design: 
The proposed system is d esigned to maintain 
security of text files only. This proposed system 
uses AES , RSA &Twofish algorithm to 
generate encryption when user uploaded the text 
files in Cloud Storage and inverse AES,RSA 
&Twofishalgorithm to generate decryption 
when user downloa d file from Cloud Storage, 
for increasing security. 
The proposed system is designed to maintain 
security of text files only. The proposed system design focuses on the following objectives 
which are helpful in increasing the security of 
data storage.

B. Proposed Algorithm: 
We have proposed a combination of two different
security algorithms to eliminate the security
challenges of Personal Cloud Storage. We have
taken a combination of algorithms like: AES and
Twofish. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is
a symmetric key algor ithm, in which a single key
is used for both encryption/decryption of data.
RSA is an asymmetric key algorithm, the
algorithm that uses different keys for encryption
and decryption purposes.  Whereas Twofish is
Twofish is a 128-bit block cipher and uses at  most
128-bit key. Twofish is much faster, its key setup
is as fast as 1.5 encryptions. Twofish has no weak
keys, Twofish is efficient for smartcards. 
ECDH (Elliptic curve Diffie Hellman) mechanism
can be used for key generation. 
.A user can upload Text fi le in Personal Cloud
Storage. When uploading file AES and Twofish
Encoding schemes are used to encrypt data. The
hybrid of AES and Twofish can provide more
security as well as high performance. 
 
To secure the cloud, various
encryption/decryption algorithms  are used to store
the data on cloud in encrypted form and retrieve
the data from cloud in decrypted form. 
2.1 Algorithms used 
AES 
AES treats the 128 bits of a plaintext block as 16
bytes. These 16 bytes are arranged in four
columns and four rows for proce ssing as a matrix.
AES uses 10 rounds for 128- bit keys, 12 rounds
for 192-bit keys and 14 rounds for 256- bit keys.
Each of these rounds uses a different 128- bit
round key, which is calculated from the originalIn last round, it performs three steps only,
themixcolumns step is not performed in last step.
 
TWOFISH 
Twofish is a 128- bit block cipher that accepts a
variable- length key up to 256 bits. The cipher is a
16-round Feistel network with a bijective F
function made up of four key-dependent 8-by- 8
bit S-boxes, a fixed 4-by- 4 maximum distance
separable matrix over GF(28),

IT Field And Is Being Adopted By Every 
Organization In Order To Keep Their Data All 
At One Place. So, Keeping The Data Secure Is 
An Important Aspect Of Cloud Computing. The

Abstract 
The recent development in computing, network techno logies, cloud technologies and internet 
applications has changed the landscape of cyber sec urity. As the use of information technology 
expands, so are the potential consequences of cyber -attacks, hence, information is at risk. The 
recent denial of service attacks on major internet sites has shown that no open network is 
immune from intrusions.Unfortunately the inefficien cy, inaccuracy and high false alarm rate of 
existing network security systems posed serious pro blems to vendors, ISPS, network 
Administrators, users and needs urgent redress. The  available network security designed to 
withstand attacks, diagnose and prevent intrusions is inadequate and inefficient to meet the 
growing needsthe entire world, and there is an urge nt need for new mechanism to protect cyber 
security systems. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop on efficient framework of 
intrusion detection system capable of overcoming th e apparent shortcomings of the present 
network intrusion detection systems. In this study,  the security system was developed using the 
Structured System Analysis and Design Methodology ( SSADM).The study aims at using the tools 
to design affective system that will play a key rol e in controlling intruder’s activities by detecting  
cyber based attacks, reliably and efficiently. The motivation behind this study is to involve a 
broad strategy for a unique cyber security ability to protect information, Digital assets, guard 
critical infrastructure and business ecosystem amon gst others. The result of the study will help to 
proactively address potential security by detecting  attacks and security policy violations reliably 
and efficiently in network systems. 
 
Keywords: Evolving cyber security, information is a t risk, intrusion detection system cyber-
attacks, digital assets and critical network infras tructure.  
 
1. Introduction 
In today’s world where most internet users 
have different motives and with the open 
hostile environment of the internet world, the 
information and cyber security therefore 
becomes a top priority to all organizations. To 
best protect an organization’s critical 
electronic information, Pereira F. (2000) 
observed that security at the network layer has 
grown significant in recent years. Since the 
evolution of the internet, there has been an 
increasing need for effective cyber security systems. Osuagwu (2008) [2] has referred to 
internet terrorism and fraud as the new 
pandemic that has shaken the world economy 
and has even brought down large corporations 
to ultimate collapse.Information is at the risk 
when the measurable uncertainty of loss, is 
expressed as the product of an annual threat 
occurrence rate and the value of a single time 
loss that would occur if the threat were arrived 
through. And the loss being the undesirable, 
adverse result of a risk or event that leads to  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 86  
 reduction in asset value or unplanned expense 
hence, a loss occurs only when an activated 
threat results in material damage or separation 
of property for example, a theft of data may be 
attempted (a threat but due to ignorance or 
incompetence, no loss is suffered. In other 
words, information is at risk when there is a 
loss in the following: 
1. Cyber security:  the protection of data 
from unauthorized modification, destruction 
and disclosure, either accidental or intentional 
and the protection of the computer system 
from degradation or denial of service are not 
assured. 
2. Integrity:  the state existing when data 
agree with the source from which they are 
derived and when they have not been attend, 
disclosed or destroyed, the assurance of 
accuracy, reliability and completeness are not 
protected. 
3. Confidentiality:  a concept which 
applies to cyber security that must be held 
privileged or otherwise controlled in its access 
use, and dissemination of information or 
resources is not secured, other is a risk of 
information. 
4. Vulnerability : this refers to situations 
in which a given piece of data or a cyber-
security measure can be compromised or 
rendered neutral. Vulnerability can arise at 
any point in the threat loss chain, A weak or 
inadequate cyber security measure creates a 
potential violation or loss. 
5. Availability:  the availability of 
information without any restriction by any 
means is not assured 
6 Privacy:  the right of an individual to 
determine the degree to which information 
about him or her will be shared with others, 
the right of individuals or organizations to 
control the collection, storage and 
dissemination of information about 
themselves are not assured, the information is 
at risk.According to Kabiri P. and Ghorbani 
(2005), the problem of detecting intrusions, 
anomalies, and other forms of cyber security 
abuses can be viewed as finding non-
permitted deviations deviati or security violations of the characteristic properties in 
the monitored network systems. This 
assumption is based on the fact that intruder’s 
activities must be different in some ways from 
the normal user’s activities. According to 
Kapil, Baikunth, Kotagiric, and Ashraf (2006), 
intrusion detection is still at its infancy and 
naive attackers can launch powerful attacks 
which can bring down an entire network. They 
further noted that rapid advancement in 
network technologies including higher 
bandwidths and ease of connectivity of 
wireless and mobile devices hence changed 
the focus of intrusion detection from simple 
signature matching approaches to detecting 
attacks based on analyzing contextual 
information which can be specific to 
individual networks and applications.  
 
2. Problem definition 
There exist various problems that induce the 
complexity, information and resources of 
cyber security at a risk such as intrusion and 
other security threat as discussed below: 
I    An intrusion is when anyone, usually a 
hacker, attempt to break into or misuse a 
computer system or cyber security. 
Ii   Passive attacks:  this is the passive attacks 
on cyber security which is characterized by 
the interception  
of data or communication link without 
detection. 
Iii Eavesdropping:  this is also the 
unauthorized capture of transmitted data either 
by some form of line tapping or from the 
compromising emanation broadcast by the 
electrical signals in the line, radio, optical and 
microwave signals can be similarly 
intercepted covertly. 
Iv Active attacks:  as the name suggests, the 
attacker takes active steps to interfere with the 
data being transmitted down a communication 
channel. Also the message contents can be 
deliberately changed as a result of 
modification and also the message can be 
diverted to elsewhere than its intended 
destination due to re-routing by the attackers. 
In most cases, a bogus message is sent by  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 87  
 injection of false message by attacker. In other 
words, the attacker causes the message to be 
repeated over again, perhaps many times, 
since the original message was found by the 
recipient as entirely acceptable, so too will 
any re-plays of it. The message is deleted, and 
thus never reaches its destination. And the 
message sometimes deliberately delayed by 
intruders. An attacker masquerades as an 
authorized user of the communication 
channel, and by the impersonation obtain use 
of the system as normally benefitting only 
unauthorized user.Penetration is made on 
legitimate user’s communication channels 
when the valid user is not using it, such is 
when he/she has remained logged-on during 
the lunch break, this is as a result of between 
lines.Also the problems include, the accidental 
threats to the data being transmitted and the 
communication channel in use which can be 
as damaging as any of the deliberate attacks, 
such as message loss, message 
duplication,sequence errors. The question is 
how then, do we protect our cyber security 
hence, the resources and information areat 
risk. 
 
3. Motivation: 
The motivation behind this study is to involve 
a broad strategy and base practices for 
protecting our cyber security which include a 
need to implement intrusion detection system 
(IDS),in other to monitor inbound and 
outbound traffic in the network. Hence, IDS 
can identify suspicious and malicious traffic 
and a threat which hassomehow managed to 
bypass the firewall. In addition, IDS will be 
able to detect intrusion that originate from 
inside the network. All these will harness the 
unique cyber security ability to protect digital 
assets, guard critical infrastructure and 
business ecosystem amongst others. Hence 
information is the most valuable resources of 
an organization. Therefore the security checks 
on risk exposures should be assured to avoid 
co-operate failure. 
 
4. Security Checks and Protection: i. Cryptology:  A most useful technique 
to improve the security of transmitted data is 
encryption. The data encryption is the 
performance of complex mathematical 
transformations that make any data 
unintelligible to an outside party. These 
transformations are made using algorithm-the 
mathematical formula and a cryptolographic 
key, which is a specialdata item, normally 
kept secret, used as an input into the algorithm 
along with the data itself. 
 
ii. Physical and procedural security:  
The physical security of all cyber components, 
but especially those parts connecting the 
various elements or to other systems 
(network) is vital to the overall security effort. 
You must ensure the following: 
a. Access: both physical and logical 
access to all components of the system must 
be strictly controlled. 
b. Any communication link within the 
site should travel along known routes within 
sealed trucking. Such trucking should be 
transparent and visible along its entire length 
so that staff can see immediately if the cabling 
within has been tempered with regular 
inspection of the trucking should be carried 
out by staff technically qualified to recognize 
any signs of interference. Junction boxes 
should be physically secured, and access to 
them restricted. 
c. Lines into sites should if possible 
come along underground routes. Overhead 
cables should drop to the site along invisible 
route and be inspected regularly for signs of 
tampering. 
Wires must not be labeled with their roles, 
especially sensitivecircuitsreferences should 
be made to Map and circuit diagram held 
under approximately secure conditions. 
d. Careful control must be exercised over 
the routing of data transmissions. Some routes 
will be inherently more secure and others will 
have had a greater security effort applied to 
them. Likewise, some will be inherently 
insecure. It is sensible to direct the more  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 88  
 sensitive or valuable traffic along the more 
sensitive routes. 
e. Make certain routes one way-
“notarization” 
f. All maintenance work on 
communication linkage must be authorized in

solutions for cyber security problems is the 
intrusions detection, which the frame work 
will be discovered in the subsequent pages. 
 
5. Literature review: 
The fields of cyber security and intrusion 
detection has been around since late 1980s, 
since then, various strategies such as 
association rules, naive Bayes classifier, 
clustering, genetic algorithms and others have 
been applied to detect intrusions. 
This study was also compared with that of 
G.U,Y., mccallum, A. and Townsley, D. 
(2005). In their research titled “detecting 
Anomalies in network Trafficusing maximum 
entropy Estimation” which describes the use 
of maximum entropy principle for detecting 
anomalies in the network traffic. 
Lee et al (1998) introduced data mining 
approaches for detecting intrusion, and the 
data mining proaches for intrusion detection 
include association rules and frequent episode 
which are based on building classifiers by 
discovering relevant pattern of program and 
use behavior.According to portnoy, L. Eskin, 
E.Stolfo, S. (2001), Data clustering methods 
such as the K-means and the Fuzzy C-means 
have beenapplied extensively for intrusion 
detection. And one of the main drawbacks of 
the clustering technique is that it is based on 
calculating numeric distance between the 
observations and hence, the observation must 
be numeric.  
Osuagwu (2008) [1,2,3] has cited security 
intelligence reports on cyber-crime wave 
around the world are worrisome, and also 
stated that, unfortunately, many small businesses, and even large organizations, do 
not know how to properly protect their 
sensitive data, thus living the door open to 
criminals. 
According to Osuagwu (2009), one important 
case study which illustrates how dangerous 
cyber-criminality can be, is the United States 
Anthrax crime. Though, the anthrax crime was 
traditionally physical in its outlook (through 
the chemical labs and delivery through the 
post offices of the US), but the crime-which 
later became a monstrous cyber security to the 
United States- was indeed originated in the 
cyber space using the computer as a major 
tool. Later investigations reveled that all the 
planning of the Anthrax phenomena took 
place on the internet and collaborative local 
Area Network (LAN), citing also, according 
to an FBI investigation officer on the Anthrax 
episode, computers played a major role in 
perpetuating the crime. sThe biennial 
Department of trade and industry (DTI) 
security Breaches survey reports that 62% of 
UK businesses had a computer security 
incident in the 2006. These statistics may 
underestimate the real situation as many 
organizations or individuals may be unaware 
that the security of the system has been 
compromised. The information is at risk. 
 
6.Framework for Intrusion Detection 
System 
The intrusion detection system draw inference 
from Airport security model and network 
virtualization similar to this model, is the 
framework that represents a sequence strategy 
based on ensuring confidentiality, data 
authentication,privacy, integrity, availability 
etc of data and services over a network. 
Fig 1. Below gives the representation of the 
framework.

The purpose of using the model is to reduce 
computational complexity and the overall time 
required to detect anomalous outcomes. The 
time required to detect an intrusive outcome is 
significant and can be reduced by eliminating 
the communication overhead among different 
levels. This can be achieved by making the 
levels autonomous and self-sufficient to alert 
and block an attack without the need of a 
central decision-maker. Every level in the 
system is trained separately and the deployed 
sequentially. In this study, three levels are 
defined that corresponds to the three attack 
groups.They are dos level, R2L level, and 
U2R level. Each level is then separately 
trained with a small set of relevant features. 
This implies that feature selection is very significant for the leveled strategy. In order to 
make the levels independent, some features 
may be present in more than one level.The 
levels essentially act as filters that alert and 
block any anomalous connection, thereby 
eliminating the need of further processing at 
subsequent levels enabling quick response to 
intrusion. The effect of such a sequence of 
levels is that the anomalous outcome are 
identified and alerted as soon as they are 
detected. 
Another purpose of the leveled strategy is to 
improve the speed of operation of the system. 
This results in significant performance 
improvement during both the training and the 
testing of the system

8. Result and Discussion 
The result of this study shows that the 
institution detection system can be very 
effective in detecting the Dos, the U2R, and 
the R2L attacks. Feature selection for each 
level enhances the performance of the entire 
system.The runtime performance of the 
framework is comparable with other methods; 
however, the time required to train the model 
is slightly higher.It is also observed that 
feature selection not only decreases the time 
required to test an instance, but it also 
increases the accuracy of attack detection. 
This is because using more features than 
required can generate superfluous rules often 
resulting in fitting irregularities in the data, 
which can misguide classification.Finally, the 
system can be used for performing analysis on 
attacks because the attack category can be 
inferred from the level at which the attack is 
detected. 
 9. Conclusion  
Information is the most valuable resource of 
an organization. Therefore, the cyber security 
checks on risk exposures should be assured to 
avoid cooperate failure;Irrespective of 
intrusion detection system, other control 
measures should be considered, such as:-
backup software, backup hardware (duplexes 
configuration) effective operational 
procedures and equipment and devices to 
prevent system disaster.In most cases, other 
control measures such as the use of forensics 
tools are considered, this is the scientific 
collection, recovery presentation, legal 
analysis and presentation as data held or 
retrieved from the cyber system storage media 
in such a way that the information can be used 
as evidence in a court of law. It is also the 
application of computer investigation and 
analysis techniques in the interest of 
determining potential legal evidence. The  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 91  
 evidence obtained may then be explained and 
preserved to those who will make the ultimate 
decision about how to proceed in the criminal 
investigation. This is necessary to investigate 
a cyber-crime about the threat and the truth to 
be carried out through the computer forensics 
tools. 
In otherworld’s, the framework was 
introduced, as intrusion detection which 
addresses three critical factors that affect the 
large scale deployment of present anomaly. 
The three factors are:  (1) Limited attack detection coverage. 
(2) Large number of false alarms and  
(3) Inefficiency in operation. 
The study observed that leveled framework 
can be used to build efficient intrusion 
detection system for cyber security system. 
The framework also identify the type of 
attack, hence, specific intrusion response 
mechanism can be initiated which helps to 
minimize the impact of the attack

Abstract 
Many hospitals employ the manual hospital managemen t system in which all their processes are done 
manually. The manual system has a lot of challenges ranging from improper record keeping, waste of time 
and effort and inadequate care of the patients. The automated Hospital Management System is a computer 
based system which facilitates managing the functio ning of the hospital and makes the whole functionin g 
paperless while overcoming the challenges faced by the manual system. This paper develops a complete 
and secured automated Hospital Management System wh ich automates all the processes in the system 
ranging from the registration of the patient, lab i nvestigation, admission and drug dispensary. This w as 
achieved by developing an application in java calle d the IntegratedHospital Information Management 
System which automates the entire hospital processes . In order to prevent unauthorized access to patients’  
records, the records are encrypted when they are ge nerated and only decrypted by authorized personnel.  
A second application called the Simulated Patient D ata Software was developed for the encryption and 
decryption of patients’ medical records. The result  of this research work is a complete automation of a 
Hospital Management System which is secured . 
  
1. Introduction     
Most hospitals employ the manual hospital 
management system in which all their processes 
starting from registration to admission and 
dispensary of drugs are done manually. The manual 
method of hospital management faces a lot of 
challenges ranging from improper record keeping, 
waste of time, effort and money, lack of job 
satisfaction on the part of the nurses and attendan ts 
and even doctors and inadequate care of the 
patients.It is alarming that in a paper-based 
environment, medical mistakes frequently approach 
40%, of which 39% are made at the point of 
prescription, 12% by transcription errors and 11% 
in dispensing Wicks et al (2006). 
An automated Hospital Management System 
(HMS) is a computer or web based system 
whcih facilitates managing the functioning of the 
hospital or any medical set up. This system or 
software will help in making the whole 
functioning paperless. It integrates all the 
information regarding patients, doctors, staff, 
hospital administrative details etc. into one 
software. It has sections for various professionals 
that make up a hospital. Some hospitals now employ the automated hospital 
management system in which their processes are 
automated but they fail to secure the patients’ 
medical records since they travel through 
networks. Communication of health related 
information has to be strictly private and 
confidential to protect patient privacy. The data 
sent over the network and wireless transmission is 
prone to different types of attack such as 
eavesdropping, sending false values or replay of 
previous data. Medical professionals have to be 
certain that the data are not tampered in transit o r 
at a point of origin as proper diagnosis requires 
accurate data.  
As the patients’ medical records travel across 
networks, it is pertinent that they are protected 
against unauthorized access which might intercept 
the data along the way.In view of this, the patient s’ 
medical records are encrypted as they travel across  
the networks. This encryption is done by using the 
symmetric key encryption algorithm which encrypts 
the patients’ medical records as they are generated  
and only decrypts them when they are needed. This 
ensures that unauthorized users are denied access.

 2. Related Work 
Ahmed et al presented a paper titled ‘A Hospital 
Resource and Patient Management System Based 
on Real Time Data Capture and Intelligent Decision 
Making’. The paper highlights the shortcomings of 
existing hospital information systems and proposes 
a location, identification and communication system  
that is able to overcome some of the inadequacies o f 
existing systems and improve the efficiency and 
throughput of the various units of the hospital set up. 
Their system was based on Radio Frequency 
Identification (RFID) and wireless sensor network-
based location and information management 
framework and the technology that would allow 
hospital assets, personnel and patients to be track ed 
in real time for the purpose of optimizing operatio ns 
in all aspects of the daily activities of hospitals . The 
RFID-based system is linked to a Wireless Body 
Area Network (WBAN) which collects 
physiological information about a patient and opens  
new possibilities for a remote patient care. 
Ahmed et al identified their challenges to be 
assuring hardware fidelity, software functionality,  
data reliability and overall long-term system 
dependability. The major gap in this research 
work is the lack of provision of security 
architecture for the work. The patients’ 
physiological data are collected and sent through 
networks but no security measure is put in place 
to safeguard the patients’ medical records as they 
travel through the networks. 
The work presented by Daiping et al on ‘Study on 
Information system of Health Care Services 
Management in Hospital’ reviews the Health 
Information Systems (HIS) which are widely used 
in many hospitals in China mainly to provide 
easier and faster way for daily medical tasks. The 
work proposes Hospital Services Management 
System (HSMS) which aims at improving quality 
of services, identifying cost reduction areas, 
analyses and evaluates health care services. 
Christopher Bain’s research work ‘Developing 
Effective Hospital Management Information 
System’ focuses more on the needs of hospital 
manager and the ecosystem in which it operates, 
the internal and external environment shaping 
factors which bears an impact or association on 
daily hospital activities and decision making process that the hospital manager has to go 
through in each situations. Some of the major 
challenges identified are high demand pressure, 
greater customer satisfaction level and low profit 
margins. 
Hubner et al presented a paper on the ‘Specificatio n 
of a Reference Model for the Domain Layer of a 
Hospital Information System. The paper aimed at 
creating a reference data model that will serve as a 
generic starting point for any new Hospital 
Information System development projects so costs 
involved in studying and analyzing current state 
and coming up with gaps analysis and additional 
requirements can be significantly reduced. The 
paper again did not consider the security of 
patients’ medical records. 
Olusanya et al’s work on ‘Design and 
Implementation of Hospital Management System 
using Java’ provides the benefits of streamlined 
operations, enhanced administration and control, 
superior patient care, strict cost control and 
improved profitability. The system used java as 
the front end software which is an Object 
Oriented Programming language and has 
connectivity with the back end software. 
Digvijay et al’s work on ‘Hospital Management 
System’ dealt with the computerization of the 
front office management of hospital to develop a 
software which is user friendly, simple, fast and 
cost effective. It deals with the collection of 
patient’s information, diagnosis details etc. These  
functions were performed manually before but the 
function of the new system is to register and store  
patient and doctor details and retrieve these detai ls 
when required and to manipulate these details 
meaningfully. 
 
 3.n Methodology and System Analysis 
The existing system is a complete manual system 
where all the processes are done by hand. The 
system has a lot of paper work. When a patient 
visits the hospital, he obtains a card at which poin t 
a file is opened for him. He goes to see the doctor  
who then decides what type of treatment that is 
good for the patient. He can send the patient to th e 
lab for further investigation after which he 
prescribes drugs or further investigation for the 
patient. All information is entered in the patient’ s  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 95  
 file and the file is kept in the file cabinet. When  
the patient comes to the hospital again, the file i s 
retrieved for him to see the doctor. 
The dataflow diagram of the existing system is 
shown in figure 1. 
The proposed system is a completely automated 
system where all the patients’ records are kept in t he 
computer. It is a complete paperless system. When a 
sick patient visits the hospital, he goes to the 
registration center where his personal information is 
collected. The patient’s biometrics are also taken 
and kept in the computer. A file is created for the  
patient and kept in the computer system. At this 
point, the patient goes to see the doctor who 
examines him and prescribes treatment for him. The 
doctor can send him to the lab for further 
investigation. The result of the lab investigation is 
sent to the server where the doctor can have access  
to it. All the computers in the hospital are connec ted through a network. A local area network is used to 
connect all the computers in the hospital and a wid e 
area network is used to connect to the computers in  
the other branches of the hospital in different 
locations.  The doctor sees the patient’s medical 
records in his computer and proffers a solution to 
the patient’s problem. When the patient visits the 
hospital again, he will go the registration centre 
where his file will be uploaded for the doctor to s ee 
irrespective of the computer he is using, this solv es 
the problem of having to look for the patient’s fil e 
in the manual method in the existing system.    
 Since the patients’ medical records travel across 
networks, it is very important to safeguard the 
patients’ medical records. This is done by 
encrypting the records as they travel through the 
networks and decrypting them at the other 
end.The dataflow diagram of the proposed system 
is shown in figure 2

 The automation of the hospital was done using the 
java language.  The software was developed in 
Java because of its web based features and its 
portability The java language was used to develop 
an application called the Integrated Hospital 
Information Management System which performs 
several hospital functions ranging from 
registration of new patients, in-patient admission 
master list, out-patient admission master list, dru g 
inventory, hospital discharge reports, medical 
staff information and experts information. The 
database was created using MY SQL where the 
records are stored. A second application was also 
developed in java called Simulated Patient Data 
Software (SPDS). This software is responsible for 
the encryption and decryption of the patients’ 
medical records. 
In the encryption, the original text called the 
plaintext is encrypted using an encryption 
algorithm, to generate the encrypted text called 
the cipher text that can only be read if decrypted. 
The encryption scheme uses a pseudo-random 
encryption key generated by the algorithm. In the 
symmetric key scheme, the encryption and 
decryption keys are the same, thus 
communicating parties must have the same key 
before they can achieve secret communication. 
The encrypted text which is the cipher text is 
decrypted in the server by only authorized users 
using the decryption key which is the same key as 
the encrypted key. 
In the security architecture, each patient is assig ned 
a unique ID called Patient ID (PID) which is 
generated using random number generation. The 
patient id generated is automatically encrypted.  
The patients’ data are simulated with the 
Simulated Patient Data Software (SPDS) and sent 
to the Patient Data Acquisition Centre (PDAC) 
through wireless connection for consolidation and 
further transmission to the Central Hospital 
Monitoring System (CHMS) for processing and 
follow up by the medical care givers.  
 
4. Results and Discussion 
The Encryption/Decryption Algorithm  1.) Create the instance of javax.crypto.Cipher.
 Cipher cipher = 
Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"); 
2.) Create the instance of 
sun.misc.BASE64Decoder. 
 BASE64Decoder d64 = new BASE64Decoder(); 
3.) Decode encryption key using 
decodeBuffer method of 
sun.misc.BASE64Decoder which will return a 
byte array. 
 byte[]b = 
d64.decodeBuffer(ENCRYPTION_KEY); 
4.) Now create 
javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec object using the 
key byte array and "AES". 
 SecretKeySpec key = new 
SecretKeySpec(strPassword.getBytes(), "AES"); 
5.) Now create 
javax.crypto.spec.IvyParameterSpec object using 
your IV  spec. 
 AlgorithmParameterSpec paramSpec = new 
IvParameterSpec (strPassword.getBytes()); 
6.) Call the init method of Cipher Instance 
using encryption mode, key spec (created at 
step 4), IVParameter Spec(created at step 5). 
 cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key, 
paramSpec); 
7.) Call doFinal method of Cipher by passing 
the byte array of data which needs to be 
encrypted. 
 encrypted = cipher.doFinal(input.getBytes()); 
8.) Now encode the encrypted data using 
sun.misc.BASE64Encoder.  
 output =  new 
BASE64Encoder().encode(encrypted) 
 
Note About Key Size: 
The AES algorithm requires that the key size must 
be 16bytes. So if you provide a key whose size is 
not equal to 16bytes, a 
java.security.InvalidKeyException will be thrown. 
This algorithm uses cipher which is a sprat class i n 
the javax.crypto package that is specially 
designed for encryption and decryption. It 
provides the functionality of a cryptographic 
cipher for encryption and decryption. To create a 
cipher object, the application calls the cipher’s  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 99  
 getInstance method and passes the name of the 
requested transformation to it. The cipher 
getInstance method employs a random length 
padding which prevents an attacker from knowing 
the exact length of the plaintext message. This 
strengthens the algorithm because it prevents the 
cryptanalyst from using predictability to find 
known plaintext that can aid in breaking the 
encryption. 
The base64Decoder converts the base64 encoded 
data into binary data and returns a byte array. The  
base64Decoder is responsible for displaying the 
encrypted files in the form of a ciphertext. 
The algorithm uses a 16 bit key which is entered by  
the user and encrypted. A secret key spec and an 
algorithm parameter spec is created which 
validates the key input to make sure that it is the  
right key for the Advanced Encryption Standard 
algorithm to take place. 
An init method which is found in the cipher class i s 
called upon which ties the key to the encryption. 
The init method checks that the key supplied 
tallies with the key for the encryption. 
The do final method is also a method inside the 
cipher class which is the final step of encryption.  
It gets the users input and converts it to byte 
which it stores in the byte array. 
The Encode which is a method inside the 
base64Encoder displays the encrypted output. 
This algorithm uses a 16-bit key and therefore the 
number of potential patterns to be created is quite  
large and this makes it difficult to break the code  
and descramble the contents. 
This algorithm uses block ciphers which encrypts 
the data one fixed-size block at a time. The block 
cipher spreads a single bit of the plaintext across  
the entire encrypted block. Modes are employed 
in the encryption to combine the block cipher with 
the plaintext. The cipher block chaining (CBC) is 
the type of mode used in this encryption. CBC 
combines the previous block of cipher text with the next block of plaintext before encrypting it. A  
random value – an initialization vector is applied 
to the first block before it is encrypted. This 
chaining mechanism means the encryption of each 
block depends on the encryption of all previous 
blocks. CBC helps detect modifications to the 
cipher text. 
The algorithm performs key distribution by using a 
public key to encrypt a randomly generated secret 
key. Then the recipient uses the corresponding 
private key to decrypt it. 
Since the algorithm employs a random length 
padding (AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding), it prevents 
an attacker from knowing the exact length of the 
plaintext message. This strengthens the algorithm 
because it prevents the cryptanalyst from using 
predictability to find known plaintext that can aid  
in breaking an encryption. 
Padding is used to prepare for the encryption using  
a specification such as PKCS5. This is achieved 
by appending random material to the message to 
make it long enough for the primitive. This 
padding scheme aims to ensure that the attacker 
cannot manipulate the plaintext to exploit the 
mathematical structure of the primitive that 
breaking the padding scheme is as hard as solving 
the hard problem underlying the primitive. 
In the PKCS5 (Public Key Cryptographic Standards 
5) padding used in this encryption, the last block 
is padded with integers, each of which is the 
number of bytes used to pad the message. The 
PKCS5 is used by padding with bytes all of the 
same value as the number of padding bytes. The 
input is padded with a padding string of between 
1 and 8 bytes to make the total length an exact 
multiple of 8 bytes. The value of each byte of the 
padding string is set to the number of bytes added: 
i.e 8 bytes of value 0x08, 7 bytes of value 0x07, 6  
bytes of value 0x06, 5 bytes of value 0x05, 4

5.Conclusion  
A secured automated Hospital Management 
System has been presented. It has been shown that 
at the manual hospital management system wastes 
a lot of time and effort, involves a lot of paper 
work and is prone to many errors. On the other 
hand, an automated Hospital Management System 
overcomes all the short comings of the manual 
Hospital Management System and is completely 
paperless. This is because all the patients’ 
information are entered into the computer and all 
the computers are connected through a network 
and therefore the doctors can access patients’ 
information from anywhere in the hospital.  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 103  
 The patients’ medical records are secured by 
encrypting the records. This was achieved by 
using a 16 bit symmetric encryption algorithm. This encryption employs a 16 bit password to 
encrypt the patients’  
 
 
 
medical information. The encryption algorithm 
uses the same key for the encryption and the 
decryption. The patients’ records are decrypted by entering the same key only by authorized 
personnel. In this way the patients’ medical 
records are safeguarded from unauthorized access

Abstract 
Here, we portray a rule-based machine translation s ystem that translates English sentences to the Igbo  
language. This work was evaluated with respect to a dequacy, a measure of the quantity of information 
existent in the original text that the translated t ext contains. It indicates whether the output is a correct 
translation of the original sentence in a sense tha t the right meaning is communicated. An analysis 
revealed that adequacy was poor for sentences that contain words that exhibit ambiguity. The errors 
originated from the fact that correct meanings of a mbiguous words were not selected based on the 
context. Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is an impo rtant technique for many natural language 
processing (NLP) applications such as grammatical a nalysis, content analysis, information retrieval an d 
machine translation.  A further study (on a few Lan guage Translators like the Google Translate) of the  
architecture of the translation system showed it ha s no built-in module for word sense disambiguation.  
This accounts for the poor adequacy. A word-sense m odel was developed and incorporated into the MT 
system to disambiguate sentences before passing it to the translator. The  model was implemented using  
JSP, a technology for building and deploying web ap plications in Java as the front end and MySQL as a 
backend. The model was tested on various previously  translated sentences that contain ambiguous words.  
The level of adequacy increased from 32% to more tha n 60%.

Introduction 
In the present day, we live in an increasingly 
globalized and incorporated world where much 
information is generated in various fields. However , 
since most of this information is in English, it 
remains out of reach to a large number of people 
who do not speak the language. As a consequence, 
there is an increasing demand for developing a 
means of  translating from one language to another 
to enable efficient communication across cultures. 
Because human translation is expensive, time 
consuming and always in short supply, developing  
and deploying machine translation applications has 
become imperative for dealing with the problem of information inequalities created by multilingualism . 
Machine translation is the use of computers to 
automate some or all of the process of translating 
from one language to another [1]. Research 
organizations and government agencies now 
develop tools for automatic translation of text in 
order to achieve wider outreach and bridge the gap 
in language diversity [2].  
Igbo is a language in Nigeria. A significant 
percentage of Igbo speakers cannot access 
information due to the fact information is mostly 
created in English. Developing a machine 
translation system that will efficiently translate  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 105  
 English language to Igbo to bridge this information  
gap has become a matter of absolute necessity in 
modern times. Here, we describe a rule -based 
English to Igbo Machine Translation System 
developed to achieve the objective of efficiently 
translating between these languages automatically. The human language is ambiguous because many 
words can be interpreted in multiple ways 
depending on the context. Ambiguity occurs when 
a word can have two or more different meanings 
or senses. Table 1 below illustrates this
: 
 
Translation ambiguity occurs when a word in the 
source language can be rendered in more than one 
way in the target language [3]. When performing 
translation it is necessary to select the right mea ning 
of an ambiguous word, it ensures that the intended 
meaning in the source language is conveyed in the 
target language. The task of assigning the correct or 
appropriate meaning to a given word in a text or 
discourse is called word sense disambiguation [4]. It 
is the computational identification of the meaning 
of words in context. The context of an ambiguous 
word is determined by the neighboring words. This 
is referred to as local or sentential context. In 
machine translation, adequacy is the measure of the  
quantity of information existent in the original te xt 
that the translated text contains; it indicates whe ther 
the output is a correct translation of the original  
sentence in the sense that the right meaning is communicated. For adequacy to be achieved in 
machine translation, a word must be translated 
based on the context in which it is used. Word sens e 
disambiguation therefore plays critical role in 
automatic translation of text. 
The objective of this research is to model a langua ge 
processor that can computationally determine the 
sense of an ambiguous word that is activated by its  
use in a particular context in a given English 
sentence before it is passed to the rule-based 
English to Igbo machine translator. The aim is to 
achieve significant improvement in translation 
quality. 
A number of approaches have been proposed for 
WSD [5,6]. Fig.1 is a diagram showing the different  
approaches. Overlapped-based approach was 
adopted in developing our model.

1.1 Rationale for the Study 
Absence of trained English to Igbo language 
translators is making Igbo speakers unable to 
participate in abundant business opportunities 
available in the online community and proper 
integration in the emerging Information society. 
Large proportions of the population do not speak 
or hear English that is a global language for 
business. Developing automatic machine 
translator for English to Igbo language will be a 
major boost to economic activities in the territory  
of Igbo nation. 
 
2 Summary of Literature 
[7] had posited that translation is critical for 
addressing information inequalities. A study 
conducted by Common Sense Advisory on behalf 
of Translators without Borders finds that 
translation is critical for the public health, 
political stability, and social wellbeing of Africa n 
nations [8]. 
The work of translation was originally carried out 
by human translators. At a point the supply of 
translation services could no longer keep pace 
with the demand for translated content, moreover 
human translation is costly, time consuming and 
inadequate for addressing the real-time needs of 
businesses to serve multilingual prospects, 
partners and  
  
customers. The inherent limitations of human 
translation made the search for an alternative mean s 
of translation paramount. The search led to the 
discovery of what is known today as machine 
translation or computer assisted translation. 
Machine Translation is the use of computers to 
automate some or all of the process of translating 
from one language to another [8]. 
Machine Translation systems (MT) can be 
classified according to their core methodology. 
Under this classification, two main paradigms can 
be found:  
The rule-based approach and the corpus-based 
approach .  
Within the rule based paradigm three approaches 
can be distinguished: Direct, Transfer and 
Interlingua [9] [10]. Rule-based systems are based 
on linguistically-informed foundations requiring 
extensive morphological, syntactic and semantic 
knowledge. Translation rules are created manually, 
demanding significant multilingual and linguistic 
expertise. Therefore, rule-based systems require 
large initial investment and maintenance for every 
language pair [11]. 
 
 
 
2.1 Limitations of Study  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 107  
 Machine Translators based on word sense 
disambiguation methodology has not been fully 
compared with other methods of automatic 
machine translation. Again the authors need to 
develop an online open access portal to critique 
the model for further refinement. We are unable to 
do this now until a proper refinement is achieved 
and the final version tested and attested for full 
functionality. 
 
3 Methodology 
The methodology adopted in this technical paper 
is overlapped-based model for Word Sense 
Disambiguation. A number of approaches have 
been proposed for WSD [5,6]. Fig.1 is a diagram 
showing the different approaches.  
 
3.1Task Description 
Let W (w1, w2...wn) be the set of words left in the 
sentence after removing stop words. For each 
word wi in W, verify that wi is ambiguous by 
checking its sense indicator in a table. If the sen se 
indicator of wi shows that it is ambiguous, then 
there will be multiple senses S of wi. The overlap 
for each sense of wi is computed. Thus,  the sense 
that has the maximum overlap is the most 
probable sense [12]. 
 
3.2 Algorithm 
i. Tokenize the sentence into word and store 
each token in an array 
ii. Open stopwords table in database 
iii. Each token in array is searched for in the 
table, if found to be a stopword, it is removed 
from the array. Repeat until all stopwords are 
removed from array. 
iv. An array of remaining words is left. 
iv. Each token in the sentence is searched for in the 
lexicon table, if found the sense value is checked.   
If the sense value is “ps”, it is polysemous, 
then 
v. Open wsd table and retrieve first_sense, 
first_sense_relatedwords, second_sense,   
second_sense_relatedwords. Each sense related 
words are stored in separate arrays.  First_sense_relatedwordsarray and 
second_sense_relatedwordsarray respectively. 
vii. Each word in 
First_sense_relatedwordsarray is compared with 
the words in remaining_wordsarray obtained in 
step iv. If words are found, the 
first_sense_overlap_number is incremented by 1. 
This process is repeated until all the 
first_sense_relatedwordsarray content are 
compared with remaining_wordsarray. 
viii. Each word in 
second_sense_relatedwordsarray is compared 
with the remaining wordsarray. If a word is found 
the second_sense_overlap_number is incremented 
by 1. This process is repeated until all the 
second_sense_relatedwordsarray content are 
compared with remaining_wordsarray. 
ix. The overlap number for first_sense and 
second_sense are compared. If  
first_sense_overlap_number>second_sense_overl
ap_number, then first sense is selected as the most  
appropriate sense, otherwise the second sense is 
selected as the appropriate. 
x. The selected sense is used to replace the 
original token in the array. 
 
4 System Architecture and Modules 
GUI (for graphic user interface) creates the 
interface which is displayed for the user to enter 
the sentence to  be disambiguated before being 
translated. The output of the disambiguation and 
translation is also presented  to the user through 
this interface. 
The proposed System Architecture is presented in 
Fig. 2. It has seven main components –the GUI, 
sanitizer, tokenizer, caseConverter, 
stopWordsRemover, disambiguator, assembler.  
The Sanitizer formats the input sentence and 
removes all punctuation marks. Tokenization is 
the breaking up of raw text or sentence into 
words. This function is performed by the 
tokenizer. The input sentence is broken up at this 
point into words. It recognizes a word whenever a 
space is encountered which signifies the end of 
the word. The tokens are stored in an array. 
  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 108  
 
 
 
The Case Converter converts all the tokens to 
lowercase.  
StopWordsRemover removes stop words from the 
array of tokens.  
Disambiguator performs the task of selecting the 
correct sense for the ambiguous word present in the  
sentence. The original ambiguous word is replaced 
with the selected sense based on the context. The 
Assembler recreates the sentence from the tokens. 
The sentence now contains the correct sense for the  
ambiguous word. 
 
 
 
 5 System Implementation 
The database tables were created in MySQL. The 
word sense disambiguation engine which applies a 
collection of computational rules to select the 
appropriate sense for an ambiguous word based on 
context was developed using JSP and integrated 
with the rule based English to Igbo Automatic 
Translator which was also developed in JSP. The 
translation interface is shown in Fig. 4. 
After entry of the English sentence, the user click s the 
Translate button; the disambiguated sentence and 
the Igbo equivalent are generated and displayed. 
The translate button caption changes to More as 
shown in the figure below

 5.1 Test and Evaluation  
Translation quality is judged along two key 
dimensions namely; adequacy and fluency. 
Adequacy is the extent to which the meaning 
conveyed by the human translation is also 
conveyed by the machine translation output being 
evaluated. It is the measure of the quantity of 
information existent in the original text that the 
translated text contains; it indicates whether the 
output is a correct translation of the original 
sentence in a sense that the meaning is 
transferred. Fluency on the other hand is the 
degree to which the translation is well formed 
according to the grammar of the target language; 
fluency measures the extent of readability and 
understandability.  
 
 
 
  
6 Conclusion 
This paper has concentrated on the design of a 
system that can computationally determine the 
sense of an ambiguous word that is activated by 
its use in a particular context in a given English 
sentence. The design was successfully 
implemented. A significant improvement in the 
level of adequacy was observed when the system 
was integrated with a rule-based English to Igbo 
automatic translator.  
Word sense disambiguation is therefore critical to 
achieving accuracy in automatic translation 
systems. Any language translator that fails to 
embed WSD in the translation process will 
produce inaccurate translation. We therefore 
recommend its integration in all translation 
models for all languages.

Abstract 
An interface is a device or program enabling a user  to communicate with a computer. In the 
modern computing world, many new-generation databas e applications require intelligent 
interface to support efficient and effective intera ctions between the users of the database and the 
database itself. Our objective is to develop a doma in-independence, intelligent platform which 
employs semantic matching technique to convert natur al language query to SQL using dictionary 
and set of production rules. There is an overwhelmi ng need for users of the database who are 
non-experts to query relational databases in their natural language instead of working with the 
values of the attributes, and this is the factor be hind our motivation. Using object oriented 
analysis and design method as well as some level of  artificial intelligence methodology; this 
platform will be achieved by the mapping of natural  language queries to SQL rather than 
building normal query.

I. Introduction 
An interface may be seen as a device or 
program for connecting two items of hardware 
or software so that they can be operated jointly 
or communicate with each other. Database 
Management System is a collection of 
interrelated data and set of programs to access 
those data. Database systems are designed to 
manage large bodies of information. A database 
management system (DBMS) interface is a user 
interface which allows for the ability to input 
queries to a database without using the query 
language itself. A DBMS interface could be a 
web client, a local client that runs on a desktop 
computer, or even a mobile app. To access the 
information in the database, we should have the 
knowledge of Structured Query Language 
(SQL). Only those users who have the 
knowledge of these languages can access the 
data or information. An end user normally 
doesn’t know SQL. So in order to access the 
information, a graphical user interface has to be 
used.  This graphical user interface requires 
some basic training for using the system. With 
the help of this interface, the end user can query 
the system in natural language like English and 
can see the result in same language. This gives the idea of Natural Language Interface to 
Database (NLIDB).  With the help of this 
interface, the end user can query the system in 
natural language like English, and can see the 
result in same language. NLIDB system is 
proposed as a solution to the problem for 
accessing information in a simple way, allowing 
ideally any type of users, mainly inexperienced 
ones; to retrieve information from a database 
(DB) using natural language (NL). It is a type of 
computer human interface. Natural Language 
interface to database is basically a field of 
natural language processing. This is the user-
friendly interface through which users can 
interact with the database. 
 
Natural language Processing  
Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of 
computer science, artificial intelligence, and 
linguistics concerned with the interactions 
between computers and human (natural) 
languages.  
As such, NLP is related to the area of human–
computer interaction. Natural language 
understanding is the major challenge for any 
NLP that is enabling the computers to extracts  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 114  
 meanings from natural language query. The 
foundation of NLP lies in number of disciplines 
like computer and information science, 
linguistics, mathematics, electrical and 
electronics engineering, artificial intelligence, 
robotics psychology, agriculture, weather 
forecasting, etc 
 
 Major Task of NLP  
NLP is a technique which makes the computer 
understands the languages naturally used by 
humans. The following is a list of some of the 
most commonly researched tasks in NLP  
 
• Speech segmentation:  Given a sound clip of a 
person or people speaking, separate it into 
words.  
• Topic segmentation and recognition:  Given 
a chunk of text, separate it into segments each of 
which is devoted to a topic, and identify the 
topic of the segment.  
• Word segmentation:  Separate a chunk of 
continuous text into separate words. For a 
language like English, this is fairly trivial, sinc e 
words are usually separated by spaces.  
• Speech Recognition:  This is a process of 
mapping acoustic speech signals to a set of 
words. The difficulties arise due to wide 
variations in the pronunciations of words.  
• Natural language generation:  It converts the 
information from the databases into readable 
human native language.  
• Machine translation:  It translates text from 
one native language to another automatically.  
• Natural Language Interfaces to Databases:  
It allows querying a database using natural 
language sentences. It is a system that allows 
the user to access information stored in a 
database by typing requests expressed in some 
natural language.  
• Information Retrieval (IR):  This is 
concerned with identifying documents relevant 
to user’s query. Indexing, word sense 
disambiguation, query modification and 
knowledge base have also been used in IR 
system to enhance performance.  
• Information Extraction:  This captures and 
outputs factual information contained within a 
document. Similar to IR system, it responds to 
user’s information need. The information need is not expressed as a keyword query instead it is 
specified as pre- defined database schemas or 
templates.  
 
II. Significance Of Study 
 
i. No Artificial Language 
One advantage of NLIDBs is supposed to be 
that the user is not required to learn an artificia l 
communication language. Formal query 
languages like SQL are difficult to learn and 
master, at least by non-computer-specialists. 
ii. Simple, easy to use 
Consider a database with a query language or a 
certain form designed to display the query. 
While an NLIDB system only requires a single 
input, a form-based may contain multiple inputs 
(fields, scroll boxes, combo boxes, radio 
buttons, etc) depending on the capability of the 
form. In the case of a query language, a question 
may need to be expressed using multiple 
statements which contain one or more sub- 
queries with some joint operations as the 
connector. 
iii. Better for Some Questions 
It has been argued that there are some kind of 
questions (e.g. questions involving negation, or 
quantification) that can be easily expressed in 
natural language, but that seem difficult (or at 
least tedious) to express using graphical or 
form-based interfaces. For example, “Which 
department has no programmers?” (Negation), 
or “Which company supplies every 
department?” (Universal quantification), can be 
easily expressed in natural language, but they 
would be difficult to express in most graphical 
or form-based interfaces. Questions like the 
above can, of course, be expressed in database 
query languages like SQL, but complex 
database query language expressions may have 
to be written.  
 
iv. Fault tolerance 
Most of NLIDB systems provide some 
tolerances to minor grammatical errors, while in 
a computer system; most of the time, the lexicon 
should be exactly the same as defined, the 
syntax should correctly follow certain rules, and 
any errors will cause the input automatically be 
rejected by the system. In the case of incomplete  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 115  
 sentences, most of computer systems do not 
provide any support 
 
v. Easy to Use for Multiple Database Tables 
Queries that involve multiple database tables 
like “list the address of the farmers who got 
bonus greater than 10000 rupees for the crop of 
wheat”, are difficult to form in graphical user 
interface as compared to natural language 
interface.  
 
III. Literature Survey 
The proposed work has been inspired by a 
number of works available in the literature 
related to intelligent aspects of database 
systems. The field of intelligent database and 
information systems has achieved remarkable 
growth in the last few decades. 
 
Statistical Analysis Origins  
Database exploration has origins in statistical 
data analysis and is almost synonymous with 
data exploration; the key difference is that the 
data resides in a database, and is managed by a 
database management system (DBMS). Data 
exploration is an alternate term for exploratory 
data analysis (EDA), a phrase coined by Tukey, 
who offered the following definition: 
“Exploratory data analysis is detective work - 
numerical detective work or counting detective 
work - or graphical detective work ... unless 
exploratory data analysis uncovers indications, 
usually quantitative ones, there is likely to be 
nothing for confirmatory data analysis to 
consider, it can never be the whole story, but 
nothing else can serve as the foundation stone - 
as the first step (Tukey 1977, p1-3).”  
Tukey’s definition contains two important 
elements. The first is that EDA takes on many 
forms (numerical, graphical, etc.). The second is 
that EDA is often the first stage of a data 
analysis, serving to highlight promising areas 
within a database for in-depth investigation. 
Velleman (2009) characterizes EDA as the 
process of seeking patterns, relationships and 
anomalies from data, with an emphasis on data 
manipulations. The data exploration model of 
Jambu (2001) outlines distinct stages of the 
EDA process, from simple analyses of each 
distinct data variable, to dependency and relationship analyses among variables, to 
advanced factor analyses using geometric data 
encodings. Confirmatory data analysis (CDA) is 
subsequently used to verify data distribution 
assumptions, fit models to summarize data 
structures and quantify random error (Nicholson 
2007). Velleman’s characterization concludes 
that the primary software challenge is to 
integrate EDA techniques, graphics and 
calculations with CDA methods. 
 
Search Engines 
History of search engine can be stretched back 
to A.D 1990. The very first tool used for 
searching on the internet was Archie. It was 
created in 1990 by Alan Emtage, a student at 
McGillUniversity in Montreal.   The Archie 
Database was made up of the file directories 
from hundreds of systems. When you searched 
this Archie Database on the basis of a file‘s 
name, Archie could tell you which directory 
paths on which systems hold a copy of the file 
you want. Archie did not index the contents of 
these sites. This Archie Software, periodically 
reached out to all known openly available ftp 
sites, list their files, and build a searchable 
index. The commands to search Archie were 
UNIX commands, and it took some knowledge 
of UNIX to use it to its full capability. [1] 
Later in A.D 1991, Gopher came into the scene. 
Gopher was a menu system that simplified 
locating and using Internet resources.  Gopher  
was  designed  for  distributing,  searching,  and  
retrieving  documents  over  the Internet. 
Gopher offered some features not natively 
supported by the Web and imposes a much 
stronger hierarchy on information stored on it.  
Gopher Software made it possible for the 
system administrator at any Internet site to 
prepare a customized menu of files, features and 
Internet resources.  When you used the Gopher, 
all you had to do is select the item you want 
from the menu. Gopher was a protocol system, 
which in advance of the World Wide Web, 
allowed server based text files to be 
hierarchically organized and easily viewed by 
end users who accessed the server using Gopher 
Applications on remote computers. Initially 
Gopher Browsers could only display text-based 
files before developments such as Hyper  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 116  
 Gopher, which were able to handle simple 
graphic formats. Gopher (1991).  
Archie, Gopher, Veronica and Jug head were 
three  standard ―findingǁ  tools on  the Internet.  
The rise of Gopher led to two new search 
programs, Veronica and Jughead. Like Archie, 
they searched the file names and titles stored in 
Gopher index systems.  Veronica was a 
Resource-Discovery system providing access to 
information resources held on most (99% +) of 
the world‘s Gopher Servers.The Veronica 
Database was a collection of menus from most 
Gopher sites. When you did a Veronica Search, 
you were searching the menu items. Veronica 
used to build an on-the-spot menu consisting of 
just those items that matched your request. 
When the search was finished, Veronica would 
present you with a customized Gopher menu. 
Veronica would not only present you with a list 
of Gopher menu items, it would also act like a 
Gopher.Jughead on the other hand was distinct 
from Veronica. Jughead searched a single server 
at a time. Jughead indexed the servers quickly 
so it used to builds its database in memory.  
When Jughead used all of the available memory, 
it used to become unacceptably slow, limiting 
the size the servers it can index. Veronica does 
not have this problem. [3] 
In 1993, Matthew Gray, then at MIT, produced 
what was probably the first web robot, the Perl-
based World Wide Web Wanderer, and used it 
to generate an index called Wandex.  The World 
Wide Web Wanderer, also referred to as just the 
Wanderer, was a Perl-based web crawler that 
was first deployed in June 1993 to measure the 
size of the World Wide Web.Wanderer was 
developed at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology by Matthew Gray, who now works 
for Google. It was used to generate an index 
called the Wandex later in 1993. While the 
Wanderer was probably the first web robot, and, 
with its index, clearly had the potential to 
become a general-purpose WWW search 
engine. [4] 
A Fuzzy Frame Based System 
Sharma, Kumar, Mustafa and Kumar [5] 
proposed a novel approach, based on fuzzy logic 
and frames, for the creation of fuzzy expert 
shell. The fuzzy logic effectively deals with the 
type of communication normally used by humans, whereas the frames have been used to 
store the correlated information in the form of a 
block. This shell uses a local inference 
mechanism within the frame with the help of a 
multi criteria decision matrix. The User 
interface (UI) allows the user to communicate 
with the system. The user submits the query and 
additional information and when required by the 
system, through UI. It supplies this information 
to Query frame Construction Block for further 
processing. At the end, UI also supplies the final 
output to the user. The major advantage of this 
shell is that it can extract relevant information 
from the user, manage uncertain information 
and produce a credible advice to the user in an 
uncertain environment.  
 
A Web Based System  
Jain B., Jain A. and Srinivas presented the 
design and development of a web based system 
for Fault Diagnosis and Control of Power 
System Equipment and its role in developing an 
Intelligent Fault Diagnosis and Control 
Paradigm (IFDCP) package for power system 
equipment. A brief description of expert system 
architecture and issues involved in developing a 
web based expert system shell and the 
technology used are discussed. The concept of 
designing a web based expert system with a user 
friendly GUI is also discussed. The application 
of the shell to develop the package IFDCP for 
fault diagnosis and control of general power 
system equipment which provides online help 
for diagnosing faults of electrical power 
equipment and clearing them is also tackled. [7] 
 
IV. Methodology 
This project work was achieved by using object 
oriented analysis and design methodology 
(OOADM) and artificial intelligence 
methodology (AI). While OOADM will be used 
to do the following:  
• Analyze problem requirements 
• Design a solution to the problem 
• Implement a solution in a programming 
language or database  
 AI will be used in mapping the natural 
language queries to their corresponding SQL 
statements.  
  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 117  
 • Design Features  
The ID1 supports several features which 
simplify its use in an AI system. These include 
connections to a DBMS are managed 
transparently so that there can be multiple active 
queries to the same database using a single open 
connection. 
Connections to a given database are opened 
upon demand, i.e. at first use instead of 
requiring an explicit database open request. 
Database schema information is loaded from the 
database either when the database is opened or 
when queries require schema information based 
upon user declarations. 
The query interface is a logic-based language 
but uses user supplied functions to declare and 
recognize logic variables. Results of queries to a 
DBMS are cached, improving the overall 
performance system and the cache is accessed 
transparently by a query manager. All but the 
last of the features are described in this section.  
The cache system and initial performance 
results are described in subsequent sections. 
• Intelligent system overview  
To translate a natural language query into SQL 
Query expression, we first need to identify 
words/phrases in user question which will be 
mapped into the corresponding SQL query. 
Unclassified terms can not be mapped in our 
system. We will use query interpretation to fill 
both semantic dictionary from user question and 
lexical dictionary from database metadata. We 
will define query tables and attributes by using 
semantic and lexical dictionaries. Then, we will 
use query generator to map data from semantic 
dictionary with data from lexical dictionary then 
test if we have required data to build SQL query 
component (Tables, Attributes, Conditions) then 
execute query on database and retrieve data to 
user.  
• Intelligent System Components  
The system will consists of four main 
components: User Friendly Interface (UFI) to 
provide user with friendly graphical user 
interface, Query Interpretation (QI) used to fill 
semantic dictionary from user question and fill 
lexical dictionary from database using Metadata, 
Query Generator (QG) used to map semantic 
with lexical dictionary and generate SQL statement and system outputs (RV) used to view 
returned result from database. 
 
Fig 1.1:  Components of the Intelligent 
Interface  
 
In fig 1.1 above, the interface will accept a 
question from the user in the natural language 
(English) form and sends it to the user query 
decomposer. Hence, the query decomposer with 
the SQL server retrieves the appropriate query 
that matches the user question from the 
knowledge base and then through the query 
generator the correct result is displayed via the 
result viewer. 
 
User Friendly Interface  
We will provide user graphical friendly 
interface to facilitate user query by writing 
question in natural language with some user 
guides to ensure that we have enough data to 
generate database query. 
 
Query Interpretation  
After receiving user question there is the ability 
to check if user poses this question before to get 
SQL query that are saved in the system to 
increase performance by providing a method to 
save question. If user poses new question it will 
go further to generate corresponding SQL query 
by using this approach. 
Intelligent system design  
There will be some system artifacts to describe 
our system approach in different forms such as: 
 
Conceptual data model  
This is the highest level ER model in that it 
contains the least granular detail but establishes 
the overall scope of what is to be included 
within the model set. The conceptual ER model 
normally defines master reference data entities  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 118  
 that are commonly used by the organization. 
Developing an enterprise-wide conceptual ER 
model is useful to support documenting the data 
architecture for an organization.  
The conceptual model will be used to describe 
this approach for building SQL query. First, 
user poses a question, it will save user question 
and corresponding query to return query, if user 
ask for this question again to increase system 
performance by calling corresponding query, 
extract words from user question and check for 
synonym words then fill semantic dictionary, 
check if question have condition and define 
which template should be used then fill lexical 
dictionary from database and define word types 
in lexical dictionary.  
 
Physical model  
     The system physical model will be used to 
describe database tables, attributes and 
relationships. User question will have many to 
many relationship with synonym words, each 
word in semantic dictionary have many words 
in synonym word one too many relationship, 
each word in lexical dictionary have one 
corresponding word in semantic dictionary. One 
to one relationship and user question could have 
one or many condition and one too many 
relationships. 
 
V. Expected Result 
     The result of this work is expected to cover 
different areas of linguistic and semantic 
parsing. Authors of existing NLIDB systems 
proposed different algorithms to handle a certain 
level of complexity, but this system will not 
cover complex natural language queries with 
complex semantics.  
     An Intelligent NLIDB that converts the 
queries from the Natural Language form to its equivalent Structured Query Language form 
will be developed. It will start with the syntactic  
analysis. Then, the keyword extractor will use 
the information that has been mapped and 
extract the keywords that are used by the named 
entity recognition tool. The named entity 
recognizer defines the related domain concepts 
like person or department. The identified 
keywords are handled by a SQL Generator 
class. The system will be tested and an input 
data that consists of hand crafted questions 
specifically designed will be used to verify that 
the Intelligent Agent, IA can transform all the 
covered construction rules (that have been 
defined) into correct SQL statement. 
 
VI. Conclusion 
     In this proposed work, a new approach will 
be introduced for generating SQL query using 
multidimensional database interface for non 
expert users by posing a question then 
converting question to SQL query. The main 
advantage of the system is using natural 
language for writing questions, ability to save 
questions and mapped query for each question 
in database to increase system performance and 
stability. We used dynamic template to generate 
database query using query interpretation, 
semantic and lexical analysis to fill semantic 
and lexical dictionaries. Then get required data 
to build SQL query depending on our templates. 
We have used a dynamic approach to generate 
query whatever database we used by using 
metadata to fill lexical dictionary and have 
ability to communicate with different database 
providers by depending on standard SQL query 
language. And this approach will minimize the 
time and effort that used to build the queries.

Abstracte 
In this paper we propose a system that  creates a platform that bridges the communication gap between 
academic staff of higher institutions and parents/g uardians of the undergraduates, with a view to 
improving students participation and interest in th eir academic work. This work was motivated by the r ate 
at which undergraduates lose interest in academics,  depend on cheating during exam, drop out of school  
in pursuit of different restive activities without the knowledge of parents, as well as the alarming r ate at 
which higher institutions produce unskilled, unemplo yable graduates. The Structured System Analysis and  
Design Methodology is applied and a web based syste m, where departments can upload approved results 
and parents can view their children’s result to asce rtain performance is developed .  
 
Keywords: Performance, Enrollment, Monitoring, Result Management,   
 
1. Introduction
Academic success can be defined as the ability of 
an undergraduate to successfully fulfill all 
obligations and requirements for the award of the 
degree for which he/she was granted admission. 
The expectation of every parent when their ward 
is offered admission into any university 
department is that the ward will soon be a 
graduate of that field of study, hence the fun fare , 
celebrations, cakes, food, drinks, picture taking, 
and associated merriment seen on matriculation 
days of higher institutions. Parents, no matter 
how poor, pay for all fees that will secure the 
admission granted their ward. This they may do 
selling off some cherished personal belongings 
such as lands, jewelry etc, to ensure that hope is 
kept alive through their ward’s education. These 
parents live on the believe that someday, after the  
child has completed the degree and secured a 
good job, he/she will help build up the family, 
train younger ones, replace any property invested 
in his/her education, and take care of the parents 
who may be retired.  
The problem therefore is: 
1. Many undergraduates get excited with the 
prospect of leaving home and parents’ control for 
the first time, and being free to go wherever, do 
whatever, demand more with seemingly genuine 
reasons and receive it, that the get lost in the wi de 
high way that leads away from  the golden crown.  2. Parents are either too busy seeking 
financial gains, or they are not educated enough 
to realize that their wards have fallen out and no 
longer coping with studies. 
3. Deep hunger for education has led to 
overcrowding facility and infrastructure 
available, such that, where there should be1 to 10 
lecturer to students quotient, we now have 1 to 
40. Available infrastructure is not maintained, 
hence once it is provided, no one cares if or not 
they are out of use. 
4. Students in departments where student 
intake is high do not bother coming for classes, as  
the lecturers can never complete attendance 
taking before the end of class. 
5. Students’ result is made known only to 
the student, who in turn shows whatever he 
pleases to parents, hence they may even drop out 
without notice. 
 
The result of al stated problems above are: 
1. Increase in crime rate as drop outs who 
are disowned by their parents get into various 
crimes. 
2. Heart break, hopelessness, increased 
poverty, heart attack, and even death.

 2.0 Literature Review 
Parental Support and Academic Achievement  
Fan (2001) demonstrated that parents' educational 
aspiration for their children proved to be strongly  
related to students' academic growth. Research 
studies have found that parental educational level 
has a significant impact on child’s learning(Khan 
&Malik, 1999).  
Similarly, Schneider and Lee (1990) linked the 
academic success of the East Asian students to 
the values and aspirations they share with their 
parents, and also to the home learning activities i n 
which their parents involve with them. In fact, all  
parents have desired to do something better for 
their children according to their available 
resources. But the extent and effectiveness of 
parental support depends on a variety of reasons, 
such as, ethnicity, family income, and home 
environment and their awareness about the 
importance of education. Research studies 
indicated that socio economic status is correlated 
strongly with parents' educational ambition for 
their children. Khan, Khan and Zubairi (1999) 
stated that “interacting with and sharing the 
child’s ac 
The Hewlett Foundation’s Global Development 
Program strategy includes the Quality Education 
in Developing Countries (QEDC) Initiative as one 
of its components. That strategy identifies the 
conditions, drivers, and areas of emphasis for the 
QEDC initiative financed by both the Hewlett and 
the Gates Foundations. This paper describes a 
more detailed grantmaking strategy in three areas 
of investment: more attention to and 
accountability for learning, proven instructional 
models, and sufficient resources used effectively. 
By 2010, the QEDC initiative aims to have a 
portfolio of funded activities that, together, will  
improve student learning and drive education 
reform efforts in East and West Africa and India. 
Students in project areas will be learning more; 
governments, civil society, and donors will be 
able to measure whether students are learning and 
will pay more attention to learning outcomes; and 
policymakers will use information about what 
improves learning outcomes to decide how funds 
for education are allocated. In what follows, we 
first describe the importance of this work. Next 
we specify the goals for our grantmaking. We 
then define the factors necessary for achieving our  goals and identify the particular strategies that w e 
pursue. To do so, we outline the barriers our 
grantmaking strategies are intended to address. 
Finally, we describe our underlying theory of 
change as to how the quality of education in 
developing countries can be improved. 
Asikhia, (2010) in Contemporary Business Education 
  emphasized  on  the differential scholastic 
achievement of students in Nigeria has been and is 
still a source of concern and research interest to 
educators, government and parents. This is so 
because of the great importance that education has 
on the national development of the country. All 
over the country, there is a consensus of opinion 
about the fallen standard of education in Nigeria. 
Parents and government are in total agreement that 
their huge investment on education is not yielding 
the desired dividend. Teachers also complain of 
students’ low performance at both internal and 
external examination. The annual releases of Senior  
Secondary Certificate Examination results (SSCE) 
conducted by West African Examination Council 
(WAEC) justified the problematic nature and  
generalization of poor secondary school students’ 
performance in different school subjects.  
Ijaiya, (2002) in his  book opined  that managing 
any institution of learning involves planning, 
organising, coordinating, motivating, monitoring, 
evaluating, etc. The teaching and learning 
activities to ensure the attainment of educational 
goals and objectives. In other words, teaching and 
learning are the central focus of school 
management. It is however through examination 
that pupils' learning is ascertained. This is why 
teaching is fundamentally considered incomplete 
without some form of evaluation. Examinations 
are therefore part and parcel of school 
management functions. Amoor,  (2008)  stated  
that  secretarial Education is a vocational 
programme that is offered in Secondary schools, 
Polytechnics, Colleges of Education and 
Universities primarily to educate and train 
students to become secretarial teachers and 
administrators with the appropriate skills and 
competencies to take up a career in teaching, 
office occupation and business.  
Afe, (2001) opined  that the issue of academic 
performance of students in Nigeria has been of 
much concern   to all and sundry. Teachers have 
shown an important influence on students’  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 122  
 academic achievement and they also play a 
crucial role in educational attainment because the 
teacher is ultimately responsible for translating 
policy into action and principles based on practice  
during interaction with the students. Consequent 
upon the observed deterioration in the academic 
achievement, attitude and values of secondary 
school students in public secondary schools, one 
wonders if the high failure rates of the students i s 
not a reflection of the instructional quality in th e 
schools. 
 There are several factors affecting student 
academic performance. These are socio-economic 
status, motivation, intellectual ability, stress, a nd 
social factors. The relationship between socio-
economic status and academic performance is a 
saturated research area. Studies have proven that 
socio-economic status is highly correlated with 
academic performance, at all levels and in all 
courses. Some research however suggests that 
socio-economic status is a determinant of college 
attendance rather than academic performance. In a 
more common sense assessment, self-supporting 
students are likely to miss classes due to work and  
the pressure of putting food on the table and the 
payment of tuition fees. 
The fact remains however that classroom 
attendance is necessary for a better understanding 
of their knowledge and its application. In some 
schools class attendance is compulsory and has a 
bearing on the grades of the students. Given the 
above-mentioned assumptions, the self-supporting 
student therefore gets lower grades than his 
classmates who belong to the higher socio-
economic status. 
In the context of academic achievement of science 
and technology students is affected by socio-
economic status, motivation, intellectual ability, 
stress and social factors. In addition to the 
abovementioned factors an interesting area in the 
research of science and technology students 
academic achievement may focus on emotional 
quotient and its effect on academic achievement. 
Another realm of research in science and 
technology students academic achievement is to 
look into emotional intelligence and its effect on 
the academic achievement of students in school. 
Correlates of academic achievement of individual 
students in many disciplines have been identified 
through school factor and students attitude towards academic performance in various 
disciplines. Determinants of students' 
performance have been the subject of ongoing 
debate among educators, academics, and policy 
makers. In the course of writing this study, the 
researcher intends to investigate Students poor 
performance in typewriting examination 
in tertiary institution. 
Aremu (2003) stated that poor academic 
performance is adjudged by the examinee/testee 
and some other significant as falling below an 
expected standard.  
 Poor academic performance or high failure rates 
may result in lack of gratification and job 
satisfaction, which in turn leads to low 
productivity reduced ROI(Return On Investment). 
Some of the identified variables that influences 
students academic performance are 
demographic, socio-economic, family and school 
factors, with varying degree of influence. Family 
involvement however, may play intercessory role 
that help reconcile ward and lecturer, and restore 
celf esteem before much damage is done.

1. Card Reader 
 
Fig 3.1: Card Reader 
     In this paper, we propose the use of card read er, 
that will validate a student’s id card for 
attendance to class in the first 30 minutes of clas s 
and forward same to a database from which class 
attendance can be printed and scored. 
The card reader is also proposed to be used to 
match students’ finger prints before allowing 
them sit for exam. 
 
Questionnaire 
A questionnaire generated captured both parents 
and students alike.For parents, we seek to know 
how many of their wards have graduated from 
higher institution, how many of them are  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 123  
 following a career in field of study, challenges 
they have as well as their general experience with 
both undergraduate and graduate wards. 
For the students, we seek to understand the reason 
for the drift. From being an excited fresher, to 
being tired of school, not regular, and not 
punctual to classes.

each course? 3. Was your performance last semester 
good? 
4. Do your parents know your last semester 
result in school? 
5. Will you give your consent to your 
semester result to be accessed by your parents? 
6. Students parents and lecturers open 
communication channel will enhance feedback 
and  reinforcement. 
 
3.3 Sample of Graduates Questionnaire 
1. Are you happy that you are a graduate?  
2. Are you happy with your performance?  
3. Were your parents excited with your 
performance as a graduate?  
4. Did you graduate as at  when due?  
5. As a student then, was your performance 
affected by sexually harassment and cultism?  
6. Did your parents know your challenges 
and performance in school?  
7. As a graduate will you advice the 
undergraduates to take their studies serious and 
attend lectures   
always.  
3.4 Sample of Lecturers’ Questionnaire 
1. Do you know your students? 
2. Is attendance compulsory  in your class? 
3. Do you take students evaluation serious? 
4. Results are released as at when due? 
5. Do you advice for an amendment on the 
system results are being published? 
6. Lecturers are key partners in the teaching 
and learning process. 
7. Should parents have access to their 
children’s result/performance? 
 
Experiment  
 The software accepts user name and password 
from parents and validates their access to the 
result system.Parents can view, print their wards’ 
result with a view to helping them improve.  
 
 
Conclusion 
     Academic success has a great influence on a 
student’s self-esteem, motivation, and perseverance  
in higher education. Poor academic performance or 
high failure rates may result in unacceptable level s 
of attrition, reduced graduate throughput and 
increased cost of education. This also reduces admission opportunities for tertiary students 
seeking higher degrees. Hence, students’ academic  
 
 
 
performance has always been a topic of interest for  
educators. Educators and researchers have 
longbeen interested in identifying and  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 124  
 understanding the variables that contribute to 
academic excellence. Many researchers have 
identified demographic, socio-economic, family 
and school factors as variables contributing to 
students’ academic performance. Every academic 
institute has certain criteria for students regardi ng 
their performance in class. That is why keeping 
the accurate record of result is very important. At  
present, results are usually noted using paper sheets and the old file system, this approach has 
been in use for a long time. It becomes difficult 
for the management to regularly update the record 
and manually send them to parents. Keeping these 
issues in mind,the system  designedwill overcome 
the problems associated with students academic 
performance, propose 70% attendance of class in 
a session before  being allowed to continue a new 
academic level.

Abstract 
The “Expert System for Hepatitis diagnosis” softwar e is designed to include domain expert knowledge 
and control in one integrated package of medical an d electronic technology with its special applicatio n in 
hepatitis diagnosis. Thus, this software will be spec ifically used for hepatitis diagnosis and treatment.  This 
piece of work was motivated by the nagging problems , which include incessant death that occurs as a 
result of absence and inadequate number of medical experts, unavailability or infeasibility of high 
technologies and late detection of hepatitis. So th e primary objective of this article therefore, is t o design 
and develop an expert system that will enable the n on professionals (junior medical expert) to perform  the 
functions of human experts (domain personnel’s) in the absence of all. The Structured System Analysis 
and Design Method (SSADM) was employed as a researc h methodology. The expected results shall 
include; to generate numerous reports such as criti cal cases analysis in form of knowledge based syste m 
(KBS), phases of different hepatitis cases and treat ment as an expertise etc. 
Keywords: Software, Expert system, Hepatitis, Diagnosis

Introduction
According toAkerkar R.C Medical profession is 
defined as a body of individuals who are qualified 
to practice medicine. Medical and health 
profession makes up part of a flowing industry 
today with many career opportunities. As a result 
of the numerous sub disciplines under this 
profession and how important the profession has 
been to human life, it has been an everyday 
objective to fetch best method to apply in order to  
increase their operation effectively. Again, 
considering the fact that computer is applicable to  
almost every aspect of their operation, the idea of  
designing an expert system for hepatitis diagnosis 
calls for effective and efficient operation in orde r 
to always have an optimum result. The “Hepatitis 
Expert System” is software designed to perform 
the work of human doctor in the absence of all. 
The system does this by providing the required or 
adequate guide from its knowledge base which 
none professionals will follow to perform the 
diagnosis effectively and efficiently. 
It has been stated above, that this expert system i s 
designed to function in the intensive care 
department of the medical field in the absence of 
human medical expert during the diagnosis. It makes use of solutions from the previous cases 
(case based reasoning) in its knowledge base in 
controlling the system. It also combines various 
disciplines such as mechanical, electrical, 
electronics, computer, biological, and many others 
which are to be used in representing the next 
generation machine or robots. Thus, an expert 
system is a branch of cognitive science that uses a  
set of programs to manipulate encoded knowledge 
in solving problems that exists in specialized 
business domain which normally requires human 
expertise. It uses encoded knowledge obtained 
from human experts and represents it in a form 
that is suitable for the system to recognize and us e 
it in its inference or reasoning processes. 
1.1. Conceptual Framework  An expert 
system is the aspect of cognitive science in 
software form whose function is to hold 
knowledge extracted from an expert and keep 
them for use. The word expert system simply 
means the software that does the work of an 
expert just like human expert will do and brings 
an expertise decision as an output. Expert system 
is software that has an embedded knowledge of an 
expert which a non-expert can use to perform the  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 126  
 work of a professional in a given field. It is made  
to advise a non-expert to work like a professional 
in that field. During expert system 
development,knowledge must be acquired, 
represented, manipulated and use.  
Medical expert system is a multidisciplinary field 
of science that includes a combination of 
mechanical, electrical,electronics,computer, 
telecommunication, system engineering, control 
engineering and many others. 
Engineersanstrailia.org stated that medical 
diagnosis expert system differs from automation 
engineering in that its practitioners have a deep 
understanding (idea) of the system performance 
analysis and the design of the complex machine. 
An expert system used in medical field is a 
biomedical engineering approach, which describes 
novel solutions for utilizing the extracted 
knowledge (EEK) in problem solving. Such 
problems may be design innovative, accurate and 
intelligent medical devices, and optimize 
conventional medical instruments. This part of 
artificial intelligent makes use of medical 
imagining in building an expert system. Thus this 
expert system for medical diagnosis is defined by 
me as software that feeds the non-expert with 
required instruction to carry out a diagnosis. The 
non expert can be the nurses, laboratory personnel 
etc who can carry out the assignment of a human 
doctor. Do to the problem of unavailability of 
medical experts today; there is a great need for 
developing this system. It is being recognized as 
an interconnected nature of knowledge from 
different disciplines, an approach known as 
holistic knowledge. 
This work titled Hepatitis expert system is 
software that is designed to integrate numerous 
expertise which can be used any time for problem 
solving such as risk analysis problems. During 
this process, all the required relevant fields from  
the patient are collected for building patient 
record. Such record includes the following fields: 
patient ID, name, date of birth, gender, blood 
group, allergies, medical history, current doctor, 
symptoms, treatment, X-ray or body scan and 
diagnoses. All these field of a patient record is 
known as personal data thus personal data is the 
attributes that best introduces the person in question. It uses arranged knowledge for its 
inference purposes. It also uses rule base and 
condition to achieve its purpose through the 
means of system inference engine. Knowledge 
used here can be collected manually or 
electronically. The pattern used while extracting 
knowledge is the manual method. Although some 
technologies like phone, radio or television has 
been a means of information dissemination or 
flow, there are yet the need for developing this 
system since those media cannot fill the gap. 
Finally, this work tends to harness, collect, 
arrange, and represent numerous number of expert 
knowledge into that single system known as 
hepatitis diagnosis expert system and provide the 
easiest methods or phases of utilizing them 
through its graphical user interface for better 
operation. 
 
1.2 Statement of the problem 
The Nigeria hospitals are currently running on 
human doctor method of diagnosis practices, 
when this expert is unavailable or inadequate 
number of them needed, this leads to human 
death.  
Sometimes the job seems to be tedious and 
stressful for this domain experts since in most 
cases, the attention of the doctors are needed most  
lately in the night. This pattern is expensive henc e 
the cost of hiring human experts cannot be 
compared with the cost of developing this system. 
Information available in the old method is limited 
in such that if only one doctor is present, the 
knowledge to be utilized is just a single medical 
expert brain. 
 
1.3 Objectives of the study 
This is to design and develop an expert system for 
hepatitis diagnosis.  The key objectives include: 
I. Developing a system that provides the total, 
accurate, and integral knowledge from human 
expert required for diagnosis thus making 
information available for the young growing 
doctors for research purposes 
Creating a system or software that introduces the 
use of electronic filing pattern as to quicken 
searching methods like traversing, sorting etc 
using unique identification key and providing the  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 127  
 user friendly interface for querying the system 
knowledge base. 
The software developed will also be able to 
display the respective treatment phases with its 
analysis and alternative conditions. 
1.4. Methodology 
     The Structured System Analysis and Design 
Methodology (SSADM) was used. According to 
Obichere, the justification for choosing SSADM 
over other engineering methods as approved by 
IEEE was its waterfall techniques through which 
systems designs are easily achieved. Data flow 
model (DFM), which is the process of identifying 
and documenting how data moves around in the 
system, data storages, external entities and data 
flows in the entire system of SSADM were 
applied. After considering SSADM disadvantages 
which includes modularization and automated 
code generation, the researcher has finally chose 
to use the structured system analysis and design 
methodology since it reduces development time, 
increases reliability of components, quick initial 
review occurs and the integration start from the 
very beginning of this work. 
The materials used on the study included those 
gotten from field studies, primary and secondary 
sources of data and information and the World 
Wide Web, inter alia. Such materials included oral 
interviews, procedure manual, Observation, 
Mondus operandi and internet search engines 
materials among others. All these were integrated 
in an interwoven characteristic in order to make 
sense using the afore-mentioned research 
methodology to produce this work. 
 
1.6 System analysis and design 
1.6.1. Analysis of the present system 
Investigation on the present system was carried 
out to obtain detailed fact about the application 
area to be designed. This was done by taking a 
look at the functional requirements of the present 
system and finding out whether the requirements 
of it are being achieved. Identifying the 
constraints of the present system, the exceptional 
conditions and noting its problems. To obtain 
these facts about the present system, several 
research method were used. (a) The interviewing of personnel: this method is the 
face to face discussion with the medical experts 
and lab scientist. Here the medical experts were 
fully interviewed and much information on the 
ways to decipher the ailment was gathered. 
(b) Observation: In the situation where answers to 
questions were not descriptive enough, it became 
necessary to observe the way things were being 
done, the sequence of phases and activities 
involved for a perfect diagnosis. Some findings 
were also observed and such data were collected 
such as various methods of file processing and 
retrieval, diagnosis patterns, and stages involved. 
1.7. Perceived problems with the present 
system 
1. The old system gives room to loss of lives: in a 
situation where the medical practitioners (experts)  
are not in the hospital for some reasons like late 
hour labour strike and others this incident can tak e 
human life. 
2. Keeping patient record for difficult cases 
(complicated and non-complicated) that come 
daily is ambiguous. The record books are always 
voluminous 
3. Loss of important information: files can be 
destroyed by fire accident, eaten by some insects, 
rodents this in turn causes a lot of damages to 
important documents. 
4. No data integrity, consistency and accuracy. 
Considering the way they operate, no one can 
guarantee even 90 percent accuracy of 
information provided because; some files can no 
longer be traced again. Some are being taken off 
or misplace during renovation or relocation if they  
are considered invalid as at that time which may 
be needed in future. 
5. Record/case redundancy: As a result in this of 
improper use of primary key in this manual 
method, files sometimes repeat itself which causes 
confusion while retrieving files. 
6. Time Lapse: this method consumes time, the 
system is always slow in responding as queuing 
system said it “the arrival time, waiting time (tim e 
spend in queue), service time, departure time” 
does not tally hence waiting time and service time 
is always longer. 
7. Energy sapping stress involve when travelling for 
file submission and other relevant documents.

 8. Insecurity: patient data is not properly guided 
because no authorized password is used therefore one cannot assure of its securit

2. Software design 
This is a delicate procedures and a stage 
involving detailing of how the system is to be 
built. It has to be detailed enough for the system 
to be fully implemented. During the design phase, 
the inputs are precisely defined as well as the 
required output. The database is developed using 
My Structural Query Language (My SQL) as the 
back end, Through the use of some tools like 
organogram, flowchart, and dataflow diagram. 
The systems design in this work is the process that 
defines the architecture, components, interfaces, 
modules and data for a system to satisfy specified 
requirements.   
 
2.1 Objectives of the design  
The main objectives of the new system Hepatitis 
Diagnosis Application (HDA), is as follows 
i. Provide a simple user friendly interface for its 
users. iii. ii. Integrate an awareness feature which will 
enable users to know how dangerous alcohol or 
hepatitis can be.  
iii. Integrate a feature which will be used to 
make sure that users are able to diagnose the type 
of hepatitis they have. 
iv. Ensure that reliable storage and database 
design is provided for collecting user statistics a t 
start up. 
 
2.1.2. System design In this context, the 
definition of the architecture, components, 
modules, interfaces and data for the new system 
will be made.

3. Summary  
 The study dealt with a proposal for a 
development of software that has an embedded 
knowledge of experts which a non-expert can use to 
perform the work of a professional in a given field . 
This work can be adopted by medical practitioners. 
As has been discussed, the importance of 
automating the diagnostic center of the medical 
system has been broadly specified. With these 
analyses, it is very essential that much more 
attention should be channeled to this center to be 
sure that human lives are saved promptly and boost 
communication among this same unit of various 
hospitals all over the nation in case of emergency.  
This will also build the bridge or put a link betwe en 
doctors and lab technologist and improve their 
performance (integrity and consistency) hence gives  
room for immediate response to critical conditions 
when needed. It will also make files created in 
diagnostic center of every hospital available from 
every node at any point in time. With this, it is v ery 
important that this system is implemented. Finally,  
the efficiency, consistency and integrity of this 
work together with its reliability have been 
guaranteed, as the weak points and bottle neck of 
the old system has been collected and put in place.  
The achievement recorded by this design can be 
summarized as follow: 
• In the absence of human experts, this system 
serves as one; hence it provides all the guidelines  
required to carry out hepatitis diagnoses. The 
system as well integrates the knowledge of thousand and one human experts hence adequacy, 
accuracy and correct result is guaranteed. 
• With this design, records keeping in 
diagnosis center are done electronically; therefore , 
it becomes very easier for the medical personnel 
to access their patient record from every node 
during the diagnosis. 
• Finally, it provides users with an organized 
approach and access to database which support 
some data encryption through the use of database 
management system (DBMS) for redundancy 
elimination 
4. Conclusions 
The design of the expert system for diagnosing 
hepatitis has been done to improve the old system. 
This new system, unlike the existing one has 
features that make it unique, effective and more 
reliable. The features include:  
i) It is user friendly and simple to use.  
ii) There are reduced error occurrences to the 
barest minimum. 
iii) Time taken for the diagnosis will now be 
faster because a secure database has been 
introduced. 
iv) It diagnoses hepatitis and proffers treatment 
recommendations as well. 
v) The high level of operating efficiency, 
which has been incorporated into the new system, 
has helped immensely to enhance quick decision-
making. 
vi) There is improved confidence among 
medical experts

Abstract  
Present washing machine cannot foretell the correct  spinning speed for washing different type of cloth , 
type of dirtiness and type of dirt. This work aimed  to design and implement intelligent washing machin e 
using fuzzy logic inference model that will checks for the extent of dirt, and dirtiness of cloth and then 
select the appropriate spinning speed. The four exp erimental analysis performed for various washing ti me 
for different cloth for the improved system are (19 .3 min, 19.5min, 30min, and 30mins) while the washi ng 
time for the existing system are (30.9min, 35.1min,  42.5 and 51.4)  respectively. The result from the four 
experimental analysis shows that the proposed system r educed washing time for different cloths.

Introduction
Automatic washing machine is a type of machine 
whose load is wholly handled by the device. In 
recent time, washing machine allows users to choose  
the wash interval established on the parameters lik e 
quantity of clothes, the nature of cloths or dirtin ess 
of the cloths. The wash period of the machine is th en 
ascertained by the machine. Regrettably, there is n o 
simple way to create a mathematical connection 
among size of clothes and nature of dirt as well as  
the required span of wash period. Therefore, this 
issue has continued to be unsolved till very lately . As 
a result, users manually set wash times which is 
typically based on individual trial or from their e rror 
experience. Sincerely, washing machineries utilized  
now were not as programmed as they ought to be. 
The use of sensors devices was applied to mechanize  
this device so as to detect the input parameter (i. e. 
type of clothes, dirtiness of the cloth and type of  
dirt). The fuzzy controller has the duty of creatin g 
the decisions in the device and the decision is sig nal 
outside to the user as an output. Since the 
output/input association has not be strong, designi ng 
washing machine regulator has not being a success in  
the previous using classic means of control design 
[1]. In this paper is gear toward using fuzzy logic  
regulator to provide with the exact wash period eve n 
when an accurate model of output/input association 
is not obtainable. The Improved Fuzzy logic washing  
machine will made functions of washing machines more economical, energy-saving and less time-
consuming. 
i. Literature review 
[2] developed Fuzzy Logic control for Washing 
Device. Their fuzzy logic regulator was built using  
dissimilar degree of dirt and type of dirt as input  to 
obtain the system wash time. But they were not able  
to extend control for other parameter like spinning  
speed and water level. 
Fuzzy controller neural network for washing 
Machine was projected by[3]. His model was built 
using fuzzy logic concept, neural network and its 
learning algorithm to reduce wasting of electricity  
and water. The parameters used were water level, 
flow intensity and the system output is wash time. 
A fuzzy logic control system was proposed by [1] to  
optimize washing period for washing device. They 
address the design problem for washing machine by 
using fuzzy logic. Their results showed that with 
Fuzzy logic controller gives accurate wash interval  
for washing device ever without clear output and 
input relationship model. They also could not exten d 
control for parameter like water level and spinning  
speed.  
A Fuzzy logic controller for washing Machine was 
proposed using arduino by [4]They were capable to 
obtain the system wash time and also recommended 
that the design can be protracted without much 
difficulties to other parameters like spinning spee d 
and water level.

 [5] proposed Fuzzy logic system for Washing 
Device. They show the performance Analysis for 
the system utilizing Five Input and Three Output. 
Their objectives were to save a lot of electricity,  
water and time for washing the cloth. Their 
proposed FLC was simulated using MATLAB 
simulation language. The result calculated the 
wash period, rinse time and spin time.  
A neruo-fuzzy controller for washing device using f our 
inputs was proposed by [6].The input factors were: type 
of clothes, degree of dirt, amount of dirt and amou nt of 
water. The output parameter was spin time. Their ai med 
was to minimize energy use in washing process. The 
engine for the system was built using neuro techniq ue to 
help the releases of waterand detergent as when the  need 
arise. Their proposed system did not incorporate co ntrol 
for water level and spinning speed. 
[7] examined a relative study for washing machines 
efficiency applying fuzzy logic control. They 
observed that degree of dirt is the very beneficial  
factor to regulate the washing period and to analys is 
the effectiveness of the device. Numerical example 
and Fuzzy solution of the process can defend the 
cogency of their approach consequently it can likel y 
to ascertain the correctness as stated by some mathematical formulation which can be made 
because of certain vague or logical circumstances 
A Fuzzy logic control for Washing Machine was 
also proposed by  [8] using Three Input (type 
of cloth, type of dirt, dirtiness of the cloth) 
and  One Output (wash time). The outcome 
gotten from fuzzy inference method is then 
treated to yield a finite result. 
This work design and simulate an intelligent 
washing machine using fuzzy logic inference 
model.  The system considered input 
parameter such as:, type of cloth, types of 
dirt, dirtiness of the cloth as well as the 
spinning speed  and the output for  device is 
washing time.  
Design of the system 
The design adopted a pattern of rule that can 
calculate the spinning speed of washing 
device for efficient and minimal wash time 
subject to distinct limits. This will reduce the 
utilization of water for washing of clothes, 
electricity and save lots of time. The system 
will intelligently balance the machine wash 
load to guarantee correct spinning and as well 
decreases spinning speed when it notice a 
disparity.

 dirt, the extent of dirt on clothes, type of clothe s, 
and the spinning speed, Fuzzy intelligent logic 
model and the system output which is wash time. 
The fuzzy set defined for linguistic variables 
applied in the system for “types of cloths” are as 
follow: Not greasy, medium, And Greasy.  The set 
for  “types of dirt” are small, large and medium. 
The set for “dirtiness of cloth” are not greasy, 
medium,   and Greasy.  The set for “spinning speed” are low, medium and high. We also has the 
fuzzy set for the system only output “wash time ” a s 
Very short, short, medium and long 
 
a)  Fuzzy rules base . 
With four inputs each have three membership 
function, we formulate a total of 27 rules as 
presented in table1

b) Defuzzification
The three most common defuzzification methods 
in used are Max-criterion, Center-of-gravity and 
the Mean of maxima (MOM). We applied the 
Mean of maxima (MOM) in this study because it 
is frequently used method and its computational 
complexity is relatively high. MOM is denoted as: 
T0= max 
……………………….1 
Where x is the centroid of area,  a = smallest of max, b = mean of max, c = largest 
of max  
Using equation 1 to solve for fuzzy set vshort as 
 vshort = max 
………………………2 
 vshort = 0.4 
shortµ (5)= 0.5 
mediumµ(25)= 0.5  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 136  
 Finally, we calculate for variable long using the 
min-max formula, 
longµ  (30)= 0.5 
In a discrete form, COG (crisp output) is defined 
by: 
  COG        =

Where N i is the value of quantization used to 
discretize membership function 0Tµ(y) = fuzzy 
output T0.  
0Tµ(y) = the degree of membership. 
yi = elements of the set. 
Equation 2 can likewise be express as thus: 
Crisp Output = {(Sum(Membership 
Degree*Singleton Position)}/(Membership 
degree)..3.8 
 
Supposing that the output degree after rule 
evaluation are:  
 Vshort=0.4,  Short = 0.5, 
 Medium = 0.5,  
 Long = 0.5  
Then using the values for each of this linguistic 
variables  
Vshort= 7, 
          Short = 19,   
Medium= 23, 
 Long =43 
The crisp value for wash duration to be:  
Wash time = (0.4*7) + (0.5*19) + (0.5*23) + 
(0.5*42) + (0.5*51)/(0.4+0.5+0.5+0.5) = 33.12 
minus. 
ii. Results 
This paper developed a pattern and rules that can 
predict the spinning speed of washing machine for 
minimal wash time depending on different 
parameters. To increase the eminence washing 
device, the spinning speed was scales from 0rpm 
to 1600rpm. The results had shown that proposed 
system intelligently rebalance the wash contents 
to make sure that accurate spinning speed and 
decreases spinning speed whenever an inequity is 
noticed.  Fuzzy logic for washing device in figure

a) Discussion of Findings 
The paper has found that The introduction of 
different spinning speed minimized processing 
time for washing device and saves resources. The 
proposed system was simulated four times with 
different values of style of cloths (30 = Silk) 
nature of dirt (30=not greasy), type of dirtiness o f 
cloth (30=small) which gave 19.3mins washing 
time for the planned system and 30.9mins for the 
present system as revealed in table 4.  Figure 4 
shows graphical representation of the comparison 
of the washing duration for both the existing and 
Improved system are presented. 
Userinteractive interface for fuzzy washing 
machine was developed with java programming 
language. It has four input box such as type of cloth, type of dirt, type of dirtiness and spinning  
speed and output box.  
.  Figure 4 shows graphical representation of the 
comparison of the washing duration, 
 
iii. Conclusion 
iv. This paper successfully designed an intelligent 
washing device that effectively checks for the 
kind of dirt, the type of cloth and the dirtiness o f 
cloth, and then used an appropriate spinning speed 
to diminished wash time. The machine controller 
was centered on fuzzy logic. This system is an 
intelligent system that monitors the changing 
situations in the device and consequently 
regulates actions of the system for the best wash 
results.

Abstract  
Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) h as grown and developed over the years, impacting 
so greatly on new or modern businesses. This has re ally become a broad subject area expanding into the  
growth and applications of e-commerce, potential of  e-business, e-market places, e-customer relationsh ip 
management, and the rise of online customer feedbac k, automation of business functions such as 
electronic payments/money transfers, high density d ata transfer and the impact on postal service. The 
adoption of these technologies in many countries by  different sectors of the economy have been found t o 
have direct positive impact on the organization’s e fficiency and have led to more rapid acceleration o f 
development in these countries. In Nigeria, however , preliminary investigations show that only a few 
organizations in the economy have adopted the ICT, but there has not been formal study to determine th e 
level of adoption and impact on the efficiency of t he organizations and the consequent effect on the 
nation's economy. This study, is therefore, designe d to determine the level of adoption in the Nigeria n 
organizations, and the impact on the nation’s econo my. The research adopts quantitative (hypothetic 
deductive) methodology, which design administered a  survey instrument in the form of a questionnaire. 
The results of the quantitative analysis were discu ssed and interpreted in relation to the key issues of the 
research. The outcome of the work recognises the st rategic role of ICT in national development, trade,  
competitiveness and employment. It further apprecia tes that the Information and Communication 
Technology (ICT) sector has come to play a critical  role in the sustainable growth and development of the 
Nigerian economy by revealing that in Nigeria today , the ICT sector is a major pillar of the economy i n 
terms of its contribution to the Gross Domestic Pro duct (GDP). The outcome of this study will be a use ful 
guide to the government of Nigeria, policy makers a nd the general public on how ICT can be used as a 
tool for economic growth and development. This rese arch will also serve as a resource base to other 
scholars and researchers interested in carrying out  further research on how information technology 
affects the socioeconomic development of any nation.

Initiatives 
 
1. Introduction 
Information and Communication Technology 
(ICT) is fundamentally changing the lives of 
much of the world’s population. In its various 
forms, ICT affects many of the processes of 
government and business, how individuals live, 
work and interact, and the quality of the natural 
and built environment. The development of 
internationally comparable ICT statistics is 
essential for governments to be able to adequately 
design, implement, monitor and evaluate ICT 
policies [1]. 
Several definitions exist to show the 
differences or similarities ICT has with 
Information technology (IT). In a paper, 
Achimugu, Oluwagbemi, Oluwaranti and Afolabi 
[2] view IT to several forms of information 
exchange between two or more computers through any of the several methods of 
interconnection. These technologies provide 
speedy, inexpensive and convenient means of 
communication. However, in answering to a blog 
submission, Khy Boogie clarified that Information 
Communication Technology (ICT) is an umbrella 
term used to encompass all rapidly emerging, 
evolving and converging computer, software, 
networking, telecommunications, Internet, 
programming and information systems 
technologies [3]. Therefore, due to the 
overlapping similarities between IT and ICT, this 
research paper adopts the two acronyms as same.  
ICT accessibility and user friendliness have 
promoted the ease of access and lowered cost of 
every kind of information having provided the 
necessary infrastructure for high speed computing  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 140  
 and digitization, thereby, transforming the way 
that information is accessed, manipulated, 
transmitted and stored. This has helped to increase  
the level of its global distribution for decision 
making and strategic position of enterprises 
involved [4]. Hales [5] submits that recent 
changes in economic conditions, organisational 
structures, and enterprise processes are based not 
just on information availability and asymmetry, 
but on the way of its distribution. Furthermore, 
enhanced communication and distribution 
channels opened up by the advent of the Internet 
and other related communication technology has 
net organisations and customers in proximity all 
over the world than ever before, thus, creating 
new business avenues [5]. 
Presently, ICT has evolved into a major pillar 
to economic development and a backbone of 
knowledge-based economies in terms of 
operations, quality delivery of services and 
productivity of services [6]. There is now growing 
evidence that knowledge-driven innovation is a 
decisive factor in the competitiveness of nations, 
industry, organizations and firms. Recent 
initiatives have brought about fundamental 
changes in Nigerian economy such as the 
integrated payroll system which helps in blocking 
leakages, interbank clearing system which 
shortens time for interbank payments. The 
introduction of online auction system by Nigeria 
customs service though not perfect yet but has 
greatly improve the economic activities in terms 
of revenue generation for the government and 
reduction in hardship usually associated with 
manual auctions for auctioneers. The Automated 
clearing system services in ports when fully 
operational will reduce the turnaround time for clearing activities at the ports and also increase in 
revenue generation for the agency.     
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) 
has now been accepted as one of the main driving 
forces behind organizational competitiveness in the  
present-day business environment. Presently, ICT is  
having dramatic influence on almost all areas of 
human and economic activities. 
The aggressive and notable drive by the Federal 
Government of Nigeria embarked upon at the 
wake of 2000 towards the provision of more 
efficient services in the nation through its 
privatization and deregulation policies in the IT 
subsector, as cited in a report by Ndianaefo [7]. I t 
was noted that the policy thrives led to the 
establishment of National Telecommunication 
Policy in December 2001 by the National 
Information Technology Development Agency. 
Later it was mandated by the National 
Information Technology Development Act (2007) 
to create a framework for the planning, research, 
development, standardization, application, 
coordination, monitoring, evaluation and 
regulation of Information Technology practices, 
activities and systems in Nigeria. This report was 
submitted while highlighting the recent approval 
of ICT Roadmap (a fundamental component of 
the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan 2017-
2020 of the Federal Government) by the Federal 
Executive Council. This notification was made by 
the Minister of Communications, Mr. Adebayo 
Shittu, at the 13th International Conference of the  
Nigeria Computer Society in Abuja where the 
Honourable Minister announced the proposal of 
the Federal Government to establish a specialized 
bank to cater to the development of the ICT 
industry, and the soon kick-off of a proposed ICT 
University [7].  
 
1.1. Statement of The Problem 
The pervasiveness and importance of Information 
and Communication Technology (ICT) 
throughout the economy and society cannot be 
ignored. The former and late United Nations 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, stated that, "If 
harnessed properly, ICT has the potential to 
improve all aspects of our social, economic and 
cultural life. ICT can serve as an engine for 
development in the twenty - first century" [8]. The  
question that readily comes to mind, how can the 
ICT policy challenges be addressed at both national and international levels, and in all 
sectors? It is worthy to note that, there are other  
key areas of national development that 
collectively with ICT development policies forms 
the complete web of national ICT growth-oriented 
strategy [9].  
Past studies on the developing economy have 
bothered on the challenges and roles of ICTs on 
economic growth [10]. Thus, this study examines 
the impact of Information and Communication 
Technology on the Nigerian economy. Further, it 
delves into the impact ICT have in the socio- 
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 141  
 economic sector as well as its potency in 
mitigating agents of corruption by ensuring 
accountability and transparency within the 
organisational or government ecosystem which 
have the ripple effect of posing hinderances to the  
economic growth and development of any nation. 
 
1.2. Research Aim and Objectives 
The main thrust of this research is to evaluate the  
impact of ICT on the Nigerian economic growth 
and development.  
Thus, the specific objectives of the study include:  
1.  To identify ways by which ICT can contribute 
to economic growth and development  
2.  To determine the factor limiting the use of ICT 
in all sectors of the Nigerian economy. 
3. To investigate how the availability to easier 
access to ICT could be enabled? 
4. To analyse how the accelerating growth in ICT 
impacts the development of Nigeria Industries on 
the areas of trade and long-term competitiveness 
5. To examine how useful ICT is as a tool to 
combat hindrance to national development 
 
1.3. Research Questions and Hypotheses 
1.3.1. Research Questions 
The following research questions shall be 
answered in this study: 
1.  How can ICT contribute to national economic 
growth and development? 
2.  What are the factors limiting the use of ICT in  
all sectors of the Nigerian economy? 3. How can the availability to easier access to ICT  
be enabled? 
4. How can the accelerating ICT growth impact 
the development of Nigeria Industries on the areas 
of trade and long-term competitiveness? 
5. How useful is ICT as a tool to combat 
hindrances to national development? 
6. Is there any relationship between the size of 
organisation or the nature of business, and the ICT 
impact for economic growth and development? 
7. Is there any significant difference between ICT 
impact on development and ICT strategy for 
Adoption? 
 
1.3.2. Research Hypotheses 
Sequel from the above research questions, the 
following research hypotheses will suffice: 
HO1: There is no relationship between the ICT impac t 
for economic growth and development, and the 
size of organisation. 
HO2: Medium-sized organisations do not significantl y 
deploy ICT for economic impact more than small- 
sized organization. 
HO3: There is no significant relationship between t he 
increase Access to ICT services and ICT 
deployment for government services for national 
economic growth and development.  
HO4: The improvement in Public Service, the creatio n 
some well-felt macroeconomic effects, and ICT 
sector as one of the highest job creators do not 
significantly impact on the positive effect of ICT 
on national growth via increase in GDP growth. 
2. Literature Review 
2.1. An Overview of the Role of IT in the 
Economy 
In some parts of the world today, IT is a major 
contributor to revolutionary changes in business, 
commerce and daily living. Ironically, there are 
yet other parts of the world, especially those 
lacking the capability to design, produce, use and 
maintain IT components, that such impacts have 
been very minimal and, in some cases, non-
existent. Nigeria unfortunately falls into the latt er 
category [11]. It is unfortunate in the sense that 
the enormous social and economic potentials of 
Nigeria, unlike other African countries, put her at  
an advantageous position among the countries in 
the former category, if she had utilized the 
enormous natural resources for meaningful 
development. The country’s inability to do this 
has contributed immensely to her passive participation in the global information society. 
Nigeria today is a heavy consumer of IT 
components without the capability to produce 
any. 
 
2.2. An Overview of ICT Initiatives in Nigeria 
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) 
is an essential ingredient for socio economic 
development of any nation.  It is also central to 
Nigeria’s plans of becoming one of the top 20 
global economies by the year 2020 [12]. In 
realization of this and the need for Nigeria to 
bridge the digital divide and be positioned as a 
major player in the global information society, the  
Federal Government embarked on a number of 
key initiatives to enhance ICT development in the 
country.  These initiatives which aims at realising  
the two major pillars or main strategic Visions 
(Vision 20:2020, and Economic Recovery and 
Growth Plan (ERGP)) of Nigeria [12] include:  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 142  
 a. the launch of the new National 
Telecommunications Policy in September, 2000 
with NCC as the major regulator of the sub sector;  
b. the development and launch of National 
Policy on Information Technology in 2001 and 
the establishment of NITDA to implement the 
policy, co-ordinate and regulate Information 
Technology development in the country; 
c. the launch of National Space Policy and the 
establishment of the National Space Research and 
Development Agency (NARSDA) to implement 
the Space Policy and the Nigerian Satellite 
programme; 
d. the enactment of the National Broadcasting 
Commission Act and the establishment of NBC 
for the implementation of the National Mass 
Communication Policy with particular reference 
to broadcasting;  
e. the incorporation of NigComSat Ltd. as a 
government owned company established in 2006 
to manage and operate the first geostationary 
communications satellite in sub-Saharan Africa 
called The Nigerian Communications Satellite-1 
(NigComSat-1);  
f. the incorporation in 2006 of Galaxy Backbone, 
Plc as a government owned corporation with the 
official mandate to build and operate a single 
nation-wide IT infrastructure platform to provide 
network services to all Federal Government 
Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs);  
g. establishment of the Ministry of 
Communication Technology in 2011 
 
As a result of the implementation of these key 
initiatives, the Nigeria ICT sector which hitherto 
was characterized by low growth began to enjoy 
rapid growth, particularly in the 
Telecommunication sub-sector, where the 
enactment of the NCC Act, encouraged massive 
private sector participation.  The success recorded  
in the Telecoms sub-sector could not be replicated 
in the other areas, partly because of 
disparate/conflicting policies and laws regulating 
these sub-sectors, lack of essential support 
infrastructures which limits opportunities and 
paucity of skilled manpower in spite of a ready 
and untapped market.  To ameliorate this, the 
Ministry at inception set up a Committee for the 
harmonization of policies in the sector into a 
single National ICT Policy. The National ICT 
Policy was presented to the Federal Executive 
Council (FEC) in August 2012 and has been approved in principle by FEC. Efforts are on-
going to ensure that the grey areas in the ICT 
Policy is sorted in order to secure wholesale 
approval of the Policy by FEC and its subsequent 
implementation. To demonstrate the readiness of 
the federal government in driving the nation’s 
social economic growth and development via the 
platform of ICT, the FEC recently, in August 
2018 approved the National E-Government 
Masterplan implementation document, thereby 
making the e-Government implementation, 
strategy and policy documents a national agenda. 
Prior to this time, an approval had been issues to 
the Nigeria ICT Roadmap for 2020.  Next is the 
need to setup feedback mechanisms to guide 
effective implementation of e-government 
projects. However, it is expected to oversee the 
enforcement of the adoption of e-Government 
programs by MDAs (Federal and State-wide) and 
encourage collaboration amongst them. Thus, the 
need to come up with a legislative framework and 
regulatory policy, especially on the recently 
approved e-government implementation 
framework. 
Thus, the nation is set to be on top gear in the dr ive 
to meet the set timelines in actualizing ERGP 
2020, Vision 20:2020 and Sustainable 
Development Goal being its national mandate and 
agenda. As at today the ICT Industry is the fourth 
largest contributor to the country’s GDP and is the  
fastest growing sector of the economy; growing 
by an average of 30% from one quarter to the 
next.  The industry could be categorised according 
to global clusters of activity such as 
Telecommunications, Value-added services, 
Infrastructure Services, Devices Assembly, Sales 
and Distribution, Equipment sales/Distribution 
and Software Development Sales/Distribution.  
However, the industry in Nigeria is characterized 
by dominance of basic voice and data 
communication, limited manufacturing and 
assembly capabilities for ICT equipment and 
devices; vulnerability and insufficient 
management of critical resources and essential 
facilities and sub-optimal domestic value 
added/local participation in key areas etc. 
The overall objective of the Nigerian Government is 
to fully integrate Information and Communication 
Technologies into the socio-economic 
development of Nigeria, in order to transform the 
country into a knowledge-based economy.  In  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 143  
 increasing the size and relevance of the ICT 
industry and its contribution to the country’s 
development, the Ministry has identified the 
following as priority areas and therefore the focus  
of its activities: 
a. Infrastructure: To connect all Nigerians to a 
high-speed, good quality communications 
network; 
b. Inclusive development: To increase the 
adoption and use of ICTs by all Nigerians in order 
to bridge the digital divide within the country, as  
well as between Nigeria and other nations; 
c. Job creation: Increasing local content in the ICT 
industry and the retention of value within the 
domestic market by encouraging and facilitating 
the participation of Nigerian firms in the sector; 
d. e-Government: To increase transparency 
and efficiency in governance and increase citizen-
government engagement; and  
e. Conducive Regulatory Environment:  To establish 
a stable and predictable environment for attracting  
investment (local and foreign) in the ICT sector. 
 
2.3. Africa within the Global IT Context 
Generally, Africa as a continent is at the bottom o f 
the table in area of IT when compared to other 
continents of the world. With the exception of few 
countries in the continent that have made 
significant progress in the area of information 
technology most of the countries in Africa do not 
even have IT policies. As in the rest of the world,  
Information and Communication Technologies 
(ICT) are set to transform society. This will 
deliver growth and prosperity based on greater 
inclusion, social cohesion and environmental 
sustainability. What was once technological 
infrastructure will become social infrastructure – 
seamless, intuitive and integral, connecting not 
just people but communities, systems, processes 
and intelligence. 
New opportunities will emerge for people to 
collaborate, innovate and participate in ways that 
positively impact their lives and in turn the world . 
Mobile broadband in particular has huge potential 
for Africa, with its large and young population, 
vast landmass and limited infrastructure [13]. 
While the past few decades of IT progress have 
been promising, this has only laid the foundation 
for what is yet to come. Across the continent 
today, infrastructure development continues, 
primarily focused on one of its most basic 
capabilities – connecting people and places. This is a worthy goal being taken on by private 
industry. However, it fails to consider 
technology’s significant potential to drive long-
term inclusive and sustainable social and 
economic development on the continent. As such, 
on its own it will not deliver the outcomes 
required to put the African continent on a path to 
prosperity. 
Universal broadband access connects people to 
information and services. Achieving universal 
access will bring about opportunities to create and  
deliver goods and services at lower fiscal and 
environmental costs than traditional methods. For 
IT to truly achieve its potential, it is imperative  
that governments and policy-makers methodically 
collaborate with private industry to create the 
right type of ecosystem. We particularly need to 
put in place well-defined national broadband 
plans and forums where partnerships among 
stakeholders are explored and enhanced. Policy 
must be inclusive and provide a clear vision that 
favourably positions Africans as global citizens. 
The challenge that many regulators face is not 
necessarily an unwillingness to create these plans,  
but often a limitation of resources and competing 
priorities. It also takes a long time to progress 
from creating a policy to passing it into law, and 
more time still to implement new laws. 
Technological innovation happens at breakneck 
speed, and policy can’t keep up. In addition, 
misconceptions about the scalability, long-term 
possibilities and potential impact of various 
technologies have long-term repercussions. 
Technologies that are harmonized and deployed 
globally benefit from economies of scale and 
interoperability. As such, it is imperative that ke y 
IT stakeholders work with policy-makers to 
ensure they understand the implications of the 
policies they are putting in place, including, for 
example, spectrum allocation after 2020. 
While it is the responsibility of governments to 
develop broadband policies and regulations that 
support their wider goals, partnerships with 
private enterprise can ensure the efficacy of these  
plans, as private sector players have a unique 
insight into the intricacies of various industries.  
This is important, as broadband plans should not 
focus solely on the supply side, covering issues 
such as spectrum, licensing, rights of way, and 
base station emissions. An effective plan must 
also address the demand side, which facilitates the   
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 144  
 development of the entire system – such as 
solutions for e-government, education, health 
services and utilities. Effective broadband policie s 
and regulations translate into market growth in the  
long term. When countries implement broadband 
plans supported by aligned policies and 
regulations, this creates a dynamic business 
environment in which service providers can 
collaborate and compete. Take the case of mobile 
money in Kenya , lauded as a success story 
globally – it is the result of the right type of le gal 
and regulatory framework, which helped create a 
vibrant ecosystem and encouraged private sector 
investment. 
It is hard to overstate the impact IT could have on  
people’s lives in Africa. It could bring about 
social inclusion, expand access to knowledge, 
financial services and healthcare, create new 
business opportunities, and provide more 
consumer choice. IT really could transform the 
continent. But it’s only when everyone involved – 
governments, policy-makers, the private sector, 
industry experts – works together that we can 
maximize the opportunities. If we manage to do 
that, there is no limit to what can be 
accomplished. 
Countries like South Africa, Egypt, Senegal, Kenya 
and recently Rwanda have shown significant 
improvement in the economies by prioritizing IT. 
Recently Rwanda made significant and rapid 
economic growth using IT which further confirms 
that adoption of information technology in 
improving economy cannot be over emphasized. 
Nigeria, like many other African countries has a 
lot to learn from Rwanda.  Just over two decades 
ago, Rwanda was synonymous with extreme civil 
unrest that shocked the world. Now it is 
synonymous with opportunity , and an enthusiastic 
uptake of digital tools that are enabling the East 
African nation to shape a new world for itself. 
Over the last decade, Kenya has experienced 
substantial growth in IT, with the period between 
2013 and 2014 seeing up to 8.4 per cent 
improvement in this sector. According to the 2015 
Kenya Economic Survey, the IT sector in Kenya 
was worth Sh138 billion in 2014 [14]. Since 
2000, Kenya's economy has grown at an average 
of 3.7 per cent. Without IT, this growth would 
have been at 2.8 per cent and per capita income 
would have stagnated. During the first decade of 
the 21st century, IT was responsible for the growth of approximately one-quarter of Kenya's 
GDP. Kenya has been ranked among the top five 
African countries with the fastest growth in 
telecommunication, infrastructure and mobile 
money innovations. The engine behind the rapid 
growth has been mobile telephony which has 
caused a mobile revolution in the country. Mobile 
penetration in Kenya is currently at 82.6 per cent 
with 33.6 million subscribers, proving that the 
mobile phone is fast becoming an important tool 
in transforming lives. IT plays a large role in 
people’s day-to-day lives, addressing challenges 
facing Kenyans in general. In the report Ogutu 
[14] highlights that particular sectors such as 
finance, health, education, agriculture and the 
Government are quickly embracing technology 
for dissemination of information, enhancement of 
service delivery and to reach their customers more 
effectively and efficiently.  
 
2.4. Overview of the Global Production and Use 
of IT  
During the past 30 to 40 years, rapid technological  
innovation fuelled unprecedented advances in 
digital computing capability in the fields of 
semiconductor technology (foundation on which 
the information industry is built), recording 
technology and telecommunication capability 
[15]. Electronics, being the enabling technology 
in the information economy, has opened-up a vast 
range of new forms and concepts of handling 
information. Electronics has, thus, become one of 
the fastest growing industries worldwide. 
Building up capacity in electronics is essential to  
the efficiency of any country’s economy and its 
competitiveness. It also enables a veritable 
resolution in communication and information that 
lies at the root of modern economic development.  
In Nigeria, policy on adoption of Information and 
Communication Technologies was initiated in 
1999, when the civilian regime came into power 
of government. The operations of the licensed 
telecommunication service providers in the 
country has created some well-felt 
macroeconomic effects in terms of job creation, 
faster delivery services, reduced transport costs, 
greater security and higher national output [16]. 
Developing countries are following the export-led 
growth example of newly industrialized Asian 
economies by becoming suppliers and investors in 
IT. However, these technologies continue to be 
exotic and inaccessible to people, especially,  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 145  
 those in the Middle East and Africa. While IT can 
be seen to contribute to economic growth, they 
also introduce new challenges in Africa, 
supporting the notion that growth in its use is 
often thought of as a cause of economic growth 
[17]. In societies that have higher levels of 
income, IT is used to reduce or cut-down on 
increasingly costly human inputs. They are also 
used to forge links between information resources 
and increases due to economic growth. Mansell et 
al. [17] suggests that the challenge would be to 
develop and exploit these emerging opportunities. 
 
2.5. Economic Effects of Information Technology 
Kvochko [18] discusses the effects of IT on 
Economy, which cannot be over emphasized. 
These has been reported in the World Economic 
Forum. Below are some of the positive effects:  
2.5.1. Direct job creation 
The IT sector is, and is expected to remain, one of  
the largest employers. In the US alone, computer 
and information technology jobs are expected to 
grow by 22% up to 2020, creating 758,800 
new jobs . In Australia, building and running the 
new super-fast National Broadband Network will 
support 25,000 jobs annually. Naturally, the 
growth in different segments is uneven. In the US, 
for each job in the high-tech industry,  five 
additional jobs , on average, are created in other 
sectors. In 2013, the global tech market grew by 
8%, creating jobs, salaries and a widening range 
of services and products[18].    
 
 2.5.2. Contribution to GDP growth 
Findings from various countries confirm the 
positive effect of IT on growth. For example, a 
10% increase in broadband penetration is 
associated with a 1.4% increase  in GDP growth in 
emerging markets. In China, this number can 
reach 2.5%. The doubling of mobile data use 
caused by the increase in 3G connections boosts 
GDP per capita growth rate by 0.5%  globally. The 
Internet accounts for 3.4%  of overall GDP in 
some economies. Most of this effect is driven by 
e-commerce – people advertising and selling 
goods online [18].  
 
 2.5.3. Emergence of new services and industries 
Numerous public services have become available 
online and through mobile phones. The transition 
to cloud computing is one of the key trends for 
modernization. The government of Moldova is 
one of the first countries in Eastern Europe and 
Central Asia to shift its government IT infrastructure into the cloud and launch mobile 
and e-services for citizens and businesses. IT has 
enabled the emergence of a completely new 
sector: the app industry. Research  shows that 
Facebook apps alone created over 182,000 jobs in 
2011, and that the aggregate value of the 
Facebook app economy exceeds $$12 billion [18].  
 
 2.5.4. Workforce transformation 
New “microwork” platforms, developed by 
companies like oDesk, Amazon and Samasource, 
help to divide tasks into small components that 
can then be outsourced to contract workers. The 
contractors are often based in emerging 
economies. Microwork platforms allow 
entrepreneurs to significantly cut costs and get 
access to qualified workers. In 2012, oDesk  alone 
had over 3 million registered contractors who 
performed 1.5 million tasks. This trend had 
spillover effects on other industries, such as 
online payment systems. IT has also contributed 
to the rise of entrepreneurship, making it much 
easier for self-starters to access best practices, 
legal and regulatory information, marketing and 
investment resources [18]. 
 
2.5.5. Business innovation 
In the Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD) countries, more than 95% 
of businesses  have an online presence. The 
Internet provides them with new ways of reaching 
out to customers and competing for market share. 
Over the past few years, social media has 
established itself as a powerful marketing tool. IT  
tools employed within companies help to 
streamline business processes and improve 
efficiency. The unprecedented explosion of 
connected devices throughout the world has 
created new ways for businesses to serve their 
customers [18].  
 
 
2.5.6. Improving Public Service through 
Technology 
Many countries around the world including Nigeria 
struggle to deliver basic services to their citizen s 
but things are gradually changing with the aid of 
IT. Here are how some countries have taking 
advantage of IT to deliver basic services to their 
citizens [19]. 
a. Participatory budgeting 
Kumar [19] unveils that in the Democratic Republic 
of Congo , citizens of South Kivu Province are 
using “mSurvey” to obtain information about  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 146  
 budget meetings. Using just their mobile phones, 
they can actively monitor, discover what was 
decided at meetings, and evaluate those decisions 
via online voting. The Participatory Budgeting 
project encourages accountability by actively 
reminding local authorities of their commitments 
while ensuring that citizens are getting services 
they deserve. 
b. Addressing policy challenges 
Residents of Rio Grande Do Sul State, Brazil , are 
able co-design solutions to address problems in 
their city via their “Governor asks” initiative. 
More than 60,000 citizens have submitted 
proposals via mobile, web and face-to-face 
exchanges to address policy challenges [19]. 
c. Checking schools and toilets 
A community monitoring tool on educational 
services in the Philippines  called CheckMySchool 
uses technology to motivate government 
responsiveness for development results. For 
example, locals are using CheckMySchool to 
crowd source reports on the quality of toilets in 
schools. This incentivized government authorities 
to respond to the reports: first with inspections 
and second with funding to improve the poor 
facilities [19]. 
d. Transforming relationship between citizens 
and public services 
Kerala, a beautiful state in India, is using the 
internet to improve its public services. A program 
called Akshaya is starting to transform the 
relationship between citizens and public services. 
Akshaya makes it easy for citizens to obtain a 
driver’s license or keep the government 
accountable. Akshaya “focuses on efficiency, 
equity and transparency of services by reducing 
the burden of physical visits to separate agencies,  
providing ready access to information, 
diminishing the discretion of officials, curtailing  
leakages and corruption in services delivery” [19].  
e. Providing feedback in real time 
Wouldn’t it be helpful if you could easily report i n 
real-time if a teacher doesn’t show up for class? 
OnTrack  is an engagement mechanism that allows 
citizens to provide feedback to government 
implementing agencies of World Bank financed 
programs. OnTrack uses SMS, web and 
interactive mapping  to engage citizens who can 
hold their governments accountable and improve 
services. According to the report, OnTrack is currently being implemented  in Bolivia, Ghana, 
Nepal and Zambia [19]. 
f. Creating an online market for car sales and 
purchases 
In Nigeria, checki.com.ng offers a trusted, reliabl e 
and cost-effective online marketplace for the 
widest range of quality vehicles. They do not sell 
cars directly but, offer a state-of-the-art 
advertising medium for users to buy and sell their 
cars, vans, bikes, trucks and other vehicles. For 
car dealers, importers and individual sellers they 
provide a huge reach of serious buyers and 
support even the first-time buyer in their 
purchasing decision [19]. 
 
2.6. E-Government: An ICT Route for Good 
Governance 
E-governance is regarded as the ICT-enabled route 
to achieving good governance since it integrates 
people, processes, information, and technology in 
the service of governance initiatives or 
businesses. The expected benefits of such public-
sector reforms have been identified as an increase 
in the efficiency of government operations, 
strengthening democracy, enhancing 
transparency, and providing better services to 
citizens and other stakeholders [20]. 
In a report by UNDP, on Governance for 
Sustainable Human Development, as cited in 
Halachmi and Greiling [21], the following core 
characteristics were sufficiently identified and 
highlighted as indicative of good governance:  
1) Participation  
2) Rule of law  
3) Transparency  
4) Responsiveness  
5) Consensus orientation  
6) Equity  
7) Effectiveness and efficiency  
8) Accountability  
9) Strategic vision 
 
In a review, Abu-Shanab [22] provides a definition 
of e-government, which is a summary of 
numerous researches on e-government, as using 
ICT and the Internet capabilities to provide public  
service, improve government’s performance, and 
open participation and empowerment channels to 
serve political or democratic reasons.  
The concept of E-government has been unveiled to 
have expounded into various areas like improving 
government’s performance and empowering  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 147  
 citizens to participate in the democratic process. 
The role of e-government over the years, and in 
many developed countries had continually taken a 
holistic approach to governance towards 
sustainable development. This requiring strategic 
national planning to ensure efficacy, transparency,  
responsiveness, participation, and inclusion in the  
delivery of public services utilizes a notion of 
sustainable development for the people [22]. 
 
2.7.Accountability, Reliability and Transparency 
(ART) in E-Government 
E-government has been argued to have become an 
umbrella term covering all use of information 
technology in government, and IT-based sharing 
of information and conducting transactions within 
the government (G2G), between government and 
businesses (G2B), and between government and 
citizen (G2C) [23]. In their analysis Mistry and 
Jalal [23] maintained that ICT enabled e-
government can improve the transparency of the 
bureaucratic process and therefore, promote 
accountability. Also, E-government has been 
endorsed as a strategy of public sector reform 
based on its impact on improving the managerial 
process. 
ICTs offer countries a new approach to creating 
accountability, transparency and promoting anti-
corruption. Many nations with transparency laws 
have directly tied the implementation of these 
laws to the implementation of ICT-based 
initiatives, often through e-government. Bertot, 
Jaeger and Grimes [24] further argued that ICTs 
can reduce corruption by promoting good 
governance, strengthening reform-oriented 
initiatives, reducing potential for corrupt 
behaviors, enhancing relationships between 
government employees and citizens, allowing for 
citizen tracking of activities, and by monitoring 
and controlling behaviors of government 
employees. To successfully reduce corruption, 
however, ICT-enabled initiatives generally must 
move from increasing information access to 
ensuring rules are transparent, reliable and applie d 
to building abilities to track the decisions and 
actions of government employees [24]. 
The vision of many governments in the use of ICTs 
is as a means to promote efficiency and 
transparency at the same time. ICTs in general 
show promise as an effective means of reducing 
corruption, but social attitudes can decrease the 
effectiveness of ICTs as an anti-corruption tool. Case studies and statistical analyses indicate that  
ICTs hold a great deal of potential for – and are 
already demonstrating benefits in – anti-
corruption, particularly by enhancing the 
effectiveness of internal and managerial control 
over corrupt behaviors and by promoting 
government accountability and transparency [24]. 
In analyzing changes between 1996 and 2006 
corruption data through ICT-enabled e-
government initiatives Bertot, Jaeger and Grimes 
[24] further elaborated with conclusion from one 
study; “implementing e-government significantly 
reduces corruption, even after controlling for any 
propensity for corrupt governments to be more or 
less aggressive in adopting e-government 
initiatives”. 
Transparency deals with the open communication 
between citizens and governments. It refers to the 
effective knowledge with relevant information to 
citizens’ needs. Laws like the right to information , 
as deployed across the world, open access of e-
government information, or the use of ICT and 
the Internet to promote public information are 
related to transparency. Researches revealed that 
transparency has a major role in reducing 
uncertainties for governments. Transparency is 
not as easy to implement and adhere to as 
perceived; it requires training public officers to 
respond to information requirements [22]. 
 
3. Materials and Methods  
In respond to the research questions, a four-step 
research methodology was adopted and thus had 
been implemented. Firstly, the research objectives 
were established which guided the setting of the 
research questions. Secondly, an appropriate 
conceptual and theoretical framework for the 
research was adopted from the existing works of 
past researchers. Thirdly, it includes a brief 
review of relevant and past literatures. Finally, t he 
fourth step of the general methodology is the 
deployment of a quantitative approach involving 
survey design in the form of a questionnaire, 
distribution, collation and computational analysis 
using, frequency distribution and percentage 
method, Chi-Square, t-Test, Analysis of Variance 
(ANOVA), and Multiple Regression, 
Discriminant Analyses using statistical packages 
such as Excel, and SPSS.  The results of the 
quantitative analysis were discussed and 
interpreted in relation to the key issues of the 
research.  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 148  
 The total population in this research was 90 
respondents. From the named population, 60 
responses (82%) were obtained from the selected 
73 persons (sample size) to constitute the required  
respondents. These constitute a fair representation  
of the Stakeholders from Transportation, Services, 
Finance and Hospitality sector.   
4. Results and Discussions 
4.1. General Presentation and Analysis of Data: 
The general statistical data of the completed and 
returned questionnaires showing the frequency and 
percentage distribution of the respondents against 
each questionnaire question, and presentations 
based on some relevant classifications in 
furtherance of the focus of this research work have  
been provided.   
4.1.1. Based on the Size of Organisation 
The relationship between the ICT impact on 
development and the size of the organisation can be  
explained by considering the average responses of 
respondents under this classification, which 
addresses factors contributing to the economic 
growth and development  – “Contributions”, factors 
responsible for easier access to ICT infrastructure  
and services  – “Access”, factors limiting  the use  of 
ICT – “Limitations”, the use of ICT as a tool to 
combat hinderances to economic growth and 
development – “Combat Tools”,  and the impact of 
ICT on Trade and long-term competitiveness– 
“Trade & More,  shown in Table 1:

For details of the results and source of data, pleas e refer to the field survey 
statistical data  
 
Research result in the Table suggests that 
there is an improvement on ICT impact on growth 
and development, as the size of the organisation 
increases. This is evident by comparing the 
average of responses by respondents under the 
various sized organisations. Small-sized 
organisation (between 10 to 50 employees) 
indicates 3.642857 degree to which ICT 
contribute to the economy as represented in 
question 12 to 15 (refer to Questionnaire) which 
addresses the positive effects of ICT to enable 
improvement in Public Service and cut down in 
the cost of governance, creation of some well-felt 
macroeconomic effects in terms of faster delivery 
services and reduced transport costs, increasing 
role as one of the highest job creators in recent 
times, and increase in GDP growth in the Nigerian 
capital markets. While medium sized, and large 
sized organisations report 2.21094 and 2.1309523 levels of ICT contribution to national economic 
growth and development respectively. Therefore, 
the approximate of 2.13 level for large-sized 
organisation tend more to the “enable” degree 
(represented by 2), followed by the 2.21 for the 
medium sized. This implies that small-sized 
organisations with 3.64 (i.e. less than enable) on 
the degree to which ICT contribute to the 
economy, rarely contribute or make some 
significant impact in contributing in national 
economic growth and development. Thus, as 
organisations increases in size, their role in 
contributing to the economy through dependency 
and use of ICT to support their business activities  
becomes paramount. 
Similarly, the average values of 2.71, 1.97 
and 1.81 levels or degrees responses by small, 
medium and large sized organisations 
respectively, probes on the extent to which there  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 149  
 has been significant development of Nigeria 
Industries on enterprises’ trades and long-term 
competitiveness as a result of the accelerating 
impact of ICT growth (refer to question 22 of 
Questionnaire form in Appendix C). Also, the 
average values 3.21, 1.88- and 1.83-degrees 
responses for the use of ICT as a combat tools 
against major hindrances to the economy, 
indicative of these small. Medium and large-sized 
organisations respectively, suggests that large-
sized organisations have greater degree to which 
they strategize, deploy and use ICT as a vital tool  
to combat major hindrances to national growth 
and development. This would include among 
others ICT deployment to government services 
which has played a vital role in driving 
accountability, reliability and transparency among 
public servants and institutions in Nigeria as 
compared to small-sized organisation.  
Therefore, as organisations increase in size, 
the result indicates that the need to acquire, 
depend on or use more ICT or electronic hardware 
and software to support it communications and 
Information Systems amongst its complex work 
environments both in and out of the organisation 
with inevitable business opportunities or 
challenges in the global marketplace, implies 
greater dependence on ICT to meet its’ corporate purpose of existence, shareholder’s wealth 
creation, and overall national economic growth 
and development. Thus, there is a relationship 
existing between ICT impact on national 
economic development and the size of 
organisation. 
 
4.1.2. General on ICT Strategy, Adoption & 
Deployment 
The relationship between the impact of ICT 
strategy, adoption and deployment, such as ICT 
strategic partnership and collaborative 
relationship, core competencies, benefiting from 
ICT resources, and ICT corporate value and 
wealth creation among organisations with relative 
to the size of organisation generally affirms that 
larger-sized organisations tend to depend more on 
the expertise of others in support of their 
processes, services and activities, or as a measure  
for adopting or deploying their own ICT strategy 
through the harnessing of the competences of 
other organisations to improve their corporate 
image. This assertion stands to be justified by the  
result of the statistics of percentage response of 
respondents who said “YES” or “NO” to the 
questions on general strategy for deployment as 
represented by Figure 1. 
 
 
 
Figure 1: ICT strategy for adoption against size of  organisation 
The result indicates that 25% respondents under 
small-sized organisations said “YES” to 
participation in and benefiting from collaborative 
project with other organizations. They also 
confirmed that offering of their expertise or core 
ICT competences produced a mirroring effect on their corporate image and ensured wealth creation. 
The rest 75% however said “NO” to this. With 
medium size firms, up to 83% answered “YES”, 
while the rest 17% said “NO” to these concerns. 
Large-sized organisations however have 76% and 
24% respondents saying “YES” and “NO” to these  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 150  
 questions respectively. This reveals that 
collaborations are more among medium and large-
sized organisation than is among those of small-
sized. 
The 83% “YES” response from medium-sized 
organisations in comparison with the lesser 76% of 
those from the large sized suggest the higher 
dependency on the pulling together of ICT expertise  
along with impact on corporate image collaborative 
alliance mirror on the business or project 
undertakings of medium-sized firms to ensure and 
sustain competitiveness in the marketplace. 
4.2. P  Presentation and Analysis of Data According  to 
Tests of Hypotheses 
4.2.1. Based on the Size of Organisation Hypothesis 1: 
HO1: There is no relationship between the ICT impac t for 
economic growth and development, and the size of 
organisation. [Chi-Square] 
The statistical data on the frequency distribution of 
the responses of the respondents under the differen t 
classified sizes of organization who responded to 
the ICT impact for economic growth and 
development are relevant in conducting this test. 
The data presented in table 2 following, provides 
the sum and various response options with the 
frequency of responses for this question set agains t 
the different sizes of organization.

Thus, The Calculated Value of Chi-Square Is 10.10. 
This Is Obtained from The Calculations of The 
Required Expected Frequency, And Frequency 
Deviation/ Chi-Square Computation Under Test of 
Hypothesis 1: HO1 Within Table A-1 (Refer to 
Appendix A of This Report) Respectively.  
 
Decision Rule: Since the Calculated Value of Chi-Square 
10.10 is Less than The Tabulated Value of Chi-
Square 15.51 As Graphically Illustrated in Figure 
1, The Alternative Hypothesis Is Hereby 
Rejected. And So, There Is No Relationship 
between the ICT Impact for Economic Growth 
and Development and the Size of Organization

4.2.2. Medium-Sized Organisations Versus Small- Siz ed Organization 
Hypothesis 2:  
HO2: Medium-sized organisations do not significantl y deploy ICT for economic  
impact more than small- sized organization. [ANOVA]  
 
The following representations will suffice to 
guide the setup of the relevant tables for this 
testing: 
I. Factors contributing to the economic growth 
and development – “Contributions”,  
II. Factors responsible for easier access to ICT 
infrastructure and services – “Access”,  
III. Factors limiting the use of ICT– 
“Limitations”,  
IV. The use of ICT as a tool to combat 
hinderances to economic growth and development 
– “Combat Tools”, and  
V. The impact of ICT on Trade and long-term 
competitiveness– “Trade & More”  
To test this hypothesis, tables 3 and 4 were used. 
The responses in table 3 represented X1 column 
while the responses in table 4 represented the X2 
column. 
The responses by Small-Sized Organisations on 
the ICT impact for economic growth and 
development can be obtained by considering the 
average responses of respondents under this 
classification, which addresses factors such as 
“Contributions”, “Access”, “Limitations”, 
“Combat Tools”, and “Trade & More” shown in

5. Conclusions 
5.1. Concluding Statements 
While Technology on its own does not solve human 
or social problems, yet the availability and 
deployment of information and communication 
technologies remain necessary pre-requisite for 
economic and social development among nations in 
our world. Just as electricity is to the industrial  era, 
so is ICT as the direct functional equivalent to 
information age, and the emerging knowledge 
society. The survey covered in this research 
conveys ICT and its deployment within corporate 
organisations, or any tier/ arm of government as 
motivator or driver of the Nigerian economy.  
ICTs are enablers for economic growth and 
development because of their crosscutting nature, 
thus impacting all sectors. This research has 
demonstrated and verified the place of ICT to drive  
and control the forces contributing to the economic  
growth and development, and easier access to 
essential infrastructure and services. Further, it 
revealed factors limiting the use of ICT as well as  
the relevance of ICT as a tool in combating 
hinderances to economic growth and development, and facilitating industrialisation via impact on tr ade 
and long-term competitiveness. The platform of 
intensive ICT infrastructure stimulates the overall  
impacts on national economic growth and 
development, and further drive accountability, 
reliability and transparency (ART) unto good 
governance.  
 
5.2. Recommendations 
Sequel from the results and implications of the 
research findings, and the conclusions in this repo rt, 
the following recommendations are proposed: 
I. Provision of affordable broadband 
infrastructure – The recent FGN National 
Broadband plan is highly commended and 
implementation should be given top priority. We 
cannot achieve the aim of e-governance from 
present slow and expensive Internet access. Thus, 
other affordable broadband infrastructure options 
should be explored and invested in, as this is an 
enabler for economic and social growth in a digital  
economy.  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 157  
 II. Proper ICT funding and budgetary 
allocation should be ensured. The initial capital 
investment for ICT infrastructure is usually high. 
There is therefore need for adequate government 
funding and budget to cater for provision of 
infrastructure, support and maintenance costs. The 
digital divide is rooted in the lack of e-
infrastructure, which has hindered information-use 
and knowledge-creation.  
III. ICT professionals should be engaged to man 
ICT roles in organisations or critical public offic es. 
Thus, the need for the establishment of ICT units o r 
departments in Organisations. This setup should be 
made mandatory in all ministries, departments and 
agencies (MDAs) at the Federal, State and Local 
government levels of government.  
IV. Provision of steady power supply – 
Adequate power supply and backups should be 
ensured across the nation; especially for the MDAs 
where e-government, e-health, e-education and e-
commerce services are deployed. 
V. Use of Standard System Development Best 
Practices – Most ICT projects fail due to not 
following standard processes for System 
Development Life Cycle. All government organs 
should have strategic plans for digitisation well 
aligned with National ICT Policies for their 
operations. 
VI. ICT systems should be incorporated and 
practised as core organisational culture to promote  
e-governance, e-health, e-commerce, e-business, 
etc.; multi-organisational collaboration and 
virtualisation to attain and/or sustain corporate 
competitiveness and national socio-economic 
development in the emerging digitalized 
marketplace. 
VII. National project and programmes should be 
strategically managed using an advanced ICT 
innovation, such as Cloud Computing, to ensure 
effectiveness and efficiency to optimally meet 
customer’s customized value proposition as well as 
stakeholder’s value creation.  
VIII. Multinational and Project based 
organisations should maximize the inherent 
potential benefits for economic value creation 
through the digitisation of all project deliverable s for efficient inter-organisational IS management, 
using the support of intensive ICT infrastructure. 
 
5.3. Directions for Further Research 
Some of these literature surveys could stimulate th e 
basis for future research. This research hereby 
suggests further research issues as follows:  
I. The role of Information and Communication 
Technology (ICT) in driving accountability, 
reliability and transparency (ART) of government 
business. 
II. Evaluation and analysis of the risks and 
threats associated the deployment and adoption of 
ICT in finance-based business environment. 
III. Investigation of the factors militating against 
ICT service adoption and its impact on the Nigerian  
economy.  
IV. Analyses of the relevance of ICT for 
improved workforce productivity and economic 
growth through creation of virtual groups platforms  
such as home-based work, and telework, distributed 
teams, and other communities of practice.

Abstract 
This study investigates the influence of parental c are on academic performance of students usingOsaah 
Community Secondary School Umuahia North Local Gove rnment Area, Abia State, as the study locale. 
With the aid of the study objectives, four hypothes es were formulated in the study. The descriptive su rvey 
design was adopted in the study. A sample size of 2 07 was adopted from the population of the study usi ng 
Taro Yamene formula for sample size determination. Purposive and proportionate sampling techniques 
were variously applied in the study at different st ages. The summation of all the responses were prese nted 
using frequency distribution tables and simple perc entages, while the Chi-square statistical tool was used 
to test the hypotheses formulated in the study. The  test statistics reveals among others that, there i s a 
significant relationship between the provision of b asic needs by parents and student’s engagement in 
school activities. The study concludes that, parent al care leads to student’s academic performance in 
OssahCommunitySecondary School, Umuahia North Local  Government Area, AbiaState. The study 
recommends among others that, parents should be sen sitized on the need for provision of basic needs su ch 
as reading and writing materials in the form of tex tbooks and notebooks to their children, as these wo uld 
motivate them to engagement in school activities su ch as drama club, cultural club, press club, debati ng 
club which is a panacea to the actualization of acad emic pursuit.

Introduction 
Parents have vital roles to play in the lives of th eir 
children. The training and development of a child 
by acquiring knowledge, skills, values, and eloquen t 
behaviour in school in most cases are placed in the  
hands of parents. The love and care parents shower 
on their children determine the future of their 
children towards actualizing academic prowess. 
Academic performance is an important parameter 
used in measuring students’ success or failure in 
school. Student’s poor performance in school has 
become a common concern of parents, teachers, and 
counselors. According to Bell (2002), parents 
devote lots of resources to their children’s educat ion 
because they believe that, excellence in academic 
performance leads to the attainment of contentment 
and stability in life. Uwaifo (2008) attributes the  
cause of poor performance of children towards 
academic pursuit to a combination of personal and 
institutional factors. The personal factors include  
the level of individual’s intelligence, knowledge, 
and ability while the institutional factors are fam ily 
or parental influence on the child.  
Anything that affects the study environment of a 
child’s will possibly affect the child’s education or disposition to education.  Ella, Akpabio, and 
Samson-Akpan (2015) posit that, several factors 
such as study habits, self-concept, school 
environment, government, teachers’ qualification 
and teaching skills, parents’ social class and 
educational status, and parents’ financial inputs, 
have been identified as factors that influence 
student’s academic performance but vary from 
individual to individual and country to country. 
The effect of parental care on a child at any given  
time cannot be over emphasized. The home is very 
germane and crucial to a child’s well-being and 
development in later life. The family is the primar y 
cell of society where the child’s upbringing begins . 
According to Jeynes (2007), a person’s principles 
established since childhood are like letters engrav ed 
in the bark of a young tree which grow, enlarge 
with it and making its integral part. Children are not 
easy to be raised. They don’t come with guidelines 
or instructions. What they do come with, is a cruci al 
set of physical and emotional needs that must be 
met and failure of parents to meet these specific 
needs can have wide-ranging and long-lasting  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 163  
 negative effects especially on the children’s 
academic performance (Jeynes, 2007).  
In his own reaction, Epistein (2001) maintained 
that, parents in the home are children’s first teac her. 
As a child moves from infant to toddler and then to  
a pre-schooler, he learns how to speak, listen, wri te, 
and read which latter develop the child 
academically. Greater parental involvement at early  
stage in a child’s learning, positively affects the  
child’s school activities and academic performance. 
Topor, Keane, Shelton, and Calkins (2010) assert 
that, families whose children are doing well in 
school, establish a daily family routine by providi ng 
time and a quiet place to study with their children , 
monitor the children’s out-of-school activities (fo r 
example setting limits on television watching, 
reduce time of playing, and monitor the groups of 
friends their children interact with). The families  
also, encourage their children’s development and 
progress in school (for example, maintaining a 
worm and supportive home, showing interest in the 
children’s progress at school, helping them with 
homework, and discussing the value of a sound 
education and future career with the children). In 
the same vein, Katz, Kaplan, and Buzukashvily 
(2011) maintained that, parental involvement such 
as supporting a child’s social and psychological 
needs in school, showing keen interest towards 
the child’s attitudinal behaviour in school, and th e 
child’s commitment towards learning, positively 
relates to a child’s motivation for doing homework 
and assignments given and performing brilliantly 
in examinations.  
Hoover-Dempsey (2005) avers that, parents’ 
positive attitude towards their children’s 
education, influences the children’s involvement 
and participation in school activities thereby 
helping them to acquire skills, values, knowledge, 
attitudes, which is a roadmap for youth’s 
empowerment and national development. Izzo and 
Fendrich (2005) contend that, parents’ involvement 
through the provision of material needs of a child in 
school, disciplining the child when he or she goes 
astray, frequent parent-teacher contact, and ensurin g 
that the child learns at home, enables the child to  
relate gleaming with students and teachers which in  
turn, uplifts the child’s behaviour and performance  
in school. 
Valentino, Dubois, and Cooper (2004) maintained 
that at home, parental care clearly and consistentl y has significant effects on student’s performance in  
school and adjustment which far outweigh other 
forms of achievement. When a child has caring 
parents to support his or her learning, the child 
tends to succeed not just in school, but throughout  
his or her life time.They continued that, “the most  
accurate predictor of a student’s performance in 
school is not income or social status, but the exte nt 
to which parents are able to create an enabling 
environment at home that would encourage 
children’s learning and to express high expectation s 
for their children’s future.” 
Rothestein (2004) asserts that, parents of differen t 
occupation often have different ways of child 
rearing, different ways on how to discipline their 
children, and different ways of reacting to their 
children. These differences do not express 
themselves consistently as expected in the case of 
every family rather, they influence the average 
tendencies of families for different occupational 
classes.  Hill and Taylor (2004) argued that, socio -
economic status of parents do not only affect their  
children’s academic performance, but also makes it 
possible for children from low background to 
compete with their counterparts from high socio-
economic background in the same academic 
environment.  
 
Statement of the Problem 
People’s attestations and reactions have shown that , 
there appears to be linkage between parental care 
and academic performance of students in secondary 
schools. For instance, parental care through the 
provision of basic needs, moral instructions, and 
discipline, appears to contribute or make students to 
perform excellently in school activities, prompts 
them to be serious with their studies, and enables 
them to create cordial relationship with their 
teachers in order to concentrate and understand 
what is being thought in the class. On the other 
hand, some people allege that, no matter the level of 
concern, love, and care parents render to their 
children still, their performance in school activit ies 
and studies, and attitudinal behaviour in order to 
understand what is being thought in the class 
remain pitiable. It is in light of the above situat ions 
that this study investigates the influence of paren tal 
care on academic performance of students using

Review of Related Literature  
The Concept of Parental Care 
Parental care is a behavioural and evolutionary 
strategy adopted by some animals, involving a 
parental investment  being made to the evolutionary 
fitness  of offspring. Patterns of parental care are 
widespread and highly diverse across the animal 
kingdom (Kokko and Jennions, 2008). Gonzalez-
Voyer and Kolm (2010), defined parental care as 
any form of parental behaviour that increases the 
fitness of the offspring. This definition of parent al 
care includes preparation of nests and burrows, 
production of large heavily yoked eggs (which are 
generally associated with increased hatchability an d 
survival of the young), care of eggs or the young 
inside or outside the parent’s body, provisioning o f 
young before and after birth, and care of the 
offspring after nutritional independence.  
Parental care include activities like helping child ren 
in reading, encouraging them to do their homework, 
monitoring their activities at home and outside the  
four walls of their home, and providing coaching 
services for improving their learning in school. 
Traditional definitions of parental care are limite d 
to school-related activities, and sociologists have  
made the distinction between home-based activities 
e.g.helping children with homework, discussing 
children’s experiences at school, and school-based 
activities such as parent’s communicating with 
school authorities and participation in school-base d 
activities (Sui-Chu and Williams, 2006). 
 
 
The Concept of Academic Performance 
Academic performance has to do with what learning 
is able to accomplish by execution of classwork in 
the school. Stiggings (2001) sees academic 
performance as something a learner does or achieve 
at school, college or university, in class, in a 
laboratory or fieldwork. In his own reaction 
Wentling (2000) posits that, academic performance 
refers to the achievement of individuals’ objective   
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 165  
 to various types of knowledge and skills. The 
objectives are established based on the age, prior 
learning and capacity of individuals with regards t o 
education, socialization, and qualification. 
Academic performance is the outcome of 
educational prowess mainly by a student. It is the 
extent to which a student, teacher or institution 
has achieved its’ educational goals. Thus, 
performance is characterized by performance on 
tests associated with coursework and the 
performance of students on other types of 
examinations. Academic performance is an 
important parameter used in measuring students’ 
success or failure in a particular subject. Poor 
performance of students has become a common 
concern of parents, legislators, teachers, counselo rs, 
sociologists and psychologists. Parents devote a lo t 
of resources to their children’s education because 
they believe that good academic performance will 
provide a stable future for them (Bell, 2002).  
Empirical Review 
 
Hafiz,Tehsin, Malik, Muhammad, 
Muhammad(2013)carried out a studyon Parental 
Involvement and Academic Achievement: A Study 
of Secondary School Students of Lahore Pakistan. 
A total of 150 students (boys and girls) of 9th cla ss 
of secondary schools (public and private) were 
sampled. Four schools were selected through simple 
random sampling technique. The survey 
questionnaire was used as a tool for data collectio n. 
The Chi-square test was employed to test the 
significance of the association between the 
independent variable (level of parental involvement 
in the children’s academic activities) and the 
dependent variable (level of children’s academic 
achievement). After the data analyzes, it was found  
that parental involvement in the children’s 
academic activities has significance effect in the 
level of children’s academic achievement. 
Chohan and Khan (2010) conducted a study on 
‘The Impact of Parental Support on Academic 
Performance andSelf Concept of the Students’. The 
aims of this study were to examine the linkage 
between academic achievement and educational 
support provided to the child at home and, to 
determine whether this support directly or indirect ly 
affects the child's self concept. The study was 
descriptive in nature and quantitative methodology 
was applied to achieve the study objectives. Data were collected from a sample of 305 grade 4 
students in the urban primary and elementary public  
schools.  Following the collection of data and 
coding of completed surveys, the statistical analys is 
was applied using Statistical Package for the Socia l 
Sciences (SPSS). The study reveals that, parents’ 
contribution to their children's education has a 
consistent and positive effect on their academic 
achievement and self-concept. 
Apodaca, Gentling, Steinhaus, and 
Rosenberg(2015)carried out a study on  ‘Parental 
Involvement as a Mediator of Academic 
Performance Among Special Education Middle 
School Students’.Using a specially developed 
questionnaire, a sample of 82 parents (representing  
all children enrolled in a special education 
programme in a charter middle school in a diverse, 
urban environment) reported on the nature and 
extent of their involvement in their children’s 
schoolwork. These ratings were then compared with 
their children’s actual grades in four core classes  
over the course of the academic year. Echoing 
earlier findings with general population students, a 
significant relationship was found between parental  
expectations and overall GPA. Since Resource 
Room students had significantly lower grades than 
Special Day students (those in a self-contained, 
non-inclusive classroom), parental communication 
and general involvement were negatively associated 
with academic performance, as had been the case 
earlier with similar groups of struggling students.  
Findings reveal a more complex relationship 
between parental involvement and academic 
achievement for special education students.  
Ogunshola and Adewale (2012) conducted a 
research on ‘The Effects of Parental Socio-
Economic Status on Academic Performance of 
Students in Selected Schools in Edu L.G.A, Kwara 
State, Nigeria’. Samples were obtained from one 
hundred and eighty (180) students randomly 
selected from three secondary schools. The four 
factors that were examined and statistically 
analyzed were: parental socio-economic status, 
parental educational background, parental 
educational qualification, and students’ health 
statuses. The hypotheses formulated for the study 
were tested using t-test, analysis of variance 
(ANOVA), and pair-wise turkey test comparison at 
0.05 level of significance. The study indicates tha t 
parental socio-economic status and parental  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 166  
 educational background do not have significant 
effect on academic performance of the students. 
However, the parental educational qualification and  
health status of the students were identified to ha ve 
statistical significant effect on the academic 
performance of students. The study recommends 
among others that, social and economic policies 
should be put in place to enable children from 
parents of low economic status to have equal 
opportunity of advancing in education.  
 
Theoretical Framework  
In this study,theparental attachment theory is 
adopted as the theory suitable to guide this study.  
Parental attachment theory was propounded by John 
Bowlby in 1969 and developed by Ainsworth in 
1973. Bowlby’s postulation on ‘Parental 
Attachment Theory’ states that,the child forms a 
strong emotional bond with another person 
(caregiver) during childhoodwith lifelong 
consequences. The implication and relevance of 
parental attachment theory to this study is that, 
sensitive and emotionally availableparenting helps 
the child to form a secure attachment style which 
fosters a child’s socio-emotionaldevelopment and 
well being. Less sensitive and emotionally 
availableparenting or neglect of a child’s needs ma y 
result in insecure forms of attachment style,which is 
a risk factor for a child’s enhancement.  
Parents can now see the necessity of forming 
secureattachment bond with their children. Such 
bond would enable their children to end up 
withsecure achievement and state of mind later in 
life. Parents should know and understandthe basic, 
social, and psychological needs of their children i n 
school through the provision of reading and writing  
materials in the form of textbooks and notebooks to  
their children, administering moral instructions in  
the form of advice, counseling their children, and as 
well as establish effective partnership with teache rs 
for proper monitoring of their children in school. 
These would motivate the children to engagement 
in school activities such as drama club, cultural 
club, press club, and debating club which is a 
panacea to actualizing academic excellence. 
Research Methodology 
 The study is carried out in 
OssahCommunitySecondary School, Umuahia North Local Government Area, AbiaState. For the 
purpose of this study, the survey research design 
was adopted. The survey research design was 
adopted to investigate the relationship between the  
variables ‘parental care’ and ‘academic 
performance’ of students in Ossah Community 
Secondary School (the indicators of independent 
variable, ‘parental care’ are; provision of basic 
needs by parents; moral instructions from parents; 
and discipline from parents. While the indicators o f 
dependent variable, ‘academic performance’ are; 
students engagement in school activities; students 
seriousness in studies; and student-teacher 
relationship). Therefore, the data required for thi s 
study must be subjective and hence, be collected 
from students and that is why the survey method is 
adopted. The population of the study is (429) 
(population gotten from the Vice Principal 
Academics). For effective coverage, Taro Yamane 
formula for sample size determination was applied 
and (0.05) percent was chosen as the level of 
significance or margin of error allowable. Sample 
size of (207) was chosen for the study. In choosing  
the sample for the study, the purposive and 
proportionate sampling techniques were variously 
applied at different stages. The purposive sampling  
technique was used to select students in the senior  
classes (SS1, SS2, and SS3). This is to ensure that  
the questions in the questionnaire are well 
understood and answered correctly while the 
proportionate sampling technique was employed in 
assigning the number of respondents to be selected 
from each of the classes since the classes do not 
have equal number of population. The primary and 
secondary sources of data collection were used in 
this study. The primary sources consist of 
questionnaire which was structured in Likert 
modified four-point response scale, while the 
secondary sources consist of information from text 
books and journal articles. Out of (207) copies of 
questionnaire distributed, (196) copies were 
successfully retrieved. Data collected from the fie ld 
were presented using frequency distribution tables 
and percentages (%), while the Chi-square (x2) 
statistical tool (manual) was used to test the 
hypotheses formulated in the study.

Table 1 shows the distribution of respondents on 
provision of basic needs to students and students’ 
engagement to school. In question number 1, out of 
196 respondents, (26.5%) strongly agreed that, thei r 
parents provide you with basic needs such as 
reading and writing materials to school, (58.2%) 
agreed, (9.2%) disagreed, while (6.1%) strongly 
disagreed. In question number 2, out of 196 
respondents, (25%) strongly agreed that, the 
provision of reading and writing materials such as 
textbooks and notebooks by their parents enables 
them to attend classes and participate in their 
examinations, (56.6%) agreed, (11.2%) disagreed, 
while (7.1%) strongly disagreed. In question 
number 3, out of 196 respondents, (31.1%) strongly 
agreed that, payment of school fees and providing money for items such as snacks and soft drinks 
make students to participate in school activities l ike 
inter-house sports and football competitions, 
(47.4%) agreed, (13.8%) disagreed, while (7.6%) 
strongly disagreed. In question number 4, out of 19 6 
respondents, (37.7%) strongly agreed that, provision  
of new school uniforms, sandals/shoes, motivates 
them to belong to clubs/associations such as drama 
club, cultural club, press club, debating club in 
school, (15.5%) agreed, (6.1%) disagreed, while 
(4.6%) strongly disagreed. From the above table, it  
infers that the respondents responded greatly that 
provision of basic needs to students contributes to  
students’ engagement in school activities in

Discussion of Findings  
The result of the first hypothesis reveals that, th ere 
is a significant relationship between provision of 
basic needs by parents and student’s engagement in 
school activities in OssahCommunitySecondary 
School, Umuahia North Local Government Area, 
AbiaState. This is in line with Epistein (2001) who  
stressed that, parents in the home are children’s f irst 
teacher. As a child moves from infant to toddler an d 
then to a preschooler, he learns how to speak, list en, 
write, and read which latter develop the child 
academically. Greater parental involvement at early  
stage in a child’s learning, positively affects the  
child’s school activities and academic performance. 
The result of the second hypothesis reveals that, 
there is a significant relationship between moral 
instructions from parents and student’s seriousness  
in studies in OssahCommunitySecondary School, 
Umuahia North Local Government Area, AbiaState. 
This is in consonance with the view of Valentino, 
Dubois, and Cooper (2004) that at home, parental 
care clearly and consistently has significant effec ts 
on student’s performance in school and adjustment 
which far outweigh other forms of achievement. 
When a child has caring parents and families to 
support his or her learning, the child tends to 
succeed not just in school, but throughout his or h er 
life time. The result of the third hypothesis reveals that, th ere 
is a significant relationship between discipline fr om 
parents and student-teacher relationship in 
OssahCommunitySecondary School, Umuahia 
North Local Government Area, AbiaState. This 
agrees with Izzo and Fendrich (2005) who stressed 
that, parents’ involvement through the provision of  
material needs of a child in school, discipline the  
child when he or she goes astray in school, frequen t 
parent-teacher contact, and ensure the child’s 
learning at home, enables the child to relate glowi ng 
with the students and teachers which in turn, uplif ts 
the child’s behaviour and performance in school. 
 
Conclusion and Recommendations 
From the findings, the study concludes that parenta l 
care leads to student’s academic performance in 
OssahCommunitySecondary School, Umuahia 
North Local Government Area, AbiaState. For this 
reason, the study recommends that;  
1. Parents should be sensitized on the need for the 
provision of basic needs such as reading and writin g 
materials in the form of textbooks and notebooks to  
their children, as these would motivate them to 
engagement in school activities such as drama club,  
cultural club, press club, debating club which is a  
panacea to the actualization of academic pursuit. 
2. Parents and guardians need re-orientation and 
proper enlightenment on the need for 
administering moral instructions in the form of 
advice, and counseling to their children so that th e 
children will be serious with their studies by 
reading their books always as well as doing their 
homework/assignments which is a roadmap to the 
attainment of academic prowess. 
3. Parents should endeavour to discipline their 
children whenever they receive any report against 
them in school as well as establish effective 
partnership with the teachers for proper 
monitoring of their children in school as this 
would help students to develop good relationship 
with their teachers and concentrate to understand 
the teachings of their teachers which in turn 
enhances their academic performance in school. 
4. students  as  their  own  children;  try  by  all  
means  to  meet  the  students’  academic  social  
needs.

This paper models the long run determinant of agrib usiness performance in Nigeria within the period 
1970-2016. The data for the analysis are from data base of Central Bank of Nigeria and World Bank 
Economic indicator 2017.It employs Auto Regressive L ag /bounds testing method for the empirical 
modeling. The outcome shows that ARDL/Bounds testin g technique is the most fitted for modeling 
agribusiness performance and its determinants in Nig eria.  Capital, inflation, labor and non oil export  are 
the major long run determinants of agribusiness per formance. The paper recommends that Government 
should formulate and implement policies that will e nable sustainable and inclusive agribusiness value 
chain and technology diffusion.     
Key words: Agribusiness performance , and Long run determinants, macro economic determinants, auto 
regressive lag, functional relationship. 
 
1.0 Introduction 
Agribusiness is an aggregate of subsectors of 
agriculture production and proximate agro-allied 
industries [21]. According [4], Agribusiness 
emphasizes the interdependence of the various sub-
sectors within the production chain, which aims at 
adding value to both the consumer and the 
producer. This suggests that for agribusiness to 
perform successfully in an economy, the interlink 
between the subsectors  must be properly activated 
and coordinated in- order to create a continuous 
flow of activities, information sharing, goods and 
services preceded by a  clear understanding of the 
functional relationship between agribusiness 
performance and the affecting  macroeconomic 
variables. 
 The need to understand the behavior of the 
macroeconomic variables that affect the 
performance of agribusiness is necessary as to 
enable their prediction since what affects the 
variables at the long run affects agribusiness 
performance [10] It follows that a design of an 
appropriate model that can show the true functional  
relationship between agribusiness performance and 
macroeconomic determinants is necessary since 
variables linked by theoretical relationship should  
have a long run co integration for their relationsh ip 
to have a meaningful or valid result. This paper 
creates the appropriate model that enables the 
prediction of long term functional relationship between agribusiness performance and 
macroeconomic determinants. 
In doing so, there is the need to briefly discuss t he 
conceptual and theoretical framework of 
agribusiness performance which guides the model 
formulation. This is the subject discussed in secti on 
two (literature review). Model specification and 
estimation are carried out in section three. Sectio n 
four presents results and discussions. The paper 
concludes in section five with some policy 
recommendation 
 
 2.0   LITERATURE REVIEW   
2.1 Conceptual/theoretical framework 
The concept of economic performance is based on 
the studies in organization theory of increasing 
returns to scale, which operating principle is, 
reduction in the cost of unit input resulting into 
increased output that is more than returns per unit  
input realized through operational efficiency [22].  
This connotes results and achievement of objectives  
or set goals with greater efficiency and 
effectiveness. According to [3], for an economic 
sector or a firm to achieve performance, its strate gy 
or goal achievement plan must fall within the 
concept of value and wealth creation at a minimum 
cost. In other words, it must formulate strategies 
that will enable goal(s) achievement.  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 176  
  The concept of agribusiness performance in 
Nigeria implies its capacity to achieve the economi c 
objectives of food and fiber need sustainability, 
employment to the teeming youth population, value 
creation and indeed an alternate or complementary 
source of revenue to the oil and gas industry. 
The weakness of Nigerian economy is relaying 
mainly on oil and gas revenues that manifested 
during the 1980s crude oil price crash at the 
international market and the global financial crisi s 
of 2008. The economic challenge not only exposes 
the weak base of Nigeria economy but also 
emphasizes the critical role agribusiness plays in 
Nigeria’s economy. Agribusiness provides 
employment and food to 90% of Nigerian rural 
population and can provide the fiber needs of the 
nation [15] 
According to [2], performing agribusiness can serve  
as a social and economic inclusive strategy to 
enhance the livelihood of people living in poverty 
and youth empowerment. In other words, 
agribusiness can serve as a means of equitable 
distribution of social and economic amenities to th e 
Nigerian people. 
However, the benefits of agribusiness performance 
cannot be optimized if there is no proper modeling 
that can correctly predict the effects of 
macroeconomic variables on agribusiness 
performance or serve as a guide to formulate policy  
on agribusiness. This paper therefore creates a 
functional model of long run determinants of 
agribusiness performance.  
  Macro economic variables have determinant 
effects on every economic activity and that is the 
much reason it is necessary to understand the 
functional relationships with their dependent 
variable. On the other hand, untested and wrong 
model formulation will give a misleading result.  
 Literature abound in modeling functional 
relationship between macroeconomic determinants 
and the various components of agribusiness 
performance (agriculture production, agro-
manufacturing and other allied businesses) but not 
much is known about a holistic study of 
agribusiness as a sector especially in Nigeria give n 
the fact that it was in 2014 that policies were 
formulated to link agriculture production with agro -
allied manufacturing through the Agricultural 
Transformation Agenda (ATA) of the federal 
government of Nigeria [14]. However, the 
theoretical framework which forms part of the basis  
of agribusiness performance modeling is the theory 
of firm which measures performance in terms of 
increasing returns on input or maximization of its 
inputs which includes labor, capital and technology  
performance. Notwithstanding, the modeling of 
agribusiness performance and its determinants is 
expressed in the new endogenous growth theory 
which explicitly expresses economic growth as a 
dependent of capital, labor and technology. The 
underlying reason being that growth is a function o f 
performance measured as Real Gross Domestic 
Product (RGDP). [7]. Hence, agribusiness 
performance (RGDP of agribusiness) is expressed 
as a function of the affecting variables. Modeling 
that exhibits such relationship includes, modeling of 
the long run determinants of domestic private 
investment in Nigeria by Kazeem and Olukemi 
(2012); An application of ARDL Bounds Testing 
Procedure to the estimator of long run relationship  
between exchange rate, crude oil price and inflatio n 
in Nigeria by [16] and Diabate (2016) who applied 
ARDL bound testing to model Long run 
determinants of private domestic investment in Cote  
D’ivoire.  
3.0   METHODOLOGY 
3.1:  SOURCES OF DATA 
Data for this work are secondary time series source d 
from the data base of the Central Bank of Nigeria 
and World Development Indicators Data Base 2017 
of the World Bank from 1970 to 2017.

 3.2 Estimation Technique :  
The study adopts [18]  Auto-Regressive Distributive 
Lag (ARDL)/Bounds testing method to model the 
long run determinants of agribusiness performance. 
This method has advantages over [12], [13] 
Maximum likelihood and Engle and [6] co- 
integration methods. Unlike these other methods, 
Pesaran ARDL/Bounds test does not require 
pretesting of the variables to determine their orde r 
of integration and can be applied to a mixed unit 
root stationarity of I(0) and I(1) which none of th e 
former methods can apply. Other advantages 
include, modeling ARDL with appropriate lags 
solves the problem of serial correlation and 
endogenous problems [18]. According to [18] both 
the long run and short run are estimated simultaneously and also the bounds testing of small  
sample properties are superior to others. These 
properties make it most reliable for modeling 
functional relationship between agribusiness 
performance and its determinants   
 
3.3 Model Specification: 
In creating the model for functional relationship 
between agribusiness performance and the 
macroeconomic determinants, the work still 
maintains the theoretical background as discussed i n 
section two. The specification employs a linear 
functional relationship adopting modified model of 
[1] to model the functional relationship between 
agribusiness performance and its macroeconomic 
determinants as follows:   
 
AGB = f(RGDP, FIM, NOE,  FPI, CAP, INF,RER,LAB)…………… ………………..  …(1.1) .   
Rewriting the model in its explicit form as to dete rmine the effects of    
 
RGDP,FIM,NOE,FPI,CAP,INF,RER,LAB on agribusiness perf ormance equation (1.1) becomes:  
 
AGB=β 0+ β 1 GDP 1I,+ Β 2 FIM 2i + β 3 NOE 3i  + 
β4FPI 4 + B 5 CAP 5i +β 6 INF 6i  +β7RER7+ β8LAB8i + U i ………………………. (1.2) 
 
Where: 
Dependent variable= AGB = Agribusiness performance ( a proxy of aggregate Real 
Agriculture GDP, agro-manufacturing/processing GDP,  hotel and restaurants 
services GDP). 
 
Independent variables:-  
GDP = Real GDP (#b) 
FIM = Food import(#b)  
NOE = Non oil export (#b) 
FPI  = Foreign private investment (#b) 
CAP = Capital (#b) 
INF = Inflation(%) 
RER = Real exchange (%) 
LAB = Labor(%) 
 
Equation (1.2) predicts that agribusiness performan ce is positively affected by all the independent 
variables.  
 
Transforming equation (1.2) into the general condit ional ARDL modeling specification:  
∆AGB  =  β o  +  β 1  AGB t–1   +  β 2 RGDP  t–1  +  β 3 FIM  t–1  +  β 4 NOE  t–1  +  β 5  FPI  t–1  +  β 6  CAP  t–1  +  β 7 
INF  t–1  +  β 8 RER  t–1  +  β 9 LAB  t–1    +  2   ∆RGDP  t–1    +   3   ∆FIM  t–1    +  4 ∆NOE  t–
1   +  5 ∆FPI  t–1  +  6 ∆CAP  t–1  +  7 ∆INF t–1  +  8 ∆RER t–1  +  9 ∆LAB  t–
1  +  U i    . . ……………………   (1.3) 
 
Where:  
∆  =  first difference operator 
β1      β8  =   long run coefficients  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 178  
 α1  α8  =  short run coefficients 
βo   =  constant term 
 
3.3.1: Long run functional relationship 
In order to obtain long run functional relationship , parameters the following model is specified. 
AGB  =  β o  +   β1  AGB t–1 +    β 2 GDP  t–1  +  β3 FIM  t–1  +   β4 NOE  t–1  +  β5  FPI  t–1  + 
 β6  CAP  t–1  +  β7 INF  t–1  +  β8 RER  t–1  +  β9 LAB  t–1     +  U 2t    . . .   (1.4) 
Equation (1.4) forms the basis for empirical estima tion of the long run relationship between agribusin ess 
performance and the macroeconomic variables for thi s study.  The null hypothesis of no long run 
relationship among the variables in equation (1.4) is   stated as follows: 
H0 : β 1 = β2 = β3 = β4 = β5 = β6=…… =  β8= 0 
H1 : β1 ≠ β2 ≠ β3 ≠ β4 ≠ β5 ≠ β6 ≠….. ≠ β8    =   0 
In order to determine the long run relationship 
among the variables, ARDL Bound test is 
conducted on equation (1.3) through the following 
approach:  two sets of critical values were derived , 
based on the number of independent variables, in 
this case eight. The least of critical values 
represents lower bound while higher value 
represents upper bound. Lower critical bound is 
created based on the assumption that all variables 
are I(0) while the upper bound is on the assumption  
that all variables are I(1).  F-statistics is calcu lated 
and compared with the set of bounds.  If the 
calculated F-statistics exceeds the upper critical 
value, then null hypothesis of no co integration wi ll 
be rejected vice versa. If however it remains withi n 
the bounds, the test is inconclusive [19].  
 
Lag-Length selection 
In order to choose optimal lag length for each 
variable, the ARDL methodology estimated the 
number of regressions lag with the equation (m + 
1)k+1  Where: M=maximum number of lags  
K=number of variables in the equation 
 The orders of the lags of the ARDL models were 
selected using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), 
Schwarz, Hannan-Quinn criterions and final 
prediction error. 
 
3.3:  Model Diagnostic and stability test 
To ensure the goodness of fit of model, the 
diagnostic and stability or cumulative sum 
(CUSUM) test is conducted.  
The CUSUM test examines if the model is 
correctly specified and the parameter estimates are  
stable overtime. The CUSUM statistics is updated 
recursively and plotted against the break points. 
When the plots of CUSUM statistics stays within 
critical bounds of five percent level of significan ce, 
the null hypothesis of stable coefficients and corr ect 
model specification in the given regression is 
accepted. Otherwise, it will be rejected.  
 Jarque-Bera normality test is applied to test the 
serial normality

4.2 Results of Autoregressive Distributive Lag – 
Model (ARDL) / Bound Testing     (Effects of 
macroeconomic variables on agribusiness 
performance)  
After determining the order of integration, the 
research establishes the non-stationary variables b een 
co-integrated. However, even where individual time 
series were non-stationary, linear combination of 
them could be stationary because equilibrium forces  
tend to keep such series together in the long-run [ 6]. 
The presence of co-integration however implies that  a 
stationary long-run relationship is present in the 
series. [18] Bound test approach of testing for co integration is utilized. As shown in table 4.3, the  joint 
null hypothesis of lagged level variables coefficie nt 
being zero or not integrated is rejected at 10%, 5%  
and 1% levels of significance. This is based on the  
fact that the calculated F-statistics value of 10.9 4127, 
exceeds the upper bound critical value of 3.15 at 
95%, 2.85 at 90%, 2.62 at 99% levels. This suggests  
that the null hypothesis of no co-integration betwe en 
agribusiness performance and the determinants is 
rejected at 10%, 5% and 1% levels of significance 
and therefore, there exists a long-run co-integrati ng 
relationship between agribusiness performance and 
the affecting macroeconomic variables

The regression results shows goodness of fit (Adj. 
R2 = 90.79%). The overall model is highly 
significant (F-statistics = 23.3281, at P-value = 
0000). The DW statistics at 2.5 does not impose any  
serious correlation problem since ARDL method 
was applied to correct the correlation problem 
(Tang, 2006). The CUSUM graph, as interpreted in 
fig. 4 indicates correct model specification and 
parameter stability, since the critical bounds of 5 % 
level of significance was fulfilled. All the variab les 
indicate an a priori  expectations but for food import 
that shows positive relationship, though not 
significant. The results shows that within the 
medium term of operation, the non oil export and 
capital are capable of enhancing agribusiness performanceNotwithstanding, for non oil export to 
positively affect agribusiness performance at the 
long run, it has to diversify from the export of ra w 
material to processed and finished products. More 
investment is required in technology and modern 
capital equipment to expand or optimize 
performance. Labor shows infinitesimal positive 
though significant relationship. This suggests exce ss 
and under developed labor that requires human 
capital development 
The lagged value of agribusiness as a regress and, 
improves the result of long-run co-integration sinc e 
a unit change in its value results into 48% change in 
agribusiness performance. It also shows a direct 
relationship between previous and present period

unemployed youths in the country has caused much ha rm and destruction, if nothing is done, our 
country may sink into oblivion. This is as a result  of lack of job opportunities. The study aimed at 
lending a support for urgent need for the nation’s huge investment in Information Technology 
Infrastructure. The system  will play a key role an d serve as a vision of the future in the creation o f job 
opportunities for the unemployed youths and also th is will achieve the goal of galvanizing a new world  
order for job opportunities and national developmen t. The interest in this area of study was motivated  
by the desires for the nation to invest in Informat ion Technology (IT), the most promising technology 
and cultural, advance world has seen in a long time . The method adopted was oral interview, 
investigation observation and it is manual   . The result of this study will help to proactively addre ss 
potential unemployment saga and risk that has eaten  into the fabrics of our country. This will achieve  
the goal, “IT as a creative enabler for job opportunit ies. 
Keywords:  Vision of the future, job opportunities IT as a cr eative enabler, unemployment, galvanize, 
huge investment, risk and vices. 
1. Introduction 
The youth of today are more fortunate than their 
counterparts of the 19th and 20th centuries. The 
tool that makes them luckier is information 
technology (IT). 
They can today stay in their rooms or cyber cafes 
to browse the complex network of computers 
around the world and get whatever information 
they desire. They can do million dollar businesses 
without having to leave Nigeria shores. 
 
However, they are a little more unfortunate than 
their predecessors because the world has changed 
negatively against them. 
 
There is today more unemployment globally 
among the youths than ever before. 
 
This unemployment problem is however 
structural, youth are getting more involved in evil -
robbery, 419, drug pushing, murder, rape, 
drunkenness and unmentionable other vices which 
have today separated us from those of our fore 
fathers. 
 The reasons for the geometric ascension of vices 
can be further rooted to the inability of most 
governments to effectively take care of their 
citizens and the unacceptable unemployment 
levels prevalent in the world today. Particularly i n 
developing nations like Nigeria. 
 
Other problems include meaningless currency 
strangulated by international politics and weak 
productive economy and inability of most 
developing governments to stimulate industrial 
production and to expand employment. 
 
Therefore we are proposing a vision for the future 
that information technology, if properly 
harnessed, can change the fortune of the youths 
positively in the 21st century. 
2. Problem Definition 
 
The stemming frog-leaping over inconsistencies, 
contradictions and risk associated with 
unemployment and unrestrained frustration of our 
unemployed youths who may have the burning  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 182  
 desires to actualize their long cherished dream is 
alarming. 
 
Infact, the number of the risk is legion. Therefore , 
there is need for a vision for the future and job 
opportunities-IT as a creative enabler. 
 
3. Objectives of Study 
(i) To establish linkages between innovation 
technology and job creation in an 
economy through IT. 
(ii) To tap from IT which is a great economic 
enabler and job creation 
(iii) To suggest means of creating vibrant  IT 
driven economy to create jobs for the 
teaming unemployed youths 
(iv) To propose a vision for the future that 
information technology, if properly 
harnessed, can change the fortune of the 
youths positively in the 21st century. 
 
4. Literature Review 
M’bow-former UNESCO scribe - said some forty 
years ago: “Information Technology has opened 
up such tremendous vista for modern societies that 
any failure to master it would mean a life of 
permanent subordination. For Information 
Technology is more than a form of power. It is a 
power system. The technology which it involves is 
not just one form of technology among others but 
an ability to make use of other techniques to give 
or refuse access to a whole range of scientific dat a 
and knowledge and thus to design new models of 
development” [1] 
In reference, to the above assertion, our nation 
cannot afford to be oh yes members in a world that 
is completely driven by IT, and for our country to 
be relevant, there is need for a vision of the futu re 
for the development of IT culture.According to [2] 
recently posited that today technology is a key 
factor for economic, social and technological 
progress, and for the sustainability of economics, 
all over the world. 
This statement is further buttressed by an IDC 
study in 2007 which quoted global spending on 
information technology to possess the capacity to 
create 7.1 million new jobs and 100,000 new 
businesses over the next four years. The IDC 
research predicted that in 2007. Microsoft- related  
activities would be responsibler 14.7 million jobs 
from an IT industry, total of 35.2 million people which was 42% of total IT employment globally 
in 2007 and more than $514 billion in tax revenue 
worldwide. [3] had quantified the enormous power 
of software to create local jobs and grow 
economies around the world, in both developed 
and developing markets, according to [3], 
information technology has already helped 
empower more than a billion people but there are 
another 5 billion we have yet to reach. This 
information tells us that we as a society need to d o 
more work. Most Nigerians in the remote 
communities are not connected to the product of 
IT – (Internet) and therefore cannot explore the e-
commerce potential and world trade e-commerce 
today remain the hub of wealth of nations. The 
IDC research which was sponsored by Microsoft 
applied IDC‘s economic impact model, which 
assesses the IT industry’s impact on job creation, 
company formation, Local IT spending and tax 
revenues  in addition to assessing Microsoft’s 
partner ecosystem. It examined the IT industry’s 
impact on local job creation, company formation 
and tax revenues in 82 countries representing 99.5 
percent of the total technology spending 
worldwide. 
IDC found that the Microsoft ecosystem-defined 
as people working at IT companies and IT 
professionals who create, sell or distribute 
products that run on Microsoft platforms plays a 
key role in driving the IT industry’s over all 
contributions to job growth and economic 
development. 
In line with thinking [4] stated that information 
technology is the most powerful thing that has 
happened to mankind in our civilization. It is a 
new opportunity to change the world in a very 
different way. He re-emphasized that changing 
global awareness on IT usefulness creates a 
chance for growth of job opportunities and also 
bring information technology to the poorest 
people. So the potential energy and creativity that  
each one of them can be unleashed. 
According to [5] there is need to establish 
linkages between innovation technology and job 
creation in an economy, via IT, and there is need 
to tap from this technology which is a great 
economic enabler and job creator. The issue now 
is how can we create a vibrant IT driven economy 
to create jobs for the teaming unemployed youths? 
 
5. Significance of Study   
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 183  
 There is need for a vision for the future and job 
opportunities to which IT is a creative enabler, 
hence, this leads to actual process to fine tune th e 
future growth trajectory of IT for human 
development and job opportunities. This can also 
lead to actual setup of a functional IT and at the 
same time peep into the future implementation of 
IT skills for job opportunities. This will serve as  
gateway project for the future job opportunities IT  
as a creative enabler. 
 
6. Methods and Materials  
In this study, due to the nature of this work, the 
study deploys oral interview, investigation, 
observation and it is manual. Information collected  
daily is written on paper and stored in files for 
references. 
 
7. Discussion  
A Vision of the Future and Job Opportunities: 
The vision of the future is that through 
Information Technology (IT), as a creative 
enabler, highly skilled global manpower should be 
produced who shall be catalysts for Technological 
and socio-economic advancement of themselves 
(self employed) and the society. 
 
Through Information Technology (IT), the 
required workforce needed to drive the Nigeria 
economy by tapping the vast potentials of the 
nation should be produced. IT as a creative 
enabler, should be able to instill in all our 
graduates the necessary skills, competencies and 
inspiration to be successful real human being. IT 
should help to create a sustainable employment 
base. There is need to get involved in mass 
manpower development in IT particularly skills 
that the industry demands. A large number of 
graduated students of other fields can be retrained  
to the level of IT industry certification and these  
people can be exported to the oil and gas industry 
as well as to overseas, where there is acute need 
for highly skilled IT manpower. There is also the 
need for one to become a functional member of 
our new information society, everybody require 
practical IT training. 
Infact Information Technology (IT) as a creative 
enabler for the future, should drive long term 
trajectory and economic growth, productivity and 
improved standards of living, while creating jobs 
which are often in different industries and required different skills. Is it not possible for 
government to organize the industry leaders and 
stakeholders to mobilize funds to train our 
teaming unemployed graduates in the hi-tech 
fields of micro-Litography, VLSI (Very Large 
Scale Integration), Nanotechnology, software 
engineering, Networking and Broadband  
technology for IT diffusion. 
Good IT skills will eliminate unemployment, 
kidnapping, armed robbery, other risks, and vices, 
IT should create an enabling environment for 
economic progress. There is need to establish a 
bridge with the government on how we can go to 
the next mile creating jobs through Information 
technology (IT) diffusion. 
 
8. Conclusion  
We should begin to put plans on paper for the 
realization of some of those projects proposed 
above. In other words, let us wake up and make 
meaningful contributionsfor the development of 
our nation through acquiring IT skills and to 
create accelerated diffusion of IT development 
and application. This portends good for the people 
and the generations unborn. 
It should not end here as a talk shop, but discuss 
issues such as community radio and terrestrial 
community telephone using VOP and emerging 
broadband technology, we can mobilize our 
people at home and aboard to support our effort in 
making the IT hub of Nigeria we can see that with 
a good training foundation, we can achieve a lot 
as a nation for job opportunities and for national 
development.  
 
9. Recommendation  
The most dynamic tool to develop the youths of 
this century is Information Technology training. 
The world should vote more budget to train the 
youths to acquire IT skills in all the technical 
fields such as software engineering, computer 
Hardware Engineering, Internet Class Room 
technology or e-learning, e-commerce and 
website development, Network Technologies and 
associate software development, parallel 
processing Technologies, micro-Lithography and 
VLSI technologies, Nano-technology, Artificial 
intelligence and Expert systems, virtual Reality 
and 3-D animation technologies. 
Youths should Endeavour to pursue serious IT 
skills in the related areas above. There are  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 184  
 currently over one million vacancies in the 
European Union and the America’s for youths 
who have acquires IT skills in programming in 
JAVA, C++, Corba, Oracle and Visual Basic and 
these countries are willing to import any skilled 
youth from any country of the world, be it black 
or white. The demand gap could be expanded 
considerably in future if the developing countries 
grapple to join the information society. Most of 
the countries like Nigeria should be working very 
hard to eliminate IT infrastructural hiccups for 
effective and smooth landing into an information 
society. 
In others, almost all the universities and tertiary  
institutions in Nigeria and indeed globally are 
lacking high caliber personnel in Information 
technology. Acquisition of IT skills will galvanize  
the youths for greater productivity, job mobility 
around the world and the possibility of increasing the wealth of Nigeria through human resources 
export.   
IT productive and skilled youths will lead to a 
better world devoid of poverty, crime and other 
vices as currently prevailing. Nations around the 
world should no longer pay lip service to IT 
human development. 
Adequate budget should be provided for the 
development of IT resources in primary, 
secondary, and tertiary institutions to enhance 
youth development. Infact, the impact of 
Information Technology Training is tremendous 
on the socio-economic development of nations. It 
is expected that information technology will 
constitute a vital tool for socio-economic 
development and job creation, poverty alleviation 
and elimination of technological backwardness of 
the African continent

Abstract 
 
University Administration is a complex system,which  saddles the management of these institutions with 
a lot of responsibilities. The objective of this pr oject is to develop an integrated portal system for  
university administration that will provide feature s form online, fee payment, staff appraisal system,  
online course allocation system, e-mail-based resul t alert system, automatic transfer of students data  to 
course lecturer’s profile and online transcript gen eration. Upon investigation it was discovered that 
there is an existing system on ground. Performance evaluation of the Imo state university system 
revealed many loopholes including omission of stude nt’s names in the examination and results manifest,  
manual course allocation system. In order to arrest  the above listed misnomer, this study was motivate d 
to develop a new and comprehensive system that has all the above listed functionalities in an enhanced  
manner with additional features that are not in the  existing system. Object-Oriented Software 
Development adopted in developing this system while  PHP, AJAX, JavaScript and MYSQL web 
programming languages were used in the implementati on of the system. The result of this study is indeed 
an enhanced integrated portal system that the unive rsity administrators can employ in order to 
effectively monitor the activities of the students a nd staff of the university . 
 
Introduction 
Over the years, web portal system has become 
popular in the information system community. 
This is because it aggregates information from 
multiple sources and then makes that information 
available for various uses. A web portal provides 
gateway not just to sites on the web but also to al l 
network accessible resources.   
Although there are several definitions for web 
portal from various authors, but there is a 
common ground to their descriptions, which is 
that; a web portal is a single, personalized 
interface through which users can access virtually 
all information resources in a secure, consistent 
and customizable manner. It can also be referred 
to as a personalized collection of and usage of 
information, contents and services.  
It is very interesting to note that personalization 
and customization are keys to successful 
knowledge management because they provide 
access to targeted information based on 
vvcwXZMFGindividual roles and responsibilities 
within the institution. The collection of disparate  
contents into a well-structured personal portal is 
also an important element of success in the design 
and implementation of a web portal. A web portal 
therefore, must provide more than simple access to data or web resources. It should constitute the 
search bar, navigation bar and all other 
communication tools necessary for members of 
the institution to do their work in a collaborative  
manner.  
Moreover, an Academic Web Portal System, 
which is a subset of Web Portal System has these 
days become of much interest in our higher 
institutions. Academic web portal system, for 
instance, integrate campus-specific information 
and activities which are stored in the campus 
electronic vaults such as databases, file systems 
and existing application systems, with 
unstructured data/information from on-and-off 
campus. The Web portals connect users not only 
with everything they need to know but with 
everyone they need to get across to, (Gleason, 
2000).  
In the same vein, Moore (2001) further pointed 
out that one of the importance of integrating 
applications, rather than engaging in simple 
collection of contents within the portal is because  
a single portal will never provide users with all 
their information needs. A given organization can 
create a gateway that would be providing them 
with a significant amount of core information.   
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 187  
 Borck (2001) also concurred with Moore's view 
on emerging importance of content 
personalization for personalized web portal 
applications, based on factors such as user's 
current task, time of the day, accessing device, 
bandwidth, and user's location.  
The web portal technology is also used as a tool to 
enhance institutional efficiency and productivity. 
It enables university information system users to 
communicate with the university information sub-
systems securely. Communication community in 
an academic portal environment involves 
teachers, students and supporting administrative 
staff. The portal can provide its users with easier  
access to information as well as with information 
that is more relevant to them. This is because 
inadequate or delayed communication within the 
system can hamper progress and slow down the 
institutional functionality. Academic web portal 
system, however, makes the academic 
environment easier for staff and students to access  
important information from anywhere and at any 
point in time.  
Moreover, Ryland (2002) described web portal as 
a "killer" application of knowledge management 
due to its versatility, broad technical and 
functional capabilities, and ease of use. A well-
designed portal allows institutions to create and 
implement any knowledge management strategy 
of their choice.  
Furthermore, a web portal consists of several 
hardware and software components that perform 
the functions of servicing the user's requests and 
assembling the necessary information for delivery 
through a Web browser. Many of these 
components share the same server, whether they 
consist of computer software or hardware. The 
software component can reside in either device on 
separate hardware servers or be collocated on a 
single device. The hardware architecture decision 
is usually determined based on the projected 
demands on the Web site. A well-designed 
Website should be able to accommodate update 
and provide for flexibility in hardware 
configuration as the needs of the organization 
change. A term generally referred to as being 
scalable.  
Moreover, whenever payment system is 
mentioned in portal development, there are certain 
terms that readily come to mind. These terms are payment service provider, payment processor, 
payment gateway, payment service and merchant 
account. The payment service provider is the 
same as payment gateway. It is the company 
(companies) that are responsible for making 
online payment service available to subscribers. 
Just like mobile service network providers in the 
likes of MTN, GLO, Etisalat, etc. while payment 
processor is the application or system that 
validates client's credit card details whenever the y 
make transactions online. This system helps to 
verify if the credit card in question meet every 
requirements to transact business online. Also, 
merchant account is a special kind of bank 
account that is used to hold funds received from 
online transactions, from where the fund is 
transferred to the beneficiary's account.  
Finally, Chan et al (2002) stated that web portals 
development is a very costly initiative and not 
only that it costs companies fortunes to develop 
but also requires significant business process in 
order to influence business benefits.  
 
Motivation 
Upon investigation,it was discovered that there is 
an existing system on ground performance 
evaluation of the Imo state university system 
revealed many loopholes including semi- 
automated fee payment system, consistent 
omission of student names in the examination and 
results manifest, manual course allocation system. 
In order to arrest the above listed misnomer,this 
study developed a new and comprehensive system 
that has all the above listed functionalities in an  
enhanced manner with additional features that are 
not in the existing system. 
 
1.1 Statement Of The Problem  
The aim of office automation is to cut down on 
the processes involved in performing some office 
functions in order to enhance productivity and 
comfortability for both the management and other 
users of the system. But it becomes an aberration 
once the system which is automated to make life 
easy for the users now elongates the processes it 
was meant to shorten. After critical study of the 
existing systems being deployed in Imo State 
University (IMSU) Owerri, we observed some 
lapses in the system. Accordingly, the lapses are 
enumerated below:   
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 188  
 Constant omissions of Students names in the 
examination attendance manifest and results 
templates after successful registration of their 
courses are quite alarming. This is as a result of 
manual posting of students profile to the 
respective course lecturers by the system admin. 
This factor not only affects the studets but also th e 
lecturers which invariably do not know the 
number of students registered of such course.  
i.The course allocations system is manual. Each 
semester when course allocations are printed by 
the result database unit, lecturers usually find th eir 
names against the courses they were allocated to 
teach when the system was initially hosted.  
ii.The existing systems do not provide for staff 
records management such as staff employment 
information.  
iii.The existing system did not provide for online 
student transcript processing  
iv.At times after a course lecturer might have 
published his result on a course, some students 
data are pushed to his profile from nowhere for 
him to publish result for them the pertinent 
question now is “when did those students register 
those courses” 
v. Application for excess credit unit is 
handled by the administration manually. 
 
Aim/Objectives of The Study  
The aim of this project is to develop An 
Integrated Portal System for University 
Administration. The specific objectives are to 
develop modules that will:-  
i. Provide for online school fee payments using 
theircredit cards. 
ii. Enable students to check and print their results 
online using scratch cards. 
iii. Provides access-level-based results uploading 
(lecturers’ access level, HODs access level and 
Dean’s access level). 
iv. Send students results to them via Email and 
SMS alerts once the Dean of the Faculty 
approves their result. 
v. Manage students transcript processing and 
online clearance. 
1.4 Significance of Study 
As a result of the bottlenecks found in the existin g 
systems, which include: provision of one-way result  
upload by lecturers, on-inclusion of online course 
allocations, limited platforms for mobile payments, lack of portal contents updates too 
many empty webpages and broken links, 
information impairments, non-inclusion of staff 
records management feature etc. This research is 
poised to enhancing the existing systems by 
combing the functionalities of these two systems 
into one in order to address all the above listed 
issues. 
i. Platforms provided by the existing 
systems. This proposed system will bridge this 
gap by providing a payment database to keep 
records of every student that paid their fees, such  
as the bank where the payment was made, the 
amount paid, the payment platform used, the date 
and time payment was made. 
ii. It will help the student to reduce the 
amount of money they spend patronizing the 
business center for their course registration, resu lt 
checking and other auxiliary online transaction as 
a result of unfriendly platform provided in the 
existing systems. Including the amount of stress 
they usually incur while shuttling themselves 
between ICT Research Centers, CAS; RESULT 
database unit and register’s office, university 
main campus over trivial issues that can be 
resolved online. 
iii. The system will help to cut down the cost 
of maintenance of the website by the management 
of Imo State University and help them to use the 
money to embark on other projects. This is 
because the system will be managed by the staff 
of the university, which does not require extra 
maintenance cost from the university. 
iv. The proposed system will provide 
enriching content that will positively project the 
image of this institution to the world. As 
information update will be rapid and provision of 
online solution to complaints will be as quick as 
possible because there will always be a standby 
admin to attend to student and staff complaint. 
v. The system will help minimize the rate of 
omission of students’ data in examination 
attendance and result manifests. 
2.0 Literature Review 
2.1 Concept Of Academic Portal System  
An Academic Portal system is relatively a new 
technology that has arrived on the scene in 
institutions of tertiary education across the globe . 
The concept is based on emerging Web 
technology and its implications in the activities o f  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 189  
 various stakeholders in these institutions. The 
Academic Portal concept cuts across many 
disciplines, which include but not limited to, Web 
technology, Human-Computer Interaction, 
technology adoption, management, and so forth. 
In this current global economy, education has 
become a major service industry, such that the 
need for competitive edge has become a strategic 
part of many educational institutions. It can 
perform vital roles in facilitating the business 
processes of all the stakeholders within and 
outside an institution, thereby enabling the 
achievement of organization's goals without much 
delay.  
However, the mere implementation of any 
Academic Portal cannot guarantee that the 
institution will achieve its goals and retain a 
business competitive advantage over its 
competitors. Moreover, misunderstanding of the 
scope of academic portal will invariably lead to 
disaster. The concept of Portal system has evolved 
rapidly over the last few years and involves 
diverse technological, human and organizational 
aspects; has brought some confusion over its 
terminology, concepts, and other related issues 
that need to be clarified. This is because the 
ignorance and misunderstanding of these issues 
has become a barrier to cooperation between the 
management, the development team and the 
various users within some of these institutions.  
However, the concept of Academic Portal System 
is a derivative of the more general notion of an 
Enterprise Portal, which had been adopted in 
many business organizations. While few academic 
researchers are available in these areas, most 
original literatures are in the form of practitione r 
reports published by business organizations and 
technical portal vendors (Nordheim et al, 2004)  
It is our aim therefore to begin this chapter with 
the concept of academic portal in overall. We will 
then proceed to describe issues of both Enterprise 
Portal and Academic Portal systems from both the 
practitioner and academic points of view, 
identifying and clarifying the major important 
issues of relevance to Academic Portal 
Development (APD).  
 
 
3.0 Methodology  
According to Hornby (2009), methodology is defined as a set of methods and principles used to 
perform a particular activity. Software 
methodology is the body of methods, rules, 
postulates, procedures and processes that are used 
to manage a software engineering project 
(Osuagwu, 2008). System analysis is defined as 
the detailed study of an existing system with a 
view to understanding how it function and 
possibly suggesting or proffering solutions to the 
problems discovered. The ective of research 
methodology is to take a realistic insight into a 
system and its problem areas so that an improved 
system can be designed or developed. For the 
analyst to be able to achieve his aim, he must 
come up with a realistic and well-articulated 
guidelines and procedures. However, the concept 
of methodology entails the physical 
implementation of the logical cycle that 
incorporates the following activities:  
1.The step-by-step processes/activities for each 
resolved  
2.The individual functions to be performed in 
various activities  
3.Deliverable standard for each activity involved 
in the process  
4.Tools /techniques to apply for each activity  
There exist several software development 
methodologies for which a system like this system 
under study can be based upon. Some of the 
methodologies include:  
 
1. Object-Oriented Software Development:   It 
is a popular technical approach for analysing and 
designing an application and system by applying 
object-oriented programming technique, as well 
as using visual modelling throughout the 
development life / cycles in order to foster a bette r 
stakeholder communication and product quality.  
According to Unified Process; OOAD in modern 
software engineering is best conducted in an 
iterative and incremental way. Iteration by 
iteration, the outputs of OOAD activities, analysis  
models for OOA and design models for 000 
respectively, will be refined and evolve 
continuously driven by key factors like risks and 
business value.  
Moreover, the Object-Oriented Software 
Development Method (OOSD) includes object-
oriented requirements analysis, as well as object-
oriented design. It focuses on objects early in the   
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 190  
 development, with attention to generating a useful 
model and a picture of the system that is 
modifiable, reusable, reliable, and understandable.  
The last is perhaps the most important because the 
picture of a software system created by a 
development method must be an effective device 
for communication among developers, customers, 
management, and quality-assurance personnel.  
 
2. Agile development:  This group of software 
development methodologies is based on iterative 
development, where requirements and solutions 
evolve via collaborations between self-organizing 
and cross-functional teams. It fundamentally 
incorporates iteration and the continuous feedback 
that it provides to successively refine and deliver  
a software system.  
3. Waterfall development:   It is a sequential 
development approach, in which development is 
seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a 
waterfall) through several phases, typically: 
requirements analysis, software design, 
implementation, testing, integration (if there are 
multiple subsystems), deployment (or installation) 
and maintenance.  
4. Spiral development:  This combines some key 
aspect of the waterfall model and rapid 
prototyping methodologies, in an effort to 
combine advantages of top-down and bottom-up 
concepts. It provides emphasis in a key area many 
felt had been neglected by other methodologies: 
deliberate iterative risk analysis, particularly 
suited to large-scale complex systems.  
5. Rapid application development:  This is a 
software development methodology, which 
favors’ iterative development and the rapid 
construction of prototypes instead of large 
amounts of up-front planning. The planning of 
software developed using RAD is interleaved with 
writing the software itself. The lack of extensive 
pre-planning generally allows software to be 
written much faster, and makes it easier to change 
requirements  
 
3.1 Choice of Methodology  
Having understood the importance of software 
development methodologies in software 
development, the researcher had to embark on 
critical review of the different software designs 
and development methodologies in order to come up with the ones that can help get the project 
completed on time.  However, the researcher 
settled for Object-Oriented Software 
Development Approach. This is because it views 
a system as a collection of self-contained objects,  
including both data and processes. As against 
traditional systems analysis and design 
methodologies that are either data-centric or 
process-centric.  
In addition, due to the increase in processor power 
and decrease in processor cost, object-oriented 
approach became feasible. These objects can be 
built as individual pieces and then put together to  
form a whole system. Another beauty of object is 
that they can be reused over and over in several 
systems and changed without affecting other 
system components.  
However, object-oriented systems focus on 
capturing the structure and behaviour of 
information systems in little module that 
encompass both data and processes. These little 
modules are known as objects.  
However, one may be constrained to ask how 
object-oriented approach differs from other 
traditional methodologies such as waterfall 
development, parallel development, iterative 
development, etc. Technically speaking, the 
concept of polymorphism, encapsulation and 
inheritance taken together allows analysts to break 
a complex system into smaller, more manageable 
components to work on individually and to move 
easily from piece to piece. This modularity makes 
system development easier to grasp easier to share 
among members of a project team and easier to 
communicate to users who are needed throughout 
the SDLe to provide requirements and confirm 
how well the system meets the requirements.  
By modularizing system development, the project 
team is actually creating reusable pieces that can 
be plugged into other systems efforts, or used as 
starting points for other projects. Ultimately, thi s 
can save time because new project do not have to 
start from scratch and learning curves are not as 
steep. Moreover, it allows higher level of 
abstraction, provides. 
 
3.2 Conclusion 
This project, an Integrated Portal System for 
University Administration will be developed to 
overcome the flaws observed in the existing  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 191  
 systems. Having discovered from the literature 
review that the two major components that arc 
used to rate/grade the operational efficacy of any 
web portal system is personalization and 
customization. These features were religiously 
followed in the development of the system so that 
every user of the system, irrespective of their 
level of involvement in the IT field will be able t o 
use the system to perform any operation without 
much difficulty.  
However, in chapter one of this project, some 
objectives "are outlined as the blueprint which 
this research work intends to achieve. It is on thi s 
premise therefore that I wish to conclude thus:  
i. That a module which will allow students to 
electronically pay school fees using their 
credit cards online via remittal platform was 
developed and it is fully functional. 
ii. That the researcher was able to create 
a module in the system which can allow 
students register their courses online and print 
their acknowledgement slip. 
iii. That modules which allow students 
check and print their sessional results using 
scratch cards was developed. 
iv. That an access-level-based results 
uploading (lecturers access level, HODs 
access level and deans access level) was 
developed and it is fully functional  
v. That an SMS and e-mail-based results alert 
system were developed, such that when the 
dean of a faculty approves students results, the 
students will access their resultsvia their email 
vi.That an electronic/automated course allocation 
system was developed. 
vii. That a module which will allow lecturers 
see/view the courses that has been allocatedto 
them in a particular semester was developed iii.That module which will enable lecturers see the  
number of students who registered for their 
courses and also download those students’ 
profiles for examination attendance and result 
publication was created. 
iii. That a module which allows failed courses to 
pop-up first before the current semestercourses. 
iv. That a module which will handle transcript 
processing was created and it is fully functional.  
Moreover, as a tool/guide to help users achieve 
the above, a lot of visual clues were introduced in  
the design of the interface coupled with 
descriptive error message outputs used in the 
validations of all the form fields.  
Also, in order to eliminate error inputs from users , 
user inputs were strongly minimized by the 
provision of selection/list menu input fields, more  
especially where a uniform data entry is required 
from all the users. This feature will help a great 
deal in database querying.  
For maximum security of data and speed of the 
system, we employed two-tier architecture. This 
feature helps for load balancing and speedy data 
access.  
Furthermore, the implementation of remittal 
payment platform is a very great achievement 
such that students can comfortably pay their 
school fees anywhere without flexing a muscle in 
the queue at the banks. The staff as well can 
comfortably fill out and monitor their annual 
appraisal exercise online.  
Finally, Itherefore wish to conclude by saying that 
this system is a compendium of all you can think 
of in terms of a portal that the university 
administrators can employ in order to effectively 
monitor the activities of the students and staff of  
the university.

Abstract 
In our day to day life, increase in the number of v ehicles like motorcycle, car, bus, van and truck et c. is 
very rapid. As a result of traffic blocking and eno rmous problems in metro cities. Due to traffic jamm  
problem, some large issues are found such as pollut ion, wastage of time, and accidents. Traffic jamm 
arises terribly often time which in the contemporar y world that has an effect on the means of life and  
introduces a large amount of issues and challenges.  To resolve this problem, using traffic signal timi ng 
optimization is the better solution. This research work proposes a fuzzy logic controller for multiple  
intersection model. The issues in traffic trade are  mostly characterized by the uncertain and unsure 
parameters. A fuzzy logic traffic control simulatio n model is developed and tested using MATLAB 
software. The Performance of fuzzy logic based on t raffic signal timing optimization compared with 
fixed time controller using the research field. The  performance of Fuzzy Logic Controller is found to be 
similar to that of the fixed controller in normal t raffic conditions. However, in heavy traffic condit ions, 
Fuzzy Logic Controller results shows 30% decrease o n average delay of cars waiting at the intersection  
and 10% improvement on total number of cars served at the intersection over the same simulation 
period compared to the fixed time controller. The re sults show that there is a huge improvement that can  
be realized by using Fuzzy Logic Controller in contro lling traffic flow at multiple intersections.

1.1 Introduction 
Traffic problem is one of the major problems in 
many metropolitan cities around the world. This 
traffic problem can affect the economy, slow down 
the development, and reduce the production, 
pollution, wastage of time, fuel, and accidents. Th ere 
are several causes that can create traffic problem in a 
big city. Among them increasing number of vehicles,  
shortage of sufficient roads and highways, and 
traditional traffic light system. All of these fact ors 
can create traffic congestion in the intersection b ut 
among them traditional traffic light system is one of 
the major factors. Traffic signals are common 
features of urban areas throughout the world, 
controlling number of vehicles. Their main goals ar e 
improving the traffic safety at the intersection, 
maximizing the capacity at the intersection and 
minimizing the delays. Fuzzy logic controller allow s 
linguistic and inexact traffic data to be manipulat ed 
in controlling the traffic signal timings. A fuzzy 
control system is a rule-based control system which  
is characterized by expressing control rules of an 
expert using a fuzzy theory and determining a 
control command by a fuzzy inference. A fuzzy logic controller describes a control protocol by means of  if 
- then rules. In 1965 Zadeh planned the conception 
of fuzzy logic that’s terms for fuzzy sets .It is t he 
best solution which deals with real time problem by  
developing the precise conclusions the most and 
basic components of fuzzy set theory are knowledge 
domain within which the operating of fuzzy system 
is keep within the type of if-then rules, inputs in  
crisp manner, outputs that are in crisp manner 
associated an abstract thought system that compares  
with input variables and the information keep 
primarily based at that time the output is decided.  
The basic of fuzzy logic traffic controller is to m odel 
control strategy based on human expert knowledge. 
In a conventional traffic light controller, the tra ffic 
lights change at constant cycle time which is clear ly 
not the optimal solution. It would be more feasible  
and sensible to pass more cars at the green interva l if 
there are fewer cars waiting behind the red lights or 
vice versa. The fuzzy logic theory is introduced in  
the traffic controller to provide an intelligent gr een 
interval response based on traffic load inputs. A 
fuzzy logic control scheme is proposed to overcome  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 194  
 the inefficiency of traffic controller. In this pap er we 
proposed a new fuzzy logic controller system that 
can effectively handle the bad traffic situation wh en 
there are congestion and long queue of vehicle 
waiting at red light. It can manage green phase 
lengths adaptively according to the traffic load an d 
waiting queue. By controlling the green phase 
duration it can effectively reduce the vehicle wait ing 
time at red light. To give a graphical view of the 
proposed system we developed a simulation by using 
MATLAB, which explains all the membership 
functions and fuzzy inference rules used for the 
system. 
 
1.2 Problem Definition 
In the recent increase in number of vehicles on 
the road and inability of the government to create 
new roads has led to traffic congestion problem in 
many cities. This traffic problem usually affect th e 
economy, slow down the development, and reduce 
the production, air pollution, wastage of time, fue l, 
and accidents. One major factor of this congestion is 
the traffic light system that controls the traffic light 
at intersections. Most of the regular traffic syste m 
does not consider variance in traffic light time 
duration and cannot optimize the performance. The 
proposed fuzzy logic traffic controller system can 
provides better solution of traffic congestion. 
Instated of fixed time duration it considers differ ent 
time length for the green light time duration 
depending on the current traffic density of the 
intersection. By optimizing the green light time 
duration our system can handle the congestion bette r 
than other regular systems. 
 
1.3 Objectives and scope of the paper 
The detailed objectives of this work are: 
1) To present fuzzy logic controller as a 
control method in traffic signal control. 
2) To optimize the traffic signals timings for 
multiple intersection. 
3) To derive and introduce a general rule 
base for traffic signals timings optimization for 
multiple intersection in different cases. 
4) To test the efficiency of fuzzy signal 
control using simulation. 
 
1.4 Proposed Method  
Developing an intelligent traffic signal control 
system can help to solve the traffic congestion problem in many cities. Most of the regular traffic  
light control systems are based on the fixed time 
duration of the green phase, which can change the 
traffic signals at constant cycle time. This type t o 
traffic control system cannot extend the current 
green light time duration based on the current traf fic 
situation and cannot reduce the vehicle’s waiting 
time at the red light. A traffic light controller b ased 
on fuzzy logic can be used for optimum control of 
traffic volumes such as over saturated or unusual 
load conditions. This research work talks about the  
implementation of fuzzy logic controller system tha t 
can be used to control a traffic signal control at 
multiple intersection model. The proposed fuzzy 
traffic light controller, introduced in this resear ch, 
will be able to manage the congestion better than 
fixed time duration based traffic control system. T his 
fuzzy traffic control system can minimize the vehic le 
waiting time at red light. It can extend a current 
green phase by adding different time duration by 
applying some fuzzy rules. 
 
1.5 Multiple Intersection Model.  
The traffic signal controllers for multiple 
intersection model as shown in Figure 1 are designe d 
based on the traffic model from Che Soh et al. The 
multiple traffic intersection model developed in 
MATLAB using Image Processing Toolbox and 
Fuzzy Logic toolbox. 
 
1.6 Design Of Fuzzy Logic Traffic Controller  
The Fuzzy Logic Toolbox in Matlab which has a 
graphical user interface (GUI) to efficiently desig n 
and implement fuzzy control system. Although it’s 
possible to use the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox by working 
strictly from the command line, in general it’s muc h 
easier to build a system graphically reported in. 
There are five primary GUI tools for building, 
editing, and observing fuzzy inference systems in t he 
Fuzzy Logic Toolbox are Fuzzy Inference System or 
FIS Editor, the Membership Function Editor, the 
Rule Editor, the Rule Viewer, and the surface 
viewer. They are dynamically linked as any change 
done to the FIS eventually reflected to the system.  At 
first we use the FIS editor to design the system. B y 
typing Fuzzy in the command prompt let us open the 
FIS editor where seven inputs (Road 1, Road 2, Road  
3, Road 4, Road 5, Road6, Road 7) and one output 
(greentime) are set as discussed above in the secti on

 1.7 RESULT  
In this section, the performance of fuzzy logic 
controller is compared with fixed time controller i s 
evaluated and simulated by using MATLAB 
software. The performance is equated in terms of no  
of vehicles served and average delay. The simulatio n 
parameters and their description is given in table

Analysis  
The performance comparison between fixed time 
controller and fuzzy traffic controller is summariz ed 
in Table 6.2. As can be seen, the fuzzy logic 
controller shows about 28% decrease in time on 
average vehicle delay at the intersection and about  
15% increase on the total number of cars being 
served at the intersection. as traffic volume incre ases 
the fixed-time controllers perform much poorer that  
the fuzzy controller. The fuzzy controller is able to 
increase the green time to cater for the increasing  
traffic. When handling low volumes of traffic, both  
controllers perform more or less the same with the 
fixed controller. However, as the traffic volumes 
increased considerably, the performance of the fixed -
time controller reduces compared to that of the fuz zy 
logic controller. 
 1.8 Conclusion  
In this research work, traffic model and traffic 
controller are developed using MATLAB software. 
The fuzzy logic traffic controller system is presen ted 
that optimally manages the traffic flow would be 
achieved at the multiple intersections. To test the  
effectiveness of fuzzy logic controller to control the 
traffic flow at multiple intersection, MATLAB 
simulation has been done. The Comparison of the 
proposed controller with the fixed-time controller 
has shown overall, fuzzy logic controller shows 
better performance than fixed time controller for 
controlling traffic flow. As can be seen, performan ce 
of fuzzy logic controller is better than fixed-time  
controller in terms of average no. of vehicles and 
average delay. The extension time of the green phas e 
of the traffic lights is adjusted using Mamdani 
inference.  
 
1.9 Future Work 
In future, pedestrian control logic can be added 
with this fuzzy logic traffic controller. All the t raffic 
controller in the city can be connected by creating  
network connection and can communicate with each 
other with sending information about current traffi c 
situation of their intersections, which will be usin g as 
inputs for the fuzzy logic controller. On the basis  of 
these inputs the controller will produce output to 
better control of the congestion considering the 
current traffic situations of other neighbor traffi c 
controller’s intersection of the network. Multiple 
intersection is considered in this research, and th e 
next step is to apply Fuzzy logic controller to a f ive 
intersections network with a central intersection a nd 
four surrounding intersections. The other direction  of 
future work is to combine Fuzzy logic controller 
with other traditional algorithms for best 
performance with different traffic demand

Abstract 
The objective of this work is to develop an android  application capable of diagnosing and treating 
illness in livestock.  This work was motivated due to the high increase of infectious diseases amongst  
livestock and inability for livestock owners to hav e fast diagnosis and treatment of their birds. Top down 
approach was used in the system design of this work  in conjunction with expert system as its 
methodology, and an Android Studio software develop ment Platform was used in developing the 
application using extensible markup language (XML) for the front-end while Java and My structural 
Query Language (MySQL) was used for the back-end deve lopment. The expected result will be an expert 
system that provides both a mobile and web friendly  interface for vet doctors and livestock owners 
(farmers) to access medical information on livestoc k, diagnose and treat their birds, have accurate 
dosage on drugs and ask questions about their anima ls on a click.

Introduction 
Though large-scale agriculturalists have access 
to veterinary specialists and expert adviceboth 
for the general running of their farms and care 
of their animals and for the treatment of ill and 
wounded animals, many developing farmers 
lack the essential instance to consult these 
experts when the need ascends. This condition 
is also true for many people living in rural 
communities and informal settlements who own 
a small number of livestock, and for whom 
these animals represent a significant portion of 
their wealth. Now many instances when an 
animal belonging to someone in this position is 
ill, they may be unwilling to consult a vet owing 
to the cost involved, or may be entirely unable 
to do so, either as a result of a lack of instance 
or a lack of veterinarians in the area. An expert 
system accessible in remote areas capable of 
diagnosing ailments acting animals or advising 
on the necessity of consulting a vet could 
greatly assist developing agriculturalists and 
livestock owners. Therefore the System could 
actually provide a front-line diagnosis and 
treatment as well as advise the animal's owner on which further steps should be taken to save 
the injured or dying bird. Such a system could 
also assist in verifying the diagnosis of a vet or 
provide assistance to a vet in the diagnostic 
process. Owing to the potential users of such a 
system not having access to a personal 
computer (PC) during the normal course of their 
working day or while attending to a sick animal, 
if at all, the system should be designed to be 
accessible through a simple interface on a 
mobile phone and on the web. Most times these 
farmers administer wrong drugs to their birds in 
the case of try and error, for example giving the 
birds emzor paracetamol out of fear and 
curiosity of losing their birds. 
Furthermore actually understanding the true 
meaning of the word "Poultry" is a term used 
for any kind of domesticated bird, captive-raised 
for its utility, and traditionally the word has 
been used to refer to wildfowl (Galliformes) and 
waterfowl (Anseriformes) but not to cagebirds 
such as songbirds and parrots. "Poultry" can be 
defined as domestic fowls, including chickens, 
turkeys, geese and ducks, raised for the  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 198  
 production of meat or eggs and the word is also use d for the flesh of these birds used as food
. 
 
2. Literature Review 
The word expert system can be said to be a 
computer program or application that explains 
complex problems that would otherwise require 
extensive human expertise. This happens by 
mimicking the human reasoning process and by 
applying specific knowledge and interfaces. 
Expert system also uses human knowledge to 
solve problems that normally would require 
intelligence. This expert system shows the 
expertise knowledge as facts or rules within the 
computer. These rules and facts can be called 
upon when needed to solve problems. Books and 
manual guides have a brilliant amount of 
knowledge for it to be used [1]. 
Expert System typically has a number several 
components. The knowledge base is the 
component that contains the knowledge obtained 
from the domain expert. Normally, the way of 
representing knowledge is using rules; the 
inference engine is the component that allows the 
user to query the system and receive the results 
of query the system and receive the results of 
these queries [2]. 
Numerous expert systems also have an 
explanation capability which explains why a 
question was as or how a result or solution was 
obtained [3]. Expert system can be applied in 
various areas such as in Agriculture, Education, 
Environment, Law, Manufacturing, Medicine, 
Power systems and more, but in this research 
work, the researcher will review about 
Agriculture, Education, Environment, and 
Medical Expert System. These four application 
areas are widely used among the practitioners 
due to the maturity of the field by revealing the 
acceptance of the technology by the commercial 
sectors [4]. 
[5] the most common form of expert system is a 
computer program with a set of rules that 
analyzes information ( usually supplied by the 
user of the system) about a specific class of 
problem and commends one or more courses of 
user action. The Expert system may also provide 
mathematical analysis of problem(s). The Expert 
System utilizes what appears to be reasoning 
capabilities to reach conclusions. A related term is wizard: a wizard is an 
interactive computer program that helps a user 
solves a problem. Originally the term wizard was 
used for programs that construct a database 
search query base on criteria supplied by the 
user; however some rule-based Expert System is 
called wizards. Other “wizards” are a sequence 
of online forms that guide user through series of 
choices such as ones which manage the 
installation of new software on computers. And 
these are not Expert System [6]. 
3. Applications of Expert Systems 
Expert System can be applied in various 
discipline such as in Medicine, Agriculture, 
Engineering, and Education for instance 
application of expert system in medicine: 
This is to say that Medical Artificial Intelligence  
(MAI) in medicine is predominantly concern 
with the construction of Artificial Intelligence 
(AI) programs diagnosis and making therapy 
references or recommendations. Dissimilar 
Medical applications with other programming 
methods; such as purely statistical and 
probabilistic methods. Medical AI programs are 
based on symbolic models of entities and their 
relationship to patient factors and clinical signs 
[7]. 
 
1. Cancer detection (cadet):  
In medicine CADET is another computer-based 
clinical decision support system for early cancer 
detection; cancer risk assessment and early 
discovery are subject to serious limitations 
mainly related to human factors and the 
characteristics of the data involved. Overcoming 
this challenge or problems, a clearer clinical 
picture and aid in directing patients to 
appropriate measures paper presented at the 
international symposium on predictive oncology 
and intervention strategies paris, [8]. 
2. Diagnostic Explains (dxplain):  
Diagnostic Explains (DXplain) is a clinical 
decision support systems developed at the 
Massachussetts general hospital with the 
intention of assisting in test diagnosis. 
Furthermore, it is used to assist in the process of   
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 199  
 diagnosis, taking a set of clinical findings 
including signs, symptoms and laboratory data 
and then produces a ranked list of diagnosis. 
DXplain provides validation for each of the 
differential diagnosis and suggests further 
investigations. The system contains a database of 
crude probabilities for over 4,500 clinical 
manifestations that are associated with over 
2,000 different diseases [9]. 
3. Pathology Expert Interpretative 
Reporting System (Peirs): 
This is the type of expert system known as 
PEIRS which affixes explanatory comments to 
chemical pathology information where the 
knowledge acquisition strategy is the Ripple 
down Rules methods. 
These computer based system allow a pathologist 
to build over 2,300 rules without the knowledge 
of engineering or programming support.  With 
this expert system, new rules are added in 
minutes and repairs or maintenance tasks are a 
minor extension to the pathologist’s routines 
duties. PEIRS commented on about 100 reports 
daily. The domains covered include Typoid 
Function tests arterial Blood Gases, Glucose 
Tolerance tests, Catecholamine’s and a range of 
other hormones. The first implementation of 
PEIRS was at St. Vincent’s Hospital Sydney, but 
is now out of use while a new hospital 
information system is settling in. once this is 
stable, PEIRS will need to be interfaced into the 
system [7]. 
4. Medindia-Online Medical Consultation  
This is a consulting online system called 
Medindia’s panel where doctors provides one 
with an online solution to a problem but do not 
sell prescription. They only give advice and 
recommendations on their effectiveness. 
Consults will be only provided if considered 
safe. 
5. GIDEON : 
This is an expert system that provides decision 
support for generating a differential diagnosis 
and very useful resource for medical 
practitioners. GIDEON is use for areas that are 
difficult-to-identify infectious disease for 
patients with travel histories. It explains unusual  
disease patterns and helps to plan effective 
treatment GIDEON (1994-2012). Quick and 
accurate assistance to medical professionals with diagnosis, GIDEON is used to generate a ranked 
list of possible diseases based on signs, 
symptoms, and laboratory tests and expose 
history for any infectious disease, in any nation 
state of the world. Simulation by users are all 
possible such as Bio-terrorism Scenarios, an 
additional microbiology module is designed to 
identify or study any of the more than 2,500 
known human bacteria, fungi, and parasites [10]. 
6. MYCIN:  
This is a medical diagnosis expert system 
designed and known as (MYCIN) which was 
derived from the suffix “Mycin”, an antibiotics 
used to treat patients with bacteria. This great 
computer based expert system intends to provide 
physicians with advice about the diagnosis and 
drug therapy for bacterial infections. MYCIN is 
used to identify organisms responsible for an 
infection from information concerning the 
patient’s symptoms and test result. LISP 
programming language was used to develop this 
expert system as a doctoral dissertation of 
Edward Short life under the direction of Bruce 
Buchannan, Stanley N. Cohen and others.  [11],  
indicated that the development arose in the 
laboratory created earlier known as Dendral 
Expert System, but it rather emphasized the use 
of judgmental rules that had elements of 
uncertainty (known as certainty factors) 
associated with them. 
This computer based expert system was designed 
such that identification of bacteria’s causing 
severe infections, such as bacteremia and 
meningitis and to recommend antibiotics, with 
the dosage adjusted for patient’s body weight.  
7. DENDRAL:  
An artificial intelligence called Dendral was an 
influential pioneer project of the 1960’s, as a 
computer software expert system, which its sole 
primary aim was to study hypothesis formation 
and discovery in science. To achieve this, a 
specific task in science was chosen to help 
organic chemists in identifying unknown organic 
molecules, by analyzing their mass-spectra and 
using knowledge of chemistry [12]. 
These great achievement were  done by group of 
researchers namely: Edward Feigenbaum, Bruce 
G, Buchannan, Joshua Ledeberg, and Carl 
Djerassi at the Stanford University along with a  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 200  
 team of highly creative research associates and stu dents [13]. 
 
4. Characteristics of expert system . 
The major characteristics of expert systems 
include: 
1. High performance: they should perform at 
the level of human expert. 
2. Reliability: they must be reliable and 
should not crush. 
3. Adequate Response Time: they should have 
the ability to respond in real time. 
4. Understandable: they should be a black box 
instead it should be able to explain the steps of 
the reasoning process 
5. It should justify its conclusion, in the same 
way a human expert explains why he/she arrived 
at a particular conclusion. 
6. Symbolic logic. 
7. An explicit knowledge base understandable 
to professionals in the field. 
8. Ability to explain its conclusion in a 
meaningful way to its users. 
5. The Use of Mobile Phones Technology 
Mobile Technology, [14] stated that mobile 
technology is a digital information and 
communication service to users on the move, 
either through devics that are portable per sec, or  
through fixed devices that are easily ready at 
hand at theusers current position. [15] stated that  
development of previous expert systems were 
largely created for PCs, with network 
functionality not being considered. But the 
popularity of the Internet has seen many expert 
systems shifting to becoming web-based and 
employing a server-client structure, if beneficial,  
allowing for their distant updating and ensuring 
the latest information is utilized when a query is 
performed. Fast increase on the use of mobile 
phones more in particular the smartphones in the 
second half of 2000s influenced the number of 
expert system development targeting mobile 
phones. A mobile-oriented expert system makes 
sense when considering the general working 
conditions of agriculturalists. Sick animals are 
unlikely to be in the range of a desktop 
computer, or within the easy reach and use of a laptop computer, making a system targeted at 
such devices impractical. But in particular, a 
system where the user interface (UI) is presented 
on a mobile device and the processing is sent to a 
remote server over the Internet would be more 
practical, as this would provide the mobility 
required and also allow the system to be easily 
updated with the latest knowledge and rules, as 
well as adding the processing to a more powerful 
device than a phone, many of which have limited 
processing abilities.  
Even though the high-end smartphones today do 
boast remarkable management power and 
storage, consequently it is unlikely that the 
focused users of the system would have ready 
access to such mobile phones technologies. 
Furthermore, use of mobile phone by farmers 
will go a long way in improving the economy of 
any nation more especially growing economy 
like Nigeria where some of their population 
living in the rural areas depends on agriculture as  
a mean of livelihood.  Expert systems on a 
mobile phone will aid the farmers to diagnose 
and acquire relevant information to handle their 
birds and in such provide more meat for the 
consumption of the entire country.  
6.Methodology Adopted  
  An expert system is a computer program that 
solves complicated problems that would 
otherwise require extensive human expertise 
whose primary aim is to store the knowledge 
gathered from various experts by the knowledge 
engineer, so that programs can process it, 
achieve the verisimilitude (similar) of human 
intelligence and also to represent knowledge in a 
manner so as to facilitate inference i.e. drawing 
conclusions from knowledge by the use of an 
inference engine. To do so, it simulates the 
human reasoning process by applying specific 
knowledge and inference. These rules and data 
can be called upon when needed to solve 
problems.  
An Expert System is typically made up of the 
following components
:

Expert System Components  
 
 
 
Knowledge acquisition subsystem: the main 
source of knowledge was published materials, 
internet and also through (interview questions and 
answers) gotten from experienced poultry farmers 
at prefab housing estate Aladinmm Owerri and 
Imo State University Owerri (IMSU) Poultry 
Farms. The knowledge had been built according 
to the selection criteria, before design, the 
knowledge was gotten and given to vet doctors for 
critic recommendation and modification.  
Knowledge base: At this stage it is referred to as 
the component that contains the knowledge 
obtained from the domain expert. The way of 
representing knowledge in an expert system is 
using rules and is called knowledge 
representation. For this work, all knowledge base 
facts and rules are stored in the database which 
will be designed with MySQL database software. 
Explanation subsystem: A subsystem that 
explains the system's actions. Here deals with the 
solution of each asked problem or explains why a 
question was asked or how a result or solution 
was obtained. 
Inference engine: The inference engine performs 
the role of inferring the required decision from th e 
knowledge base to the user interface. In the 
proposed expert system; forward and backward 
chaining engine was used.  
User interface: The interactions between the users 
and the system were supported through a friendly 
graphical user interface running under windows 
environment. For the purpose of this work “An 
Android Mobile Information System for 
Diagnosis and Treatment of Livestock”  which 
requires that a computer program is used to 
simulate the human reasoning process by applying 
a specific knowledge and inferences, to solve complicated livestock health challenges, using a 
set of rules that analyzes the information 
(symptoms, usually supplied by the users/farmers 
of the system) about a specific class of 
problem(disease) and recommends one or more 
course of action and method they normally use in 
treating such disease, which require a high degree 
of expertise (equal or better than its human 
counterpart (vet Doctors) and a rich knowledge 
base. The methodology that possesses these 
characteristic and fits into this description is no  
other but an EXPERT SYSTEM; thus it is 
suitable for the development of the “Android 
Mobile Information System for Diagnosis and 
Treatment of Livestock” and as such is adopted 
for the purpose of this research work. Figure 1: 
above explains the stages and components 
adopted for the Livestock Expert System. 
7. Advantages of the New System 
The researcher could have not considered carrying 
out this work if not because of its advantages or 
importance to farmers. Therefore this proposed 
system has some much advantages over the 
existing manual consultation by vet doctors and 
treatment of birds. Below are some of the 
identified advantages:  
1. Improvement of good health and 
productivity of livestock’s within the society. 
2. Promote fast diagnosis and treatment of 
birds. 
3. Promotion of good and healthy meat 
production.  
4. As a proper way of alleviating poverty and 
encourage local farmers.  
5. Promote confidence for farmers and 
people that would like to start up their own small 
or large-scale poultry farming.  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 202  
 8. System Design and Implementations 
System design deals with putting solutions to the 
problems with the available resources. It is the 
blue print of the system that is to be developed. 
Therefore, software life cycle requires some basic 
activities which include: Decomposition of the 
entire system into components: Identification of 
the system architecture including various menu and screen displays, how the system can be 
installed, the hardware and software 
specifications/requirements for the installation of  
the system and how to start up the system, 
Component of the proposed system and their 
relationship as well as its dependencies are 
covered, and Inter component communication 
mechanism are also achieved.

9. System Description  
The system also has a module where the 
farmer (user) could give feedback for further 
improvement or any report.The proposed 
system has two main modules, and more than 
four sub modules. Below is the description of 
the entire modules in this proposed system. 
a) Livestock Information Module: This 
module enable the users or future farmers who 
wish to make an enquire on the various 
information about poultry farming. b) Famers Module: Through this module, 
farmers could check for poultry diseases and the 
best treatment to give to the birds during 
emergency. 
c) Vet Doctors Module: The vet doctors could 
make use of this module to update the application 
by uploading relevant information, diagnosis and 
treatment about poultry farming.

10. Choice and Justification of Programming 
Language Platform  
The proposed system is an android mobile 
information system for diagnosis and treatment of 
livestock. The front end was designed with 
extensible markup language (XML) while the 
backend was done with an object oriented 
programming language known as java and 
MySQL. The system has an easy and simple 
friendly interface design such as the user only tap  
the icon of the application from his/her android 
mobile phone after the installation of the raw file , 
which will launch the platform where the user can 
enter a search word (symptom) identified from the 
livestock after which a search key (button) is 
clicked. The system brings out the result of the 
search displaying the causes of the illness, drugs to 
be used for the treatment, and procedure of 
administering the drugs to the livestock’s.  The 
figure 4 above displays how the forward and 
backward chain communication flows between the 
user and the android expert system 
Java: This is an object oriented programming 
language owned by oracle microsystems. It is one 
of the best object oriented language and very good 
in data security more especially development of 
android nd enterprise application.Extensible 
Markup Language (XML): This is a scripting language used in development of front end 
applications. 
 
MySQL Database:   
MySQL is an open source database management 
system with features as listed below; 
• MySQL is a relational database management 
system that stores information in different tables,  
rather than in one giant table. These tables can be  
referenced to each other, to access and maintain 
data easily. 
• MySQL is open source database system 
software and can be used and modified by anyone 
according to their needs. 
• It is fast, reliable and easy to use.

11. Conclusion  
The proposed livestock expert system was 
designed such that it can accept 
informationfrom a user about a bird, its health 
and vaccination history and other sick birds  it 
may have come into contact with. Using 
information about a broad range of symptoms 
the animal is displaying, the proposed system 
can determine an initial list of possible diseases 
which it should query. After querying the user 
regarding detailed symptoms which the bird is 
displaying, the proposed system utilizes this 
information, and the information about the bird collected previously, to determine a diagnosis. 
Livestock owners will find it easy and cost free 
if they adopt this new technology of diagnosing 
and treating their birds beforehand. 
 
12. Recommendations for Further Studies 
Therefore this study recommends the 
following: 
• Develop an android/web based that could 
cover diagnosis and treatment of other livestock 
like cow, goat etc. 
• Another researcher could also look at the 
development of an application that could locate 
a vet doctor from a particular location.

Abstract 
Two-way seamless communication is the key aspect of  realizing the vision of mobile communications. 
There are several standardized wired and wireless c ommunication technologies available for various 
mobile communication applications. With the recent growth in wireless communication, it can offer 
standardized technologies for wide, metropolitan, l ocal and personal area networks. Moreover, wireless  
technologies not only offer significant benefits ov er wired, such that include low installation cost, rapid 
deployment, mobility, etc., but also more suitable f or remote end applications. Several activities are 
going on to explore specific applications of these technologies in mobile communication environment. 
However, the afore-mention is beset with numerous c hallenges ranging from poor supervision by the 
regulatory agency like National Communication Commi ssion (NCC) in the case of Nigeria, bad network 
communication infrastructures leading to poor servi ce delivery. All these have made the usage of 
communication infrastructures like the GSM Mobile c ommunication unattractive to some extent. This 
paper discusses the great challenges of continued p roblems of poor mobile communication 
infrastructures like low power mobile communication , poor network connections, drop calls and 
insecurity among others and the subsequent challeng es arising from these such as poor service 
deliverables. The work will attempt to proffer solu tions to all these and make recommendations for the  
way forward. 
 Keywords:   Communication, Infrastructure, Service Delivery, deliverables, Seamless Communication,

1.0 Introduction  
 
Microsoft Encarta, the world encyclopedia 
(2008)posits: 
“Communicationis the process of transmitting and 
receiving ideas, information, and messages. The 
rapid transmissions of information over long 
distances and ready access to information have 
become conspicuous and important features of 
human society, especially in the past 150 years, 
and in the past two decades, increasingly so.” 
Thus, Mobile communication is a communication 
network that does not involve cable or wire 
connection between two entities. The current 
mobile communications technologies are Global 
System for Mobile Communications (GSM), and 
Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), among 
others. 
 Nonetheless, INSPEC (2005) posits that Mobile 
phone subscriptions have grown. Since the 
liberalization of Nigeria’s telecommunication 
sector in 2000, the industry has become the key 
source of new jobs in the economy, employing 
about 6,000 professionals, and overseeing, 
indirectly close to half a million jobs. It believe s 
that the increases in mobile coverage have many 
more advantages like improving faster and 
cheaper communication. For example, in India, 
fishermen can reduce fish wastage by phoning in 
advance coastal markets to find out their supply 
needs. Mobile banking also offers the flexibility 
and convenience for many customers too. 
 
The increase in mobile technology has also led to 
a growing attraction for mobile telephones as 
health interventions. This attraction has been 
influenced by, among other things, the fact that  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 210  
 mobile phones are functionally easier to use for 
people with lower levels of skills than those 
needed for computers or the internet. Irrespective 
of whether mobile phones are functionally easier 
to use for those with lower level or higher level 
skills, mobile communication phones have 
become useful in data collection of health-related 
information.   
 
Erkki Liikanen (2004), explaining the key 
challenges  for mobile communications, called for 
the exploitation of the social and economic 
benefits of it even in the midst those challenges. 
He said that with penetration rates in excess of 
80%, it was then well recognized that Nigeria has 
some leadership in mobile communication 
infrastructures made possible by determined and 
concerted action of the government and the 
players in the field. Research and Development 
efforts, according to him, were also been 
coordinated with standardization, interoperability 
and the right regulatory and political environment 
much as paradigm shift is being witnessed as new 
mobile data services  emerge. 
 
The convergence of telecommunications, 
broadcasting and internet will further result in th e 
proliferation of high-speed multimedia services 
delivered over mobile networks. Users can avail 
themselves of high-speed wireless access with the 
receipt of 3G services and more over a wider area. 
The global landscape for mobile and wireless 
communications is also changing as many 
countries are investing heavily in research for the  
sake of gaining a competitive advantage. Liikanen 
believes that interoperability, the regulatory 
environment for content and spectrum policy 
are the major challenges.  To him the emergence 
of new mobile data services is significant because 
investing in ICT, re-organizing enterprises 
between the operators and investing in training 
and skills could result in the achievement of major  
productivity increases in that sector.  
 
As the next wave of productivity at work points to 
mobility and sharing information, Enterprises will benefit from mobility by 
extending the wired network to mobile users 
With secure, reliable mobile applications enabling 
them to communicate anytime, 
Anywhere. This shall make future mobile 
communications focus on mobile data services 
that will give the possibility of access to shared 
databases anytime, anywhere.  
 
Global competitiveness needs innovative 
capability and cost-efficiency. Nigeria must focus 
on innovation as a key driver of competitiveness. 
This can only be achieved through a 
comprehensive programme of integrated research 
activities. Three main trends dominate research 
and development today. First , increasing 
complexity,  second , increasing interdependencies 
between products and services, and third , the 
growing competition at a global scale – all aim to 
achieve common goals and shape the future 
according to  needs and shared values.  
 
Innovation dynamics and the process of 
innovation itself have changed to collaboration 
across the traditional boundaries in 
telecommunication sector which needs to be 
catalyzed by public action. This is important 
especially when we look at areas where the 
technology innovation meets application 
innovation. Bringing these together into systemic 
innovation leads to new growth curves; a real 
challenge for Nigerian research is to be able to 
support the transition to new paradigms, and new 
growth curves effectively. 
 
1.1    Background of the Study 
Jide Ojo (2010) posits that since its inauguration 
in 2002, GSM services in Nigeria has been 
inundated with poor network signals, collection of 
money for non-committed voice and data 
services, over congestion, drop calls, delayed 
voice and data services and lack of adequate 
information or answers on why these inadequacies 
do occur. This is in addition to the theft of servi ce 
by stealing the cell phone that houses the SIM 
card, inversion of privacy through hacking or 
cracking encrypted algorithms, unlawful  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 211  
 interception of GSM communications by law 
enforcement agencies: this is generally done by 
accessing the digital switches that control calls. 
 
Other challenges include poor Quality of Service 
(QoS) rendered by the operators with the Nigeria 
Communications Commission (NCC), that 
regulates the industry, recently expressing its 
intention to slam huge fines (on a monthly basis) 
on the operators to that effect.  This is in additi on 
to twin problems of infrastructure decay 
(particularly epileptic power generation) and poor 
security, among others. These therefore are some 
of the challenges people face in the effective 
utilization of the GSM infrastructure in Nigeria 
and it is on this basis that this work is being 
designed. 
 
1.2 Objective of the Research 
The primary objective of this project is to explore 
the challenges of improving the services of 
mobile communication in Nigeria. The expected 
outcomes shall include, among others to: 
 Broaden the scope of knowledge in GSM 
mobile communication in the country; 
 Provide additional research materials for 
researchers and practitioners in the field; 
 Critically examine these challenges with a 
view to proffering solutions to them for 
the sake of having a better mobile 
communication infrastructure.  
 Provide a substrate upon which further 
researches in the area could be built. 
 
1.3 Research Hypothesis  
Ho: Poor network infrastructure and high tariffs 
have no relationship with poor service 
delivery 
H1: Poor network infrastructure and high tariff 
have a relationship with poor service 
delivery. 
1.4   Research Methodology  
For the sake of implementing this research work, 
the internationally accepted software engineering 
standard called Structured System Analysis and 
Design Methodology (SSADM) was used. The 
justification for choosing SSADM in place of other engineering methods as approved by IEE 
was its waterfall techniques by which systems 
designs are easily achieved. According to Stalker 
(1961) SSADM involves the following steps: 
i. Formulating the Research Problem (Problem 
Definition) 
ii. Extensive Literature Review  
iii. Feasibility Studies 
iv. Developing the objectives  
v. Systems Analysis 
vi. Preparing the Research Design including 
Sample Design 
vii. Collecting the Data 
viii. Analysis of Data 
ix. Generalization and Interpretation 
x. Coding /Testing and 
xi. Implementation 
xii. Preparation of the Report or Presentation of 
Results- Formal write ups of                 
Conclusions reached. 
xiii. Support & Maintenance 
 
1.5   Scope of Study 
The scope of the project would include:  
• Exploring the challenges of improving the 
services of mobile communication in 
Nigeria and  
• Making recommendations on the way 
forward for the mobile communication 
industry.  
 
 
1.6   Statement of Problem 
The work aims to explore the challenges of 
improving the services of mobile 
communication in Nigeria since according 
to a report by GSM World (1999), 80 
percent of the global mobile market uses 
GSM services, which faces several problems 
as a worldwide standard for mobile 
telephones.  These, according to Bredin, J., 
et al (1999,pages 43-49) and supported by 
Jide Ojo (2010), include:  
• Twin problems of infrastructure decay 
(particularly epileptic power generation) and 
poor security.  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 212  
 • Poor quality of service rendered by the 
operators for which the Nigeria 
Communications Commission (NCC), is the 
regulator; 
• Invasion of privacy through hacking or 
cracking encrypted algorithms 
throughunlawful interception of GSM 
communications by law enforcement 
agencies. 
• Poor signals, collecting money for non-
committed voice and data services, over 
congestion, drop calls, delayed voice and 
data services;  
• Theft of service by stealing the cell phone 
that houses the SIM card  
• Parlous state of the network due to inability 
to plan for the failure of public infrastructure 
like National Power Supply, among others. 
• Thin resources of trained man power and 
infrastructural deficiency such as poor 
power supply;  
• Nefarious activities of social miscreants and 
some fastidious (hard to please) 
communities, who don’t see anything good 
in any developmental project, inter alia. 
 
Thus the above challenges are living with GSM 
services in Nigeria and elsewhere in the world. 
Various researches in the area have not been able 
to totally address these problems. Hence this 
project is poised to make further impact in the 
field with a view to proffering solutions to the 
challenges of improving the services of mobile 
communication Network in Nigeria.  The 
above-mentioned problems are cases in point. 
1.7    Significance of Study 
According to Jide Ojo (2010), GSM services in 
Nigeria have been inundated with: poor network 
signals, collection of money for non-committed 
voice and data services, over congestion, drop 
calls, delayed voice and data services, etc. The 
solution to poor networks could range from 
further increase of network facilities to the 
provision of better transmitting equipment. Collection of money for non-committed services 
could be reduced by a better network management 
infrastructure while over congestion could be 
managed by further expansion of bandwidth, 
backbones and moving to the latest Generation of 
GSM infrastructural facilities like 3G, 3.5G or 
even 4G and EDGE.  
 
The above study would be quite significant in the 
following ways: 
i. finding solutions to the afore-mentioned 
challenges will help improve subscribers’ 
confidence in GSM services 
ii. Users of GSM phones will find it useful  
iii. It will also help the operators of the 
business to provide user-friendly program 
to their subscribers. 
iv. The government and the regulators will 
also benefit from the number of added 
users as a result of improved service of the 
operators   
v. It will encourage research and 
development in the field 
vi. The software will provide jobs to the 
teaming jobless youths, who would use it 
in their business centers to better GSM 
services 
vii. It would be used as a reference material by 
the scholars and researchers in the field. 
 
1.8       Limitations of Study 
Due to limited time and resource, the project will 
be restricted to  exploring the challenges of 
improving the services of mobile 
communication in Nigeria.  It will attempt to 
develop software that answers questions on GSM 
– oriented mobile communication concept with a 
view to further informing and educating the 
stakeholders on GSM project. 
 
2.0 Global  System Of Mobile 
Communication (Gsm) 
Jide Ojo (2010) posits that the GSM system was 
initially designed as a second generation (2G) 
cellular phone technology. One of the basic aims  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 213  
 was to provide a system that would enable greater 
capacity to be achieved than the previous first 
generation analogue systems. GSM achieved this 
by using a digital TDMA (Time Division Multiple 
Access) approach. By adopting this technique, 
more users could be accommodated within the 
available bandwidth. In addition to this, ciphering  
of the digitally encoded speech was adopted to 
retain privacy. Using the earlier analogue cellular  
technologies, it was possible for anyone with a 
scanner receiver to listen to calls though a number  
of famous personalities had been "eavesdropped" 
with embarrassing consequences. 
Realizing the importance of GSM technology, a 
plan to implement a pan-Nigeria mobile phone 
network was hatched and a committee on GSM 
Group was set up. In 1989, work done by the 
GSM group was transferred to the Nigeria 
Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI). 
Further works led to the development of a 
sophisticated digital cell phone system, whose 
design aims included: good subjective speech 
quality; a low phone or terminal cost and 
handheld; support international roaming; good 
spectral efficiency and   offer ISDN compatibility,  
among others. 
The resulting GSM cellular technology that was 
developed provided for all these. The overall 
system definition for GSM describes not only the 
air interface but also the network or infrastructur e 
technology. By adopting this approach it is 
possible to define the operation of the whole 
network to enable international roaming as well as 
enabling network elements from different 
manufacturers to operate alongside each other, 
although this last feature is not completely true, 
especially with older items. 
 2.1   GSM Services 
Speech or voice calls are obviously the primary 
function for the GSM cellular system. To achieve 
this, the speech is digitally encoded and later 
decoded using a vocoder. A variety of vocoders 
are available for use, being aimed at different 
scenarios. In addition to the voice services, GSM 
cellular technology supports a variety of other 
data services. Although their performance is 
nowhere near the level of those provided by 3G, 
they are nevertheless still important and useful. A  
variety of data services are supported with user 
data rates up to 9.6 kbps. Services including 
Group 3 facsimile, videotext and teletex can also 
be supported. 
One service that has grown enormously is the 
short message service. Developed as part of the 
GSM specification, it has also been incorporated 
into other cellular technologies. It can be thought  
of as being similar to the paging service but is fa r 
more comprehensive allowing bi-directional 
messaging, store and forward delivery, and it also 
allows alphanumeric messages of a reasonable 
length. This service has become particularly 
popular, initially with the young as it provided a 
simple, low fixed cost. 
 
2.5     GSM Architecture  
GSM cellular technology uses 200 kHz RF channels. 
These are time division multiplexed to enable up 
to eight users to access each carrier. In this way it 
is a TDMA / FDMA system. The BASE 
Transceiver Stations (BTS ) are organised into 
small groups, controlled by a Base Station 
Controller (BSC ) which is typically co-located 
with one of the BTSs. The BSC with its 
associated BTSs is termed the Base Station 
Subsystem (BSS).

Further into the core network is the MAIN 
SWITCHING AREA . This is known as the 
Mobile Switching Centre (MSC).  Associated 
with it is the Location Registers,  namely the 
Home Location Register(HLR)  and the Visitor 
Location Register (VLR)  which track the 
location of mobiles and enable calls to be routed 
to them.  
The above is a simplified diagram of a GSM 
technology. We shall see more of this in the 
course of the tutorial. Now, we shall illustrate on e 
of the elements. 
 Mobile Station 
According to Radio Electronics (2005), Mobile 
stations (MS), mobile equipment (ME) or as they 
are most widely known, cell or mobile phones are 
the section of a GSM cellular network that the 
user sees and operates. It was said that the sizes of 
these equipment have fallen dramatically over the 
years while the level of functionality has greatly 
increased. A further advantage is that the time 
between charges has significantly increased. 
There are a number of elements to the cell phone, 
although the two main elements are the main 
Hardware and the SIM as shown below.

3.0     Challenges Of Mobile (Gsm) Technology  
According to Eric Hammer, an eHow Contributor 
(Apr 09, 2012) GSM technology, which stands for 
Global Standard for Mobile Communications, is 
the mobile phone technology standard used in the 
United States by T-Mobile and AT&T. It is also 
used in Nigeria and in many other countries in the 
world. However, there are some problems with 
the technology, some of which can be solved by 
switching to the more modern CDMA standard 
(used in the United States by Verizon Wireless 
and Sprint-Nextel). He maintained that the 
challenges of mobile GSM mobile 
communication include: 
Dropped and Missed Calls: He quoted Cellular 
News as saying that call quality problems, 
including dropped calls and missed calls are 
common problems with GSM technology. These 
problems result directly from the technology in 
use. GSM technology cannot accommodate as 
many callers on a single cell tower as the more 
modern CDMA technology. This means that 
callers in areas where there are not a 
preponderance of cell towers may find that the 
call problems on GSM will be more common. 
Security Issues:  he said that zdnet UK reports 
that GSM has a serious security flaw, 
demonstrated by a hacker who was able to 
intercept phone calls from a number of GSM-
based cellular phones. The problem is based 
directly on the technology according to this 
hacker and his solution was to "turn off" the GSM 
technology (only the older 2G technology though) 
that is commonly used by people all over the 
world. The problem is largely mitigated however 
by the use of the more modern 3G technology that 
is commonly used (as of November, 2010) on 
many GSM phones. 
 Efficiency:  he also said that a nother problem 
with GSM is a network problem rather than a 
consumer problem, though it is a consumer 
problem for those who don't want to see a 
proliferation of cellular towers. As previously 
noted, GSM technology can handle fewer callers 
on a single cellular tower. Therefore, networks 
who work with GSM must find ever more areas to 
build GSM cellular towers, causing them to have 
problems with costs and locations. By the same 
token, some consumers who prefer not to see a 
proliferation of cellular towers consider this a 
problem because the cellular towers must be 
placed in more and more urban areas, potentially 
spreading more radiation and causing what some 
consider a blight on the landscape. 
Online Journal of Public Health Informatics * 
ISSN 1947-2579 * http://ojphi.org* Vol.4, No. 3, 
2012, further identified the following as 
challenges of mobile communication:  
 
Poor mobile network coverage across many 
parts of Nigeria. Intermittent mobile network 
from the providers contributes to the high 
discharge rate of mobile phones since subscribers 
often have to keep trying a line for several times 
before they get connected. Eventually, some of 
the mobile phone subscribers in the NHDSS study 
area end up forgetting (except those who are able 
to save their numbers elsewhere) their mobile 
numbers since the network coverage is virtually 
non-existent.  
Our team has experienced this during data 
collection of migration events. A respondent who 
reports that some of the household’s members 
have migrated to another area is asked for the 
mobile phone number of the migrant. In many 
instances, fieldworkers are not able to get the 
mobile numbers because the respondents do not 
know the numbers. When asked reasons for not 
knowing the numbers, majority of them 
sarcastically state that there is no need to know 
the number since there is no mobile network 
coverage in their area unless they go to the 
Zamfara State capital, Gusau. 
  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 216  
  Limited power supply  efforts to expedite data 
collection and processing are compromised by the 
virtually non-existent power supply, future efforts  
to link the HDSS activities with those of the 
adjacent Nahuche Health Research Centre in 
tracking immunization defaulters through mobile 
phone technology (i.e., alerts on service uptake) 
will be challenging. 
 
High tariff charges on communication . 
Nahuche posits ‘Our field workers often complain 
about high tariff on airtime recharge cards. They 
are often unable to call the field office at the 
Nahuche Research Centre due to insufficient 
airtime on their mobile phones. While high tariff 
charges can be managed through budgetary 
allocation for airtime purchases, the power 
supply and mobile network coverage remain 
an enormous challenge for field operations.’ 
3.1       Panacea for The Challenges Above 
The answer is simple but doing it is an enormous 
task.  
• Constant Power Supply:   
Nigeria’s power supply is currently erratic and 
insufficient. Generally, there is no difference 
between the rural and the urban areas except for 
the fact that the urban areas by virtue of their 
status as ‘business hubs’ tend to push consumers 
to use electric generators more than often the rura l 
areas. Solar energy, described as the best form of 
renewable energy, has a very high investment cost 
but the life span of the solar panel could be as 
long as 25 years  if  they are properly installed. 
Nevertheless, some anecdotal evidence shows that 
in some states in Nigeria solar panels have failed 
to deliver the expected results due to corrupt 
practices associated with procurement of 
substandard panels. Irrespective of this, solar 
energy is never exhausted unlike the conventional 
energy of oil, coal, and gas.  
 
• Strong Network Coverage In All 
Communities.  
This will go a long way to ameliorating drop 
and aborted but charged for calls witnessed on daily basis by the mobile communication 
subscribers. 
 
4.0      MATERIALS AND METHODS 
4.1     Research Hypothesis  
Ho: Poor network infrastructure and high tariffs 
have no relationship with poor service delivery 
H1 :  Poor network infrastructure and high tariff 
have a relationship with poor service delivery 
 
4.2    The Population 
The population would consist of the general 
public particularly students of Imo State 
University, Federal University of Technology, 
Alvan Ikoku Federal College of Education, and 
Ekeonunwa Market, all in Owerri, Imo State, 
Nigeria. 
 
4.3     The Sample and the Sampling Technique 
By the simple lottery method of selection, four 
tertiary institutions and a market located within 
and around Owerri Area of Imo State would be 
randomly selected. A total of five hundred (500) 
respondents from these sampled institutions 
would be expected to respond to the 
questionnaire. The responses would be regarded 
as the observed frequencies of this research. 
 
One hundred respondents would be selected from 
each of the five sampled areas using simple 
balloting with replacement technique. Each of the 
respondents would have equal chance of being 
selected so as to make the sampling fair. 
 
4.4     Instrument of Data Collection 
 Measuring devices that would be utilized in 
this study would be of three forms: 
a) Questionnaire  
b) Oral interview (or opinionnaire)  
c) Life observation of complaints made by 
GSM mobile communication users.  
The questionnaire  would be designed to find out 
the challenges of telecommunication in Nigeria.  
It would consist of four sections: A, B, C, D and E  
Section A would test those statements that would 
reveal role of Poor mobile network coverage in 
necessitating poor service delivery of GSM 
mobile communication in Nigeria.  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 217  
 Section B would test the role of limited power 
supply in necessitating poor service delivery of 
GSM mobile communication in Nigeria while 
Section D would test the role of high tariffs in 
necessitating poor service delivery of GSM 
mobile communication in Nigeria. 
 Section E would consist of open-ended questions 
to be used for further investigation and 
discussions. 
Oral interview would comprise four simple 
questions in order to find out from respondents on 
their experience in the use of GSM mobile 
communication system. 
 In furtherance of concretizing the possible 
service delivery failures as a result of poor 
systemic errors of mobile communication 
equipment, life observation of mobile calls would 
be used by the researcher. It would be used to 
further explore the attitudes of the respondents 
toward GSM mobile communication usage. 
 
4.5     Method of Data Collection 
 A face-to-face administration of the 
questionnaire would be used. Such would de used 
also for oral interviews for the respondents. While  
the first four sections of the questionnaire would 
be structured, the last part would be open-headed. 
One of the reasons for this would be to make the 
subject less suspicious of the researcher’s 
intentions. Live observation of calls would be 
made. A total of one week would be expected to 
be used to administer and collect the data for the 
study. 
 
4.6      Method of Data Analysis 
The information collected through the 
questionnaire, oral interview and life observation 
of the respondents would be used to find out those 
research assumptions made earlier on. Among  the five sections of the questionnaire, 
four sections A,B,C and D would be used to test 
first, second, third and fourth factors of bad GSM 
infrastructure and its twin consequence of poor 
service delivery respectively. The fifth section 
would be used during discussions of findings. 
Responses to each item in the scale would be 
scored as in the Fido Gayford (1982) five-point 
Likert scale responses of Strongly Agree, Agree 
(A), Strongly Disagree (SD), Disagree (D) and 
Undecided (U) 
 
The non-parametric test of Chi-Square (X2) 
belonging to Inferential statistics theory would 
be used for illustrations and analysis.  
 
4.7    Decision Rule 
The χ2 test of independence is to be used to test 
whether the distribution of the outcome variable is  
similar across the comparison groups. Here we 
rejected H 0 and conclude that the distribution of 
poor service delivery is not independent of bad 
GSM infrastructure, or that there is a relationship  
between bad GSM infrastructure and poor service 
delivery. The test provides an overall assessment 
of statistical significance. When the null 
hypothesis is rejected, it is important to review t he 
sample data to understand the nature of the 
relationship.

5.1     Testing the hypothesis  
Ho: Poor mobile network coverage, poor GSM 
technology, limited power supply and high tariffs,  
have no relationship with poor service delivery 
(e.g. High discharge rate of mobile phones due to 
longer trials of calls, drop calls, hacking, poor d ata 
collection and processing and low calls rate due to  
low credit on mobile phones) 
H1 :  Poor network infrastructure and high tariff 
have a relationship with poor service delivery. We now wish to assess whether there is a 
relationship between bad GSM infrastructure and 
poor service delivery. As part of the same survey, 
respondents were asked how their different 
networks served them where they lived. The 
response options were low calls rate, High drop 
calls rate, Voice/data hacking, etc. The data are

Based on the data, the question is: is there a 
relationship between Bad GSM infrastructure 
andPoor service delivery ? Do you think that the 
type of network a person uses affects his services 
from such network? Here we have four 
independent comparison groups (bad GSM 
infrastructure consisting of four variables) and a 
discrete (ordinal) outcome variable with three 
response options. We specifically want to test whether bad GSM infrastructure and poor service 
delivery are independent. We will run the test 
using the five-step approach.   
Step 1.  Set up hypotheses and determine level of 
significance.

delivery are independent

 The null and research hypotheses are written in 
words rather than in symbols. The research 
hypothesis is that the grouping variable (bad GSM 
infrastructure) and the outcome variable (poor 
service delivery) are dependent or related.    
Step 2.   Select the appropriate test statistic.   
The formula for the test statistic is: 
  . 
The condition for appropriate use of the above test  
statistic is that each expected frequency is at lea st 
5. In Step 4 we will compute the expected 
frequencies and we will ensure that the condition 
is met. 
Step 3.  Set up decision rule.   
The decision rule depends on the level of 
significance and the degrees of freedom, defined 
as df = (r-1)(c-1), where r and c are the numbers o f 
rows and columns in the two-way data table.   The 
row variable is the bad GSM infrastructure and 
there are 4 arrangements considered, thus r=4. The 
column variable is poor service delivery and 3 
responses are considered, thus c = 3. For this test , df = (4-1)(3-1) = 3(2) = 6. Again, with χ2 tests 
there are no upper, lower or two-tailed tests.  
If the null hypothesis is true, the observed and 
expected frequencies will be close in value and the  
χ2 statistic will be close to zero. If the null 
hypothesis is false, then the χ2 statistic will be 
large. The rejection region for the χ2 test of 
independence is always in the upper (right-hand) 
tail of the distribution. For df = 6 and a 5% level  
of significance, the appropriate critical value is 
12.59 and the decision rule is as follows: Reject 
H0 if c 2> 12.59. 
Step 4.    Compute the test statistic.   
We now compute the expected frequencies  using 
the formula, 
Expected Frequency = (Row Total * Column 
Total)/N.  
The computations can be organized in a two-way 
table. The top number in each cell of the table is 
the observed frequency and the bottom number is 
the expected frequency.   The expected 
frequencies are shown in parentheses.

 Notice that the expected frequencies are taken to 
one decimal place and that the sums of the 
observed frequencies are equal to the sums of the 
expected frequencies in each row and column of 
the table.   
Recall in Step 2 a condition for the appropriate 
use of the test statistic was that each expected 
frequency is at least 5. This is true for this samp le 
(the smallest expected frequency is 9.6) and 
therefore it is appropriate to use the test statist ic. 
The test statistic is computed as follows: 
 
 = 5.78 + 1.56 + 6.78 + 5.75 + 5.41 + 1.63 + 
10.05 + 5.56 + 6.54 + 5.23 + 4.01 + 2.20 = 60.5. Step 5.  Conclusion.   
We reject H 0 because 60.5 >  12.59. We have 
statistically significant evidence at a =0.05 to 
show that H 0 is false or that bad GSM 
infrastructure and poor service delivery are 
not independent (i.e., they are dependent or 
related), p < 0.005.   
Again, the χ2 test of independence is used to 
test whether the distribution of the outcome 
variable is similar across the comparison 
groups. Here we rejected H 0 and concluded 
that the distribution of poor service delivery is 
not independent of bad GSM infrastructure, or 
that there is a relationship between bad GSM 
infrastructure and poor service delivery. The 
test provides an overall assessment of 
statistical significance. When the null 
hypothesis is rejected, it is important to review 
the sample data to understand the nature of 
the relationship. Consider again the sample 
data.

 Because there are different numbers of 
respondents in each experimental situation, it 
makes the comparisons of exercise patterns 
difficult on the basis of the frequencies alone. 
The following table displays the percentages of 
respondents in each service delivery category by bad GSM infrastructural plan. The 
percentages sum to 100% in each row of the 
table. For comparison purposes, percentages 
are also shown for the total sample along the 
bottom row of the table.

From the above, it is clear that higher 
percentages of respondents in Poor mobile 
network coverage and poor GSM technology 
reported Voice/data hacking (31% and 23%) 
as compared to respondents on limited power 
supply and high tariffs in same voice/data 
hacking (10% each).   
 
 
Discussion and Findings 
From the above experiment, it was evident 
that there is a close relationship between Bad 
GSM mobile communication infrastructure 
and poor service delivery. We therefore reject 
the null hypothesis that says otherwise. We 
can attribute Problems encountered in the use 
of GSM mobile communication like poor 
services, huge amount of money paid for 
services not rendered, bad network, hacking 
or tampering with user’s privacy in the 
network and poor NCC regulation to bad 
infrastructural conditions of networks 
operated in Nigeria.   
 
6.0    Summary  
The reach of mobile communication goes far 
beyond the industry itself. It encompasses 
systemic innovation. Hence the development 
of collaboration platforms for services is of 
utmost importance for all industry. We should 
encourage the development of communities 
which can be seen as real “Living Labs” 
involving all research actors needed for high 
level research that has high impact for 
national growth. 
Thus, an issue that is critical to the success of 
GSM as a mobile communication 
infrastructure and remains critical for the 
deployment of high-speed mobile data 
services is interoperability . 
 
In a converging environment, new challenges 
to achieving interoperability emerge. This is 
because new systems and services are 
developed with inputs from multiple 
industries, including telecoms, broadcasting, Poor service 
delivery 
Bad GSM 
infrastructure   
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 222  
 internet, computer and media industries. Each 
of these industries will have different 
perspectives onStandardization and 
interoperability. 
 
Interoperability is critical to mass market 
take-up of new services. Commercial 
dynamics are the primary drivers towards 
achieving appropriate interoperability. 
Regulatory intervention must always be a last 
resort. While there is much ongoing work on 
interoperability, Industry needs to take real 
steps towards interoperability as a matter of 
urgency. 
 
The deployment of content applications over 
mobile is also fundamental for the mobile 
communications and content industries and is 
an essential part of the new data paradigm. 
The success of new business models is a key 
factor in the sustainability of the market. To 
this end the industry should pursue its efforts 
in open application interface development. 
 
The availability of a clear and predictable 
regulatory environment like the NCC can 
facilitate the creation of, and investment in, 
new products and services. The enforcement 
of intellectual property rights and the creation 
of a secure environment for content are 
crucial for the development of richer services. 
Effective enforcement of rights can be 
supported through technical protection 
measures and Digital Rights 
Management technologies. These can help 
prevent unauthorized use of protected 
content while enabling new business models 
to flourish. 
 
7.0     Recommendations 
 
First, the emergence of high speed data 
services will include corporate and consumer 
applications involving personal and sensitive 
data. For these transactions, a trusted and 
secure identification and authentication 
process is needed. Mobile communication-
based authentication is well placed to serve as a basis. It is already assisted by the universal 
availability of GSM networks and terminals 
across Nigeria. The industry should agree a 
common interoperable authentication 
framework that will ensure general purpose 
authentication uses across Nigeria. 
 
The second issue is mobile payments . There 
is at present considerable uncertainty 
regarding the application of international 
rules on e-money and money laundering to 
mobile payment services. Any over-regulation 
of these services threatens the continuing 
viability of mobile content services. The NCC 
should work hard to ensure that appropriate 
rules are put in place for the new mobile 
payment segment. 
 
The third issue is the continued existence of 
regulatory and quasi-regulatory barriers to 
the establishment of new base stations and 
masts in some localities. Unless the 
stakeholder or operators particularly unite 
around the NCC Recommendation, there is a 
risk that the imposition of stricter electro-
magnetic limits than those recommended by 
NCC could represent a continuous barrier for 
network deployment like 3G and above. 
Conclusion  
There are grounds for greater optimism for 
the mobile communication sector. There are 
signs of improvement. Over the past year, 
Nigerian mobile operators have launched 
been trying to launch better backbones with 
better and expanded bandwidths like 3G and 
above. The growth of high-speed mobile data 
services is an exciting opportunity. If grasped, 
we will realize enormous social and economic 
benefits – not least through significant gains 
in productivity. A focus on services and 
innovative applications will drive the 
development of the mobile communications 
sector forward. 
 
Furthermore, Nigeria’s power sector reform 
initiative which was launched in 2005  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 223  
 recognizes the need to improve power sector 
performance as a critical step in its efforts to 
address development challenges. Through the 
2010 Roadmap, Nigeria revitalized the 
challenging process of implementing reforms 
by outlining the government’s strategy and 
actions to undertake comprehensive power 
sector reform to expand supply, open the door 
to private investment, and address some of 
the chronic sector issues hampering 
improvement of service delivery.  
 
We know that power supply is one of the 
many challenges Nigeria is expected to 
address to ensure that the country is on course to meet the MDGs, particularly those 
related to health. Increased power supply will 
strengthen, among other things, mobile 
communication information systems of which 
the GSM is part. 
We hope that the Nigerian Government, the 
mobile network companies, and the 
international community at large will 
consolidate their efforts in addressing the 
mobile  
Network coverage and power supply 
challenges in order to create an enabling 
environment for socio-economic development 
particularly in rural and disadvantaged areas.

Abstract 
The focus of this paper is to design an e-managemen t of patient record for accurate management which 
centers on easy storage and retrieval of patients’ information in the hospitals. The e-health system 
provides security with an encryption security techn ique so as to protect patient’s data, and a system that 
can eliminate delays (time) associated with manual processing of document in the health organization. 
The research was carried out due to of the problems  militating accurate data management and retrieval 
in the health sector which include: delay in diagno sis of illness by doctors due to lack of modern 
equipment, wrong drug prescription and treatment of  patients, data loss within the health sector due t o 
poor record management, poor data integrity and red undancy, lack of security of data/file. The 
methodology adopted was structured system analysis and design (SSADM) while the implementation 
software used was HTML, PHP,CSS and MySQL. The outp ut was an e-management of patients’ record 
system that enable health practitioners and organiz ations effectively manage patient’s records and als o 
enable the patients to check for health information , and book appointment with doctor electronically 
from a remote area. It is an effective means of ens uring accurate data protection, storage, quick 
recovery and easy management of patients’ records wi thin the health sector.

1. Introduction  
 
The prompt improvements in information 
technology and internet have motivated business 
organizations to start thinking of making the 
completest possible use of modern systems in all 
types of businesses and activities. E-management 
is one of the most important modern systems, 
which is considered a modern ticket to develop 
and update business methods and procedures [1] 
The fillings of the administrative process, like 
planning, organization, control, coordination, and 
decision-making, have no slower been performed 
in the traditional paper form, but automatically, 
which increased productivity, simplified work 
procedure and provided services that exceed user's 
expectations, and increase effective decisions [2].  
Meanwhile the huge technological uprising, 
including e-management has become must to 
upgrade the anticipated administrative reform. We 
have nothing to do in the future without such 
developments. All organizations must redesign 
the managerial organization so that it is able to 
keep pace with the technological developments 
and effectively deal with the changes 
knowledgeable by the present era [3] Thus, organizations have continued to use e-
management in all administrative processes, like 
planning, organization, coordination, direction 
and control. Enhancement of efficient 
productivity requires effective management that 
organizes their activities and coordinates their 
efforts to achieve the desired goals and convert 
documentary paper work into automated work, 
which is called an electronic work, or paperless 
management [4] Hence, this study attempts to 
showcase how e-management could be 
implemented in health sector for easy and faster 
decision making. 
2. Literature Review 
The Concept of Electronic Management 
Electronic management can be concise as an 
administrative process that depends on the 
opportunities of the Internet and business 
networks in the planning, direction and control of 
innovative resources in order to achieve the goals 
of the organization [5]. Moreover [5] also defined 
Electronic management as a planned approach for 
the management of the future and dynamic 
organizations by implementing high enactment  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 226  
 system based on technology. The electronic 
management focusing on incorporation, 
computerization and artificial intelligence through  
the use of the rapid development of system for 
achieving the vision of the organization as seen by 
[6]. Electronic Management is the sunshade for 
many of the e-business models. 
These also include electronic management tools 
for information exchange and cooperation 
amongst the various parties to the supply chain. 
The electronic management comprises processes 
that ensure compatibility of the managerial 
functions and IT departments with each other and 
be able to provide services and the availability of  
security, and good performance for the 
achievement of e-business [7]. 
Based on the foregoing, it is clear that the 
Electronic Management depend on on confusion 
between information and communication 
technology to do all the operations of the special 
administrative institutions in order to improve 
performance and enhance competitiveness. 
Benefits of E-Management System 
[8] stated that the great attention given by the 
developed world using information technology 
and its various components caused by the 
importance and the significant benefits offered by 
the latter, so countries started compete in applyin g 
electronic management in view of the benefits 
achieved. The following are the most important 
benefits of electronic administration. 
The electronic systems can be capable to express 
and recognize correctly the costs, and they have 
the ability to track and record sales. We can also 
make all these advantages in traditional systems 
according to [9]. The key philosophy or view of 
the electronic management to the administration is 
as a basis of services, citizens and companies as 
clients or customers want to take advantage of 
these services, so the electronic management has 
many goals sought to be achieved in the 
framework of its dealings with the client, 
including: 
1. Streamline procedures and reduce costs and 
give more quality service. 
2. Curtail the implementation time of an 
administrative transaction. 
3. Correctness and objectivity in the process 
carried out. 4. Fasten communication between the various 
enterprise departments and with other institutions 
within and outside the country of the institution. 
5. Decrease the use of paper is significantly 
impacting positively on the work of the 
Foundation. 
6. Shrink the use of paper, addresses the problem 
of saving and documentation of Transactions. 
 The Importance of Electronic Management 
The automated management is a significant jump 
from the conventional methods in public 
administration, this means the distribution of 
government services and information using 
electronic means. E-government has brought 
about a revolution in the quality of services 
provided and the most important is transparency 
in the administration i.e. to provide timely 
delivery of services, simplification of procedures,  
and reduction of [8]. 
According to [11] and in the opinion of [12], the 
electronic management is not very difficult, but in  
the coming years the electronic management will 
become a requirement for companies that wish to 
enter the race, and it will be something imposed 
on them by competitors. It is also crucial that 
companies be aware of their need for electronic 
management. 
3. Review of Related literature 
 Health Information Systems 
Progress in information technology is a real and 
unavoidable fact; it plays an important role in the  
healthcare sector regarding its final goal in healt h 
care. In this sector, the scope of action covers 
various areas such as the Health Information 
Systems, Telemedicine, Biological Signal 
Processing (in which is included the Medical 
Image Processing), Security Health Informatics, 
etc. 
Information and Communication Technologies 
increased use in healthcare organizations presents 
a pattern that is similar to what happened in major  
companies that rely in a well-developed IT 
infrastructure. The use of web technologies, 
database systems, and network infrastructures are 
some initiatives that affect both the practice and 
management of healthcare market. 
On the subject of the evolution of information and 
communication technologies in healthcare 
organizations, there is a strong resistance to the 
adoption of e-health systems the use of the so-
called Electronic Medical Records (EMR). With  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 227  
 the use of patient data information systems, 
information goes from a paper record to electronic 
format in the form of files, thus allowing easier 
and more effective management. However, it is 
interesting to note the tendency of users to learn 
and actively participate in the promotion, 
prevention and health care, along with the rights 
and authorized standards have a real impact in the 
development of the information systems, which 
take these factors into account. 
The idea of Health Information System arises 
from Health Information and Communication 
Technologies, establishing one of the three main 
lines along which they are systematized [13]. 
Health Information Systems are frequently 
described as the communication between 
individuals, processes and technology in order to 
support fundamental information operations, 
management and availability, so that healthcare 
services can be improved [14]. Similarly to other 
sectors, the nature of the health sector has 
changed over time from a relatively stable activity  
to a dynamic backdrop. Health Information 
Systems, whose evolution is based on several 
different technologies, can be described as those 
who, through data processing, provide 
information and enhance the knowledge formation 
in health care environments [15]. Giving more 
features to this definition we can say that an 
Health Information System can be defined as a 
mechanism for storing, processing, analyzing and 
transmitting information required for planning, 
organization, execution and evaluation of health 
services. 
The main goal of Health Information Systems is 
to contribute to an efficient and high quality 
healthcare [14]. These systems should also 
promote the development, justification and 
improvement of its management. So that these 
objectives can be achieved, Health Information 
Systems must fulfill interoperability standards, 
quality, security, scalability, reliability and 
timeliness in data storage and processing terms 
[13]. They should ensure efficiency and security 
of information flows, eliminating actions 
duplication, namely diagnoses, and 
simultaneously enhance the speed, efficiency and 
proximity of health systems. Also note that these 
systems should have not only clinical features, as 
well as management ones, which should be linked through the integration of different information 
systems used, allowing: 
Right of entry to data needed for performance 
monitoring and correlation of the ones needed for 
economic evaluation studies; 
Case-mix consolidation and data mining to 
support the provider’s procurement; health 
planning; 
Better accountability, better decision-making and 
evidence-based policies; 
Reorganization of logistics and supply flows. 
There are rising needs for information at point of 
care, intended to be complete, homogeneous, 
accurate, and current and of interest to clinical 
decision [16].  Several studies show that 
information systems can result a positive effect on  
excellence of care [17], as well as being presently  
unquestionable their potential economic profits 
[18]. 
Electronic Health Record  
The health record is an active informational entity  
that allows uninterrupted monitoring of the health 
ailment of a patient, which totals all the 
information from the clinical history and 
treatments, to the considerations and findings 
resulting from additional performed diagnostic 
tests. It is understood by Electronic Health Record  
(EHR) of a patient the chronological 
agglomeration of clinical information resulting 
from the care the patient received, cataloged by 
place of performance and professionals engaged 
in the provided acts. 
Moreover permitting better information 
management and flexibility when related to paper 
records, these systems existing as great advantage 
the quickly access to useful information desirable 
for decision-making at the point of care [19]. 
Beyond these, we can also highlight other 
advantages such as its ability to allow concurrent 
discussion and edition of the information relating 
to a patient by different health experts, space 
savings over the growing number of clinical 
registers, the data security and confidentiality 
promotion, the integration of different information  
resources (complementary diagnostic tests results 
(laboratory tests, medical images, etc..), 
centralization and constantly updated information, 
the information structuring according to medical 
standards and the promotion of statistical control 
and optimization services [20], [21].  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 228  
 Notwithstanding the numerous benefits of EHR 
adoption, reality illustrates a low rate of 
implementation of these systems [22], being the 
main causes the large initial investment and 
maintenance costs, the privacy and trust of 
potential users, the interoperability, the migratio n 
of old records, and social organizational and legal  
barriers [21]. 
Electronic Record Management Systems 
Electronic Record Management Systems (ERMS) 
is a dominant management and storage system for 
medical records that bump into the legal 
requirements of an organization by retaining all 
the important records. ERMS records document 
and supports the working, performance, and 
administrative activities of hospitals.  ERMS 
manages these records for electronic storage and 
retrieval by approved staff of a hospital, allows 
removal of paper file copies, and prevents their 
unintentional destruction. 
[23], stated that in the establishment, there was 
only hand written charts were time consuming and 
boring. Scrawled handwritten charts not only took 
lot of time to undertaking and interpret but also t o 
more serious problems such as errors in 
diagnoses, treatment, and billing. 
Advantages, Disadvantages and Problems 
Implementing EMRS 
Nowadays EMR systems are widely used in 
hospitals, nursing facilities, healthcare, clinics,  
laboratory facilities, treatment centers, and 
physicians’ offices. The advantages of EMRS as 
stated by [24] include: 
1. Suitability of use. 
2. Distant access 
3. Information is more organized and easier 
to read compared to paper records. 
4. Concurrent access to multiple users. 
5. Enhanced efficiency of processes such as 
data collection, data management and data 
retrieval 
The disadvantages of EMRS are: 
1. High initial investment. 
2. Every error on the record can have a major 
impact due to multiple people accessing to the 
same record at the same time. 
3. Failures in hardware or software can result 
in loss of information. 
Impact of EMRS on Healthcare Industry 
Definitely there is no doubts that most of the 
hospitals do not have a complete paperless EMRS still from the admission of the patient till the 
release many procedures have already been 
automated. Numerous administrative departments 
(billing, financial management and 
conceptualizing of medical records) of healthcare 
providers are being computerized besides, areas 
like laboratory tests, radiology reports, issuing o f 
medical certificates. Simulated Medical Worlds 
had noticed that computer-based ERMS have 
modernized the automation of workflow and 
greatly reduced the usage of paper up to 75 per 
cent [25]. 
Omtool, a prominent document and information 
handling solutions provider for managing the 
lifecycle of medical records highlighted that the 
existence of EMR must be in the format that all 
required users must be able to portion information 
timely [26]. Although, EMRS is able to provide 
instant entrance to the information of the patients , 
privacy is also one of the factors that must be 
taken into thoughtfulness. The U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services had introduced a 
privacy rule under the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act [27]. The 
purpose of the act is to protect and safeguards the  
information of the patients either physically or 
technically. Due to the reliance on EMR, Business 
Continuity Plan (BCP) is then developed vital to 
all healthcare organizations from disaster strikes.  
Hence, proper possibility plan must be provided 
for all healthcare workers in case of any disaster 
so that normal procedures could be resumed 
within a stipulated time frame as information of 
patient is personal. Consequently, healthcare 
providers should plan for keeping “back-ups” in a 
secured offsite location. As paper records are 
volatile and prone to destruction, many healthcare 
providers should consider to digitize their paper 
records so that they could be accessed 
automatically in the event of any catastrophe. 
4.  Methodology Adopted  
In this research, Structured System Analysis and 
Design (SSADM) was deployed and it is 
encapsulated as follows: 
Problem Identification  
Problem identification has been the major aspect 
when problem solving is to be achieved, in this 
research, it was identified that the rate at which 
delay of managerial activities are done at various 
levels in our hospitals are quit alarming.   Becaus e 
of the manual form of storing patients records are  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 229  
 hence prone to a lot of errors (mistakes).  As 
stated in the statement of problem of this work, 
the outlined problems was identified and which 
serves as the major motivation for the researcher 
to embark on this work.  
Feasibility Study 
This is the process of making enquiries of what it 
will cost to develop a system or software. In this 
research, feasibility study was applied to know if 
the project is feasible, by investigating the goals  
and implications of the project. During the course 
of feasibility study, four main areas came into 
consideration and these areas helped in answering 
some vital questions like:  
Technical – is the project technically possible? 
Financial – can the business afford to carry out the  
project? 
Organizational – will the new system be 
compatible with existing practices? 
Ethical – is the impact of the new system socially 
acceptable? 
Analysis 
System analysis is a process of investigating, 
analysis, design, installation and evaluation of 
information system either for change or 
modernization. A proper research was done on the 
current system in use, to know the challenges it 
faces and also to know how to upgrade the new 
system to tackle all those challenges in future to 
avoid reoccurrence of those challenges. There 
were some data collection methods that were used 
during the course of this research and they 
include: observation, interviews and 
questionnaire. 
Observation: Is a systematic approach of studying 
and making accurate records of the system of 
operation and other operational activities in a 
scene and organization, watching how managers 
make decision, store patient’s records was done 
by the Imo Specialist hospital Owerri Umuguma. 
Through this means, accurate data was collected 
and flow of managerial operation within the 
organization. 
Interview: It gives more accurate information 
about system organization. It is a conversation 
where questions are asked and answers are given. 
It is a one-on-one conversation with one person 
acting in the role of the interviewer and the other  
in the role of the interviewee. The interviewer 
asks mostly various means of storing patients record, method of drug dispensing and adding of 
new staff record and the interviewee responds. 
Questionnaire: this is a research instrument 
consisting of a series of question (or other type o f 
prompts) for the purpose of gathering information 
from respondents. 
Internet: The internet played a very important role  
in data collection and process of the existing 
system operation. 
 
4. System Design:  
This is a representation of all the steps followed in 
developing the new system. It includes 
flowcharts, high-level model diagrams etc. 
The design phase will be done in chapter four of 
this work where all the conceptual designs will be 
done such as input and output design, database 
design, high level model of the proposed system, 
data flow diagram of the proposed system etc. 
5. Program Coding:  
After representing all the steps to be followed in 
developing the new system, codes are then used to 
convert this step by step approach of the design 
into a computer program following step by step 
approach (algorithm). The coding will be done 
with HTML, PHP, CSS and MySQL. 
6. Program Testing:  
This deals with the testing of the new system that 
has been designed so as to correct any deficiency 
before it is put into full operation. Here script a nd 
evaluation test will be conducted on every module 
and sub-module of the designed system so as to 
ensure durability and satisfaction of the aim.  
7. System Implementation: 
 This has to do with putting the system into use 
after translating the detailed design into codes. A t 
this point, all the specifications must have been 
met and the users of the software or the 
organization that will make use of the software 
are satisfied with the design. The hardware and 
software implementation are discussed and 
handover procedures as well as training and 
retraining of the staffs and users of the system. 
8. Program Maintenance:  
Program maintenance is designed to keep 
programs in working condition, error free, and up-
to-date adjustment, replacement, repairs 
5. Advantages of the New System  
The proposed system has the following 
advantages:  
West African Journal of Industrial and Academic Research  vol.19 No2. April 2018                 230  
 • The system will give the organization a good 
and secured storage medium to keep patients 
record electronically.  
• Promote file integrity, reduce redundancy and 
encourage use of ICT in the health sector. 
• It will save time and money and life of patients 
• It will Enhance and speed up treatment and 
decision taken 
• It will give assurance and confidence to both pat ients 
and health practitioners in discharging their 
duties. 
• It will serve as a centralized system for quick 
information processing, storing and sharing within 
the organization. 
6.  System Design and Implementations 
System design deals with putting solutions to the 
problems with the available resources. It is the blue print of the system that is to be developed. 
Therefore, software life cycle requires some basic 
activities which include:  
i. Decomposition of the entire system into 
components: Identification of the system 
architecture including various menu and screen 
displays, how the system can be installed, the 
hardware and software 
specifications/requirements for the installation of  
the system and how to start up the system. 
ii. Component of the proposed system and their 
relationship as well as its dependencies are 
covered. 
iii. Inter component communication mechanism are 
also achieved.

. System Description  
The program was designed using Top – Down 
Approach. It makes use of the fundamental 
problem solving techniques. The software is 
structured in such a way that each subsystem is 
selected and executed independently. The task is 
divided into several modules, which come 
together to give the solution to the problem. The 
modules are as follows: a) User’s Module: The user’s module is designed 
to enable user login and either update account or 
place appointment to see the doctor. 
b) Admin Dash-Board: The admin uses this 
module to create new users, maintain the entire 
database and as well view other information. 
This module can also enable administrator to 
view patients account reports, doctors’ 
information, as well as delete or upload any Patient Admin  Doctor

c) Doctors Dash-Board: This module serves as an 
a module where they can view or check for 
appointments from patients and also to update 
their profile, create new employed doctors/ 
Nurses..  
d) Patients Dash-Board: This module connects all 
the activities the patients could manage such as 
placing of medical appointment to see doctor, 
updating of accounts and payments. 
e) View Manage Patients Information Module: 
This module is used by the administrator to 
record and view all patients recorded medical 
information and history including drug 
dispensing and drug reactions.  
f) View Manage Doctors Module: This module 
allow the administrator to check all registered 
doctors. 
g) Payment Module: This module is use to make 
payment for any purchase or hospital bills 
charged by patients in the hospital. 
h) Manage Record:  This module is enabling the 
administrator of the proposed system to edit, 
delete, upload, record or patients information 
inside the database.   
i) Print Receipt Module:  This is a link in which 
patient could download bill payment receipt 
after payment.  
8. Choice and Justification of Programming 
Language Platform So many programming languages were 
considered in the cause of designing this 
software. A lot of factors were put into 
consideration which includes online database 
access, data transmission via networks, database 
security, database retrieval online, multi user 
network access, online data capture, etc. 
 
Front-End Development  
The front end development which was the link 
(interface) between the users of the system and 
the back-end of the application was designed 
with Hypertext Markup language (HTML), 
Cascading Style  
Sheet (CSS), and Java-script. Where the 
JavaScript provide the adequate interaction and 
events of action between the application and the 
end users. The look and feel was amended with 
sharp colors and styling with the Cascading 
style sheet (CSS). 
Back-End Development 
The back end development which ensures that 
any request made from the front-end was 
serviced accordingly was designed with 
Hypertext Preprocessor (Php), and My-
Structural Query Language (MySQL). 
8.Experiment and Discussion
