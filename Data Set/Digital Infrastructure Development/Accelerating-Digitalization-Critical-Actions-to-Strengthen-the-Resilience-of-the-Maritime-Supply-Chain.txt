ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION8CYBERSECURITY
Cybersecurity encompasses the capability to protect or defend against unautho -
rized access to or use of cyberspace from cyberattacks. Cybersecurity includes 
the collective measures implemented to defend a computer or computer-en -
abled system against cyber-enabled threats, such as hackers, hacktivists, foreign 
intelligence services, and organized criminal syndicates, among others.
DIGITAL HEALTH SECURITY
Digital health security involves the digital capability to protect workers at sites 
of critical infrastructure. Digital health security consists of the necessary digital 
measures to ensure business continuity and protect port workers from potential 
infection during the COVID-19 pandemic such as enforcing social distancing and 
temperature control of port workers.
DIGITAL PORT SECURITY 
Digital port security involves the digital capability to protect ports as critical infra -
structure vital to economy and security. Digital port security consists of the need 
for global control of assets, goods, and people through digital technologies.
PORT CALL OPTIMIZATION (PCO)
Port call optimization, or PCO, is about optimizing speed, draught, and port stay, 
leading to lower costs, cleaner environment, more reliability, and safety for ship -
ping, terminals and ports.
MARITIME SINGLE WINDOW (MSW)
A maritime single window, or MSW, is a one-stop service environment that covers 
maritime and port administrative procedures, such as port entry and departure 
declaration, notice of security reports, and other related information between 
private sectors and public authorities in the port. In other words, an MSW is a 
single window in the scope of maritime and port fields, and would exclude the 
interactions related to the clearance of the consignment itself.
PORT COMMUNITY SYSTEM (PCS)
A port community system, or PCS, is a neutral and open electronic platform 
enabling intelligent and secure exchange of information between public and pri -
vate stakeholders in order to improve the competitive position of the sea and air 
ports’ communities. The PCS is intended to optimize, manage, and automate port 
and logistics processes through a single submission of data and by connecting 
transport and logistics chains.GlossaryCRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN9PORT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (PMS)
A port management system, or PMS, enables the port authority to control 
traffic and manage port infrastructure, such as port calls, dues, journal, 
incidents, waste, dangerous goods, planner, cargo, inspections, permits, 
services, security, and assets.
SINGLE WINDOW
In the annex to the Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime 
Traffic (the FAL Convention), a single window, is defined as a facility that 
allows submission of standardized information covered by the convention to 
a single-entry point. The facility is generally understood to be based on elec -
tronic data transmission and relies on system software to distribute the data 
submitted to the receivers in accordance with the system rules and user 
agreements. The literal definition of single window allows for any type of 
data transmission that employs a single-entry point and avoids duplication.
United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Recommenda -
tion No.331 defines a “single window” as an electronic facility providing trade 
facilitation measures that allows parties involved in trade and transport to 
lodge standardized information and documents with a single-entry point to 
fulfil all import, export, and transit-related regulatory requirements. Individ -
ual data elements should only be submitted once electronically.
SMART PORT
A smart port is an automated port that uses nascent technologies such as 
big data, internet of things (IoT), blockchain solutions, and other smart tech -
nology-based methods to improve performance and economic competitive -
ness. With these technologies, smart ports can also improve environmental 
sustainability. In an ideal smart port, processes would be automated and 
connected via IoT.
TERMINAL OPERATING SYSTEM (TOS)
Employed in maritime, waterway, rail-to-rail, and intermodal rail terminal 
operations, a terminal operating system, or TOS, provides visibility, control, 
optimization, scheduling, planning, analytics, and automated handling of 
maritime containers, rail containers, and break bulk.
VESSEL TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (VTMIS)
A vessel traffic management information system, or VTMIS, integrates and 
interconnects all the relevant assets to manage maritime operations safely 
and securely. This includes management of maritime operations from 
marine environmental protection to traffic management, law enforcement, 
and security at sea.NOTE

ForewordsCRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN11
I am very pleased to introduce this transport-focused technical 
report on “accelerating digitalization,” conceived as a follow-up to 
a policy statement issued in early June 2020—in the wake of the 
COVID-19 pandemic—by a number of port and maritime industry 
organizations. In that original statement, the signatories jointly 
called upon international and intergovernmental organizations, gov -
ernments and industry stakeholders concerned with maritime trade 
and logistics to come together and accelerate the pace of digitali -
zation so that port communities across the world can at minimum 
offer a basic package of electronic commerce and data exchange. 
The statement listed nine priority areas, ranging from port call 
optimization to cybersecurity, and was endorsed by the secretary 
general of the International Maritime Organization.
The COVID-19 crisis has emphasized the critical role of seaports in keeping supply chains moving and econo -
mies functioning across the world. A great variety of business and government actors interact in port com -
munities to ensure multimodal flows of vital medical and food supplies, critical agricultural products, energy 
streams, and other goods and services reach their intended destinations in time. Their interactions comprise 
physical interactions, such as cargo handling operations, vessel-related services, and multimodal transfers, 
along with exchanges of data that facilitate clearance of cargo between jurisdictions.
When it comes to digitalization, the COVID-19 crisis has painfully demonstrated the heterogeneous landscape 
that currently exists across ports worldwide. While some port communities have seized the opportunities 
found in the Fourth Industrial Revolution and have developed into full-fledged “smart” ports, many others have 
barely grasped the essentials of digitalization and continue to struggle with larger reliance on personal inter -
action and paper-based transactions as the norms for shipboard, ship-to-shore interface, and shore-to-hinter -
land based exchanges.
In producing this report, the authors reveal a keen willingness to action the message of the initial policy state -
ment in practice, outlining in concrete terms short- and medium-term measures to accelerate digitalization 
that will improve resilience and efficiency in port communities around the world. The report is also intended 
to facilitate the necessary policy reform in these areas, as digitalization is not just a matter of technology but, 
more importantly, of change management, data collaboration, and political commitment.
I am most grateful to the team at the World Bank and every port expert who contributed to this paper. 
Although a wonderful example of a collaborative effort between industry partners, its timely conception is in 
no small part due to the efforts of long-standing IAPH member Pascal Ollivier, president of Maritime Street, 
an authority in the field of digital trade logistics. The relentless enthusiasm and energy of Pascal ensured that 
this insightful report was produced in a record time of just two months. It can now start its journey around the 
world and pave the way for the next stages in our global effort to help the port and maritime industry embrace 
the digital era.

ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION12
The World Development Report 2016: Digital Dividends 
underlined how digital technology creates opportunities 
to accelerate growth, generate jobs, and improve services. 
However, in some sectors these opportunities are often 
missed, or at the very least delayed, because firms and 
public authorities are either protected from innovation, 
or face real barriers to implementation in the form of insti-
tutional or regulatory obstacles, and insufficient human 
capital or resources to implement the changes. The risks 
facing these sectors and countries include slower eco -
nomic growth, lower employment, poorer services, and 
higher trade costs.
The digital revolution has emerged in the past decade as one of the main drivers of change in 
the port and maritime sector, promoting a high level of integration between devices, agents, and 
activities. Together with the increased connectivity between ports, it has created a new ecosystem 
in the industry—one where being on the outside presents a significant disadvantage for ports and 
countries. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has underlined the importance of these changes, with one of the early 
lessons being the need to ensure business continuity and improving the resilience of critical supply 
lines, such as the maritime gateways and associated logistical chains. Maritime transport carries 90 
percent of the global merchandise trade, and impediments to ports’ logistical chains will have tangi -
ble repercussions for port hinterlands and their populations. In the short term, these impediments 
will likely drive shortages of essential goods and higher prices; in the medium to longer term, they 
could result in slower economic growth, lower employment, and higher trade costs.
However, growing digital integration is not without risk: Cybersecurity is now one of the major chal -
lenges facing the maritime industry. Policymakers need to work with the private sector to ensure 
critical infrastructure is adequately protected, while continuing to help achieve the full benefits of 
new technologies in a sector where the digital transition has been uneven across countries.
This World Bank technical report, produced in collaboration with the International Association of 
Ports and Harbors, the World Ports Sustainability Program, and their members, is both timely and 
welcome and will hopefully stimulate a dialogue among key stakeholders and move this essential 
agenda forward. Digital technologies will enable the competitive business environments, increased 
accountability, and better education and skills-development systems that will create the maritime 
jobs of the future. The World Bank Group stands ready to help countries pursue these priorities.

CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN13
Executive SummaryACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION141. The COVID-19 pandemic has upended lives and brought major 
disruption to economic activity across the world, precipitating an 
unprecedented global health and economic crisis.  Although too early 
for a full assessment of the impact of the pandemic, it is clear that 
COVID-19 has brought severe hardship, especially to landlocked and 
least developed countries, and poor and vulnerable communities. 
The challenges include inter alia (Latin for “among other things”) food 
insecurity, lack of medical supplies, loss of income and livelihood, diffi -
culties in applying sanitary and physical distancing measures, a loom -
ing debt crisis as well as related political and security risks. Vulnerable 
sectors (for example, tourism, the oil and gas industry, maritime, air 
and road transport, freight forwarding, logistics, and wholesale and 
retail sectors) were hit especially hard; some might not recover.
2. One of the key lessons learned early in the pandemic was the 
need to ensure business continuity of the critical supply lines, nota -
bly the maritime gateways, and the associated logistical chains.  
Maritime transport carries 90 percent of all merchandise trade, and 
as such any impediment to the maritime logistical chains, results in 
tangible repercussions for countries served by the port, and their 
respective populations. While to a greater or lesser extent, the initial 
challenge has been met and overcome in some countries, experience 
so far and the risk of subsequent waves underlines the urgent need 
to improve the resilience of the maritime sector, through accelerating 
the digitalization of maritime trade and logistics, which will automate 
trading across borders and reduce traditional human interaction and 
paper-based transactions.
3. However, the maritime ports are also just one node in a complex 
logistical chain involving a number of interactions; digitization is 
vital to improving the competitiveness of that chain.  The digital rev -
olution has emerged in the past decade as one of the main drivers of 
change in the port and maritime sector, and requires a high level of 
integration between devices, agents, and activities. This, together with 
the increased connectivity between ports, has created a new ecosys -
tem in the industry—one where being on the outside is a significant 
disadvantage for ports and countries. It is vital that maritime ports 
improve their position in respect of technological innovation and 
integration, both to ensure or improve their competitiveness, but also 
to reduce the cost of international trade for their respective hosts 
and hinterland. Because maritime transport carries 90 percent of The digital revolution

have tangible repercussions. In the short term, these impediments 
will likely drive shortages of essential goods and higher prices; in the 
medium to longer term, they could result in slower economic growth, 
lower employment, and higher trade costs.
4. A number of global organizations, such as UNCTAD, UNECE, 
WCO, WTO, and IMO have been advocating the accelerated digitali -
zation of cross-border processes and documentation.  The objectives 
have been to not only keep trade flowing in current and future events, 
but also protect frontline workers at sea and on land while enabling 
remote working, with contactless electronic solutions replacing paper 
documents. Unfortunately, as of November 2020, only 49 of the 174 
member states of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) pos -
sess functioning port community systems (PCSs)—with higher income 
countries making up the majority of those that do have port com -
munity systems in place. The delay in introduction poses a risk to the 
business continuity during subsequent waves of the pandemic, along 
with a further risk over a slightly longer period, which would result 
from the development of a two-tier system, with laggards facing 
increased costs for the import and export of merchandise trade.
5. This report highlights the immediate, short-, and medium-term 
measures considered necessary to strengthen the resilience of the 
maritime and logistics sector, to build back better, and more impor -
tantly ensure countries realize the significant potential efficiency 
gains of digitization. Figure E.1 provides a schematic of the proposed 
road map and approximate timeline toward improving the digitization 
of the maritime logistic chain for any country. The figure illustrates 
the necessary immediate, short-, and medium-term measures, and a 
generic timeline for their introduction. The road map encompasses 
the emergency measures on digital health security monitoring and 
the establishment of an intergovernmental agencies crisis manage -
ment center to protect crews, port workers, and passengers from 
cruises and ferries in the “new normal” by enforcing social distancing 
and temperature control of port workers.The objectives have

6. The immediate measures are followed by, but could also be 
in parallel to, the short-term measures to meet the mandatory 
requirements, as defined in the IMO’s Facilitation (FAL) Convention 
(IMO 1965).  The FAL Convention seeks to support transmission, 
receipt, and response of information required making the transition 
to full-fledged maritime single windows (MSWs), for example: the 
arrival, stay, and departure of ships, persons, and cargo via electronic 
data exchange (see figure E.2). This has been a mandatory require -
ment for all ports since April 2019, though implementation remains 
partial at best. The International Association of Ports and Harbors 
(IAPH) has just launched a survey to ascertain the current status of 
implementation.CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN17Figure E.2. Maritime Single Window
7. However, the standards and data elements need to be harmo -
nized to facilitate the exchange of information ship to port and the 
interoperability of the electronic systems. The need for harmonized 
maritime-related data and common agreed standards led to the 
development of the IMO Compendium on Facilitation and Electronic 
Business. 1 The IMO Compendium is a tool for software developers 
who design the systems needed to support transmission, receipt, and 
response via electronic exchange, of information required for arrival, 
stay and departure of ships, persons, and cargo to or from a port. It 
consists of an IMO data set and IMO reference data model 2 agreed 
by the main organizations involved in the development of standards 
for the electronic exchange of maritime-related information linked to 
the FAL Convention.
8. The IMO Compendium is intended to facilitate the ship-to-port 
exchange of information and the interoperability of single win -
dows—a key requirement—thereby reducing the administrative 
burden for ships linked to formalities and ports.  The IMO Compen -
dium is not conceived to create “new” standards, but rather as a tool 
to harmonize existing standards and produce guidance for interested 
parties to automatically map the IMO data set to any of the leading 
standards and enable companies involved in maritime trade or trans -
port to create software that can communicate no matter the standard 
on which they are based.NOTES

 9. In parallel to the need for ports to meet the FAL Convention 
requirements, ports also need to initiate the discussion on the nine 
key data elements related to port call optimization. The objective 
of the latter is to allow ships to optimize speed during the voyage 
to facilitate a timely arrival at the pilot boarding place, thus securing 
berths, fairways, and nautical services at the destination ports. This 
just-in-time (JIT) arrival will also increase port competitiveness.
10.  Equally important, ports must commence the establishment 
and introduction of a port community system.  The PCS is a vital plat -
form to optimize, manage, and automate port and logistics processes 
through a single submission of data in the transport and logistics 
chain. The coherence between PCS, port management system (PMS), 
and MSW 3 should be ensured in order that the maritime and trade 
logistics actors can benefit from the digitalization of these processes 
and associated applications, and that those benefits are realized in a 
country’s international trade costs (figure E.3). 
CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN1911.  In the medium term, every port needs to upgrade to a PMS in 
order to ensure the full digitalization of all processes related to traf -
fic control and assets management. As illustrated in figure E.4, a PMS 
enables the port authority to control all port traffic through a single 
digital interface, and manage port infrastructure such as port calls, 
dues, journal, incidents, waste, dangerous goods, planner, cargo, 
inspections, permits, services, security, and assets. 
Figure E.4. Port Management System
12.  The last medium-term measure reflects the need for a discus -
sion that will facilitate the movement to the next generation PMS, 
intended to prepare the transition from cargo hub to digital hub 
through the smart port concept. The latter is defined as an automat -
ed port that uses nascent technologies such as artificial intelligence, 
advanced analytics, internet of things (IoT), fifth-generation technol -
ogy (5G), autonomous systems, digital twin, blockchain and other 
distributed ledger solutions as well as other smart technology-based 
methods to improve performance, economic competitiveness, and 
environmental sustainability. In an ideal smart port, all processes 
would be automated and connected via the IoT.ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION2013.  But increasing the digitization of the maritime logistical chain, 
while essential, also brings new risks: Between February and May 
2020, cyberattacks increased 400 percent in the maritime industry 
(Captive International 2020) . In 2017, global container shipping com -
pany Maersk and its international port operation wing overcame an 
aggressive cyberattack—which served as a serious wake-up call. Oth -
er attacks have followed and we can be sure that there will be more 
to come. The risk of a cyberattack has become the top risk for port 
authorities and the wider port community of stakeholders, neces -
sitating improved cybersecurity at the port community ecosystem 
level. This report discusses the risks, how a port community should 
approach mitigating these risks, and provides two such illustrations 
from the Port of Antwerp (Belgium) and the Port of Los Angeles 
(California).
14.  Finally, this report underlines digitalization as not solely a 
technological issue, but also as human capital and institutional 
issues. Any move towards increased digitization will require a high 
level of political commitment, while the establishment must have an 
appropriate legal, regulatory, and policy framework at the national 
level, across the different disciplines of the maritime, port, clearance 
agencies, and the transport and logistics sector. The move toward 
digitalization will also require improvements in human capital to 
commission, absorb, and implement the associated demands on 
stakeholders. Overcoming this challenge will necessitate considerable 
efforts; therefore, this report proposes establishing a national-level 
framework to manage the change. This framework encompasses 
three levels: an interministerial committee, a steering committee, and 
a business process committee.REFERENCES

 CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN21
Chapter 1: Introduction 
and BackgroundACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION2215.  The COVID-19 pandemic has upended lives and brought major 
disruption to economic activity across the world, precipitating an 
unprecedented global health and economic crisis . Although too 
early for a full assessment of the impact of the pandemic, it is clear 
that COVID-19 has already brought severe hardship, especially to 
landlocked and least developed countries, and poor and vulnerable 
communities. The challenges include inter alia (Latin for “among other 
things”) food insecurity, lack of medical supplies, loss of income and 
livelihood, difficulties in applying sanitary and physical distancing mea -
sures, a looming debt crisis as well as related political and security 
risks. Vulnerable sectors, including tourism, the oil and gas industry, 
maritime, air and road transport, freight forwarding, logistics, and 
wholesale and retail sectors, were hit especially hard; some might not 
recover.
16.  One of the key lessons learned early in the pandemic was 
the need to ensure business continuity of the critical supply lines, 
notably the maritime gateways, and the associated logistical chains. 
Maritime transport carries 90 percent of merchandise trade, and as 
such any impediment to the maritime logistical chains results in tangi -
ble repercussions for countries served by the port and their respec -
tive populations. Chapter 2 will outline the essential role of the mari -
time port in the movement of international trade. While to a greater 
or lesser extent, the initial challenge has been met and overcome 
in some countries, experience so far—and the risk of subsequent 
waves—underlines the urgent need to improve the resilience of the 
maritime sector, through accelerating the digitalization of maritime 
trade and logistics.
17.  However, the maritime ports are only one node in a complex 
logistical chain involving a number of interactions; digitization is 
vital to improving the competitiveness of that chain, and thus in 
reducing the cost of international trade for countries . This logisti -
cal chain requires the flow of vital medical and food supplies, critical 
agricultural products, energy streams, and other goods and services. 
To move efficiently, this flow involves cargo handling operations, 
vessel-related services and supplies, and integration with road, rail, 
and the inland water networks, together with the necessary exchange 
of data to move and clear the consignment across and between juris -
dictions. Accordingly, maritime ports must maintain and improve their 
position in respect to technological innovation and integration, both 
to ensure or improve their competitiveness and to reduce the cost of 
international trade for their respective hosts and hinterlands.Maritime transport

chandise tradeGlobal pandemic has

tion to economic activ-
ity across the world
Maritime ports must 
maintain and improve 
their position in 
respect to techno-
logical innovation 
and integrationCRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN2318.  The digital revolution has emerged in the past decade as one 
of the main drivers of change in the port and maritime sector.  By 
promoting a high level of integration between devices, agents, and 
activities, and together with the increased connectivity between ports, 
this digital revolution has created a new ecosystem in the industry—
one where being on the outside is a significant disadvantage for ports 
and countries. Because maritime transport carries 90 percent of the 
global merchandise trade, impediments to ports’ logistical chains will 
have tangible repercussions for their hinterlands and populations. 
In the short term, these impediments will likely lead to shortages of 
essential goods and higher prices; in the medium to longer term, they 
could drive slower economic growth, lower employment, and higher 
trade costs.
19.  A number of global organizations, such as UNCTAD, UNECE, 
WCO, WTO, and IMO, have been advocating the accelerated digitali -
zation of cross-border processes and documentation. The objectives 
have been to not only keep trade flowing during current and future 
events, but also protect frontline workers at sea and on land while 
enabling remote working, with contactless electronic solutions replac -
ing paper documents. Unfortunately, as of November 2020, only 49 
of the 174 member states of the International Maritime Organization 
(IMO) possess functioning port community systems (PCSs)—with 
higher income countries making up the majority of those that do 
have port community systems in place. The delay in introduction 
poses a risk to the business continuity during subsequent waves of 
the pandemic, along with a further risk over a slightly longer period, 
which would result from the development of a two-tier system, with 
laggards facing increased costs for the import and export of mer -
chandise trade.
20.  With the world’s attention now focused on preparing for a “new 
normal,” stakeholder collaboration is urgently needed to move this 
agenda forward. This collaboration must encompass intergovern -
mental organizations, governments, line ministries, and port author -
ities as well as industry stakeholders in maritime trade and logistics. 
Working together, they will accelerate the pace of digitalization so 
that port communities around the world can meet at least the mini -
mum needs in terms of electronic commerce and data exchange—in 
compliance with all relevant contractual and regulatory obligations—
and ensure no port lags behind.The objectives of 
accelerated digitali-
zation have been to 
not only keep trade 
flowing during current 
and future events, but

has emerged as one 
of the main drivers 
of change in the port 
and maritime sec-
tor and has created 
a new ecosystem 
in the industryACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION2421.  To initiate this cooperation, a group of international stake-
holders issued a recent public call to arms.  This group—comprising 
the International Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH), Baltic and 
International Maritime Council (BIMCO), the International Cargo 
Handling Coordination Association (ICHCA), the International Cham -
ber of Shipping (ICS), the International Harbor Masters’ Association 
(IHMA), the International Maritime Pilots’ Association (IMPA), the 
International Port Community Systems Association (IPCSA), the Inter -
national Shipsuppliers & Services Association (ISSA), the Federation of 
National Associations of Ship Brokers and Agents (FONASBA), and the 
PROTECT Group—issued a call to action, 1 highlighting the following 
priorities:
1. To assess the state of implementation and find ways to enforce the 
already mandatory requirements defined in the International Mar -
itime Organization’s Facilitation (IMO FAL) Convention to support 
transmission, receipt, and response of information required for 
making the transition to full-fledged single windows, for exam -
ple: the arrival, stay, and departure of ships, persons, and cargo, 
including notifications and declarations for customs, immigration, 
port, and security authorities via electronic data exchange
2. To ensure harmonization of data standards beyond the IMO FAL 
Convention to facilitate sharing of port- and berth-related master 
data for just-in-time (JIT) operation of ships and optimal resource 
deployment by vessel services and suppliers, logistics providers, 
and cargo handling and clearance, thereby saving energy, improv -
ing safety as well as cutting costs and emissions. This can be 
achieved through use of the supply chain standards of the Inter -
national Standardization Organization (ISO), the standards of the 
International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) as well as the IMO 
Compendium on Facilitation and Electronic Business
3. To strive for the introduction of port community systems and 
secure data exchange platforms in the main ports of all member 
states represented in the IMO
4. To review existing IMO Guidance on Maritime Cyber Risk Man -
agement on its ability to address cyber risks in ports, developing 
additional guidance where neededNOTE

ners-in-urgent-call-to-action-to-acceler-
ate-pace-of-digitalization/.CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN255. To raise awareness, avoid misconceptions, and promote best 
practices and standardization on how port communities can apply 
emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), advanced 
analytics, internet of things (IoT), digital twins, robotics process 
automation, autonomous systems, blockchain, virtual reality (VR), 
and augmented reality (AR)
6. To facilitate the implementation of such emerging technologies 
and other innovative tools to increase health security in port 
environments, allowing port and marine employees, contractors, 
and the vessel crew to work and interact in the safest possible 
circumstances
7. To develop a framework and roadmap to facilitate the implemen -
tation and operation of digital port platforms where authorized 
port community service providers and users can share data under 
secure data sharing protocols, enabling these platforms to con -
nect with hinterland supply chains as well
8. To establish a coalition of willing stakeholders to improve transpar -
ency of the supply chain through collaboration and standardiza -
tion, starting with the long-overdue introduction of the electronic 
bill of lading
9. To set up a capacity-building framework to support smaller, less 
developed, and under- staffed port communities, not only with 
technical facilities, but also with personnel training. Quality data 
exchange requires a trained workforce with mid- and long-term 
perspectives to build, implement, support, and sometimes override 
technology
22.  The implementation of these priorities will require collabora -
tion between maritime supply chain industry stakeholders, gov -
ernments, and multilateral and bilateral development partners. 
Above all, successful implementation calls for intergovernmental 
collaboration; the acceleration of digitalization will require change 
management at local, regional, and national levels, fostering the need 
to implement an institutional framework. The IMO secretary general 
supported this call to action and encourages collaboration between 
maritime supply chain industry stakeholders and member states as 
well as intergovernmental collaboration in addressing the nine priori -
ties for accelerating digitalization highlighted in the statement. Above all, successful 
implementation calls 
for intergovernmental 
collaboration; the 
acceleration of digi-
talization will require 
change management 
at local, regional, 
and national levels, 
fostering the need to 
implement an insti-
tutional framework.ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION2623.  However, the move to fully digitize port authorities and ports 
communities also raises new risks in terms of cybersecurity. In 2017, 
global container shipping company Maersk and its international 
port operation wing overcame an aggressive cyberattack—which 
served as a serious wake-up call. More recently in 2020, MSC, a global 
container shipping company, had its digital tools and website (www.
msc.com) hacked over the long Easter holiday weekend. Since the 
attack on MSC, several other large shipping companies have discov -
ered cyberattacks dating back over the past three years—and most 
certainly, more attacks will come. In 2019, ENISA, the European Union 
Agency for Cybersecurity, warned that cyberattacks on PCSs could 
lead to the physical shutdown of operations in an affected port, with 
all the concomitant impacts on food security, business continuity, and 
cost. Thus, improving cybersecurity stands as a key parallel priority 
for public and private stakeholders in maritime trade and logistics. As 
discussed further in chapter 5 of this report, the time has come to not 
only initiate, but more crucially, to expand the cybersecurity dialogue 
within and between port communities in order to develop collabora -
tive approaches and enhance cooperation between public and private 
sector stakeholders.
24.  Finally, this report underlines digitalization as not solely a tech -
nological issue, but also as human capital and institutional issues.  
Any move towards increased digitization will require a high level of 
political commitment, while the establishment must have an appropri -
ate legal, regulatory, and policy framework at the national level, across 
the different disciplines of the maritime, port, clearance agencies, and 
the transport and logistics sector. This move toward digitalization will 
also require improvements in human capital to commission, absorb, 
and implement the associated demands on stakeholders. Overcom -
ing this challenge will necessitate considerable efforts; therefore, this 
report proposes establishing a national-level framework to manage 
the change. Discussed in chapter 6, the framework encompasses 
three levels: an interministerial committee, a steering committee, and 
a business process committee. CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN27
Chapter 2: 
The Digitization AgendaACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION282.1 The Need for Digitization
25.  Maritime transport remains the backbone of globalized trade 
and the manufacturing supply chain, with more than four-fifths of 
global merchandise trade (by volume) carried by sea.  The maritime 
sector offers the most economical and reliable mode of transporta -
tion over long distances. Volumes carried have increased at an annual 
average of 3 percent over the period from 1970 to 2018. The total 
volumes carried at sea reached a milestone of 11 billion metric tons in 
2017, driven by growth in dry bulk commodities, followed by contain -
erized cargo, other dry bulk, oil, gas, and chemicals (UNCTAD 2019). 
While the growth in maritime volumes fell slightly in 2018, the pre-
COVID-19 projections had estimated continued growth of 2.6 percent 
in 2019, and then a return to a compound annual growth rate of 3.4 
percent over the period from 2019 to 2024. 1
26.  The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been profound, 
bringing economic activity to a near standstill, disrupting lives, and 
engendering significant social and economic costs.  The economic 
damage is already evident and represents the largest economic shock 
the world has experienced in decades. The Global Economic Pros -
pects Report (World Bank 2020) baseline forecast envisions a 5.2 per -
cent contraction in global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020, the 
deepest global recession in decades, despite the extraordinary efforts 
of governments to counter the downturn with fiscal and monetary 
policy support. Across the longer horizon, the deep recessions trig -
gered by the pandemic are expected to leave lasting scars through 
lower investment, an erosion of human capital through lost work and 
schooling, and fragmentation of global trade and supply linkages.
27.  One of the early lessons to emerge from the pandemic has 
been the critical role the maritime ports and their associated infra -
structure play in the supply chain.  Ships can carry large volumes of 
merchandise, provided that producers and consumers have access 
to adequate and effective infrastructure at the seaports and along 
the inland logistics chain to transport the volumes, in whatever form. 
The shortages of some basic supplies in developed countries during 
the early days of the pandemic revealed the fragility of the current 
logistical system in all countries, along with the need to both ensure 
business continuity and improve resilience of those infrastructures 
going forward.NOTE
1. Based on an income elasticity and the 
IMF GDP forecast pertaining at the time (see 
UNCTAD 2019).
The maritime sec-
tor offers the most 
economical and 
reliable mode of 
transportation over 
long distances.CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN2928.  More generally, how ports perform represents a crucial element 
in the cost of trade for any country. Poorly performing ports reduce 
trade volumes, an impact particularly pronounced for landlocked 
developing countries and the small island developing states. The port, 
together with the hinterland access infrastructures (whether inland 
waterway, rail, or road) constitutes a crucial link to the global market-
place and needs to operate efficiently. Efficient performance encom-
passes a myriad of factors, including the efficiency of the port itself, the 
availability of sufficient draught and dock facilities, the quality of the 
connections to road and rail services, the competitiveness of those ser-
vices, and the efficacy of the public agencies involved in clearance. Inef-
ficiencies or nontariff barrier in any of these actors will result in higher 
costs, reduced competitiveness, and lower trade (Kathuria 2018).
29.  Port performance is not only dependent on the scale of the 
physical infrastructure; the institutional infrastructure is almost 
as, if not more, important. The efficient functioning of a port, and 
its access infrastructure, needs four types of assets overseeing the 
importance of an appropriate regulatory and policy framework: 
First, the physical infrastructure, for example, sufficient draught for 
the vessels to access and egress the port, sufficient quay space and 
superstructure (cranes, for example) to load and unload the vessels, 
and the ability to efficiently move consignments in and out of the port 
to the origin or destination. Second, the digital infrastructure—which 
ensures the efficient use of the physical infrastructure and is the sub -
ject of this report. Third, the institutional, or soft, infrastructure, which 
includes all the administrative and clearance services (customs, phy -
tosanitary, and others) necessary to facilitate the import, export, and 
transit of goods, plus the supportive information and communications 
technology (ICT). Finally, the human capital in the port administra -
tion, operations, and marine services as well as the logistics sector 
supporting the port. While the overall efficiency of any port depends 
on an appropriate quality of all four assets, this report focuses on 
the latter two aspects, specifically the digitization agenda and the con-
comitant need to protect and develop human capital in the sector.The total volumes car-
ried at sea reached a 
milestone of 11 billion 
metric tons in 2017ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION3030.  The available comparable indices indicate the impact of ineffi -
ciency on international trade.  The World Bank Logistics Performance 
Index (LPI) and Doing Business Index (DBI) on trading across borders 
and the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) 
4.0, on efficiency of seaport services and border clearance, indicate 
the extent to which inefficiencies at a nation’s sea borders can impact 
international trade competitiveness. Technological innovations and 
digitalization provide opportunities to foster a more holistic approach 
and integrate the port ecosystem facilitating trusted partner collabo -
rations between government agencies and the private sector and to 
realize significant efficiencies in port transactions.
2.2 A Schematic Timeline
31.  Figure 2.1 provides a schematic of the road map for a country, 
port, and port community to follow in digitizing the maritime logistic 
chain.  The proposed road map advocates the need for a holistic 
approach. The figure illustrates the necessary short-, medium-, and 
longer-term measures to protect public health, ensure business con -
tinuity, and improve and protect the resilience of the system. 
Figure 2.1. Maritime Trade Logistics: Digitalization Road Map
CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN3132.  The first stage involves the crucial emergency measures in 
terms of digital health security monitoring and the establishment of 
crisis management centers within intergovernmental agencies.  The 
overarching objective is to protect vessel crews, port workers, and 
passengers from cruises and ferries in the “new normal” by enforcing 
social distancing and the temperature control of port workers.
33.  The second stage involves the introduction of the short-term 
measures to meet the mandatory requirements defined in the Inter-
national Maritime Organization’s Facilitation (FAL) Convention (IMO 
1965). The FAL Convention aims to support transmission, receipt, and 
response of information required for making the transition to full-
fledged maritime single windows, for example: the arrival, stay, and 
departure of ships, persons, and cargo via electronic data exchange 
(figure 2.2), thereby minimizing the number of paper-based and 
people-based contacts. This has been a mandatory requirement for all 
ports since April 2019, though implementation remains partial at best.
Figure 2.2. Maritime Single Window
ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION32Figure 2.3. Port Community System: Optimal Architecture
34.  In parallel to the need for ports to meet the mandatory 
requirements of the FAL Convention, discussions must be held on 
the nine key data elements related to port call optimization.  Port call 
optimization allows ships to optimize their speed during the voyage 
to facilitate a timely arrival at the pilot boarding place, thus securing 
berths, fairways, and nautical services at the destination ports. This 
just-in-time (JIT) arrival will also increase a port’s relative attractiveness 
and hence its competitiveness.
35.  Ports must also commence the establishment and introduction 
of a port community system.  A port community system, is a platform 
to optimize, manage, and automate the port and logistics processes 
through a single submission of data in the transport and logistics 
chain (see figure 2.3). The coherence between the port communi -
ty system, port management system, and maritime single window 
should be ensured to allow the maritime and trade logistics actors 
to benefit from the digitalization of these processes and associated 
applications, logically culminating in the smart port. CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN3336.  Importantly, increasing the digitization of the maritime logis-
tical chain, while essential, also brings new risks.  Between February 
and May 2020, cyberattacks increased 400 percent in the maritime 
industry (Captive International 2020). The risk of a cyberattack has 
emerged as the top risk for port authorities and the wider port com -
munity of stakeholders, necessitating improved cybersecurity at the 
port community ecosystem level. The next two chapters present in 
more detail the recommended measures, delineated between those 
measures recommended for immediate implementation and those 
recommended for short-term implementation, followed by those that 
are recommended for medium-term implementation.REFERENCES

Chapter 3: Immediate and 
Short-Term RecommendationsCRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN35
3.1 Introduction
37.  Chapter 3 provides an overview of recommended immediate 
and short-term measures, in terms of digital health security for 
countries, port authorities, and ports to implement. Short term is 
defined here as, ideally, between three and twelve months; however, 
this is a recommended timeline to clearly underscore the urgency of 
the agenda, as an aspiration rather than a definitive timeline.
ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION363.2 The Immediate Recommendations
3.2.1 Improving Digital Health Security
38. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global healthcare 
systems has underlined the need to improve digital health security at 
critical infrastructure, such as ports, to protect workers. Digital health 
security consists of those digital measures designed and implemented 
to protect the health and welfare of port workers, and involve such 
measures as the enforcement of social distancing rules and the tem-
perature control of port workers through the use of technologies such 
as thermal cameras, drones, and electronic wearables, which could be 
integrated into a digital port security command and control center.
ELECTRONIC WEARABLES
39.  The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a dramatic impact on 
the global logistics and supply chains and requires the identification of 
creative solutions to facilitate business continuity in the “new normal.”  
One of the most widely adopted, if not always obeyed, measures 
is the introduction of maintaining social distance. The introduction 
of maintaining a defined distance between individuals (the actual 
distance varies by country and sometimes by mode) has challenged 
normal business workflows and processes and inspired companies to 
find new solutions to guarantee worker safety and health. 
40.  The Port of Antwerp in Belgium is currently piloting one of the 
most interesting examples of digitized solutions. The Port of Antwerp 
has partnered with a Belgian startup, which specializes in future-proof 
internet of things (IoT) solutions for maritime services, port terminals, 
and petrochemical plants. The latter’s mission is to support the global 
digitization of the port industry and help shape the port of the future. 
In 2019, the startup developed a wearable device, similar to the more 
industrial wearables in the market, but equipped with several secu -
rity and safety applications, particular to the port context. At the end 
of February 2020, the startup added a new function to monitor and 
maintain the physical distancing required, and to facilitate contact 
tracing through device-to-device communication. 
CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN37
41.  In order to assess the new functionality in a professional and 
complex environment, the Port of Antwerp collaborated with the 
startup to conduct several tests.  In particular, the tests focused on 
man-to-machine detection, man-down detection, safe work in closed 
spaces, and a lone worker alarm (that includes a panic button and 
man-down detection). As the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic 
unfolded in the spring of 2020, radius testing of the wearable elec -
tronic device was performed at the end of April, which also garnered 
media attention (figures 3.1, panels a and b).
42.  These tests were conducted during standard 12-hour shifts 
worked by the port authority’s technical and nautical staff.  In total, 
eight different individuals participated in the pilot: five boatmen 
tested the device outdoors, on a lock platform while assisting vessels 
to moor in the lock, and three vessel traffic operators tested the wear -
ables in an indoors working environment. Privacy protection is includ -
ed by design and the device is fully compliant with the data protection 
regulations; the devices store no personal data. The device itself 
generates a soft signal (vibration and orange indicator light) when the 
distance between two or more devices is closer than 2 meters. A sec -
ond and more explicit signal (loud alarm, vibration, and red flashing 
indicator) is generated when a device detects less than 1.5 meters of 
distance between devices. This test included a technical evaluation as 
well as a user experience interview.
ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION3843.  Both tests yielded positive results, with users considering 
the wearable helpful in ensuring workers maintain the 1.5-meter 
distance. Users also spoke of being surprised at the dimensions of 
this distance, indicating a tendency to misjudge what was required 
to maintain the separation. At a technical level, the device passed all 
tests and remained fully functional within a defined radius, despite 
the presence of several elements that could have blocked or jammed 
the signal. Further testing in more specific and difficult working condi -
tions will be executed in the coming months, though the preliminary 
results indicate an electronic wearable will have a role in the post 
COVID-19 “normal” working environment.Figure 3.1. Port of Antwerp: Pilot Testing of Electronic Wearable Device

44.  Thermal cameras have helped with epidemic prevention and 
control in many settings and many countries. For example, thermal 
cameras were introduced at many points of entry during the 2014–16 
Ebola outbreak in West Africa. In comparison to the traditional meth-
ods of measuring body temperature, thermal cameras offer a signifi-
cant improvement in speed and accuracy. In the maritime sector, Port 
Coronel in Chile became one of the first ports to introduce this tech-
nology in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, placing the devices 
in the main access areas and in the logistics center of cargo terminals, 
to measure with a high degree of precision the body temperature 
of workers entering the terminal. Cameras are also used to monitor 
the temperature of the passengers at ferry and cruise terminals, with 
Portsmouth International Port being the first port in the United King-
dom to install such a scanner to help ensure passenger safety.
 
45.  However, thermal cameras should not be considered a pan -
acea. While thermal imaging systems generally detect a high body 
temperature accurately when used appropriately, they do not detect 
any other infection symptoms, and a high body temperature does not 
necessarily mean a person has a COVID-19 infection—thus highlight -
ing the need for additional testing to confirm the initial abnormal 
finding. In addition, one of the major disadvantages associated with 
the use of a thermal camera, or even the more orthodox measures 
of body temperature, is the relatively high proportion of individuals 
infected with COVID-19 who are contagious, test positive, but remain 
asymptomatic. Recent research suggests this number could be as 
high as 40 percent. 1 
NOTE

Center for Disease Control estimates that

46.  The formal definition of an Unmanned aircraft system (UAS) 
is any aircraft intended to be flown without a pilot on board. 2 
Now available in a variety of types, UAS are designed with different 
capabilities to fit user needs, such as autonomous (no pilot input) or 
remotely piloted modes of operation. The more common term adopt -
ed by the media and understood by the public is “drone.” UAS provide 
a prime example of an emerging technology in the new industrial 
era. Characterized by significantly lower costs and complexity when 
compared with manned systems, these flying robots have the poten -
tial to unlock the lower skies as a mobility resource and enable new 
applications, and are being increasingly used to improve efficiency 
and reduce cost of delivering medical supplies and blood (as done 
in Rwanda and Ghana). In addition, demand is accelerating for more 
established uses such as survey and mapping applications, land digi -
tization and tenure, agriculture and precision farming, infrastructure 
and construction monitoring as well as disaster risk management.
NOTE
2. The definition of unmanned aircraft systems 
(UAS) was presented at the International Civil 
Aviation Organization’s (IACO) First Meeting 
of the Asia/Pacific Unmanned Aircraft Systems 
Task Force (APUASTF/1) in Bangkok, Thailand, 
held April 3–5, 2017. For more details see

and Concepts Describing Unmanned Aircraft 
Systems,” available online: https://www.

WP07.pdf.CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN4147.  The not yet fully realized, ports have recognized the potential 
uses of UASs for enhancing operations.  Pilots have already been 
undertaken in a number of ports, including, among others, Antwerp, 
Rotterdam, and a number of ports in the United Kingdom, test -
ing drone use in areas such as asset management, environmental 
sustainability, and security (Green Port 2019). As one example of an 
emerging use, the Norwegian Maritime Authority (NMA) conducted 
sulfur emissions testing using a drone in 2019, and has announced 
plans to purchase three new sulfur sensors as part of its cooperation 
with the coast guard and the Norwegian Radiation Protection Author -
ity to monitor and ensure vessel emissions meet the new maximum 
limit (0.5 percent of sulfur in marine fuels) now mandated by the IMO 
and the European Union (European Commission 2020). In the context 
of the COVID-19 pandemic and the maritime sector, drones have 
been used at ports to enforce social distancing and face-mask wear -
ing, monitor crowds, facilitate aerial broadcasting, spray disinfectant, 
conduct aerial thermal sensing, monitor traffic, and deliver medical 
supplies at ships.
48. An example from Belgium illustrates how drones could be 
implemented to increase public safety. Within three weeks after the 
COVID-19 lockdown in mid-March 2020, the Port of Antwerp was ready 
to implement an automated drone solution to monitor social distanc-
ing at the largest truck parking in the port (which holds approximately 
200 trucks), as most drivers come from countries other than Belgium 
and find it challenging to understand the country’s regulations on 
social distancing. Unfortunately, the automated drone could not be 
operated due to pending official approval by the responsible authori-
ty. Instead, large digital screens were used to inform the drivers, with 
notifications in eight languages. Similarly, in the United States, port 
police at the Port of Los Angeles in California are using drones to 
enhance public safety across port operations (Link-Wills 2020).

49.  Early lessons learned from the pandemic include the need to 
ensure coordination across all the relevant public agencies.  During 
COVID-19, cross-agency cooperation is critical to ensuring business 
continuity in the maritime sector. This coordination helps establish 
a digital crisis management platform that integrates all government 
agencies related to maritime trade, manage crew health and crew 
changes, ensure sufficient stocks of critical equipment—such as 
masks, tests and drugs—monitor hospitals and immigration needs in 
real time, anticipate the evolution of the crisis, and propose measures 
to control the pandemic at the port community level. More than 
nine months into the pandemic, coordination of this type remains an 
immediate priority. Two recent developments in this sphere include 
the Philippines Port Authority September 2020 rollout of a COVID-19 
electronic tracing system specifically designed for the port context 
(PPA 2020), and the development, by technology companies such as 
Thales Group, of commercial electronic crisis management plat -
forms that integrate “the power of big data, artificial intelligence, and 
cybersecurity.”3

50.  After the immediate digital measures above, the following 
measures are recommended to follow as closely as feasible, and 
ideally within a period of 12 months.  These measures are intend -
ed less to ensure immediate business continuity, as in the previous 
cases, than to meet the mandatory requirements, improve resilience 
and efficiency, and protect business continuity in future. Hence, this 
section will discuss short-term measures for the port community eco -
system, including the introduction of electronic data interchange (EDI) 
and the maritime single window (MSW), under the Convention on the 
Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic (the FAL Convention), port 
call optimization, and the establishment of port community systems 
(PCSs) for port authorities to communicate with all port stakeholders 
to improve the resilience of the maritime logistic chain.
3.3.1 Electronic Data Interchange and the FAL Convention
51.  Ships, crew, goods, and passengers that travel across nation-
al borders are subject to a range of government controls, both on 
arrival and departure. These controls address a wide range of issues, 
including public health, revenue protection, security, immigration, 
controls on import and export, and sanctions enforcement. A range 
of practical procedures and processes must be followed to ensure 
maritime safety as well as the provision of general port services to 
ships. As with the regulatory controls, these could be due to national 
or regional requirements or mandated by international conventions 
and agreements. All of these controls and procedures, whether local, 
national, international, regulatory, or commercial, have features in 
common—all require the provision of information to a range of dif -
ferent agencies and entities, and require action taken by ships, crews, 
and ports. The process by which this myriad of regulations, require -
ments, and procedures are simplified and harmonized is known as 
“facilitation” and forms an integral part of the World Trade Organiza -
tion Agreement on Trade Facilitation (WTO TFA Agreement), adopted 
in 2018. A range of practi-
cal procedures and 
processes must be 
followed to ensure 
maritime safety as 
well as the provi-
sion of general port 
services to ships.ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION44WHAT IS A FAL CONVENTION ELECTRONIC DATA EXCHANGE?
52.  The need for standardization and reduction of unnecessary 
bureaucracy in the maritime sector was recognized by the Inter -
national Maritime Organization (IMO). In response, the IMO was 
developed the FAL Convention, 4 which has been in force since 1967 
and ratified by 124 member countries. The FAL Convention is updat -
ed on a regular basis by member governments through the FAL 
Committee—which meets once a year at the IMO headquarters in 
London. The convention’s main objectives are to prevent unnecessary 
delays in maritime traffic, to aid cooperation between governments, 
and to secure the highest practical degree of uniformity in formali -
ties and other procedures. The convention contains standards and 
recommended practices for ports to simplify formalities, documentary 
requirements, and procedures on the arrival, stay, and departure 
of vessels. It also encourages the use of standardized FAL forms by 
authorities and governments in requesting necessary information 
from the master or ship’s agent in relation to controls and proce -
dures. The necessary information, and the relevant forms covering all 
data requested by public authorities’ regulatory requirements under 
the FAL Convention include the following: 5
• IMO General Declaration (FAL form 1) 
• Cargo Declaration (FAL form 2)
• Ship’s Stores Declaration (FAL form 3)
• Crew’s Effects Declaration (FAL form 4)
• Crew List (FAL form 5)
• Passenger List (FAL form 6) 
• Dangerous Goods Manifest (FAL form 7) 
• Security-related information as required under International Con -
vention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) (regulation XI-2/9.2.2)
• Advance electronic cargo information for customs risk assessment 
purposes
• Advanced notification form for waste delivery to port reception 
facilities
53.  In any port call, the submission of this information involves a 
wide range of stakeholders.  Shipping companies engaged in inter -
national trade must submit large volumes of information and docu -
ments to terminal operators, port authorities, and other public sector 
bodies, in order to comply with regulatory and port entry require -
ments. These include, inter alia (Latin for “among other things”), 
maritime agencies, customs, health, border police, immigration, NOTES

mitted through several different authorities, each with its own specific 
system and/or paper forms. These requirements, together with the 
associated compliance costs, constitute a burden both to govern -
ments and to the business community. The inefficiencies and result -
ing increase in costs represent a major barrier to the development of 
international trade, particularly in the less developed countries. 
WHAT IS A FAL CONVENTION ELECTRONIC DATA INTERCHANGE?
54.  Accordingly, the FAL Convention makes a number of recom-
mendations for member governments to improve coordination and 
communication between parties.  The first stage is the introduction 
of electronic data interchanges between ship and ports, commonly 
known as EDI. An EDI system is intended to simplify the process of 
providing and sharing the necessary information to fulfill regula -
tory requirements for both authorities and shipping industry, and 
removes the need for successive paper submissions and the associ -
ated time requirements. Its use can result in improved efficiency and 
effectiveness of official controls, while also reducing costs for both 
business and administrative parties. The FAL Convention obligates 
public authorities to establish systems for the electronic exchange of 
information, with an original deadline of April 8, 2019—subsequently 
extended to April 8, 2020.
55.  In addition, the FAL Convention encourages the use of the mar-
itime single window concept, to enable all information required by 
public authorities in connection with the arrival, stay, and departure 
of ships, persons, and cargo, to be submitted via a single portal 
without duplication. Establishing a single window, facility delivers 
several benefits: enhances the availability and handling of informa -
tion, simplifies and expedites information flows between trade and 
government, and brings about greater harmonization and better 
sharing of the relevant data across governmental systems, result -
ing in meaningful gains to all parties involved in cross-border trade. 
Public authorities may require the same identical data for different 
purposes, including identification of the ship, date and time of arrival, 
port of departure, and cargo information; however, combining, har -
monizing, and minimizing the information required from ship masters 
and agents has been a longstanding request from trade, an issue 
which could be addressed through the MSW concept.The FAL Convention 
obligates public 
authorities to estab-
lish systems for the 
electronic exchange 
of informationACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION4656.  The FAL Convention defines “single window” as a facility that 
allows submission of standardized information covered by the FAL 
Convention to a single-entry point. Clearance processes can be 
facilitated by combining common and harmonized data elements 
into a single message according to commonly agreed standards and 
format and sent electronically to a single official destination, rather 
than being sent to each authority separately. The FAL Committee 
issued revised guidelines for setting up an MSW 6 to serve as a source 
of information, advice, and guidance for interested member states. 
The guidelines also provide examples of the experience and knowl -
edge gained by some member states in approaching implementation 
(figure 3.2). 
Figure 3.2. Maritime Single Window
57.  However, despite the advantages, the number of countries that 
have developed a fully functional MSW remains low.  To date, many 
countries have developed parallel single windows addressing the 
needs of different authorities, requiring traders to submit the same 
information more than once to several single windows. Thus, realizing 
the full benefits of the MSW concept will involve a consolidated move 
toward a definitive single window covering all aspects of regulations 
and business to government exchanges of data. Box 3.1 provides an 
example of the benefits of a fully functional MSW.NOTE

In 2017, the Panama Maritime Authority and the Panama Canal Authority announced the launch of an 
initiative to develop the Panama Maritime Single Window System (VUMPA), with the objective to facilitate 
international maritime transport—through simplification and harmonization of the processes—in com -
pliance with the FAL Convention.
As part of the initiative, every ship must now declare the required information electronically through 
the VUMPA system, so that all government institutions carry out the risk assessment, prior to the arrival 
of the vessel, and that the first inspection of an international ship upon arrival is carried out by a single 
inspector of the Republic of Panama. 
The Panama Canal and the Panama Maritime Authority estimate that the introduction of VUMPA has 
reduced the need for more than 300,000 paper forms and documents, improving the efficiency and 
carbon footprint of transhipment procedures and saving up to 3,260 person hours annually.

58.  The need for harmonized maritime-related data and common 
agreed standards led to the development of the IMO Compendium 
on Facilitation and Electronic Business. 7 The IMO Compendium is a 
tool for software developers who design the systems needed to sup -
port transmission, receipt, and response via electronic exchange, of 
information required for arrival, stay, and departure of ship, persons, 
and cargo to or from a port. The compendium consists of an IMO 
data set and IMO reference data model 8 agreed by the main orga -
nizations involved in the development of standards for the electronic 
exchange of maritime-related information linked to the FAL Conven -
tion. These organizations include the World Customs Organization 
(WCO), the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), 
and the International Organization for Standardization Technical 
Committee 8 (ISO/TC8, Ships and Marine Technology). The IMO, WCO, 
UNECE and ISO also collaborate under a new partnership to support 
increased maritime digitalization.
59.  By harmonizing the data elements required during a port call 
and by standardizing electronic messages, the IMO Compendium 
facilitates the exchange of ship-to-port information and the interop -
erability of single windows, thereby reducing the administrative 
burden for ships linked to formalities and ports.  The IMO Compen -
dium is not conceived to create “new” standards, but rather as a tool 
to harmonize existing standards and produce guidance for interested NOTES

ing standards. The compendium also allows companies involved in 
maritime trade or transport to create software that can communicate 
across standards. This means that any organization responsible for a 
standard or a data model in the scope of a ship approaching a port is 
welcome to add and map data to the IMO Compendium. 
60.  Since July 2019, the Expert Group on Data Harmonization 
(EGDH) has been responsible for the technical maintenance of 
the IMO Compendium and for further expanding its data set and 
data model to areas beyond the FAL Convention. These include the 
exchange of logistics and operational port and shipping data and 
maritime services as provided in Resolution MSC.467(101) and MSC.1/
Circ.1610 (documents available online at https://www.imo.org ). The 
EGDH also aims to contribute to support electronic data exchange for 
all IMO instruments. The EGDH meets twice a year at IMO’s London 
headquarters and brings together IMO member states, industry 
representatives, and key standards organizations involved in elec -
tronic exchange of information related to regulatory port clearance, 
including WCO, UNECE, ISO, IHO, and the International Association of 
Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities (IALA). 
61.  In light of the increase in the use of digitalized systems across 
the maritime sector, the FAL Committee has also considered the cyber 
risks. The objective is to protect the maritime transport network from 
cyberthreats, including the need to address particular risks to MSWs, 
processes for electronic certificates and data exchange between 
ships and shore, pre-arrival information based on the FAL Conven -
tion, and processes involving the ship–port interface. Relevant IMO 
guidance includes the Guidelines on Maritime Cyber Risk Manage -
ment 9 to address cyber risks in the maritime domain and Resolution 
MSC.428(98), Maritime Cyber Risk Management in Safety Manage -
ment Systems, 10 encouraging shipping companies to address cyber 
risks in their safety management systems. In an effort to establish 
guidelines on cybersecurity on ships, leading industry stakeholders 
have provided an overarching scope of nature in relation to cyberse -
curity, which chapter 5 will discuss in more detail.NOTES

62.  The arrival of a ship at the pilot boarding place at the precise 
time the berth, fairway, and marine services are waiting is called 
port call optimization.  The Global Industry Alliance to Support Low 
Carbon Shipping (GIA) was officially launched on June 29, 2017, 
alongside the first Intersessional Working Group on the Reduction of 
Greenhouse Gas Emissions (ISWG-GHG) meeting at IMO headquar -
ters. The aim of the GIA is to develop innovative solutions to address 
common barriers to decarbonizing the shipping sector. 11 The work 
of the GIA on the just-in-time (JIT) arrival of ship is a concept in which 
a ship maintains the optimal operating speed to arrive at the pilot 
boarding place to ensure availability of berth, fairway, and nautical 
services (such as pilots, tugs, and linesmen). 
63.  The JIT arrival concept has been identified by the GIA as a fea-
sible opportunity to both reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions12 
and improve port competitiveness. JIT also provides an opportunity 
for optimal utilization of port assets, improve safety and environ -
mental outcomes, along with lower costs for shipping lines, shippers, 
terminals, and ports. Work on port call optimization (PCO) is led by 
the International Taskforce on Port Call Optimization, which has also NOTE

MEPC 74/INF.34.ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION50written the Port Information Manual, aimed at providing a better 
understanding of the data exchanged in the ship–port interface and 
of the existing international standards connecting ships and ports. 
The scope of data covers the data set of the ship–port interface data, 
directly or indirectly related to the port authority, based on a trade 
and port agnostic business process and taking into account compli -
ance with IMO regulations, contractual obligations, and other relevant 
public authorities such as customs. 
WHAT IS INVOLVED IN PORT CALL OPTIMIZATION?
64.  The goal of PCO is to optimize sustainable supply chains, safe 
and sustainable berth-to-berth navigation, deadweight, port stay, 
berth utilization, and other port resources and services. Successful 
PCO results in greater safety, a cleaner environment, and lower costs 
for shipping lines, shippers, terminals, and ports. In order to improve 
the quality and availability of data in the ship–port interface, the fol -
lowing data points are fundamental for optimizing: (a) the movement 
of the vessel—”Where is the berth? When is it available? and (b) the 
cargo on board—Where is the cargo? When is it available for hinter -
land transport?
65.  The quality and availability of data plays an integral role in the 
journey toward port call optimization; data standardization rep -
resents the first vital step in the process.  The following paragraphs 
look at how a port should handle data to achieve PCO.
• Data sharing by the data owner is an important aspect of improv -
ing data quality and availability. If data are not shared by the 
data owner, data updates might be delayed, and the data are not 
binding. However, data owners currently struggle to share data, as 
much data are in different standards and formats and at differ -
ent times. However, data owners prefer to share one file to many 
users, to minimize the administrative burden and avoid errors and 
delays in update. Efficient, accurate data sharing requires stan -
dardization, which again requires investments in databases and in 
a culture change of people. For this reason, scoping the data is a 
critical two-part step: first to select the data elements needed to 
achieve compliance with IMO regulations and other standards, and 
then to select the data elements with the most impact to justify 
investments. The quality and avail-
ability of data plays 
an integral role in the 
journey toward port 
call optimization; data 
standardization rep-
resents the first vital 
step in the process.
Data sharing by the 
data owner is an 
important aspect of 
improving data quality 
and availability.CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN51• To ensure these investments in databases or culture change 
remain sustainable for ports and shipping alike, the most robust 
standardization body for both shipping and ports should be 
selected for each data element; in this way, standards will be main -
tained and available for the foreseeable future. Acceleration and 
acceptance of digitalization in the ship–port interface depend on 
both shipping and ports committing to the same standardization 
bodies—to avoid a proliferation of solutions and incompatibility 
between standards and systems, and, ultimately, futile investments 
into implementing standards that are either not fit for purpose or 
not viable for all stakeholders across the supply chain. 
• Finally, planning such investments requires a road map per data 
set to understand when a particular standard becomes avail -
able for implementation, as realizing full interoperability of data 
requires not only the data element definition, but also a logical 
data model, application programming interface (API) specification, 
and technical and business performance requirements. The timing 
of each step is important in planning investments in standardiza -
tion between shipping and ports. 
• Shipping and port subject matter experts collaborate to select the 
most critical data elements in the ship–port interface necessary for 
compliance and with the largest impact on safety, environment, 
and security.
ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION5266.  The priority list of nautical data elements includes data 
elements for (a) generic port data, (b) depth identification, and (c) 
location of terminals, berths, and berth positions.
• With their strong impact on navigational safety and environment, 
these data elements are necessary to be compliant with the IMO’s 
Code of Practice for the Safe Loading and Unloading of Bulk Carri -
ers (known as the BLU Code) 13 and IMO Resolution A.893(21), 14 
which regulates safe berth to berth navigation, and to be com -
pliant with safe port clauses in Baltic and International Maritime 
Council (BIMCO) contracts. The latter is especially important in the 
tanker and dry bulk trade (representing about 85 percent of cargo 
ton miles in shipping), where charterers need to select the right 
ship to fit both the berth in the load port and the discharge port. 
• With 93 member states, the most robust standardization body for 
these data elements is the International Hydrographic Organi -
zation (IHO), which has been working with national hydrographic 
offices since standards were first introduced. 
• A submission to the IHO is made to define these data elements 
and realize real-time data exchange between a port authority and 
the national hydrographic office, which in turn delivers up-to-date 
electronic charts and books to ships to aid safe navigation. Hydro -
graphic offices have a legal and moral obligation to provide accu -
rate, contemporary data. The clear capture and sharing of data 
allow the adoption of best practices and helps to demonstrate the 
observance to due diligence. It ensures hydrographic offices and 
port authorities have worked together to discharge their collective 
SOLAS responsibilities for the benefit of each nation and the safety 
of the mariners. Accurate data sharing also strengthens the legal 
position of the port in the event of an incident. This submission 
has resulted in a working group with the highest priority within the 
IHO.
 
67.  The priority list of administrative data includes three data 
elements necessary to complete notifications and declarations for 
in-port authorities such as customs and immigration, as follows: (a) 
update information in the IMO Global Integrated Shipping Informa -
tion System (GISIS) database ( https://www.gisis.imo.org ), (b) accept 
ship data with IMO FAL Compendium data format and structure, and 
(c) plan for clearance.NOTES

authorities, allowing the port master and vessels to enter ports or 
begin cargo operations. These data elements have a strong impact 
on safety, as the port master should spend most of his or her time 
on the bridge rather than completing numerous administrative 
requirements, which need to be returned to the ship agent, who 
then processes the data into an application (a PCS, for example) or 
into hard copy forms. The data also have a strong impact on envi -
ronment, as timely clearances of authorities helps ensure smooth 
transit of both ships and their cargo. 
• The most robust standardization body for these data elements 
is the 174-member FAL Committee, together with ISO, WCO, and 
UNECE, who have been working on FAL forms since standards 
were first introduced. Therefore, a submission to this standard -
ization body was required to define these data elements and to 
include the time stamps required both for clearances to realize 
real-time data exchange between ship, authorities, and supply 
chain. This submission was approved in the most recent FAL Com -
mittee meeting (no. 44).
68.  The priority list of operational data includes three data ele-
ments necessary to (a) plan arrival and departure times at berth and 
at pilot boarding place, as well as (b) starting and completion times 
of cargo and ship services, including (c) clearances required by the 
International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code. 
• Port planning for an arriving or departing ship is normally orga -
nized by the port authority, based on the berth planning of

welcome at a specific pilot boarding place or which ship can leave 
from a specific berth, based on maximum vessel sizes, maximum 
conditions (weather, tide), availability of fairway, and nautical 
services. 
• These data elements are necessary to be compliant with Marine 
Labor Convention (MLC) and ISPS regulations, and to contribute to 
the IMO GHG objective of 50 percent emission reduction by 2050. 
These data elements have a strong impact on safety (rest hour 
planning), environment (JIT arrivals), and security (ISPS, avoiding 
piracy areas). Because these data elements are also used for com -
pleting notifications and declarations, common sense indicates 
they should be developed under the same body (FAL Committee) 
and then built on an existing work. Therefore, at the most recent 
FAL Committee meeting (no. 44), a submission to this standardiza -
tion body was made—to expand their scope to include operational 
data and defining data elements for ship services.
69.  The problems of data interchange should not be underestimat -
ed, and requires equivalency, willingness, and capacity.  Three issues 
in particular should be noted:
• First, data owners in the ship–port interface in general have limited 
information technology (IT) resources and could be lacking an 
understanding of what data is required and in which format, as 
current digitization of the ship–port interface is in the early stages, 
even in ports in developed countries. 
• Second, guidance per data set is needed, allowing data owners to 
understand where and how to start in a step-by-step guide. IMO 
cannot enforce the use of standards in national waters; however, 
they can provide nonmandatory instrumental guidance, refer -
encing to industry standards. Development of such guidance has 
been proposed to FAL Committee during the most recent meeting 
(no. 44). First examples of such guidance include the Just In Time 
Arrival Guide15 published by the IMO GIA to support low carbon 
shipping and the Port Information Manual, 16 published by the 
International Taskforce Port Call Optimization (ITPCO) project. 
• Third, apart from guidance, data owners also need incentives. 
Again, the IMO and industry can work together on, for example, 
the publication and certification of data owners who have imple -
mented the standards for the minimum set of data elements.NOTES

70.  A PCS is an electronic platform connecting the multiple systems 
operated by a variety of public and private stakeholders that com -
prise a seaport or airport community.  Port community systems play 
a major role as ports and countries move towards the single-window 
environment, and have a long tradition in Europe, having been first 
established in ports in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom in 
the late 1970s or early 1980s. Ports in countries such as the Neth -
erlands and Spain established their port community systems in the 
1990s or early 2000s. While in the last decade, the port authority of 
Cotonou, Benin, established the first PCS in Sub-Saharan Africa, and 
received the “Gold IT” award in recognition of its successful imple -
mentation and operation at the 28th World Ports Conference held in 
Los Angeles in May 2013. The PCS at the Port of Cotonou has helped 
reduce dwell time from more than 39 days in 2011 to an estimated 6 
days in 2012 and reduced paper consumption by more than 1 million 
A4 paper sheets per annum.
71.  The current environment, along with the advent of COVID-19 
pandemic—with its greater emphasis on the need to improve digitali-
zation of ports—underscores the potential contribution of a PCS. This 
is summarized in the following statement from Port of Los Angeles: 
The COVID-19 crisis has provided an opportunity for ports around the world to assess how technol -
ogy can improve our public health response and support economic recovery. We have to accelerate 
our efforts. At the Port of Los Angeles, we have been working on this port community system, the 
only one in the United States, for four years. I have called on the federal government to adopt a 
nationwide port community system. We have learned so much from our colleagues in Europe, Asia, 
and the Middle East. It is time to enable that technology in the United States. As the economy begins 
to re-emerge, data is going to drive our supply chain partners and us toward greater success. 
Gene Seroka
Executive Director, Port of Los Angeles  ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION56WHAT IS A PORT COMMUNITY SYSTEM?
72.  The International Port Community System Association (IPCSA) 
defines “port community system” 17 in the following way (further 
illustrated in figure 3.3):
• a neutral and open electronic platform enabling intelligent and 
secure exchange of information between public and private stake -
holders in order to improve the competitive position of the sea 
and air ports’ communities
• optimizes, manages, and automates port and logistics processes 
through a single submission of data and connecting transport and 
logistics chains

provide all sectors and players within a port community environ-
ment with tools specific to their needs, thus delivering a tightly inte-
grated system. Developed for port users, in most cases by port users, 
a PCS encompasses the process flows of maritime and air related 
to exports, imports, transhipment, consolidations, hazardous cargo, 
waste disposal, crew and passenger reporting, terminal operations, 
hinterland operations, inspections, voyage notifications, and statis-
tics reporting. Note it does not cover the responsibilities related to 
the management of the port, which would require a broader system, 
known as a port management system, which is discussed in chapter 4.
74.  In general, port community systems provide a wide range of 
services and key features, which can be summarized as follows:
• Easy, fast, and efficient EDI information exchange and centraliza -
tion, available 24/7/365
• Customs declarations, including inspections
• Electronic handling of all information regarding import and export 
of containerized, general, roll-on/roll-off, and bulk cargo
• Status information and control, tracking, and tracing through the 
whole logistics chain
• Processing of dangerous goods 
• Processing of maritime and other statistics
WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF A PORT COMMUNITY SYSTEM?
75.  The core benefits provided by a PCS include higher efficien -
cy and speed regarding port processes, particularly through the 
reduction of paperwork. The functionality is aimed at eliminating 
unnecessary paperwork—which can clog up cargo handling—and 
streamline processes through an integrated system. Using electronic 
data exchange, the PCS is an effective real-time information system: 
fast, focused, flexible, and multi-faceted, with the main objective of 
optimizing current supply chain processes by improving operational 
efficiency and establishing data exchange standards to develop trans -
parency at all stages of cargo handling, including vessel discharge 
and loading, customs clearance, port health formalities and delivery in 
and out of the terminal. In this way, port community systems con -
tribute to sustainable transport logistics and support the ambitions 
to meet global carbon reduction requirements. A PCS also offers 
improved security, cost reduction, and potentially more competitive -
ness for each user, as illustrated in table 3.1.Port community 
systems can also facili-
tate trade and act as

government organizations and border agencies, are shown in appen -
dices 1 and 2.CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN59PORT COMMUNITY SYSTEMS STREAMLINE THE 
CLEARANCE PROCESSES AND FACILITATE TRADE
77.  Ports are essential nodes of supply chains at any geographic 
scale. Supply chains handle very differentiated products—such as 
dangerous goods, products of animal origin for human consump -
tion—and, to protect consumers, governmental agencies must sub -
ject these goods to different controls, usually on aspects related to 
the rules of trade, quality, and safety. Many controls could be carried 
out in different points in the supply chain, though traditionally most 
have been carried out in ports. The various controls are generally 
undertaken by public agencies reporting to appropriate line minis -
tries, which can make coordination difficult. In many cases, a prevail -
ing authority is determined, generally the customs service, which will 
coordinate controls and avoid unnecessary complications and delay. 
However, in order to apply this type of solution, advanced informa -
tion on the consignment, along with the status of the respective 
controls, must be provided to all relevant public agencies. Ports need 
to do everything in their power to expedite the flow of goods and to 
minimize the cost of such flows, and to that end should provide digital 
solutions such as a PCS to share the information, coordinate border 
services interventions, and avoid unnecessary delay and cost.
78.  Port community systems can also facilitate trade and act as 
gateways into single windows, or in some cases act as the single 
window for a country, subject to its mandate.  The WTO TFA 18 was 
the first agreement concluded at the WTO by all members. The 
agreement entered into force on February 22, 2017, when the WTO 
obtained the two-thirds acceptance of the agreement from its 164 
members. The TFA contains provisions for expediting the movement, 
release, and clearance of goods, including goods in transit. It also sets 
out measures for effective cooperation between customs and other 
appropriate authorities on trade facilitation and customs compliance 
issues. The agreement aims to help improve transparency, increase 
possibilities to participate in global value chains, and reduce the 
scope for corruption. PCSs support the implementation of the TFA 
through the optimization of data exchange for business-to-business 
(B2B) and business-to-government (B2G) processes (see figure 3.4). 
79.  The TFA contains reference to UNECE Recommendation No. 
33, which is part of the list of trade facilitation measures devel -
oped by UNECE over the past 40 years.  These recommendations 
reflect best practices in trade procedures and data and documentary NOTE

trade procedures and information flows. Specifically related to this 
are the suite of UNECE recommendations on single windows—recom -
mendations 33 through 37, 19 which cover single windows, data sim -
plification and standards, legal framework, interoperability and single 
submission portals. PCSs fall primarily within the single submission 
portals recommendation, though some, if not all, contain aspects of 
the other single window recommendation.

80.  However, as the trade facilitation agenda moves forward, sev -
eral single window initiatives are taking shape in different parts of 
the world. As a result, it is challenging to estimate the number of cur -
rent operating systems, due to the differentiated single window mod -
els adopted and the extent of cross-border operations and functions 
performed. In most cases customs administrations have a pivotal role 
in implementation and operation of single window systems across 
all six WCO Regions. The WCO, through their Building Single Win -
dow Environment (SWE) tool, 20 have developed material that assists 
customs organizations in supporting cross-border trade. Similarly, 
the IMO has crafted guidelines for an MSW and in April 2019, the 
FAL Committee issued revised guidelines for setting up an MSW, as NOTE

81.  However, while intergovernmental organizations such as the 
WTO, UNECE, WCO, and IMO focus—in respect to trade facilitation—
in regards to the regulatory aspects of cross-border trade they gen -
erally miss the operational aspects such as the physical movement 
of goods and B2B processes, critical to ensure a seamless movement 
of cross-border trade.  Port community systems provide that vital 
operational information and act as gateways for the trade into single 
windows. The IPCSA, in its previous European role, issued a publica -
tion titled, “Port Community Systems as Gateways to National Single 
Window.”22
PORT COMMUNITY SYSTEMS FACILITATE THE SUPPLY 
CHAIN AND HINTERLAND CONNECTIONS
82. Ports also function as modality exchange nodes, where maritime 
transport, road, barge, and rail transport converge. The manage-
ment of the maritime traffic requires a considerable amount of effort. 
In addition, the ports must manage properly the negative impact of 
their operations on the landside, such as long queues of trucks waiting 
in ports before they can collect their cargo or containers. Some ports 
have implemented an appointment system, which increases the reliabil-
ity and efficiency of landside operations. These systems are frequently 
complemented with IoT sensors at port entry gates and all the infor-
mation gathered is combined with AI to predict road traffic in the port 
vicinity to better manage traffic in and out of the port. Thus, a PCS lies 
at the heart of the system required to ensure ports operate effectively.
83.  Many ports are looking to strengthen their competitive posi-
tions by extending to the hinterland. Often, ports and some port ter -
minals promote inland terminals connected via rail, road, and barge 
to and from their maritime port. Inland terminals offer services similar 
to those offered by  maritime terminals and port community systems 
facilitate the interconnection between both areas and give access to 
those services. At the same time, PCSs extend the traceability of the 
supply chain from port to the hinterland, and vice versa. Multimodal -
ity solutions are promoted for cargo transport from and to seaports, 
to reduce the congestion and improve efficiency in the port area. 
Consequently, PCSs play an essential role in timing and scheduling of 
multimodal transport solutions. NOTE

Portic (IPCSA)HOW SHOULD A PORT AUTHORITY DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A PCS? 
Figure 3.5. Port Community Systems: The Twelve Actions84.  In 2015, the IPCSA published a guide, How to Develop a Port 
Community System (IPCSA 2015), which identified twelve key steps 
to establish a PCS. The guide illustrates for organizations—whether 
they be sea or airport authorities, customs authorities, government 
departments or agencies, or users of sea, air, and inland ports—the 
key steps, or actions, in developing a PCS suited to the environment in 
which they operate, while solving business bottlenecks or delays that 
create inefficiencies at sea, air and inland ports (see figure 3.5).
CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN6385.  In addition to the twelve actions, five additional factors should 
be considered when developing a PCS.  These include (a) human capi -
tal, (b) governance and operating models, (c) international standards, 
(d) technology considerations, and (e) ongoing development and 
maintenance. Each factor is discussed in the following paragraphs.
86.  One of the most crucial factors in the implementation of 
the PCS is human capital and community engagement.  Generally, 
around 40 types of stakeholders could use the PCS services; these 
stakeholders would then form the port community. The PCS serves 
entities such as government agencies (customs, border agencies, 
phytosanitary authorities, for example), trade (shipping lines, freight 
forwarders, agents, trucking companies, customs brokers, shippers, 
importers, and others), terminals, port authorities and the services 
they provide, such as vessel traffic management. These represent 
only a few examples of the stakeholders involved, and during the 
development stage a mapping of all stakeholders lays a crucial foun -
dation for developing a successful PCS.
 
87.  Human capital is the biggest barrier to development, imple -
mentation, and sustainable operation of a successful PCS.  The per -
formance of the PCS largely depends on the capacity, collaboration, 
and participation of the port community members. These collabora -
tions, whether physical, informational, or financial, are interdependent 
and thus create many coordination dependencies. Therefore, change 
management, incorporating strong stakeholder engagement, is 
essential to ensure the success of the development process.  
88.  Selecting optimal governance and operating models ensures 
the sustainability of a PCS. If the governance or operating model is 
wrong, system failure is likely. However, the selection of the optimal 
model can be challenging, as it depends on the culture, environment, 
and even politics associated with the port and the country itself. The 
key criteria for the governance and operating models are neutrali -
ty and trust. A PCS needs to be a neutral and trusted third party; if 
it is not considered trustworthy or neutral, the likelihood of failure 
increases. In terms of ownership, three main options include the 
following:
• Private ownership: This is a bottom-up approach, in that the pri -
vate operators such as shipping lines, terminal operators, freight 
forwarders, brokers, and others own and operate the system. 
Privately owned systems are easy to implement and are more The performance of 
the port communi-
ty systems largely 
depends on the 
capacity, collabo-
ration, and partic-
ipation of the port 
community membersACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION64flexible in their operations; however, they are still connected to 
government agencies, including customs, to effectively combine 
B2B and B2G processes for the benefit of the entire community. 
Some major ports, particularly in Europe, such as Maritime Cargo 
Processing plc (United Kingdom), and dbh Logistics and DAKOSY 
(Germany), adopt this approach.
• Public ownership:  Port authorities are instrumental in the 
development of PCS and in many countries they are also the main 
shareholders. In countries with proactive participation of nation -
al public authorities, public ownership models are quite preva -
lent—for example: Portbase Rotterdam (the Netherlands); Polski 
PCS (Poland); ePuertoBilbao (Spain); Port of Trieste (Italy); Port St. 
Maarten (Caribbean); Djibouti PCS (Djibouti); and Port of Antwerp 
(Belgium).
• Mixed public-private partnership:  The mixed public-private part -
nership program aims to achieve a full acceptance and/or an active 
participation of private companies in top-down PCS implementa -
tion. These mixed systems could vary in type and extent of involve -
ment of various stakeholders and can range from a public-private 
partnership PCS with SOGET and MGI (France) to national trade 
single windows that incorporate PCS, such as Portnet (Morocco), 
SEGUCE RDC (Democratic Republic of Congo), and SEGUCE TOGO 
(Togo), to concessions for services, such as Portic (Barcelona). 
89.  In terms of the operating models, key decisions include wheth -
er it will be provided free or a fee will be charged, who will pay, and 
what type of services will be offered.  The level of capital costs and 
the source and level of operating costs must also be considered. The 
answers to these questions and others will be very much context 
specific, and depend on the local environment and ownership model, 
and need to be agreed between all stakeholders, ex ante, or early in 
the process.
90.  The development of any PCS should be based on accepted 
international standards.  There may be more than one required stan -
dard and the PCS acts as a translator from one standard or format 
to another. Therefore, a review of standards used by the industry 
and the government agencies will ensure that in any development 
of digitalization, the process will not place a burden on the trade 
and other agencies who might need to invest large amounts to 
change standards. Recommended standards to review include those The development of 
any port community 
system should be 
based on accepted 
international stan-
dards. There may 
be more than one 
required standard 
and the PCS acts as 
a translator from 
one standard or 
format to another.CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN65developed by UNCEFACT (EDIFACT—messages used by a majority of 
shipping lines and the multi modal reference data model); PROTECT 
(messages for port authorities); SMDG (messages for terminals and 
shipping lines); WCO (customs data reference model); and the IMO 
FAL reference data model. Traditionally, PCS have exchanged (batch) 
messages, but as technology moves forward, interfaces such as APIs 
are being used. This means the underlying reference data models 
are critical for PCS interoperability with all users, enabling the PCS to 
translate from one standard to another.
91.  Creating technology neutral solutions where possible is also 
recommended. Technology should not drive business and processes, 
but business should assess which processes should be digitalized and 
what the most appropriate technology should be. This technology 
neutrality brings the user freedom to choose the most appropriate 
and suitable technology for the user’s need while also standardizing 
the underlying data. Varying technologies can thus be chosen to low -
er end costs for users and government agencies and authorities alike. 
Accordingly, technology-neutral solutions allow  a PCS to be future 
proofed and adapted for ongoing development and maintenance as 
well as updated efficiently to comply with national and international 
legislation.
92.  Once built, a PCS must be flexible to allow change and adapt 
to new needs and requirements.  Possible changes could include 
updates to local, national, regional, or international legislations as well 
as to the business trends affecting the movement of goods or the 
process flow of information. Innovation should also be part of a PCS 
culture—innovating and adapting not just to technology, but to the 
greater PCS community and user requirements as well. Just because 
a PCS has worked in the past and is working now does not mean it

Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and the call for action urging ports to accelerate their role as 
digital nodes in the supply chain, some smaller and medium-sized ports were actively considering, 
developing, implementing, and, in some cases, already operating port community systems. 
Although the principles of a PCS are the same for every size port, in the Caribbean, Indian Ocean, and 
Pacific, some small islands have been successfully implementing PCS for the past two decades. Howev -
er, some smaller ports could have different drivers and varying levels of financial resources and human 
capital available to develop and operate a PCS. They may face additional challenges in the smaller ports 
(particularly in the Smaller Island Developing States) in terms of the quality of the internet and the reli -
ability of the power supply—so while larger ports can more easily enable their operations, improve their 
efficiency, and enhance their competitiveness through digitalization, other ports struggle to implement 
the initial steps in designing and implementing a PCS. 
One promising avenue currently under discussion is the development of a suitably modular PCS, based 
on open source software, which can be tailored to meet the context and needs of the smaller ports.

Chapter 4: The Medium-Term 
RecommendationsACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION68
4.1 Introduction
93. Chapter 4 presents the next steps and medium-term recom-
mendations in the development of port community ecosystems and 
the digitization and resilience of the sector. These steps include 
the development and introduction of a port management system 
(PMS) and the introduction of smart port technologies, all of which 
improve the resilience of the maritime logistic chain. The equally 
urgent requirements related to improving digital security are dealt 
with in chapter 5. “Medium term” is defined here as between 12 and 
24 months, a recommended timeline to underline the urgency of the 
agenda and intended as an aspiration rather than a definitive timeline. 
4.2 Port Management System
94.  A PMS enables the port authority to control traffic and man-
age port infrastructure in the port. As illustrated in figure 4.1, a PMS 
encompasses the management of port calls, dues, journal, incidents, 
waste, dangerous goods, planner, cargo, inspections, permits, ser -
vices, security, and assets in an integrated manner via one system. 
This covers a far broader agenda than that of a port community 
system (PCS), as introduced in the previous chapter, which is intended 
to facilitate movement of the consignment through the port into and 
from the hinterland. A PMS, which focuses on the regulatory mission 
of the port authority, includes those tasks as well, while also encom -
passing all other activities required for the port to function and thus is 
a major factor in the relative competitiveness of any port.CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN69Figure 4.1. Port Management System
95.  Modern port management requires a performing PMS that 
supports and enables efficient traffic control.  In the case of the Port 
of Antwerp, Belgium, the information technology (IT) department 
developed the Antwerp Port Information and Control System (APICS). 
This PMS deals with all relevant aspects of managing shipping traffic 
to, from, and within the port boundary, including tug activities, lock 
planning, berth management, and registration of dangerous goods. 
An intelligent platform, the APICS is the main working solution of 
traffic controllers, dock masters, quay supervisors, harbor masters, 
dangerous goods operatives, port dues collectors, tug operators, 
pilots, Shipping & Signalling Services (SSS), the Agency for Maritime 
and Coastal Services (MDK), and the shipping police. 
96.  The PMS also assists traffic control in drawing up the optimal 
planning for vessels arriving in or leaving the port with minimal 
delays. The PMS provides an accurate and actual image of the port 
and her approach routes, the bridges and locks, and all vessels sailing 
or moored in the port’s working area. All operational events are cap -
tured electronically if (and as soon as) possible, minimizing latency. In 
the context of the Port of Antwerp, the coordinating departments and 
services have correct, up-to-date information for handling the flow of 
seagoing ships and barge traffic. The PMS forms the core operating ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION70system as it has to manage more than 35,000 vessel voyages and up 
to 300,000 barge movements on a yearly basis. With the introduction 
of the APICS PMS, the Port Authority of Antwerp has moved away 
from a previous, and rather passive, version of the system focused 
on recording and monitoring of shipping movements, to an active 
system in which users are able to optimize their planning processes.
 
97.  Ship’s agents and forwarders, pilotage and tugging companies, 
shipping police and customs, port dues officials, and other logistics 
players in the supply chain all make intensive use of the APICS desk.  
Currently, more than 320 companies use APICS, with about 2,400 
active users. Internally, APICS serves as the main tool for vessel traffic 
controllers, lock operators, dock masters and port state control, har -
bor masters, and dangerous goods operatives. The system guaran -
tees a smooth, safe, cost-efficient and customer-oriented follow-up of 
all traffic flows from, to, and in the Port of Antwerp. The APICS system 
is instrumental to the organization and coordination of all ship move -
ments (inbound/outbound/shifting), lock planning and berth manage -
ment, and coordination of the dredging operations. 
98.  The Port of Antwerp’s APICS PMS is connected to various exter -
nal, public, and private partners.  A direct linkage between the central 
broker system hub model and the port’s own operational systems 
means that only one application is needed for uniform communica -
tion. This ensures transparency of information and promotes a rapid 
and up-to-date flow of information. The PMS uses the latest tech -
nology to coordinate bridge and lock scheduling with the schedules 
of various service providers (pilots, tug operators, boatmen, waste 
collectors, among others). In terms of the regulatory messages, the 
APICS PMS (the online user interface is called C-Point) is used to con -
vey the following communications (among others), as listed online at: 
https://www.c-point.be/en/services :
• Prenotification (seagoing ship) —used by the shipping compa -
ny or ship’s agent to provide advanced information to the harbor 
master’s office on a seagoing ship due to enter or leave the port.
• Order for pilot, tug, or mooring services —used to inform the 
harbor master’s office quickly and easily of any additional services 
that a ship will need, before it enters the port.Modern port man-
agement requires a

agement System that 
supports and enables 
efficient traffic controlCRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN71• Notification of arrival (seagoing ship) —used by the port author -
ity to notify the customs authorities, via APICS, when a seagoing 
ship bound for Antwerp actually moors at the berth.
• Notification of dangerous goods —used by the ship’s agent or 
freight forwarder to notify the harbor master’s office, at least 24 
hours in advance, about the position of dangerous goods.
• ISPS declaration —submitted electronically by ships wishing to 
call at an European Union port; under the terms of the Interna -
tional Ship and Port Facility Security Code (ISPS Code), ships must 
provide certain information to the relevant authorities in the form 
of an ISPS declaration.
• Notification of exit (seagoing ship) —used by the port authority 
to inform the customs authorities, via APICS, when a seagoing ship 
unmoors from its berth and leaves the port via the lock.
4.3 The Evolution towards a Smart Port
99.  A smart port is an automated port that uses nascent technolo -
gies such as big data, internet of things (IoT), fifth-generation tech -
nology (5G), blockchain solutions, and other smart technology-based 
methods to improve performance and economic competitiveness. 
With these technologies, smart ports can also improve environmental 
sustainability. In an ideal smart port, processes would be automated 
and connected via IoT. This section introduces a smart port technolo -
gies use case with a focus on distributed ledger technologies, such as 
blockchain, digital twin, IoT, 5G, and artificial intelligence (AI). 
Distributed ledger technologies: Blockchain
100. Blockchain, one of the major Fourth Industrial Revolution 
technologies, enables real-time tracking and management of logis-
tics activities and asset locations within the supply chain and safe 
sharing of data among related parties. Many ports are now exploring 
the new business opportunity with blockchain, which could be a game 
changer for organizing the logistics processes with risk and owner-
ship transfer—without the use of traditional documents, but rather 
through data sovereignty. Box 4.1 provides an example of the intro-
duction of such technologies in the Port of Busan, Republic of Korea.
ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION72Box 4.1Box 4.1. Example of Blockchain Technologies Implemented in the Port of Busan
The Port of Busan, in the Republic of Korea, is the sixth busiest container port and the second busiest 
transhipment port in the world (based on 2019 volume). It also serves as a gateway port for Northeast 
Asia, handling more than 20 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) per year since 2017. The Port of 
Busan consists of two ports: North Port and New Port, with each port operating three and six terminals 
respectively.
The Development and Future Directions of PCS at Busan Port  
The ship arrival and departure work was computerized in 1996 as part of the digital public service 
system, called Port–MIS (management information system). As the first-generation port community 
system (PCS) in Korea, Port–MIS handled all the port operation and civil service-related works, including 
arrival reporting, port facility usage, traffic control information, cargo terminal gate-in/out, port dues, 
and departure reporting, among other tasks in major Korean ports. However, the data accuracy of 
Port–MIS was inadequate, as it was based on the information reported by shipping lines. When chang -
es occurred in ship arrival and departure schedules, gate-in/out, circumstances, or other operations, 
shipping lines sometimes omitted or failed to update the modified information in time. 
BPA–NET , the second-generation PCS, partially addressed such an issue. It offered improved data 
reliability by reflecting electronic data interchange (EDI) information into the data reported by shipping 
lines, and added a function to create statistics generated within the Port of Busan based on the collect -
ed data. However, data reliability was still limited, as it relied on faithful, accurate reporting, and there 
remained an issue created by unintegrated container information. The average truck turn-around time 
of the terminals stood at approximately 20 minutes (see figure B4.1.1), which was better than other 
ports in the world in terms of efficiency; however, the lack of accurate data created the following issues: 
• Cargo gate-in/out was concentrated at certain times, creating congestion and operational inefficien -
cies in terminals. 
• Longer truck waiting time resulted in fewer containers transported, and not surprisingly, this ineffi -
cient use of trucks inevitably led to a decrease in revenue for trucking companies and truck drivers. 
• Inefficient truck assignments also led to decreased backhauling and logistics efficiency, increas -
ing trucking cost and creating the need to improve terminal operation efficiency and preserve or 
increase profits. CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN73Box 4.1 continuesMoreover, dispersed data at terminals—due to lack of real-time data sharing between shipping lines, ter -
minals, and trucking companies—led to number of issues, for example: Trucking companies experienced 
difficulties in allocating trucks, while terminal operators had trouble establishing and operating a yard 
plan and experienced inefficiencies resulting from a lack of integrated data, such as the length of time 
needed to verify data errors. 
Chain Portal, the third-generation PCS used in the Port of Busan, is based on the real-time data collec -
tion made possible with blockchain. It consists of the vehicle booking system, including the interterminal 
transport system, the integrated terminal monitoring system, and big data, among other components.

Source: Port of Busan, Republic of KoreaThe major strength of Chain Portal, as compared to the previous PCS, is the use of blockchain (see 
table B4.1.1), which provides improved work efficiency to stakeholders by increasing data reliability and 
enabling real-time monitoring of container status. For shipping lines, it provides an environment to 
improve their work efficiency. Through real-time monitoring of container status and real-time provision 
of statistics information, shipping lines can respond immediately when container transport-related issues 
occur. For terminal operators, the system improves terminal operation productivity by allowing them 
to establish effective workforce and yard operation plans and to minimize container relocation work, all 
based on the scheduled gate-in/out information (scheduled transport and trucking information, for exam -
ple). Blockchain is also expected to reduce port emissions by minimizing unnecessary works. 
Moreover, the addition of an integrated terminal information search service for trucking companies  
shortens the time to collect information necessary for vehicle assignment (berth status, container track -
ing, yard status, and other terminal-related information). The improved search service should reduce 
transport errors based on the real-time information checking and verification, thus improving the work 
efficiency of trucking companies. To better serve truck drivers, the underdogs among stakeholders, 
mobile transhipment (T/S) transport platforms operated separately by each of nine terminal operators 
were integrated into one platform (reduced from nine platforms to one). This integration will improve 
drivers’ working environment and profit by cutting turn-around time and increasing vehicle turnover rate 
(figure B4.1.2).

CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN75Box 4.1 continuesHowever, the advent of Chain Portal may pose a negative impact on the business model of relay network 
businesses (value-added network service providers) that have been profiting through Port–MIS. This issue 
remains to be addressed. 
The Introduction of Chain Portal
In 2018, the Busan Port Authority started a pilot project to establish a blockchain platform, with the first 
phase of Chain Portal beginning in 2019 and ending in March 2020. The project included various systems 
to enhance vehicle assignment environment, such as a group vehicle assignment system, an integrated 
terminal information search system, and integrated terminal operator mobile applications. 
From August 2020 to February 2021, the second phase of Chain Portal Project will be implemented. 
The project will include establishment of a vehicle booking system (VBS) and advancement of block -
chain-based transport system. After the use of Chain Portal is stabilized in the Port of Busan, it will be 
applied to other domestic ports in Korea starting from 2022 (see figure B4.1.3).

101.  Working with scale models has been a common practice 
during the past century.  In order to study certain behavior of an orig -
inal object without examining the original object itself, researchers  
began building models “to scale,” with accurate relationships between 
all important aspects of the original object. The concept of work -
ing with scale models has found its way into many fields, including 
engineering, architecture, military command, and many others. While 
each field may use a scale model for a different purpose, to function 
properly, all scale models are based on the same principles and must 
meet the same general requirements.
102.  Today, in the digital era, the fast-evolving gaming industry 
and the growing computing power have allowed scale models to 
be developed in a virtual environment, leading to the conception of 
digital twins. As seen in the analog scale models, the digital twin rep -
licates actual physical assets, with the added functionality of integrat -
ing processes, people, systems, and devices. Digital twins have three 
important characteristics: (a) the physical model and corresponding 
virtual model are connected; (b) this connection is established by 
generating real-time data from multiple sources, using sensors to 
represent its near real-time status in working condition or position; 
and (c) the digital visualization provides both the elements and the 
dynamics of how an IoT device operates and lives throughout its life 
cycle. These digital twin system characteristics can be represented in 
five technical dimensions:
• Data and analytics—forming the core of the system
• Visual interface—ranging from simple 2D to full-blown 3D models
• Simulation and physical modeling—replicating the physical model 
in detail
• Situational awareness—providing real time feed on events hap -
pening at a certain location
• Automated systems—ensuring all model processes are automated
103.  In short, a digital twin is an exact visual copy brought to life 
by feeding real-time data streams into the model and integrating 
these interacting streams in such a way that the model comes alive.  
From a port perspective, the advantages of working with a digital 
twin (see example in figure 4.2, with the digital twin shown at left) are 
numerous, allowing real-time overview of operations, insight into the 
actual spatial context, and overall situational awareness when con -
nected with the operational process information.The digital twin 
replicates actual 
physical assets, with 
the added function-
ality of integrating 
processes, people, 
systems, and devices.CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN77Figure 4.2. Example of a Digital Twin: Port of Antwerp
104.  The Port of Antwerp handles a huge amount of digital data.  
Frequently, however, the data take the form of separate systems, with 
real-time information concerning the port area available to a limited 
number of users. By integrating all data into one digital twin, near -
ly all departments within the port community can benefit from the 
visual user experience, as graphics help users understand complex ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION78situations at a glance. The vessel traffic management information ser -
vices (VTMISs) are the most obvious users of this digital system; how -
ever, the environmental department also uses the visual display of 
measurements and analysis generated by, for example, the electronic 
air quality sensors that detect degassing of ships, while the digital 
twin offers the mobility team a port-wide mobility heat map, and the 
financial department can generate a one-click graphical depiction of 
terminal level revenues and port dues.
105.  A digital twin can be used for real-time monitoring and 
reporting purposes, and is also instrumental in examining future 
events. The model archives and analyzes past data, which allows 
event simulation in certain, and programmable, conditions. The Port 
of Antwerp’s digital twin continues to mature as the influx of data 
gradually increases and is fed into the system. This includes data 
gathered from windmills, drone air pathways, and automated aerial 
systems that detect oil spills and emergency situations involving peo -
ple, such as drowning incidents. In total, more than 90 use cases have 
been identified for further integration into the digital twin, thereby 
creating the foundation for a port-wide digital nervous system and 
the basis for an advanced AI-enabled port management system with -
in three to five years.
106.  Digital twin systems take time to build, and spring from 
successfully combining existing assets and measurements with 
new, innovative tools and futureproof technology.  In order to avoid 
overcomplicating things, the system plan must have the correct 
basics in place from the beginning. The first step involves an inventory 
and analysis of actual data streams to identify the correct and most 
useful data generated by automated detection and registration. The 
extended set of geographical information present in the port forms 
the system’s base layer, and includes land use, concessions, pipelines, 
powerlines, bollards, quay walls, buildings, and so on. The initial phase 
must have a stable, secure, and automated registration of events in 
the port environment. Data generated by the PMS or PCS make the 
ideal starting point, as these systems generate highly relevant and 
reliable real-time data and are able to feed these data into the digital 
twin. Other interesting data that could be integrated into the system 
include weather conditions, status of bridges and locks, and mobility 
measurements. All these data are very dynamic, contextual, and once 
integrated into the model they help bring the digital twin to life. Cur -
rently, approximately 12 different databases have been integrated via 
a data lake enabled by an application programming interface (API). Digital twin systems 
take time to build, 
so in order to avoid 
overcomplicating 
things, the system 
plan must have the 
correct basics in place 
from the beginning.CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN79107.  Another fundamental asset in developing a properly function -
ing digital twin is the presence of a digital nervous system through -
out the port area. In Antwerp, a high-performing fiber network allows 
devices and sensors to connect to the digital twin, either physically or 
through the air, including cranes, cameras, and traffic lights. By grad -
ually integrating more data into the digital twin, the Port of Antwerp is 
becoming a digitally futureproof port. In turn, this digitization project 
is instrumental in reaching higher levels of service and improved 
operational and managerial efficiency—with a positive effect on sus -
tainability, and a more efficient and economical use of resources and 
assets. For example, automatic measurement of road surface wear 
and tear allows better planning of maintenance works, which then 
helps improve local air quality. 
108. The presence of a digital nervous system and development of 
the digital twin have had mutually reinforcing powers, leading to the 
inception of the Antwerp Port Information and Control Assistant (API-
CA). A digital assistant that combines the skin of the digital twin and 
the power of integrated data, APICA increases insights into fact-based 
simulations of operational decisions and their consequences. As they 
unlock the predictive capacities of the system, the advanced data-an-
alytics and AI functionalities will expand the power of APICA. The com-
bination of multiple real-time data streams will result in a cross-pol-
lination, generating new insights to improve port-area management 
and development. APICA represents the next step in the Antwerp Port 
Authority’s objective to have a user friendly, fully integrated system 
managing day-to-day port operations. APICA will provide port author-
ity staff with full situational awareness, as the system will indicate any 
anomality occurring in the port’s ecosystem, and in this way help the 
Port of Antwerp staff make better and faster decisions. 
109.  The development and rollout of 5G mobile broadband has the 
potential to not only support, but also accelerate these revolutionary 
changes. Fifth-generation technology presents a variety of benefits 
over previous generations of wireless connectivity, including greater 
bandwidth, lower latency, capacity to dedicate resources for critical 
functions, potential for greatly expanded numbers of devices, and 
easier sharing of data. In some cases, we see dramatic and exponen -
tial gains from previous technologies. Each of these 5G features will 
have an impact in the transport sector, contributing to transport-spe -
cific applications. Of these, three key opportunities present them -
selves: (a) revolutionary advancements in the potential connectivity of 
vehicles, (b) an increase in the number and prevalence of connected 5G mobile technology 
presents a variety of 
benefits over previ-
ous generations of 
wireless connectivity, 
including greater 
bandwidth, lower 
latency, capacity to 
dedicate resources 
for critical functions, 
potential for greatly 
expanded numbers 
of devices, and eas-
ier sharing of data.ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION80devices, and (c) improved data availability for transport operations 
and management. Undoubtedly, digital transport solutions will evolve 
and entirely new opportunities become more viable in the maritime 
sector as well as across the wider transport sector. 
110. The 5G technology incorporates three fundamental dimen-
sions for increasing logistics efficiency. On the one hand, 5G enables 
the operation of autonomous vehicles, either by land, by sea, or by air. 
On the other hand, 5G simplifies many communications and signaling 
processes, and includes a simplified radio configuration, known as 
5G New Radio, which is precisely designed to reduce costs (US$5 per 
device) and increase device battery life up to 10 years. 5G is specially 
designed for massive machine-type communications, facilitating the 
IoT on a large scale. This capacity, within logistics management, will 
allow for locating all containers, pallets, packages, or other transport 
units throughout the distribution chain. The on-demand transporta-
tion service enabled by this live-tracking of goods and transport unit 
requires the maximum penetration of third-party logistics (3PL) play-
ers, which are typically not well introduced in developing countries. 
Because of their capacity to adapt their equipment and systems quick-
ly, 3PL should prioritize bringing 5G technologies into the logistics 
field. Finally, the impact of autonomous vehicles might be seen first in 
the logistics sector, as long-haul trucking presents one of the simplest 
and most controlled contexts for autonomous vehicle application.
111. In the port sector, two initial 5G tests have been implemented 
in the port of Rotterdam (the Netherlands) and Bari (Italy). The test 
in Rotterdam focused on the massive deployment of wireless sensors, 
allowing for real-time monitoring of movement of goods and produc-
tion of industrial processes in the port. To increase sensor reliability, a 
5G network operating at 700 megahertz (MHz) and 3,500 MHz bands 
in dual band was deployed in the port. The test included analysis of 
the role of ultra-high definition video surveillance, alongside AI, in 
detecting and managing cargo loading and unloading. Results indicat-
ed maintenance was better predicted, and the additional information 
allowed inspectors near automatic failure detection. Finally, unmanned 
robots were used to inspect gas leaks. In addition to making the pro-
cess safer, substituting the human process with a machine-assisted 
process increased the inspection’s accuracy and reliability.1NOTE

Bari will be explored further in the forthcom-

Chapter 5: Cybersecurity 
toward Cyber ResilienceACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION825.1 Introduction
112.  In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks, an 
overarching emphasis was placed on enhancing physical security 
capabilities in port facilities and vessels.  The physical security reg -
ulations described within the International Maritime Organization’s 
(IMO) International Ship and Port Security (ISPS) Code further codified 
minimum protections for port facilities and vessels. While numer -
ous ports hardened their security postures in attaining ISPS Code 
compliance, the ISPS Code is already outdated in the face of the past 
decade’s explosion of integrated technological advancements. Suc -
cessfully sustaining effective security in increasingly digitized smart 
port environments now demands integrating cybersecurity 1 practices 
into traditional physical security methods. 
113.  Many of the digital developments in the port sector were 
designed and deployed without considering cybersecurity.  Port lead -
ers entering the smart port age face increasingly complex decisions 
regarding investments in new technologies, such as big data, 2 the 
internet of things (IoT), 3 artificial intelligence (AI), and digital currency 
exchanges to improve operational performance, enhance automated 
processes, and increase competitiveness. These capabilities are key 
building blocks of smart port environments. However, smart ports 
have an Achilles heel: Many of these platforms were designed and 
have been deployed without security in mind. In box 5.1, the Port of 
Antwerp case study illustrates these potential security risks.

Box 5.1Box 5.1. Case Study: Antwerp—Underscoring the Cyberphysical Security
In 2011, Belgian authorities grew suspicious when containers were discovered abandoned outside the 
Port of Antwerp. The reason: from 2011 through 2013 a Netherlands-based organized crime syndicate 
had recruited hackers to breach port information technology (IT) systems that managed container 
movements. Their objective was to hide narcotics among legitimate cargoes, including containers of 
timber and bananas shipped from South America. With the hackers’ assistance, the criminals accessed 
the release codes for targeted containers and gained advance knowledge of when and where to send a 
truck to intercept a container before the legitimate owner arrived. 
How did this happen? First, hackers launched a commonly used “phishing” attack, sending innocent-look-
ing malware-infected emails to employees at various terminal operators in the port. Hackers then gained 
remote access to port data systems and from there accessed cargo management systems and, specifi-
cally, container release codes. Although the initial breach was discovered and the malware removed, this 
did not stop the criminals—who then modified their tactics and physically broke into the port to install 
key-logging devices on computer systems. Through Wi-Fi connectivity, hackers again gained access to 
the targeted computer networks, collecting the keystrokes of targeted personnel. The data collected 
included usernames and passwords to key systems. Using this information, hackers quickly regained 
access to key systems to continue their smuggling activities. Lesson learned: Traditional investments in 
supporting ISPS Code compliance did not deliver effective integrated security to port stakeholders.

114.  For port operators functioning in today’s IoT-enabled world, 
ISPS Code compliance does not equate to cybersecurity. The IoT’s 
hyperinterconnectedness impacts every port authority, commercial 
maritime organization, government agency, and individual relying on 
digital networks, networked systems and applications, cloud-based 
technologies, and mobile devices. Connected port communities—
often serving as the critical foundations supporting entire national 
economies—are increasingly vulnerable to attack tactics exploiting 
the vulnerabilities that arise from the integration of digital cyberphys -
ical systems. 
115.  While IoT-enabled technologies offer significant potential 
operational efficiencies to port stakeholders, they also introduce 
new vulnerabilities that open the door to cyberthreats.  The evolution 
of cyber-enabled platforms, systems, and processes, which are gain -
ing additional momentum with the introduction of predictive analytics 
software, AI, and IoT devices, is occurring at an extraordinary rate, 
challenging longstanding security postures. Adapting to such rapid 
change requires port stakeholders to learn new vocabularies and ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION84terminologies and gain fresh insights into the cyberphysical threat 
landscape. More importantly, they must understand how cyberphys -
ical threats can impact their organizations, analyze and reevaluate 
decision-making responsibilities and authorities, employ new training 
strategies, plan for and prepare to respond to possibly debilitating 
incidents, and understand how to effectively communicate within their 
organizations and externally among their port community partners, 
customers, and key stakeholders.
116.  In the emerging digital and automated era for ports, com -
monly termed the “smart port” generation, a growing number of 
port authorities—with the goal of improving service across supply 
chains—are coordinating the implementation of new digital tech -
nology solutions to deliver connectivity, visibility, and control.  While 
digitalization and automation of maritime trade, logistics, transport, 
and cargo handling have been underway in various guises for many 
decades now, the trend has clearly accelerated in the past few years 
and has ramped up substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
This has consequently increased the cyberattack surface and enticed 
threat actors. As such, the need for cybersecurity is more vital now 
than ever. According to London-based company Astaara, there has 
been a fourfold increase in cyberattacks in the maritime industry 
since February 2020. The Port of Los Angeles, the busiest container 
port in the United States, has seen a 50 percent increase in unautho -
rized intrusion attempts since the beginning of the pandemic. Other 
ports around the globe also report increased cyberthreat activity.
 
117.  Although nearly 10 years have elapsed since the Port of Ant -
werp attack, it carries wide implications for port communities world -
wide, insofar as it represents a convergence of multiple threats, 
tactics, and paradigms. Even more importantly, the lessons learned 
from the attack remain valid. Key implications include the following:
• Convergence of cyber and physical threats.  This attack involved 
the coordinated use and combined application of cyber and 
physical tactics and techniques. The attackers collaborated in their 
planning, targeting, application, use, and access of key data and 
information, using the hacked knowledge to assist the physical 
theft of shipping containers. This represents a critical evolution in 
the tactics and strategies threat actors are likely to employ against 
port communities in the future, as threat actors are able to aggres-
sively maintain their persistence over years.While digitalization 
and automation 
of maritime trade, 
logistics, transport, 
and cargo handling 
have been underway 
in various guises for 
many decades now, 
the trend has clearly 
accelerated in the 
past few years and 
has ramped up sub-
stantially during the 
COVID-19 pandemic.CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN85• Collaboration of organized crime and hackers. The attack resulted 
from the convergence of a sophisticated organized crime syn -
dicate and technically adept hackers. After the port discovered 
and mitigated the initial intrusion, the criminals changed tactics 
and physically broke into the terminal facilities to install snooping 
devices on administrative computer networks—which represents a 
cyberbreach—to continue their smuggling operations.
• Local law enforcement versus transnational crime. Because the 
Port of Antwerp attack involved multiple terminal operators within 
a port community, connected to ships, shippers, logistics provid -
ers, and various government entities, the vulnerability presented a 
transnational concern. Since criminals were able to smuggle drugs 
from South America into the European Union, the vulnerability 
extended to the entire international trading ecosystem the Port of 
Antwerp supports, spanning clients, partners, and governments. 
Integrated cyberphysical threats are pernicious and managing 
port community risk requires the awareness of all industry stake -
holders as well as communication and coordination with relevant 
local, regional, national, and transnational law enforcement agen -
cies. Collaboration is critical.
118.  The Port of Antwerp attack illustrates how weaknesses in one 
area of an organization’s security capability can exploit the vulner -
abilities that may exist in other areas of an organization’s cyber, 
physical, or electronic security capabilities, and vice versa.  Because 
of the converged nature of the cyberphysical risk spectrum, it is 
crucial that port community leaders consider an integrated approach 
to planning and implementing digitalized security for their operating 
environments. Maritime organizations should carefully assess their 
security capabilities, processes, and internal operations for potential 
weaknesses and seek to understand how a weakness in one area of 
the operation might serve as an entry point and subsequent step -
ping-stone to more sensitive areas. 
119.  Further, the Port of Antwerp’s experience is not unique, and is 
not limited to the port, but instead provides a case study reminding 
port community members they do not operate in isolation.  Every 
port community (and its members) operates within the same global 
ecosystem in which data are regularly exchanged among numerous 
groups, spanning shipping lines, carrier agents, terminal operators, 
freight forwarders, road haulage, train operators, border control and 
inspection, port state control, and customs authorities. Because of the con-
verged nature of the 
cyberphysical risk 
spectrum, it is crucial 
that port community 
leaders consider an 
integrated approach 
to planning and 
implementing dig-
italized security 
for their operating 
environments.ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION86120.  Port community members make attractive targets for cyber-
threat actors in part because so many stakeholders and networks 
operate within this environment—many with technologies poorly 
configured against cyberthreats or unsupported legacy systems.  
Cyberthreat actors try to exploit port facilities as a one-to-many cyber -
threat vector to port community stakeholders, potentially exposing 
third parties operating in the terminal environment, including termi -
nal operators, port authorities, customs officials, chandlering compa -
nies, agents, vendor representatives, and many others. In this sense, 
digitalization, which is discussed in chapter 6, brings both the benefits 
of increased efficiency and the costs of heightened security risks.
121.  Increasingly, port facilities are adopting and integrating a 
broad range of physical and electronic security systems, along with 
operational technologies—both wired and wireless—to facilitate 
more efficient and streamlined operations. These efforts are giving 
rise to faster cargo movements through port environments. The more 
network-enabled devices deployed to this end, the more port com -
munities—and the maritime industry overall—become vulnerable to 
exploitation by a wide range of cyberphysical (or “converged”) threats.
 
122.  Locally, port networks need to ensure data are both avail -
able and accurate.  For example, a threat actor gaining unauthorized 
access to a terminal operating system (TOS) could misdirect cargo 
container assignments, change bill of lading data to minimize the 
possibility of customs inspections to enable smuggling, or modify 
scheduling information to facilitate illicit (but authorized) physical 
entry to a facility. Compromised video monitoring systems can also be 
manipulated to deceive security personnel and enable threat actors 
to gain entry to restricted areas. Such cyberphysical vulnerabilities 
can lead to ISPS Code failures. Unfortunately, threat actors frequently 
exploit these vulnerabilities, and the results span business disruption, 
property loss, loss of life and injury, environmental damage, liability 
exposure, and reputational damage.Cyberthreat actors try 
to exploit port facili-
ties as a one-to-many 
cyberthreat vector 
to port community 
stakeholders, poten-
tially exposing third 
parties operating in 
the terminal envi-
ronment, including 
terminal operators, 
port authorities, 
customs officials, 
chandlering compa-
nies, agents, vendor 
representatives, 
and many others.CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN87THE CONVERGENCE OF OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY, 
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, AND IOT
123.  One factor driving both the evolution and complexity of cyber -
physical threats is the convergence of, and in many cases connectivi -
ty among, the following:
• Information technology-based (IT) systems, such as access control, 
enterprise resource planning applications, TOSs, and more
• Domain awareness systems, such as closed-circuit television 
(CCTV), radar, automatic identification system (AIS), and other secu -
rity monitoring programs 
• Operational technology (OT) systems, such as industrial control 
systems, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)-enabled 
systems, cranes, conveyor systems, utility infrastructures, and 
others
124. Smart port communities have become progressively reliant on 
these systems and the IoT devices and platforms that enable busi-
ness intelligence. This business intelligence encompasses the data 
collected and aggregated to enable operational process improve-
ments, workflow efficiencies, and real-time condition monitoring (asset 
location, temperature, energy usage, among others) for the purpose 
of delivering situational awareness to inform decision making. 
125.  However, as more ports and maritime organizations connect 
these intelligent systems to existing networks, and further seek to 
adopt and employ IoT technologies—recognizing the corresponding 
operational efficiencies—new vulnerabilities will emerge that threat 
actors can exploit. In particular, where cyber-enabled systems inter -
sect with electronic, electromechanical, and SCADA-enabled systems, 
then access control, identity management, inventory control and 
security systems, cybersecurity, and traditional ISPS-related security 
vulnerabilities converge.
ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION885.2 Integrated Security Considerations 
for Port Communities 
126.  Port communities are essential contributors to a country’s 
economy. Securing port communities in today’s technologically 
evolving, hyperconnected environment is critical to the host country’s 
economy, the host country’s security, and the security of the individ -
ual port community stakeholders as well as their global network of 
trading partners. As required by the IMO’s ISPS Code, port facilities 
must monitor and provide for their own security as well as the safety 
and security of visiting vessels berthed at their facilities. Antwerp’s 
lessons are clear: Port facilities need to take an integrated approach 
to implementing and sustaining digitally enabled security in today’s 
threat environment.
127.  Every port facility needs to develop its own specific engage -
ment strategy around a foundational set of approach consider-
ations. As most port facilities must comply with IMO requirements, 
investments in integrated security should align with compliance 
needs, but also be designed to accommodate the technological evo -
lution underway in most ports. Additionally, long-term success and 
sustainability will depend on the utilization of an effective collabora -
tion mechanism (or the establishment of one) prior to or concurrent 
with initiating an integrated digital security project. Ultimately, tailor -
ing such approach considerations should occur through the develop -
ment of a core set of guiding principles set forth in section 5.6, The 
Proposed Approach for Implementation, at the end of this chapter.
128.  While effective security management is not a compliance-fo -
cused mission, it should still consider ISPS Code requirements.  As 
discussed at length in Section 1.3.4 of the ISPS Code, port facilities 
are required to perform port facility security assessments (PFSAs), 
which inform the subsequent production of a port facility security 
plan (PFSP). Port facilities subject to ISPS Code requirements must 
update their existing PFSPs if they deploy new integrated cyberphysi -
cal capabilities that result in material changes to the PFSP. ISPS Code 
elements that affect integrated cyberphysical security and operations 
include:
• Gathering and assessing of information with respect to security 
threats;
CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN89• Preventing unauthorized access to vessels, facilities, and their 
restricted areas;
• Monitoring of port facilities, including anchoring and berthing 
areas;
• Ensuring that security communication is readily available;
• Following procedures for reporting security incidents;
• Maintaining critical operations of port facility and ship–port inter -
faces; and
• Designing measures to ensure the effective security of cargo (con -
tainer, bulk, and break-bulk) and cargo handling equipment and 
storage facilities at the port facility.
129.  As an international framework, the ISPS Code offers guidance 
for organizations required to comply with the standards; however, 
the code does not offer specific, prescriptive guidance on how to 
achieve compliance.  Further, the ISPS Code is now 17 years old, and 
many ports have evolved since the ISPS Code’s creation in 2003. Thus, 
a key challenge is to implement efficient, effective, and appropriate 
integrated security solutions that support the organization’s efforts 
beyond that which regulations require. In this context, integrated 
security for port community members includes the physical, electron -
ic, and cyberdefense measures of digitally enabled systems that are 
integrated with a sustainable blend of people, processes, tools, and 
funding to counter converging threats.
130.  Although at the moment the ISPS Code includes relatively 
narrow cyberphysical security requirements for port facilities, the 
IMO has begun to take tentative steps toward a more comprehen -
sive approach. For instance, with the ongoing challenges imposed 
on the global economy by the COVID-19 pandemic, the IMO, with 
leading industry partners, recently acknowledged the extraordinary 
circumstances that now face the global port community—the national 
and regional lockdowns and staffing challenges that are resulting in 
logistics and supply disruptions impacting the world’s economy—by 
calling on the global port community to accelerate the digitalization 
of maritime trade and logistics capabilities. In Circular Letter No. 
4204/Add.20, Coronavirus (COVID-19): Accelerating Digitalization of 
Maritime Trade and Logistics—A Call to Action, 4 the IMO specifically NOTE

structure and its systems—the expansion of port community systems 
and their supporting infrastructures, and for members to review the 
“IMO’s Guidance on Maritime Cyber Risk Management 5 on its ability 
to address cyber risks in ports.”
 
131. The IMO Guidelines on Maritime Cyber Risk Management, 
which are currently in place for shipping companies, emphasize two 
key points. First, cyber risk management efforts should consider IT 
and OT environments in the context of safety and security.6   Second, 
the guidelines directly align with the five functions detailed in section 
5.3, Improving Cybersecurity for Port Community Stakeholders. Within 
the context of the IMO’s advocacy for a risk management approach, 
combined with their co-opting of the cybersecurity framework 
developed by the United States National institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST), it is possible that the IMO will eventually extend 
its cyber guidelines to facilities via an update to the ISPS Code. As a 
result, investment strategies for developing integrated digital security 
capabilities within port communities should consider the possibility the 
IMO will require port facilities to more fully address their cyber risks. 
PORT COMMUNITY COLLABORATION AND INFORMATION SHARING
132.  Although the Port of Antwerp attack was discovered back in 
2013, cyberphysical attacks against port communities and mem -
bers have continued to increase in frequency and sophistication.  
This presents significant challenges for defending against threat 
actors who are persistent, well resourced, and operationally nimble in 
employing a wide variety of cyberphysical tactics, techniques, and pro -
cedures to compromise systems, modify data, gain entry to facilities, 
and jeopardize maritime operations. Given the risks these activities 
present, it is crucial that port community members share informa -
tion at the port level, regional level, and sometimes national level to 
improve their security postures. 
133.  Sharing cyberphysical threat information can help port com-
munity members identify, assess, monitor, and respond to a range 
of threats. Mechanisms such as security alerts, suspicious activity 
reports, and breach of security notifications can facilitate the sharing 
of multiple types of information among security operations profes -
sionals. By exchanging cyberphysical information within a port com -
munity, and especially within a port community system environment, NOTE

the community to gain better insights into potential threats and make 
more informed decisions regarding the allocation of security capabili -
ties and resources. 
134.  Information sharing partnerships should be encouraged 
among port community members, including the captain of the 
port, local law enforcement, customs, various first responders, and 
logistics partners.  If no facility or mechanism exists for information 
sharing within a port community, the port community should estab -
lish a local body to organize and sustain information sharing activities 
covering cyberphysical security. Such a body can be formed along the 
lines of a local or regional area maritime security committee, with indi-
vidual subcommittees tasked for monitoring and sharing cyber and 
physical threats. 
ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION92Box 5.2Box 5.2. Function 1 (Identify) Case Study: Rotterdam
The nautical and maritime stakeholders in the Port of Rotterdam performed an analysis of the vital 
process, “safe and efficient handling of shipping,” to determine which systems and partners are vital to 
the continuation of the process. This analysis resulted in an overview of applications and IT infrastruc-
ture used by the nautical and maritime partners. It also identified the interdependencies between these 
systems. With this analysis in hand, the organizations were able to prioritize a set of measures aimed to 
ensure the availability and integrity of the process surrounding the safe and efficient handling of shipping.

Community Stakeholders
135.  Members of the port community ecosystem can reduce their 
own cyber risks by implementing essential cybersecurity building 
blocks such as a cybersecurity framework. The five-step cybersecu -
rity framework developed by NIST is one example for reducing cyber 
risks to critical infrastructure. 7 The framework has become widely 
accepted as a tool that can help manage and reduce risks related to 
cyberthreats and focuses on five separate critical functions needed to 
increase cyber resilience: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recov -
er. In this section, we outline the five functions and what they might 
mean for a port and a port community: 
• Identify.  The first function of the framework— identify—provides 
a necessary basis for any organization to start or further profes -
sionalize their cybersecurity measures. This function serves to 
understand the business context and critical functions in order 
to determine the areas where cybersecurity measures should be 
taken and prioritized. In this first step, the organization should 
define personnel roles and responsibilities for cyber risk manage -
ment and identify the systems, assets, data, and capabilities that, 
when disrupted, could pose a risk to the port operators. Box 5.2 
provides a case study example for the identify function.NOTE

National Institute of Standards and Technol-
ogy’s (NIST) cybersecurity framework online: 
https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/
new-framework.CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN93• Protect:  The second function of the framework— protect —includes 
taking measures such as putting identity and access management 
in place, to ensure access to data and systems is only granted to 
those who need it for executing their tasks. This aspect is also 
relevant to comply with national and international privacy leg -
islation, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR). The protect function also focuses on man -
aging protective services such as firewalls, end-point protection, 
and managing vulnerabilities and patching procedures. Further -
more, ongoing investment in staff training (IT, OT and support) 
should be made to keep pace with the fast-changing challenges 
of cybersecurity. Another aspect of the protect function is creating 
awareness. When professionals discuss cyber resilience, they often 
refer to people as the weakest link. And indeed, this could be true 
in breaches that involve phishing, social engineering, or another 
form of human contact. However, when “working cyber secure” 
becomes part of an organization’s safety and security culture, peo -
ple may in fact be your strongest link. When employees are taught 
to detect and report suspicious behavior, emails and changes in 
IT, they become a robust line of defense. It is therefore vital to 
invest in ongoing efforts to raise cybersecurity awareness. Also, in 
the protect phase a risk control processes and measures should 
be implemented, and contingency planning to protect against a 
cyber event should ensure continuity of port operations, including 
awareness on board level.
• Detect: The third function of the framework— detect —is one of 
increasing importance. Even though an organization has protec -
tive measures in place, it could still suffer from a breach or hack. 
To prevent or minimize the amount of data loss or damage to 
the organization’s cyber network, breaches must be detected in 
a timely manner. Benchmark research conducted in 2018 by IBM Box 5.3Box 5.3. Function 3 (Detect) Case Study: Los Angeles
The Port of Los Angeles Cyber Security Operations Center employs advanced technologies with 
layered detection capabilities, which block millions of unauthorized intrusion attempts at the perime -
ter of the network every month. Within the network, multiple intrusion detection layers continuously 
detect suspicious activities.
Source: Port of Los Angeles, CaliforniaThe five-step cyber-
security framework 
developed by NIST 
is one example for 
reducing cyber risks to 
critical infrastructureACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION94Security showed that on average a breach is detected after 197 
days.8 The same research revealed that the mean time needed 
to contain the breach was 69 days. Knowing the normal (base -
line) behavior of an organization’s IT and OT is crucial in detecting 
potential malicious activities. Box 5.3 provides a case study exam -
ple for the detect  function. 
• Respond and Recover: To be able to respond (phase 4) and recov-
er (phase 5) from a cybersecurity incident, an organization should 
have identified the need for backup and restore facilities. This can 
help to decrease the impact of an incident on port operations. The 
statistics on the lengthy mean time needed to contain a breach 
show it is critically important to work on incident response and 
recovery, the final two functions of the NIST framework. Incident 
response planning and training are crucial to decrease the mean 
time to contain a breach as well as prevent excessive damage, 
including reputational damage. The IT incident response team 
should be ready to act according to a predefined response and 
recovery strategy, which should include communications depart-
ments to ensure appropriate internal and external crisis communi-
cations to help protect the organization’s reputation. A computer 
emergency response team (CERT) is an example of a response 
capability. Vendors may offer this as a service or organizations 
could decide to set-up an in-house response team by extensively 
training and educating staff. Board-level awareness is also vital. In 
the end, the objective of cyber resilience is to reduce risks. The work 
of cybersecurity professionals contributes to decreasing the risk 
of comprises to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data, 
processes, and business. Without awareness at the top, an orga-
nization’s commitment to cybersecurity may result in a mismatch 
between its cybersecurity maturity and the board’s risk appetite. 
Box 5.4 provides a case study example for the respond function.Box 5.4Box 5.4. Function 4 (Respond) Case Study: Rotterdam
The Port of Rotterdam Authority has developed its own cyber crisis response strategy which includes 
a port crisis team. The aim of this team is to make strategic decisions on the continuation of safe and 
efficient handling of shipping. The crisis team is supported by three action centers. One center focuses 
on maritime issues, another on solving the IT issue at hand, and the final center aims to align communi -
cation (both inward and outward) between the parties involved.

Port Community Ecosystem
136.  The European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) has 
recently introduced four cyberattack scenarios at the port commu-
nity level:9
• Scenario A:  Acquiring critical data to steal high-value cargo or 
allow illegal trafficking through a targeted attack 
• Scenario B: Propagation of ransomware leading to a total shut -
down of port operations
• Scenario C:  Compromise of port community systems for manipu -
lation or theft of data 
• Scenario D:  Compromise of operational technology systems creat -
ing a major accident in port areas
137.  The port community ecosystem, made up of its many individ -
ual yet interdependent members, can reduce the ecosystem cyber 
risks and mitigate these scenarios by working together for port 
community cyberdefense. Working together involves port community 
members uniting against attacks and collaboratively implementing 
community cyberdefense strategy, governance, threat informa -
tion collection and distribution, data use, training and other factors 
important to the community. Working together does not mean that 
members share their cybersecurity internal operations or sensitive 
information with other community members. The benefits of port 
community cyberdefense include the following: 
• Greater collective knowledge. Community cyberdefense results 
in a greater collective knowledge base of the threats against the 
community. Similar to a traditional neighborhood watch scheme, 
each community member can now learn about threats they did not 
see from others in the community who did see, and then shared. 
• Improved resilience. Port community members depend on each 
other as goods are moved from one entity to the next within a 
supply chain. A disruption to one member will have ripple effects, 
as the recent Shen Attack Cyber Risk Scenario conducted by the 
University of Cambridge and Lloyd’s (Daffron 2019) aptly indicates. NOTE

• Early warning system.  Community cyberdefense provides its 
members with an early warning of threats against their communi -
ty. Members could be alerted of threats before the information is 
made available through other channels. 
• Collaboration forum:  In addition to the technical aspects, port 
community cyberdefense provides the forum for collaboration 
among members. Developing a body of knowledge, procedures, 
and policies for the whole community is paramount.
138.  To lead this effort, port authorities have been inherently 
endowed with a natural and neutral orchestration role.  This can and 
should be leveraged to facilitate dialogue throughout the whole port 
community ecosystem and promote a holistic approach that includes 
not only trade stakeholders, but also city and regional governmen -
tal agencies and ministries, including those responsible for national 
security and defense. Technologies can be a force multiplier for this 
orchestration to more effectively prevent an attack from propagating 
to multiple members in the ecosystem that potentially could cut off 
the flow of goods at a port and disrupt the entire community—and 
indeed national economies and international trade—by breaking the 
supply chain.
139.  The Port of Los Angeles provides a good example of a port 
community cyberdefense scheme.  Several port communities have 
already implemented various degrees of cybersecurity discussion 
forums and roundtables in their ecosystem; manual orchestration is 
a good start. The Port of Los Angeles has upgraded its Cyber Security 
Operations Center (CSOC), taking port community cyber resilience to 
the next level with advanced technologies to automate the orchestra -
tion of port community cyberdefense. As an integral part of the port’s 
Cyber Resilience Center, the second-generation CSOC will leverage 
the port’s existing cybersecurity operations, along with cyberthreat 
information from within the port community as well as cyberthreat 
intelligence from external sources for greater speed, accuracy, and 
quantity of relevant cyberthreat information to prevent incidents and 
serve a resource for restoring operations. Box 5.5 describes the Port 
of Los Angeles’s new Cyber Security Operations Center in more detail.The Port of Los Ange-

the first port in the world to implement a state-of-the-art Cyber Security Operations Center (CSOC). In 
2015, it became the first port in the world to attain the ISO 27001 certification, the international standard 
for cybersecurity. Continuing to advance its cybersecurity program, in 2019 the Port of Los Angeles suc-
cessfully completed its second-generation (G2) CSOC, shown in the photo. 
The G2 CSOC was developed on the original CSOC, but with upgraded technologies, new analytical 
tools, and the benefit of five years of experience and cyberoperations data to focus the G2 CSOC on the 
highest priority areas. Today, the G2 CSOC protects the port against more frequent, sophisticated, and 
damaging attacks, including 20 to 30 million unauthorized intrusion attempts per month. 
The next evolution of the port’s cybersecurity program will extend beyond the port authority and into 
the port community with its Cyber Resilience Center, a first-of-its-kind solution to reduce cyber risks in 
the port ecosystem. The G2 CSOC will be an important component of the port’s Cyber Resilience Center 
by sharing information with the Port of Los Angeles ecosystem for collaboration and engagement with 
stakeholders, which will result in greater collective knowledge and stronger community defense against 
cyberthreats.

140.  When addressing risks to a port community’s cybersecurity, 
the potential financial risks must also be considered.  According to 
the World Economic Forum, economic loss owing to cybercrime is 
predicted to reach US$3 trillion in 2020, representing 3.4 percent of 
global gross domestic product (GDP) (WEF 2020). In order to develop 
collaborative approaches and enhance cooperation between their 
public and private sector stakeholders, 10 port communities must not 
only initiate but, crucially, expand the cybersecurity dialogue within 
and between port communities; these conversations must be ground-
ed in financial terms. Doing so translates cyber risk management into 
the structural conceptions and financial management metrics of port 
business. Establishing the cyber-risk-to-money intersection across all 
areas of an organization will offer a means of measurement to inform 
investment decisions regarding resource identification, allocation and 
prioritization. Critically, this empowers decision makers with relevant 
commercial context and the key inputs necessary to make such judg -
ments in a consistent manner.
 
141.  To fund investment decisions, some port communities have 
taken key first steps to drive cybersecurity capability development in 
their environments by engaging with investors and experts.  Cyber-
security efforts are rapidly strengthening at key port trade hubs as 
a direct result of a new wave of investment accelerators, technical 
centers of excellence, and academic programs focused on innovative 
technologies, including startups in ports and maritime trade logistics. 
In 2019 alone, venture capital firms invested an historic US$7.86 bil -
lion in 646 cybersecurity startups, and with the emerging information 
security global market currently estimated at US$120.6 billion, oppor -
tunities for technological disruption will continue to expand and grow 
at an exponential pace. And so too will the cyberthreat landscape 
continue to evolve. Some of the companies around the world leading 
these efforts include PortXL in Rotterdam, Dock Innovation Hub in 
Israel, and Pier71 in Singapore. 11
142.  Ports must also take into account considerations surround-
ing compliance with IMO cybersecurity regulations.  While each 
nation has its own unique cybersecurity compliance requirements, 
this section focuses on security-related instruments directly affecting 
cybersecurity, which are provided by the IMO, the United Nations 
global shipping regulator. It is vital for ports, terminals, and port 
communities to have a clear understanding of how IMO regulates NOTES

aspects of port and port community cyber risk management. The 
two main IMO regulatory instruments in the context of port security 
are the International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code, part 
of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) 
1974, as amended in January 2020, 12 and the International Safety 
Management (ISM) Code, which has been extended by Guidelines on 
Maritime Cyber Risk Management. 13 The Code of Practice on Security 
in Ports, 14 developed jointly by the International Labour Organization 
(ILO) and the IMO, is also important in this respect.
143.  The IMO’s ISPS Code, as part of the SOLAS Convention, is a 
comprehensive mandatory security regime for international ship-
ping and port facilities.  The ISPS Code aims to provide a standard -
ized, consistent framework for evaluating all security risks, enabling 
governments to ensure that proportionate security measures are 
implemented. The ISPS Code focuses on threats posed to maritime 
security and more specifically, to certain categories of international 
shipping and the port facilities which serve them. The ISPS Code is 
divided into two parts: Part A is mandatory and covers detailed secu -
rity-related requirements for ships and port facilities, while Part B is 
nonmandatory and contains a series of recommendatory guidelines 
on how to meet these requirements. The focal point for port facilities 
is the ship–port interface, which encompasses the interactions that 
occur when a ship is directly and immediately affected by actions 
involving the movement of persons and goods to and from the ship 
and the provision of port services. In order to comply with ISPS reg -
ulations, competent authorities must undertake port facility security 
assessments (PFSAs) and develop port facility security plans (PFSPs), 
and port facilities must appoint port facility security officers (PFSOs). 
Port facilities will also need to monitor and control access, monitor 
the activities of people and cargo, conduct searches and screening 
(dependent upon the requirements outlined in their PFSA and PFSP), 
and ensure that security communications are readily available. The 
PFSP details the mandatory security measures at various security 
levels. As an instrument aimed at risk mitigation towards international 
shipping and the port facilities which serve them, the ISPS Code also 
has the effect of reducing unauthorized third-party access to port 
infrastructure.NOTES

PUBL_9221152863_EN/lang--en/index.htm.ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION100144.  The ISPS Code’s primary objective is to reduce threats towards 
ships and port facilities.  However, obvious indicators show the 
threat posed by cybersecurity is also addressed under this regulatory 
instrument, which has adopted an “all risks” approach to security. ISPS 
Code (Part A, 15.5.2) requires the PFSA to include the “identification 
of possible threats to the assets and infrastructure and the likeli -
hood of their occurrence, in order to establish and prioritize security 
measures,” which would include cybersecurity risks to port facilities, 
though the other elements of ISPS Code (Part A, 15.5)—including the 
identification and evaluation of important assets and infrastructure, 
identification, selection, and prioritization of countermeasures, and 
the identification of weaknesses, including human factors—would all 
involve cybersecurity risks, assets and vulnerabilities. Similarly, ISPS 
Code (Part A, 16.3.3), in regard to the PFSP, requires “procedures for 
responding to security threats or breaches of security, including pro -
visions for maintaining critical operations of the port facility or ship–
port interface,” which, again, would include cybersecurity. In addition, 
the ISPS Code (Part B, 15.3.5). requires that the PFSA identifies “radio 
and telecommunication systems, including computer systems and 
networks.” Cybersecurity is, therefore, a threat that must be consid -
ered alongside the other risks to maritime security under the PFSA 
and PFSP for port facilities. 
145.  It is also important to note that cyberthreats might originate 
from ships and port facilities themselves, with negative implications 
for operations.  An example is the malfunction or nonfunctioning of 
cargo-related IT systems either on the ship or shore side. As we have 
seen from incidents in the last few years, this can lead to a breakdown 
in port operations with broader implications for supply chains, and 
for national and international economies. Finally, a ship might itself 
pose a threat to the port facility, for example, it could be used as a 
base from which to launch an attack (ISPS Code, Part B, 1.4). Clearly, 
an important objective of the ISPS Code is to manage these broader 
cyber risks, leading to the conclusion that the role of the PFSO must 
encompass cybersecurity at the ship–port interface, rather than focus 
purely on more “traditional” physical threats. Indeed, this applies not 
just to cybersecurity at the ship–port interface, but more generally 
to cyber issues relevant for the wider well-being of maritime assets, 
infrastructure, and supply chain operations. CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN101146.  The International Safety Management (ISM) Code—Guidelines 
on Maritime Cyber Risk Management—is also helpful in this respect.  
The ISM Code, which was extended in 2017 with specific guidelines, 15 
recognizes that cybertechnologies have become essential to the 
operation and management of numerous systems critical to the safe -
ty and security of shipping and protection of the marine environment. 
The guidelines further acknowledge that the vulnerabilities created 
by accessing, interconnecting, or networking these systems can 
lead to cyber risks which should be addressed. In summing up the 
different areas for attention, the guidelines specifically mention cargo 
handling and management systems. The IMO’s decision to extend 
the ISM Code with Guidelines on Maritime Cyber Risk Management 
(MSC-FAL.1/Circ. 3) acknowledges the functionality of a broader cybe -
rhygiene to the security of shipping. As this basic approach closely 
mirrors the NIST Cyber Security Framework as outlined earlier in this 
section, and is also transferable to port facilities, a next step at the 
IMO level is welcomed to define how this should be operated in the 
context of the ISPS Code.
147. The ILO and IMO Code of Practice on Security in Ports extends 
the consideration of port security beyond the area of the port 
facility into the whole port and is much broader than the ship–port 
interface, which serves as the focus of the ISPS Code.  The ILO/IMO 
Code recommends the development of a port security assessment 
(PSA) and port security plan (PSP) for the whole port area (in a similar 
way to the PFSA and PFSP for the port facility under the ISPS Code), 
and the appointment of a port security officer (PSO). Among other 
measures, the code recommends the “identification and evaluation 
of critical assets and infrastructure that it is important to protect,” 
(7.1.1) and the “Identification of threats to assets and infrastructure in 
order to establish and prioritize security measures” (7.1.2). In addition 
the code also recommends that the PSP includes “details of security 
level 1 measures, both operational and physical, that will be in place,” 
(8.1.3) and “details of the additional security measures that will allow 
the port to progress without delay to security level 2 and, when nec -
essary, to security level 3” (8.1.4).NOTE

Risk%20Management%20(Secretariat).pdf.ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION1025.6 The Proposed Approach for Implementation
148.  Port communities need to introduce a standardized approach 
methodology.  After ensuring port facilities have addressed ISPS Code 
requirements and port communities have the infrastructure and 
mechanisms in place to share cyberphysical security information, port 
communities can begin planning investments around a standardized 
approach methodology. As port community members increasingly 
digitalize their operational environments, they must deploy integrat -
ed, digitally enabled cyberphysical security solutions that support ISPS 
Code compliance while also delivering appropriate, sustainable, and 
forward-looking security capabilities.
149.  Ensuring cyberphysical security capabilities are suitable for 
specific maritime and port operating environments requires port 
community stakeholders to engage with subject matter experts in 
assessing current conditions. Successful engagement necessitates 
a phased approach, which links financial investments to key mile -
stones—thus ensuring operational and financial alignment through -
out the process—in designing the most appropriate, sustainable 
blend of integrated cyberphysical security capabilities, and ensuring 
deployed capabilities align with defined goals and performance 
objectives. To assist with investment planning, a potential approach is 
outlined below:
CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN103PHASE 1—DEVELOP AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK 
• Task 1.1 —Perform preliminary background investigation.  Collect 
and review relevant documents and other information regarding 
the port community and its members.
• Task 1.2 —Consult with port community leaders.  Interview key 
stakeholders to gather preliminary information and identify opera -
tional requirements and performance objectives. Relevant organi -
zations may include port authority, customs, terminal operators, 
transportation entities (trucking, rail), pilots, law enforcement, and 
other first responders.
• Task 1.3— Develop the project scope. Discuss approach and review 
methodology and resource requirements, establish a communica-
tions plan, and examine current security issues and gather supple-
mental information. Develop a work plan and project schedule.
• Task 1.4— Perform a feasibility study. Develop a technical memo-
randum outlining the functions and operational requirements of 
the port community, its relevant integrated cyberphysical needs, 
and its security issues.
• Task 1.5— Review findings with defined stakeholders.
PHASE 2—DEVELOP A SECURITY PROFILE
• Task 2.1— Perform an assessment of the port community’s (or mem-
ber’s) existing cyberphysical security capabilities.  
• Task 2.2— Using inputs from Phase 1 and Task 2.1, develop a securi-
ty profile. The profile should define and characterize existing human 
capacity (including training), current processes and procedures, 
referenced standards, deployed technologies, integrated systems 
and platforms supporting security operations, information sharing 
mechanisms, guiding documentation (plans, strategies, and agree-
ments), planned projects and initiatives, and current and planned 
budgets. Cyber, physical, and electronic security infrastructures 
and technologies, controls, interfaces, data workflows, and other 
relationships should be detailed, including any security operations 
center that may be in place or in the process of being implemented.
• Task 2.3— Review findings with defined stakeholders.Ensuring cyberphys-
ical security capa-
bilities are suitable 
for specific maritime 
and port operating 
environments requires 
port community stake-
holders to engage 
with subject matter 
experts in assessing 
current conditions.ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION104PHASE 3—DRAFT AND INTEGRATED SECURITY 
STRATEGY AND DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS
• Task 3.1— Draft an integrated port community security strategy.  
The strategy should support a common defense critical to the 
ongoing viability of port communities threatened by sophisti-
cated threat actors. Coordinating such an effort requires the 
development of a coordinated security strategy that incorporates 
cyber, physical, electronic, and integrated data security elements, 
technology refresh requirements, and recommended policies and 
procedures under a unified governance framework. 
• Task 3.2— Develop recommendations for integrated cyberphysi-
cal capability specification options. Security capabilities comprise 
people (security staff, operational leaders), processes (alerts, 
notifications, information exchanges, and others), tools (security 
technologies such as CCTV systems, security information and event 
monitoring (SIEM) platforms, and environmental sensors such as 
aids to navigation), integration pathways (integrating real-time vid-
eo and radar feeds and logging and monitoring of network activi-
ties), and budgets. Individually, such capabilities support day-to-day 
security operations, but when such resources are appropriately 
scaled, deployed, and integrated, port community stakeholders will 
derive far greater benefits via real-time or near-real-time action-
able information.
• Task 3.3— Develop security operations center options. Rapid 
digitalization within port communities will require an integrated 
cyberphysical security strategy that considers a diverse group of 
stakeholders, operational needs, potential interoperability across 
a range of technology platforms and systems, and coordinat-
ed, secure information exchange. An integrated organizational 
structure will also require consideration to facilitate streamlined 
monitoring, analysis, communication, collaboration, and response 
processes structured to improve the port community’s security 
posture, rationalize the utilization of human resources, and sup-
port the operational processes underscoring port-based com-
merce. A high-performing digital port security operation center 
should have the following technological capabilities:As port community 
members increasingly 
digitalize their opera-
tional environments, 
they must deploy 
integrated, digitally 
enabled cyberphysical 
security solutions that 
support ISPS Code 
compliance while also 
delivering appro-
priate, sustainable, 
and forward-looking 
security capabilitiesCRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN105• A scalable, integrated security management system;
• A security monitoring system with automated landside, water-
side, and offshore (coastal regions, ports, anchorage areas, ship 
channels, and others);
• A centralized and virtual command and control capabilities;
• Integrated key technology platforms, such as CCTV, AIS, vessel 
traffic management information systems (VTMISs), radar, and 
drone surveillance platforms;
• Integrated data enrichment and processing capabilities (that 
is, utilization of advanced and/or predictive analytics and/or AI); 
and,
• Integrated security analysis and information sharing among 
stakeholders responsible for cyberphysical platforms.
• Task 3.4— Review findings with defined stakeholders.
150.  Consider risk hedging through implementation of cyber 
insurance policies.  Globally, insurers currently offer over US$1 billion 
in cyber insurance capacity and are increasingly designing new cyber 
policies with specialized coverage, increasingly robust cover, and 
higher limits. However, the lack of actuarial data remains a challenge. 
In response, insurers are more proactively engaging clients by seek -
ing greater data on the extent to which clients have implemented 
and sustained cybersecurity capabilities across their organizations. 
This includes insurers requiring clients perform baseline assessments 
as a condition for binding and requiring recurring organizational 
cyber risk assessments as a condition of renewal. Insurers are also 
including within the policies a range of post-binding training and 
pre- or post-breach services, such as legal advisory, public relations 
assistance, forensic services, and call center support. These integrat -
ed service packages offer better options, pricing elasticity, and more 
comprehensive cyber risk management assistance to ports.REFERENCES

Implementing DigitizationCRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN107
6.1 Introduction
151.  The COVID-19 crisis has exposed vulnerabilities in the trade 
supply chain logistics as worldwide disruptions in medical and food 
supplies impacted health, safety, and livelihoods of billions of peo -
ple. Smooth functioning of maritime trade and supply chain logis -
tics are integral to economic development as well as critical to food 
security and distribution of essential supplies, including life-saving 
vaccinations and medical equipment across the world. In a globalized 
world where maritime trade accounts for 90 percent of the world 
trade and global logistics market account for roughly 8 to 12 percent 
of global gross domestic product (GDP), the ports and supply chain 
logistics sector plays a highly sensitive and accountable role, necessi -
tating leadership from the highest authorities to secure and efficiently 
manage the infrastructure services. 
152.  The available comparable indices indicate the impact of 
inefficiency on international trade.  The World Bank Logistics Perfor -
mance Index (LPI) and Doing Business Index (DBI) on trading across 
borders and the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness 
Index (GCI) 4.0 on efficiency on seaport services and border clearance 
indicate the extent to which inefficiencies at a nation’s sea borders 
can impact international trade competitiveness. Technological innova -
tions and digitalization provide opportunities to foster a more holistic 
approach and integrate the port ecosystem, thereby facilitating 
trusted partner collaborations between government agencies and the 
private sector and realizing significant efficiencies in port transactions.
153.  However, the implementation of a successful digital program 
also requires high levels of political commitment. Strong policy 
reform toward change management, a clear communications plan 
and ideally a focal spokesman, a supporting legal framework, busi -
ness processes optimization, automation, and reengineering between 
government agencies and private stakeholders stand out as immedi -
ate essential steps for nations to enhance the resilience and efficiency 
of supply chain logistics. This section identifies the institutional steps 
to manage the change processes to improve the resilience of the 
maritime logistic chain.Smooth functioning 
of maritime trade 
and supply chain 
logistics are integral 
to economic devel-
opment as well as 
critical to food security 
and distribution of 
essential supplies, 
including life-saving 
vaccinations and 
medical equipment 
across the world.ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION1086.2  The Institutional Framework of a 
Digitalized Maritime Trade Platform
154.  While the technology forms the backbone of a digital plat -
form, the institutional framework and available human capital are 
crucial to ensuring its success.  A successful digital platform needs to 
serve the interests of all its stakeholders and needs to be trusted. It 
also needs to be secure and resilient to the disruptions at process lev-
el as well as in the execution of nationwide infrastructure services. In 
addition, introducing and sustaining the platform requires adequate 
human capital, which calls for a trusted, neutral, and capable entity 
mandated to develop and operationalize an integrated system, in an 
open, transparent, and consultative manner.
155.  A high-level political commitment serves as the starting point 
to drive the change management process to digitalize the maritime, 
ports, clearance, and transport processes.  Potential conflicts of inter -
est and issues in a multipublic and multiprivate stakeholder environ -
ment in the short to medium term must be addressed, creating the 
need to introduce an appropriate, government-level legal basis. Insti -
tutionalizing the governance process at the government level, either 
by a ministerial cabinet decision or presidential decree, will layout the 
oversight mechanisms and decision-making responsibilities for the 
process.
156.  The recommended approach is to establish a three-tiered 
framework to move the agenda forward. The recommendation 
suggests putting in place a governance framework designed to foster 
a holistic approach to developing efficiency and resilience of mari -
time trade and logistics, and structured at three levels—Level 1: an 
interministerial committee; Level 2: a steering committee; and Level 3: 
a business-level process committee. The roles and responsibilities of 
each are outlined in the following paragraphs.
157.  Framework Level 1: The Interministerial Committee. The range 
of multisectoral, multidisciplinary responsibilities encompassed in an 
initiative of this type requires the establishment of an appropriate 
cabinet-level board forum, chaired by the prime minister or presi -
dent’s office. The committee will focus on the strategic coordination 
and the legal, regulatory, and policy issues. Table 6.1 outlines the pro -
posed composition, scope of responsibility, and suggested frequency 
of meeting.A successful digital 
platform needs to 
serve the interests 
of all its stake-
holders and needs 
to be trusted.CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN109Table 6.1. The Interministerial Committee

committee, with each allowed an equal voice. In strategic leadership 
roles, the committee chair and vice chairs will work to empower col -
laboration while leading the project and demonstrating their neutral -
ity. The core public partners invited to the committee should include

160.  Rather than establish a further series of committees, one 
option would be to use an existing modality.  In December 2013, 
the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Trade Facilitation Agreement 
(TFA) was signed, and with it, WTO members committed themselves 
to create or maintain a national trade facilitation committee (NTFC). 
A recent report by the United Nation Conference on Trade and 
Development (UNCTAD 2020) underlined the need for countries to 
consider the NTFCs as permanent platforms that coordinate national 
trade efforts—not just to implement the WTO TFA, but also the trade 
facilitation reforms beyond it. However, challenges in the institutional 
setup have emerged in many countries, raising the need to further 
strengthen the NTFCs. The recent call to action by the International 
Association of Ports and Harbors (IAPH) and others on June 2, 2020, 
proposed the NTFCs could be an excellent instrument to help mem -
ber states drive the change process in relation to the digitization of 
the maritime and logistics space. Setting up NTFCs to focus on the 
digitization effort would require a change in the mandate and their 
scope of action, but doing so will offer significant potential synergies. CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN113161.  The Government of Peru provides another example in 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Government of Peru estab -
lished on May 10, 2020, under Legislative Decree No. 1492, provisions 
to promote and ensure the reactivation, continuity, and efficiency of 
logistical operations of foreign trade, linked to the entry and exit of 
goods and means of transportation of cargo to or from the country. 
This includes the provision of freight and goods transport services 
linked to the foreign trade logistics chain, in all its forms as well as 
activities related to same in accordance with the provisions of the 
Ministry of Transport and Communications. The decree also includes 
provisions to procure the digitization of documents and processes of 
public and private entities, to optimize the time of operations, prevent 
and reduce the risk of contagion of personnel who provide services 
throughout the chain logistics, provide better health conditions, and 
finally, to guarantee the transparency in the costs of the services 
of the foreign trade logistics chain, which has been affected to a 
greater extent as a result of the health emergency national caused by 
COVID-19. 
162.  The Government of Peru recently affirmed the State has a 
duty to: (a) establish provisions to reactivate development of the 
logistics chain of foreign trade; (b) guarantee its continuity; (c) adopt 
provisions to promote the digitization of processes between public 
and private stakeholders that are part of the logistics chain; and (d) 
reduce the asymmetry of information between operators and pro -
mote the defense of the rights of consumers and users that partic -
ipate in the logistics chain of foreign trade. Accordingly, on August 
3, 2020, the Government of Peru published Supreme Decree No. 
008-2020-MINCETUR, which regulates the Law of  Strengthening of 
the Single Window for Foreign Trade (Law No. 30860). The decree 
also improves maritime single window (MSW) regulation and estab -
lishes a port community system under the aegis of the Ministry of 
Foreign Trade, including an interministerial committee.ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION1146.3 Encouraging Innovation
163.  In the context of accelerating digitalization in maritime trade 
and logistics, governments should also consider providing support 
for the development of digital incubators, accelerators, and ear -
ly-stage funding programs. A new wave of incubators and accelera -
tors in emerging and developing countries needs to be fostered to 
enable technology startups, supported by academic research, skills 
development and retraining, and outreach to attract talents and a 
new generation of digital maritime trade and logistics people in both 
the public and private sectors. Examples of such incubators and 
accelerators include DeltaX Ventures (Cartagena), founded by Socie -
dad Portuaria Regional de Cartagena; Pier71 (Singapore), founded by 
the Maritime Port Authority of Singapore and National University of 
Singapore; The Dock innovation hub (Haifa); Port XL (Rotterdam); and 
ZeBOX (Marseille). Government-supported incubators and acceler -
ators should be designed to support the digital maritime trade and 
logistics entrepreneur on the path “from mind to market,” that is, 
from the idea-stage of a business or product line, to the building of 
a prototype, to launching a new product, and finally to growing the 
business at home and abroad. Incubators should provide technical 
training, targeted business mentoring, and opportunities to network 
with the maritime trade and logistics ecosystem, investors, research 
institutes, and established firms. Accelerators should focus on help -
ing already viable startups to enter a high-growth stage through 
intensive training and equity-based investment. In 2019, venture 
capital investment in maritime trade and logistics amounted to some 
US$8.74 billion in 532 companies.
164.  A new era of governance to support digital maritime trade 
and logistics of the future will be needed beyond what exists today.  
New clusters of excellence will be required and will emerge, with 
some already forming at key hubs in developed countries mixing 
traditional port and maritime disciplines in new ways: PortXL in Rotter -
dam, The Dock in Israel, Pier71 in Singapore, and Delta X Ventures in 
Cartagena, are all substantive examples of new waves.CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN115165.  Many developing countries seek to improve the policy 
frameworks, technical programs, skills development programs, and 
financing initiatives that support entrepreneurship in the digital 
economy. The ultimate aim of these initiatives is to improve compet -
itiveness, attract investment, create jobs, and grow markets. Young 
people, who are consistently the first to embrace new digital technol -
ogies, often seek employment in high-tech sectors and can be critical 
to developing a competitive, skilled workforce in an increasingly 
interconnected world. Furthermore, the digital economy contributes 
significantly to GDP in developed countries and is vital to spurring the 
overall innovation potential of a country in areas such as research and 
development (R&D), high-tech industry development, and technology 
patent activity. Time has come for emerging and developing countries 
to move forward.
ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION1166.4 How the World Bank Can Help
166.  The World Bank Group (WBG) provides a unique repository of 
knowledge, technical assistance, and financial support for develop -
ing countries around the world.  The WBG is not a bank in the com -
mercial sense, but rather acts as a partner to assist countries in their 
journeys to reduce poverty and facilitate development. In the mari -
time sector, and the transport sector more generally, the WBG offers 
support to developing countries through policy advice, research, and 
analysis—drawing on the best global knowledge—along with target -
ed technical assistance to build capacity and development human 
capital in client countries. This analysis often underpins the case for 
public and/or private investment for priority projects and programs.
167.  More specifically, in digitization of the maritime sector, the 
World Bank Group can mobilize financing for clients at different 
stages of their digital development path.  The WBG can mobilize 
grant financing, subject to a successful application, from a range of 
potential sources—including, among other things, the Digital Devel -
opment Partnership (DPP), the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory 
Facility (PPIAF), and the Global Infrastructure Facility (GIF)—to facilitate 
upstream investigations to support clients in making informed choic -
es about the how, the when, and the what of their evolution along 
the digital road. Subsequently, the WBG can facilitate, following a 
formal request and the necessary due diligence, financing in the form 
of concessional or semiconcessional finance, and possibly grants, to 
support agreed investments—either unilaterally or in partnership 
with private finance.

AppendixesACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION118Appendix A: Port of Los Angeles—Port 
Community System Port Optimizer
BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
168.  The Port of Los Angeles, as one of the world’s busiest seaports 
and leading gateway for international trade in North America, has 
ranked as the number one container port in the United States each 
year since 2000.  In 2018, the port moved more cargo than in any 
time in its 111-year history—9.5 million twenty-foot equivalent units 
(TEUs)—the most cargo moved annually by any port in the West -
ern Hemisphere. The port, also known as the Los Angeles Harbor 
Department, functions as a department within the City of Los Angeles 
and is governed by the Los Angeles Board of Harbor Commission -
ers, a panel appointed by the Mayor of Los Angeles. Although a city 
department, the port is not supported by city taxes. Operating as a 
landlord port with more than 300 leaseholders, the port instead gen -
erates its revenues from leasing and shipping service fees. The port’s 
jurisdiction is limited to the Harbor District, which includes property 
in San Pedro, Wilmington, and Terminal Island. All port operations are 
managed by the Board of Harbor Commissioners in accordance with 
the Public Trust Doctrine to promote maritime, commerce, navigation, 
fisheries, and public access to the waterfront. As the busiest con -
tainer port in North America, the port interacts daily with key supply 
chain stakeholders focused on promoting trade and to ensure trade 
volumes move through the port in a secure and efficient, and environ-
mentally friendly manner.
169.  Undoubtedly, the container shipping industry has been faced 
with difficult economic realities, further exacerbated since the onset 
of the 2008 recession.  While the transition to ultra-large container 
vessels has yielded economies of scale, it has also led to new opera -
tional challenges for supply chain partners. Many shipping lines have 
entered into large shipping alliances, whereby up to six companies 
can share space on a ship—similar to the way commercial airlines 
share passenger space under codeshare agreements—causing 
greater complexity in cargo sorting and handling. Another challenge 
has been that supply chain information exists from numerous, sep -
arate sources—with supply chain partners often needing to access 
more than one dozen different websites for the information they 
need to manage their operations. Digitization facilitates this process, CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN119as illustrated with the arrival of the 18,000 TEU container vessel, the 
CMA-CGM Benjamin Franklin on December 26, 2015. The port was 
honored to become the first North American port to receive an ultra-
large container vessel. The Port was able to work with CMA-CGM and 
APM Terminals to use advance data to optimize the conveyance of the 
cargo and turn the ship around 13 hours in ahead of schedule. This 
experience has encouraged the port to further explore this approach 
by digitizing information sharing through a common portal.
PORT OPTIMIZER™ PILOT PROJECT AT THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES
170. Some of the primary challenges associated with a complex port 
operation such as that at the Port of Los Angeles include:
• Visibility to incoming ocean freight to enable unload planning, 
truck scheduling, and chassis allocations
• Vessels anchoring due to unavailability of berths
• Delays in the discharge of cargo
• Truck congestion due to inefficient planning and queuing 
processes
• Shortage of truck chassis for the containers
• Inefficient rail planning and utilization
• Limited labor forecasting
171.  To assist in the resolution of the above challenges, the Port 
of Los Angeles set out to scope, manage, and execute a data and 
technology-based pilot project. The port wished to provide a single 
data, analytics, and technology solution that meet the multiple needs 
of its various constituents, facilitating better interoperability to result 
in increasing throughput and efficiencies within port operations. 
172.  On November 3, 2016, the City of Los Angeles Board of Harbor 
Commissioners approved an agreement to partner on the pilot proj -
ect with General Electric (GE) Transportation to develop a first-of-
its-kind, digital common user portal. GE Transportation was selected 
based on a public competitive request for proposal process per -
formed by the Harbor Department. Through the pilot project, the port 
anticipated improved performance for its supply chain users over an 
historic baseline along multiple dimensions:ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION120• Operational and energy efficiency: Use of the data would pro -
vide a line of sight to supply chain stakeholders so they can better 
allocate equipment and labor to handle cargo surges, thereby 
reducing cost and energy use.
• Transparency: Customs data would help provide supply chain 
users with visibility into the maritime supply chain, similar to what 
consumers expect from parcel service.
• Reliability: A line of sight into the supply chain would give users 
greater certainty and predictability, restoring the trust and reliabili -
ty damaged during the congestion experienced in 2014 and 2015.
PRODUCT PRINCIPLES
The principles guiding the portal include the following:
• Fits within the existing supply chain ecosystem, creating a “system 
of systems,” to enable interoperable supply chain visibility; the GE 
Transportation architecture and delivery mechanism is purposely 
flexible
• Explores, both openly and actively, potential technology partner -
ships across the maritime shipping and broader supply chain 
ecosystem
• Allows the client (in this example, the Port of Los Angeles) to retain 
ownership of their data and the ability to define data use, with GE 
Transportation acting as independent data steward and software 
provider
• Protects data privacy and does not share sensitive information 
housed within the portal, while maintaining open communication 
and transparency around data use 
• Provides a highly elastic capacity to support easy, scalable, and 
both rapid and expected port growth 
• Allows ample headroom to accommodate big data traffic
• Operates via a cloud-based, modular, and service-oriented system 
featuring a short release cadence, rapid production deployment, 
and experiment-oriented feedback and analyticsCRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN121173. In collaboration with the pilot project participants, the GE 
Transportation portal, known as Port Optimizer, was developed to 
receive and provide supply chain information through a common 
user interface with secure channeled access by user type. Project 
participants include the United States Customs and Border Protection, 
the port’s largest terminal operator (APM Terminal), the world’s largest 
(Maersk) and second largest (MSC) shipping lines, along with a variety 
of beneficial cargo owners, trucking companies, and chassis providers. 
174.  The Port Optimizer portal went live with a limited launch on 
April 17, 2017, with a full launch for all pilot project participants on 
May 17, 2017.  Since the portal went live, pilot participants have been 
able to view integrated supply chain data up to two weeks in advance 
of a ship’s arrival at port, whereas previously data were available 
typically only three or four days in advance. Participant feedback has 
been very positive, who have expressed the desire to expand the pilot 
to include a greater portion of the port’s supply chain.
175.  The agreement between the Port of Los Angeles and GE Trans-
portation (now known as Wabtec) was later expanded to further test 
the concept and benefits,  adding scalability for single-window access 
to timely maritime supply chain information, and building upon the 
initial portal to add six more terminals and 15 more shipping lines.
176.  The Board of Harbor Commissioners has taken several addi-
tional actions since the initial agreement, updating the scope of the 
Port Optimizer as illustrated in the following steps:
• November 3, 2016  Board approves pilot project
• April 17, 2017  Port Information Portal (Port Optimizer) soft launch
• May 17, 2017  Port Information Portal (Port Optimizer) live
• August 17, 2017  Board approves expansion
• August 17, 2017  Board approves revenue allocation agreement
• November 15, 2018* Board approves name change to Wabtec
• March 21, 2019  Board approves three-year extension, until November 2022
• October 8, 2019  Board approves reallocation of funds and deliverables
*In February 2019, GE completed its spin-off and merger of GE Transportation with Wabtec Corporation.ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION122177. To ensure the required data would flow into the Port Optimiz-
er, the port rolled out a financial incentive program that rewards 
container shipping lines for growing their container businesses 
through the port faster than the total United States containerized 
Trans-Pacific import trade growth percentage. The port objective to 
handle all, and certainly increased container volumes, in the most effi-
cient way possible, is possible with the Port Optimizer. As a condition 
to earn, this financial incentive shipping lines needed provide data into 
the Port Optimizer. The required data files are described in table A.1.

178.  In addition, the port tariff was amended requiring marine 
terminal operators to provide additional data elements into Port 
Optimizer (figure A.1).  The effect of those two actions accelerated 
participation of container shipping lines and marine terminal opera -
tors in Port Optimizer.
179.  All seven of the port’s container terminals provide data as 
well as nine of the top ten major global container shipping lines.  
The COVID-19 pandemic has required the port to reinvent itself very 
quickly, with the first order of business to protect essential workers, 
followed by speeding critical supplies through the supply chain. To 
that effect, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti named Gene Seroka as 
the chief logistics officer for the City of Los Angeles, which he holds 
concurrently with his job as executive director of the Port of Los. As 
chief logistics officer, Mr. Seroka’s goal is to ensure frontline medical 
workers get the required personal protective equipment (PPE), and 
to look for alternative PPE manufacturers to fill the need. This work is 
underpinned by digital technology referred to the “Medical Optimiz -
er,” a bolt-on feature of the Port Optimizer. The Medical Optimizer has 
allowed area hospitals the ability to track their inbound medical sup -
ply shipments through the Port of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles 
World Airports, expediting them to destinations as they arrive. More

CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN125Appendix B: Port of Shanghai—
Creating a Port Community System 
and a Smart Port
OVERVIEW OF SHANGHAI PORT
181.  Shanghai Port is a container port serving mostly import and 
export cargos.  Its annual container throughput grew from 1 million 
twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in 1994 to more than 43 million 
TEU in 2019, making Shanghai Port the world’s largest container port 
for ten consecutive years. As of August 2020, the average daily oper -
ating statistics of Shanghai Port are listed as follows:
• 130,000  TEU throughput
• 200,000  containers handled
• 1,500  transloading vehicle trips
• 47.5  mainline vessel calls (100 at peak)
• 115.6  feeder vessel calls (400 at peak) 
• 50,000  container trucks (peak hour 3,000 trucks)
182.  Shanghai Port’s public terminals are operated by Shanghai 
International Port Group (SIPG), which is a conglomerate estab-
lished in 2003 after the restructuring of the former Shanghai Port 
Authority. In 2005, SIPG was restructured to become a share-hold -
ing corporation, which was listed in the Shanghai Stock Exchange in 
2006, thus becoming the first port share-holding corporation listed in 
China. At present, SIPG is the largest listed port company in mainland 
China and one of the largest port companies in the world. It is pri -
marily engaged in port-related business in four areas: container, bulk 
cargo, port logistics, and port services. 
183.  Early on, Shanghai Port recognized the critical role an infor -
mation and communications technology (ICT) system could play in 
increasing its competitiveness. Import and export maritime shipping 
involves many stakeholders, lengthy processes, multiple intermediate 
steps, high-cost intermediate services, and a low degree of informa -
tion sharing. Additionally, the relationships and interactions between 
the stakeholders is complex. A well-developed ICT system will facilitate 
information sharing among the many stakeholders, reduce redundan-
cy in processes and documentation, remove operation bottlenecks, ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION126and improve efficiency. As such, Shanghai Port established Shanghai 
Harbor e-Logistics Software Co., Ltd. (Shanghai Harbor e-Logistics) 
in 2001 to develop port ICT systems with a mission to become a top 
provider of smart port solutions. After SIPG was established, Shanghai 
Harbor e-Logistics became a subsidiary of SIPG. 
DEVELOPMENT OF A PORT COMMUNITY SYSTEM
184.  Shanghai Port’s smart port development comprises four com-
ponents: terminal operation management, cross-terminal operation 
management, logistics service, and financing and other auxiliary 
services. The smart port development focuses on connecting ter -
minals, shipping companies, shipping agencies, freight forwarders, 
trucking companies, warehouses, storage yards, regulators, and law 
enforcement agencies to create an open and community-based infor -
mation platform, in essence a port community system (PCS). Shanghai 
Port PCS expands beyond the traditional business model that focuses 
on terminal operation to integrate the whole logistic value chain and 
create new business opportunities. It makes doing business with 
Shanghai Port easier for customers because it simplifies procedures, 
expedites processes, reduces cost, and improves efficiency. Figure B.1 
illustrates the key stakeholders of Shanghai Port PCS, while figure B.2 
illustrates components of Shanghai Port blockchain-based PCS. 
Figure B.1. Port of Shanghai: Port Community System Stakeholders
CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN127185.  A terminal operation system (TOS) processes essential daily 
workflow, including planning, dispatching, monitoring, and con -
trol, and plays a critical role in ensuring throughput and customer 
service quality of an individual terminal, which is on the critical path 
of the global logistics chain.  Shanghai Port, as a gateway of interna -
tional trade serving the vast Yangtze River Delta hinterland, manages 
multiple sea terminals and inland waterway transport (IWT) terminals, 
each specialized in container, bulk, and roll-on/roll-off businesses. To 
optimize operations of the many terminals within Shanghai Port, such 
as transloading from sea terminal to IWT terminal, Shanghai Harbor 
e-Logistics developed a port territory-wide cross-terminal operation 
management system. 
186.  In April 2012, Shanghai Port operationalized its first cross-ter -
minal operation management system.  Shanghai’s terminal operation 
management system, or TOPS, as shown in figure A2.2 (1- terminal 
Operating System -Container terminal, Bulk terminal, Ro-Ro Terminal  
[TOPS-C/B/R/Smart]), coordinates the dispatching, operating, and 
monitoring between Waigaoqiao terminal and Yangshan terminal. As 
of 2020, the cross-terminal operation management systems dispatch 
130,000 TEU and 250 ships daily.Figure B.2. Port of Shanghai Port Community System
ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION128187.  Learning from the business model of Uber—the car hailing 
application, In March 2013, Shanghai Port deployed a cross-termi -
nal container trucks transloading platform. The platform supports 
two-way transloading operations of container trucks across multiple 
container terminals, processing more than 2,000 TEU every 24 hours. 
The heavy loading-in and heavy loading-out ratio of internal contain -
er trucks with one-side container trailing has increased from zero 
percent to more than 80 percent, while empty loading ratio reduced 
from 50 percent to 26.47 percent. With the same level of service, 
diesel consumption within the entire port area reduced by 4,000 
tons, representing a 43.75 percent reduction of the port’s total diesel 
consumption.
COORDINATED MARITIME LOGISTICS, AND 
INCLUSIVE FINANCING AND FACILITATION
188.  In December 2014, Shanghai Harbor e-Logistics developed 
an information platform, Ganghang Zongheng, to standardize and 
integrate operation information of Shanghai Port and more than 20 
river ports along the Yangtze River, thus enabling one-stop, glob -
al, real-time tracking of ships, containers, cargos—including vessel 
name, voyage number, operation node, and location of containers 
and cargos. Figure B.3 illustrates the Ganghang Zongheng customer 
interface. As of July 2020, the platform has more than 180,000 regis -
tered customers, more than 1 million daily queries, and 300 million 
queries a year.
189.  In July 2015, the online central port business platform at 
Shanghai Port commenced operation, allowing forwarders to process 
import business and make electronic payments for maritime ship -
ping and port charges of all Shanghai Port container terminals. As of 
August 2019, import businesses are now almost all processed online, 
reducing required business processing personnel by 40 percent, 
labor costs by 60 percent, and carbon emissions by 90 percent.CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN129Figure B.3. Ganghang Zongheng User Interface
190.  In October 2016, Shanghai Port launched a mobile service 
platform, E-Truck Zongheng, allowing private container trucks to 
make appointments for port entry on the mobile platform. This plat -
form coordinates terminals, storage yards, truck fleets, machineries, 
and other services to improve efficiency of container transport. With 
more than 90,000 registered users covering almost all active contain -
er trucking operations in Shanghai, the platform has reduced truck 
fuel consumption and optimized resource utilization.
191.  In July 2018, Shanghai Port launched the Electronic Equipment 
Identity Register (EIR) platform. The EIR standardizes and digitizes 
the traditional equipment paper receipts previously  in use for forty 
years. In the same year, EIR paperless processing was operational -
ized for trucks entering or exiting terminals for container pick-up or 
drop-off. The EIR platform has saved an estimated RMB 400 million (in 
renminbi, equal to US$57 million) per year, after eliminating the pro -
duction cost of 15 million paper documents valued at RMB28 (US$4) ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION130
Figure B.4. Yangtze River Container IWT–Sea Intermodal Transport Service Platformeach. Looking at imports, the wait time from cargo arrival to cargo 
pickup has been reduced from 4.5 days to one day, since companies 
no longer need to process the release of container cargo at a physical 
window. Instead, the EIR allows the cargo releasing companies, truck 
fleet, and container truck drivers to exchange the required docu -
ments electronically around the clock. 
192.  In 2018, entrusted by the National Development and Reform 
Commission (NDRC, the national planning agency), Shanghai Harbor 
e-Logistics developed and promoted an integrated service platform 
for the Yangtze River container IWT-Sea intermodal transport ser -
vice.  The platform, as illustrated in figure B.4, serves individual ports 
along the Yangtze River—scattered in location and fragmented in 
service offerings—along with feeder line operators, shipping agen -
cies, freight forwarders, and other service providers to better share 
information and resources, and improve business. The platform will 
support the Yangtze River Economic Belt Shipping Alliance, jointly 
initiated by nine port groups, including SIPG, Nanjing Port Group and 
Jiujiang Port Group, and five shipping companies, including China 
Yangtze Shipping Group Company, Ltd., and Yangtze Port Logistics 
Company, Ltd., to further develop shipping potential of the Yangtze 
River Economic Belt.CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN131193.  In January 2019, Shanghai Port launched the Electronic Deliv -
ery Order Platform, based on blockchain technology  and integrated 
with EIR, Shanghai Port’s unified business processing center platform; 
the E-Truck Zongheng container truck fleet management platform; 
and the Ganghang Zongheng port and waterway information service 
core platform to further improve doing business with Shanghai Port. 
To date, the bill of lading issuance rate exceeds 99 percent. More 
than 7,000 bill of lading orders and 17,000 TEU container transfer 
have been completed. In November 2019, Shanghai Port completed 
the first paperless transaction of packing list, EIR, and delivery order.
COORDINATION WITH THE SHANGHAI 
INTERNATIONAL TRADE SINGLE WINDOW 
194.  The Shanghai International Trade Single Window aims to 
achieve “one declaration, global customs clearance” and become a 
key node of the global trade network.  The single window for Chi -
na (Shanghai) international trade has completed version 3.0, with 
data from April 2019 showing that 100 percent of goods declaration 
and export tax rebate services in Shanghai Port are now processed 
through the single window. The single window features 15 functional 
modules, including goods declaration and transport mode declara -
tion. Connected with 22 government agencies and serves 280,000 
companies, the single window has reduced the time needed for cargo 
declaration from one day to 0.5 hours, and ship declaration from two 
days to two hours.
PCS SUPPORT IN RESPONSE TO CHALLENGES
STEMMING FROM COVID-19
195.  During the COVID-19 outbreak, Shanghai Port PCS was able 
to provide contact-free and zero-delay services to customers. Taking 
the delivery of goods as an example, customer verification, agency 
operation, payment, transport arrangement, and other related work 
can now be completed online. It not only saves time and cost, but also 
ensures health and safety. As a full-service marine logistics provider, 
Shanghai Port continues to explore “port for city prosperity and city 
for port development,” with the vision of becoming a globally out -
standing terminal operator and port logistics service provider. Shang -
hai Port PCS development principles are as follows: ACCELERATING DIGITALIZATION132• Change the development model from individual to synergy.  
The port logistics information network should be built to realize 
the information interconnection of the key stakeholders in the port 
supply chain. The traditional independent development model 
based on terminal operations should be changed to an integrated 
model based on the logistics chain, cross-region, and cross-port 
operation.
• Change the service model from passive to active.  The estab -
lishment of a unified external service window is necessary to 
realize the port business one-stop processing and comprehensive 
information query, and to change from the traditional passive “to 
give what customers ask” to more active service mode.
• Change the management model from fragmentation to sys -
tematization. The visualized tracking of the entire cargo transport 
process changes the relatively independent resource elements 
and management process to the digital and intelligent manage -
ment model.CRITICAL ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN THE RESILIENCE OF THE MARITIME SUPPLY CHAIN133PHOTO CREDITS
