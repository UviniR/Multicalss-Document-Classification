Backgr ound: Mobile phones may help young people (YP) access health information and support health service engagement.
However, in low-income settings there is limited knowledge on YP’s phone and internet access to inform the feasibility of
implementing digital health interv entions.
Objecti ve: We investig ated access to information and communication technologies among adolescents and young adults in
Zimbabwe.
Methods: A cross-sectional population-based survey was conducted from October to December 2018 among YP aged 13-24
years in 5 communities in urban and peri-urban Harare and Mashonaland East, Zimbabwe. Consenting YP completed a
self-completed tablet-based questionnaire on mobile phone ownership and use, and use of the internet. The primary outcome was
the proportion who reported owning a mobile phone. Secondary outcomes included phone and internet access and use behavior,
and ownership and use of other technological devices. Multi variable logistic regression was used to investig ate factors associated
with mobile phone ownership and with internet access, with adjustment for the one-stage cluster sampling design. A priori
exploratory variables were age, sex, marital status, and urban/peri-urban residence.
Results: A total of 634/719 (88.2%) eligible YP, mean age 18.0 years (SD 3.3) and 62.6% (397/634) females, participated. Of
the YP intervie wed, 62.6% (396/633; 95% CI 58.5-66.5) reported owning a phone and a further 4.3% (27/633) reported having
access to a shared phone. Phone ownership increased with age: 27.0% (43/159) of 13-15-year olds, 61.0% (72/118) of 16-17-year
olds, 71.5% (103/144) of 18-19-year olds, and 84.7% (171/202) of 20-24-year olds (odds ratio [OR] 1.4, 95% CI 1.3-1.5) per
year increase. Ownership was similar among females and males: 61.0% (236/387; 95% CI 55.6-66.1) versus 64.8% (153/236;
95% CI 57.8-71.2), age-adjusted OR 0.7 (95% CI 0.5-1.1); higher in those with secondary level education compared to primary
or no education: 67.1% (346/516; 95% CI 62.6-71.2) versus 26% (21/82; 95% CI 16.4-37.7), age-adjusted OR 2.3 (95% CI
1.1-4.8); and similar across other sociodemographic factors. YP reported that 85.3% (361/423) of phones, either owned or shared,
were smartphones. Among phone owners, the most commonly used phone app was WhatsApp (71.2%, 282/396), and 16.4%
(65/396) reported having ever used their phone to track their health. A total of 407/631 (64.5%; 95% CI 60.3-68.5) currently had
access to the internet (used in last 3 months on any device) with access increasing with age (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.2-1.3 per year
increase). In age-adjusted analysis, internet access was higher among males, the unmarried, those with a higher level of education,
phone owners, and those who had lived in the community for more than 1 year. The aspect of the internet that YP most dislik ed
was unwanted sexual (29.2%, 136/465) and violent (13.1%, 61/465) content.

RenderXConclusions: Mobile phone–based interv entions may be feasible in this population; however, such interv entions could increase
inequity , especially if they require access to the internet. Internet-based interv entions should consider potential risks for participants
and incorporate skill-b uilding sessions on safe internet and phone use.

Introduction
There is a growing interest in the use of mobile phones to help
young people (YP) access health information, and to support
their engagement with health services. Data on YP’s use of
information and communication technology (ICT), including
mobile phones, are limited, particularly in low-income countries
[1]. Such information is needed to inform the development of
feasible and equitable digital health interv entions. Data suggest
that gender and socioeconomic gaps in access still exist in many
countries [1], and there is a risk that the introduction of digital
health interv entions may increase inequity in access to health
information and services. The importance of enhancing the use
of enabling technology to promote sustainable development,
gender equality , and the empo werment of all women and girls
has been recognized in Sustainable Development Goals 17 and
5 [2].
The 2015 Zimbabwean Demographic and Health Survey found
that 87% of households owned a mobile phone [3]. However,
there is little quantitati ve data on YP’s access to ICT, for
example, mobile phones, their patterns of use of ICT, and
whether confidentiality would be a concern when
communicating via phone or internet on sensiti ve topics. In
particular , while it is widely belie ved that mobile phone use
among YP is high, the functionality of the phones that are being
used, preferences for platforms and apps, and the extent of
potential challenges to interv ention uptak e such as
confidentiality , cost, internet coverage or speed remain
unkno wn.
With one-f ifth of the Zimbabwean population aged between 15
and 24 years, YP’s health is central to the country’ s development
[4]. However, health service uptak e by YP lags behind need.
In this high HIV prevalence setting approximately half of all
HIV-positi ve 15-24-year olds are unaware of their status [5]
and use of preventive services such as contraception and
voluntary male circumcision fall below national targets [6].
The aim of this study was to collect data on YP’s use of
information and communication technology to inform the
feasibility of implementing technology-based adolescent-health
interv entions in Zimbabwe.Methods
Recruitment
A cross-sectional population-based survey was conducted from
October to December 2018 in 3 urban communities (A, B, and
C) in Harare province and 2 peri-urban communities (D and E)
in Mashonaland East province. These 5 communities
participated in formati ve work for the ongoing CHIEDZA sexual
and reproducti ve health services interv ention trial. The
communities had been purposi vely selected to represent the
urban and peri-urban communities that would be included in
the trial. The survey was conducted in these communities so
that the survey team could benef it from the existing research
infrastructure and stakeholder relationships. Eligible participants
were aged 13-24 years, resident in the study community at the
time of the survey, and either provided informed consent (16-24
years) or provided assent with guardian consent (age 13-15
years).
We estimated that the prevalence of mobile phone (Textbox 1)
ownership among 13-24-year olds would be 50%. Assuming
10% nonresponse and a design effect of 2 [3], a sample size of
686 YP would provide ±8% precision around this estimate.
Using stratif ied sampling we aimed to recruit 60.1% (412/686)
of participants from Harare, and 39.9% (274/686) of participants
from Mashonaland East. A simple random sample of 100 GPS
coordinates (primary sampling unit) was sampled per cluster
from all potential points in the study areas using ArcGIS
softw are version 10.5 (Esri). Points were randomly ordered and
then sequentially visited by a team of intervie wers. All
households with front doors within 20 m of the sampled GPS
point were visited. The household head was intervie wed to
obtain basic demographic information about the household and
to obtain consent to intervie w any eligible YP. If the household
head was not available, another household member aged 16+
years or a neighbor was asked to provide information on the
composition of the household. Households with YP were visited
a further two times in order to intervie w the household head.
All YP in the selected household were eligible for recruitment.

Basic phone: Mobile phone with limited features (no web browser or apps) that is used primarily for phone calls and sending SMS text messages.
Featur e phone: Mobile phone with more features than a basic phone and usually has a camera, supports some apps but not all third-party apps, and
features a web browser.
Smartphone: Mobile phone built on a mobile computing platform (eg, Apple OS, Android) and supports third-party apps.
Phone ownership: Has sole ownership of a mobile phone.
Phone sharing: Having joint ownership of or access to someone else’s mobile phone.
Primary phone: The phone that the respondent reports as the main phone that they use.
Technological devices: Desktop computer , laptop computer , tablet/iP ad, mobile phone, iPod or other MP3 player , TV, radio, digital camera, gaming
console, handheld gaming device.
Data Collection
Participants responded to a 30-minute audio computer -assisted
self-intervie wing (ACASI) tablet-based questionnaire
(Multimedia Appendix 1). ACASI was facilitated by trained
research assistants who oriented the intervie wees and were
present during the intervie w to troubleshoot or answer questions.
Questionnaire topics included use and ownership of
technological devices including mobile phone, and access to
and use of the internet. Questions were adapted from
pre-e xisting questionnaires [8-11]. The questionnaire was
developed in English and translated into Shona (the local
language). Modif ications were made to the questionnaire
following pretesting with the study team and following the pilot
survey which was conducted outside the selected study sites.
Data Management and Analysis
The primary outcome was the prevalence of mobile phone
ownership among 13-24-year olds. Secondary outcomes were
the characteristics of mobile phones and phone use behavior;
internet access and use behaviors; and ownership and use of
other technological devices such as tablets, desktops, and
laptops. Data were collected and recorded using Open Data Kit
survey softw are with built-in logical checks and skip patterns
on Android tablets. Data were analyzed using STATA version
15.1 (StataCorp). Using sampling weights and robust standard
errors to account for the clustered sampling design (one-stage
cluster sampling). Multi variable logistic regression was used
to calculate age-adjusted odds ratios for the association between
explanatory factors and mobile phone ownership, and with
internet use. Potential explanatory variables were age, sex,marital status, community of residence, highest level of school
attended, current occupational status, religion, travel for at least
1 month in past 12 months, length of time living in the
community , and orphan status, with age being considered an a
priori potential confounder . Wald tests adjusted for the clustered
sampling design were used at each step of the analysis.
Ethical Considerations
Ethical appro val was obtained from the Institutional Review
Board of the Biomedical Research and Training Institute
(AP149/2018), the Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe
(MRCZ/A/2362), and the London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine Research Ethics Committee (LSHTM REC,
No. 15919). Written informed consent was obtained from
parents or guardians of study participants aged below 16 years,
along with participant assent. Participants aged 16 years and
older consented independently .
Results
Study Population
In total, 1212 households were sampled from 140 GPS point
clusters in 5 suburbs (A 25, B 48, C 21, D 42, and E 4; Figure
1). A total of 719 YP in the target age range were identif ied
from 491 households (41.05% [491/1196] of successfully
intervie wed households); 634/719 (88.2%) YP were included
in the study with 633/634 providing information on mobile
phone ownership. Fewer GPS point clusters in community E
were visited and only 10 participants were intervie wed in that
community . Community E was included in the descripti ve
analysis but excluded from regression analysis.

Mobile Phone Ownership and Access
The prevalence of mobile phone ownership was 62.6% (396/633;
95% CI 58.5-66.5). Among the 237 who did not own a phone,
27 (11.4%) reported that they shared a phone (Table 2). In total,
423 out of the 633 YP intervie wed (66.8%; 95% CI 62.3, 71.1)
reported either owning or sharing a phone, with 18.0% (76/423)
currently using (owning or sharing) 2 or more phones
(Multimedia Appendix 2). The use of multiple phone numbers
was common, with 26.5% (112/423) currently using and 42.8%(181/423) having used more than 1 phone number in the past
year. The majority (85.3%, 361/423) of primary phones, either
owned or shared, were reported to be smartphones.
Female phone sharers reported sharing phones with their mother
(18/50, 36%), partner/bo yfriend (14/50, 28%), or siblings (12/50,
24%), whereas male phone sharers reported sharing phones
primarily with their siblings (11/20, 55%). Almost all (67/70,
96%) respondents who reported sharing phones did so at least
once a week (Multimedia Appendix 2).

The main reasons for not owning or sharing a phone were
have/had a phone but it is not working (27.6%, 58/210), cost
(21.9%, 46/210), and not being allowed (17.1%, 36/210).
However, 63.8% (134/210) of those who did not have access
to a phone reported planning to buy one in the near future
(Multimedia Appendix 3).
The median age at first mobile phone use was 13 years (IQR
12-15) and 15 years (IQR 13-16) for male and female
respondents, respecti vely (Multimedia Appendix 4). First phones
were primarily purchased by parents (237/367, 64.6%) or other
relati ves (83/367, 22.6%).Prevalence of phone ownership increased with age of the
respondent with 27.0% (43/159) of 13-15-year olds, 61.0%
(72/118) of 16-17-year olds, 71.5% (103/144) of 18-19-year

Phone Use Beha vior
In total 4 in 10 phone owners reported that they never turned
their phone off and 25.9% (103/397) reported that they could
not do without their phone for a day. Among school-going
phone-using respondents, just over half reported regularly
bringing their phone to school. YP reported that the best thing
about having a mobile phone was that it was convenient and
made life easier (Multimedia Appendix 5).
The majority (280/423, 66.2%) of phone users spent US $1-3
per week on phone credit with 9.9% (42/423) spending nothing.
Most phone users reported spending less on airtime in the past
week when compared to other personal expenditure but 23.9%
(101/423) reported having spent more on airtime. Phone credit
was paid for by a combination of the respondent, their familymembers, or their friends. Half of females and a quarter of males
reported that their boyfriend or girlfriend paid for phone credit
(Multimedia Appendix 6).
The most commonly used phone features were the clock, instant
messaging/chat, camera, and the calendar (Figure 2). The most
commonly used app was WhatsApp (70.9%, 300/423). Other
commonly used apps were Facebook, Facebook Messenger ,
internet browser, Instagram, Twitter , YouTube, dictionary ,
bible, and calculator (Figure 2, Multimedia Appendix 7). As
many as 67.1% (108/161) of male and 56.9% (149/262) of
female phone users reported playing games on their mobile
phone. Candy Crush and Temple Run were the most popular
games among females and FIFA, Temple Run, and Dream
League were the most popular games among males.
Figur e 2. Frequenc y of use of different phone features among phone users.
Among phone users, a quarter report at least sometimes
searching for health information and 20.3% (86/423) for
information on relationships (Multimedia Appendix 7). A
minority (16.3%, 69/423) report having ever used their phone
to track their health. Males were more likely than females to
report having used a phone to track their health (21.1% [34/161]
versus 13.4% [35/262], P=.03). When asked to list the apps that
they used to track their personal health, the majority mentionedweb browsers, YouTube, and social media platforms. Specif ic
apps mentioned related to fitness, blood pressure, sugar levels,
body temperature, HIV testing, skincare, period track ers, home
remedies app, and health tips (including daily health tips).
In total, 4 in 10 phone owners (44.2%, 175/396) reported that
the information stored on their phone was not private. A similar
proportion thought that the information they sent on their phone

Inter net Use
A total of 407/631 (64.5%) respondents (95% CI 60.3-68.5)
had access to the internet (used in the last 3 months), with 73.8%
(468/634) reporting ever using the internet. Ever internet users
reported accessing the internet frequently (at least once per
week) on a mobile phone (78.2%, 366/468) or on a computer
at work or school (18.6%, 87/468). Frequent access to the
internet on other computers was rare: commercial internet outlet
(5.6%, 26/468), at home (6.8%, 32/468), at someone else’s
house (4.3%, 20/468), or in a library/community facility (4.1%,
19/468; Multimedia Appendix 8).Internet access in the last 3 months increased with age (OR 1.2,
95% CI 1.2-1.3, per year increase; P<.001). In age-adjusted
analysis, internet access was lower among females (adjusted
OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.4-0.8; P=.001). Internet access was higher
among the never married compared to the married and
cohabitating (adjusted OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.5-5.5; P=.001), among
those who had secondary education compared to primary or no
education (adjusted OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.2; P=.03), and among
those who had lived in the community for more than 1 year
(P=.003; Table 5). Mobile phone owners had 9 times the odds
of having access to the internet compared to nonphone owners
(adjusted OR 8.7, 95% CI 5.6-13.5; P<.001). There was no
evidence of a difference in internet access according to religion,
community , travel in the past 12 months, or orphan status.

Discussion
Principal Findings
YP in Harare and Mashonaland East had high levels of phone
ownership and internet access and access increased with age.
A minority of YP used their phones to seek health information
or to support their health. Challenges that YP face when using
mobile phones and the internet include the cost of data, access
to phones/computers, speed of connection, exposure to unwanted
sexual and violent content, and concerns about security and
confidentiality . Older age groups could be targeted for
phone-based interv entions but ensuring equitable access to data
and charging facilities as well as training on safe internet use
are necessary .
Limitations
This study only collected data on YP living in urban and
peri-urban areas. An estimated 68% of Zimbabwe’ s population
live in rural areas [12] and there is a well-documented digital
divide with internet use much lower in rural compared to urban
areas [13-15]. Data on conte xtual factors, such as the availability
of electricity to charge devices, were not collected. A relati vely
high proportion of respondents reported access to a smartphone
but we did not collect data on the functionality of the phones.
We gathered limited information on respondents’ current use
of their phone to access health information and services.In-depth qualitati ve studies are needed to better understand their
current use, including barriers and facilitators, and to explore
willingness to use their phones to access information and
services. Alternati ve ways to understand YP’s digital lives,
which could be considered for future studies, are the use of
diaries or qualitati ve intervie ws which can probe for a detailed
understanding of use throughout the day [16,17].
Comparison With Prior Work
This study provides a unique insight into phone ownership and
use among YP in Zimbabwe as there is little published data
available for this population. Phone ownership among
20-24-year olds in this study (84.7%, 171/202) was higher than
national estimates from the most recent 2015 Zimbabwean DHS
(71.1% among females and 76.5% among males) [18], but phone
access was in line with levels seen in higher -income
Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries such as South Africa. A
2017 survey among adults aged over 18 in 6 African countries
(excluding Zimbabwe) found that 72%-93% of 18-29-year olds
reported owning a mobile phone, with the proportion owning
smartphones ranging from 17% in Tanzania to 63% in South
Africa [19]. A 2013/14 household survey among 9-18-year olds
in South Africa, Ghana, and Mala wi also found a large variation
in phone ownership ranging from 6.2% in females in Mala wi
to 50.9% among males in South Africa [20,21]. A 2012 survey
of secondary school students in South Africa found that 81.1%
owned or had access to a mobile phone [14].
Although phone ownership was comparable between genders,
males reported increased internet access/usage. Phone sharing
was relati vely common with differences in phone sharing
between males and females, that is, who they share with. The
lack of an association between gender and phone ownership
observ ed in this study is consistent with findings from South
Africa [20] and there is some evidence to suggest that as the
prevalence of phone ownership increases, the gender divide
decreases [22]. By contrast, we found higher access to the
internet among males, those not currently married, those with
greater than primary education, and longer -term residents.
Observ ed gender differences in internet access are in keeping
with other studies from SSA. A 2018 multicountry study among
adolescents in low- and middle-income countries found that
boys were more likely than girls to have smartphones (through
which they can access the internet) and used a wider variety of
phone features compared to girls [23]. A Ugandan study among

XSL•FO
RenderX18-24-year olds found high phone ownership among both sexes
but lower internet use among females compared to males [24].
The 2019 GSMA mobile gender report also found a bigger gap
for internet use than phone use, with women also using a smaller
range of services and spending less on their phones than men
[25]. Global goals have been set to provide internet access for
everyone and access to digital technology is considered an
important component to help adolescents achie ve their rights
[26-28]. The findings from this study contrib ute to our
understanding of which YP have and do not have access to
phones and the internet.
Implications for Inter ventions
Some kinds of phone-based interv entions are likely to be feasible
in this population and phones are increasingly being used in
Zimbabwe to facilitate health information and service delivery
[29-31]. A quarter of YP in this study reported sometimes using
their phones to access health information or services, suggesting
that phones may be an acceptable medium for health information
and services. A study of informal mHealth (mobile health) in
South Africa, Ghana, and Mala wi found that almost a fifth of
YP surveyed reported using their phones in the previous year
to obtain health advice or information [21]. Similarly , across 7
SSA countries an average of 17% of mobile phone owners
reported having used their phone in the past 12 months to get
information about health and medicine [32].
Current phone use behaviors and preferences can inform the
kind of interv ention that might be attracti ve to YP. Many of the
intervie wed YP use games and social media, and so health
interv entions that incorporate gaming and social aspects may
be attracti ve. A qualitati ve study in the United States identif ied
3 reasons that adolescents 13-18 years reported using ICT for
their health: to gather information, to share experiences and
view others’ experiences in order to gain social support or
inspiration, and to track health behaviors and goals [33]. In this
study participants reported using features that would correspond
with each of these 3 reasons (eg, used web browsers, social
media platforms, and health monitoring apps).
Older age groups could be targeted for phone-based
interv entions but some issues require consideration when
planning mobile phone interv entions with YP in this setting.
Access and Feasibility
Careful consideration needs to be given to equitable access to
interv entions, especially in terms of age and gender .
Internet-based interv entions that require access to a smartphone
or computer may be less feasible and increase inequality . Cost,
internet coverage, and speed may hinder interv ention uptak e
[23,25]. However, as with access to mobile phones, these factors
are likely to change over time. The functionality of phones and
the prevalence of fake smartphones should be explored during
formati ve work as not all smartphones may be capable ofrunning additional apps. Recording whether participants have
multiple phones or phone numbers may impro ve follow-up [34].
Phone sharing is relati vely common and YP’s access to phones
may be controlled by someone else which may limit their access
and raises the issue of confidentiality [22,35]. In this study
females were most likely to share phones with their mothers
and boyfriends/partners, and boys with their siblings. Females
also reported primarily sharing phones with their mothers in
other SSA countries [23]. Phone sharing behaviors coupled with
low confidence in the security of information on phones may
lead to poor uptak e of interv entions. This may be particularly
important if phones are to be used to deliver information or
interv entions on sensiti ve topics such as sexual health. While
the use of shared phones for sexual health interv entions could
be harmful for the participant, it could equally result in health y
discussions between the participant and phone owner .
Safety and Skills
Whether literac y and technical skills are a barrier to phone and
internet use should be assessed, and if so then additional training
and support provided [25]. Potential risks associated with
phone-based interv entions need to be considered when designing
interv entions and monitored closely during implementation.
One potential risk of internet use is exposure to unwanted
content [27]. Online risk can be categorized as exposure to
“content, ” “contact” (where the YP participates, even
unwillingly), or “conduct” (where the YP is the actor) [14]. In
this study YP report exposure to content but they did not
mention, nor did we specif ically probe about other risks.
Research suggests that YP are often resilient and have
mechanisms to cope with these risks but that those who are
vulnerable offline are often vulnerable online [14]. YP in this
study reported low levels of phone security and confidence in
the privacy of information. Safety and security concerns can be
barriers to mobile phone use [25]. Training for YP should
include security and confidentiality (eg, use of passw ords), and
the development of resilience to navigate risk in the online
environment [28].
Conclusions
Mobile phone–based health interv entions may be feasible for
urban and peri-urban Zimbabwean YP. However, interv entions
could increase inequity especially if they require access to the
internet. Provision of free internet access may remo ve this
inequity , but additional factors such as capability to rechar ge
one’s mobile phone and the technological capabilities of phones
should be taken into account. Involving YP from the target
communities in interv ention design teams is recommended to
develop more appropriate and feasible interv entions. Potential
risks to interv ention participants should be closely monitored
and mitig ated against by incorporating skill-b uilding sessions
on safe internet and phone use into recruitment activities.
