Abstr act
Backgr ound: There is a paucity of subnational data on patterns of mobile phone ownership and use in Tanzania to inform the
development of digital health interv entions.
Objecti ve: The aim of this study is to assess patterns of mobile phone ownership and use in pregnant women to inform the
feasibility and design of digital health interv entions for promoting timely uptak e of childhood vaccines in southern Tanzania.
Methods: Between August and November 2017, pregnant women in their third trimester were enrolled at health facilities and
from surrounding communities, and asked about their patterns of mobile phone ownership and use in an intervie wer administered
survey.
Results: Of 406 women, only 3 had never used a phone. Most women (>98%) could make and recei ve phone calls. Compared
to urban women, rural women reported higher mobile phone use rates but were less likely to be sole owners of phones, and less
likely to send or recei ve SMS, transact mone y, browse the internet, or use social media via mobile phones.
Conclusions: The findings suggest high feasibility for digital health interv entions delivered via mobile phones to pregnant
women in southern Tanzania. The feasibility of smartphone-based interv entions or strate gies relying on the use of social media
or the internet is limited.

Introduction
In recent years, many efforts have leveraged increasing
mobile-cellular subscription rates in low- and middle-incomecountries (LMIC) as a mechanism to promote childhood
vaccinations [1,2]. Examples of “digital health” strate gies for
promoting childhood vaccinations in LMICs include text
message–based delivery of educational content, appointment

RenderXreminders, conditional financial transfers, and tools to support
health care providers in vaccination delivery [1,2]. The
feasibility , successful implementation, and scale-up of these
digital health strate gies depends on the availability of
mobile-cellular infrastructure and patterns of mobile phone
ownership and use in target populations. Mobile-cellular
infrastructure and patterns of mobile use also provide insights
about the feasibility and potential success of next-generation
interv entions and technologies (eg, smartphone apps, wearables).
The government of Tanzania has developed a detailed
investment road map for the use of digital health interv entions
to strengthen the performance of the national health system [3].
Despite ranking 123rd among 143 countries in its Netw ork
Readiness Index, a measure summarizing the extent that
countries benef it from the opportunities provided by information
and communication technologies, Tanzania currently has the
third highest mobile cellular subscription rate in East Africa at
77 per 100 people [4,5]. In addition, several large text messaging
programs have been successfully implemented to deliver health
information to target populations via mobile phones. Examples
of such text messaging programs include the Wazazi Nipendeni
multimedia campaign and the mobile for reproductive health
educational messages for reproducti ve health [6,7] Yet, there
is little subnational data on mobile phone ownership and use
that are publicly available to inform the design and feasibility
of digital health interv entions.
In support of diverse research and interv ention studies in urban
and rural areas in Tanzania, we sought to develop a mobile
phone-assisted reminder and incentive system (mPARIS), a
digital health system capable of, among other things, sending
reminders and conditional financial transfers to mothers of
newborn children as a means of promoting timely uptak e of
childhood vaccines [8,9]. To inform the feasibility and design
of digital health interv entions using mPARIS , we used a
structured survey to assess pregnant women’ s mobile phone
ownership and use in the Mtw ara region in southern Tanzania.
The findings of the survey are reported below.
Methods
Mobile phone ownership and use were evaluated to inform
research on the feasibility and potential efficacy of SMS
reminders and conditional financial incenti ves for impro ving
the timeliness of childhood vaccinations in southern Tanzania.
The study protocol for the parent study , including objecti ves,
conte xt, and methods, was previously published [8]. The
protocol was registered in ClinicalT rials.go v (Protocol
NCT03252288) and appro ved by the Institutional Review
Boards at Duke University (Protocol 2017-0591) and theUniversity of South Carolina (facilitated review, Pro00051213)
in the United States, and the National Institute for Medical
Research (NIMR) in Tanzania (NIMR/HQ/R.8a/V ol. IX/2194).
Methods pertinent to the analysis of mobile phone ownership
and use are presented below.
The study was implemented in one rural and one urban district
in the Mtw ara region in southern Tanzania. In 2015, Mtw ara
ranked 13th in the Human Development Index among
Tanzania’ s 21 regions. Between August and November 2017,
pregnant women were recruited from 4 urban and 8 rural health
facilities and their surrounding communities. Eligibility was
limited to health facilities that regularly provide childhood
vaccinations.
To participate in the study , women had to meet the following
inclusion criteria: be 16 years or older , be in the third trimester
of pregnanc y, have access to a mobile phone, and provide
informed consent. Eligible women recei ving antenatal care at
participating facilities were approached by trained study
personnel and offered enrollment in the study . Participating
women and local community leaders were asked to identify
other pregnant women in their community , who, if eligible,
were also offered enrollment in the study . Informed consent
was obtained from all participating women. Upon enrollment,
a trained research assistant administered a structured survey
comprised of closed-ended questions to collect data on
sociodemographic characteristics, reproducti ve and antenatal
care history , and mobile phone ownership and use. Data were
collected electronically using the Qualtrics (Provo, UT) survey
platform installed on tablet devices.
Data were imported into the Stata version 16 (StataCorp, Colle ge
Station, TX) statistical softw are for analysis. Descripti ve
summaries (means, standard deviations, and percentages) were
calculated for relevant survey responses and are presented
below. Differences between rural and urban women were
evaluated using the 2-tailed Student’ s ttest for continuous
variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables.
Results
A total of 406 pregnant women were enrolled in the study . Table
1summarizes their demographic characteristics, and Table 2
details their mobile phone ownership and use. Enrolled women
were 28 years of age, on average. A majority of the women
were married, had at least standard 7 schooling, and were either
emplo yed or self-emplo yed. Education and emplo yment
distrib utions differed between rural and urban women. A
majority of women had started their antenatal care in the second
trimester and most had previously given birth.

Only 3 women, all residing in rural areas, had never used a
mobile phone. However, rural women reported more frequent
mobile phone use than urban women. Most women either owned
a mobile phone or could access one through family members
including the father of the child to be born. Notably , fewer rural
women reported being sole owners of phones compared to urban
women. Similar percentages of urban and rural women reported
using phones for making phone calls. However, compared to
urban women, fewer rural women reported being able to
communicate via text messaging and transact mobile mone y.
Fewer than 10% of both urban and rural women reported using
social media or the internet on phones.
Most urban and rural women said that important messages
delivered to a mobile phone would reach them the same day.
Problems related to phone charging and netw ork connecti vity
were reported to be infrequent (less than once per week) by a
majority of the women. Most women reported spending
500-2000 Tanzanian shillings (TSH; US $1 corresponded to
approximately 2200 TSH at the time of the study) per week on
phone-related charges.
Discussion
Study findings suggest high mobile phone access among
pregnant women in the Mtw ara region. Our data suggests the
feasibility of text- or voice-based interv entions delivered via
mobile phones to pregnant women in the Mtw ara region of
southern Tanzania, but there was less readiness for
smartphone-based interv entions or strate gies relying on the use
of social media or the internet. High rates of mobile phone use
for financial transactions (sending or recei ving mone y) and the
widespread use of bundles, both of which require menu-based
interactions with phones, suggest that Unstructured
Supplementary Service Data (USSD) assessments or
interv entions may be feasible. Potential applications could
include short questionnaires for data collection or monitoring.
Due to observ ed variations in phone access and ownership, it
is likely that any mobile phone–based interv entions will be
delivered to shared phones for some participants. This findingmay be of relevance to studies involving sensiti ve health topics
(eg, HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases; intimate partner
violence).
According to our data, the population in the Mtw ara region are
relati vely smartphone-nai ve, compared to some other Tanzanian
cities like Dar-es-Salaam and Arusha, where 4G netw ork
infrastructure has been previously reported [10].
Smartphone-based interv entions may be possible in Mtw ara,
but may require larger financial investments for the provision
of smartphones to participants, as well as higher training needs
to facilitate their use. We did not formally assess whether mobile
netw orks in the Mtw ara region would be able to support broad
use of smartphones.
This study is subject to several limitations. First, only women
who had access to a mobile phone were enrolled for the survey.
Our study , therefore, excludes women from families that do not
have access to a mobile phone. Literature suggests that women
from socioeconomically disadv antaged families are more likely
to lack mobile phone access [10]. Such women may be more
vulnerable and could potentially benef it more from interv entions
promoting health information and health service use. Second,
the selected facilities were within 20 kilometers of Mtw ara, the
urban regional capital and commercial center . Generalizability
of the study findings is limited to the specif ic study area in late
2017, as mobile phone use and ownership characteristics may
vary in other regions and is likely to increase over time. Third,
the study provides only conte xtual information for the design
of interv entions; qualitati ve work concerning end user
perceptions on feasibility and acceptability should complement
the design and implementation of specif ic digital health
interv entions.
In conclusion, study findings suggest high feasibility of text-,
voice-, or USSD-based interv entions delivered via mobile
phones to pregnant women in the Mtw ara region of southern
Tanzania. The use of social media and internet among pregnant
women is limited. Future studies may use this study’ s findings
to track growth in mobile phone ownership and changes in use
patterns among pregnant women in the region.
