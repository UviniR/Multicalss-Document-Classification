 Preface  
 
This paper was prepared as a background paper  for the World Bank’s Digital Economy for Africa (DE4A) 
initiative , in which  digital skills is one of the five foundational pillars , and which was launched  in January 
2019.  Presenting a digital skills framework  was considered the first step in preparing the digital skills pillar 
of the: (a) DE4A Country Diagnostic Tool , to be used by the World Bank’s country teams to present  
strategies to foster and leverage digital skills for the emerging digital economy, and (b) DE4A Score card, 
which is being used by the World Bank to monitor progress towards achieving the DE4A targets for the 
African continent  to be achieved before 2030 . These targets are aligned with the strategic orientations of 
the World Bank Group as well as the global development agenda (i.e., SDG 4).  
 
Earlier working drafts of this paper have informed ongoing work of the World Bank on digital skills and 
have been revi sed as this work evolved. An early draft formed part of the technical background work for 
the 5th Forum of the Partnership for skills in Applied Sciences, Engineering and Technology (PASET), 
which is facilitated by the World Bank. The Forum (“Destination D igital Africa: Preparing our Youth for 
the Future) was held in May 2019 in Kigali and attended by 21 African countries and many partner 
countries.  Subsequent revisions of the draft (July 2019 and November 2019) were used as World Bank ’s 
inputs for the  African Union ’s Digital Transformation Strategy for Africa . The paper and the proposed 
digital skills framework s were also used to revise the  Digital Skills pillar of the DE4A Country Diagnostic 
Tool , to prepare the DE4A Scorecard  and for the Digital Skills Country Action Plan Technical Assistance 
provided to PASET countries.  The Digital Skills pillar of the DE4A Country Diagnostic Tool and 
Scorecard,  which incorporate the digital skills framework  outlined in the paper , were revie wed and 
endorsed by the Education Global Practice in early 2020, and s ubsequently, all the 5 pillars of  DE4A 
Country Diagnostic Tool and Scorecard  were formally reviewed and endorsed by the World Bank’s Africa 
region in  May 2020. The present version incorp orates revisions  made in concepts and descriptions of 
programs, measurements and indicators, in line with the above work , and further elaborat es the advanced 
and highly specialized  digital skills using the EU’s e-Competence Framework for ICT Professions.

 Summary  
 
This paper presents a framework for digital skills, based on a review of international frameworks . It 
discusses the demand  and supply  of digital skills as well as  a mapping with formal education programs  at 
different levels of the system  that could produce these skills . It also gives examples of programs outside of 
formal education programs that could be used for imparting skills training. Finally, it suggests indicators  
(Annex 1)  that could be used to be tter measure progress towards the objectives of the DE4A initiative. The 
paper does not cover the question of connecting schools and universities to broadband, the types of 
technologies that could be used in education or the issues that need to be addresse d in implementing the 
use of technology – these are covered in other background papers . 
 
The paper highlights the following issues : 
 
(i) Digital skills for citizens and non - ICT professions : One of the most comprehensive 
framework s of digital skills for citize ns is the E uropean Union  (EU) ’s DigComp 2.1 Digital 
Skills Competence Framework  and/or its adap tation by UNESCO UIS  in the  Digital Literacy 
Global Framework (DLGF) . The DigComp framework  has 5 competence  areas , while the 
DLGF  framework has seven competence areas to better address  developing country contexts. 
Both have four proficiency levels – basic, intermediate, advanced and highly specialized , which 
can be further broken down into 8 levels depending on the level of task com plexity . The 
framework is especially useful for defining basic and intermediate skills that need to be broadly 
acquired by the youth population.  Adapt ation of t his framework to the local contexts  of 
countries is required , in order to develop relevant educa tion courses, training programs, and 
assessment frameworks.  Countries will need assistance to do this.  
 
(ii) Digital skills for the ICT professions require a separate framework that describes the highly 
technical content and composition of skills applied in the  ICT workplace.  The EU’s e -
Competence Framework 3.0 provides a useful reference which includes 5 competence areas 
and 5 proficiency levels  associated with  40 competencies required and applied in the ICT 
professions.  
 
 
(iii) While t he demand for digital skills is difficult to assess, especially in the informal sector, the 
requirement for basic digital  skills is likely to become ubiquitous . This is also the case  for 
intermediate level skills in most  formal sector  jobs. New approaches to assessing labor market 
demand, including data from online job search platforms  and Artificial Intelligence (AI) based 
analysis , can help to identify the skills that are in demand  at levels above the basic level . 
 
(iv) While  the supply of digital skills is equally  challenging to assess, self-reported measures 
suggest a large proportion of th ose living  in some of the Africa n countries do not even possess 
the most basic digital skills, which reflects their lack of familiarity with using a broad set of 
digital devices and services.  
 
(v) For non -ICT professions and citizens more broadly, digital skills can be developed though 
formal learning in educational institutions, a s well as informal and nonformal learning 
programs : 
a. Basic digital skills  should be provided to all high school students . While t he content of 
many of these courses is readily available,  there is important work to be done to adapt these 
to local contexts and to use local content.  Further, implementation challenges of delivering 
at scale have to be addressed . In North Africa, where primary schools are better equipped, 
basic digital skills can be provided at this level as well.    Digital Skills: Frameworks and Programs  
 
6 
 b. Basic and , in some cases,  intermediate digital skills  should  also be provided out side of 
school  settings , especially as the majority of young people in regions such as Africa are 
out of school. The se skills  would ne ed to be provided together with foundational literacy 
and numeracy programs. While a  variety of  learning content s associated with basic and 
intermediate digital skills  are already available, public -private partnerships would need to 
be explored for efficie nt delivery to this population.  
c. Intermediate  digital  skills  should be provided to  students in  upper secondary  schools  and 
to all students in technical -vocational and undergraduate non-ICT programs , as these 
students will enter occupations that require increasing use of technology .  At the technical -
vocational and undergraduate level, students in non -ICT courses that are more technology 
intensive can also to be taught advanced digital literacy skills . 
d. In order to develop intermediate, advanced and specialized skills for the ICT professions, 
TVET and higher education institutions need to develop and reform courses that are 
benchmarked to international frameworks. At  the TVET level, these include hardware and 
software relate d courses for IT technicians, while at the university level, they include the 
core engineering programs  such as  electrical and computer engineering /science  programs. 
At present,  both TVET and university courses in these disciplines are too theoretical and 
outdated. Considerable and sustained efforts to reform these program s are  essential for 
African countries to assimilate and diffuse digital technologies . Bootcamps and rapid 
skilling/coding courses can also help to produce advanced digital skills, especially when 
there are spikes in demand for particular skills/programming languages. These can be 
delivered  through  universities in partnership with companies , or by the latter on their own.   
Highly specialized  digital skills  will be imparted through  postgraduate programs in applied 
mathematics, computer engineering courses  of high quality to train faculty and to introduce 
new courses. These may have to be done  at the regional level  due to the shortages of highly 
skilled instructors who could handle such technical courses.

 1. The Importance of Digital Skills in Driving Digital Transformation  
 
Digital skills constitute  one of the five foundational pillars of the Digital Economy for Africa initiative, 
launched by the World Bank, and are needed to mobilize digital innovations to transform economies, 
societies and governments in Africa.  The other foundational pillars are d igital infrastructure, digital 
platforms, digital financial services and digital entrepreneurship. African economies require both a digitally 
competent workforce  as well as digitally literate citizens  who could reap the benefits that the digital society 
brings.  
A digitally competent workforce can help strengthen the foundational pillars: the installation of the 
digital infrastructure  (for example, connectivity and data repositories ) that is most relevant for Africa, the 
growth of digital entrepreneurship  (for example, incubators and e -commerce, that shapes digital industries, 
and the development and use of digital platforms  and digital financial services  (for example, e -signatures 
and digital payments) . Moreover, a digitally competent workforce , comprising a  large majority with basic 
digital skills and a critical mass of skilled personnel and advanced specialists,  can help to extend the 
application of digital tools and processes in a wide variety of sectors, such as the informal service sector, 
agriculture, e nergy, transportation, health and education, to name a few.  
Digitally literate citizens can better reap the benefits of the digital economy by gaining access to more, 
better and safer information ranging from e -government services, commercial products and news, as 
well engage with the wider community.  In contrast , citizens who lack the capacity to digest complex and 
competing source of digital information and make appropriate judgements may fall into the traps of the 
digital economy, including financial fra ud and (especially for young people and children) physical and other 
forms of abuse and exploitation.  
The extent to which the spread of the digital economy is inclusive and broad -based will depend on 
the inclusiveness of the five foundations.  Equity in dig ital skills across the population is likely to play a 
particularly important role in sharing the prosperity promised by the digital economy.  A concerted effort is 
required to equip the young population with digital skills.  
Digital skills is one of the five  foundational pillars in the World Bank’s Digital Economy for Africa 
(DE4A) initiative , which includes Country Diagnostics on the state of the digital economy, a Scorecard to 
set targets and monitor progress, and World Bank investments and technical support  (See Box 1) .  As the 
term “digital skills” came to be used loosely across different pillars and strands of work, this paper starts 
with the framework that can help to define these skills and the programs/courses that could help to achieve  
them.  
Broadly speaking,  the digital skills for citizens and the general workforce and digital skills for the ICT 
professions involve different domains and competences and require different frameworks which specify the 
relevant competences and proficiency  levels.  These are summarized in Figure 1  and further detailed in the 
next section.

Box 1: The Digital Economy for Africa (DE4A) Initiative  
 
Prepared to support the implementation of the AU Digital transformation Strategy for Africa, the World 
Bank’s Digital Economy for Africa (DE4A) Initiative sets out a bold vision to ensure that every African 
individual, business, and government is digitally  enabled by 2030. The goal is to drive the digital 
transformation of Africa and ensure its full participation in the global digital economy.  
 
• The DE4A takes the approach of strengthening the enabling foundations that help advance a digital 
economy that promotes social inclusion and poverty reduction.  In case a country has good enabling 
foundations, it is on the path of developing a robust digital economy. The reverse may also be true. Based 
on the examination of the experiences of successful compan ies and public sector institutions that form 
digital economies, those foundations are taken to be: the availability of internet or broadband which 
brings people online, the ability to identify and authenticate people digitally, and the ability to pay or 
transact digitally. Digital economies further energize when there is sizeable population of tech -savvy 
workforce, and an ecosystem that supports firms to enter or scale up in ways that brings about digital 
transformation across sectors. Once those foundation s are in place, a wide array of use -cases can emerge, 
mostly driven by the private sector, in a digitalizing economy, bringing new products, services, and 
delivery channels.  
Measurable goals for 2021 and 2030 have been proposed with a DE4A Scorecard coveri ng High -Level 
Indicators and Targets as well as pillar specific High -Level Indicators ( Annex 1 ). 
 
The DE4A Initiative is also fully embedded in the IDA 19 Commitments. Key commitments include 
support to ensure: i) To help close the digital infrastructure g ap, IDA will support 25 IDA countries to 
double their broadband penetration (16 on the African continent), including eight in landlocked 
countries, by 2023; ii) 50 percent of entrepreneurship and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises 
(MSME) projects will inc orporate digital financial services and/or digital entrepreneurship elements – 
and ensure they address particular constraints facing women and people with disabilities ; iii) At least 
60 percent of IDA19 financing operations for digital skills development will support women’s access 
to higher productivity jobs, including online work; iv) All IDA19 financing operations for  
Digital Development will support women’s increased access to and usage of digital services; v) Support 
at least 12 IDA countries to adopt universally accessible  GovTech solutions; and vi) Support building 
client capacity in 50 percent of IDA FCS countries  to use field appropriate digital tools for collection 
and analysis of geo -tagged data; and apply this technology to enhance project implementation and 
coordination.  
 
The DE4A initiative has  prepared a Country Diagnostics Tool to guide the World Bank’s mul tisector 
task team in carrying out an assessment of the five pillars of the digital economy , as well as cross -cutting 
areas . This tool is current ly in the process of being deployed in a large number of African countries.

 2. Framework s for Digital Skills  
Africa still lacks a comprehensive framework for digital skills, although some countries have 
developed broad fra meworks.  Many OECD countries  and some Asian and Latin American nations have 
developed frameworks to guide measurement of digital skills in the population and support the development 
of education and training materials2. A thorough review of existing Digital Skills Frameworks was 
undertaken as part of the background work for this paper. The list of the frameworks is given in Appendix 
Table A.  
The most comprehensive and widely used framework  for general digital skills  is the European Union’s 
DigComp 2. 0 and its more recent update DigComp 2.13, which identifies five areas with 21 competences. 
The five areas are : (i) information and data literacy; (ii) communication and collaboration; (iii) digital 
content creation; (iv) saf ety; and (v) problem solving (Carretero et al.  2017). For each competence, there 
are eight proficiency levels  (in DigComp 2.1)  grouped into four broad headings —Foundational, 
Intermediate, Advanced and Highly Specialized. UNESCO’s Institute of Statistics (2 018) has built on this 
framework to adapt it to developing country contexts, as part of its goal to develop a methodology that can 
serve as the foundation for the Sustainable Development Goal for digital literacy .4 As part of this adaptation, 
UIS has proposed adding two more competences to the EU DigComp  2.0 framework, to include 
competences related to devices and software operations, and career -related competences . A detailed 
explanation on the competency areas and  proficiency levels is given in Table 1 .5  Figure 2 indicates that 
while the proportion of the workforce that has the basic level of proficiency in multiple competences should 
ideally be large, this proportion will decline for those with higher levels of proficiencies.  
Figure 2: Digital Skills Framework  for General Workforce and Population - 7 
Competencies and 4 Proficiency Levels  
 
 
2 Existing frameworks can be grouped into two broad categories: (a) Digital competence frameworks, whic h identify key 
components of digital competence, at different levels of proficiency and (b) User skills level frameworks , which indicate digital 
skills needed by different types of digital users.  
3 DigComp 2.1 contains no conceptual updates to DigComp 2.0 competence areas and competences but it includes updates to 
proficiency levels and examples of use.

level of proficiency in digital l iteracy skills”.

 The proficiency levels reflect “the cognitive challenge,  … the complexity of the tasks as well as … 
autonomy in completing the tasks” (Carretero et al. 2017).  At the lowest levels (1 -2), a person is able to 
carry out a simple task with help; at levels 5 -6, the person is able to apply knowledge, solve problems and 
helps others; while at levels 7 -8, the person is a professional who is contributing to technical -scientific  
knowledge in that domain.  Box 2 provides  examples of competencies and proficiency levels for different 
uses.  Digital Skills: Frameworks and Programs

 Box 2 Examples of Competencies and Proficiency Levels Required by Different Users  
Farmers : A mobile phone can help farmers to improve their earnings through their decisions regarding 
crops to grow, and markets to sell their produce. However, the degree to which this happens will depend 
partly on the technology (sophistication of the phone, conn ection to the Internet) and partly on the digital 
skills of the famer. The competence related to “ devices and software operations ” means that the farmers 
can input a SIM card into their phones, turn it on and charge it. Foundational “ information and data 
literacy ” skills would allow the farmer to receive text messages on their phone regarding weather 
forecasts, market prices of products, and effective farmer practices. With a high level of proficiency in 
the competence area of “communication and collaborati on,” a farmer could learn about connecting to an 
irrigation system and to program it by using online resources or tapping into an online community (UIS, 
2018).  
Students : At the foundational level of proficiency in “ creating digital content,” a student can create a 
digital presentation to showcase their work using, for example, a simple video tutorial from YouTube to 
animate the presentation.  In “ collaborating through digital technologies,” a student at an advanced level 
should be able to co -create data and  content for making a video, and be able to differentiate between 
appropriate and inappropriate digital resources (Carretero et al.  2017).  
Employee : A person who is seeking to improve their career opportunities would be able to use the tools 
of a massive open online course (MOOC) to enhance their learning experience.  This would require 
intermediate level proficiency in the competence area of problem solving (“ creatively using digital 
technology ”) (Carretero et al.  2017).  
 
Digital skills for the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) profession s require a 
separate framework that describes the  highly technical content and composition of skil ls applied in 
the ICT workplace. The EU’s e -Competence Framework 3.0 provides a useful reference that covers 4 1 
competencies required and applied in the ICT professions , using a common language for skill levels that 
can be understood across  Europe  (see Figure 3).6 A similar framework exi sts in the US called the Skills 
Framework for the Information Age (SFIA) . In East Asia, Japan’s ICT Dictionary is most commonly used 
as a reference framework for digital skills for the ICT professions.  
The e -Competence framework articulates competences req uired and deployed by ICT professionals 
(including both practitioners and managers). It was created for managers and human resource (HR) 
departments, for education institutions (universities, technical training institutions) and training bodies, 
policy mak ers and other organisations in public and private sectors. It can therefore be used (with necessary 
adaptations) to assess the quality of ICT and engineering programs at the university and TVET level, as 
well as those provided outside the formal education system.7

As digital technologies penetrate an increasing number of sectors and occupations, sections of the 
workforce that are in “non -ICT professions and occupations” will also require more specialized 
digital competences characteristic of ICT technicians and specialists.  Hence, there is not a strict one -
to-one mapping between the two frameworks and the two broad groups of professions.  Nevertheless, this 
distinction is useful especially in the African context where the majority of workers are i n non -ICT 
professions and occupations but will increasingly require basic or intermediate level digital skills as 
enumerated in the UNESCO DL GF/EU DigComp  2.1 framework. The digital skills proficiency levels in 
this framework provide an indication of the c omplexity of the tasks that can be undertaken  by non -ICT 
specialists . For example , foundation or basic level of proficiency  in digital skills represents abilities required 
to carry out simple tasks using simple digital technologies, such as the capacity to  use basic digital devices 
or applications. Basic digital skills are typically used in vocational or informal sector occupations and 
occupations involving routine tasks  – for instance, Uber drivers, grocery delivery personnel, etc . 
Intermediate level profi ciency  would typically be required in middle -level occupations such as the general 
workforce in formal small and medium enterprises (SMEs)  that are using a range of digital technologies  – 
small firms and shops engaging in e -commerce and using digital payme nts, journalists who can use digital 
tools for collecting, searching and analyzing information . Advanced level proficiency , which requires 
greater analytical skills as well as theoretical knowledge, is typically required in occupations with a high 
level of  ICT intensity . Figure 4 presents a rough mapping of broad categories of occupations according to 
two education -related dimensions – the theoretical and analytical dimension and job -specific competences 
8– and the use of the two frameworks presented in this section.  
Digital comp etences, apart from the most rudimentary ones —such as using a mobile phone for voice calls 
or simple messages —cannot be developed without foundational literacy and numeracy skills . Certain 
competences, such as communication and collaboration, as well as hi gher levels of proficiency in all areas 
of competence, also require socioemotional skills . These include characteristics such as perseverance, 
empathy, trust, self -control and self -esteem, among others.  However, even foundational skills are lacking 
in maj ority of the population, including among young people after several years of schooling, particularly

 in SSA.  Hence, developing even basic digital skills will require ensuring a minimum level of literacy and

 3. Demand for Digital Skills  
The spread of digital technologies may change the demand for skills in two opposing ways.  First, there 
could be an increase in demand for basic and intermediate digital skills which help workers deploy these 
technologies, as well as advanced digital and higher -order cognitive and socioemotional skills which allow 
workers to leverage digital wo rkplaces to engage in nonroutine tasks. Second, there could be a decrease in 
demand for routine skills or manual labor due to automation.  
There is little systematic data on how the demand for digital skills or skills more broadly is changing 
in Africa.  However, analysis presented in a background paper for the World Development Report 2016 
on Digital Dividends indicates that “employment in occupations intensive in ICT use at work in developing 
countries has increased by 10 percent between 2000 and 2012, alm ost two times the increase in developed 
countries” ( Monroy -Taborda et al, 2015) .   
The emergence of new industries and services in the digital economy, as well as the spread of digital 
technologies in many traditional manufacturing and service sectors, is likely to stimulate demand for 
digitally intensive occupations.  The ICT sector itself and emerging ICT intensive sectors  such as e -
commerce, Internet enabled offshoring and online work, bioengineering, and so on, will require a workforce 
with a range of di gital competences from intermediate to advanced and highly specialized levels. Moreover, 
demand will also emerge from the traditional sectors  which are increasingly using digital technologies, 
such as, agriculture, construction, transportation and logistic s, manufacturing, banking and finance, health 
and government sectors), in which the different categories of occupations, ranging from scientific to the 
professional, middle -level and vocational occupations, will require new digital skills.  Further, while the 
ICT and ICT -intensive sectors are not in themselves labor -intensive, they generate low -skilled and medium -
skilled jobs in services such as retail, food preparation, and cleaning .9 
Box 3: The demand for digital skills will be ubiquitous in the formal secto r 
The World Economic Forum (2018) global surve y of companies provides a glimpse of the forthcoming 
transformations across industries, including Africa.  The vast majority of companies in e ach of the 12 industries 
surveyed will adopt one or more of the 19  new technologies listed in th e survey.10   the highest level of adoption 
will be in user and entity big data analytics (85 percent of all companies), app and web -enabled markets (75 
percent ), internet of things (75 percent), machine learning and cloud computing (73 percent).  Skills in these areas 
will be demanded by over 65 percent of all industries —with ICT, professional services, global health, and financial 
services demanding these skill s the most.  
The other technologies that would have the biggest level of adoption include: digital trade (e -commerce), 
augmented reality, encryption, new materials, wearable electronics, 3D printing, blockchain, and robotics.  These 
technologies overall wil l be introduced in over 37 percent of all companies , with digital trade adopted in 59 percent.  
The WEF survey also defined the new jobs and new roles of workers. Top jobs that are expected to  be in high 
demand moving forward are : data analysts and data scientists, A rtificial Intelligence (AI)  and machine learning 
specialists, general and operations managers, big data specialists, digital transformation specialists, sales and digital 
marketing professionals, software applications developers  and analysts,  and innovation professionals.  Based on 
these surveys, the redundant roles are likely to be  data entry clerks, accounting, bookkeeping and payroll clerks, 
assembly and factory workers, client in formation workers. Analysis by LinkedIn in 2019, using its global database 
reveals a  trend of rising demand for jobs such as data scientists, AI and machine learning specialists , listing them 
on top of global demand including demand in Africa. Further, eve n where earlier jobs continue, workers and 
professionals would need to have hybrid skills —not only the skills of their core profession, but also digital skills . 
 
9 The World Development Report 2016 notes that “Kenya’s mobile money service M -Pesa uses more than 80,000 agents … 
Hormuud Telecom —the largest operator in Somalia —employs 5,000 staff but supports 25,000 agents.” ( p 106).  
10 The 19 technologies are: 3D printing, Aerial and underwater robots, App - and web -enabled markets, Augmented and virtual 
reality, Autonomous transport, Biotechnology, Cloud computing, Digital trade, Distributed ledger (blockchain), Encryption, 
Humanoid rob ots, Internet of things, Machine learning, New materials, Non -humanoid land robots, Quantum computing, Stationary 
robots, User and entity big data analytics, Wearable electronics.  Digital Skills: Frameworks and Programs

 For instance, an accountant would not only need the usual accounting knowledge, but also skills in spreadsheets, 
databases, etc.  A marketing director needs to also have skills in digital marketing,  social  media, and content 
marketing and using search engine optimization.  
a Note :  Only cities with 100,000 LinkedIn members were included  in this estimat ion, which uses the skills and 
employment listed on the LinkedIn profiles of people.  
 
However, the effective demand for digital skills from the informal sector, especially agriculture and 
services where the majority of people are employed in Africa, is l ikely to be constrained.  This is 
because of high levels of income volatility, precariousness of employment, and high opportunity costs that 
reduce participation in training or skills upgrading. This may constrain the spread of digital technologies in 
these sectors. Yet, it is pre cisely in these labor -intensive sectors where relatively simple technologies such 
as mobile phones can help to improve productivity in, for example, agriculture through better information 
on weather and prices, as well regular technical advice on operation s. Small service providers —food sellers, 
tailors, and so on —can expand markets through the use of social media. The informal manufacturing sector 
may also benefit from digital technologies such as 3D printing which allows for small scale and 
customizable t ools.  
Finally, ensuring that all citizens, especially young people, have basic digital skills is crucial for the 
extension of e -government services and for inclusion in the new economy.    
The extent to which disruptive technological change is labor saving  in Africa will depend on the 
number of routine tasks in jobs, that might make them susceptible to automation, relative wages and 
the lags in adoption of technology.  In general, with lower wages and slower rate of technological adoption, 
the risk of automa tion drastically reducing jobs is lower, which gives time for governments to put in place 
policies for upskilling the population (World Bank 2016).  However, each country needs to do this analysis 
to assess the demand for digital skills.  
Artificial intelli gence enabled approaches can provide real -time and predictive guidance on in -
demand skills and identify skills gaps , especially for the formal sector or for employers and workers 
engaged in the digital economy .   Traditional methods of assessing demand (em ployer surveys, industry 
consultations, focus groups) can take a long time, and results can become quickly outdated when the job 
market is rapidly changing. Further, the skills assessed are not granular enough to provide guidance to 
training providers to c hange their courses. An example of such a platform is JobKred, which has developed 
algorithms to predict the top job occupations, and top skills within these jobs which are demanded by the 
local area market.  Careers and skills recommendations engine is bu ilt by these methods to yield actionable, 
relevant and accurate career and employment data.  
 
However, in the informal sector, there are many knowledge and information failures that prevent 
the matching of demand and supply of skills . Many small firms, whe re the owners themselves have low 
levels of education, are often not aware of new technology and new skills needs.   As in the case of other 
skills, matching the supply with the demand for digital skills is best done in the context of programs that 
offer technical, financial and marketing services to the informal sector.

 4. Supply of Digital Skills  
While a large proportion of the population in Africa has some familiarity with using mobile phones, 
their capacity to handle a broader set of digital devices and services are likely to be very limited. 
Information about  the current status of basic digital skills in the population  is sparse .  The rapid spread of 
mobile phones and mobile Internet services, in particular, means that a large proportion of the population 
has some familiarity with devices (mainly phones), some digital services (government service s and 
payments), as well as social media. However, with the limited penetration of fixed broadband, computers 
and laptops, both in homes and educational institutions, it is highly unlikely that there is even basic 
familiarity with broader digital services.  Access to digital devices does not necessarily translate into 
acquiring digital skills, except the most foundational. Although many countries have introduced ICT as a 
subject in school education, in practice, most schools are not able to teach even basic skills because of the 
lack of electricity, devices, and access to digital materials or the Internet. Only a few have introduced 
computer -assisted instruction.  
Cross -national t ask-based measures of digital skills suggest that the share  of the population with 
basic digital skills is very low in a number of countries in Africa.  Figure 5 presents the proportion of 
the population with basic, standard ( which roughly  correspond s to intermediate level in Figure 2) and 
advanced digital skills  based on self -reported behavioral measures of digital skills . The figure suggests that 
there are considerably lower proportion of people in Africa  (Togo, Niger, Cote d’Ivoire, Djibouti and 
Tunisia)  with basic, standard and advanced digital skills compared t o countries in Europe, Asia and South 
America. It also points to a large within region differences whereby selected Northern African countries 
have a higher proportion of the population with basic, standards and advanced digital skills.  
Generally speaking,  information about the levels of digital skills is very limited. This is partly due to 
the lack of reliable metrics of digital skills as well as limited availability of any data on digital skills in 
Africa based on a representative sample. Many of the exis ting measures of digital skills are based on self -
reports or proxies based on possession of devices or tasks performed (see Annex 1). Many of the existing 
large -scale household or labor force surveys in Africa do not systematically collect information on d igital 
skills.  
  Digital Skills: Frameworks and Programs  
 
18 
  
Figure 5: Proportion of the population with basic, standard and advanced skill levels 
(2017)  
 
Note: Measuring the Information Society Report (2018). ITU’s figures are based on  Botswana (2014), Cabo Verde (2015), Côte 
d'Ivoire (2017), Djibouti (2017), Niger (2017), Egypt (2016), Morocco (2017), Sudan (2016), Togo (2017), Zimbabwe (2014) . 
ITU’s figures also assume that an individual has basic digital skills if he/she has  engaged in at least one of the following four 
computer -based activities during the last 3 months: (1) copying or moving a file or folder, (2) using copy and paste tools to duplicate 
or move information within a document, (3) sending e -mails with attached files, and (4) transferring files between a computer and 
other devices . These task behaviors broadly correspond to DigcComp2.1/UNESCO’s proficiency levels 2 in the Competency areas 
‘0: Devices and software operations’, and ‘2: Communication and collaboration’, and proficiency levels 1 and 2. The assumptio n 
is that individual’s proficiencies in DigComp2.1/UNESCO’s Competence areas 0 and 2 are correlated with those in other 6 
Competence areas. Another assumption is that the data from 10  of countries  represent data from the African continent.  ITU’s 
figures also assume that an individual has advanced digital skills if he/she has  engaged in the following computer -based activities 
during the last 3 months : writing a computer program using a specialized programming language . This task behavior broadly 
corresponds to DigcComp2.1/UNESCO’s proficiency level 5 in the Competency areas ‘0: Devices and software operations’, and 
‘3: Digital content creation. The assumption is that individual’s proficiencies in DigComp2.1/UNESCO’s Competence areas 0 and  
3 are correlated with t hose in other 5 Competence areas. Another assumption is that the data from 10 cou ntries are representative 
of the African continent.  
Digital Skills: Frameworks and Programs  
 
19 
 An alternative  way to assess the supply of digital skills is  to use information on the completion of education , 
assuming th at some form of ICT training11 is provided in education institutions  (see Figure 5).  Knowing 
the state of provision of school education, it is likely that students in high schools in the majority of African 
countries acquire only basic digital skills  (if ICT is included in the curriculum and actually delivered).  
Intermediate level skills may be provided at the upper secondary level.  A mor e careful assessment would 
require matching the ICT curriculum with the  competences and proficiency levels in the UNESCO/EU 
DigComp framework.  Digital skills for the ICT professions could be delivered at the upper secondary level  
and in TVET institutions  and technology programs in short -cycle tertiary institutions  (at the technician 
level), in university undergraduate programs in engineering, sciences, mathematics and related fields  and 
postgraduate programs in the same fields. Again, an assessment of the  curriculum of these courses against 
international frameworks such as the EU e -Competence framework would provide a better estimation of 
the skills of the students in these courses.  
Hence, using the proportion of students at different levels of education and in different types of ICT related 
courses could provide a rough estimate of the supply of digital skills through the formal education system.  
This mapping should be taken as indicative as  because much of the learning in SSA schools, including in 
techn ology related courses at the school level, tend to be theoretical and focused on rote learning which do 
not develop the competences listed in the above -mentioned frameworks.

“digital skills training ”

 5. Provision  of Digital Skills through Formal Education and Training Institutions  
 
5.1 Fostering  digital skills through  the formal education system  
 
The digital competencies listed in Table 1 can be acquired through formal education and training 
institutions for young people and on -the-job formal training and informal training (such as peer -to-
peer learning) for those in the workforce . Increasingly, online learning and blended learning are 
supplementing traditional training methods and vastly increasing the potential for enhan cing access.  
 
Universalizing basic digital skills  
Basic digital skills refer to the proficiency levels 1 and 2 in the framework outlined in  Table 1 .  A person 
who is proficient at this level would be able to do simple tasks that involve remembering content and 
instructions but also requires some guidance to execute.  
In sub -Saharan African, b asic digital skills programs can be offered in high schools (lower secondary 
schools) , covering grades 7 -9/10 approximately  and also at higher levels of education for those students 
who have not had access to digital skills training.   Apart from a few more advanced countries in Southern 
Africa, Kenya etc., it is un likely that primary schools have the minimum required infrastructure to provide 
digital skills training.   In Northern Africa, on the other, basic digital skills training can be provided in 
primary schools as well.  
An important decision is whether to provi de “stand alone” basic digital skills training to students or to 
integrate the use of digital technology across the curriculum.  Experience shows that the latter takes a long 
time, as teachers need to become confident in the use of technology and digital c ontent.  A promising way 
to start is to introduce basic digital skills training as a “subject” for high school students.  Essential steps in 
this process are definition of a curriculum,  selection of digital content  teaching methods, and assessment; 
the pro vision of devices that can be used by students in sequence but in such a manner as to allow equitable 
access; stable source of supply; connectivity to the internet  and regular, frequent training of all teachers 
(not just the ICT teacher) . 
An extremely impo rtant aspect is ensur ing that there is adequate and consistent technical support for 
teachers and students to troubleshoot issues with hardware, software, internet connection and use of content.  
Adaptation of existing basic digital skills curricula traini ng such as the International Computer Driving 
License (see below) is one quick way to introduce basic digital skills training.  
Intermediate digital skills for the general workforce and for ICT professions  
Intermediate digital skills refer to proficiency l evels 3 and 4 in the framework outlined in Table 1.  The 
student is able to independently perform simple tasks and well -defined and routine tasks, and 
straightforward problems, and where he/she is able to remember and to understand.  
Intermediate digital skills programs can be offered in lower and upper secondary schools  and should be 
made available to all undergraduate students in universities . Because intermediate digital skills require a 
greater understanding of content  in different  situations, they are best provided as part of teaching other 
courses. This means that use of digital technology needs to be integrated across several subjects. To begin 
with this could be done, in language and mathematics, as well as science subjects.  Digital Skills: Frameworks and Programs  
 
21 
 Integrating digital technology into teaching is far more complex than providing “stand alone” digital skills 
training at the basic level of proficiency.  It is ideal if the school has a plan for the use of technology, and a 
heavy emphasis on teacher developme nt and continuous support is required. Careful selection and curation 
of digital content appropriate to each subject is time consuming and requires technical expertise.  
For the ICT technicians, courses at the level of e -1 and e -2 of the EU e-competence framework ( Figure 3 ) 
are appropriate and these need to be provided in technical upper secondary schools and post -secondary 
TVET institutions.  
Advanced digital skills for non -ICT and ICT professions  
Advanced digital skills refer to proficiency levels 5 and 6 in the DigComp 2.1/DLGF  outlined in Table 1 . 
For those in engineering and  ICT professions, advanced digital skills refer to the proficiency level 4 in the 
e-Competence for ICT Professions framework ( Figure 3). A person who is proficient at this level would be 
able to deal with and provide guidance to others on different tasks a nd problems that involve applying and 
evaluating content in complex situations.   Advanced digital skills are required for African countries to 
diffuse and adopt new digital technologies across many sectors of the economy.  
Advanced digital skills programs for ICT courses require greater theoretical content and would typically be 
provided in relevant undergraduate courses  in universities and other tertiary level courses . Typically, these 
would cover : 
• Engineering course s, specifically electrical and computer e ngineering courses  (4-year courses) - 
these would constitute the core of the advanced digital skills programs  
• Mathematics, science and related undergraduate courses  (3-year courses) in universities and 
technology courses in tertiary institutions  
The discipline of electrical and computer engineering is fundamental to the technologies of the 4th industrial 
revolution when artificial intelligence systems will be ubiquitous. Hen ce, reforming the content, pedagogy 
and assessment of these courses should be a priority  (Box 4). 
  Digital Skills: Frameworks and Programs  
 
22 
  
Box 4: Advanced digital skills for the ICT professions require  reform of core engineering courses  
in universities  
Given the rapid advances in scientific knowledge, it has become impossible to fully train an engineer in the four 
years typically allotted for a baccalaureate degree at a university, or even in the cumulative total of eight to nine 
years typically consider ed adequate for an advanced (Ph.D.) degree. The implication is that no engineering 
curriculum should set out to provide a student with all the technical knowledge (s)he needs for a lifetime career.  
What is required is to structure a training program that focuses on imparting the fundamentals of the field, and on 
providing the students with the skill to learn how to learn on their own.   
  
The typical electrical and computer engineering curriculum at an African university differs significantly from that 
of a university in a developed country, for example in Korea or Singapore.  While most electrical and computer 
engineering curricula in the developed world are four -year programs, some African universities have five -year 
curricula for a baccalaureate degree. The key differences are:  
• A heavier course load in each year  
• The type of courses included in the curriculum, some of which are not directly relevant to core subject 
material for electrical and computer engineering  
• The content of the courses, which do not sufficiently emphasize the fundamentals, breadth and depth.  
• Lecturing as the dominant mode of instruction; no recitations and rare tutorials with small groups  
• Very large class sizes, ranging from 80 -150 students.  
• No capstone project  by students  
• Almost exclusive reliance on the final examination (no weightage to homework or continuous assessment)  
 
Engineering curricula and syllabi are not regularly revised in African universities and the lack of widespread 
accreditati on of engineering programs in sub -Saharan Africa by international bodies has serious implications for 
the quality of engineering programs in Africa.  
 
Modern engineering curricula are typically structured to fit within a four -level scheme that emphasizes c ertain skills 
and core knowledge.  At the base of the scheme are courses that impart foundational knowledge in the sciences 
(physics, chemistry, and biology), mathematics, and computing (computer literacy). The foundational background 
is followed by a set of courses considered to constitute the core subject matter of the particular engineering 
discipline.  Next, the student is exposed to the breadth of the subject after which (s)he can select one or two areas 
for an in -depth study. In addition to the course work, a typical four -year undergraduate program generally offers the 
student an opportunity to work on a capstone design project during the third or fourth year of their study.  Such 
projects usually have a minimum duration of at least one academic semeste r but could also extend to a full academic 
year.   Capstone projects are intended to help students assimilate and internalize core engineering concepts learned 
in the course of their study.  Most capstone projects at world -class universities are generally team projects intended 
to develop and impart interpersonal skills for working in teams; this is in addition to learning how to manage and 
cope with unknown factors as well as known (resource and time) constraints on projects that are designed to closely 
emulate real -world working conditions.  
 
Note:  Adapted from Towe (2019), consultant report.  
 
Highly Specialized  Digital Skills  for the ICT professions  
Although the UNESCO/EU DigComp framework outlines h ighly specialized digital skills  (proficiency 
levels 7 and 8 in Table 1 ), which could in theory be available to citizens and the general workforce, in 
practice this would be difficult to provide in the African context in most educational or other institutions.  
For the ICT professions, t hese skills , representing e -4 and e -5 levels of the EU e -Competence framework 
in Figure 3 ,  are typically provided at the postgraduate level (Masters and  doctorate level ) focusing on 
advanced computer science/ engineering, applied mathematics  and related fie lds, and cater to occupations 
such as data scientists and AI engineers . The availability of high-quality  postgraduate programs in these 
areas is very limited, especially in sub -Saharan Africa, outside of South Africa.  This has an impact on the Digital Skills: Frameworks and Programs  
 
23 
 quality of undergraduate training and also on the limited ability to develop new solutions and applications 
of digital technologies.  Development of high-quality  postgraduate programs requires a high concentration 
of resources and alignment with international benchmar ks for quality ; for smaller countries or those with 
weaker capacity, this is likely done best at the regional level, and for all countries, high quality regional 
programs can supplement national efforts.  
 
5.2 Fostering  digital skills outside the formal education system  
 
A few case examples are provided to show how different levels of digital skills are being provided 
outside the formal education system.  However, it must be noted that these levels may not exactly 
correspond to the frameworks mentioned in this paper and th ey are given for illustrative purposes.  
Basic Digital Skills  programs  – case examples  
 The International Computer Driver’s License (ICDL)  offers courses that are for beginners with no prior 
computer or internet experience (intermediate level courses are also offered – see below). The ICDL is a 
computer literacy program which is based entirely on the European Computer Driver’s Licence (ECDL)  
program, operated by the EDCL Foundation, and its syllabus, content and assessment methods have not 
been adapted to country contexts. Its syllabus is divided into modules and standardized tests are taken by 
the student after completing a module. It is adm inistered by accredited test centers  operated by course 
vendors, educational establishments, large organizations or companies, using guidelines provided by the 
ECDL Foundation.  ICDL appears to be the world's leading computer skills certification organizat ion. 
According to its website, more than 14 million people in over 150 countries have engaged with the ICDL 
program through a network of over 24,000 ICDL Accredited Test Centers (ATCs). ICDL is present in 
almost all African countries. For instance, in Sout h Africa, there are more than 50 ATCs, in Kenya more 
than 80, in Uganda 14 and in Rwanda 8.   
Box 5: ICDL in Kenya   
Kenya is an interesting example of full -scale adaptation (not adaptation!) of ICDL. Based on a government decision 
in 2009, ICDL has become the st andard offering for organizations across the public and private sector. Recently, 
ICDL Africa signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Kenya School of Government, to offer 
ICDL to public sector workers across the KSG campuses throughout Kenya. E ach year, over 10,000 new candidates 
register for the program, taking over 50,000 certification tests annually. ICDL Africa operates through an office in 
Nairobi, with a team of 4 full time staff, providing support to the large network of ATCs. Organizatio ns wishing to 
become an ATC, must first be accredited by the Technical Vocational Education and Training Authority (TVETA). 
The network of ATCs covers wide variety of sectors, including schools, technical training institutions, universities, 
Government ins titutions, NGOs and commercial training organizations. Every autumn, ICDL Africa hosts its 
annual ATC Forum, bringing together all ATCs, as well as key stakeholders in the ICT and education sector to 
discuss updates to the ICDL program and share best pract ice from around the  world.  
ICDL was adopted into national law in Kenya in 2009 when the Information and Communications  Act recognized 
the ICDL Certification as ‘the entry level computer certification designed to demonstrate competence in computer 
use'. (Th ailand has also officially recognized ICDL as an education standard. However, to our knowledge no 
European country has adopted ECDL into its legislation.)  
As a result, all training courses in Kenya meet the ICDL standard (earlier some computer literacy courses were of 
low quality) and employers can easily compare (formal) IT qualifications of applicants and employees. 
Unfortunately, no sources indicate how far the substance of the ICDL, which basically is PC -based, would benefit 
from including m ore on skills related to the use of mobile phones, which have been the important drivers of the 
digital economy in Kenya. It would be important to get an assessment of the appropriateness/need for adaptation 
of the ICDL from members of the business communi ty in Kenya.  Digital Skills: Frameworks and Programs  
 
24 
  Given the extremely low level of literacy especially in SSA countries, even the introductory courses of 
ICDL may need to be adapted for use in schools.  Box 5 provides information about the  implementation of 
ICDL in Kenya.  
The Digital Doorway (DD) project , launched in 2002,  provides  freely accessible ICT centers  in the form 
of “containers” . They  encourage digital upskilling and computer literacy in rural areas of South Africa  
through unassisted - and peer -assisted learning . Container DDs are placed in disadvantaged localities to 
improve the digital and informational literacy of disadvantaged children, youth and adults through 
experimentation and exploration by allowing them to “learn without formal training and minimal external 
input”12. Based on the open -source software Ubuntu Linux, the content of container DDs includes the 
OpenOffice suite, educational programs  and content including interactive scientific simulations , an 
introduction to computer terminology, scientific software, 10 000 books, Wikipedia, etc. This allows for 
“varying computing activities ranging from entertainment to independent research.” (Gush,  2011)  DDs 
come equipped with internet  and local  wireless  hotspots  for the content to be accessible to anyone with a 
browser.  A joint initiative of the government and private sector in South Africa, more than 240 systems 
have been deployed across all 9 pro vinces of South Africa as of 2013  with the latest installation being in 
2019 . Each DD has the potential of reaching hundreds of users.  70% of users are below the age of 21 years. 
They have also been deployed across other  African countries like Ethiopia, Lesotho and Uganda while also 
being deployed in Australia and Solomon Islands.  Each c ontainer house s a multimedia computer system  
with three or four user terminals . Container DDs are solar -powered and hence self-sustainabl e “robust and 
vandal -proof” units designed to thrive in areas without power or shelter.   
 
PraDigi  was launched in 2017 in rural India spearheaded by Pratham13. 10,000 Google tablets have been 
distributed to 50,000 children across 900 villages. Pratham, an influential non -profit, provides numeracy 
and literacy e -content and partners with Slam Out Loud, another non -profit which provides performance 
and visual arts -based educational content and training14. The goal is to provide a cross -disciplinar y 
education and digital literacy in a non -formal setting through self -paced and personalized learning tools . 
The content caters to children aged 3 to 14 years but the rigor  adjusts to each child’s learning levels. The 
freely accessible tablets provide  contextual and  interactive content in regional languages. PraDig i, a spin 
on the word ‘prodigy’, encourages deeper mastery by promoting group -based learning and assignments 
through shared tablets. PraDigi staff visit villages once a week to assess student prog ress through qualitative 
observational data and to troubleshoot. This allows student progress to be measured holistically.  
 
Intermediate digital skills  programs  – case examples  
Various examples of intermediate digital skills training outside formal education are available, as described 
below and summarized in Table 2. 
 
The ICDL  also offers intermediate digital skills modules.  Although the content was originally oriented at 
the s kills a general office worker needs (word processing, spreadsheet, database and presentation), in 
2013 ICDL was broadened when a number of modules were added like project planning, 2D 
computer aided design, health information systems usage, ICT in educatio n, web editing, image 
editing and digital marketing. The ICDL Profile Certification allows candidates and organizations 
to decide on the combination of programs they wish to implement, according to individuals 
academic, business and job needs. The ICDL Pro file Certificate is issued to the candidate to 
demonstrate the various modules he or she has successfully completed .

 The IC-3 Digital Literacy Certification  is another course which is provided by Certiport (a product of 
Pearson Virtual University Enterpri ses), a for -profit provider of certification exam. These are courses for 
students or employees seeking to pursue a career in IT or  enhance knowledge in the use of technology. The 
course content includes areas related to online usage (internet, browsing, na vigation, email communication, 
digital citizenship, computing fundamentals, managing computer files, computer devices, configuration etc.  
It also covers common applications like word processing, presentations, slide design.  The course can be 
delivered on line or online/offline training, and the certification requires passing three individual exams to 
validate competency.  
 
The Microsoft Digital Literacy Certification is a popular course which is free and open -source.  This is 
targeted to all users with basi c reading skills who want to learn the fundamentals of using digital 
technologies, such as working with computers, accessing information online, communicating online, 
participating safely and responsibly online, creating digital content in word processing,  collaborating and 
managing content digitally. The course can be delivered online self -paced individual study or face to face 
classroom delivery. To obtain the digital literacy certificate, users require to pass 70 percent or higher. The 
biggest advantage of this course is that it is free and is an open -source, unlike the first two examples where 
user fees are charged.  However, a limitation is that the course is linked to a particular vendor’s software 
and may not give sufficient breadth of understanding t o the student.

 Advanced Digital Sk ills for ICT  – case examples  
 
Advanced digital skills training outside the education system (or in partnership with universities) are 
provided by a variety of for -profit providers through on-line and blended programs , and also through rapid 
skills training  (“bootcamps”).  
 
Examples of online and blended programs  are provided in Table 3.   They range across topics like computer 
language programming, artificial intelligence (AI), big data analytics, data science and cloud computing to 
name a few. Due to a wide variety of courses and proficiency levels within these programs, courses are of 
varying lengths . These initiatives are provided in a mix of both formats from purely online programs 
(including paid courses and MOOCs) to in -person training programs.  
 
Rapid training in a dvanced digital skills15 outside the education system, particularly  in the software 
industry, have  recently become very popular.  Such training sessions are usually on current topics that are 
in sudden high demand.   Because the standard c ourses take more time to prepare graduates, universities, 
even in advanced countries, are unable to respond to spikes of demand in certain areas, particularly in 
coding.  Universities can themselves offer such bootcamps over a summer session, but more rece ntly many 
for-profit companies have become active in this type of training, especially when the need is in some of the 
most popular high -level computer languages such as Python, C++, PHP, Java, etc.    
 
However, c oding bootcamps work best for individuals w ho already have background in the structure of 
computer languages but who do not have any experience programming in the particular language that there 
is a demand for.   For these individuals, having someone show them the gist of the language, immediately 
allows them to make connections to their mental (logical) concept of the syntax they expect for a computer 
language.  Learning is then very fast, and within a short time, they are coding very well.  For anyone lacking 
in the underlying structure of how hig h-level languages are constructed, the lessons can be confusing, and 
often frustrating.    
 
Another area where bootcamps are popular is machine learning —a subarea of artificial intelligence; again, 
rapid training courses in this area tend to be more useful  for individuals who have the mathematical 
background relevant to machine learning. This background is found in algebra, particularly in the field of 
matrices. Concepts in manipulating large (two and three dimensional) matrices are key to machine learning.  
The coding of algorithms (into software applications) for performing the manipulations can be meaningless 
if one does not have the conceptual framework on matrices.  
 
The delivery of these programs is best organized in partnership with the private sector to ensure that the 
course meet the requirements of the specific jobs in current demand.

5.3 Challenges in fostering digital skills in Africa  
A special feature of SSA countries is the lack of basic literacy and numeracy skills in a huge section 
of the population, which are essential prerequisites for the acquisition of even the most rudimentary digital 
skills. Self -reported literacy rates among young people are high —for example, 70 percent of young people 
aged 15 -19 report themselves as literate in most countries. But actual reading proficiency tests done in the 
two SSA countries show functional literacy rates to be much lower. Recent studies in SSA countries have 
found that the majority of fourth grade students cannot read a paragraph and close to ninety percent could 
not solve a mathematics world problem; for eighth and ninth -grade students in South Africa, close to half 
of the students did not have basic mathematical knowledge, including adding and subtracting whole 
numbers. Furthermore, over 50 million children under the age of 15 are estimated to be out of school (Bashir 
et al.  2018) . 
The creation of advanced digital skills  for the ICT professions, through engineering, computer 
science and related programs,  is restricted by the low access to post basic education . Across the region, 
enrollment rates in upper secondary education (grades 10 -12) are extremely low. In SSA, the av erage is 
about 28 percent, but in many countries, it is less than 15 percent. In higher education, the gross enrollment 
ratio is below 10 percent. Enrollments in technical -vocational education are below the average in other 
regions. Limited enrollment in m athematics and science streams in lower secondary and upper secondary 
and high failure rates in these subjects restricts the pipeline of those who could enroll in technical, 
professional, mathematics, and science courses in higher education. Estimates indi cate that less than a 
quarter of the small number of students in higher education are in mathematics and science courses. Further, 
gender disparities become acute in upper secondary and higher education, with very few girls participating 
in the technical a nd professional courses that lead to high -end jobs in the digital economy.  
Equally important is the poor quality of courses and teaching in technical -vocational and higher 
education, especially in the technical -professional and mathematics courses.  Lack of  qualified faculty 
is one major issue, with many university faculties  in SSA not having a postgraduate qualification. Even 
more serious is the lack of industry experience, which is especially important in the fast -changing 
environment of digital technologi es. Most universities still offer outdated courses in computer science 
courses, electronics, and telecommunications and information management systems. Key specializations 
that are considered necessary for a broad and deep digital economy are missing: thes e include cybersecurity, 
mobile computing, network and cloud technology, ICT hardware and service infrastructure, IT management 
(ITM), software development and engineering, storage and data, digital multimedia, big data, data analytics, 
artificial intellig ence, and so on.  
Formal education and training institutions are important for preparing the pipeline of young 
workers and citizens for the digital world.  Training opportunities for those who are currently out of 
school or those in the workforce are equall y important. For this enormous stock of the population, there are 
limited opportunities for training and few formal sector firms invest in the training of their workforce. 
Digital technologies may offer the chance to multiply the offerings of training on b asic digital skills which 
are linked to their jobs.  
Migration of high -skilled workers with digital skills can dampen the efforts made by countries to 
increase the supply of workers with advanced and highly specialized digital skills.  African countries 
vary considerably in the levels of economic development as well as the size and maturity of the labor 
market. Some countries with a relatively underdeveloped labor market for advanced and highly specialized 
digital skills (e.g., Lesotho) face risks of their hi gh-skilled worker with digital skills migrating to 
neighboring countries in search for a market that can reward those with such skills (South Africa). While 
there are clear benefits of brain drains (e.g., remittances), the efforts made by countries to fost er digital 
skills may be dampened.

 5.4 Adaptation of existing courses/ programs  for basic digital skills  – is this a feasible option?  
 
Development of new curricula and digital content is expensive and time -consuming. In low capacity 
environments, a choice has to be made between development versus adaptation of existing curricula and 
resources.  However, the costs and effort required for meaningful adaptation must not be underestimated, 
as apart from technical capacity requirements, issues related to copyright, intellectual property and licensing 
costs must be considered.  
For instance, the provision of basic and intermediate digital skills could be based on the ICDL. However, a  
change or extension of the ICDL program is not straight forward because the European C omputer Driving 
Licence ( ECDL ) program is owned and controlled by the ECDL Foundation. The Foundation could be 
approached to know on what terms is would consider collaboration with the Bank (or other actors) on 
developing new modules/subjects. The last upd ate of the ECDL was in 2013, and adaptation could be 
included as part of the next update (the date is not yet known).  
  
It would be preferable to collaborate with the ECDL Foundation and its network of national partners on 
changing and extending the ICDL program. The ICDL certificates seem to be widely recognized by private 
and public employers, and the infrastructure for t eaching and testing is well developed in several countries. 
An alternative system would be costly to establish and to maintain, and (at least in the beginning) it would 
not be known by employers. Before the Bank teams up with the national ICDL system, it w ill however 
require an assessment of the capacity and credibility of the relevant national structures and partner 
organizations.  
 
It would also be useful  to undertake an independent evaluation of the de facto competences of the holders 
of the different lev els of ICDL certificates and of the reliability of the testing system. This could be 
conducted by a qualified research institute.  
 
In general, this would require a regional approach, as it would be expensive to conduct the exercise of 
adaptation on a case by case basis.

 6. Measurement of Digital Skills at Basic and Intermediate Level  
The measurement of digital skills in the population is not done extensively in SSA and is still at a 
nascent stage in most countries. Difficulties of designing and administering the survey, including 
access to devices, posed considerable challenges. Nevert heless, systematic assessment based on 
an accepted framework is required.  Annex 2  provides more details of the issues involved  and 
Appendix Tables C and D  indicate sample questions  from surveys and aggregation of indicators 
by Eurostat.  
 
  Digital Skills: Frameworks and Programs

 Annex 1: Indic ators and Scorecards for Digital Skills in the 
Digital Economy for Africa Initiative  
 
The DE4A initiative proposes two high -level indicators to assess progress  
 
• Percentage of lower -secondary schools with access to internet for pedagogical purposes  (target: all 
lower -secondary schools by 2030)  
• Proportion of youth and adults with advanced digital skills (target: 100% by 2030)  
 
The frameworks used in this paper, the Digital Literacy Global Framework, based on DigComp 2.0/2.1 and 
the EU e -Competence fra meworks, adapted to African contexts - can be used to define different levels of 
digital skills.  
 
Basic digital skills  
A large proportion of young people are still out of lower secondary school, especially in sub -Saharan Africa, 
but also in parts of North Africa, and it would be logistically difficult to provide the same level of basic 
digital skills training to all out of school children, many of whom will lack of foundational literacy and 
numeracy skills. Further, it is impossible to have one test that wi ll measure the performance of all children.  
It is therefore better to consider two indicators for basic skills : 
 
• For children in lower secondary school :  Percentage of children in the terminal year of lower 
secondary education who acquire basic digital sk ills, equivalent to Foundation Level 2 in the 
DigComp Framework.  
 
• For current out -of-school children :  Percentage of children aged 15 years who acquire basic digital 
skills, equivalent to Foundation Level 1 in the DigComp Framework.  
 
Provided that all basic digital skills programs for these children are based on the DigComp Framework, and 
assessments test this level of proficiency, the completion of these programs could be treated as an indicator 
of acquisition of very basic digital sk ills.   
 
For the former group, it is better not to specify the age, as children will be of varying ages due to repetition 
and late entry in primary and lower secondary.  Further, due to the high failure rate in the lower secondary 
examinations, it is prefe rable not to use “completers” but all those who are in the terminal year of the lower 
secondary cycle.  
 
Integration of the basic digital skills program in the lower secondary curriculum and assessment based on 
this would allow collection of data on how ma ny students acquire basic digital skills.  
 
Advanced digital skills (ICT professions and occupations)  
The purpose of this indicator is to identify how African countries are developing the capacity to drive the 
digital economy through ICT and ICT -enabled industries and services. Although it is desirable to assess 
the level of advanced digital skills in the workforce, it is not feasible to do so.  It is feasible t o measure the 
new entrants into this workforce , as represented by the number of  graduates of undergraduate level 
programs in engineering, computer science, mathematics and physics . Ideally the programs would be 
assessed against the EU e -Competence framewor k (proficiency levels e -3 and e -4) or related framework. 
It would also include graduates of online, blended and rapid skills training programs provided such 
programs can also be assessed against the same framework . Digital Skills: Frameworks and Programs

 Annex 2: Measurement of Digital Skills at Basic and 
Intermediate Level  
 
In this section, we cover only digital skills at basic and intermediate level, since the advanced and highly 
specialized skills are typically measured through assessment and certification by the formal education 
provider (university or online provider).  
 
Currently, measures of basic/ intermediate digital skills constitute a small portion of large -scale surveys 
intended to understand ICT usage levels or adult skills of a popula tion.  The principal surveys are indicated 
in the following Annex T able 2.1. 
 
Survey questions assess digital skills in two ways. The first method is based on self -assessment by the 
respondent and is the most commonly used approach. The second method is to  use an indirect form of 
assessment, by posing questions about the types applications that the respondent can use.  
For example, when an individual uses an application that is conceived to be difficult to use, this is held to 
be an indication of a high lev el of skills (Deursen et al.  2014). Sample questions from such indirect 
assessments can be found in Appendix Table  C. 
 
The DigComp 2.1 Framework is used to guide the identification of a limited set of indicators for the 
purposes of measurement of digital c ompetence within the EU (and a number of other countries for 
comparative purposes) through an ICT survey about activities realized during the previous 3 months within 
four domains: information, communication, content creation and problem solving. It is ass umed that 
persons having realized certain activities (e.g. copying or moving a file or a folder or using copy and paste 
tools to duplicate or move information within a document) have the corresponding skills. However, as the 
data is self -reported, they are  likely to be positively biased.  
 
The Eurostat indicators are simple (the indicators for all the domains are listed in Appendix Table D. At the 
overall level the digital skill indicator defines four levels of skills: no, low, basic and above basic; whereb y:  
• ‘No’ refers to individuals who answered none in all categories, plus those who have not used the 
internet in the last 12 months or who have never used the internet;  
• ‘Low’  refers to individuals having one or more ‘none’ in three domains;  
• ‘Basic’  refers to individuals having one or more ‘basic’, but no ‘none’;  
• ‘Above basic’  refers to individuals with ‘above basic’ in all four domains.  
 
A similar simple indicator for digital skills would be appropriate for measuring at the population level in 
Africa. Such an indicator could be inspired by the indicators and aggregation methods used by Eurostat to 
measure digital skills. However, the indicators must be ‘Africanized’ as some of them are more relevant to 
PC users in Europe than to users of smartphones in Afric a (e.g. copying or moving files or using a formula 
within a spreadsheet).  
 
Most of the basic and intermediate digital skills programs listed above administer performance tests with 
the purpose of certifying the level of digital skills. Examples of most com monly used certification programs 
include Microsoft Digital Literacy Standard Curriculum, CISCO Networking Academy, International 
Computer Driving Licence (ICDL), Internet and Computing Core Certification (IC³) Digital Literacy 
Certification, etc.
