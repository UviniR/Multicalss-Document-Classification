Abstract  
Purpose : The research was  to establish teachers ' attitud e towards integrating ICT in classroom  
instruction   
Methods:  The study was carried out in secondary schools of the southern region, Eritrea. A 
descriptive survey research design was adopted. The study targeted 27 public secondary schools 
in the region. Str atified random sampling technique was used to get a sample of 12 secondary 
schools from 12 sub-regions. The sample of respondents of the study was drawn from thes e 12 
secondary schools of 12  sub-regions. The respondents were 12 school directors, 34 Biology  
teachers and 175 grade eleven students. Questionnaires, interview and observation schedules 
were used as instruments for data collection. Questionnaire for Biology teachers and students, 
Interview Schedule for school Directors , were employed. Piloting and  consultation were 
conducted to establish validity and reliability before the instruments were used for the actual data 
collection. The data collected included both qualitative and quantitative data. The quantitative 
data were  analyzed using Statistical  Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The qualitative data 
obtained f rom the open -ended questions were  analyzed thematically based on research 
objectives .  
Results:  The study found that majority of Biology teachers who participated in the study had a 
positive attitude towards the use of ICT in teaching and learning. They liked to use ICT in their 
Biology lessons; they believed ICT makes learning Biology interesting, understandable and 
improves learners' performance   
Unique Contribution to Theory, Practice and P olicy:  The study recommended that Ministry 
of Education should provide adequate in -service training on ICT integration skills for teachers   
Key Words:  Teachers' Attitude, ICT Integration , Classroom Instruction

1.0 INTRODUCTION  
Attitude is one of the teacher 's factor s that affect the use of ICT in the classroom . Having a 
positive attitude is crucial in integrating ICT in education . Muslem, Yusuf and  Juliana (2018)  
conducted a study on attitude and barriers to ICT use amo ng English teachers in Indonesia. The 
study used a questionnaire and interview for 26 teachers selected by purposive sampling 
technique. The finding s of the study show ed that participant teachers had positive perceptions of 
the implementation of ICT in classroom teaching and learning. Teachers believe  that ICT support 
them in their lessons as well as helps them to find information that enriches their lessons easily 
and qu ickly.  They also think that ICT makes teaching in the class more interesting.  
Hong (2016)  carried out a study on teachers’ views of ICT integration using open -ended, semi -
structured interview for 23 teachers from different parts of Colorado, USA. The study revealed 
that teacher s involved in the study had a positive attitude  towards ICT as an instructional tool . 
They liked ICT as a pedagogical tool and as a resource bank for their teaching. Teachers wanted 
to learn new ways of using ICT to deliver instructional materials to stude nts effectively and 
showed their willingness to incorporate ICT in their lessons frequently. This is because they 
believed that ICT is a current trend , and it has many benefits for students. Further, the study 
found that low availability of ICT resources , especially the availability of computers and 
unreliable internet connection were major barriers that limited the implementation of ICT in  the 
classroom.  
Daher,  Baya’a and Anabousy  (2018)  conducted a n experimental study on in -service M athematics 
teachers' integration of ICT as innovative practice in lower secondary  and found out that the 
teachers h ad positive attitudes and  beliefs.  Despite  their positive feeling s, teachers were reluctant 
to integrate technology in their lessons due to their little experience and different obstacles they 
encountered in  the integration of ICT in education.  
According to the study carried out by  Semerci and Aydın ( 2018)  on examining high school 
teachers’ attitudes towards ICT use in education, applying descriptive res earch design and 
questionnaire for 353 teachers working in different schools of Ankara, turkey. Teachers 
displayed a high level of positive attitude towards ICT use in education and low level of anxiety 
towards ICT use in education.  
Adegbenro, Gumbo  and Olakanmi  (2017)  investigated in -service secondary school teachers’ 
technology integration needs i n an ICT enhanced classroom in Pretoria , South Africa using 
Questionnaire and focus group discussion. The  finding of the study revealed that teachers had 
positive attitudes towards using computers in their classrooms. Teachers were willing to learn 
more ab out how to integrate computers in the teaching and learning processes. However, 
teachers faced difficulties in the implementation of ICT in classroom practices due to their 
inadequate knowledge and lacked skills to use ICT in their pedagogical practices. According to 
Ottestad (2013) , an online survey was done on 247 school leaders , and 386 teachers from 
Norwegian primary and lower secondary  schools  revealed that there was a correlation between 
the attitude and behavio r of school leaders and the a ttitude and behavio r of teachers regarding  
ICT integration in classroom practices.  Journal of Education  and Practice

 A study conducted by Msila (2015)  in South Africa, using an interview to explore the view of 
teachers on digital technology use in instruction. Findings showed that younger teachers were 
more open -minded than the older teachers who found the introduction of  ICT discouraging. In 
the end, the study concluded that the success of digital technology in classrooms depend s more 
on teacher competence as well as positive attitudes towards ICT.  Similarly , a study conducted on  
pre-service Biology teachers attitude toward the use of ICT in Biology teaching revealed  that 
pre-service Biology teachers had a positive attitude with no difference in gender or class  (Yapici 
and Heved anli 2012) . The p resence of a positive attitude in teachers enhances the use of ICT in 
instruction.  However, least was known about Biology teachers’ attitude toward s the  integration 
of ICT in teaching and learn ing in the S outhern Region's secondary schools in Eritrea . 
Statement of the Problem  
The use of technology has influenced all human aspects of life , and it has an impact on how 
education is delivered. The Government of Eritrea , through the Ministry of E duca tion, has placed 
effort in introducing a new curriculum that focuses on learner -centered, outcome -based 
interactive pedagogy. The new curriculum allows learners to actively participate in their 
learning. In addition to this, ICT policy in education has bee n launched for integrating ICT in 
education. While studying B iology is important for it generally helps us to get a  better 
understanding about ourselves , the world and its natural processes, the performance of this 
subject in secondary schools in Eritrea was not satisfactory  in the last five years . The 
performance of Biology , as indicated in table 1.1 , was poor in the last five years. This can have a 
serious implication for the quality of education and discourage students from studying Biology. 
This problem  of low performance could be solved by integrating I CT in teaching and learning of 
Biology.  
Various researches conducted on ICT integration in education have proved that integrating ICT 
in teaching and learning improve s the quality of learning and perform ance of learners. Moreover, 
ICT integration simplifies abstract and complex concepts, create s cooperative learning, and 
create s interest in learning among students . In essence, integration of ICT creates a learner -
centered learning environment. Although the integration of ICT has many benefits that can be 
considered as opportunities, it also has numerous challenges. It demands educational 
transformation such as changing curriculum, assessment , and importantly changing role of 
teachers from being c ustodians of knowledge to being facilitator s in pedagogy.  
The effective integration  of ICT in teaching and learning requires the availability of ICT 
resources, Teachers' preparedness on ICT integration, and attitude of teachers towards ICT 
integration in teaching -learning . However,  it is not clear whether Biology teachers integrate  ICT 
in the classroom instruction  with the purpose of improving teaching and learning of biology . 
This study,  therefore , intended to examine the integration of ICT in teaching and learning  of 
Biology in the Southern R egion of Eritrea . 
2.0 METHODOLOGY  
This study used a descriptive survey research design.  The study took place  in the Southern  
Region Eritrea.  The t arget population for the study comprised 27 public secondary schools of the 
southern region, 27 school directors, 78 Biology teachers and 1664 grade eleven  Biology Journal of Education  and Practice

 students of secondary schools  of the southern region, Eritrea.  In this study, stratified, purposive 
sampling and simple random sampling techniques were used. Stratified  sampling was used to 
determine a sample of 12 schools from 27 public secondary schools.  The school directors of the 
sampled schools were purposively selected to participate in the study.  Simple random sampling 
technique was further applied to obtain Biolo gy teachers and 10.5% of students of grade eleven, 
making 175 students from the sampled school. From the sampled sch ool, three (3) Biology 
teachers, one teacher from the list of teachers who teach grade 9, grade 10 and grade 11 was 
randomly picked to parti cipate in the study . The sample size of the study comprised of 221  
secondary schools, school directors, Biology teachers and students . Three-research instrument s 
were  used for data collection : questionnaire, interview and observation schedule.  The data 
collected include d both qualitative and quantitative data.  The quantitative data collected from the  
sampled secondary schools using teachers' questionnaire, students' questionnaire  interview and 
observation schedule s were organized, cleaned, coded and entered  into a computer program 
Statistical  Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for analysis. The quantitative data were analyzed 
using desc riptive statistics such as mean and percentages . The data were presented in the form of 
tables and figures such as percentag es, bar graphs  and pie charts.

 Source: School Directors' Interview  
The sampled school directors had varied professional experience  in the current post  as indicated 
in table 2.  One-third of the directors (33.3  %) had less than  or equal to  five years  of experience, 
41.7% had between 6 and 10 years of experience. Other 16.7 % of the directors had between 11 -
15 years of experience, and 8.3% had between 16 and 20 years of experience. This shows that 
most of the school directors  (75%) had professional experience of less than ten  years.  
4.1.2 Demographic Information of Biology Teachers   
This section presents the demographic information of B iology teachers involved in the study. 
Teachers were the main targets of the study because teachers mainly implement ICT integration. 
The demographic data explored were gender, age, teaching experience, computer literacy , class 
size and workload of teachers.  
a) Gender composition of teachers  
The composition of teachers based on their gender was as presented in figure 1

The finding in figure 1 shows the gender composition of teachers who participated in the study. 
The greater part (70.6%) of the respondents were male teachers, and the remaining (29.4%) were 
female teachers. This shows that both male and female teachers participated in the study . 
b) Age distribution of teachers  
Age distribution of teachers was integrated into the study. The sampled teachers of Biology had 
varied distribution of age , as indicated  in figure 2.

Figure 2. Age distribution of teachers  
Source: Teachers' Questionnaire  
Figure 2 shows 47.1% of the teachers were aged between 20 and 30 years, followed by 26.5% 
aged between 41 and 50 years. Another 23.5% were aged between 31 and 40 years. There was 
only one teacher aged above 50 years in the sampled schools. Majority of the  teachers (70.6%) 
fall in the age range of 20 and 40 years. This shows most teachers that participated  in the study 
were at young were they could easily accept the use of technology in their teaching.  
c) Teachers ' professional experience  
The experience of teachers in their teaching profession was considered in the study. The 
distribution was as presented in table 2.

 teachers  had experience of between 3 and 4 years, and 11 .8% of teachers had the experience of 
between 7 and 8 years. The study  found that the majority of  the participant teachers were novice 
of 1-2 years and above 9 years of experiences. This show s that the  teachers had different  years of 
experiences in teaching .  
d) Computer Literacy of teachers   
The researcher sought information on computer literacy level s among Biology teachers. The 
Findings were as illustrated in Table 3.

From table 3, out of the 34 teachers of Biology, 91.2% had computer literacy training, while 
8.8% had no computer literacy  training . This shows that majority of  Biology teachers  had 
received computer literacy training,  though the training was not adequate to have compe tency in 
computer.  
e) Teachers ' workload  
The w orkload is the number of periods the teacher teaches in a week. The lowest and highest  
periods  that the teachers had were 15 a nd 32 , respectively. The mean of periods that a teacher 
had was 23 in a week.  If teachers have a heavy workload, it can be a barrier to prepare ICT based 
classroom lessons.  
f)  Class size in B iology classrooms  
Class size is the number of student s in a classroom in a Biology lesson.  From the sampled 
schools, the minimum class size was 46 , and the maximum was 73  students  in a Biology 
classroom . The average number of students per class in the sampled schools was 64. This is too 
large to manage the student s' activity in the  technology -enhanced learner -centered  classroom  
instruction . In large  class size, to use ICT and leaner -centered learning could be a challenge.  
4.1.3 Demographic Information of Students    
This section presents the demographic  information of students  involved in the study. The 
demogr aphic data explored were gender and computer  literacy.  
a) Gender Distribution of Students

shows that majority of the stude nts had attended in computer training.  
4.2 Teachers Attitude towards Integrating ICT in the Instruction of Biology  
The study sought to establish the attitude  of Biology  teachers towards the integration of ICT in 
teaching and learning  of Biology.  The attit ude of teachers was measured in Likert scale, ranging 
from strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree and strongly disagree in the statements that 
determine the teachers' attitude as illustrated in table 4.

that ICT makes teaching and lear ning interesting. The study also showed that  majority (58.8% ) 
of Biology teachers strongly agreed followed by 35.3 % who agreed to the statement "Integration 
of ICT in Biology lessons improves students' performance in Biology national examinations," 
wherea s 5.9% of teachers were neutral. For the statement "Students in this school like the use of 
ICT in Biology lessons," it was indicated that 29.4%, of teaches strongly agreed and 38.2% of 
them agreed together constituting 67.6% while few teachers 11.8% disag reed and strongly 
disagreed. However, 20.6% of teachers were neutral to that.  
Majority of teachers 55.9% strongly agreed , and 35.3% agreed that ICT makes the students to be 
active in the Biology lessons. The study found out that 35.3% of teachers strongly  agreed, 44.1% 
of teachers agreed that much content is covered within a short time when ICT is used in Biology 
lessons. However, 11.8% of the teachers responded neutral ly. The few teachers who strongly 
disagreed and disagreed comprise 8.8%.   
In each of th e statement, teachers either agreed or strongly agreed. This shows that majority of 
the teachers had a positive attitude towards the integration of ICT in teaching and learning. 
Findings from other researches revealed that teachers believe that ICT could b e used as a 
pedagogical tool in improving their teaching when there are adequate resources and Journal of Education  and Practice

 infrastructures  (Ndibalema, 2014) . And a Positive attitude of teachers toward s the integration  of 
ICT in education has been seen as an important factor to encourage teachers to use ICT in their 
classroom  (Player -Koro, 2012) . 
In addition to the attitude of teachers,  as the beneficiaries of the ICT integration,  the study also 
looked at  the attitude of students towards the use of ICT in Biology learning. Table 5 shows the 
attitude of students towards the integration of ICT in teaching and learning.

As presented in table4.12 , over 90% of students strongly agreed and agreed  that ICT can help to 
improve students' performance in Biology, few students (3.4%) disagreed, and another few 
students (3.4%) were neutral.  The study found that 25.1% of respondents agreed, 20 % st rongly 
agreed that teachers of Biology like using ICT when teaching Biology. However, 39.4% of the 
respondents were neutral to that, whereas 8.6% the students strongly disagreed and 6.9% of the 
respondents disagreed with the statement.  
For the statement, " Students easily understand Biology when ICT resources are used" 51.4% of 
students strongly agreed. They were seconded by 33.1% of students who agreed, however , 
10.9% were neutral. Little percentage (4.6%) of students strongly disagreed and disagreed.   
Majo rity, more than 80% of students strongly agreed and agreed that ICT makes learning 
interesting to students, 6.9% of the students were neutral, whereas 6.9% of them disagreed, only 
2.9% of the students responded strongly disagree.  
The study found that 58.9%  of students strongly agreed, 32.0% of respondents agreed, only 2.3% 
of students strongly disagreed that students like the use of ICT in Biology lessons, whereas 6.3% 
of respondents were neutral in their responses.  This shows that the majority of students had a 
positive attitude towards the use of ICT in biology  learning.  
Majority of the interviewed school directors said that  teachers in their schools had a positive 
attitude towards ICT integration. Teachers like using ICT and believe ICT makes teaching and  
learning more interesting. Few school directors were not able to decide about teachers' attitude.  Journal of Education  and Practice

 One school director was quoted in saying that:  
Without providing ICT resources necessary for teaching and learning  their subject, 
giving them adequate trai ning on how to integrate ICT in  biology teaching and without 
observing them using ICT in their  classrooms, it is not easy to judge about teachers' 
attitude towards ICT  integration in teaching and learning. (School Director No.9, 2018) . 
Based  on the quot ation of the school director, it was difficult to measure teachers' attitude 
towards the integration of ICT in Biology lessons before providing the requirements.  
The school directors were also asked to give their view  on how they see the integration o f ICT in 
teaching and learning. Majority of them believe d ICT would improve the quality of teaching and 
learning. However, few responded that computer and internet could take the attention of students 
away from their Biology learning.  When school directors  have a positive attitude towards ICT 
integration in schools, they can give the necessary support for teachers in using ICT in their 
lessons. Teachers, students and school directors involved in the study showed a  positive attitude 
towards the integration o f ICT in teaching and learning process. The findings of this study were 
in ag reement with several research  studies. A study conducted by  Semerci and Aydın  (2018)  on 
examining high school teachers’ attitudes towards ICT use  in education, applying descriptive 
research design and questionnaire for 353 teachers working in different schools of Ankara, 
turkey. Teachers displayed a high level of positive attitude towards ICT use in education and low 
level of anxiety towards ICT us e in education.  
Hong (201 6) carried out a study on teachers’ views of ICT integration using open -ended, semi -
structured interview for 23 teachers from different parts of Colorado, USA. The study revealed 
that teachers involved in the study had a positive attitude towards ICT as  an instructional tool . A 
study conducted on  pre-service Biology teachers attitude toward the use of ICT in Biology 
teaching, the result revealed that pre -service Biology teachers had a positive attitude with no 
difference in gender or class (Yapici and Hevedanli, 2012) . 
Although a positive attitude towards ICT is one of the factors for the integration of ICT in 
education, having a positive attit ude alone is not enough for ICT integration in teaching and 
learning. Adegbenro, Gumbo  and O lakanmi (2017)   ascertained that teachers had positive 
attitudes towards using computers in their classrooms. Teachers were willing to learn more about 
how to integrate computers in the teaching and learning processes. However, teachers faced 
difficulti es in the implementation of ICT in classroom practices due to their inadequate 
knowledge and lacked skills to use ICT in their pedagogical practices.  
4.0 SUMMARY,  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  
4.1 Summary  
In the study, it was revealed that majority of B iology teachers who participated in the study had a 
positive attitude towards the use of ICT in teaching and learning. They liked to use ICT in their 
Biology lessons; they believed ICT makes learning Biology interesting, understandable and 
improves learner s' performance. In addition, the study revealed that the attitude of the majority of  
school directors and students was also positive towards the use of ICT in education.Even though 
a positive attitude existed in the schools' community, ICT was not applied for teaching and Journal of Education  and Practice

 learning of Biology. This could be due to other barriers that influenced ICT integration in 
instruction.  
4.2 Conclusion s 
The study concluded  that majority of Biology teachers who participated in the study had positive 
attitudes towards th e use of ICT in teaching and learning. The attitude of school directors and 
students was also positive towards the use of ICT in education. Though the attitude of teachers 
and school directors was positive, ICT was not integrated into instruction. From thi s, it is logical 
to conclude that having a positive attitude alone could not make ICT integration practical in the 
classrooms.  
4.3 Recommendations  
The study recommended that Ministry of Education should provide adequate in -service training 
on ICT integration skills for teachers
