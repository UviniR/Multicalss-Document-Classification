Abstract
This article offers insights into the ownership and use of mobile devices (smart-
phones and tablets) among Indonesian middle and high school students. The study isbased on primary data collected from a survey of 1,157 students at two middle
schools and two high schools from two different regions in Indonesia. Data analysis
includes multiple correspondence analysis and logistic regression models. The find-ings show that both ownership and use of mobile devices varies significantly among
students of different sex, age, location, and most importantly socioeconomic
status. This article also reports the use of mobile apps in three separate categories(i.e., educational apps, social media, and mobile games), showing some differences
in duration and frequency of mobile apps use between different group of students.
These findings can serve as a foundation for further research on how mobiletechnology can be used to improve educational attainment in Indonesia and other
developing countries.

Introduction
As the fourth most populous country in the world, the archipelago nation of
Indonesia is a promising market for mobile technology. By early 2015,
mobile connections in Indonesia already outnumbered the total populationitself (309.2 million vs. 255.5 million) placing Indonesia ahead of many devel-
oped countries regarding the number of mobile connections per capita (Kemp,
2015). This number is predicted to go even higher as the growth rate of mobilesubscriptions in Indonesia is calculated as 9% annually (Kemp, 2017).Indonesian people also use their mobile devices to access the Internet more
than people in most countries: Half of the web trafﬁc in Indonesia comes
from mobile devices, compared with the global average of 33%. At the sametime, Internet penetration increased signiﬁcantly from 15% (Kemp, 2014) to
51% (Kemp, 2017) in Indonesia, placing Indonesia as the country with highest
growth in Internet user by 2017 (Kemp, 2017).
Despite the increasing access to both personal computers and mobile devices
over time, a problem of inequality persists. Also known as digital divide, a term
that was ﬁrst coined in late 20th century, this problem has been well researched(Norris, 2001; Pratama & Al-Shaikh, 2012; Sidorenko & Findlay, 2001).
Some studies conﬁrm the existence of a digital divide between race, age, and
sex (Colley & Comber, 2003; Jackson et al., 2008), while others argue thatincome or socioeconomic status (SES) is the most important factor of a digitaldivide (Calvert, Rideout, Woolard, Barr, & Strouse, 2005; Chinn & Fairlie,
2007). Differences in use patterns seem to be dynamic: In studies where the
gap was narrowed, it nevertheless remained among some groups of people.For example, males were signiﬁcantly more likely to be heavier users of personal
computers until the gap with females narrowed in 1992 (Rocheleau, 1995).
A qualitative study comparing the availability of, access to, and use of com-puters in a group of low and high SES high school in California shows thatstudents in high SES high school have a better overall experience, even when the
student–computer ratios in both schools were similar (Warschauer, Knobel, &
Stone, 2004). A nationwide survey by Pew Research Center in the United Statesshowed the overall Internet adoption rates have leveled off by 2012 comparedwith the previous survey in 2000. However, it is not the same case with the use
rates as those who were already online were doing more than those who just
started (Zickuhr & Smith, 2012).
On many occasions, researchers have tried to investigate the relationship
between mobile devices and education. Some studies suggest the use of mobiledevices can help improve the quality of education, either by supporting academ-
ic growth and empowerment (Mouza & Barrett-Greenly, 2015) or by enhancing
learning attitudes and learning achievements of the students (Hwang, Wu, & Ke,2011; Martin & Ertzberger, 2013). Furthermore, many mobile learning activitieshave been scientiﬁcally proven to have a positive relationship with education2 Journal of Educational Technology Systems 0(0)attainment. For example, the use of e-books to replace traditional printed text-
books is associated with higher perceived affective and psychomotor learning
(Rockinson-Szapkiw, Courduff, Carter, & Bennett, 2013). Mobile devices canalso allow students to do some out-of-class learning activities as opposed to
learning in front of computer within a lab, hence increasing students’ willingness
to continue to engage in learning (Sung & Mayer, 2013). Furthermore, mobiledevices can be used to track and monitor the time devoted to self-regulated
learning that improves students’ time management skills (Tabuenca, Kalz,
Drachsler, & Specht, 2015).
On the other hand, some studies suggest that mobile devices can sometimes
hinder educational attainment. Studies highlighting the problematic use of
mobile devices tend to focus primarily on addiction (Kamibeppu & Sugiura,2005; Ozkan & Solmaz, 2015; Walsh, White, & Young, 2008). Excessive use of
mobile devices is associated with psychological distress (Beranuy, Oberst,
Carbonell, & Chamarro, 2009) or may even lead to the occurrence of cognitivefailures such as lower working memory capacity and poorer attentional control
in daily life (Hadlington, 2015).
Therefore, the relationship between mobile technology and education
appears to be like a double-edged sword: It can have both favorable and unfa-
vorable consequences. However, looking more closely at the previous studies,
the problematic use of mobile devices tends to be the result of obsessive overuse.One may argue that too much of anything, no matter how good it is, is usually
bad. Furthermore, looking at the cases where mobile devices have a supportive
relationship toward education, all the activities with mobile devices are basicallydone by design. Mobile devices by themselves do not help with educational
attainment; yet using mobile devices in some designated scenario, whether
formal or informal, can. Therefore, to get the most beneﬁt of integratingmobile devices into the educational environment, educators must ﬁrst determine
the activities and conditions for their use.
While results from other studies done in different parts of the world can
provide a good insight of what the state of the art is in this ﬁeld, most of
them are focused on developed countries and nothing much has been learned
in the case of Indonesia. Considering all the cultural and demographicdifferences in Indonesia, along with its huge population and vastly growing
information and communication technology (ICT) use and mobile penetration,
it is a good idea to explore what the case is directly in this country. This kind ofexploratory study is necessary before one can go further with some sort of
proposed method in optimizing the use of mobile devices for educational pur-
poses. This article presents ﬁndings from a larger PhD study (Pratama, 2019).Its primary contribution is to identify patterns, conﬁrm important factors, and
point out signiﬁcant differences in ownership and use of mobile devices
among Indonesian adolescents. These ﬁndings also have implications forother developing nations that are also trying to enhance their educationalPratama and Scarlatos 3attainment through ICT utilization. As a previous study at a cross-country level
suggests, the higher participation rate in educational system of a country, par-ticularly in secondary and tertiary level, the higher its ICT utilization rate is.
This, in turn, is also associated with better education outcomes of the said
country (Pratama, 2017). A better understanding of ownership and use ofmobile devices, which is a major part of ICT utilization nowadays, from a
country that shares some cultural similarities or the same infrastructure prob-
lems and challenges would be of assistance for such a quest.
Research Design, Methodology, and Samples
This study employs a multiple-case design, involving students from severaldifferent schools selected to account for differences in location and education
level. As is true in many other countries, there is a problem with regional
inequality in Indonesia. Studies have conﬁrmed the existence of inequalitybetween urban and rural areas as well as between those who live in Java
(the most populous island, home to about 46% of Indonesians) and those
who live in other islands. People living in urban areas generally enjoy abetter life than those who live in rural areas; so do people who live in Javaisland compared with those who live in other islands (Akita, Lukman, &
Yamada, 1999; Suryadarma, Widyanti, Suryahadi, & Sumarto, 2006).
Because signiﬁcantly more people in Java live in urban areas (StatisticsIndonesia, 2014), the location factors were combined by selecting a school
located in urban Java to be compared with another school in rural non-
Java, thus reducing t he number of schools required for the study. In terms
of education level, the Indonesian education system embraces 6 years of sec-
ondary education that are split equally between middle school and high school,
with 3 years in each. By the end of the third year in each level, there is aNational Exam used to determine whether students can graduate from their
current education level and if they are eligible to continue to the next educa-
tion level.
An anonymous paper-based survey was conducted in two middle schools
and two high schools in Indonesia, one for each urban Java and rural non-Java area, within the ﬁrst quarter of 2016. The survey was ﬁlled out by the
students in class settings during school hours. As English is not the native
language of Indonesian people, the questionnaire was delivered in BahasaIndonesia instead. Students were selected by using stratiﬁed random sam-
pling at class level based on school, grade, sex, and major for the 11th and
12th graders only. The comparison between collected samples and the actualpopulation is shown in Figure 1. After dealing with missing values, a total of
1,157 students participated in the study, equal to 97.15% response rate.
They ranged from 13 to 19 years of age ( M¼15.80, SD¼1.71).
Participants were then categorized based on self-perceived ICT adoption4 Journal of Educational Technology Systems 0(0)level representing their attitude toward ICT (124 early adopters, 10.71%; 760
majorities, 65.63%; and 274 laggards, 23.66%) and SES measured by the
purchase price of their devices (124 high SES, 10.71% and 1,034 middle-to-
low SES, 89.29%).
Results and Discussion
Device Ownership
Students participating in this study were asked if they own each of the following
digital devices: (a) desktop, (b) laptop, (c) smartphone, and (d) tablet. Table 1
shows the descriptive statistics of this device ownership information, categorized
by each of the independent variables (i.e., sex, age, school, education level,
location, SES, attitude toward ICT, and year in school). Meanwhile, Figure 2
shows the comparison of device ownership rate with similar statistics from the
United States. As the data indicate, smartphone and laptop are the most pop-
ular devices among Indonesian students, and the ownership rate for these two
devices is signiﬁcantly higher than those of American people.
The logistic regression estimates for each device ownership in Table 2 show
that the model is statistically signiﬁcant for all four devices. From these results,
male students are more likely to own desktop than female students, while the
opposite is true for tablet, which is more favorable toward female students.
Meanwhile, laptop and smartphone tend to be sex agnostic. Student’s attitudes
toward ICT adoption are positively correlated with device ownership in three
models; those who consider themselves as early adopters in ICT are more likely
Figure 1. Comparison between population and sample based on school, grade, and sex.Pratama and Scarlatos 5to own digital devices than those who consider themselves as majority, while
those who consider themselves as laggard are the ones who are less likely to ownany digital devices. This variable is not signiﬁcant only in laptop ownershipmodel while being the only signiﬁcant predictor in smartphone ownershipmodel. The former might have something to do with the fact that manyschools in Indonesia do not have good computer lab infrastructure and askTable 1. Descriptive Statistics of Device Ownership.

that students who do not own a smartphone probably do not because of their
personal preference (i.e., less favorable attitudes toward ICT) rather than any
other reasons.
Regarding SES, students with high SES are more likely to own desktop,
laptop, or tablet than students with lower SES. This does not apply to smart-phone ownership, and this further conﬁrms the status of smartphone as the most
favorable computing device for Indonesian students regardless of their SES. In
terms of location, students in urban Java are more likely to own a personalcomputer, whether it is a desktop or laptop, than students in rural non-Java. As
for education level, high school students are more likely to own a personal
computer, whether it is a desktop or a laptop, than middle school students.
Likewise, students in a higher grade are more likely to own the same devices
than students in a lower grade.
On the other hand, younger students, holding all other variables including
education level and grade constant, are more likely to own some devices, par-
ticularly desktop and tablet, than older students. This ﬁnding is particularlyinteresting because age is highly correlated to both grade and education level
(i.e., students in a higher grade are likely older than students in a lower grade).
However, it is important to note that there can be age differences betweenstudents in the same grade and education level in Indonesia’s schools;
Figure 2. Comparison of ownership rate between Indonesian students in this study and
American students and adults in 2015–2016.
Source . *Pearson Student Mobile Device Survey, 2015; **Pew Research Center, April 2016.Pratama and Scarlatos 7apparently, older students are less likely to own devices than younger students in
the same grade. While the data are not enough to explain why this is, there couldbe some other factors at play, such as parents’ age and what the student’s birthorder is in the family. It is possible that older students in the same grade are theyoungest child of much older parents (and therefore started school later), where-
as their younger classmates are the oldest child of younger parents. Having
parents from a younger generation who are more technologically literatecould be the important factor driving for a more favorable condition ofdevice ownership for these students.
The model for smartphone ownership has only one signiﬁcant predictor,
while there are at least four signiﬁcant predictors in the model of the other
three devices. In the desktop ownership model, all six predictors are signiﬁcant.This result indicates that smartphone is indeed the universal device to have forthese students regardless of their demographic characteristics. The only thingthat matters is their attitudes toward ICT.Table 2. Logistic Regression Estimates of Device Ownership.

devices suggests the need for similar analysis of device bundle ownership. Out of16 possible device bundles that can be from out of four devices to own, fourmajor types of bundles were identiﬁed, as shown in Figure 3. These four majorbundles (i.e., all four devices, desktop–laptop–smartphone, tablet–laptop–smartphone, and laptop–smartphone) account for 87.55% of total students,leaving only 6.22% who own no more than one device, 5.96% who own anyother bundles, and 0.26% who own none of these four devices at all.
Meanwhile, Table 3 shows the logistic regression estimates for device bundle
ownership. The bundle ownership model is statistically signiﬁcant for the all-four-device bundle as well as the no bundle. From these results, male studentsare more likely to own the three-device bundle without tablet than female stu-dents, while the opposite is true for the three-device bundle with a tablet, whichis more favorable toward female students. Meanwhile, just like in the deviceownership analysis for each one of them, the laptop and smartphone bundletends to be sex agnostic. Student’s attitudes toward ICT adoption variable are astrong predictor only in the all-four-device bundle and the nonbundle owner-ship. Those who consider themselves as early adopters are more likely to be theowner of all-four-device bundle, while those who consider themselves as
Figure 3. Groups of students based on device bundle ownership.Pratama and Scarlatos 9laggards are more likely to own one device only, which, combined with the
previous ﬁndings, is most likely to be a smartphone. In terms of SES, students
with high SES are more likely to own any bundle with a tablet in it than anyother bundle without a tablet, which is more favorable by students with middle-to-low SES. Again, combined with the previous ﬁndings, it is most likely due tothe strong correlation between tablet and high SES, to begin with.
Regarding the location, students in urban Java are more likely to own bun-
dles with a desktop than students in rural non-Java. One of the most plausiblereasons is that it is easier and cheaper for those living in urban Java to buydesktop computers than those living in rural non-Java. It could also be becausethe supporting infrastructures, such as ﬁxed broadband (e.g., asymmetric digitalsubscriber line, Fiber) and wireless (Wi-Fi) Internet connection in Java are much
better than in non-Java. This ﬁnding is also supported by another section in theTable 3. Logistic Regression Estimates of Device Bundle Ownership.

the third device, while female students, students with high SES, and studentsfrom the rural non-Java area are more likely to add tablet as the third device in

Students who own mobile devices (i.e., smartphone or tablet) were asked the
following: (a) How many hours a day they spend on their mobile device, and (b)how often they use apps in three separate categories: social media, educational,
and mobile gaming? The survey listed 15 to 25 of the most frequently down-
loaded apps in Indonesia, in both iOS and Android platforms for each category.Subjects were asked to indicate whether they have installed the apps on their
mobile device, and how often they use each of those apps (monthly, weekly,
daily) if installed. Table 4 shows how the use of apps was originally measured inthe survey, and how it was coded differently for further analysis in this chapter.

Students who use at least one app in the category at least once a week areconsidered regular users of that category. Those who use at least one app inthe category on a daily basis are considered heavy users. All heavy users areregular users, but not all regular users are heavy users. Table 8 shows the sum-mary of regular and heavy users as well as the ratio between them for eachcategory. It is quite clear that these students use signiﬁcantly more social mediathan any other apps categories on their mobile device. It is also found that theyplay games signiﬁcantly less than they use educational apps. A series of two-sample tests of proportion between each pair of apps categories (i.e., educationvs. games, education vs. social, and games vs. social) are used to conﬁrm thesigniﬁcant difference in use between these three categories and the results showconsistency for both regular and heavy users.Table 8.

Note. The italicized values are the percentage of said users compared to all users.
Figure 5. Regular users of social media, games, and educational apps with the intersection of
each category.Pratama and Scarlatos 15Social media apps have the highest ratio of regular to heavy users, indicating
a very strong level of engagement in that 98% of the regular users are also heavy
users. On the other hand, while the ratio for educational apps and games are notas high as social media apps, they both still indicate a strong level of engagement
at 73% and 63%, respectively. In other words, most regular users for any cat-
egories use the apps on a daily basis instead of weekly basis.
Being a regular or heavy user in one category does not necessarily mean the
same thing for another category. To get a better look at this overlapping use of
apps in three different categories, the next step is to look at the intersections ofeach category. Two customized bar charts were generated in R with the help
of the UpSetR library (Gehlenborg, 2017) as shown in Figures 5 and 6 for
regular users and heavy users, respectively. As indicated by these diagrams,the use in three apps categories overlaps a lot, especially for regular use. As
for heavy use, a signiﬁcant number of users are identiﬁed as exclusively heavy
users for only social media apps, almost 3 times as much as it is in regular users.
These diagrams help uncover some valuable information. First, almost half
of the students use only social media and educational apps together, either on a
daily basis or weekly basis. Second, more than a third of these students use appsin all three categories regularly, but most of them only do it on a weekly basis,
and only less than a half do it on a daily basis. Third, students who use exclu-
sively social media apps on their mobile device are more likely to do it on a dailybasis than on a weekly basis; there are 3 times as many students doing the
Figure 6. Heavy users of social media, games, and educational apps with the intersection of

in all three categories regularly, students who play games on their mobile devices
are more likely to do it on a daily basis than on a weekly basis. This rate ofheavy use increases for students who play games but do not use educational
apps on their mobile device, especially for those who use their mobile device
exclusively for gaming (albeit only two and seven students were categorized asexclusively regular and heavy mobile gamers, respectively). This indicates that
games, just like social media apps, are more addictive than educational apps.
The difference is that games have a much smaller niche than social media apps,which are much more popular among common users.Table 9. Logistic Regression Estimates of Apps Use.

cant predictors of regular and heavy use in each category. Two new dummy
variables were constructed from the previous apps use variable to representthese two types of users for each apps category. The same independent variables
used in the previous logistic regression analysis are used in the models, in addi-
tion to two device bundles, each representing one end of the spectrum: thosewho own all four devices and those who have a smartphone as their only per-
sonal computing device. Table 9 shows the results of logistic regression models.
The age variable is omitted in the model due to multicollinearity with grade andeducation level.
The ﬁndings show that regular and heavy users of educational apps are more
likely to be older students (high school vs. middle school and higher grade vs.lower grade), students in urban Java, those with more positive attitudes toward
ICT, and those who own all-four-device bundle. On the contrary, students who
only own a smartphone are less likely to use educational apps regularly. Formobile games, male students are much more likely to play regularly than female
students, even more so when it comes to playing these games on a daily basis.
Students in the rural non-Java area, the owners of the all-four-device bundle,and younger students (middle school vs. high school and lower grade vs. higher
grade) are also more likely to play games on their mobile device regularly.
In terms of social media apps use, things are a little bit different than the
other two categories due to the fact the more than 96% of them are regular users
of social media already. As it turns out, only one predictor is signiﬁcant in the
model for regular use of social media apps. Those who own a smartphone astheir only mobile are the only group who are less likely to access social media on
their mobile device. For heavy use, however, more predictors turn out to be
signiﬁcant. Those with more positive attitudes toward ICT, high school stu-dents, and students in urban Java are more likely to access their social media
on a daily basis rather than on a weekly basis. The difference between signiﬁcant
predictors for the regular and the heavy use of social media is not that surprisingconsidering the distribution of the students who use social media on their mobile
device. It indicates that the difference between regular and heavy users of social
media is as signiﬁcant as the difference between nonregular and regular users,unlike in games and educational apps where the difference between regular
and heavy users is not as signiﬁcant as the difference between nonregular and
regular users.
Furthermore, purchasing price of mobile devices turns out not to be a sig-
niﬁcant predictor in any model, contrary to the education level and location that
are signiﬁcant predictors for all three apps categories. This ﬁnding suggeststhat geographical proximity is an inﬂuential factor to the network effect of
apps use, especially for educational apps and games. A more detailed look at
the data shows that the most played game among these students is Clash ofClans, a massive multiplayer online real-time strategy game. This type of game18 Journal of Educational Technology Systems 0(0)requires players to team up with other players to form a clan if they want to
increase the chance of winning the game. Also, unlike some other console-like
games that are usually graphically and computationally demanding, this gamecan run well on pretty much any mobile devices regardless of its price so long as
it has an acceptable Internet connection.
Time spent on mobile device. The next step is to investigate the relationship
between app use in all three categories with the total time spent on mobile
devices daily. The data for total time spent on mobile devices are self-reported as six-level categorical variable as shown in Table 4. Multiple corre-
spondence analysis (MCA) is used to analyze the multivariate relationship
between app use and time spent on mobile devices because of the followingreasons. First, MCA is speciﬁcally designed for analyzing nominal and categor-
ical data, as opposed to principal component analysis that is used for analyzing
continuous data. Second, it can be used to detect the underlying structures in thedataset without having to satisfy a certain assumption, unlike regression anal-
yses. And third, it will be more helpful to have a good visualization of the data
with point clouds representing individuals in a two-dimensional Euclidean spaceproduced by MCA. The MCA is done with R 3.4.3 in RStudio with the help of
FactoMineR (Leˆet al., 2008), factoextra (Kassambara & Mundt, 2017), ggplot2
(Wickham, 2016), and ggrepel (Slowikowski, 2017) libraries. All four variables
of interest are set as active categories, while the other relevant variables from the
survey such as demographic data are used as supplementary variables. Given
the characteristics of the data, several iterations of MCA are done with somechanges in the model, speciﬁcally in the categorization or data coding of all four
active categories. In terms of the observations included in the visualization, the
initial run has all students who own mobile devices included, but the resultingvisualization is not that helpful because of the outliers, identiﬁed as the nonuser
and ex-user of social media apps. There are two possible approaches to deal with
this matter. The ﬁrst is by removing the outliers, and the other approach is bycombining all the nonuser, ex-user, and sometimes also light user of social media
as one group instead of treating them as separate categories.
After 45 iterations of MCA, each with different model speciﬁcations, two
ﬁnal models were selected. The main difference between the two models is that
the ﬁrst model (A) uses Type 2A coding (i.e., light vs. regular users), while the
second model (B) uses Type 2B coding (i.e., casual vs. heavy users) for all threeapps categories as speciﬁed in Table 4. Regarding the daily time spent on mobile
devices, a simpler three-level category is used in both models. It is done by
combining all the intermediary groups (i.e., 1–2 hours, 2–3 hours, 3–4 hours,and 4–5 hours per day) into one (i.e., 1–5 hours) as they often overlap with
each other in the visualization of other models. Finally, in dealing with the
outliers, the second approach is used as it can explain slightly more variancesthan the ﬁrst approach while having no signiﬁcant difference in the resultsPratama and Scarlatos 19between the two of them. This approach also means the same number of obser-
vations is used in all analyses throughout this chapter.
The ﬁrst MCA visualization approach used is the biplot of active categories
for each model. As shown in Figures 7 and 8, the ﬁrst two principal dimensions

Figure 9. MCA factor map of individuals with confidence ellipses around active categories
for Model A.MCA¼multiple correspondence analysis.Pratama and Scarlatos 21can explain 29.66% of the total variances for Model A and 28.39% of the total
variances for Model B, respectively. In both models, the ﬁrst principal dimen-
sion separates the nonuser from any types of users in all three categories, whilethe second principal dimension is highly correlated with the daily time spent on
mobile devices. Interestingly, from both biplots, it looks like those who spent
5 hours or more per day on their mobile device are most likely to be regulargamers and heavy users of educational apps. The biplots also suggest that the
ex-gamers are more likely to be former light gamers than former regular gamers.
This ﬁnding is supported by the next visualization of MCA factor map ofindividuals with conﬁdence ellipse around each category as shown in Figure 9
for Model A and Figure 10 for Model B, respectively. While the factor map
shows no overlap in the conﬁdence ellipses in any category, the distance betweenlight gamers and ex-gamers in Model A is minimal. These ﬁgures also show two
distinct populations between gamers, including those who no longer play games
presumably temporarily and nongamers.
While the ﬁrst two dimensions can only explain less than 30% of the varian-
ces, adding the next three principal dimensions can help explain up to 63.5%
of the total variances in Model A and up to 59.4% of the total variances inModel B. As shown in the chart, heavy users of educational apps are closely
related to those who spent 5 hours or more per day only in the biplots form the
ﬁrst two principal dimensions and not from the others. The opposite is true forregular and heavy gamers who are closely related to those who spent 5 hours or
more per day in all but one biplot from the ﬁrst ﬁve principal dimensions.
It further indicates that heavy users of educational apps are the ones whospent 5 hours per day on their mobile device only for around 30% of these
students but not for the other 70%. Overall, games and social media apps have a
stronger and more consistent inﬂuence in making these students spend moretime on their mobile device.
The last analysis in this article is to estimate the time spent on mobile devices
to see if there are any signiﬁcant predictors of spending more hours on mobiledevices. Because it is less reliable to treat the self-reported data of daily time
spent on mobile devices as a continuous variable and because almost half of the
students spent 5 hours or more per day, logistic regression method is once againused to analyze the data. One new dummy variable is constructed to differen-
tiate between those who spent 5 hours or more on mobile devices and those who
spent less than 5 hours per day. The same independent variables used in theprevious logistic regression analysis to estimate the frequency of apps use are
also used in the logistic regression model. Table 10 shows the results of the
logistic regression model. Just like in the previous logistic regression models,age variable is, once again, omitted in this model due to multicollinearity with
grade and education level.
The ﬁndings show that the owner of the all-four-device bundle is the stron-
gest predictor of spending 5 hours or more per day on mobile devices, followed22 Journal of Educational Technology Systems 0(0)by location, owner of the smartphone-only bundle, the price of the mobile
device, education level, sex, and attitudes toward ICT. The grade is the only
predictor that turned out to be not signiﬁcant. Students who own all-four-devicebundle are more than 4 times more likely to spend 5 hours per day on mobile
devices, while students in the rural non-Java area are more than twice more
likely to do likewise, contrary to the smartphone-only owners who are morethan twice less likely to do so. Students who own the most expensive mobile
devices are almost twice more likely to spend 5 hours or more on their mobile
device, while female students and high school students are about half as likely.Finally, each level increase in students’ attitudes toward ICT increases the like-
lihood of spending 5 hours per day on mobile devices by approximately a third.
This result is quite consistent with the ﬁnding from separate research with col-lege students instead of secondary school students in Indonesia where femaleTable 10. Logistic Regression Estimates of Daily Time Spent on Mobile Devices.

with more positive attitudes toward ICT adoption are more likely to spend moretimes on their mobile devices (Pratama, 2018).
This result is interesting because some predictors such as bundle ownership
and attitudes toward ICT have the same positive effect in daily time spent on
mobile devices as they do in apps use in any categories. For other predictors that
have an alternating effect on apps use in different categories, such as locationand education level, the effect on daily time spent on mobile devices is a com-
bination between the two. The effect of the location variable is like its effect on
games use, while education level variable shares a similar effect on daily time
spent and on educational apps use. The sex variable has the opposite effect
between apps use and daily time spent, while two other variables (i.e., priceand grade) are signiﬁcant predictors for one dependent variable but not for
the other.
From all these ﬁndings, it appears that regular use of apps does not neces-
sarily translate to more time spent on mobile devices for each of the different
groups of users. For example, male students are almost 3 times more likely to beregular gamers and almost 5 times more likely to be heavy gamers than female
students, but the odds of them spending 5 hours or more per day on mobile
devices is almost twice less likely than those of female students. The data also
indicate that a combination of regular use in certain apps category and certain
predictors has a positive effect on daily time spent on mobile devices. This is truefor regular gamers in rural area and high school students who use educational
apps regularly.
Conclusion
This study yielded several signiﬁcant ﬁndings regarding current ownership and
use of mobile devices in secondary schools. While this study focuses onIndonesia, it also has implications for education in other countries. This is
especially true in the Southeast Asia region, in which Indonesia is the largest
and the most populous country and where most other countries in this regionare also developing countries that share some cultural similarities with
Indonesia. It is also true for other developing nations where the ICT infrastruc-
ture, especially for their wired broadband Internet connection, is still limited so
that their people must rely more on wireless networks.
Of four personal computing devices in this study, smartphones and laptops
are the most popular ones with more than 90% of the students already own
either one, far ahead of desktop and tablet that are owned by less than 50%each. While there is no signiﬁcant difference between males and females in terms
of laptop and smartphone ownership, desktops are strongly associated with
males, whereas tablets are strongly associated with females. This is also truefor device bundle ownership. While more than 80% already own both a laptop24 Journal of Educational Technology Systems 0(0)and a smartphone altogether, males are more likely to add a desktop to their
bundle, whereas females are more likely to add a tablet instead. This ﬁnding,
which is consistent with the ﬁnding from separate research with college studentsinstead of secondary school students in Indonesia (Pratama, 2018), might indi-
cate different use cases leading to a strong preference on desktop over tablet for
males and vice versa. For example, desktop gives a better gaming experience,and most gamers are males.
These ﬁndings also conﬁrm the status of smartphone as the most universal
device to own. Students who own no smartphone are most likely due to their lessfavorable attitudes toward ICT instead of any other reasons such as ﬁnancial,
sex, or age. On the other hand, tablet ownership is strongly associated with high
SES. Smartphones are usually the ﬁrst device owned, followed by a laptop.More than 80% of the students already own these two devices in their
bundle. For students who have a third device, desktops are preferred by
males, students with middle-to-low SES, and students from urban Java; tabletsare preferred by females, students with high SES, and students in rural non-Java
instead. More than 20% of the students own all four devices. They tend to be
early adopters, younger students, students in a higher grade, students with highSES, or students in urban Java.
The effect of the digital divide between different geographical regions is clear-
ly shown in the ownership of personal computers. Students in urban Java aremuch more likely to own a desktop, a laptop, or any bundle with both desktop
and laptop than students in rural non-Java. Differences in price and supporting
infrastructure, where students in urban Java have an edge on them over studentsin rural non-Java, might be the main reasons behind it.
Personal computers are also more favorable toward older students than they
are toward younger students. High school students and students in a highergrade are more likely to own either a desktop or a laptop than middle school
students and students in a lower grade, respectively. As students go further in
their education, they tend to have more to do and need more help from theirdevices. This ﬁnding might be an indication that these students still deem per-
sonal computers as more serious devices to do their productivity activities from
than mobile devices. However, age does not necessarily go hand in hand withgrade and education level when it comes to its effect on device ownership.
Although older students in general are more likely to own some devices or
device bundles, younger students in the same grade and education level aremore likely to own the same device than their older classmates. It might be
an indication that some external factors such as parents’ age, parents’ education,
or student’s birth order are at play. Unfortunately, the data collected in thisstudy are not enough to give a better explanation about this ﬁnding.
Regarding mobile app use, 98% are regular users, and most use it on a daily
basis. Educational apps are regularly used by around 85% of the students with73% of them use these apps on a daily basis. Games are used regularly by merelyPratama and Scarlatos 2542% of the students, and only 63% of them play the games on a daily basis.
Of these three apps categories, games have the highest number of ex-users of all
at around 30%, and these ex-users are most likely to be the former light gamers
who play on a monthly basis at most. The data also show that more than 40%
of the students spend 5 hours or more per day on their mobile device. While
almost all of these students are regular or even heavy users of social media, theMCA biplots show that they are also strongly associated with regular and heavy
use of games and educational apps. A stronger and more consistent effect is
found in the regular use of games and social media.
Some limitations in this article could be addressed in the future work by
expanding the sample to include students from different countries and regions
so that the results can be more generalizable to a broader scope. Also, using the
actual income of the student’s family, while might not always be available like it
was in this study, would make for a better measurement for SES than
self-reported purchase price of mobile device used in this article. Finally,
some interesting ﬁndings in this study could be explained better with the inclu-
sion of some other variables about family background such as parental educa-
tion, parents’ age, or student’s birth order.
