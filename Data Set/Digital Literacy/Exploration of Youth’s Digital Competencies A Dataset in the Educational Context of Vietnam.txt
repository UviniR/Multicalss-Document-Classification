Abstract: The recent surge of the Fourth Industrial Revolution has set forth demands for a new
generation of the labor force with a comprehensive set of skills to meet the standards of the global
market. Despite widespread concerns about educational reforms and renovations to enhance the
workforce capacity in terms of information and communication technology (ICT) skills, research
into the digital proﬁciencies of students has been limited in Vietnam. This dataset contains 1061
observations on the digital competency level of 10th-grade students in 20 surveyed schools from ﬁve
provinces in Vietnam. The investigation, joining frequentist and Bayesian analyses, aims to provide
valuable insights into the current state of children’s attitudes, behaviors, competency levels, and
use of ICT within the Vietnamese educational context. The values of the dataset lie in its proposed
scientiﬁc framework for replication in multiple regions and contexts as well as the feasibility of
categorical regression techniques together with Bayesian statistics for hierarchical regression analysis.
Dataset: The dataset is submitted and will be published as a supplement to this paper.

1. Summary
This manuscript introduces a dataset (Supplementary Materials) of 1061 observations of students
from 20 senior high schools across ﬁve provinces and cities in Vietnam. The dataset was collected
Data 2019 ,4, 69; doi:10.3390 /data4020069 www.mdpi.com /journal /dataData 2019 ,4, 69 2 of 37
as a component of the “Digital Kids Asia Paciﬁc (DKAP)” project that aimed to investigate school
students’ information and communication technology (ICT) competency levels in Asia-Paciﬁc through
four pilot countries: Vietnam, Bangladesh, Fiji, and the Republic of Korea. The DKAP investigation,
implemented by the United Nations Educational, Scientiﬁc, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in
Bangkok within the scope of the “Fostering Digital Citizenship through Safe and Responsible Use of
ICT” Project, seeks to establish concrete understanding of ICT use and competency levels of regional
children by creating and verifying a framework to gather quantitative data reﬂecting their attitudes,
perceptions, proﬁciency, and behavioral use of ICT in an educational setting. The compiled data
include information regarding respondents’ demographic and personal features such as gender, ICT
awareness and access, socioeconomic status, school and neighborhood living standards, and their
digital citizenship competencies.
The goal of this dataset is not only to describe students’ ICT cognitive and non-cognitive skills,
but also to encompass a thorough examination of the relationship between demographic, cognitive,
behavioral, sociocultural, and contextual factors, and the digital competencies of school students.
Utilizing both the frequentist and Bayesian approaches, analyses of these data would shed light on
possible predictive factors and the determinants of ICT proﬁciency as an essential ability of future
global citizens.
This research is particularly crucial to developing economies that rely heavily on technology
transfer to boost technological progress and sustain long-term economic growth [ 1] Research has
conﬁrmed the underlying signiﬁcance of human capital stock in secondary and tertiary levels of
education, as absorption capacity, in facilitating technology transfer [ 1,2]. The ICT skills readiness
of school students is even more critical for low and middle-income economies in the era of Industry
4.0, which presents substantial challenges and opportunities. In Vietnam as a particular case study,
researchers have pointed out the increased risks for the “middle-income trap” where investment will
recede due to the rising labor cost and poor labor-saving technology [ 3]. As Vietnam transits from
traditional entrepreneurship to a new ‘computational entrepreneurship [ 4,5], skill shortages are another
problem facing the Southeast Asian country, with the highest percentage of wage workers at risk due
to automation in the region [ 6]. As of 2016, low skilled workers still took up to over one-third of the
total labor force in the country [ 7], despite a growing demand for information technology (IT) workers
by 47% per year [ 8]. Alongside the possible disruption in growth rates and concerns over the weak
human capital, Vietnam’s cybersecurity is still vulnerable, with a four-fold increase of the number of
cyberattacks and incidents within one year from 2015 to 2016 [ 9]. Vietnam only ranked 101 out of 193
countries in a global cybersecurity index in 2017 [ 10]. Recognizing this peril of falling far behind in
the age of digitalization, the Vietnamese government has made an e ort to improve skills education
for youth, especially technical education [ 11]. In addition to enhancing the competitiveness of the
labor force, digital competencies are also relevant to widespread concerns facing the global community
such as cyberbullying, youth suicide, depression, or behavioral disorders [ 12]. Therefore, ﬁndings
from this dataset are expected to have signiﬁcant implications for the development and evaluation of
management and capacity-building policies in the emerging country.
Within the scope of this text, description of the dataset, including the survey questionnaire,
potential research questions, the research framework, and our data collection procedure will be
presented. Examples of possible statistical model methods and analyses will also be provided.
Limitations and potential implications of the dataset will be discussed in the ﬁnal section of the paper.
2. Data Description
DKAP was proposed as part of UNESCO’s “Enhancing National Capacity to Foster Digital
Citizenship Education in Asia Paciﬁc” project to understand students’ digital competency in the Asia
Paciﬁc region. The project was ﬁnancially supported by the Government of the Republic of Korea
Funds-In-Trust and Google in close cooperation with The International Telecommunication Union
(ITU) and The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).Data 2019 ,4, 69 3 of 37
The DKAP survey tool has been assessed as reliable and validated to measure digital citizenship
competencies under the DKAP Framework. A total of 5129 responses from children aged 15 from four
countries—Bangladesh, Fiji, South Korea, and Vietnam—have been obtained using the instrument
within the scope of a comparative investigation study of digital citizenship across the pilot countries.
The Vietnam Institute of Educational Sciences (VNIES) became the focal point of the Ministry of
Education and Training to carry out the project component in Vietnam. VNIES signed the contract with
UNESCO Hanoi (N04500363176) to conduct the survey in September 2018 in ﬁve provinces within the
country. The survey questionnaire of the project in Vietnam was translated into Vietnamese from the
English version of the DKAP framework.
The dataset contains responses by 1061 15-year-old school students regarding their digital
competencies. The questionnaire consists of 117 multiple-choice questions, most of which require the
respondents to choose one single answer out of the provided options, while some of the questions
ask for more than one answer. Questions and answers were treated as discrete and continuous
variables and encoded according to the coding instructions provided by UNESCO (see the dataset).
The questions were divided into two groups: group (1), contextual questions; and group (2), digital
competence questions. Group 1 contains 33 items asking for students’ ICT experiences along with
their demographic information. Group 2 contains 84 items concerning students’ ICT competencies
across ﬁve di erent domains.
2.1. Group (1) Personal Background Questions
The 33 question items in group (1) cover three domains: (1) student personal background
(eight items); (2) access and usage of digital devices (18 items); and (3) socioeconomic status (SES)
(seven items).
2.1.1. Domain (1): Student Personal Background
In domain (1), the ﬁrst two questions are ‘Gender’ and ‘Year of birth’. The question of ‘Gender’
oers two options: ‘female’ and ‘male’ (‘F1’). Other questions within this domain ask about
the surveyors’ current study grade level (‘F3’), the language they use (‘F4’), their country (‘F5’),
expected highest level of education(‘F6’), number of days absent from school (‘F7’), and time spent on
outside-school activities (‘F8’).
The distribution of answers for domain (1) questions is presented in Table 1. The percentage of
female participants is slightly higher than male participants (by 6.2%). Nearly all (99%) of the students
were born in 2003, and all were in Grade 10. In the Vietnamese 12-grade education system, these
students were in the ﬁrst year of senior high school.
The question of academic expectation asks about the highest expected education level. The
responses were encoded as variable ‘F6’. Statistics show that the majority of students wished to
complete post-secondary (36%) and masters /doctoral level (33.5%). Distributions of responses to F6 by
gender can be found in Figure 1.Data 2019 ,4, 69 4 of 37

2.1.2. Domain (2): Access and Usage of Digital Devices 
Regarding students’ access and usage of digital devices, the first question in domain (2) on 
students’ “experience of using digital devices” yields  four values: ‘never’, ‘l ess than 1 year’, ‘1–2 
years’, ‘3–4 years’, and ‘more than 5 years’ (‘G1’). The other questions in this domain collect information about the frequency of students’ Internet access from a digital device (‘G2’); the location from which they are connected to the Internet (‘G3 ’), the types of digital devices used for Internet 
connection from home (‘G4’), school  (‘G5’), or a local community access point (‘G6’); the type of

The responses to questions on the purposes of computer and Internet usage were encoded as
continuous variables ‘G13’, ‘G14’, ‘G15’, and ‘G16’. Statistics indicate that the modal value for ‘G13’ is
1–2 h of computer and Internet usage per day for school study purposes.
Figure 2 depicts the distribution of values for variable ‘G14’ about the amount of time spent online
or using computer by gender. The horizontal axis refers to the provided di erent time lengths. The
blue columns represent the number of female students, and the red columns represent the number of
male students. It can be seen that a large number of students spent between one and two hours online
for personal study purposes (55%). It also seems that female students preferred spending more hours
online or using a computer than their male counterparts.Data 2019 ,4, 69 10 of 37

Regarding the level of help and support from others, less than a quarter of parents /caregivers
were perceived as being highly concerned for their children’s cyber safety (‘H6_1’). The level of
encouragement from parents, teachers, peers, and siblings for the students’ online learning activities
also seem to be low (‘H7’).
2.2. Group (2) Competency Questions
The purpose of group (2) questions is to learn about competency level in using digital technology
and the capacity to manage potential risks caused by digital technology. This group comprises ﬁve
domains and corresponding component capacities: Digital Literacy, Digital Safety and Resilience,
Digital Participation and Agency, Digital Emotional Intelligence, and Creativity and Innovation (see
the dataset).
The Digital Literacy domain consists of 14 questions assessing the use of tools and digital
information: for example, the ability to use software and digital devices and exploit digital information
in dierent contexts. Assessing scale is in the form of a four-point Likert scale measuring the extent
to which students can exploit tools and digital information. The visual distribution of responses for
this variable is displayed in Figure 3a. The modal option is ‘agree a little’ to the ability to use digital
tools and information, followed by an almost 30% proportion of the respondents claiming to ‘agree a
lot’, meaning highly conﬁdent in their ability to handle digital tools and information. Besides, theData 2019 ,4, 69 14 of 37
distribution of gender in each choice is relatively homologous. The mean scores by gender in the
Digital Literacy domain is around 3.1 (Figure 3b).

also seem to be low (‘H7’). 
2.2. Group (2) Competency Questions 
The purpose of group (2) questions is to learn about competency level in using digital technology 
and the capacity to manage potential risks caused by digital technology. This group comprises five 
domains and corresponding component capacities: Di gital Literacy, Digital Safety and Resilience, 
Digital Participation and Agency, Digital Emotional Intelligence, and Creativity and Innovation (see the dataset).  
The Digital Literacy domain consists of 14 questions assessing the use of tools and digital 
information: for example, the ab ility to use software and digital devices and exploit digital 
information in different contexts. Assessing scale is in the form of a four-point Likert scale measuring 
the extent to which students can exploit tools and digital information. The visual distribution of 
responses for this variable is displayed in Figure 3a. The modal option is ‘agree a little’ to the ability to use digital tools and information, followed by  an almost 30% proportion of the respondents 
claiming to ‘agree a lot’, meaning highly confident in their ability to handle digital tools and information. Besides, the distribution of gender in each choice is relatively homologous. The mean scores by gender in the Digital Literacy domain is around 3.1 (Figure 3b).

Similarly, the other four domains (Digital Safety and Resilience, Digital Participation and 
Agency, Digital Emotional Intelligence, and Creati vity and Innovation) also  employ a four-point 
Likert scale to evaluate the corresponding capaci ties. Figure 4 illustrates the distributions of 
responses in each of the domains. 
The Digital Safety and Resilience domain includes 18 questions examining students’ 
understanding about digital rights, privacy protecti on, well-being, and risk management ability in 
the digital world. Figure 4a is the histogram of me an scores, which suggests that most of the students 
felt that they understood their rights, and knew ho w to protect their privacy and react to potential 
risk in the digital world. Figure 4b shows a small discrepancy in re sponses between girls and boys in 
this domain.

The distribution of students’ answers to questions in the Digital Emotional Intelligence domain is
displayed in Figure 6a. This domain consists of 16 questions aiming to assess students’ interpersonal
skills and awareness when joining the digital world (i.e., their use of social networking sites and
real-time chatting apps). The histogram of mean scores demonstrates that most of the answers fall into
the range of “agree a little” to “agree a lot”, meaning that the students showed ﬁrm understanding and
awareness of legitimate cyber behaviors. The mean score in this domain is not high (around three),
with a narrow gap between answers by boys and girls (Figure 6b).Data 2019 ,4, 69 16 of 37

2.3. Potential Research Questions
Use of the Internet or digital devices at home is a vital factor inﬂuencing primary students’ ICT
literacy [ 13]. Speciﬁcally, a study in German primary schools suggested a lack of parental concern for
the online behaviors of their children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds [ 14]. Moreover, it is not
easy to obtain the goal of digital equity among students from di erent backgrounds [ 15]. In general, a
higher level of self-e ciency is associated with a better level of self-perceived digital competencies [ 16].
Regarding gender, there are di erences in the basic digital competencies of male and female university
students [17]. Drawing on the dataset, we present potential research questions in the following list.
 What are the background factors that could a ect students’ digital competency levels?
 How do socioeconomic conditions a ect students’ digital competency levels?
 What are the factors related to the access and usage of digital devices that could a ect the digital
competencies of students in any domains?
 Is there any relationship between high academic expectation and students’ digital
competency levels?
 Is there any correlation among the ﬁve domains of digital competencies?
 Are there any di erences in the digital competency levels of male and female school students?Data 2019 ,4, 69 18 of 37

3. Methods
3.1. Research Framework
This research is theoretically based on Bronfenbrenner’s bio-ecological model, which describes
a child’s maturity in interactions with multiple levels of sociodemographic, cultural, and societal
elements that constitute his or her community [ 18]. In particular, the model proposes four layers of the
environment with a respective impact on a child’s cognitive growth.
As illustrated in Figure 8, the innermost circle represents a microsystem that contains the developing
individual together with their personal and closest ties. The next layer is a mesosystem involving the
interdependence of the microsystems with which the developing individual actively interacts (e.g.,
the child’s interrelationship between home and school environments). This is accommodated in an
ecosystem with contexts having indirect and distant e ects on the developing child. The outermost
layer macrosystem encompasses systematic cross-cultural compatibilities together with philosophies or
ideologies that reinforce the structure.

Figure 8. Research framework of the study. 
Given the scarcity and underdevelopment of  theoretical explanations for children’s 
development of digital competencies, Bronfenbrenn er’s bio-ecological model serves as a useful 
framework by offering a child-centered approach to  examine children’s behaviors, knowledge, or 
attitudes relating to ICT, considering multiple layers of social impacts, and illustrated in the form of concentric circles of family, schools, or community and culture. 
The framework employed in this study pr oposes three sets of interconnections: 
o Personal level within the microsystem; 
o Social mediation level, primaril y concerning home, school syst em, and peer networks within 
the mesosystem; and 
o National level where the country is the subject of analysis, and the macro levels of 
socioeconomic classification, systems of regula tion, and cultural values act as influential 
factors. 
The Conference on Digital Citizenship Education in Asia-Pacific and the subsequent experts’ 
meeting have proposed a detailed framework of digital citizenship domains, proficiencies, and 
performance indicators to comprise a wide paramete r of essential competencies for a digital citizen 
to adapt to, develop, and serve the digital community in the 21st century. An itemized description of the framework is provided in Table A1, Appendix A. Definitions of the five suggested domains are listed in Table 5 below.

rights standards for children.
3.2. Data Collection
The research team strictly followed UNESCO’s procedure for the survey: (1) Organizing the
consultancy workshop in July 2018 to review and develop the adapted version of the survey
questionnaire; (2) Conducting the pilot test for the survey questionnaire at two schools in Hanoi and
making necessary amendments in August 2018; (3) Contacting the target school administrators and
coordinators and carrying out administrative work for the investigation; (4) Implementing the survey
with the support of school coordinators in September 2018 at 20 schools across provinces in Vietnam;
(5) Cleaning and encoding the data from 18 September to 1 October 2018, according to the codebook
and coding instructions (see the dataset) provided by UNESCO Bangkok.
The sample geographical locations are indicated in the map in Figure 9. In total, the survey
covered 1061 high school students (See Table A2, Appendix A) from 20 schools located in ﬁve provinces
and cities: Lao Cai, Hanoi, Danang, Lam Dong, and Can Tho.
3.3. Data Analysis
Raw data gathered from the questionnaire were entered into a spreadsheet at data.csv (see the
dataset). Then, the data were processed and saved in CSV format for analyses using R statistical
software (v3.5.3). Both frequentist and Bayesian statistics approaches were employed in the data
analysis process.
3.3.1. Frequentist Analysis
Since the majority of variables in the dataset are categorical, most of the responses and predictor
variables are discrete; thus, it’s appropriate to use logistic regression model for data analysis [ 19,20]. In
the logistic regression model, we use the two following equations:
lnj(x)
J(x)=j+T
jx,j=1,:::,J 1Data 2019 ,4, 69 22 of 37
In which xis the independent variable, and j(x)=P(Y=jx)is the corresponding probability.
Therefore,j=P

Besides, the data can be analyzed by a linear regression model for the numerical variables. The
general equation of the linear equation is:
Y=+1X1+kXk
where Yis a continuous variable; and the independent variables Xican be concrete, categorical,
or continuous.
The linear regression method is applied with the outcome variable being digital resilience (from
‘B15’ to ‘B18’), the father’s highest level of education (‘H2’), the student’s expectation of highestData 2019 ,4, 69 23 of 37
education level (‘F6’), and time spent using digital devices (‘G1’) as predictor variables. The regression
coecients are reported in Table 6.

3.3.2. Bayesian Analysis
The Bayesian statistics approach will also be used to examine the dataset in this section. A
hierarchical regression model of the amount of experience that students have with using digital devices
(‘G1’) according to their schools and sex was developed by employing R statistical software and
BayesVL package (v0.7.5), which is available in [ 21]. Similar applications of Bayesian statistics can
be found in [ 22,23]. The Bayesian approach is strong in visually demonstrating the results and the
distributions of the coe cients. Moreover, the robustness of the model is tested by analysis of the
sensitivity of the model to prior change. Its credibility is evident when the model does not show
sensitivity to adjustment of the prior [24–27].
The mathematical formula of the model is as follows:
G1[i] =alpha[i,j] +beta_sex * sex[i]
In which j =20 schools, and G1 is the student’s experiences in using digital devices: 1 =Never; 2
=Less than 1 year; 3 =1–2 years; 4 =3–4 years; and 5 =More than 5 years.
Examples of codes that were used to command the BayesVL package to construct the model are
as follows:
Box 1
# Design the model
model <- bayesvl()
model <- bvl_addNode(model, “G1”, “norm”)
model <- bvl_addNode(model, “sex”, “norm”)
model <- bvl_addNode(model, “schoolid”, “norm”)
model <- bvl_addArc(model, “schoolid”, “G1”, “varint”)
model <- bvl_addArc(model, “sex”, “G1”, “slope”)
# Generate the stan code for model
model_string <- bvl_model2Stan(model)
cat(model_string)
# Fit the model
ﬁt<- bvl_modelFit(model, dkap_data, warmup =2000, iter =20000, chains =4, cores =1)
Moreover, the STAN codes that were generated by the BayesVL package for the model sampling
and parameter learning are:Data 2019 ,4, 69 25 of 37

alpha_school ~ normal(mu_alpha, sigma_alpha);
//Likelihood part of Bayesian inference
//Outcome model N(mu, sigmaˆ2) (use SD rather than Var)

}

4. Conclusions and User Notes
Our dataset o ers comprehensive descriptive statistics yielding signiﬁcant insights regarding
digital citizenship competencies in the Vietnamese educational context, speciﬁcally school students’
perceptions, proﬁciency levels, and behavioral use of ICT. This research area has rarely been studied
in the ﬁeld of Social Sciences and Humanities, despite potential challenges concerning professional
development facing developing countries such as Vietnam in the age of Industry 4.0. With over 100
question items collecting information across the ﬁve domains—Digital Literacy, Digital Safety and
Resilience, Digital Emotional Intelligence, Creativity and Innovation, and Digital Participation and
Agency—the dataset contains values of multiple variables, both categorical and continuous, hence
allowing potential diverse methodologies of in-depth analyses and the strict control of variables.
The richness of our dataset would foster further research on multifaceted domains of digital
competencies in adolescents. Promising grounds for future investigations include the e ects of
school-related factors such as curriculum, teaching practices, syllabi or assessment criteria and format,
as well as non-educational factors concerning demographic backgrounds, daily time-spending routines,
or online behavioral activities. Research into these areas is critical, as ICT skills have been identiﬁed
as one of the major barriers to students and teachers’ readiness for STEM (Sciences, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics) education [ 28]. Scientiﬁc ﬁndings regarding the determinants of both
the cognitive and the non-cognitive attributes of the ICT competency of students would comprehensively
inform future decisions and suggestions for policy development, particularly in the education sector in
developing countries with similar socioeconomic structures to Vietnam [29].
In addition to presenting the dataset, this article also explores statistical methods for data analysis,
which is categorical data in this dataset. Traditionally, the frequentist approach is used for data
analysis. However, as the scientiﬁc community is debating over the traditional approach, due to
the manipulation of statistical signiﬁcance and other misconducts such as stargazing, p-hacking, or
HARKing [ 30], we also introduce the application of Bayesian statistics for hierarchical regression
analysis. The employment of both frequentist and Bayesian approaches are expected to strengthen
the credibility and soundness of scientiﬁc results produced from the dataset, which would pique the
interests of the scientiﬁc community and policymakers.Data 2019 ,4, 69 30 of 37
The values of this dataset are beyond the instant analyses of data, considering its high replicability
of methodology and the survey framework in di erent regions and contexts. As stated earlier in this
text, the study was originally designed to make a cross-national comparison of data in four countries:
Bangladesh, South Korea, Vietnam, and Fiji. The ﬁndings derived from this dataset would be more
generalizable if the target sample is extended to include more observations from students at di erent
levels of study rather than limited to only 10th graders. A more comprehensive sample, which is
entirely feasible in the future, would allow interesting cross-regional and cross-generational ﬁndings
on a panoramic scale.
Therefore, replicating the survey framework to yield comparable datasets would contribute to
a cross-boundary database with immense scientiﬁc implications. Knowledge sharing, open access
to data and information are also aligned with the current movements in the academic world that
resulted from better communication and connection concerning international collaboration in research,
transparency of data processing, and Open Science [ 31,32]. It is not unusual nowadays that studies
with groundbreaking ﬁndings are attained by large research groups from all over the world, such as
the picture of the black hole [ 33] or the large dataset of societies [ 34]. All these changes will ultimately
address the global sustainable development goals of United Nations. This is also the original aim of
this investigation by UNESCO, and the reason why the organization approved the dissemination and
access of this dataset.
