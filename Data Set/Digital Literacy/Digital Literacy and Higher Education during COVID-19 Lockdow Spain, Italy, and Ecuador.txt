Abstract: Digital literacy constitutes the basis for citizenship in order to be effective and efficient in
the 21st Century in professional and personal lives. The set of skills and competences integrating
digital literacy are expected to be guaranteed in higher education. During the lockdown globally
imposed for the COVID-19 pandemic, educational systems worldwide had to face many disruptive
changes. The aim of this research is to present a comparative study of three countries’ higher education
institutions (Spain, Italy, and Ecuador), analyzing how they have faced the global lockdown situation,
focusing on the development of digital literacy. The methodological approach followed in this study
was quantitative with an exploratory-correlational scope using a questionnaire designed ad hoc and
applied in a sample of 376 students. Results point the necessity of enhancing the main aspects such
as the teacher’s digital skills, sources for learning that may be adapted, communication between
universities and students, and teaching methodologies that should be appropriate to the current context.
Conclusions may suggest rethinking higher education learning and reinforcing main issues for this
transformation, mainly: communication, teaching, and digital competences. Otherwise, digital literacy
is not being guaranteed, which means higher education is not accomplishing one of its main objectives.
Keywords: digital literacy; COVID-19; generation Z; students; lockdown; higher education; communication
1. Introduction
The development of the “knowledge society” implies social transformation in which citizens need
new skills and competencies. On the one hand, technological availability has motivated world-class
universities to develop innovative programs and new ideas to accelerate and improve both teaching and
learning [ 1]. On the other, as Jonas-Dwyer and Pospisil [ 2] (p. 195) observe, even if “the technological
revolution has been a catalyst for change in universities”, “research has shown that introducing
new educational technologies alone does not improve teaching and learning outcomes” if they are
not accompanied by specific training. Therefore, in a context of development and expansion of an
increasingly digital society, training in competencies within the scope of digital literacy of higher
education students should be essential, nonetheless, it is often viewed as something that “is often taken
for granted” [ 3] (p. 95). In Poore’s words, today, more than ever, we have the opportunity and the
technologies to assist us in the human project of shaping, creating, authoring, and developing ourselves,
however “we will not be able to achieve a liberating, collective intelligence until we can achieve a
collective digital literacy” [4] (p. 34).

Aligning with P érez-Tornero’s holistic approach, understanding media literacy as a concept
embracing all the ﬁelds and all the competences related to media, digital literacy is understood as
the “acquisition of the technical competence for using information and communication technologies,
understood in a broad sense, in addition to the acquisition of the basic practical and intellectual
capacities for individuals to completely develop themselves in the Information Society” [ 5] (p. 29).
Digital literacy may be understood as an inter-related set of skills or competencies necessary for success
in the digital age [ 6], developed and evolved in di erent dimensions address in models acknowledge
by countries and governments [7].
Within the context of the COVID-19 crisis, this has become even more evident [ 8]. The World Health
Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a global public health emergency of international concern
on 30th January 2020 as well as a pandemic on 11th March 2020 [ 9]. As of 6th April 2020, UNESCO
reported that there have been 1,576,021,818 affected learners out of 91.3% total enrolled learners in 188
countries in all levels of learning. Exactly as in many other aspects of everyday life, COVID-19 had
a serious impact on students, instructors, and educational organizations around the globe [ 10]: the
pandemic caused schools, colleges, and universities across the globe to shut down their campuses [ 11]
and quickly move conventional education to distance and virtual learning [ 12]. Current educational
circumstances are so unique that some authors accurately propose to define this new situation “crisis
learning”. Due to this uniqueness and exceptionality of past and current circumstances, many studies
are emerging on the impact of COVID-19 restriction measures in different educational levels [ 10,13] and
different contexts [ 11,14,15]. Most of these studies focus either on specific countries [ 13] or on specific
aspects, such as technical aspects of e-learning [ 10] or psychological impact [ 14] or communicative
perspectives [16].
The only—by the time—global study, developed by Crawford and colleagues [ 12], analyzing
twenty countries educational responses, concludes that the educational sector needs to unite to
postulate a future where students can be supported digitally, without compromising academic quality
and standards of the curriculum. The aim of this research is to present a comparative study of three
countries’ higher education institutions (Autonomous University of Barcelona in Spain; University of
Torino in Italy; and Technical University of Machala in Ecuador) analyzing how they have faced the
global lockdown situation, focusing on the development of digital literacy.
2. Generation Z and the “Digital Native” Debate
Although there is no absolute consensus about the precise boundaries of Generation Z, most
literature [ 17–19] considers that it is composed of individuals born between the years 1996 and 2010.
Their most important characteristic is that they are the ﬁrst generation that has never known a world
without the Internet. Their lives are molded by the Internet, which has been converted in a natural part
of their lives. Prensky [ 20] deﬁnes this cohort as “digital natives”, implying that having been exposed
to these digital technologies has endowed this generation with speciﬁc and even unique characteristics
that make its members completely di erent from those growing up in previous generations.
Teräs, Myllyla, and Teräs [ 21] consider that, having grown up with highly sophisticated media,
they are “naturally” more Internet savvy than their forbearers, displaying “natural skills of digital native
learners” (p. 1). Veen and Vrakking [ 22], in the same line, propose to call this generation homo zappiens ,
considering that this cohort have developed all the metacognitive skills necessary for enquiry-based
learning, discovery-based learning, networked learning, experiential learning, collaborative learning,
active learning, self-organization and self-regulation, problem solving, by themselves. According to
this vision, Generation Z students currently attending school or university are, therefore, considered
experts in understanding technology, socially open through the use of technology, fast and impatient,
and interactive and resilient multi-taskers [ 23]. Some research suggests that Generation Zers’ brains are
structurally di erent to those of previous generations [ 18,24]: surrounded by complex visual imagery,
the part of their brain responsible for visual ability is more developed, making them more reactive to
“visual learning”, but with a shortened attention span.Publications 2020 ,8, 48 3 of 17
Accordingly, there is a growing agreement that there is “a gap between higher education and
21st century skills” [ 21] and that educational institutions should adapt their methodologies [ 24]. Both
the concept itself and the description of the so called “digital natives” have been criticized, lacking
any empirical evidence or substantive characteristics. Kirschner and De Bruyckere [ 16], for example,
harshly criticize this deﬁnition, comparing “digital natives” to Yeti-like creatures: a myth, someone
that everyone talks about but that nobody has ever seen.
A study carried out by Romero, Guitert, Sangr á, and Bullen [ 25], comparing students of di erent
ages, for example, found that older students ( >30 years and thus born before 1984) who exhibited the
characteristics attributed to digital natives more than their younger counterparts.
In their research, 58% of their students, older than 30 showed the characteristics of the so called
“digital natives” more than their younger counterparts.
In terms of learning environment, a study from the University of Barcelona [ 26] concludes that the
“digital native” label does not provide evidence of a better use of technology, rather that technology use
is mainly inﬂuenced by the teaching model. Consequently, in a research on ﬁrst-year undergraduate
students at Hong Kong University, Kennedy and Fox [ 20] found that while students appear to use
a large quantity and variety of technologies for “personal empowerment and entertainment”, they
do always appear digitally literate in using technology to support their learning. This is particularly
evident when it comes to student use of technology as consumers of content rather than creators of
content speciﬁcally for academic purposes” [27] (p. 76).
Adding to this, Shatto and Erwin [ 28] consider that Gen Z students’ ability to obtain information
from online sources seems impressive, but they lack the ability to critique the validity of the information
and, are likely to get frustrated if answers are not clear immediately. Thus, keeping the attention of the
student and developing higher order thinking skills are critical components of successful teaching.
In other words, many students entering university today have a high level of exposure to digital
technologies and media, but they do not seem prepared to cross the bridge between personal and
academic use of technology. Therefore, as academic know-how is gained through formal education,
so too must technological prowess be gained through structured learning experiences [ 28]. For this
reason, it is vital that higher education institutions promote explicit and intentionally reasoned digital
literacy strategies, that combine the optimization of the competencies that both students and teachers
possess as users, with the generation of new competencies [29].
3. Digital Literacy
As previously mentioned, there is a growing agreement that there is “a gap between higher education
and 21st century skills” [ 21] and that educational institutions should adapt their methodology [ 1],
promoting explicit and intentionally reasoned digital literacy strategies, that combine the optimization
of the competencies that both students and teachers possess as users, with the generation of new
competencies [29].
Accordingly, even though digital literacy “has been one of those key concepts whose relevancy and
weight as a key element for a digital citizenship have shifted from being recommended to essential” [ 7],
the concept itself of digital literacy is not standardized, its scope is broad and has been researched from
dierent ﬁelds. The most common approaches so far have been those of media studies, educational
studies, computer science, information science, and librarianship [5].
Due to this, the understanding of this competence can be diverse. On the one hand, the different
understanding of digital literacy responds to the interests and scope of each era of literacy [ 30]. Therefore,
emerging at the end of the twentieth century with the spread of ICT (Information and Communications
Technology), the term mainly referred to computer literacy, that is to say to technological skills, while
with the growing of the “knowledge society”, has highlighted that digital literacy should be understood
as an “inter-related set of skills or competencies necessary for success in the digital age” [ 6]. In particular,
the so-called critical approach has been growing, mainly with the spread of media literacy studies.Publications 2020 ,8, 48 4 of 17
This approach highlights critical thinking as one of the fundamental aspects. Aligning with
Pérez-Tornero’s holistic approach, understanding media literacy as a concept embracing all the ﬁelds
and all the competences related to media, we understand digital literacy as the “acquisition of the
technical competence for using information and communication technologies, understood in a broad
sense, in addition to the acquisition of the basic practical and intellectual capacities for individuals to
completely develop themselves in the Information Society” [5] (p. 30).
Within this framework it is important to recognize that, since there is no unifying deﬁnition of
digital literacy, many models and implementation are possible [ 7]. Accordingly, we will examine our
result within the respective reference framework.
Digital Literacy Development Models
The development of digital literacy in Europe is based in both Spain and Italy on the DigCompEdu
reference framework [31] in which six dimensions are established that teachers must promote for the
development of adequate digital literacy with a series of sub-dimensions as shown below:
1. Dimension 1. Professional engagement, integrating organizational communication, professional
collaboration, reﬂective practice and digital continuous professional development.
2. Dimension 2. Digital Sources resources, including the following subdimensions: selecting, creating
and modifying and managing, protecting and sharing
3. Dimension 3. Teaching and learning, teaching, guidance, collaborative learning, self-regulated
learning.
4. Dimension 4. Assessment within assessment strategies, analyzing evidence, and feedback and
planning.
5. Dimension 5. Empowering learners, embracing accessibility and inclusion, di erentiation and
personalization, and actively engaging learners.
6. Dimension 6. Facilitating learners’ digital competence which includes ﬁve subdimensions: information
and media literacy, communication, content creation, responsible use, and problem solving.
In the context of Ecuador, Digital Agenda 2017–2021 [ 32] establishes 5 dimensions for the promotion
of digital literacy:
1. Dimension 1. Hardware, which includes two subdimensions: connectivity and equipment.
2. Dimension 2. Digital learning, including the following subdimensions: curriculum; learning
methodologies, content and digital sources.
3. Dimension 3. Teachers development, long life learning, pre-service teachers’ education and
professionalization, developing digital competences.
4. Dimension 4. Communication and promotion focusing on visualization, engaging and empowering,
and web content.
5. Dimension 5. Innovation related with developing new skills and competences for teachers and
learners.
The establishment of reference frameworks for the development of digital literacy in both contexts
is very similar, as can be seen in their description, and they are the fruit of a collective awareness of the
need to develop a new literacy according to the context of society of the information. In addition, its
international recognition has implied an e ort in recent years, from organizations, institutions, and
governments so that this change was being put into practice. The objective of the work presented
here is to carry out a speciﬁc temporal approximation (during the quarantine time for COVID-19,
March–April 2020) with a study of the perception of university students to verify whether during this
period of global conﬁnement has sought the development of dimensions that guarantee the acquisition
of digital literacy. To ensure greater signiﬁcance of the results, the study was applied to three countries:
Spain, Italy, and Ecuador, with a high incidence of COVID-19.Publications 2020 ,8, 48 5 of 17
4. Materials and Methods
From the study of the reference frameworks for digital literacy in the three contexts studied (Spain,
Italy, and Ecuador), the study dimensions associated with the variables that would later be included in
the design of the questionnaire were designed, based on the DigCompEdu [ 31] and the Digital Agenda
2017–2020 [32]. Thus, the study dimensions were established as follows:
 Dimension 1 [D1]. Teacher’s professional engagement and collaboration: it is related to professional
engagement, the capability to integrate organizational communication, professional collaboration,
and e ective practice and development.
 Dimension 2 [D2]. Digital learning and sources: this dimension is meant to be a rethinking of
conventional sources of learning, complementing the development of other dimensions. It includes
the necessity for citizens to be aware of how to responsibly use, access, and manage digital content .
 Dimension 3 [D3]. Teaching and teachers guidance and skills: Learning strategies will deﬁnitely
develop an appropriate digital literacy by designing, planning, and implanting in the di erent
stages of learning digital tools and technologies.
 Dimension 4 [D4]. Supporting /empowering students: having in mind this is a dimension related
to the development of digital literacy, it will ensure not only access to digital learning resources
and activities but empowering learners and fostering their digital competences.
These dimensions conducted to the deﬁnition of several variables of study for the design of
the questionnaire. The methodological approach followed in this study was quantitative with an
exploratory-descriptive scope [ 33], using three independent socio demographical variables of study
(gender, age, and country) and 20 dependent variables distributed for the analysis of each dimension
as follows: [D1] Teacher’s professional engagement and collaboration with four variables; [D2] Digital
learning and sources including six variables; [D3] Teaching and teachers guidance and skills integrating
ﬁve di erent variables; and [D4] Supporting /empowering students with ﬁve variables.
The dimensions and variables deﬁned allow us to specify the purpose of the study, drawing
the following research questions: [RQ1] During lockdown do teachers from the university show
professional collaboration coordinating and addressing the situation? [RQ2] What kind of sources
have teachers used during the lockdown? [RQ3] Did teachers use new learning methodologies to
guarantee quality in teaching? [RQ4] What was the perception of students about their teacher’s digital
competences? [RQ5] Did students perceive negative aspects in the teaching lessons during lockdown?
[RQ6] Did students feel their education was damaged because of this situation? [RQ7] Did students
feel they had enough digital competence level to face the situation? In the ﬁndings of all research
questions, the analysis and results will o er or not di erences among countries.
Based on this research questions, the following objectives were addressed: (1) ﬁrst, describe the
situation in three countries studied, focusing on the four dimensions designed related to digital literacy,
and, (2) secondly, ﬁnd out if there were signiﬁcant di erences among the three groups studied.
In order to reach the second objective, the hypothesis established were as follows:
Null Hypothesis (H0): There were no di erences among countries in the research questions deﬁned
Alternative Hypothesis (HA): There were di erences among countries in the research questions deﬁned.
This descriptive research applied a comparative study between Spain, Italy, and Ecuador on the
speciﬁc dimensions: consumption of devices and content during the global health crisis of COVID-19,
during the months of March–May 2020. The methodological proposal was designed from an exploratory
perspective and applied the survey instrument, which reached 2956 responses from 376 university
students from Spain, Ecuador, and Italy. In total, the study collected 65,032 pieces of evidence from the
three countries.Publications 2020 ,8, 48 6 of 17
4.1. Sample
The invited sample, conceived as the set of elements of the population that are asked to participate
in the investigation [ 17] corresponds to undergraduate students of Communication, Journalism, and
Education. The study was composed of 376 students aged between 18 and 40 years old (M =21.94;
SD=3.28). As shown in Table 1, the description of the sample was: in Spain, the participation represents
42.3% of the sample (N =159), whose ages range from 18 to 29 years. The students from Italy were the
33.2% (N =125), whose ages average between 18 and 24 years. In the case of Ecuador, 24.5% (N =92),
aged between 18 and 40 years.

The research was based on intentional sampling in the selection of the three participating universities.
In this type of sampling, the subjects subjected to analysis and study are chosen by the researcher
to be part of the sample with a specific objective [ 17] as they are considered adequate or suitable for
the investigation. Three universities from different socio-geographical settings were selected, which
received a strong impact from COVID-19, generating significant numbers of affected and deceased in
their territorial environment. In this regard, the institutions that made up the study were: Autonomous
University of Barcelona (Spain) participating with students of the degree of Journalism; University of
Torino (Italy), with the participation of students of the degree of Education, and Technical University of
Machala (Ecuador) that participated in the study with students of the Communication degree.
4.2. Instrument and Procedure
The design of the instrument was carried out with the objective of describing the observed situation
and exploratory analysis of the research questions raised in order to analyze the established dimensions
and find if there were differences among the three groups studied (Spain, Italy, and Ecuador). In the first
phase, the instrument was submitted to the judgment of experts, six in total, academics from the study
area, two in each country, in order to establish clarity and relevance to the items. This first step discarded
a total of 5 items for being redundant or imprecise and allowed six of them to be reformulated. For the
analysis of the reliability of the instrument from the statistical point of view, Cronbach’s Alpha was
carried out for each dimension of the study, all values being above 0.70. The instrument was designed
with Google Forms tool and, prior to its completion, each participant’s permission was requested.
It is important to note that before the data gathering, researchers assured the ethical issues in each
university were addressed. None of the three universities involved required authorization from the
ethics committee due the nature of the study, only the express participant’s permission. The final
instrument consisted of independent variables that collected sociodemographic information and of
dependent variables, a total of thirty-one as can be read in Appendix A, Table A1. Dichotomous
type questions were chosen because of the nature of information the researchers intended to gather.
The dichotomous question format is used when the issue under consideration most likely is thought
of in two possible values [ 18]. Statistical analysis of data was made with package SPSS, version 22,
descriptive and inferential analysis was addressed. In order to check the equality of variances Levene’s
test was applied, which is proper for two or more groups, obtaining a p-value below 0.05 ( p<0.05).
Results confirm there was no normality in the distribution of variables so non parametrical statistics
were required in our study. The study was conducted in two steps in order to reach objectives designed
in the four dimensions: firstly, with basic statistics (frequencies and chi-square test), and secondly,Publications 2020 ,8, 48 7 of 17
to determine the strengths of associations after chi-square, we observed Cramer’s V, (the suitable
measurement in nominal variables) in order to reject or accept null hypothesis, showing which groups
are different or where the groups differ. Accordingly, Norris et al. [ 33] and the interpretation for effect
size (ES) in Social Science in Cramer’s Vshould be considered as follows: ES 0.2 weak; 0.2 <ES0.6
moderate and ES >0.6 strong.
5. Results
In order to establish a clear explanation of results, they are presented as the following in the
dimensions designed, responding in each case to the research questions involved.
5.1. Dimension 1. Teacher’s Professional Engagement and Collaboration
Results for the ﬁrst dimension [D1] were addressed in two steps as previously explained. Firstly,
basic statics such as frequencies and chi-square for signiﬁcance where analyzed in order to extract
dierences among countries, as can be seen in Table 2. In this regard, students where asked in four
dichotomous nominal variables.

p<0.005.
In this dimension, the results answer to RQ1: During lockdown, do teachers from the university
show professional collaboration coordinating and addressing the situation? Descriptive statistics for the
ﬁrst dimension show signiﬁcant di erences among countries, for D1.1. Have teachers been well coordinated
among them during the lockdown? So, null hypothesis is rejected. Results show statistically signiﬁcant
dierences among all countries studied conﬁrmed by Cramer’s V: Spain–Italy (S-I) ( 2(1)=12.51 ,
p<0.005), Cramer’s V =0.210 which is weak but statistically signiﬁcant (ES 0.2); Italy–Ecuador
(I-E) ( 2(1)=56.22 ,p<0.005), Cramer’s V =0.509 moderate (0.2 <ES0.6); and Spain–Ecuador
(2(1)=14.25 ,p<0.005), Cramer’s V =0.679 strong (ES >0.6). D1.2., Have you felt you were not supported
enough? This item only shows statistically signiﬁcant di erences between Spain–Italy ( 2(2)=29.25,
p<0.005 ), Cramer’s V =0.321 moderate (0.2 <ES0.6). D1.3., Have you felt you were properly informed
about your lessons and proceedings? There were no signiﬁcant di erences among countries ( p>0.005),
which means that in this item, null hypothesis is accepted. About last item D1.4., Have you received
contradictory information anytime? Countries that di ered most were Italy–Ecuador ( 2(1)=23.25,
p<0.005 ), Cramer’s V =0.327 and Spain–Ecuador ( 2(1)=14.25, p<0.005 ), Cramer’s V=0.238 which
is moderate in both cases (0.2 <ES0.6).
Focusing on percentages, as seen in Table 2, bigger differences arise in the first and second items.
While Spanish and Italian students consider teachers were not well coordinated among them during the
lockdown, 86.16 and 68.8 percent respectively, in Ecuador students, a percentage of 82.6 consider the
opposite about their teachers. About item D1.2., Have you felt you were not supported enough? The highest
level is for Spain, 80.5 percentage of students have felt that during the lockdown they were not supported
enough from their teachers.
Dierences are evident once more when asking students about their perception about the learning
situation. The Spanish ones declare in a high average that this learning context assumes them a higher
workload, obligating them to be more autonomous and losing contact with classmates. Among ItalianPublications 2020 ,8, 48 8 of 17
students, these issues seem to be less relevant as conﬁrmed in Figure 1, and Ecuadorian are like Spanish
in this regard.

5.2. Dimension 2. Digital learning and sources 
Regarding the second dimension, it is worth noti ng that students were asked ten items to check 
issues related to digital learning and sources during this period in which learning was mediated trough Internet. From D2.1 to D2.3. items (see Tabl e 3), they were asked about what kind of sources 
did teachers use during the lockdown, and from D2.4 . to D2.6. (see Table 3), what sources did they 
prefer for their lessons. As seen in Table 2, some items present differences statistically significant ( p 
< 0.005) among countries, which means we could reject  null hypothesis, it is worth noting that in the 
item D2.5., videos and audiovisuals  as the preferred sources for learning from all students in all 
countries studied who seem to prefer videos an d audiovisual sources for learning (>0.95%).

These results give answer to [RQ2] about the kind of sources teachers have used during the
lockdown. The situation in Spain shows that for 91.19 percent of students, teachers have used texts and
that 95.59 percent of them will prefer video sources and audiovisual materials. Spanish students show
signiﬁcant di erences from Italian (S-I in Table 3) ( 2(1)=66.94, p<0.005), Cramer’s V=0.486 results
are statistically signiﬁcant between both countries and are also moderately di erent ( 0.2<ES0.6).
Spanish students from Ecuadorian (S-E in Table 3) ( 2(1)=14.98, p<0.005), Cramer’s V=0.244 show
lower di erences, which indicates to us that in both countries, papers and texts have been the most
used sources. In Italy, the situation seems to be more consistent than in Spain, where 94.4 percent of
students declare that teachers have used video sources and 96.8 percent conﬁrm that they prefer this
kind of materials for learning. Italian students show di erent perceptions from Spanish students inPublications 2020 ,8, 48 9 of 17
item D2.1 (as explained above), and from Ecuadorian students as well (I-E in Table 3) ( 2(1)=14.29,
p<0.005), Cramer’s V=0.257. A similar situation occurs in Ecuador with 84.78 percent declaring
teachers used videos and audiovisuals and 96.73 consider these as the best materials for lessons. As an
overview of these results, it is worth noting that 52.2 percent of all students in the sample declared that
materials used for lessons during lockdown were not appropriate. From these responses, 62.3 percent
of them argue that sources were not suitable for distance education, and 15.2 percent said that sources
were boring for distance education.
Responding to research question [RQ4] about if teachers used new learning methodologies
to guarantee quality in teaching, the 77.35, 94.4, and 55.43 percent from Spain, Italy, and Ecuador,
respectively declare that their teachers did not used any of these methodologies.
It should also be noted, as seen in Figure 2, that teachers using new learning methodologies in this
situation did not obtain all positive responses from students, 6.3 percent declare they were unusable
and 15.3 said they were not well designed. We find only 18 percent of students from those who respond
yes (22.34 percent from N =372), finding this innovation “engaging” and 56.8 percent “engaging
and useful”.

5.2. Dimension 4. Supporting–empowering students 
Empowering students and supporting them is the fourth dimension defined, it is essential for 
an appropriate digital literacy. This dimension ensures the accessibility to learning sources, and the 
use of technologies to foster learners´ active an d creative engagement. In a global situation of 
lockdown, to guarantee this dimension implies offering the opportunity for students to follow personalized learning pathways. The first data analyz ed in this regard do not indicate students have 
felt confident about the situation. From the whol e sample, results show that the 86.2 percent of 
students get the impression of their learning proc ess being damaged because of the situation and the 
way it has been solved. Data from countries reveal similar results, being Spain the country in which students felt more damaged: Spain, 93.08%; Italy, 79.2%; and Ecuador, 83.7%. 
Data collected in Table 5 give response to [RQ6 ]: Did students feel their education was damaged 
because of this situation? From the seven items st udied, two main variables were analyzed: D.4.1.

This situation has damaged your teaching (D4.1.1. to D4.1.4.) and D.4.2 Negative aspects in learning
(D4.2.1 to D4.2.3). Di erences among countries could be observed. In the ﬁrst item, it is worth noting
that 35.8% of Spanish students declared that the quality of teaching was the worst, and similar data for
Ecuadorian students was found that in a percentage of 85.8 said that the learning process was at a
lower level teaching. It also should be noted that half of Italian and Ecuadorian respondents (51.5 and
52.1, respectively) felt that learning was less stimulating, and all of them agreed that this situation lead
to an increase in homework in their daily learning process.

In order to reject or not the null hypothesis (H 0) in variable D.4.1. This situation has damaged your
teaching (D4.1.1. to D4.1.4), after chi-square signiﬁcant di erences for values p<0.005, Cramer’s V
values were observed. For Spain–Italy (S-I in Table 5) ( 2(3)=54.80, p<0.005) we reject null hypothesis,
value for Cramer’s V=0.461 indicates that results are statistically signiﬁcant and are moderately

Italy–Ecuador (I-E in Table 5), signiﬁcant di erences were also observed, 2(3)=40.16, p<0.005,
value for Cramer’s V=0.459, showing that results are statistically signiﬁcant and are also moderately

2(3)=79.70, p<0.005, value for Cramer’s V=0.564.
Regarding the variable D.4.2 Negative aspects in learning (D4.2.1 to D4.2.3), null hypothesis (H 0)
is also rejected. After chi-square showing signiﬁcant di erences, Cramer’s Vexplains the e ect size.
For Spain–Italy (S-I in Table 5) ( 2(4)=43.27, p<0.005), Cramer’s V=0.392 indicates that results are
statistically signiﬁcant and are moderately associated (0.2 <ES0.6). In relation to Italy–Ecuador
(I-E in Table 5) ( 2(4)=90.05, p<0.005) value for Cramer’s V=0.647 show strong association ( ES>0.6),
Italian and Ecuadorian students felt really di erent about this variable. Results in the case of Spanish

moderate di erences.
Keeping in mind students had not a very high feeling in the empowering dimension studied,
the following data give more context about the situation, responding to [RQ7] about the students’
perception about their own digital competence level to face the situation. It seems clear observing

As can be observed in Figure 5, three quarters of all countries felt confident (74.8 percent in 
Spain; 76 in Italy, and 73.9 in Ecuador). These data  are also supported by results in the last questions 
about fake news. To use technologies within a peda gogical purpose is essential for them to have the 
transversal skills needed for deep and critical thin king. In this regard, students in all countries 
declared receiving fake news during the lockdown bu t not almost sharing them as seen in Table 6.

6. Conclusions and Discussion
Since Glister defined digital literacy in 1997, the concept has been generally accepted and its
development is inherently merged to educational development [ 34–36]. In this regard, since the beginning
of this century, changes and challenges in the educational environment such as new competencies,
new digital media, open digital sources, digital communication, and critical thinking have been related
evolving all together in the multidimensional concept of digital literacy [ 7,37]. Already two decades since
not only the international community strives to develop this digital literacy through education [ 38,39],Publications 2020 ,8, 48 13 of 17
but also all countries and governments around the world [ 30–32], education should ensure digital
literacy whatever modality it acquires.
The aim of this research was to present a comparative-descriptive study analyzing how high
education in three di erent countries has faced the global lockdown situation in terms of ensuring the
development of digital literacy. Having in mind the unusual situation caused by COVID-19 seems to
be a disruption for education [ 39] that will obligate countries and governments to rethink educational
systems, it really makes sense to analyze what has happed during the lockdown situation in order to
face future decisions with empirical information [ 40]. In this regard, it could be said that one of the
limitations of this study is that it only analyzed three countries, future pathways could amplify the
research area in order to study the impact of this situation in a wider perspective.
In line with previous and recent research [ 29,41,42], this study presents an overview of the
development of digital literacy in three di erent contexts: Spain, Italy, and Ecuador. The novelty
in this case is that research is framed in the global lockdown caused by COVID-19, allowing us to
make interesting conclusions for the near future in which the pandemic situation still a ects education
and global health. Dimensions deﬁned and analyzed support ﬁndings and results in line with main
frameworks deﬁning digital literacy [ 30,31,39]. In this regard, we could highlight the following
conclusions from results obtained:
In first place, and regarding dimension one studied, Teacher’s professional engagement and collaboration ,
related to the capability to integrate organizational communication, professional collaboration, and
effective practice and development, results make us conclude that significant differences exist among
the three countries studied. For Spanish and Italian students, teachers have not been well coordinated in
this situation, they felt they were not properly informed and declare receiving contradictory information.
Nonetheless, all samples, Spanish, Italian, and Ecuadorian students, felt they were not supported
enough with statistically significant differences between Spain and Italy, and Spain and Ecuador.
Spanish students were the most disappointed in this regard. This evidence should be interpreted taking
into account, that in March 2020, the Italian government [ 43] announced it would equip schools with
digital platforms and tools for distance learning, lend digital devices to less well-off students, and train
school staff in methodologies and techniques for distance learning. Significant differences are shown as
well among countries in the case of receiving contradictory information, Spanish and Italian students
declared 24 points and 32 points above Ecuadorian students.
About dimension two, Digital learning and sources , analyzed, it can be concluded that digital
sources used during the lockdown by teachers, mainly texts and papers, were not the ones the students
would prefer as digital sources for learning, which were videos and audiovisual materials. Di erences
among countries are interesting in this point, showing that Spain was the county in which teachers
used papers and texts the most and videos and audiovisuals less. This may be one of the reasons for the
high level of displeasure among students from all countries on the way teachers and universities have
addressed the situation. These results are in line with the Organization for Economic Co-operation
and Development Report [ 39] (p. 10) highlighting several universities have “struggled and lacked the
experience and time they needed to conceive new ways to deliver instruction and assignments”.
The third dimension analyzed, Teaching and teacher’s guidance and skills, gives evidence that students
perceive positively the issue following their classes in a distance learning modality, however they perceive
too many negative aspects such as online lessons being too similar to face-to-face classes, not adapting
properly to the online philosophy. In the case of Spain, these results are reinforced in the fact students
felt teachers did not have appropriate skills to manage distance online teaching. Summarizing student’s
perceptions, the situation has given the worst quality of education, less stimulating and boring lessons,
and more homework to do. It is worth noting that no differences were found among countries in this
regard, so in future actions, this dimension should be reinforced and enhanced. Teachers’ digital skills
still continue being a key point in digital literacy development as previous research indicated [21,23].
All international frameworks and mostly nationals highlight dimension four as fundamental for a
proper digital literacy enhancement, Supporting-empowering students . Existing literature also emphasizesPublications 2020 ,8, 48 14 of 17
this area as essential [ 28,29]. This dimension gives them the engagement that ensures the accessibility
to learning sources, and the use of technologies to foster their active and creative engagement [ 44,45].
Results in this dimension have no signiﬁcant di erences among countries studied: Spanish students
felt the most that the quality of teaching was the worst, and Ecuadorian ones think the most learning
process has lower level during the lockdown. About too much work being demanded, Spanish and
Italian students were the most displeased groups. Students felt conﬁdent about their digital skills
and competences to face online distance learning. They all show a mature behavior receiving and
evaluating fake news; they mostly declared getting them but not sharing it at all.
The work presented is found in line with the last report by the OECD, The Future of Education and
Skills, The future we want [38] that constitutes part of the OECD Learning Framework 2030, but focusing
on new concerns related to the development of proper digital literacy during and after COVID-19.
These conclusions give interesting insights from students to face future challenges that the crisis has
brought to light: firstly, universities would need to rethink and reinvent learning environments, not only
based on a digital platform, striving to give learning possibilities through digitalization that expands
and complement students learning; secondly, digital skills and competences should be reinforced in
teachers as a key point in new learning scenarios, and it may be teachers are not ready enough for
digital learning opportunities, so efforts in technology investment are not enough to guarantee learning
for the near future.
