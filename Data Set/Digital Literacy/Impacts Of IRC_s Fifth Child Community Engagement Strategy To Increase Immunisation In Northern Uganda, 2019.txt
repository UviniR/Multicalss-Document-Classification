This study evaluated the International Rescue Committe's (IRC's) Fifth Child integrated community 
engagement strategy to improve immunisation coverage in Northern Uganda.
Context
Northern Uganda faces several challenges in meeting the health needs of its population. Maternal and child 
health services, including immunisation, remain weak and have stagnated, with only 73 per cent of children 
receiving the third and final dose of the diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccination (DPT3) (Uganda 
Demographic Health Survey, 2011). This rate has a range of causes, including limited community 
involvement and poor quality data to support decision-making. In early 2015, IRC established Fifth Child: a 
data-informed community engagement strategy to improve the stagnating immunisation coverage in 
northern Uganda.
Research questions
This study addresses the following questions:Does the intervention lead to an increase in DPT3 and 
Measles containing vaccine (MCV) combined immunisation coverage in 12 to 23-month-old children;Is there 
a reduction in vaccination drop-out rates for DPT 1, 2, 3 and oral polio vaccine 1, 2, 3;Will the intervention 
lead to improvements in the timely uptake of immunisations; andHas the intervention increased integrated 
community case management of children aged 6 - 59 months?
Methodology
Intervention design The intervention aimed to enhance community engagement through the use of better 
quality data for target defaulter-tracing using a mobile-health data collection platform called mReach. The 
mReach application aggregated and presented data on the immunisation status of children, which was used 
for tracking those who were due for (or had defaulted from) their scheduled immunisations. Using the 
application, the facility-based health workers downloaded lists of children due for immunisations as well as 
defaulters. These lists were shared with community health volunteers known as Village Health Teams for 
follow-ups during home visits. These data were also shared with community leaders, who were actively co-
managing immunisation outreaches with health workers. A second component of the intervention provided 
logistical support and supervision to health staff in both treatment and control areas for effective delivery of 
immunisation services.Theory of change The theory of change for this intervention hypothesised that data-
driven, targeted community engagement will facilitate more effective defaulter-tracing, contributing to 
increased immunisation coverage in underserved, vulnerable and hard-to-reach communities. The theory of 
change rested on the following assumptions: (1) the intervention would facilitate community co-
management of following up with immunisation defaulters and planning outreaches; (2) the mReach 
platform would improve data quality and provide health workers and community leaders with accurate and 
up-to-date data on immunisation defaulters; and (3) health workers and the Village Health Teams would be 
adequately trained to use the mReach data to conduct effective home visits that would prompt defaulting 
caregivers that are due for immunisation to complete the immunisation schedule of their children on 
time.Evaluation design A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted to evaluate whether the 
intervention increased coverage of DPT3 and MCV in children 12 to 23 months old. A cluster was defined 
as a health facility catchment area. Thirty-two of these were included; sixteen in the control arm and the 
remaining sixteen were intervention clusters. The sample comprised 55 children in the age group of 9-23 
months per cluster, which brought the total number of children included in this study to 1,760. Cross-
sectional household surveys were used at baseline and endline to measure the impact of the 
intervention.&nbsp;
Main findingsPlease read these findings in light of the limitations detailed below.The study found significant increases in 
DPT3 and MCV coverage rates in both intervention and control (from 68% to 77%) groups. In the 
intervention group, coverage increased from 65% to 76%, while in the control group coverage increased 
from 68% to 77%. However, the difference between intervention and control at endline was not 
significant.The mReach platform was designed to allow Village Health Teams to easily identify defaulters 
and perform targeted outreach. However, the results showed no difference between intervention and control 
groups in exposure to household visits or the actions taken by caregivers after such visits.The intervention 
appeared to have no effect on the timeliness of vaccinations, as there was no significant difference between 
treatment and control groups at endline for timely receipt of DPT3 and MCV.Use of the platform proved 
challenging for some healthcare workers, who did not initially find the application straightforward. Additional 
training and supervision from IRC staff and an mHealth specialist were required to ensure proper use of the 
application.Caregivers had positive views towards the involvement of community leaders in supporting 
immunisation, particularly the community leaders' ability to disseminate information to community members 
and to influence behaviour.All health workers in both treatment and control sites received immunisation 
update training from IRC and district leaders, which may have increased attention to immunisation services 
and improved coverage at study sites. Vaccine stock-outs were found to be common across all study 
sites.Limitations of the study The study has several major limitations, largely stemming from contamination 
between intervention and control groups. Some control sites implemented defaulter tracing systems that 
were similar to that provided by the mReach platform in intervention sites (albeit paper-based). In addition, 
some health workers were transferred from intervention to control sites during the course of the intervention. 
Thus, there is limited basis for drawing inferences about the causal impact of the intervention. Also, different 
measures of immunisation coverage showed different results: reported coverage based on administrative 
records (i.e., immunisation cards) showed marked improvement while coverage based on caregiver self-
report showed no increase. Thus, it is possible that the overall increase in recorded coverage resulted only 
from improvements in administrative tracking.&nbsp;
