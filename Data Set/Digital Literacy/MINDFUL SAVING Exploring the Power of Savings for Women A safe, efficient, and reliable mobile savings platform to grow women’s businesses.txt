Exploring the Power of Savings for Women
A safe, efficient, and reliable mobile savings platform to grow women’s businesses MINDFUL SAVING
Rose Kibona, a 59-year-old woman entrepreneur in Mbeya, Tanzania, has a stall in 
an open market where she sells soft drinks and prepared meals. She recently took a 
business training course administered by TechnoServe that included instruction on 
accessing M-Pawa, a new Vodafone mobile savings platform. She had been saving 
informally for years, relying on insecure containers like jars and bags. She planned 
to buy a car with the money saved in a large bag, and had a lockbox to save for 
emergencies. She exemplified the mindful saving behavior of many women micro and 
small entrepreneurs in developing countries, using mental discipline and making money 
less fungible by mentally allocating savings for a purpose. But M-Pawa gave her a safe, 
efficient, and reliable platform to grow her business and transform her livelihood.
Women face obstacles related to their 
gender that impair their economic performance
These obstacles include those that stem from 
women’s subordinate position in the family and 
lower decision making-power that affect busi-
ness investment decisions negatively; women’s traditional household and care responsibilities 
that impose time and travel restrictions; and tra-
ditional social norms that restrict women’s access to productive resources and services.  A database 
of more than 230 rigorous program evaluations, 
show that smart designs (including access to reli-able savings) that address these constraints head-
on can bring substantial benefits to women and 
be relatively simple to implement.  
Mobile savings hold great promise for 
empowering women entrepreneurs
Women are often disproportionately burdened 
by high transaction costs to access savings  
accounts. 
• More than 1 billion women lack access to ba-
sic financial services like bank accounts, loan 
services, and savings products. 
• Despite a half billion rise in the number of for -
mal bank accounts in 2014–2017, a stubborn 
7 point gender gap in access remains world-wide—and 9 points in developing countries.
“Smart design” has the potential to address gen-
der constraints and benefit women. 
• Access to savings accounts can change the 
economic equation for women in many parts 
of the world. 
• Women differ from one another, however, and very poor women need more than a sin-gle intervention to improve their incomes. When it comes to saving money, women are far ahead of their male counterparts. 
• Across different countries and populations, 
for every 100 women, 63 will want to open a basic savings account, compared with only 26 
men. 
• Data collected from all banks in Chile re-veal that women want savings accounts 
more than men do. Women held 101 sav-ings accounts for every 100 accounts held by 
men in 2002; by 2015 women held 139 (or 
around 11.4 million of 20 million accounts 
in 2015).
More women than men are interested in 
opening a savings account with minimal 
or no transaction costs across countries

New evidence from Indonesia and Tanzania explores the effectiveness of mobile savings
Knowing all this the Center for Global Development, with support from the ExxonMobil Foundation and in 
collaboration with research and implementing partners, further tested the power of mobile savings and business training. It launched two randomized controlled trials in 2015, in Indonesia and in Tanzania, to assess the power 
of mobile savings and training for women entrepreneurs.
Short-term results for Tanzania show that mobile savings increase savings and empower women—and quality 
business training bolsters savings and improves business practices
Results from Tanzania suggest that women’s access to 
the M-Pawa mobile savings platform had a significant impact on women’s savings and that adding business 
training enhanced the economic outcomes. 
• Both the amounts deposited and the amounts 
withdrawn increased significantly. 
• On average, women in the M-Pawa group saved three times more money weekly than women in 
the control group, while those in the M-Pawa plus business training group saved almost five times 
more.
• Business training significantly increased use of record keeping by 32% and financial planning by 
25%. • Relative to women in the control group, women who had access to M-Pawa and received business training were 4.6 percentage points more likely to 
operate a second business and, as a result, generat-
ed approximately $2 in additional monthly profits.
The mobile savings platform also had a positive sub-jective impact on women’s economic empowerment and well-being.
• The M-Pawa intervention significantly raised wom-
en’s satisfaction with their lives. 
• These women were 5.0 percentage points more likely to report being very happy and 4.8 percent-
age points more likely to report that their lives 
have improved.Indonesia—testing supply
Financial service providers received 
financial incentives to promote a new 
mobile savings product to women 
entrepreneurs. The women received training to increase uptake of mobile 
savings. Tanzania—testing demand
Women microentrepreneurs in two cities 
received access to an interest-bearing mobile savings platform, M-Pawa. Some 
women also received 12 weekly training 
sessions on business skills.
