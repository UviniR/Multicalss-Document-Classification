Abstract. Participation or engagement in unhygienic cyber practices could
ultimately harm an organization ’s information and communication technologies,
if unchecked. This present study used concepts from the theory of planned
behavior and organizational control theory to examine the effects of factors such
as attitude, subjective norms, organizational facilitators, monitoring, and self-efﬁcacy on workers ’participation in unhygienic cyber practices. A cross-
sectional survey of Nigerian professionals was used to test the formulated
hypotheses. Partial least squares technique of structural equation modeling(SEM) was used for data analysis. The results indicate that attitude toward cyber
hygiene has a negative effect on worker ’s participation in unhygienic cyber
practices; similarly, subjective norms have a negative effect on engagement insuch acts. The data did not show that organizational facilitators, self-ef ﬁcacy,
and monitoring had a meaningful impact on Nigerian workers ’participation in
unhygienic cyber practices. Implications of the study were discussed and con-tribution to the extant literature noted.

1 Introduction
Information and communication technologies (ICT) enhance societal development and
advancement across the globe [ 1]. Private and public organizations from Accra to
Zanzibar have deployed and used ICT and other digital platforms for their activities andoperations [ 2]. When processes and activities hinged on ICT platforms are compromised,
either by non-malicious mistakes or malicious attacks, the consequences of such acts canhave disastrous effects [ 3,4]. To ensure the safety of data resources, savvy organizations
and business operators often provide workers with guidelines and instructions on how to
properly use organizational ICT and other digital assets [ 3–6]. Prior research has
examined employee ICT misuse [ 5], ICT abuse [ 4], compliance, and noncompliance with
information systems (IS) security procedures [ 3–8]. These foregoing themes do not
speciﬁcally focus on employee engagement or involvement in cyber hygiene malprac-
tices [ 9,10]. Additionally, information on which factors in ﬂuence or discourage partic-
ipation in such behavior is not readily available in the noted studies.

https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-19115-3_25The proposed research study contributes to prior research by investigating the
effects of attitude, monitoring, subjective norms, organizational facilitators, and self-efﬁcacy on employee participation in unacceptable or ill-sanctioned cyber practices.
Speci ﬁcally, this study is designed to address the following research questions:
(a)What is the effect of attitude toward cyber practices on employees ’participation
in unacceptable cyber hygiene practices ? (b) What is the effect of subjective norms on
employees ’participation in unacceptable cyber hygiene practices ? (c) What is the
effect of organizational facilitators on employees ’participation in unacceptable cyber
hygiene practices ? (d) What is the effect of employees ’self-ef ﬁcacy regarding cyber
practices on their participation in unacceptable cyber hygiene practices ? (e) What is
the effect of monitoring on employees ’participation in unacceptable cyber hygiene
practices?
The study is relevant because the majority of previous work in the area of end-user
security behaviors has been conducted in the developed West [ 3–8]. Not much research
has been done in Africa [ 11–13]. Information systems (IS) issues in advanced societies
should not to be con ﬂated with those in developing parts of the world, including Africa
[11–13]. Factors that in ﬂuence employee involvement in unacceptable cyber practices in
Africa, with the Nigerian worker as an exemplar, may not necessarily be the same for aGerman or American worker. In this study, we provide a perspective of IS securitymanagement issue from a region of the world that has not been well-represented in the
extant literature. Moreover, ﬁndings from a study such as this one could provide useful
insights for the national cyber security frameworks recently launched in Africa,including Nigeria [ 14]. As well, the management of such behaviors among workers, in
the region, also bene ﬁts from empirical studies of this nature. To the best of our
knowledge, no previous research has explored the relationships between the effects ofattitude, self-ef ﬁcacy, subjective norms, organizational facilitators, and monitoring on
employee participation in unacceptable cyber practices, as this present study aims to do.
2 Literature Review
2.1 Information on End User Security Behavior and Cyber Hygiene
Various taxonomies on individual IS/ICT security behaviors are available in the extant
IS security management literature [ 15–17]. For example, Magklaras and Furnell [ 15]
discussed a model for predicting insider threats by focusing on IS misuse and abusewith examples, including data theft and stress. We build on the study by Loch et al.
[16], who identi ﬁed sources of information security threats to an organization, and
Stanton et al. [ 17], who proposed a taxonomy of end-user computer security behaviors.
The study focuses solely on human sources, e.g., employees and non-malicious acts.Actions of malicious entities, i.e., hackers, are outside the scope of this study, so arenatural disasters, i.e., ﬂood,ﬁre, and so on. Stanton et al. [ 17] categorized the nature or
acts of threats as either malicious or non-malicious. Thus, malicious end-user securitybehaviors include, for example, an employee who breaks into an employer ’s protected
IS to steal trade secrets; non-malicious end-user security behaviors include items such
as responding to spam email. A few researchers have investigated similar issues in304 P. I ﬁnedo et al.developing countries, e.g., Nigeria [ 11–13]. For example, Longe et al. [ 13] presented
an overview of criminal uses of ICTs in Sub-Saharan Africa with special emphasis onthe Nigerian 419 scam. I ﬁnedo et al. [ 12] reported on top non-malicious, counter-
productive computer security behavior engagements among employees in Nigeria.
Empirical information on workers ’cyber practices and potential determinants of such
in Africa are not readily available.
In essence, cyber hygiene refers to the practices, precautions, and steps users of
computers and other digital devices take to maintain, safeguard, and secure dataresources from intrusions and outside attacks. Here, “cyber hygiene practices ”refers to
the positive or favorable notion of the phenomenon while unhygienic cyber practices
connote unfavorable and ill-advised acts. In developing an illustrative list of unhygieniccyber practices for the study (see Table 1), we consulted prior academic literature and
practitioners ’reports on the subject matter [ 6,9,10,18].
3 Theoretical Foundations
A plethora of theories have been used to explore factors affecting end-user security
behaviors [ 19]. It is not possible to include all relevant theoretical frameworks in this
preliminary study. For illustrative purposes, we will fuse common theories such as the
theory of planned behavior (TPB) [ 20] and monitoring from the organizational control
theory (OCT) [ 21], to understand factors that impact employee involvement in unac-
ceptable cyber hygiene practices.
3.1 Theory of Planned Behavior
Ajzen [ 20] proposed the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Its three proximal pre-
dictors of behavioral intention and behavior are attitude, subjective norms, and per-ceived behavioral control. Attitude refers to an individual ’s positive or negative
feelings toward engaging in a speci ﬁed behavior. Subjective norms refer to an indi-
vidual ’s perception of what people important to him/her think about a given behavior.
Perceived behavioral control (PCB) refers to an individual ’s beliefs regarding the
efﬁcacy and resources needed to facilitate a behavior. Two sub-constructs, i.e., orga-
nizational facilitators and self-ef ﬁcacy, are used to represent PCB as research shows
these constructs are similar to it [ 8]. The former relates to resources that an organization
provides to encourage or discourage engagement in a target behavior. The latter relatesto an individual ’s ability to organize and execute courses of action required to
produce/perform a speci ﬁc behavior [ 22]. Behavior refers to an individual ’s observable
response in a given situation with respect to a given target. For the purpose of thisstudy, behavior is represented by unhygienic cyber practices. Several researchers have
used TPB to study employee compliance with acceptable IS security behaviors and
intention to use protective technologies [ 19].Factors that In ﬂuence Workers ’Participation 3053.2 Organizational Control Theory
Organizational control theory (OCT) is a multifaceted framework that describes the
process by which one party attempts to in ﬂuence the behavior of another within a given
system [ 21]. Here, it includes management mechanisms through which an organization
manages and directs the attention of its members, as well as motivates and encouragesthem, to act in accordance with its goals and objectives. The speci ﬁc aspect of OCT
considered for this present study is monitoring. Here, monitoring is the observing andchecking of workers ’computing practices over a regular basis. Other components of
OCT, e.g., reward and speci ﬁcation, will be considered in future research inquires.
Monitoring was chosen for this initial study because it provides an opportunity toinvestigate the impact of organizational efforts aimed at checking workers ’adherence
to prescribed IS security guidelines. Moreover, past researchers [e.g., 5] found moni-
toring to be relevant in understanding workers ’compliance with desired IS security
behaviors.
4 Research Model and Hypotheses
The study ’s research model is presented in Fig. 1. Discussions on the formulated
hypotheses are provided as follows:
In tune with the tenets of TPB, positive attitudes in ﬂuence favorable behavior and
conversely, negative attitudes will diminish a target behavior [ 20]. Past studies show
that employees who have positive attitudinal beliefs about their organization ’sI S
security rules are the ones that readily comply with such guidelines [ 8,19]. Thus, it is
expected that employees with positive attitudes toward cyber hygiene will have fewercompulsions to engage in unacceptable cyber hygiene practices.
H1: Attitude toward cyber hygiene negatively affect participation in unhygienic
cyber practices .
Evidence exists to support the view indicating that an individual ’s behavior is
inﬂuenced or motivated by what he or she observes to be the norm in his or her
environment [ 6,20]. With regard to following acceptable organizational IS security
rules, employees are more likely to adhere to their organization ’s ISSP if they notice
that those around them, i.e., superiors, peers, and subordinates, are complying withUnhygienic cyber practicesAttitude toward cyber hygiene

affect ISSP compliance in organizations.
H2: Subjective norms related to cyber hygiene negatively affect participation in
unhygienic cyber practices .
The availability of organizational resources facilitates a target behavior such as
compliance [ 20]. Organizational facilitators, e.g., provision of acceptable IS use policy
and the availability of IS security awareness programs, play a signi ﬁcant role in
shaping individual perceptions of acceptable ICT use in organizations [ 3,5,18]. It is
reasonable to expect that workers, in contexts where adequate organizational resourcesexist, will have less tendency to engage in ill-sanctioned computing practices andrelated acts.
H3: Organizational facilitators negatively affect participation in unhygienic cyber
practices .
An individual ’s con ﬁdence in their knowledge and skills plays an import role in
engaging in a target behavior [ 20]. With respect to compliance with acceptable IS
security guidelines and rules, past studies demonstrated that employees with higherlevels of skills and knowledge of IS security issues and consequences related to poorchoices are less inclined to indulge in unfavorable ICT use practices [ 3,8]. Those with
lower levels of knowledge do not readily follow IS security rules [ 23] and may
knowingly or unknowingly engage in unhygienic cyber practices.
H4: Self-ef ﬁcacy negatively affects participation in unhygienic cyber practices .
In accordance with OCT, management often evaluates and monitors the actions of
employees to ensure compliance with desired goals and objectives [ 21]. If a worker
believes that management does not monitor his/her computing practices (and their useof technologies at work), s/he is more likely to ﬂout acceptable directives. D ’Arcy et al.
[5] found that when employees know that computer monitoring is in place, incidents of
IS misuse drop signi ﬁcantly. Thus, it is expected that employees ’participation in
unhygienic cyber practices will likely be low if they know their organization monitors
their ICT use practices.
H5: Monitoring negatively affects participation in unhygienic cyber practices .
5 Research Methodology
5.1 Study Design, Data Collection, and Subjects
To test the formulated hypotheses, a survey research methodology was adopted. A pilot
survey was initially conducted among 25 MBA students in a local university to
enhance the content and face validities of the items used for the study. Questionnairesused in the ﬁnal survey were administered to working MBA students in a university in
Lagos, which is the commercial capital of Nigeria; participation was voluntary. Of the125 questionnaires distributed, 76 were returned; thus, the effective response rate forthe study was 60.8%. The response rate is considered adequate for a study such as thisone. Incomplete responses and poorly completed responses were excluded from sub-sequent data analysis. In all, 71 responses were used for the study.Factors that In ﬂuence Workers ’Participation 307Demographic information about the respondents is presented as follows: 37 are
males (52.1%) and 20 are females (28.2%); the data has missing entries. Many of them(49%) have bachelor ’s degrees and 25% have other master ’s degrees. In the sample,
42.3%, 18.3%, and 15.5% of respondents were in the 21 to 30, 31 to 40, and 41 to 50
age ranges, respectively. The participants ’average years of computer use is 11.5 years
(standard deviations [S.D.] = 6.8) and they have 4.6 years (S.D. = 3.4) tenure at theircurrent organizations. Some participants noted their job titles as accountant, softwareengineer, system analyst, project manager, internet scammer, lecturer, and customerservice manager. Forty-two (42) are IT professionals and the rest are non-IT personnel.Diverse industries such as IT, manufacturing, banking, education, and so forth wererepresented in the sample. The data sample included an even distribution of organi-zation size and annual revenue.
The survey collected both independent and dependent data from the same source;
this could lead to common method bias (CMB) [ 24]. The procedures recommended to
account for the effects of CMB were followed [ 24]. For example, respondent anon-
ymity was assured and questions in the survey were ordered in a randomized manner.Additionally, two post-hoc statistical analyses to further reduce concerns related to thepresence of CMB were used. First, Harman ’s one-factor test was conducted for the
reﬂective, independent constructs. The results showed that ﬁve factors were extracted;
theﬁrst factor explained 39.8% of the variance. Second, Pavlou et al. [ 25] suggest that
an inter-construct correlation higher than 0.9 is a possible indicator of CMB. There
were no correlations in Table 2above 0.90 to further show CMB was not a problem for
our data. Both tests indicated that CMB was not problematic for the collected data.
5.2 Operationalization of the Constructs
Measuring items used to represent the unhygienic cyber practices construct were taken
from the following sources [ 6,9,10,18]. The dependent construct was modeled as a
formative construct because its constituting variables measure differing phenomena.
Table 1shows the questionnaire items used for the formative construct and their
descriptive statistics. The study ’s participants were asked the question: “Please indicate
how often you participate in the listed unhygienic cyber practices listed in Table 1.”
Their responses were assessed on a seven-point scale ranging from “Almost never ”
(1) to “Almost always ”(7). The four (4) measures for attitude toward cyber hygiene,
which include “Following the organization ’s IS security policy is a good idea ”, were
taken constructs that have been validated [ 8,22]. Four (4) items for the subjective
norms construct were adapted from [ 7,8] as well with an example: “My boss thinks
that I should follow the organization ’s IS security policy ”. For the four (4) measuring
items used for organizational facilitators, we used items such as “My organization has
established rules of behavior for use of computer resources and other digital assets ”;
this was modi ﬁ
ed from [ 5,18]. The self-ef ﬁcacy construct has items adapted from
Bandura [ 22]; items in the construct include “I have basic knowledge on how to avoid
unhygienic cyber practices. ”Five (5) measuring items adapted from D ’Arcy et al. [ 5]308 P. I ﬁnedo et al.were used to operationalize the monitoring construct. An example includes “I believe
that my organization monitors its employees ’cyber practices and engagements. ”As
indicated, the measuring items used for the re ﬂective, independent constructs have been
validated in prior studies. All the items were assessed on a seven-point scale ranging
from “Strongly disagree ”(1) to “Strongly agree ”(7).

Data analysis was done using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) technique of structural
equation modeling (SEM), which is suitable for theory testing [ 26]. PLS supports the
use of small sample sizes and does not impose data normality requirements [ 26,27].
WarpPLS 5.0 software was used for this study [ 27]. PLS supports both formative and
reﬂective models and recognizes two components of a causal model: the measurement
and structural models.
6.1 Measurement Model
For the re ﬂective constructs, item reliability, composite reliability, and convergent and
discriminant validities were examined. Item loadings above 0.7 are recommended [ 26]
in assessing item reliability. Item loadings from 0.700 to 0.933 were obtained for thestudy (they were not presented due to space limitations). Composite reliability higherthan 0.707 for each construct is preferred [ 26]; results obtained in this regard are
presented in Table 2to satisfy this criterion. In addition, convergent and discriminant
validities were assessed using the following criteria: (a) the average variance extracted
(AVE) should be no less than 0.707 (i.e., the AVE should be above the threshold valueof 0.50); (b) the square root of AVE should be larger than the correlations between thatconstruct and all other constructs; and (c) the items should load more strongly on theirrespective constructs than on other constructs. This requirement for “c”was met but not
included due to space consideration; however, information relating to the AVEs isprovided in Table 2. All AVEs are above the recommended threshold of 0.50.

SEF = Self-ef ﬁcacy, CYB = Unhygienic cyber practice310 P. I ﬁnedo et al.For the formative construct, i.e., unhygienic cyber practices, the presence of mul-
ticollinearity is checked and the item weights evaluated. Excessive collinearity withinformative scales is problematic for a construct. To assess multicollinearity among thevariables, the variance in ﬂation factors (VIF) are checked. VIFs below the conservative
cutoff of 3.33 are considered adequate [ 28]. Items weights show how signi ﬁcantly
linked item indicators are to their speci ﬁed constructs; weights with statistical signif-
icance are preferred [ 28]. Table 1shows that VIFs and item weights used to capture the
dependent variable are adequate. Namely, all VIFs are below 3.33 and the weights aresigniﬁcant at p < 0.10 level.
6.2 Structural ModelF
The structural model provides information about the path signi ﬁcance ( b) of hypoth-
esized relationships and the coef ﬁcient of determination, squared R (R
2)[26]. WarpPLS
5.0 results for the bs and the R2are shown in Fig. 2(* indicates signi ﬁcance at p < 0.5
level). The independent variables explained 19% of the variance in the dependent
variable to show the model has signi ﬁcant value [ 26]. WarpPLS 5.0 also provides
information on Goodness of Fit (GoF), which is a global ﬁt measure that accounts for
both measurement and structural model performance [ 29]. The GoF obtained for this
study is 0.33, which is close to the cut-off value of 0.36 for large effect sizes [ 30].
Consistent with H1, attitude toward cyber hygiene has a negative effect on par-
ticipation in unhygienic cyber practices ( b=−0.21, p < 0.05). H2, which predicted
that subjective norms would have a negative effect on participation in unhygienic cyberpractices ( b=−0.12, p < 0.05), was con ﬁrmed as well. The data did not support H3;
namely, organizational facilitators were not found to have a negative effect on par-ticipation in unhygienic cyber practices ( b= 0.03, p = 0.41). Support was not found
for H4, which predicted that self-ef ﬁcacy negatively affected participation in unhy-
gienic cyber practices ( b= 0.09, p = 0.17). H5 was uncon ﬁrmed; monitoring was not
found to have a negative effect on participation in unhygienic cyber practices
(b= 0.28, p < 0.01). The path is statistically signi ﬁcant; however, the result is
inconsistent with the stated prediction.
Fig. 2. The PLS result.Factors that In ﬂuence Workers ’Participation 3117 Discussions and Conclusion
The study ’s main objective was to examine the effects of relevant factors taken from
TPB and OCT on workers ’participation in unhygienic cyber practices. Our result
conﬁrmed that Nigerian workers with favorable attitudes toward cyber hygiene were
more likely to shun participation in unhygienic cyber practices. This result supports
prior studies [ 6–8] that showed individual attitudes towards end-user security practices
are an important factor that modi ﬁes engagement in desired IS security behaviors. We
found that the sampled Nigerian workers were more likely to avoid participation inunhygienic cyber practices if they believed signi ﬁcant others, i.e., colleagues in their
workplaces, did not approve of such practices or acts. This ﬁnding is consistent with
the espoused viewpoint indicating that group approval of safe and acceptable com-puting behaviors augurs well for compliance with the sanctioned organization ’sI S
procedures and rules [ 6–8].
The result indicating that organizational facilitators mattered less for Nigerian
workers with respect to their engagements in unhygienic cyber practices could beexplained by contextual factors. The result is at odds with observations in a developedcountry that indicated that organizational facilitators help to prevent employeeengagement in nonmalicious IS security acts [ 18]. It is possible that the sampled
participants are employed in organizations where organizational resources are inade-quate or lacking. For example, during an informal discussion with the researchers, one
participant commented that “the attention of my company is on how to increase its
market capitalization; issues like IS security is not [company X] priority. ”We found no
meaningful association between Nigerian workers ’self-ef ﬁcacy and participation in
unhygienic cyber practices. The result in this aspect might indicate that the sampledworkers may not believe they possess suf ﬁcient skills and knowledge to help them deal
with cyber issues or related practices. This might be discouraging given that paststudies [ 6–8,19] from developed countries have shown that adequate levels of skills,
capabilities, and knowledge of end-user IS security issues are pertinent for suppressing
involvement in ill-sanctioned computing behaviors. It is somewhat surprising that the
relationship between monitoring and the dependent construct was unsupported in ourresearch setting. Prior IS security studies that used monitoring found it to be animportant mechanism for shaping behavioral intentions to comply with acceptable rules[5]. Our result shows that more monitoring seems to lead to more participation in
unhygienic cyber practices. A plausible explanation for the lack of support for H5might be due to extraneous factors. For example, it is possible that the sampled par-ticipants are unperturbed by IS security directives and monitoring in their organizations
or are able to circumvent such efforts through neutralization techniques [ 31]. To some
degree, their profession or occupation might also have an in ﬂuential role. Recall most
of the study ’s participants are IT professionals and four (4) of them candidly indicated
they are internet scammers. Evidence exists to show that employees likely to ﬂout
organizational IS security directives are those with more advanced IT know-how [ 3].312 P. I ﬁnedo et al.7.1 Contributions to Research and Implications for Practice
This study is one of the ﬁrst of its kind to investigate worker ’s participation in
unhygienic cyber practices by using perspectives from TPB and OCT. No previousstudy has considered the effects of the selected variables on the dependent constructwith data collected from Africa. This study offers support for the applicability of TPBand OCT in understanding employee participation in unhygienic cyber practices inwork settings. Findings of the study lend credence to prior studies emphasizing theroles of attitudinal beliefs and subjective norms in shaping desired behaviors. There are
implications of the study ’sﬁndings for practice, in particular, the management of
workers in Nigeria in relation to their discouraging participation in unhygienic cyberpractices in work environments. Management can better control workers ’behaviors
with respect to the phenomenon by proactively providing incentives (e.g., campaigns,training) that can enhance positive attitudes towards favorable cyber hygiene practices.Well-tailored communication could also in ﬂuence attitudes toward desired behavior.
Given the importance of subjective norms in reducing employees ’engagement in
unhygienic cyber practices, management should ensure concerns related to acceptable
cyber practices are regularly discussed at department meetings and widely situated in
the social functioning of the enterprise. In ﬂuential persons in the organization could be
given the responsibility to act as “champions ”of the cause of promoting good cyber
hygiene practices [ 7]. It is likely that the amount of variance explained in the research
model could increase further if more favorable organizational facilitators are madeavailable to workers. Similarly, identifying speci ﬁc measures that can enhance work-
er’s self-ef ﬁcacy in relation to cyber practices could help produce more fruitful results.
Reliance on monitoring mechanisms may not be totally effective in a context where
workers possess above average ICT/IS knowledge; deterrence and sanction mecha-
nisms may be needed to ensure compliance [ 4,7].
7.2 Study ’s Limitations and Future Research Directions
There are several limitations to this study. First, the data came from a cross-sectional
ﬁeld survey; longitudinal data may facilitate more insight. Second, the data was
obtained from Nigerian workers. Findings in this preliminary study may not beapplicable to workers in other parts of Africa; perceptions may vary across the con-tinent. Third, the sample is small. Fourth, although CMB was not problematic for thisstudy, it is still possible that participants might have provided “socially desirable
responses ”[24] to some of the issues being investigated. Future studies could over-
come the noted shortcomings in this study. Comparative studies on the continent and
elsewhere could be conducted. Attention should be paid to other end-user securitybehaviors such as those related to malicious acts. Other aspects of OCT, e.g., reward,could be explored. Likewise, other relevant theories in the area of IS security man-agement [ 19] could be used to study the phenomenon and case studies could be used to
enhance insights.Factors that In ﬂuence Workers ’Participation 313References
