Maritime cybersecurity is developing as an issue that affects the ocean. Recent
security breaches cost shipping companies hundreds of millions of dollars andput marine ecosystems at risk by disabling ship controls and increasing risksof collisions and hazmat spills. Additionally, most new ships are designed totransmit engine performance data ashore to allow timely maintenance and ef ﬁ-
cient operation. However, many ships still prohibit such data transmission dueto security concerns, resulting in increased ship emissions and environmental
risks from accidental release of oil, hydraulic ﬂuids, or lubricants. Similarly, re-
search vessel data are routinely sent ashore, but security concerns for their com-puters are also increasing, especially when they operate in global ports andoceans. Maritime cybersecurity is also critical as autonomous ships are being de-veloped. Addressing maritime cybersecurity is therefore a valid area of scienti ﬁc
policy research and important for ocean science operations.
The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has called for improved mari-
time cybersecurity, and the U.S. Coast Guard also recently released a Navigationand Vessel Inspection Circular (NVIC; NVIC 05-17) on maritime cybersecurity forcomments. The newly established Maritime Cyber Security Committee of theMarine Technology Society is coordinating maritime cybersecurity best practiceinformation, contacts for cybersecurity professionals, and lessons learned on re-sponding to cyberattacks to make this information broadly available. We reviewhere various stakeholder approaches to maritime cybersecurity, outline availableresources, and discuss how advanced methods, including optical communica-tions and quantum encryption, will improve maritime cybersecurity. Scientistshave a role in developing and implementing maritime cybersecurity methodsand policies to ensure safe ship operations and improved environmental security
for the oceans.

Background and
Introduction: TheScope of the Problem
Shipping has continued to in-
crease in importance in global trade,complete with subsidies from variouscountries to increase their proportionof this lucrative market (cf. Anonymous,2014). In an era when the Internet-of-things is beginning to extend toships, this puts ship and shippers ’
computer systems at an increasingrisk (Quaintance, 2017). Ships thatwere built to continuously transmitdata on engine and ship systems ’sta-
tus ashore to enable just-in-time diag-
nostics and repairs in some caseshave had these systems intentionallydisabled due to security concernswith the transmission of such data.The recent hack of Maersk shippinglines in June 2017, which caused theshutdown of Maersk operations in13 international ports and losses of$300M, was a wake-up call to manyabout the seriousness of maritimecybersecurity risks (Baraniuk, 2017).However, there have been numerousother cases of shipping hacks, with re-
portedly over 300 unclassi ﬁed reports
of such hacks to date. In some cases,cybersecurity breaches involvedcompromising the information forcontainers aboard or of ﬂoaded from
ships so that they could be stolen(Baraniuk, 2017; Hayes, 2016).Some hacks have shut down bridgeoperations with ransomware de-mands, or ship navigation ElectronicChart Display and Information Sys-tems (ECDIS) system security ﬂaws
were targeted (Luciano, 2017). Atminimum, these put ships out of op-eration for some period of time, andshipping companies suffer ﬁnancial
losses from inability to sustain normaloperations. In other cases, such as theClarkson shipping hack (Anonymous,2017g), where the hack allowed ma-nipulation of ship manifest lists withpotential smuggling of containers,these hacks have potentially further
44 Marine Technology Society Journaldamaged the company ’s reputation by
possibly putting client information atrisk as well (Wingrove, 2017). The mar-itime cybersecurity hacks are not limitedto commercial shipping or hacker ac-tivity alone; they have also been under-taken by governments such as North
Korea and Russia and deployed against
commercial and military vessels, mostlyby hacking or spoo ﬁng GPS, Automatic
[ship] Identi ﬁcation System (AIS), or
ECDIS systems (Dunn, 2017; Vaas,2017). The risk from positional spoof-ing was judged so probable, that as of2015, the U.S. Naval Academy beganagain requiring its personnel to under-go training in celestial navigation fortheﬁrst time in a decade (Vaas, 2017;
Zorabedian, 2015).
The military aspect of maritime
cybersecurity is not at all lost in thearea of national defense, for whichwarnings have been coming forsome time (cf. Hayes, 2016; Lyngaas,2015). Federal agencies responsible
for the safety of shipping, including
particularly the U.S. Coast Guard,have been interested in how best toapproach the problem of providingstandards and guidance for cybersecuritycompliance for shipping (cf. Heckmanet al., 2017). It is clear from cyber pen-etration tests that the majority of marineshipping vessels are vulnerable to cyber-attacks (Naval Dome, 2017b). Thequestion facing industries using ships,as well as ports and federal and interna-tional agencies, is how best to addressthis issue.
Approaches to
Cybersecurity FromIndustry, Federal, and
International Agencies
There are questions as to whether
it is best to look at the means used to
address maritime cybersecurity issuesfrom a “top-down ”approach, that is,
from international and federal agencyplans/mandates, or a “bottom-up ”
approach, that is, the one used by theindustry, which often moves morerapidly than governments to addresssecurity issues. The shipping industry,
which can suffer ﬁnancial losses from
cybersecurity attacks, has long beenworking to improve vessel trackingand position reporting using real-time AIS methods, which at least the-oretically (if not hacked) let themknow where their assets are located(Schill, 2017). Shipping companiesand satellite communications compa-nies used by the shipping industryhave turned their attention to cyber-security issues, releasing their ownrecommendations (cf. DNV GL AS,2016) and calling for the interna-tional development and enforcementof cybersecurity standards for datamanagement via the InternationalMaritime Organization (IMO) and
American Bureau of Shipping (ABS)
(Anonymous, 2016, 2017d). The oiland gas industry has an Oil Com-panies International Marine Forum(OCIMF) that administers a Ship In-spection Report Program (SIRE),which in 2018 added a cybersecurityrequirement for all vessels subject tothose inspections (Anonymous,2018a). These actions by industryhave been re ﬂected in the prominence
of this issue in a number of industryshipping conferences (U.K. Port &Harbor Conference [Parsons, 2016];GST Shipping 2030 Conference;Maritime Risk Symposium, 2017[Gianfalla, 2017; Hudson, 2017];and Port Security Technology Con-
ference, 2017). Cybersecurity is also
a general issue of interest for theJapanese Port and Airport ResearchInstitute (PARI, 2017) and speci ﬁc
ports such as the Port of Long Beach(Parsons, 2016) and Port of Los
Angeles, the highest shipping valueport in the United States (>$140B in2014; Noll, 2017), which has estab-lished a centralized Cyber Lab to com-bat a torrent of cyber-hacking attacksdaily (Anonymous, 2017f ). In 2016,
the IMO released “Interim Guidelines
on Maritime Cyber Risk Manage-ment, ”which were ﬁnalized in 2017
(IMO, 2016, 2017) and are to be im-plemented on ships by 2021. Addi-tionally, in late 2017, the IMOlaunched a network of ﬁve global cen-
ters of excellence in marine technol-ogy, called Maritime TechnologyCooperation Centers (MTCCs),which should improve the adoptionof these cybersecurity standards inter-nationally (Anonymous, 2017h). Acompilation of industry maritimecybersecurity guidance from diversesources may be found at http://becyberawareatsea.com/guidance; onecomponent of which is shown in
Figure 1.
These industry initiatives have
been supplemented within the UnitedKingdom by the release of guidancedocuments from the U.K. NationalCyber Security Centre (2018) and aU.K. Vessel Code of Practice for ship-ping, from their Department ofTransport (Boyes & Isbell, 2017).Within the European Union (EU),theﬁrst maritime cybersecurity assess-
ment was done in 2011, and subse-quent general security reports havealso been promulgated, which call fortraining and cooperation but are notfocused on cybersecurity (EuropeanAgency for Network and InformationSecurity [ENISA], 2011; EU, 2014).
Beginning in May 2018, the EU adds
two new pieces of cybersecurity leg-islation that will have broad effects:the EU General Data ProtectionRegulation (GDPR), for which stiff
September/October 2018 Volume 52 Number 5 45penalties for noncompliance can be
levied against companies doing busi-
ness in the EU, and the Network In-formation Security (NIS) Directive,which is left up to individual membercountries to enforce (Anonymous,2018a).
Within the United States, the
issue of maritime cybersecurity fallsamong several federal agencies.There is an obvious defense compo-nent to cybersecurity. In 2017, theU . S .C y b e rC o m m a n dw a ss p l i tfrom the National Security Agency,and independent commands wereestablished within the Army andNavy, both of which are now opera-tional (Baldor, 2017; Obsorn, 2017).Understandably, ship cybersecurity
for national defense lies principally
with the Navy as one component ofan overall Navy defense strategy forthe future (Richardson, 2016). Withinthe realm of federal guidance on cyber-
security, the National Research Coun-
cil (NRC) and the National Academiesof Science, Engineering, and Medicine(NAS) have produced a series of re-ports dealing with cybersecurity,including a review of existing cyber-challenges, how the country canimprove its cybersecurity, how it canbetter deter cyberattacks, what isrequired in terms of internationalpolicy initiatives, how transportationinfrastructure can be protected, andhow public policies interface withexecuting cybersecurity initiatives(NAS, 2007, 2010, 2015, 2016,2017a, 2017b, 2017c; NRC, 2014).Partially, as a result of these reports,the Of ﬁce of the President issued an
Executive Order (EO) in May 2017
on cybersecurity for federal networksand critical infrastructure, which hassince been a subject of discussion inattempts to clarify the speci ﬁcs and
practicalities of the path forward(Anonymous, 2017e; Lohrmann,2017; Trump, 2017).
Additionally, in the areas of cyber-
security research, the National ScienceFoundation (NSF) has established a
Cybersecurity Center of Excellence
and Center for Trusted Scienti ﬁc
Cyberinfrastructure (NSF, 2016,2017). Likewise, for more appliedcybersecurity technologies, the DefenseAdvanced Research Agency (DARPA)has tapped Rockwell Collins to assist inprotecting computers, including thoseon unmanned systems, from cyber-intrusions through its partnership inthe DARPA High-Assurance MilitarySystems (HACMS) program (Anony-mous, 2017b). DARPA has alsomore recently initiated solicitationsfor the Harnessing Autonomy forCountering Cyberadversary Systems(HACCS) program for land, sea, andsatellite assets (DARPA, 2017; Lane
et al., 2017) and also for the Con ﬁgu-
rational Security (ConSec) program,which is aimed at automating com-puter systems con ﬁguration manage-
ment to minimize risks of cyberattacks(Keller, 2017b).
Within the Department of Trans-
portation, the U.S. Maritime Admin-istration (MARAD) has also issuedguidance about the cybersecurityof essential transportation systems,including certi ﬁcation of commer-
cial carrier and passenger vessels(MARAD, 2017). General guidanceon cybersecurity methods are providedby the U.S. National Institute ofStandards and Technology (NIST)as directed by the 2013 Presidential
EO 13686, Improving Critical Infra-
structure, Cybersecurity, as well as theCybersecurity Enhancement Act of2014 (Public Law 113-294). In responseto these directives, NIST developed

46 Marine Technology Society Journaland released a Cybersecurity Frame-
work Version 1.0 in 2013 and a Version1.1 on April 16, 2018. The key com-ponents of the V.1.0 Frameworkw e r et op r o v i d eg u i d a n c eo ni d e n t i -fying cybersecurity needs for organi-zations, methods to accomplish
those cybersecurity needs in terms
of cyber protection, detection of cy-bersecurity breaches, planning for re-sponses to such breaches, and recoveryfrom breaches (see http://www.nisto.gov).
Additionally, NIST has also fo-
cused on the National Initiative forCybersecurity Education (NICE),part of which is the establishment ofa Cybersecurity Workforce Frame-work that recognizes that trainingpersonnel is also a key componentof enabling cybersecurity (NIST,2018a, 2018b) (see Figure 2).
For maritime cybersecurity, the
Department of Homeland Security(DHS) deals with the security of criti-
cal infrastructure (cf. http://www.dhs.
gov/stakeholder-engagement-and-cyber-infrastructure-resilience),including ports and harbors.Furthermore, as a component ofDHS, the U.S. Coast Guard deals
speci ﬁcally with the safety and
security of shipping as well as ports.A recent issue of the “Coast Guard
Proceedings ”was dedicated to
maritime cybersecurity and featured aseries of articles on various aspects of
this topic (cf. Goldstein & Kneidinger,
2014/2015; http://uscgproceedings.epubxp.com/i/436751-win-2015/47).However, the U.S. Coast Guard is notitself an agency with a speci ﬁce x p e r t i s e
in cybersecurity technologies, and itcannot impose its own suggestionsor requirements about cybersecuritypractices on other countries or inter-national companies. Instead, theCoast Guard has sought to engagewith the broader maritime com-munity to work synergistically towardimproved cybersecurity, establishcybersecurity best practices, andpromote compliance with theserecommendations. In July 2017, theCoast Guard released a Navigation
and Vessel Inspection Circular
(NVIC) Number 05-17, called“Guidelines for Addressing Cyber
Risks at Maritime TransportationSecurity Act (MTSA) Facilities ”(Federal Register, 2017, and/or
Manning, 2017). This documentreferred to the Coast Guard CyberStrategy document (U.S. CoastGuard, 2015) and called for publiccomments on how best to addressthe issues of maritime cybersecurity
in relation to its proposed policies
and procedures intended to mitigatecybersecurity risks. These procedurescall for ship owners and operatorsto conduct cyber risk pro ﬁle assess-
ments as part of their facility securityplans. The NVIC also lays out bestpractices for cybersecurity derivedfrom NIST guidelines, includingguidelines on personnel responsibili-ties relating to cybersecurity. The re-quest for comments also included asolicitation for comments relatingto how the guidance provided by theCoast Guard would need to be up-dated in the face of newly developingtechnologies.
Cyberattack Reporting
Requirements or WhoYa Gonna Call?
There have been many discussions
about preventing cyberattacks, butthere also needs to be a broader dis-semination of what protocols needto be followed when there is a cyber-security breach; most ship crews andmanagement agencies do not knowwhat to do if they are hacked. Fromthe shipping company viewpoint,this is not only a cybersecurity issue;there can also be serious ﬁnancial
costs if shipping operations are shutdown. So what are the protocols forresponding to a cyber-breach? Heckmanet al. (2017) provide a fairly compre-hensive list of U.S. Coast Guard and
industry approaches to this issue.
Coast Guard guidance on “ReportingFIGURE 2
The NIST NICE has established a Cybersecurity Workforce Framework that is intended to ensure
a cyber-workforce is developed that can monitor and administer cybersecurity standards cor-
rectly (NIST, 2018a, 2018b).
September/October 2018 Volume 52 Number 5 47Suspicious Activity and Breaches of
Security ”(December 2016) notes
that information reported to theCoast Guard is “not subject to routine
public disclosure, ”so that the Coast
Guard wants to be informed of securitybreaches, but they will not disclose
such information publicly, in ways
that might affect the business of anycompany whose security has beenbreached. This same guidance callsfor maritime security breaches to be re-ported to the National Response Center(NRC; 1-800-424-8802), as well asnoting that reports can and shouldalso be made to respective Captainsof the Port(s) and also the NationalCybersecurity and CommunicationsIntegration Center (NCCIC; 1-888-282-0870), which is a 24/7 cyber situa-tional awareness center that links federaland intelligence agencies with law en-forcement agencies. Reports to the lat-ter should speci ﬁcally include mention
to the NCCIC that the reporting com-
ponent is a Coast Guard –regulated
entity, so that their data will be for-warded appropriately to the NRCa n dC o a s tG u a r d( a n da l s ot h eF B I ) .The EU (Europol) also has a URL forreporting cyber-incidents, https://www.europol.europa.eu/report-a-crime/report-cybercrime-online,with reporting criteria that vary bycountry.
So these are the reporting require-
ments from the Coast Guard and/orEuropol, but how does this assist inresponding with a cybersecuritybreach? There will be some assistanceforthcoming from the agencies report-ed above automatically, but those thathave been breached can also speci-
ﬁcally request assistance from the
Industrial Control Systems CyberEmergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) (https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/),which, like the other federal agenciesinvolved, has published their own
“Recommended Practices ”advice (cf.
https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/Introduction-Recommended-Practices). As notedabove, the NCCIC and NRC report-ing mandated by the Coast Guardalso goes to the FBI. The FBI ’s“Infra-
Guard ”program and its webpage
“iGuardian ”(cf. https://www.fbi.gov/
resources/law-enforcement/iguardian)a r eaj o i n te f f o r tw i t ht h eb u s i n e s scommunity established in 2013speciﬁcally to protect critical national
infrastructure by providing a cyber-
breach reporting mechanism andactivating triage response to industryfor cybersecurity breaches.
If a shipping company or port sus-
pects that they may have been breachedand wants to see what other activity ina similar vein may have taken place,they can access the National SuspiciousActivity Reporting (SAR) Initiativewebpage (https://nsi.ncirc.gov/). Notethat this webpage is not for reporting
incidents but contains a log of reported
incidents jointly maintained by DHS,the FBI, and local law enforcementagencies. Additionally, the CoastGuard recommends that vessel andfacility operators participate in theirlocal Area Maritime Security Commit-tees (AMSCs) (http://www.dco.uscg.mil/Portals/9/CG-FAC/Documents/AMSC%20Consolidated%20reports/2016/AMSC%202016%20Annual%20Report%20(signed).pdf?ver=2017-11-08-084656-947), contactinformation from which can beobtained from the nearest Captains ofthe Ports or by contacting the CoastGuard Of ﬁce of Port and Facility
Compliance (202-372-1132).
The Question of Methods
Certain cybersecurity approaches
are focused on securing internal com-puter systems and preventing hack-
ing into those systems (cf. PASGlobal, 2017). Version 1.1 of theNIST Cybersecurity Framework in-
cluded a more detailed consideration
of validating the identity of online en-tities to enable more secure manage-ment of supply chain cybersecurity,which included expanded focus onthe NIST Trusted Identities Group(TIG). The TIG began in 2015 as aseries of pilot programs where thegovernment would certify the identityof commercial partners through an
Identity Ecosystem Framework
(IDEF) established through privatesector partnerships that established anIDEF Registry, which provided au-thentication credentials for compa-nies at three assurance levels thatthey were who they said they were.Among other things, such assurancein Version 1.1 was updated to removethe option of one-time passwords via
email and limit them to SMS messages
(text messages to cell phones) as well asthe use of security tokens, becausethose could be stolen. Three Authenti-cation Assurance Levels (AALs) wereestablished, where in AAL 1, reauthen-tication was required every 30 days;AAL 2, every 30 min of online use;and AAL 3, every 15 min of onlineuse. These reauthentications could be
done by self-assertion, remote identi ﬁ-
cation assertion proof, or in-personprooﬁng. One consequence of the
adoption of these new requirementsby some federal agency vessels in theearly summer of 2018 was that thebandwidth required for such securityreauthorizations overwhelmed theavailable ship satellite communicationbandwidth and effectively shut down
ship communication systems until,
weeks later, additional satellite band-width contracts and software and reau-thorization frequency adjustments
48 Marine Technology Society Journalcould be put in place —one indication
of the unexpected consequences ofthe attempted implementation ofthese new cybersecurity requirements
in an industry where satellite com-
munications bandwidth is far morelimited than nonmaritime computernetworks.
Other approaches have been di-
rected at securing communicationswith systems outside an internal com-puter system, as is inherently the casebetween ports and ships, and shipsand ship managers. Wireless commu-nications with satellites have one in-teresting security communicationsprotocol initially funded by NASAfor the Interplanetary Internet thatwas developed by Vinton Cerf.
There was a need for a new protocol
for the Interplanetary Internet be-cause communicating with distantspacecraft involved delays and disrup-tions for which the usual Internetprotocols were insuf ﬁcient. Therefore,
Cerf developed delay and disruption-tolerant wireless networking (DTN)protocols, which overcame those lim-itations of standard Internet commu-nication protocols. As it happened,the DTN protocol also had an advan-tage in providing higher bandwidththan other wireless communicationprotocols, while also providing highlevels of communications security(cf. the Internet Engineering ResearchGroup DTN webpage, https://irtf.
org/concluded/dtnrg). Once developed,
the DTN protocol has been used toprovide secure communicationsbetween unmanned systems, includingmultiple networked autonomousunderwater vehicles (AUVs), surfacevessels (ships and autonomous surfacevessels [ASVs]), and manned andunmanned aircraft (McGillivary et al.,2012a, 2012b). The DTN method isnow being adopted for free-spaceoptical communications by a
consortium including NASA and theU.S. Naval Research Lab, andcommercial satellite communicationsoperators. For optical communi-cations, just as for wireless communi-cations, use of the DTN protocol will
again improve performance if data
transmissions are interrupted for anyreason but will also help to ensure thesecurity of optical communications.Efforts to develop underwater opticalcommunications are also under way inearnest (cf. Baghdady et al., 2016a,2016b) and remain a goal for navalforces (Keller, 2017a), for whichDTN protocols will also be useful.
Industry has developed its own ap-
proaches for dealing with both internaland shore-to-ship communicationscybersecurity, and there has been a par-ticular emphasis on cybersecurity with-in the oil and gas industry. The oil andgas industry is heavily involved in ship-ping (cf. Goel, 2017) and has been the
subject of hacks with potentially very
dangerous consequences (Bensalhia,2015; Groll, 2017; Paganini, 2015).Among the approaches suggested toimprove cybersecurity is the use ofmodi ﬁed hashing methods instead of
encryption (Jackson, 2014) ormethods of format-preserving encryp-tion (FPE; Roy, 2017). However, an-other method that appears to be underconsideration for broader implementa-tion is the use of machine learningmethods to analyze data networks innear-real time, a method commonlycalled Continuous Diagnostics andMitigation (CDM) (Anonymous,2015; Goldstein & Kneidinger,2014/2015; Martin & Rajasekaran,
2016). CDM methods will continue
to be valuable as machine learningand arti ﬁcial intelligence methods are
increasingly used in cybersecurity sys-tems. However, as several NationalAcademy reports on cybersecurity have
noted, pushing software updates andcontinuing to improve cybersecuritymethods remain problematic (NAS,2017a, 2017b, 2017c).
Autonomous Vessels and
Unmanned Shipping
A decade ago, long-range unmanned
ASVs of varying sorts were being de-veloped, from the wave-poweredWave Gliders (http://www.liquidr.com) (McGillivary & Hine, 2007;McGillivary et al., 2007); to “robo-
kayaks ”(Curcio et al., 2006) and un-
manned sailboats, such as the more recentSaildrone (http://www.saildrone.com); tomore conventionally fueled ASVs, suchas the WAM-V (http://www.wam-v.com), and now more recent similarsystems. The use for ASV technologyinitially was mostly in open-ocean set-tings, away from shipping and shippingroutes, where they did not need rapidautonomous control systems and colli-sion avoidance technologies. However,
as command/control systems and posi-
tioning and other collision avoidancetechnologies developed, it was rapidlyclear that ASVs could be used for portand harbor security (see Figure 3)(Thomas, 2017) and military uses(Tuttle, 2016). Following the develop-ment of operational protocols for safenavigation of ASVs (e.g., Kuwataet al., 2014) that were gradually agreedupon by various national and interna-tional organizations, it became clearthat commercial development of au-tonomous shipping was possible, atleast on a trial basis, and many arguedthat it might actually be safer thans h i p sm a n n e db yh u m a n s( A n o n y -mous, 2017a; Levander, 2017). Com-
mercial interests aimed speci ﬁcally
at developing unmanned shipping
September/October 2018 Volume 52 Number 5 49inevitably arose from both traditional
shipping companies like DNV GL,
Rolls Royce, and Wallenius Wilhelm-sen and newer ﬁrms like One Sea
(Anonymous, 2017c). This has led tothe development of recommended pro-cedures from Lloyd ’s (2016) study and
the establishment of ports and harborsas test-beds for unmanned shipping, in-cluding the Port of Rotterdam in Hol-land (Port of Rotterdam, 2018;Rademaker, 2017). A large-scale test-bed for unmanned shipping technol-ogies was also established in TrondheimFjord in Norway, operated jointly withthe Norwegian University of Scienceand Technology (NTNU) throughtheir Centre for Autonomous MarineOperations and Systems (AMOS)
(NTNU, 2018a). Beyond just the
complexities of spatial sensors andship command and control software,the cybersecurity of this informationhas also been an integral concern forthe NTNU program, which includesan important component of collabora-tion with the NTNU Center for Cyberand Information Security (CCIS)
(NTNU, 2018b), so that commercial
operations of unmanned ships are de-fended against cyberattacks. Cyber-security continues to be an essentialcomponent of the development of un-manned shipping operations and onethat will continue to require researchas well as education of personnel to de-velop, monitor, and administer cyber-security programs within the shippingindustry. This means people will haveto be educated in maritime cybersecurity,for both manned and unmanned ship-ping operations, as well as in the rap-idly expanding world of ASVs.
The Role of Education and
Outreach in Advancing
Maritime Cybersecurity
The coming need for establishing
standards and training programs toproduce more cybersecurity specialists
f o ra l la r e a so ft h ee c o n o m yi sw e l l
known (Platt, 2015). Within the na-tional framework of the U.S. ap-
proach to cybersecurity, NIST hasfocused on the fact that successfulcyber-secure systems require peopletrained in their development and op-eration (see Figure 2) (NIST, 2018b).A number of U.S. universities and
colleges have established computer
security programs. However, as com-puter connectedness within the ship-ping industry increases, there alsoneeds to be an increase in cyber-security instruction by universities fo-cused on maritime operations. Onerecent development that may assistin this regard was the Congressionalpassage of new Maritime Centers ofExcellence, which are based aroundconsortia of community colleges(Green, 2017). These centers willhave the ability to speci ﬁcally train
personnel with cyber-expertise whointend to work directly in the worldof operational maritime industries.
An example of one school cur-
rently training students speci ﬁcally
in maritime cybersecurity is the Ste-vens Institute Maritime Security Cen-ter (Stevens Institute, 2018), whoseapproach includes summer courseswhere students can focus on cyber-security speci ﬁcally for port and ship-
ping operations. Stevens also has acontract for developing training mate-rials for use throughout the industryunder a contract from the ABS ’s
Cyber Security Project. Similarly, anew program at Texas A&M Uni-versity has recently been set up fortraining cybersecurity engineers, partof which is intended to focus on mar-itime cybersecurity (Texas A&MUniversity, 2018).
There remains the question of
whether and how universities can bestassist with developing cybersecuritysolutions (Eidam, 2017), but the Na-tional Science Foundation establishedFIGURE 3
Autonomous systems, including underwater vessels, surface vessels, and unmanned aircraft,
are coming into use for port and harbor security, and commercial shipping with unmannedvessels is already being developed and tested. Communications between all these systems re-
quire cybersecurity assurance.
50 Marine Technology Society Journala Center for Trustworthy Scienti ﬁc
Infrastructure in 2016, as well asCybersecurity Centers of Excellence(NSF, 2016, 2017), to assist withthis effort. Moreover, NSF also listedquantum technologies as one of theirtop 10 focus areas for the future
(Cordova, 2017). As there have
been rapid technology advances inthis area, it is not just possible, butalso likely, that there will be an in-tersection between improved secu-rity and quantum technologies inthe near future.
Quantum Components
of Cybersecurityin the Future
Currently, encryption methods
used are not based on quantum en-cryption methods but are susceptibleto decryption using quantum com-puting methods. As quantum encryp-tion methods are developed anddeployed, as an interim step, thereare methods being proposed that
will make existing encryption
methods less susceptible or hopefullyresistant to hacking using quantummethods (Mandelbaum, 2018). Vari-ous algorithms have been developed,a n ds o m eo ft h e mh a v ep r o v e ns u s -ceptible to quantum hacking. Onenew method, termed a “modi ﬁed
knapsack ”approach (Hamlin, 2017),
has been developed and is now beingtested to see if it can stand up toquantum hacks.
The use of quantum computing
was until recently considered a fairlyabstract and remote possibility, re-quiring highly specialized equipmenta n dt r a i n i n g .T h e r ea r eaf e wl a r g eD-Wave quantum computers in the
United States with a 512-qbit capacity
(Thompson, 2014), but it has notbeen easy for most graduate students
or researchers to either learn to codefor them or have the kind of accessthat would develop expertise in theiruse. However, the international pushtoward quantum computing haschanged this picture more rapidly
than many people realize. Currently,
the United States still holds the inter-national lead in quantum technologiespatents, dominated by patents fromIBM, but China and other countrieshave very rapidly increased their out-put of patents in this area (Brachmann,2017). IBM has now made access totheir 5-qbit quantum computer, calledQ, freely accessible over the Internet( I B M ,2 0 1 8 ) .T h e ya l s oc o n t i n u et omanufacture chips with higher num-bers of qbits, which are being madeavailable to advanced researchers. Inaddition to now having access to quan-tum computers, the recent develop-ment of quantum programminglanguages, such as Quil, and instruc-
tional manuals on how to use them
(Smith et al., 2017) will broaden thebase of users familiar with quantumcomputing technologies. There isnow even a free online 1-qbit comput-er available to test software instructionsbefore running the code on a largerquantum system (Geils, 2017). Noris IBM alone in developing quantumcomputing technologies; naturally,Microsoft has entered the ﬁeld as
well, using a somewhat different ap-proach (Bright, 2017), as have Intel,Google, and others (Corneliussen,2018). However, what many thinkmay really broaden the availability ofquantum computing was the develop-ment of new methods of building
quantum computer chips that do not
require them to be supercooled andcan take advantage of chip manu-facturing technologies similar tot h o s ea l r e a d yi nu s eb yt h ei n d u s t r y(Wagstaff, 2017). One can expect
that development of this technol-ogy will be the subject of intensefocus, with potential for major changesin computing methods in the nearfuture.
Apart from simply using quantum
c o m p u t e r sa sam e a n so fi n c r e a s i n g
the capability and security of comput-ing systems, quantum methods canalso be used to change the way com-munications are done in the ﬁrst
place. Technologies have been suc-cessfully developed that allow en-tangled photons to be generated oneven small communication satellites(cf. Tang et al., 2016). Using thesetechnologies, China has installedﬁber optic cables with quantum en-
cryption between several of theirmajor cities and also demonstratedfree-space quantum communicationsvia satellite that have been found tobe unhackable (Courtland, 2016;Nordrum, 2017; Spender, 2017).
While the U.S. Navy has continued
to push for new methods of opticalcommunications between aircraftand submarines (Keller, 2017a), itmay soon be the case that quantumcommunications provide a viable alter-native with improved security as well(Anonymous, 2018b; Gerginov et al.,2017). While there is an existing bodyof literature outlining methods forquantum (and “postquantum ”)c r y p -
tography (cf. Bernstein et al., 2009),some have continued to question thepracticality of quantum cryptography(Jackson, 2013). However, with theChinese demonstrations, now thequestion is not whether quantumcryptography is a good idea but, in-
stead, how it should best be developed
not just for connected computersbut also to network manned andunmanned systems in the real world(Sasaki, 2017). The inevitability of
September/October 2018 Volume 52 Number 5 51this approach is re ﬂected in a draft mes-
sage to the President by the NationalSecurity Telecommunications Advi-sory Committee (NSTAC) in 2017,which noted that “the government
should consider the impact of quan-tum computing not just on military
or intelligence agencies, but also on
critical commercial functions …and
develop a plan for implementingquantum-resistant encryption schemes ”
(NSTAC, 2017). The bene ﬁts of un-
hackable quantum cryptography areobvious (cf. Herman, 2017).
Summary and Conclusions
With the integration of new navi-
gation systems onto 1,800 CoastGuard vessels (Keller, 2014), navalvessels, and an ever-increasing num-ber of commercial ships, there willsoon be more than 200,000 vesselsnow believed at cyber-risk (NavalDome, 2017a). Therefore, improve-ments in maritime security are needed.These include improved cybersecuritywithin shore-based and port opera-
tions, onboard ships, and among at-
sea communication paths via satellites(Ingols et al., 2017). For federal mari-time agencies in the United States,maintaining currency on cybersecuritybest practices can be improved by par-ticipation in annual NIST Cyber-security Workshops speci ﬁcally for
federal cybersecurity personnel. Simi-lar NIST workshops are likewise heldfor industry partners. However, whilemethod of cybersecurity protocolswill continue to evolve, in general,cybersecurity methods used will besimilar to those in the past and will re-quire continuous software patch up-grades and analytics as cyber-systemsmove toward implementing auto-
mated real-time anomaly detection
and response capabilities. However,in the not distant future, many of the
problems with the inevitable unpro-
tected cybersecurity “weak links ”
found in using these traditional ap-proaches could be eliminated with atransition to quantum encryptionand quantum communications. Tech-nologically, that day may come soonerthan many people think, recalling that,
a decade ago, the current cell phone
technology was essentially unimagin-able. However, as new cybersecurityand communication methods arise,they will still require dissemination ofknowledge of standards, protocols, and
maritime cybersecurity expertise that
will require broad awareness through-out the industry and a strong programfor training maritime cyber-experts.While NIST Cybersecurity Work-shops and online resource materialswill help those willing and able to
access them, to help improve both
national and international cybersecu-rity in the maritime arena, the MarineTechnology Society (MTS) has starteda Maritime Cybersecurity and Infra-structure Committee, which has its
goals of (1) providing a forum for the
development and exchange of mari-time cybersecurity ideas, information,and experiences; (2) advancing aware-ness of cyber-risk; (3) promulgatingbest practices to drive organizational
cyber-resiliency; and (4) coordinating
and disseminating standards, trainingdocuments, guidelines, and maritimecybersecurity resources through its
webpage and MTS meetings. Informa-tion on the committee can be foundat https://www.mtsociety.org/
communities/procommittees/maritime-
cybersecurity-and-infra.aspx andalso at http://www.garibaldisrock.com/MCSIC/. As a re ﬂection of
community awareness of the need forincreased maritime cybersecurity, theMTS Cybersecurity Committee isone source of information to assist
with addressing this need.
