1. INTRODUCTION  
The rapid of the online business transaction is a t rigger by the traditional companies to switch 
their business in the online sales transaction that  can serve their customers in 24 hours a day, 
seven days a week and 365 days in a year. The compa nies focus on increasing sales and shaping 
the public's awareness of their business. The study  by [1] indicates that 49 million households 
will spend $ 184 billion in shopping online. Howeve r, behind the success in shopping online, 
there are the potential dangers associated with the  virus attack "Worm" who attacked the 
Impact of Cybercrime In E-Business and Trust  
http://www.iaeme.com/IJCIET/index.asp 653 editor@ia eme.com internet network time. The company realized that sh opping in traditionally required the 
customers to visit, and the company tried to influe nce them to switch in shopping online.  
The aim is the customers can use their shopping tim e for other activities. Unfortunately, 
there is among consumers are distrust to transact i n shopping online, the physical goods cannot 
be touch, as a form of their shopping habits [13]-[ 17]. Another reason is the customer's 
perception that there is ineffectiveness in the sec urity of the online transaction.  However, the 
opinion that crime in the virtual world in which th e transaction data is easily misused [2], [13]-
[17]. Many companies were attempting to protect the ir e-business using the sophisticated 
information technology. It was done solely to prote ct the discount rates and improve customer 
confidence is considered low. Cybercrimes are not o nly can attack the site shopping online even  
[3], [17] also reveals there is the threat of cyber crimes in which could attack the state's security. 
2. LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.1. The Adoption of The Development Model For Cons umers 
Conceptually, cybercrimes caused by three things na mely fraud online, privacy violations, and 
use the information without permission. The risks a re often experienced by consumers who 
shop online including credit card fraud or receive their products are not by request. This case 
as evidence that can give a negative effect on the attitude of consumers in shopping online [4]. 
Online sales can be increased when the company can minimize even eliminate all the risk of 
the transaction and its impact on the consumers who  feel secure, comfortable and free in 
shopping online such as occurred on shopping offlin e [4], [13]-[17]. 
Therefore, it concludes that security in the virtua l world will affect the consumers' attitude 
in the online shop. On the contrary, if the virtual  security world cannot provide the security 
guarantee in shopping online, it would affect the c ustomers' perception. It shows that the 
development of informatics technology and policy al so affects the customer perception. A 
scholar such as Vroom V.H. stated that human action  based on the perception, attitudes, and 
beliefs. Also, human tendency chooses pleasure and to avoid trouble [5]. 
2.2. The Companies Motive to Improve The Security i n The Virtual World. 
Why a company dares invest on a large scale with re liable human resources as a manifestation 
of the security development in the online transact?  The aim is to expand the market share with 
online sales, to improve merchantability, marketing  research, and to improve the reputation of 
the company credibility in the consumers' mind. Bus iness does not only emphasize to reach the 
customers to visit their website, but it also to ga ther information and maintain to their consumers 
are willing to revisit and repurchase [13]-[17]. 
2.3. Develop a Sense of Trust 
Business analysts are optimistic about the developm ent of the online site in the future if it is 
seen from the online purchase by consumers (B2C) an d business to business (B2B). However, 
there is often by the components of the online busi ness ignore to maintain their customers. That 
is not the internet business development only, but the company has to be paid attention to the 
existing customers is something important  [6]. Man y companies on the Internet were 
attempting to attract new customers rather than try ing to maintain their customers. It is due to 
the cost is cheaper and easy to calculate the volum e of new sales in measuring the sales to the 
customer loyalty. Implementation of the integration  concept is essential in building consumer 
confidence.  
Integration is a significant technical issue to mai ntain the customers' trust. Integration is the 
most important concept for the online market which is developing many benefits for the Nashrudin Setiawan, Vita Cita Emia Tarigan, Pipit B uana Sari, Yossie Rossanty, Muhammad Dharma

services, the location of the nearest store and oth er related information. Moreover, it makes 
easier for consumers to see the product on the inte rnet before visiting the nearest store. Time 
also as the consumers' consideration because they d o not need to go to the store and they already 
know the product prices through the company's websi te [13]-[17]. That has been the 
development of the strategy by using the internet s ite such as Information Technology, website 
design as an asset was not exist in the future. The  unsubstantial asset is significant due to the 
organization's culture, human resources that have a  competency, featured products. They will 
create the customers' loyalty, and they do not use pirated or imitate products made by the 
competition with the technological support. 
2.4. The Impact of Cybercriminals on Consumer Purch asing Patterns 
For the traditional buyers indicate three different  impacts cybercrime in online purchase 
behavior. Cybercrimes have the potential to reduce the value of the internet information, 
possibility to repurchase in online tend to become the consumers' marketing channels. The 
research conducted by Gartner Group found the onlin e security issues including risk online 
purchase is due to a lack of understanding of the d eception on the Internet that can be through 
contact on a personal level as well as social media  [7]. Many companies do not only protect the 
security system in the form of customers and the co mpany's information. There are several ways 
to protect customers and companies: 
• Do the identification or genuine techniques; the me thod uses the data transmission to 
complement the authenticity from an account, it wil l make changes. 
• Do encryption data information; Encryption data as to how the original to protect the critical 
information that is transmitted through the open ne twork. 
• Create an application cookie; Cookies file is a com puter that is placed on the customer's 
computer during the visit the website. And made as two lines of communication between the 
PC and PC users to know the authenticity of the use r. 
2.5. Government Regulation 
Internet users must agree to personal security as a n essential issue. The scholars found that 
many internet users used the internet in one electr onic device. It is worrying if the personal 
information related to the spread of data and trans action. [6]-[9]. Consumers trust is not only 
related to the regulation, but they related to the retailers' credibility. A good name is a behavior 
that can be trusted and as an essential role to det ermine an individual's desire to enter a change 
as easier that accepted by the other party [13]-[17 ]. The unaware of a virtual world is a problem 
for the active companies participate, hundreds of s ervice provider, thousands of technicians and 
millions of individual user [10], [13]-[17]. 
3. CONCLUSION 
The growth of potential sales in cyberspace is the reason for increasing attention to cyber crime. 
Consumers should seek more information regarding on line shopping issues in the virtual world 
and the risks associated with expectations that are  not in line with reality. Companies must 
increase the trust of customers by creating securit y systems in cyberspace. The security system 
is not only for companies, but also to protect cons umer information.
