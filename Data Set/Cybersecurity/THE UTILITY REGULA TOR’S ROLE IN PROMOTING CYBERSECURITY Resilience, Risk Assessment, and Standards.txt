Executive Summary  
 
Since 2016 , the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) ’s Bureau for Europe and 
Eurasia  has taken a leadership position in promoting regulatory and utility preparedness of cybersecurity 
in defense of critical infrastructure.  Through work in Eastern Europe and Eurasia, USAID and NARUC 
have provided technical information and trainings to promote the capacity  of energy regulators to play a 
leading role in protecting and advancing the energy sectors of their countries.   
 
This guide was initially developed for regulators in Europe and Eurasia  to reinforce their knowledge of 
practical cybersecurity solutions in the face of ongoing threats within the energy sector . 3 However, the 
questions of how to evaluat e risks, assess mitigation measures , and select standards are relevant for 
regulators around the world.   
 
NARUC’s intention in preparing this guide is to provide a consolidated review of multiple cyber concepts 
that can serve as a nontechnical and user -friendly guide to energy regulatory staff.   Regulators are charged 
with several core functions, such as ensuring security of supply, evaluating utility investment plans, and 
setting tariffs.  As cyber threats continue to evolve, energy regulators need to increase their technical 
capacities to be able to serve as leaders within their countries and promote  coordination among 
governmental and non -governmental institutions.  This guide provides a useful summary of international 
cyber standards (with more detai led information included in the annex) so that regulators can  have a 
starting point to more  easily evaluate options for their national and /or regional contexts.   
 
This guide addresses:  
1. Cybersecurity resilience  
2. Security by design  
3. The difference between inf ormation technology (IT) and operations technology (OT)  environments  
4. Risk assessments  
5. Standards to consider when developing regulations and frameworks  
 
This guide is sequenced to help energy regulators understand core cyber principles so they can develop 
and implement appropriate, country -specific regulatory structures and mechanisms.  The principles are 
essential building blocks to assist stakeholders to adapt to a constantly changing cyber threat environment 
and evolving technologies. There are myriad  standards already in existence , so regulators and utilities 
should draw from those, analyze lessons learned, and customize their structures and mechanisms to their 
own contexts.  
 
While it may seem a daunting task to figure out where to begin, regulators should start with the What  as 
a basis. Some standards are focused on high -level organizational security requirements and more detailed 
                                                           
3 USAID’s Europe and Eurasia Bureau began to focus heavily on cybersecurity after the 2015 Ukrainian power grid cyberatta ck. 
Through NARUC and the United States Energy Association (USEA), USAID is addressing cyber threats at both the 
regulatory and utility levels in the region.

recommended controls ( What ), whereas other sta ndards focus on the technologies that can be used to 
supply these cybersecurity controls ( How).  
 
The attached annex outline s some key existing cybersecurity standards and best practices organized by 
type ( What  and How) and the process es to take to move  towards compliance.  NARUC believes that the 
annex serves as a useful resource tool for regulators and other decision makers to evaluate the myriad of 
standards that have already been created.  These can be considered as starting points and can then be 
adapted to local contexts .  
 
Regulators should also engage in continuous education and capacity building efforts, sharing information , 
and drawing upon lessons learned. Just a few of the key recommendations that are addressed in this guide 
include:   
• Non-prescriptive standards . The standards that outline what must be achieved, not how to 
specifically achieve it, will provide entities the flexibility to build and maintain program s that work 
for them.  
• Drive the development of standards . Standards creat ed by the industry and for the industry 
are necessary for complex operational environments like an electric system. However, in certain 
circumstances, the regulator will need to step in to drive progress through issuance of mandatory 
standards.  
• High, mediu m, and low requirement applicability . This ensures prudent controls based on 
risk to the electric system.  
In conclusion, regulators and utilities must consider organizational reform  (corporate culture) first 
and foremost. The What standards target the hig h-level organizational structure and targeted controls, 
which is at the core of cybersecurity preparedness.

1 Introduction  
What is the regulator’s role regarding cybersecurity and cyber resilience? Should utilities be left to establish 
their own approach es, or should regulators take the lead to establish cybersecurity and resilience 
recommendations and/or requirements to assure a secure electrical grid? If the latter, what should 
cybersecurity and resilience regulations look like? Further, should economic re gulators intervene in the 
technical details of the grid without having a clear mandate for this? This guide is a resource to help 
regulators navigate the decision -making process as it pertains to cybersecurity and direct their priorities 
accordingly.  
At a minimum, energy regulators have clear mandates to ensure the quality of supply of energy. Whether 
a blackout is short or long, or occurs from a man -made intervention or a natural cause (i.e., weather), the 
public wants power restored as quickly as possibl e. Regulators also review and/or approve rate filings from 
the utilities. They must balance fair and reasonable rates with utilities’ needs for investment. As utilities 
make investments to increase cyber protection and/or manage recovery after a cyber incu rsion, the 
regulators must assess the prudency of these investments .4  
As energy regulators around the world increasingly embrace their roles and the associated challenges of 
managing cybersecurity, they continue to recognize increasing responsibilities. R egulators should develop 
their capacities to contribute to the development of  necessary frameworks, including cyber standards and 
consistent implementation of those standards. Regulators can organize the appropriate governance and 
enforcement structure s to ensure that cyber standards are implemented appropriately.5     
With this in mind, cybersecurity and resilience against cyberattacks are vital requirements for any business, 
particularly those responsible for critical infrastructure. Power system operator s must continue to manage 
a rapidly evolving electrical grid  and ensure relia bility and improved quality of service. However, utility 
operations are becoming increasingly complicated as they also tackle new market structures, rapidly 
evolving technologies,  and government societal goals (such as increased access and affordability).  
It is important to note that , when all stakeholders recognize the importance of cybersecurity preparedness, 
a voluntary approach to standards and risk assessment can be used, whi ch promotes strong cooperation. 
However, if any of the parties involved in safeguarding critical infrastructure, such as power systems, fail to 
adhere to the agreed -upon objectives and roles under a voluntary approach, then a mandatory approach 
may become necessary. There is an additional level of assurance with a mandatory approach because 
utilities can feel confident that there will be a provision for cost  recovery  by following set standards . 
Regulators also may find it easier to audit the utility for ado ption and implementation of mandatory 
standards. The information in this paper is for regulators who are being asked to address the cybersecurity 
                                                           
4 See also Ragazzi et al.,  Evaluating the Prudency  of Cybersecurity Investments: Guidelines for En ergy Regulators .  
5 This is not intended to downplay  the critical importance of utilities in the development and implementation of th ese 
framework s. As this guide will show, utilities will want to engage with regulatory commissions during this process to e nsure 
that their interests are protected and understood by the stakeholders involved. Utilities and regulators will need to embark 
on this important journey together , and to begin an important dialogue that addresses these complex issues.   
Historically, commissions and utilities in some partnering countries in the region have remained siloed due to the political 
environment. It is, however, imperative that this tradition begin to evolve as the issues become more complex in this 
dynamic envir onment. The advancement of technology, the integration of supply, and the threat of cyber attacks means that 
both parties will need to combine their expertise to appropriately strategize and communicate best practices. Regulators 
will need to ensure that a n environment of collaboration exists with utilities and that each party is met with mutual respect 
and understanding of their shared goals.

issues of utilities and other businesses to minimize the likelihood of cyberattacks and , in particular, the 
impacts of “successful” cyberattacks.   
These concepts provide the framework for implementing a strong cybersecurity environment and provide 
the business case for how standards can meet cyber resilience needs.  
 
2 Critical Concepts on Cybersecurity and Resilie nce for 
Regulators  
As a start, it is vital that regulators, as well as utilities, understand the five critical cybersecurity and 
resilience concepts discussed in -depth in the following sections:   
 
Five Critical Concepts on Cybersecurity and Resilience  
Concept #1: Resilience is the strategy for ensuring business continuity  
Concept #2: Security by design is the most cost -effective approach to security   
Concept #3: IT and OT are similar but different  
Concept #4: Risk assessment, risk mitigation, and continuous updates of processes and 
incident notification are fundamental to improving security  
Concept #5: Cybersecurity standards and best practice guidelines for OT environments 
should be used to establish security programs and policies  
 
2.1 Cyber Resilience as the Overall Strategy for Ensuring Security of Supply   
Cybersecurity is far more than preventing attacks by malicious hackers. The modern perspective on 
cybersecurity also entails improving the resilience of the power system by mitigating thr eats from security 
incidents that affect cyber assets and could disrupt operations.6 Specifically, the concept of cyber resilience 
calls for plans for ensuring safety and reliability before incidents (identify and prevent), during incidents 
(detect and respond), and after incidents (recover).7 
The m itigation of threats to resilience combines cybersecurity techniques (such as access control, detection 
of anomalous behavior, and incident logging) with organizational and engineering strategies, which allow 
the organization to prepare for and adapt to changing conditions and to withstand , and recover rapidly 
                                                           
6 A cyber asset is any equipment with computer processing capability, including controllers of hardware assets , but not the 
hardware assets themselves (e.g. , an electromechanical breaker).  Cyber assets can be affected by physical actions (cut ting a 
wire, damag ing a transformer) , as well as cyber actions (introduc ing malware, inadvertently enter ing incorrect data).  
7 Note that the US National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure 
Cybersecurity  (Cybersecurity Framework) is one of many internationally recognized frameworks and serves as an example 
that has proven su ccessful for many regulators and energy stakeholders.  See NIST, Framework .

from, disruptions. These engineering strategies include traditional power system reliability measures, such 
as redundant equipment, contingency analysis, an d backup systems. They should be augmented to address 
cyber asset vulnerabilities, such as planning for the loss of multiple assets, utilizing isolation capabilities to 
limit cascading effects or attacks, and even training personnel in manual operation pro cedures for 
emergency situations when an automated system is down or needs to be disabled.  
Since human errors and misconfigurations are the most common cybersecurity events, checks on data 
entry or control commands should be included in resilience support . Because persons with detailed 
knowledge of power system operations are the most dangerous attackers, additional engineering strategies 
may need to be deployed to mitigate threat s from this type of attacker , such as two -factor authentication 
and continuou s monitoring of networks for anomalous traffic. In addition, storms can affect not only the 
power system, but its cyber assets. Therefore, backup generators, communication networks, and spare 
cyber equipment should be located in secure sites, yet easily ac cessible when needed.  
Regulators have an additional consideration when guiding utilities on cybersecurity, and they can take 
advantage of existing standards and lessons learned. For example, the use of a cybersecurity framework 
(e.g., the NIST Cybersecurit y Framework) may be a valid option. A cybersecurity framework can provide 
a template for establishing organized security policies for preventing cyberattacks as well as provide 
guidelines for planning preparedness efforts following the inevitable successfu l cyberattack or security 
incident that affects assets. Regulators could suggest that utilities use one such cybersecurity framework 
to organize their approaches to developing their cybersecurity plans .  For example, a summary of key 
concepts from the Nati onal Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) includes the following : 
 Identify assets, threats, vulnerabilities, and potential impacts from a security incident.  
 Protect information assets through configuration design, access control, personnel procedur es, 
personnel security training, and appropriate technologies.  
 Detect security incidents through continuous monitoring and event detection, as well as assess 
the severity of security incidents.  
 Respond to security incidents, in collaboration with national computer security incident response 
teams (CSIRTs), to mitigate the impacts  of incidents  through prior planning and the application of 
mitigation procedures and technologies.  
 Recover from security incidents by planning, improving, and reassessing threats a nd vulnerabilities.  
2.2 Security by Design as the Most Cost -Effective Approach  
The cost of cybercrime continues to increase each year. In a single day there are about 780,000 data 
records that are lost due to security breaches, 33,000 new phishing messages, an d 4,000 ransomware 
attacks globally.8 Analysts estimate the total 2019 cost of cybercrime at $2 trillion, which is a fourfold 
increase from 2015.9 
With this in mind, designing security into cyber systems from the beginning  is the most cost -effective 
approa ch to cybersecurity, since it minimizes risk and financial expenditures. Security by design permits

more consistency across all systems with well -defined configurations of networks and information flows. 
Users will have consistent procedures to follow, rat her than ad hoc security approaches.  
Effective security cannot just be patched on to existing power system operational processes, but should 
be an intrinsic part of system designs and configurations, operational procedures, and information 
technologies. I nserting security procedures and technologies after  initial system design  is also costly 
because such insertions  are often ad hoc and require major modifications to system configurations as well 
as significant retraining of personnel. If designed from the beginning, security becomes a normal part of the 
life cycles of power system cyber assets and operational procedures.  
The term security by design  covers many aspects,10 such as system configurations, network configurations, 
planning procedures, and data man agement. Many of the benefits of security by design can be realized even 
if systems are just being upgraded or slowly replaced, since having a well -thought -out plan is effective  for 
including security at each upgrade or replacement step.  
Some of the aspects of security  by 
design involve  becoming aware of 
potential threats and vulnerabil ities 
before finalizing system and network 
configurations. For example, if the most 
critical systems can be located within a 
well-defined electronic security zone , 
also known as an electronic security 
perimeter, access to these critical 
systems can be desi gned to be limited, 
protected, and carefully monitored (see 
Figure 1). Such a design reduces “attack 
surfaces” that could be exploited by malicious entities or simply misused by accident.  
Security by design can improve possible security mitigation actions , since planning for the inevitable 
successful security breach es (failure scenarios) leads to training and contingency actions and the 
development of strategies to mitigate these potential breaches. Further, in security by design scenarios, 
access control can be implemented down to the data levels, not just to the system l evels, which allows 
true end -to-end security between users and their access to data, thus limiting very precisely who can 
monitor and/or control what data. The same access control can also be applied to the data flows between 
software applications.  
Flows of valid information to the right place s within the right time s are the most critical requirements for 
operational environments. Security by design can ensure that this level of assurance is provided by secure 
                                                           
10 Security by design is a concept created to address how to protect the core pillars of information security , confidentiality, 
integrity, and availability. The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) created a comprehensive list of security 
by design principles that cyber professionals should adhere to. Following OWASP’s principles can assist utilities in s ecuring 
and drastically reducing the risk of successful cyberattacks. See OWASP Foundation, “Security by Design.”  
Examples of the s ecurity by d esign principles  include : (1) minimize attack surface area, (2) establish secure defaults, (3) apply 
the principl e of least privilege, (4) fail securely, (5) do not trust services, (6) apply separation of duties, (7) avoid security by 
obscurity, (8) keep security simple, (9) fix security issues correctly, and (10) apply defense -in-depth  principles .  
These principles are considerations that require their own detailed analysis , but for  the purposes of this paper are listed for 
informational purposes  only.

protocols natively supported by systems as part of the core capabilities of the systems. For example, 
validating information can help mitigate the threat of persons who have the knowledge to disrupt power 
system operations by ensuring that data verification is engineered within each system. At the sam e time, 
access to data may be constrained due to security policy requirements.  
Security policies established during the design of systems can mandate procedures for purchasing and 
updating systems. With such security policies, the configurations of communi cation networks can be 
carefully designed, and the security of the supply chain can be better known and managed.  
Nonetheless, it is well recognized that security cannot be designed quickly for existing systems, particularly 
since power system components ma y have vastly different life cycles. Therefore, it is crucial that , even for 
existing systems, security should be designed into operational procedures and should provide a well -
defined methodology for system upgrades.  
Regulators can communicate with utilit ies to develop a security by design approach to cybersecurity, 
including the transitions of legacy equipment to more secure equipment. Regulators could recommend 
that utilities identify security by design principles they are or will be implementing. For in stance, regulators 
can request information on:  
 Utility security policy for operations, covering overall security organization and procedures.  
 Roles that personnel will be assigned (e.g., system operator, maintenance personnel, protection 
engineer, security  engineer) and their responsibilities, privileges, and constraints (least privilege and 
separation of duties).  
 Techniques for ensuring that role -based access control strictly enforces those privileges and 
constraints.  
 Personnel security vetting and trainin g procedures.  
 Operational system configurations, including electronic security perimeters, access points, and 
technologies for security flows of information across perimeters.  
 Plans for logging, assessing, and reporting different levels of security inciden ts. 
 Plans for operating the power system after different types of incidents (e.g., equipment failures, 
personnel mistakes, natural disasters, and cyberattacks).  
 Plans for recovering from security incidents.  
Depending on the situation in each country, this security by design may include voluntary standards or may 
need a stronger framework to add clarity and confidence by enacting mandatory standards.  
2.3 IT vs. OT: Differing Security Requirements in the Informatio n Technology and 
Operational Technology Environments  
In traditional business environments, the IT department is considered the expert in all matters related to 
cybersecurity. For most corporate cyber assets, the IT department is well placed to understand and address 
threats and to design methods to minimize vulnerabilities and respond to attacks. In general, since 
corporate cyber assets are mostly vulnerable to breaches of  the confidentiality of the information contained 
within computer systems, most IT se curity focuses on preventing access to sensitive data.   
 13 
However, in OT environments  such as power systems , deliberate cybersecurity incidents or inadvertent 
errors and failures of cyber assets can also have physical repercussions because power systems are c yber-
physical systems. The aspect with the greatest consequence s is safety; the deliberate or inadvertent mis -
operation of a cyber asset could cause equipment damage, personal harm, or even death. The second most 
important aspect is the reliability of the power system. Although power systems have always been built 
with the reliability of their physical assets (e.g., breakers, transformers, power lines) as the most critical 
design requirement, the reliability of the supporting cyber assets must nowadays also  be designed to the 
same degree.  
Therefore, for OT, as illustrated in Figure 2 , availability and data integrity are the most critical requirements 
(where sometimes availability is the most important, while at other times data integrity is paramount).11 
With their experience in reliability, it is often the experts in power system operations who best understand 
what responses to cyber asset incidents may or may not be appropriate and, combined with IT cyber 
expertise, how best to utilize engineering strategie s and operation of the physical electrical system to 
minimize the impacts of such cyber asset incidents.  
 
When securing operational 
environments, some very 
specific security challenges arise. 
For instance, the need for high 
availability of both physic al and 
cyber assets requires 
engineering designs with a focus 
on redundancy, high -reliability, 
and high -performance 
requirements of these assets. 
These security requirements 
may necessitate changes in 
network configurations and 
information flows, such as t he 
use of security perimeters, 
demilitarized zones, and firewalls. In addition, very high -speed real -time processes involving peer -to-peer 
interactions, autonomous actions, time sensitivity, and other characteristics, require different security 
solutions from those typically used in IT.  
At the same time, operational constraints must be taken into account in these designs. For instance, 
constraints on equipment resources (e.g., timing, bandwidth, network access) can impact the cybersecurity 
procedures and te chnologies that could be used. In particular, heavy encryption techniques or online access 
to certificate authorities are generally not possible for operational assets. In addition, the timing for system 
maintenance and equipment updates or upgrades is con strained by power system operational 
                                                           
11 Availability and data integrity and h ave been subject to a battle  over whether a vailability supersedes integrity . Certainly no 
one would continue to make a process 100  percent  available to an adversary . However,  in a situation  where the data 
integrity of a process cannot be ensured , the likely course of action includes moving off-line safely until it is possible to ga in 
ensure integrity  and val idate that the process was not being mis -operated. In reality, these two priorities must be quickly 
balanced and considered. This is noted in Figure 2 .

requirements, such as only having short windows during the spring or fall for taking equipment out of 
service.  
Another constraining element for applying cybersecurity reflects the large amount of legacy equipment 
with l ong life cycles that cannot be easily upgraded to include cybersecurity techniques. In addition, given 
the criticality of power system operations, security should not prevent operational actions. In particular, 
emergency actions and “break the glass” scena rios must be built into security procedures.  
Another major difference in securing an operational environment as opposed to a traditional business 
environment is the need to utilize Internet -of-Things (IoT) networks and technologies, in particular to 
intera ct with customer sites for monitoring and managing distributed energy resources (DER) and 
communicating with smart meters. This use of IoT implies that utilities can no longer rely on only their 
own proprietary communication networks, but  they must nonethe less still apply cybersecurity techniques 
to the ir interactions across public networks using well -known communication technologies.  
Regulators can suggest that utilities encourage their IT and OT groups to work closely together to develop 
an optimal and c oordinated approach to cybersecurity and resilience and to discuss any security 
requirements. In particular, as such a project evolves, these experts could jointly perform threat, 
vulnerability, and impact assessments to determine different types of risks and how best to utilize both 
cyber and power engineering methods and operations to minimize the impacts  of incidents . Such 
assessments would use the resilience and security -by-design approaches previously described, but would 
be sure to use the expertise o f both IT and power system experts.  
Other considerations include holistic approaches that will allow utilities to cultivate and promote cross -
functional knowledge o f IT and OT security. This includes promoting a cyber  culture through safety -culture 
and safety -hygiene courses; tailor -made trainings, security; and safety education through trainings, 
exchanges, and exercises. Regulators should consider these practices when assessing the compliance 
culture of utilities in a ddition to risk assessments.  
2.4 Risk Assessment, Risk Mitigation,12 and Life Cycle Processes and Incident 
Notification  
Risk assessment, risk mitigation, and life  cycle continuous update of processes and incident notification are 
fundamental to improving security. Using business requirements (financial, brand, operation, societal), 
derived from  methodologies defined in international standards for OT environments, or ganizations can 
determine security risk exposure.  
The strategy for risk mitigation must take into account operational constraints and integrate those of the 
OT networks. The constraints of OT networks often include the protection of physical assets  and personal 
safety, as well as constraints related to the performance and architecture of the networks. It is important 
to consider that , in the context of electric utilities, it is the energy processes that provide service to the 
end customer.  
                                                           
12 “Risk” can be  defined as a combination of the consequences that would foll ow from the occurrence of an unwanted event 
and the likelihood of the occurrence of the event. Risk assessment s are used to identify, estimate, and prioritize risk resulting 
from the operation and use of informational systems  to organizational operations , organizational assets, individuals, other 
organizations, and countries at a national level.   
Risk mitigation refers to actions aimed at systematic reduction of exposure to a risk (i.e. , targets , impact , severity).   
 15 
Some assets can  cost several million dollars and require more than a year to be replaced, so security 
measures to mitigate damage to these assets are very important. For the best risk mitigation solutions, 
integrat ing the professionals of these environments not as consul tants, but directly as part of the team in 
charge of cybersecurity , is key . This recommendation is valid for all departments or teams of a business 
such as telecommunications and OT engineers, since the vulnerability to an attack and the possible 
responses  to an attack will need to mobilize all skills to restore the system. The implementation of 
continuous improvements of security policies, procedures, and technologies become s vitally important 
during the continuous life cycle process. By conducting periodi c security reviews or test scenarios, utilities 
can better ensure that systems will be kept updated and new mitigation processes will be put in place.  
 
Figure 3 illustrates the general risk management 
process. The challenge is how to apply these 
concepts to develop a cybersecurity plan for the 
operational environment. No single process can 
meet all requ irements , but some general rules are 
useful on how, when, and for what purpose to apply 
these cybersecurity standards and guidelines to 
improve resilience and security of the OT 
environment.  
Regulators can encourage utilities to perform risk 
assessments t o understand the threats and 
vulnerabilities more clearly and to determine their 
possible risk mitigation options. These risk 
assessments can start by covering most operational 
processes, but then take a more focused look at 
specific areas of threats and v ulnerabilities over 
time.  
 
The following list details the key risk assessment steps:  
 Collect the high -level business and regulatory requirements that apply to the OT environment, and 
identify the impacts (safety, economics, operational) if the requirements are not met.  
 Choose a risk assessment method, based on organizational requirements and constraints.  
 Choose the scope of the risk assessment to be performed, based on the boundaries of the targeted 
systems, including not only the systems intern al to the boundaries, but also the interfaces with 
other OT and non -OT systems.  
 Understand that threats can be associated with physical equipment, information, processes, 
interactions, configurations, and other assets.

 16 
 Balance the risk against the mitigat ion costs of reducing that risk to an acceptable level. Internal 
security policies must determine the acceptable risks.13 Risk mitigation may involve an update to 
the risk assessment to ensure that the risks are indeed acceptable, particularly if many chang es have 
been made as part of risk mitigation.  
 Apply security controls to mitigate the risks that were identified.  
 Select and implement risk mitigation solutions across systems after completing the risk assessment.   
 Determine what actual control implementa tions (i.e., which specific procedures and/or 
technologies and/or commercial products) should be applied for each type of security control.  
 Monitor all control solutions over time to ensure continued effectiveness and to determine if 
possible attacks have potentially overcome the control solutions.  
2.5 Cybersecurity Standards and Best Practices for the Energy Industry  
Given the complexity of business processes and the wide variety of cyber assets used in the energy 
environment, no single cybersecurity standard can address all security requirements, security controls, 
resilience strategies, and technologies. Some standards and guidelines are focused on high -level 
organizational security requirements and more detailed recommended controls ( What ), whereas other 
standards focus on the technologies that can be used to supply these cybersecurity controls ( How).  
Although many additional documents are available from national or international organizations such as 
NIST, the International Electrotechnical  Commission (IEC), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics 
Engineers (IEEE), and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), Figure 4 outlines 
cybersecurity standards and best practices organized by type ( What  and How) and the process es needed 
to come into compliance.  
                                                           
13 The determination of risk tolerance is at the core of the challenge that utilities and regulators face. There are various risk 
assessment tools and maturity models that can be employed to help utilities quantify their risk tolerances and allow 
regulators sufficient information to provide ver ification.

The most relevant high -level “ What ” cybersecurity standards include:  
 ISO/IEC 27001 Security audit (general at information -system level)  
 ISO/IEC 27002 Further specifies controls defined in ISO/IEC 27001  
 ISO/IEC 27019 Focused specifica lly for industrial control systems (ICS)/supervisory control and 
data acquisition (SCADA) (OT)  
 NIST Cybersecurity Framework  
 NIST Interagency Report (NISTIR) 7628 Smart Grid Security Guidelines  
 NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIPs)  
 IEC 62443 -2-1, 2-2, 2-3, 2-4, and 4 -1 Security programs  
 IEC 62443 -3-3 System security requirements  
 IEC 62443 -4-2 Security for products  
 IEC 62351 -12 Resilience of the power system with DER  
 IEEE 1686 Security for substations  
The technical -level standards provide standardiz ed methods and technologies on “ How” these cyber assets 
could be made more secure and resilient. These standards include many internet standards, as well as the 
specific IEC 62351 security standards for different communication protocols, role -based access control, 
network and system monitoring, key management, logging, and deep packet inspection.  
Most of these standards have (or are planned to have) conformance testing and certification standards 
associated with them. These cybersecurity standards and guide lines are described in more detail in the 
Annex.  
Regulators could suggest that utilities select the security standards and guidelines that are the most 
pertinent for each of the levels of security assessments, security procedures, and security technologies .  
In particular, regulators could encourage a rigorous approach to using high -level cybersecurity standards 
to better ensure that security requirements are well understood and that security controls are applied 
appropriately across all areas. Regulators c ould also suggest that utilities review the technical -level 
standards to best determine which are appropriate to meet specific security requirements.  
Alternatively, it is beneficial for regulators to explore initiatives and guidelines that map security sta ndards 
from many different sources to provide a complete point of reference , thus ensuring all necessary security 
controls are considered.  
3 Cybersecurity Procedures That Regulators Can Recommend To 
Secure Utility Operations  
Below are preliminary steps , whil e the Annex  highlight s specific internationally recognized standards that 
can be considered for future regulatory implementation.   
 19 
3.1 Preliminary Steps  
Regulators can suggest some very preliminary steps to be taken by utilities even while they develop a more 
formal cybersecurity process. These include:  
 Become familiar with cybersecurity standards, including both international standards and any 
regional or national standards.  
 Develop an inventory of all cyber assets, including systems, networks, databases, intel ligent 
electronic devices, gateways, and any device with “intelligence.”  
 Determine what OT and IT areas /departments  have already implemented some type of 
cybersecurity measures, and which have not addressed cybersecurity at all. This includes the 
management of user accounts, control center systems, substation systems and equipment, and 
other areas.  
 Start monitoring th e status of key cyber assets with notifications or alarms. Even without a full risk 
assessment, just having visibility into the status of cyber assets can be very important.  
 Isolate the operations networks from the corporate networks, and certainly from th e Internet: use 
physical separation where possible, firewalls for all access points, and security perimeters around 
substations and control centers with access only through firewalls.  
Regulators may very well be at this stage as they implement cybersecurit y processes. It is important to 
note that these preliminary steps will involve strategic relationship building. It is encouraged that regulators 
develop the necessary relationships with stakeholders. These stakeholders include both external bodies 
(e.g., ministry staff, utility CEOs) and internal commission staff to provide support during this extensive 
process. The importance of cybersecurity and the large effort that will need to be made by regulators and 
utilities will require long -term support and a vis ion of maintaining secure systems. Once regulators and 
utilities can build and maintain a relationship to support implementation of cybersecurity standards, their 
efforts will have long -lasting effects.    
3.2 Risk Assessment Procedures  
Utilities have the impo rtant task of making power systems safe through risk assessments. Performing risk 
assessments can result in a number of outcomes, such as: (1) power system designs that include monitoring 
of these power system assets; (2) redundancy of certain equipment,  including  security fences around 
substations and other dangerous sites to isolate equipment from unauthorized access; and (3) clear 
operating rules for normal and emergency situations. The same type of risk assessment can be undertaken 
for cyber assets. While the energy regulator would not be privy to all details from a utility’s risk assessment 
due to confidentiality issues, the regulator should be briefed in such a way as to allow it to assess the 
preparedness of the utility and consider rate -recovery w ith respect to investment expenses.14 
                                                           
14 The Cybersecurity Evaluative Framework for Black Sea Regulators , published in 2017, was developed as part of a USAID/NARUC 
project as an easy-to-use tool for regulators to evaluate utilities’ cybersecurity preparedness. The framework was designed 
to provide a structured way for regulators to assess what level of cybersecurity preparedness utilities have reached and 
identify areas for improvement.  See NARUC, Evaluative Framework . 
The evaluative framework  recommend s that reg ulators take five ini tial steps and provides  107 sample questions drawn 
directly from cybersecurity interrogatories conducted by US regulators. The questions focus on 12 core cybersecurity  
 20 
Once some of the preliminary steps have been taken, a risk assessment process should ensue. This risk 
assessment process consists of the following key steps:  
 Collect the high -level business and regulatory requirements t hat apply to the OT environment, and 
identify the impacts (safety, economic, operational) if the requirements are not met. These high -
level requirements establish the most important conditions that both power systems and their 
supporting cyber assets must meet.  
– Establish internal security policies by determining what risks are acceptable and identifying the 
procedures and the catalog of controls to address unacceptable risks.  
 Establish the risk assessment process based on best practices and well -established  standards, using 
cyber frameworks (such as the ISO/IEC 27000 series) to ensure all types of risks are identified . 
– Conceptually, risk assessments identify the financial and other impacts for mitigating the risk, 
and then assess the balancing of that risk ( impact versus likelihood of event) against the 
mitigation costs for diminishing that risk.  
– However, practically, there are a number of methods for assessing risks that have been 
described in different standards or guidelines. Some methods are more quantit ative than others, 
but most still rely on the experience of power system and cybersecurity experts to identify the 
vulnerabilities, likely threats, possible impacts, and potential mitigating configurations, 
procedures, and/or technologies  relevant to their  systems .  
 Perform risk assessments on the areas of interest (e.g., for a particular project) using methods 
identified in risk assessment guidelines and based on the impacts from the business and regulatory 
requirements. The risk assessments must take into  account the scope of specific projects and also 
the project’s interfaces with other OT and non -OT systems.  
– Risk assessments can be done at different levels (e.g., for a whole substation or some devices 
in a substation, or for one small site or a large ge nerating plant).  
– Some risks, such as threats to the safety of personnel, may not have a  great financial impact, 
but would necessarily be rated as highly important.  
– Some other types of risk may not be important enough to apply any specific mitigations.  
– Most types of risks should be evaluated to balance the ir potential impact and likelihood against 
the cost of mitigations. Often, one mitigation can minimize the impacts of many risks, such as 
isolating control networks from corporate networks.  
 Determine what a ctual control solutions (i.e., which specific procedures and/or technologies or 
even products) could or should be applied for each type of risk:  
– For different environments, the control solutions could be different and could be based on 
different standards.  
– Some mitigations may be engineering strategies (e.g., redundant systems, data validity checking, 
physical isolation, or monitoring), whereas others may be cybersecurity methods (e.g., access 
control, firewalls, certificates, or encryption).  
                                                           
subject areas, and they are designed to elicit responses from utilities that will give r egulators enough information to gauge 
their overall level s of cybersecurity preparedness.   
 21 
– Constraints on these potential control solutions should be identified, given the different issues 
associated with different OT environments, such as different constraints in a substation 
environment (long times between opportunities  to patch systems) or a DER environment 
(unavailable knowledge of on -site security).  
 Start the process of applying the selected mitigation solutions that were determined during the risk 
assessment process:  
– It may not be possible to apply s ome typical or selected control solutions  to systems in specific 
projects as initially defined, particularly for legacy systems. For instance, legacy systems may not 
be capable of supporting specific control solutions, such as antivirus applications or secure 
patching procedures.  
– Therefore, alter nate methods may need to be redefined to take into account the differences in 
system and device capabilities for particular environment s and project s (These alternate 
methods may be offered by vendors or in -house groups that have experience with these 
different environments).  
– These alternate methods could be obtainable  because a vendor proposes to meet a particular 
risk level, not just provide a specified control solution.  
– Vendors may also be asked to integrate their systems with the utility -standard contr ol solutions.  
 Validate results after risk mitigation solutions have been implemented:  
– Verify, as the project progresses, that the applied mitigation solutions have been applied 
correctly and provide the expected mitigations.  
– Explain how these mitigation so lutions should be applied, as this is crucial to understanding how 
they are expected to work and how to evaluate the solutions for effectiveness.  
– Perform simulations to assess how well any mitigation solution may work.  
– Determine if the mitigation solutio ns have actually mitigated the risk adequately and perform 
another risk assessment, if necessary.  
– Include an assurance process, such as an audit, possibly by a different group.  
 Monitor, over time, all security procedures and technologies in the completed p roject to ensure 
that the mitigation solutions remain  effective and determine whether possible future technologies 
or attack vectors could potentially overcome the original mitigation solutions.  
– In all cases, possible security events identified by such monitoring should be sent to a central 
computer emergency response team (CERT) or CSIRT site.  
 Ensure that the central site is capable of filtering and assessing the importance of security events or 
sequences of security events.  
3.3 Eventual Move toward Security P rocedures and Standard Security Technologies  
This risk assessment process actually involves determining mitigation procedures and technologies. Ideally , 
these should ultimately be consistent with each other, but because legacy equipment cannot always 
accom modate new technologies and because standardized solutions are not yet available, such mitigation  
 22 
solutions often start as ad hoc or temporary measures. Over time, there should be movement toward 
consistent security procedures and standard security technol ogies.  
4 Conclusions  
Regulators will increasingly need to support the requirements of cybersecurity and resilience for energy 
businesses. In particular, regulators will need to encourage or require (depending on whether there are 
voluntary or mandatory stand ards) the top management of utilities to design comprehensive security 
policies, processes, procedures, and technologies that cover resilience, security by design, operational 
requirements, risk management, and the use of cybersecurity standards and guidel ines. Such security can 
only be effective if it is seen as critical by top management and is promulgated down to all levels. This 
security culture must permeate the entire organization, and may increasingly need to be driven by 
regulatory requirements and laws. 
Cybersecurity procedures should not be reinvented. Regulators can (and should) rely on existing 
cybersecurity standards and guidelines. When considering investments (and cost -recovery), utilities (and 
thus regulators) should focus on ensuring that a system is secure and resilient. Standards must be known 
and understood prior to being adopted and imposed and they should address organizational/governance 
aspects , including the financial impact of implementation of said standards.  
As with all aspects of cybersecurity, risk assessments, standards , and other mitigation measures need to 
continuously adapt. Those who engage in cyberattacks are able to evolve their methods much more quickly 
than regulations can evolve , so there needs to be some flexibility wit hin standards to address that issue. 
These standards are not static, and regulators and utilities must constantly reassess their situations and 
undertake new approaches to address security challenges.  
Regardless of which standards are used and whether they  are voluntary or mandatory, security and 
resilience by design will become a highly important focus for regulators to ensure that utilities provide 
affordable services with the level of quality that consumers deserve and expect. Strategies, policies, and 
systems need to be based on known best practices and open to future improvements reflecting evolving 
standards and technologies.  
The following Annex provide s regulators with additional information on several internationally  recognized 
cybersecurity standar ds. Regulators can evaluate existing options rather than reinvent new ones, and 
contextualize them to their own country -specific situations (e.g., voluntary vs mandatory).   
  
   
 23 
5 Annex: Cybersecurity Standards and Best Practices  
This annex outlines several key existing cybersecurity standards and best practices organized by type ( What 
and How ) and the processes to take to move towards compliance.  As regulators increase their knowledge 
and engage with utilities and other governmental institutions in coordina tion efforts to promote effect ive 
cybersecurity measures, they can build upon lessons learned and standards already in use.  Rather than 
trying to develop completely new standards, it makes more sense for regulators to champion customization 
of existing st andards that have already proven to be useful and implementable.   
It is important that regulators understand the core principles behind why standards may be necessary, the 
consideration of voluntary vs. mandatory in their context, and the steps that utili ties in their countries are 
(or are not) taking.  When regulators, utilities, and other key institutions develop collaborative working 
relationships, they can improve cybersecurity measures in their energy sectors, thus bolstering the security 
and resilien ce of the grid.   
This annex provides a summary of key aspects of the following frameworks:  
- Section A.1  NIST Cybersecurity Framework  
- Section A.2  ISO/EC 27000 Series  
- Section A.3  NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection Standards  
- Section A.4  NISTIR 7628 G uidelines for Smart Grid Cybersecurity  
- Section A.5  IEC 62443 Series for Industrial Automation15 
- Section A.6  IEC 62351 Cybersecurity Series for the Smart Grid16 
Just as there is no single “best” model for how to effectively regulate the energy sector, the cyb er 
frameworks featured below should be considered in the context of individual country goals and realities.  
The authors of the guide have prepared summaries of cybersecurity standards that they have in-depth 
experience with  in the hopes of conveying infor mation to help regulators take the next step in leading 
cybersecurity efforts in their countries.  
A.1 NIST Cybersecurity Framework17 
Using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is an important first step for cyber professionals when assessing 
and improving their cy ber environments. The framework is used internationally and provides a high -level 
taxonomy of cybersecurity outcomes and a methodology to assess and manage those outcomes. A wide 
range of businesses and organizations can use this methodology to be proactiv e about risk management 
and cybersecurity.

As shown in Figure 5, the NIST framework includes high -level 
functions to identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. The 
five functions are applicable to cybersecurity risk management 
and also to risk management writ large. The detailed categories 
address all of the specifi c cybersecurity goals of an organization , 
such as cyber, physical, personnel, with a focus on business 
outcomes.  
The subcategories provide an in -depth understanding of the 
Framework Core (Core). There are 108 subcategories, which 
are outcome -driven statem ents that provide considerations for 
creating or improving a cybersecurity program. Since the 
subcategories are not prescriptive on how to achieve those 
outcomes, it allows for risk -based implementation that is 
customized to an organization’s needs.  
As se en in Figure 6, the C ore is designed to be intuitive and to 
act as a translation layer to enable communication between 
multidisciplinary teams by using si mplistic and nontechnical 
language. There are three key parts : functions , categories , and subcategories .  
The NIST framework allows for an organization to have a common language and systematic methodology 
for managing cybersecurity risk. The Core includes activities to be incorporated in a cybersecurity program 
that can be tailored to meet any organization’s needs. The framework is designed to complement, not 
replace, an organization’s cybersecurity program and risk management processes. The framework helps  
guide key decision points about risk management activities through the various levels of an organization , 
from senior executives to the business and process level, as well as implementation and operations.

A.2 ISO/IEC 27000 Series18 
The ISO/IEC 27000 series covers a wide range of cybersecurity requirements (see Figure 7). These 
cybersecurity standards are focused on what cybersecurity  policies and procedures should be put in place 
at the enterprise level.  
For the smart grid, the most relevant are ISO/IEC 27001, ISO/IEC 27002, and ISO/IEC 27019. These 
standards identify the high -level organizational and procedural requirements for cyber security, including 
risk assessment requirements, personnel security processes, and information security. ISO/IEC 27001 is 
general for all types of organizations, whereas ISO/IEC 27002 covers industrial organizations. Additional 
requirements for energy org anizations are included in ISO/IEC 27019.

A.2.1  ISO/IEC 27001 family of standards  
ISO/IEC 27001 is a globally recognized standard providing requirements for the establishment of an 
information security management system (ISMS). The ISO desc ribes an ISMS as “a systematic approach to 
managing sensitive company information so that it remains secure. It includes people, processes and IT 
systems by applying a risk management process.”19 The standard describes how an organization must set 
its secur ity objectives and determine the risks that threaten these objectives. The organization can respond 
to the identified risks with a risk treatment plan. An important part of this plan is choosing appropriate 
controls from ISO/IEC 27002 and all ISO/IEC 27002  sector -specific standards.

 26 
The ISO /IEC 27001 family of standards has grown quickly over the past years, and now includes around 40 
standards. Figure 8 gives an overview of the most relevant of the ISO/IEC 27001 standards.  
ISO/IEC 27001 , with other standards in the 27001 family , also provides the framework for third -party 
audits and certification of an organization’s ISMS. Organizations can have their ISMS certified against 
ISO/IEC 27001 by independent certification bodies, which have to be accredited by a national accreditation 
body.  
The ISMS family of standards consists of interrelated standards, already published or under development, 
and contains a num ber of significant structural components. These components are focused on:  
 Standards describing ISMS requirements (ISO/IEC 27001).  
 Certification body requirements (ISO/IEC 27006) for those certifying conformity with ISO/IEC 
27001.  
 An additional requirement  framework for sector -specific implementations of the ISMS (ISO/IEC 
27009).  
Other documents provide guidance for various aspects of an ISMS implementation, addressing a generic 
process as well as sector -specific guidance.  
Relationships between the ISMS fam ily of standards are illustrated in Figure 8:

A.2.2  ISO/IEC 27002:201320 
ISO/IEC 27002 is a code of practice —a generic set of controls addressing information security control 
objectives to mitigate security risks impacting , for example , the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of 
information.  
ISO/IEC 27002 security controls are organized within the following main clauses:  
 Organization of information security  
 Human resource security  
 Asset management  
 Access control  
 Cryptography  
 Physical and environmental security  
 Operations security  
 Communications security  
 System acquisition, development , and maintenance  
 Supplier relationships  
 Information security incident management  
 Compliance  
A.2.3  ISO/IEC 27019:201721 
ISO/IEC 27019 provides guiding p rinciples based on ISO/IEC 27002 for information security management 
applied to process control systems as used in the energy utility industry. The aim of ISO/IEC 27019 is to 
extend the ISO/IEC 27000 set of standards to the domain of process control system s and automation 
technology. This allows the energy utility industry to implement a standardized ISMS in accordance with 
ISO/IEC 27001 that extends from the business level to the process -control level.  
The scope of ISO/IEC 27019 covers process control syst ems used by the energy utility industry for 
controlling and monitoring the generation, transmission, storage, and distribution of electric power, gas 
and heat in combination with the control of supporting processes. This includes, in particular, the follow ing 
systems, applications, and components:  
 The overall IT -supported central and distributed process control  and monitoring and automation 
technology, as well as IT systems used for their operation, such as programming and 
parameterization devices.  
 Digital controllers and automation components, such as control and field devices or programmable 
logic controllers (PLCs), including digital sensor and actuator elements.

 All further supporting IT systems used in the process control domain (e.g., for supplementary  data 
visualization tasks and for controlling, monitoring, data archiving, and documentation purposes).  
 The overall communications technology used in the process control domain (e.g., networks, 
telemetry, tele -control applications , and remote control techn ology).  
 Digital metering and measurement devices (e.g., for measuring energy consumption, generation or 
emission values).

A.3 NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection Standards22 
A.3.1  Background  
In the early days of NERC, participation  in North America  was voluntary and electric utilities that were 
operating assets within the larger complex bulk electric system were operationally incentivized to manage 
and maintain their assets in a way that contributed to overall system reliability. Under this voluntar y model, 
common operating practices, guidelines, and standards were created to ensure that various utilities 
performing reliability tasks could ensure that they were being performed at a level of acceptable utility 
practice. As electric system reliability events occurred , and new threats to critical infrastructure reliability 
continued to rise, there was an effort to establish a regulatory structure  in the form of the Energy Policy 
Act 2005, which declared the need for an Electric Reliability Organization ( ERO) with the responsibility 
and authority to develop and enforce standards to ensure the reliability of the bulk power system.   
The ERO for North America is NERC, and it has  been responsible for working with the NERC Regional 
Entities to ensure the relia bility standards have been implemented and enforced. Although the NERC CIP 
standards have existed for a decade and half, we will consider  the version s of NERC CIP that are in effect 
currently ( a combination of v ersions 5 and 6) , see Figure 9. 
 
 
                                                           
22 NERC, “CIP Standards.”   
 29

To provide  background and for the purposes of identifying some of the strengths of the NERC CIP 
standards, we will discuss some key items for consideration when examining this standards group.  
 
A.3.2  Standards Developed by the Industry for the Industry  
As with all NERC standards, the CIP standards were driven by the electric industry directly. In 2003, a 
number of asset owners and operators identified cybersecurity —or the lack of cybersecurity —as a 
considerable risk to the reliability of the electric sector. It was a risk that was only going to increase, as the 
adoption of cyber assets within industrial control system environments continued to rise in parallel with 
two other trends —increasing intercon nectedness and accessibility of OT systems, and an ever -increasing 
adversary interest in industrial control system sectors. For this reason, the electric utilities began the 
process of creating a cybersecurity standard for the industry.   
Although the process of creating a standard can be complicated and time -consuming, the important 
elements to note when considering undertaking such a process include: that the standards be written by a 
drafting team with representation from electric sector  stakeholders, that the drafting process be open and 
transparent to the public, that there can be numerous industry comment periods to consider modifications 
to the proposed standard, and , most importantly, the use of  industry ballots to approve or reject the 
standards in development. In this way, the individual organizations that will need to ultimately satisfy the 
requirements have a voice throughout the entire development process to ensure their concerns are heard 
or addressed.  
A.3.3  Focus on Cyber and Physica l Threats to Grid Reliability   
In 2009, a jointly commissioned report was released by the US Department of Energy that identified key 
threats to the electric sector. This report focused on high -impact, low -frequency (HILF) events that have 
 
 30 
a low frequency  of occurrence (meaning possibly never) but  that, were they to occur, would be so high -
impact that the industry needed to take action to manage the impact. One of the HILF scenarios identified 
was a coordinated cyber and physical attack against the electri c system. Many looked to the CIP Standards 
to be implemented in a manner that would reduce the immediate and long -term impact of this type of 
attack. Many individuals with some exposure to the CIP standards are aware that the standards’ 
requirements addres s cybersecurity needs. However, it should also be made clear that CIP -006 addresses 
physical security controls for bulk electric system cyber assets with in the scope of CIP and CIP -014 
addresses physical security protections of critical transmission facili ties.  
A.3.4  Requirements Applicable to Both Traditional IT Assets and OT Assets  
As mentioned in the previous section, the NERC CIP standards are multifaceted, in that the requirements 
address cyber and physical threats. It also needs to be pointed out that the  CIP standards are neither 
limited in scope to traditional IT assets nor to interconnection sharing devices. Rather, the requirements 
provide a fairly detailed list of tasks that must be performed on IT and OT assets that could impact the 
reliability of th e entire grid. The requirements ultimately shape what an electric utility must do, but they 
are not prescriptive as to how the requirements must be met. In this way, the utilities have flexibility in 
how they will comply and what approaches and technologie s they will pursue to satisfy the standards.  
A.3.5  Lessons Learned  
The CIP standards have been undergoing a continual process of improvement since they were adopted 
and any country or state considering the CIP standards should take advantage of the many years o f 
implementation -driven improvements that have occurred. The following list describes the strong points of 
the current versions of CIP:  
 
• Asset owners drive the development of standards . Standards created by the industry and 
for the industry are necessary f or complex operational environments like an electric system.  
• Financial enforcement capability . There needs to be an incentive for entities to take action.  
• Criteria -based facility determination for in -scope assets . A standard approach that 
attempts to implement all controls across all things will fail. Identifying the right facilities and the 
right cyber assets is essential for a successful program.  
• Systematic approach to asset grouping and requirement applicability . Applying a control 
to a single devic e will not always be possible . However , achieving a control on a system when 
required is an effective implementation approach.  
• High, medium , and low requirement applicability . This ensures prudent controls based on 
risk to the electric system.  
• Non-prescri ptive standards . The standards that outline “What”  must be achieved, not “How”  
to specifically achieve it, will provide entities the flexibility to build and maintain a program that 
works for them.   
 31 
Guidance to those choosing NERC CIP  – For those regulators  considering adoption or modification 
of the CIP standards to fit their particular needs, the following recommendations will help ensure successful 
implementation:  
 
• Identify who will be the national authority ( like the ERO  described above ). There will need  to be a 
governance structure in place that will manage the utility reviews and possible auditing of the 
standards.  
• Modify CIP -002-5.1a - Attachment 1 based on the specifics of your electric system to ensure the 
appropriate level of in -scope assets at the appropriate level of protection (high, medium, or low).23  
• Review/modify the NERC -defined terms used throughout the CIP Standards to ensure they are 
understood  by and effective for both regulators and utilities.   
• Focus on a staggered implementation approac h that addresses those control center assets with a 
wide area impact first. Develop a standards implementation plan that addresses highest -risk facilities 
first and has later adoption dates for lower -risk environments.  
• Pursue peer evaluations from utility to utility during standards -adoption safe -harbor periods. Allow 
peer utilities to evaluate each other’s programs in a manner that supports learning and 
improvement, prior to conducting a formal audit.  
• Educate auditors/evaluators that the stronger an organization’s internal controls program is, the 
more possible violations it will self -identify. This should not be considered a problem in itself and 
therefore the regulators should ensure appropriate incen tives are in place to encourage positive 
behavior.  
• CIP is a baseline set of requirements that are encouraged to be exceeded. Consider the 
requirements as the cost of doing business and encourage entities to exceed the requirements.  
• Err on the side of relia bility and security, not document -driven compliance. A program built on 
policies and plans only, without any actual cybersecurity elements, will not allow an entity to satisfy 
compliance requirements and will have no effect on cybersecurity.  
A.3.6  Core Four Ques tions  
The NERC CIP model provides four key guiding principles for national  regulators to follow in order to 
have effective standards in place.  
1) Define which critical infrastructure assets are in scope. Asset types are defined in CIP -
002 Requirement 1 and s pecific impact rating criteria are defined in Attachment 1. Attachment 1 
criteria thresholds will need to be modified based on the electric system specifics of a particular 
country or region.  
2) Identify what the appropriate requirements will be.  CIP-003 thro ugh CIP -014 provide the 
requirements for asset owners to implement and manage a controls program. As shown over 
the years of CIP implementations that occurred at thousands of sites throughout North America, 
                                                           
23 NERC, CIP-002-5.1a.  
 32 
there are a large number of organization s and con sultancies capable of designing solid CIP 
programs, along with full personnel -training and credentialing programs to ensure capable staff 
to maintain CIP programs.  
3) Establish how assessments of sufficient adherence will be performed.  Throughout the 
many yea rs of voluntary readiness evaluations, peer assessments, and formal Regional Entity 
audits there arose a common body of knowledge and formal training that can be leveraged , as 
well as a large consultancy workforce that is skilled in performing CIP audit wo rk. 
4) Identify who will enforce the regulation and through what methods.  This is the main 
component that is specific to each country or state and must be defined in a manner that will 
ensure successful implementation and appropriate levels of enforcement aut hority to incentivize 
adoption.  
A.4 NISTIR 7628 Guidelines for Smart Grid Cybersecurity  
A.4.1  NISTIR 7628 Cybersecurity Controls  
The NISTIR 7628 consists of guidelines intended primarily for addressing cybersecurity of smart grid 
systems and the constituent subsystems of hardware and software components. The NISTIR 7628 
guidelines are very similar in scope to the ISO/IEC 27019 stand ard, except these guidelines focus exclusively 
on the smart grid sector. They define approximately 300 high -level security controls, based on similar 
security controls in other NIST documents, including the NIST framework (see Figure 10).

A.4.2  NISTIR 7628 Cybersecurity Logical Reference Model  
The NISTIR 7628 guidelines also extend these cybersecurity controls beyond the general requirements. 
They describe  a high -level logical interface reference model that defines 22 logical interface categories. 
These logical interface categories are characterized by the communication requirements and constraints 
between systems within and across smart grid domains  and co ver: operations, market operations, back -
office systems, substations, customer sites, DER, and other field equipment. For each of these logical 
interface categories, the appropriate high -level security requirements are also identified and annotated. 
Figure 11 shows the Logical Reference Model (sometimes referred to as the Spaghetti Diagram) that 
illustrates the types of communication requirements and constra ints associated with the smart grid.

A.5 IEC 62443 Series for Industrial Automation24 
A.5.1  IEC 62443 Background  
The international industrial security standard IEC 62443 is a security requirements framework defined as 
a joint activity betwe en the IEC and the ISA99 committee. The standard specifies security for industrial 
automation and control systems (IACS) and covers both organizational and technical aspects of security. 
Although focused on industrial automation in general, most of the cyb ersecurity requirements also apply 
to the energy sector and include more details on specific operational and field equipment requirements for 
cyber -physical systems than the ISO/IEC 27000 series alone. For instance, it details requirements for patch 
manage ment and poses specific security requirements for systems or components to cope with a specific 
security level. Of particular pertinence to the smart grid are the organizational requirements, IEC 62443 -
2-2, 2-3, 2-4, and 4 -1, and the more technical require ments covered in IEC 62443 -3-3 and 4 -2. 
Requirements for asset owners of industrial control systems are defined in IEC 62443 -2-1 to enhance ISO 
27001 -mandated efforts with domain -specific security controls. For smart grid -related enhancements of 
the inform ation security management framework, ISO 27019 already exists.  
As stated, technical security requirements are specified by distinguishing different security levels for 
industrial automation and control systems. In the set of corresponding documents, securi ty requirements 
are defined not only to target the solution operator and the integrator, but also the product manufacturer.  
A.5.2  IEC 62443 Organization  
As shown in Figure 12, different parts of the standard are grouped into four clusters , covering:  
 Common definitions and metrics.  
 Requirements on setup of a security organization (ISMS related, comparable to ISO 27001, as well 
as solution -supplier and service -provider processes).  
 Technical requirements and methodology for security on a system -wide level.  
 Requirements on the secure development life  cycle of system components, and security 
requirements to such components at a technical level.

International personal communication  
 
According to the methodology described in IEC 62443 -3-2, a complex automation system is 
structured into zones that are connected by and communicate through so -called “conduits” that 
map for example to the logical network protocol communication between two zones. Moreover, 
this document defines security levels (SL) that correlate with the strength of a potential adversary 
as shown in Figure 14. To reach a ded icated SL, the defined requirements have to be fulfilled. IEC 
62443 -3-3 defines system security requirements. It does help to focus only on certain facets of 
security. The security requirements defined by IEC 62443 -3-3 help to ensure that all relevant 
aspects are addressed.  
Part 3 -3 of IEC 62443 defines seven foundational requirements (FR) of a certain category as: 
identification and authentication control (FR1), use control (FR2), system integrity (FR3), data 
confidentiality (FR4), restricted data flow (FR 5), timely response to events (FR6), and resource 
availability (FR7).  
For each foundational requirement, there exists several concrete technical security requirements 
(SR) and requirement enhancements (RE) to address a specific security level. In the conte xt of 
communication security, these security levels are specifically interesting for the conduits connecting 
different zones.  
 
 37 
A.5.3  IEC 62443 Security Levels  
Four Security Levels (SL1, SL2, SL3, and SL4) are defined in IEC 62443 -3-2 correlating with the 
strength of a potential adversary as shown 
in Figure 14. To reach a dedicated security 
level, the requirements (SR) and potential 
enhancements (RE) defined for that 
security level have to be fulfilled. The 
standard foresees that a security 
requirement can be addressed either 
directly or by a compensating 
counterme asure. The concept of 
compensating countermeasures allows to 
reach a certain security level even if some 
requirements cannot be implemented 
directly, e.g., as some components do not 
support the required technical features. 
This approach is in particular im portant 
for existing industrial automation and control systems, so called “brown -field installations,” as 
existing equipment can be continued to be used.  
The security level of a zone or a conduit (a conduit connects zones) is more precisely a security 
level vector with seven elements (see also annex A of IEC 62443 -3-3). The elements of the vector 
designate the security level for each foundational requirement. This allows defining the security 
level specific for each foundational requirement. If, for exampl e, confidentiality is not a security 
objective within a zone, the security level element corresponding to FR4 “Data confidentiality” can 
be defined to be SL1 or even none, although SL3 may be required for other foundational 
requirements (e.g., for FR1, FR2 , and FR3). Hence, the resulting security level vector for a zone 
could be SL= (3, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3) or SL= (2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0).

A.6 IEC 62351 Cybersecurity Series for the Smart Grid25 
A.6.1  IEC 62351 Overview  
The IEC 62351 series of standards includes cybersecurity technologies for the communication 
protocols defined by the IEC TC57,26 specifically the IEC 60870 -5 series, the IEC 60870 -6 series, 
the IEC 61850 series, the IEC 61970 series, and the IEC 61968 seri es. As shown in Figure 16, there 
is not a one -to-one correlation between the IEC TC57 communication standards and the IEC 
62351 security standards. Thi s is because many of the communication standards rely on the same 
underlying standards at different layers. Conformance testing for these standards is also part of the 
series as IEC 62351 -100-xx.

– IEC 60870 -6 (TASE.2/ICCP) using  the Manufacturing Message Specification  (MMS).  
– IEC 61850 -8-1 using the MMS profile of data objects . 
– IEC 61850 -8-2 using Extensible Markup Language (XML) XML schemas  (XSDs ) 
mapped from MMS data objects . 
 IEC 62351 -5: Data and Communication Security – Security for IEC 60870 -5 and 
derivatives (e.g., DNP3). These security standards cover both serial and networked 
profiles used by:  
– IEC 60870 -5-7 (security details for IEC 60870 -5-101 and 104) . 
– IEEE 1815 (DNP3) . 
 IEC 62351 -6: Data and Communication Security – Security for IEC 61850 peer-to-peer 
profiles . These security standards cover profiles in:  
– IEC 61850 that do not run over TCP/IP —generic object -oriented substation event 
(GOOSE ) and sampled value ( SV). 
A.6.3  IEC 62351 Additional Cyber security Standards and Technical Reports  
Additional IEC 62351  cybersecurit y standards and technical reports cover additional areas:  
 IEC 62351 -7: Network and system management (NSM) of the information 
infrastructure, which defines abstract NSM data objects for the power system 
operational environment and reflect s what information  is needed to manage the 
information infrastructure as reliably as the power system infrastructure is managed. A 
mapping to Simple Network Management Protocol ( SNMP ) management information 
bases ( MIBs) was also developed and made available as code componen ts. 
 IEC 62351 -8: Role -Based Access Control (RBAC) for Power System Management. The 
purpose of this standard is to:  
– Introduce “subjects -roles-rights” as an authorization concept (in American National 
Standards Institute -International Committee for Informati on Technology Standards 
[ANSI INCITS ] 359-2004, referred to as “users -roles-permissions”) . 
– Promote role -based access control for the entire pyramid in power system 
management . 
– Enable interoperability in the multi -vendor environment of the power industry . 
– IEC 61850 -90-19 is developing the role-based access control ( RBAC ) requirements 
for IEC 61850.  
 IEC 62351 -9: Key Management. This standard specifies how to generate, distribute, 
revoke, and handle digital certificates and cryptographic keys to protect digital data and 
its communication. Included in the scope is the handling of asymmetric keys (e.g. , private 
keys and X.509 certificates), as well as symmetric keys (e.g. , session keys).  
 IEC Technical Report ( TR) 62351 -10: Security Architecture. This techni cal report 
addresses the description of security architecture guidelines for power systems based on 
essential security controls  (i.e., on security -related components and functions and their 
interaction ).  
 41 
 IEC 62351 -11: Security for XML Files. This standard defines the security requirements for 
exchanges of XML -based documents that are used for IEC  61970 , as well as for some 
types of information exchanges in IEC  61850.  
 IEC TR 62351 -12: Resilience for Power Systems with DER Systems. This technical report 
provi des resiliency recommendations for engineering/operational strategies and  
cybersecurity  techniques that are applied to DER systems. It covers the resilience 
requirements for the many different stakeholders of these dispersed cyber -physical 
generation and s torage devices, with the goal of enhancing the safety, reliability, power 
quality, and other operational aspects of power systems, particularly those with high 
penetrations of DER systems.  
 IEC TR 62351 -13: What Security Topics Should Be Covered in Standards and 
Specifications. This technical report provides guidelines that support the developers of 
standards by addressing  cybersecurity  at the appropriate level s for their standard s. This 
document  provides suggestions on what security topics should be covered in standards 
and specifications that are to be used in the power industry.  
 IEC 62351 -14: Cyber Security Event Logging. This part of the IEC 62351 series specifies 
technical details for the imp lementation of security logs: communication, content , and 
semantics.  
A.6.4  IEC 62351 Technical Specifications for Conformance Testing  
The IEC 62351  cybersecurity  technical specifications for conformance testing are being planned and 
developed. They consist of th e following:  
 Part 100 -1: Conformance Testing for Part 5: in progress as a Technical Specification 
(TS). 
 Part 100 -3: Conformance Testing for Part 3: in progress as a TS. 
 Part 100 -4: MMS (Common Test Cases); new work item proposal ( NWIP ) for a TS. 
 Part 100 -6-1: 61850 -8-1/9-2, 100-6-2: ICCP , and 100-6-3: 61850 -8-2 Conformance testing 
for IEC 61850: NWIP for a TS for 100 -6-1 only . 
 Part 100 -7: Conformance testing for network management —start with discussion in 90 -
3 on what should (or should not) be included in conformance testing . 
 Part 100 -8-1: RBAC; Part 100 -8-2: RBAC for 61850 in 90 -19 (when included in an 
International Standard ( IS) or a TS—maybe 62351 -8-1 or 61850 -xx). 
 Part 100 -9: Conformance testing for key management —Look at  Protocol 
Implementation Conform ance Statement  (PICS) for certificate validation, revocation, 
and management as well as enhancements to Group Domain of Interpretation ( GDOI ). 
 Part 100 -14: Conformance testing for event logging .
