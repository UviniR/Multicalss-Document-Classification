Abstract  
Human life is depending on online services which are making daily life easy and smart 
but facing various challenges of cyber attract , threat and security. Huge numbers of criminal 
activities are increasing day by day using ICT tools and applications. Government 
organizations, citizens, business is being victims by cyber crime and threats. The risks of cyber 
attract and threat is very high. The cyber security strategies, policies , plan and law, help to 
protect e -government systems against threat and attack; and detect abnormal activities.  The aim 
of this paper is to explorer cyber crime and cyber threat and security strategies and law. The 
content analysis and survey method s are used for this research. The study concluded that the 
government must conduct a professional analysis of cyber crime, cyber threat, cyber secu rity, 
and cyber strategies. This article has discussed about the legal  requirements of cyber security.  If 
we are not able to design systems that secure human life and distinguish that usable solutions 
are not sufficient and a crucial component of strong se curity in the future. As we know that 
within a decade, observe our technology turned against us in continued and being more 
sophisticated day to day and how it made destructive attacks and threats. It shows that our future 
will not really happy and healthy  due to cyber insecurity.  
 
Keywords: Cyber crime, cyber threat, cyber se curity, cyber law, e -Governance , e-Government.   
 
1. Introduction  
 
One of the fastest growing areas  [39] of crime including Information and Communication 
Technologies (ICT) and internet is Cybercrime. It is today’s burning issue of each nation which 
is making world economic up and down. It is being essential to gain cyber security knowledge 
and skills, to h elp protect our digital life . The potential ICTs  development and service delivery 
raises  new challenges of the information technology society  [51].Huge numbers of criminal 
activities are increasing day by day using ICT tools and applications. Government, bu siness, 
citizens are facing problems as hacking, intellectual property theft, credit card cloning, phishing, 
software piracy, cyber terrorism, spyware, defamation, cyber flowers, computer virus, social 
violence using IT, cyber -bullying, privacy issue and s o on.  
The g overnments  organizations, citizens, business are being victims by cyber, attract, crime and 
threats. According to Pande  [32], modern technologies supply so as to commit various varies of 
criminal activities. These include attacks against comput er data and information as well as 
systems. In 2007 and 2008 the cost of cybercrime worldwide was estimated at approximately Pramana Research Journal 
Volume 9, Issue 3, 2019 ISSN NO: 2249-2976 
https://pramanaresearch.org/ 662USD eight billion. As for corporate cyber intelligence , cybercriminals have stolen intellectual 
property from businesses worldwide worth up to USD one trillion [5]. 
The everyday life of citizens in modern societies relies on the critical services provided by 
government agencies, business organizations, and concern stakeholders. ICTs are using for 
ongoing operations, control, and monitoring activities, as well as for i nteractions involving data 
exchange from various sources including cloud computing [28 -29]. Cyber -security for 
government systems has recently been gaining a lot of attention towards cyber attract and threat 
[31]. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are technologies 
that help to enhance the security environment of government agencies, private sector companies 
and citizens [2]. 
The computer networks that individuals and organiza tions, for the most part, might as well give 
up in their efforts to protect most of their databases [30]. Securing cyberspace, however, it is 
defined, is an extremely difficult strategic challenge that requires cooperation between the public 
and private se ctors, military and civilian, of our societies [46]. Data protection is being difficult 
today. The whole world looking into computer databanks, government, public organization, and 
citizens have to make careful decisions about data and information security  [30] and security is 
not just a technical issue [18]. Liu [29] have presented work to identify security requirements , 
Schumacher and Roedig [ 41] proposed a set of patterns, and Van Lamsweerde [ 49] defines the 
notion of anti -models, models that capture att ackers, their goals and capabilities.  
Hackers and cyber -criminals understand this phenomenon significantly ; the majority of the 
discussions and research surrounding cyber -security are focused on the technical, security 
strategies and policy making of secur ing cyberspace [ 47].  The hackers, cyber criminals and 
terrorists become more technically sophisticated now. Cyber -security is constantly evolving and 
being updated, in order to adapt to today’s fast -changing scenarios [27] and the security 
community must address root causes of cyber insecurity [3]. 
The objective of a cyber attack includes four areas: loss of integrity, loss of availability, loss of 
confidenti ality and physical destruction [47] . The Internet and cyberspace revolution is changing 
the technol ogy of the workplace and work environment  [52]. There is a continuous awareness 
program to the citizens and training program to ensure people understand security threats, know -
how, and to identify potential issues and behave accordingly to maintain secure e-government 
services  [11-13]. Nepal has seen ups and downs in its technology but due to its limited policies 
and regulation ; it is facing  a huge hindrance in the coming days. Technology has been passed 
and Nepal is facing a huge threats and challenges in overcoming the online activities [42].  
The cyber law is the law governing the digital world and it governs the security and privacy of 
information, crimes relating to the damages. The internal sources are the employees of private or 
public agencies, customers or end users in cyber threat. The external sources are hackers, 
criminal/terrorist groups or or ganizations, intelligence and investigating agencies in cyber threat. 
Threats to the assets may be of different types and of varying intensities and impact values [11-
13]. The assets could be internal or external such as data, information, knowledge resour ces, 
programs, hardware, network and so on. The threat to security of ICT systems may be from 
many sources and in different forms.  Pramana Research Journal 
Volume 9, Issue 3, 2019 ISSN NO: 2249-2976 
https://pramanaresearch.org/ 663Cyber laws have become essential in view of the rapid developments in ICTs. The states can 
respond to computer crime and rela ted criminal law issues associated with these developments 
[42]. The most serious challenges of the 21st century are cyber attract, security and threats. 
Malicious use of ICT can easily be concealed. The growing sophistication and scale of criminal 
activit y increases the potential for harmful actions [11-13]. 
This paper aims provide recommendations for policymakers to draft national cyber security 
strategies to respond to this growing threat. Paper also explores the competing paradigms for 
views problems of  cyber security, and some of the strategies already implemented to identify 
best practices in national security strategy and cyber law.  
2. Literature review:  
2.1Cyber crime:  
The term cybercrime refers to a variety of crimes carried out online, using the inter net through 
computers, laptops, tablets, internet -enabled televisions, games consoles and smartphones [22]. It 
is also defi ned as technology enabled crime, IT crime, digital crime, electronic crime, virtual 
crime, net crime, and high technology crime. Acco rding to Halder  & Jaishankar  [10] defined 
Cybercrimes as: "Offences that are committed against individuals or groups of individuals with a 
criminal motive to intentionally harm the reputation of the victim or cause physical or 
mental  hurt, or loss, to the victim directly or indirectly,  victimization  trendy  telecommunication 
networks  like Internet” .  
It is the crime that involves a computer, a network, new technology and devices [33] and the 
computer may have been used as a weapon of a crime, or it may be th e target as well as 
technology and system [50].  Some  forms of  cyber crimes, natures  and models became  high 
profile,  significantly  those  encompassing  hacking,  infringement of copyright, unwarranted mass -
surveillance,  erotica,  software package  piracy,  materi al possession  outlaw, cyber flower, false 
mail, defamation, and  kid grooming [10].  
A report  revealed  in 2014(sponsored by McAfee),  calculable  that the annual  harm  to the 
worldwide  economy was $445 billion  [8]. Approximately, $1.5 billion was lost in 2012 
to online  credit and  open -end credit  fraud  within the United States [9]. In 2018, a study by 
Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), in partnership with McAfee, concludes 
that on the point of  $600 billion, the nearly  simple fraction  of worldw ide value , is lost to  crime 
annually  [8]. 
2.2. Cyber threat:  
Cyber attacks and cyber terrorism are the new looming threats on the horizon and the country 
needs to focus on specific ar eas to guarantee cybersecurity [6] . The threat to the security of ICT 
system may be from many sources and in different forms. Some of the internal sources of threat 
are the employees of private or public agencies, customers or end users of the programs. The 
external sources of threat  may hackers, criminal/terrorist groups or  organizations, intelligence 
and investigating agencies.  Cybercrime not only threat a person or a nation's security and 
financial health of an organization but also vict imize the social reputation too [44].  Pramana Research Journal 
Volume 9, Issue 3, 2019 ISSN NO: 2249-2976 
https://pramanaresearch.org/ 664Threats to the assets may be of different types a nd varyin g intensities and impact values  [12]. 
Threats to cyber security  are often  nearly  divided into  2 general categories: actions  geared 
toward  and supposed to break  or destroy cyber systems and actions that  ask for  to take advantage 
of the cyber  infras tructure for unlawful. If you use e -mails connected to the Internet, it’s being 
scanned, probed, and attacked constantly with the production of free hacking tools and cheap 
electronic devices [9]. Cyber fundamentals help us to guard against the most common  cyber 
threats and demonstrate our commitment to cyber -security [19].  Threat actors  will operate with 
substantial  freedom  from  just about  anyplace. Many malicious tools and methodologies 
originate  within the  efforts of criminals and hackers  [12].  Public ke y infrastructure providing the 
required level of authentication . The integrity and to have a continuous awareness as well as 
training program to ensure citizens understand security threats know how to identify potential 
issues and behave accordingly to mai ntain secure Government services in the different parts of 
the country [12].  
2.3. Cyber Security  
Cybercrime encompasses any criminal act  handling  computers and networks ; 
and includes  ancient  crimes conducted through  the web [33].  The activity 
of protective  information  and knowledge  systems  like networks, computers database, data  
centers and applications with appropriate procedural and technological security measures is 
referred to as cyber-security. Firewalls, antivirus  computer c ode, and other technological 
solutions for safeguarding personal data and computer networks are essential but not sufficient to 
ensure security.  
Cyber -security has emerged as  a longtime  discipline for  pc systems . Security helps to ensure the 
confidentialit y, availability, and integrity of information systems by pre venting Cyber security 
attacks [48] . Cyber -security covers physical protection  each hardware and  computer code  of 
private  data and technology resources from unauthorized access gained via technolo gical  means 
that is a challenging issue in the country public -private partnership  may be a  key element  of 
cyber security. The public -private engagement may take a variety of forms and may address 
awareness, training, technological improvements, vulnerabili ty remediation and recovery 
operations [12].  
Enhancing cyber -security and protective  crucial  data infrastructure  area unit  essential  to 
every  nation’s security. Cybersecurity plays an important role in the development of IT, as well 
as internet services.  These five basic controls are essential for better cyber security in our 
organization [19].  1) Use a firewall to secure your  net affiliation, 2) Choose the most secure 
settings for your devices and software, 3) Control who has access to your data and servi ces, 
4)Protect yourself from viruses and other malware and 5) Keep your devices and software up to 
date. The traditional protections of small size and remote geography do not extend to cyber 
threats , attract and crime  [20] The international recommendations  for cyber security often 
mention human and technological capacity building and development [38].  
Cyber security is very important to protect the IT services in the corporate establishment, 
government organizations as well as the one used by the general pu blic. Developing countries 
where IT has reached the apex, the security of data compiled, stored and transmitted is almost Pramana Research Journal 
Volume 9, Issue 3, 2019 ISSN NO: 2249-2976 
https://pramanaresearch.org/ 665important [6]. No country has been able to claim the full understanding of possible reason for 
cybercrime and possible damages that ca n come from it. No cyber knowledge can be made 
controlled fully by security forces [42].  
2.4.Cyber Security Strategies : 
The inclusion of nasty  hidden functions  within the  IT will undermine confidence 
in merchandise  and services, and  have an effect on  national security [13]. Making the 
common  subject  of the country  a lot of  tuned in to  the threats  [6]. The prime concern of every 
nation is cyber-security today. The security situation of a country is affected by (1) country’s 
own strategy to maintain security and execution of the strategy, (2) increasing globalization 
trends and (3) use and misuse of ICT practices of the country and global world. Sa fety and 
security have become the principal prerequisites and obligations of a sovereign nation. Scientific 
invention and innovation have altered the world and Nepal too [42].  
 
The strategy’s objectives included the reduction of cyber threats, the establi shment of 
international support , capacity building, and public private cooperation [23]. There are competing 
paradigms for viewing the cyber  security problems [34].  The motivations of nations developing 
national cyber security strategies. The designation of responsi bility for cybersecurity within 
government is varies [24]. The strat egy focused on the three objectives:  (a) raise awareness among 
individuals and small business, (b) improve government cybersecurity, and (c) build strat egic 
relationship to secu re critical infrastructure . The United States published an international strategy 
for cyberspace security [45]. The United States divided responsibility between defense  and 
homeland security [40]. Panama foc used on six pillars in its strat egy: protecting p rivacy and human 
rights, prevention and punishment of cybercrime, fortifying national critical infrastructure, 
building a national cybersecurity, industrial foundation , developing a n ethnicity  of cybersecurity, 
and improving the security and response capability of public entities  [38].  
Cyber -security helps to protect government systems against attack, detect abnormal activities 
services. Information security practice is needed to protect e -governance projects. Security 
policy, plans, practices procedur es must be in position as well as utilization of security 
technology  [13].  The organization’s cyber security level and cyber security is verified by 
independent experts [19]. There is several key recommendations to improve the current cyber -
security posture  [6]. 
 Accept cyber terrorism as a viable near term threat, organize for success and establish the new 
Department of Cyber Security and debate the issues with the Parliament and the public to raise 
awareness . 
 Increase punishment for cyber crimes with terror  or death as a motive and finalize the national 
cyber security plan and implement it.  
 Commit Parliamentary functioning to improve cyber security and manpower training to 
implement the plan effectively.  
2.5.Cyber Law:  
Cyber law  is the  law that has  a spread  of problems  associated with  the 
web and different  communication technology,  as well as  belongings and jurisdiction which Pramana Research Journal 
Volume 9, Issue 3, 2019 ISSN NO: 2249-2976 
https://pramanaresearch.org/ 666control the cyber space. In Nepal cyber law is called as Electronic Transaction Act (ETA) 2063 
[15], which were  passed in 2004. Cyber law i s the law governing the facts that happen in the 
intangible digital world such as giving legal status to the intangible information in the cyberspace 
[13]. The cyber laws  area unit  vital and valid for  control  cyber matters [4].  The Government 
needs to be t ransparent in its function and for the same [ 26]. It is the accountability of the State 
to bring in sufficiently strong legislation to discourage cyber crime, threat, attract and put down 
the abuse of the Internet and other cyber media for any illegal acti vities [ 14].  
Security is mainly about safeguarding the ICT tools of any organization. The assets could be 
internal or external such as data, information, knowledge resources, program s, hardware, and 
networks  and so on  [13]. Cyber warfare poses a large threat to highly computerized societies  and 
culture . No country has been able to develop a safety policy that guarantee full security in the 
communication practices within the context of globe  [42].  Regulatory changes are required for a 
host of activities from procurement to service delivery [13].   Different countries have  completely 
different  cyber laws and cyber laws  control  bodies. In Nepal , cyber law  is termed  as 
Electronic  dealing  Act (ETA) 2063  which is available at: http://www.lawcommission.gov.np.  
Due to lack of proper mechanis m to rule, monitor and policies. The technology may threats the 
nation by criminal activities [32].  Cyber laws are very important. They provide security not only 
to the intellectual property of IT companies but also help to mai ntain the privacy of internet 
users. It helps to keep us safe and to boost the IT economy in the world.  
3. Methodology  
 
Cyber crime is one of the fastest growing areas of crime around the globe. Nepal is not an 
exception to attract, threat of cybercrime. Incr easing internet and computer users and the growth 
of technology are grooming cyber crime. Nepal faces a huge hindrance due to its limited policies 
and regulation. Cybercrimes has grown day by day, individuals, organizations, and governments 
have struggled to find ways to defend against the cyber attract and threat. IT is changing all 
aspects of human activity and in such case Cyber law is essential now. The survey and content 
analysis methods are using during this research. The survey data collected from go vernment 
employees who are on duty at different part of the nation. International journals, books, 
government reports are also reference of the study.   
4. Result and Analysis  
Huge numbers of criminal activities are increasing day by day using ICT tools, infrastructure and 
applications. Government organizations, citizens, business are being victims by cyber crime and 
threats. Government employees know about cybercrimes, cyber th reat, cyber security and cyber 
law. It is revealed in Table 1. 85.7% of respondents responded that they are aware of cybercrime, 
threat, security and law.

Table 2 gives the meaning of cybercrime as respondents understood: Taking or giving 
information  by unauthentic use of other person's computer (76.4%) stated unauthentic use of 
other person's computer, mobile, telephone, ATM card (73.69) etc. is found to be taken by the 
respondent as cybercrime. Similarly, other definitions as understood by responden ts include 
leakage of personal as well as official information (74.3) and unauthentic upload of video, audio 
and photo in the social media site (72.1%) Offense against the nation using IT (73.6%)  
Threatening and harassing someone through telephone, mobile,  internet, email and other 
electronic media (72.1 %) and Hacking passwords, Wi -Fi, websites in order to hamper the 
dignity of a person, family, society, unions, organization and nation (71.4) are the major cyber 
crime activities.

5. Discussion  
Cyber security is considered as a national security . An issue of each nation could  impact the lives 
of citizens each day [1]. Implementation of commanding national cyber security strategies must 
enhance the percentages for fulfillment. Cybe r security coverage that inhibits loose expression 
within the name of safety is inconsistent with human right.  
For the protection of e -governance projects, there is a need for information security based 
practices. Security policies and plan help to protec t e-government systems against threat and 
attack, and to detect abnormal activities services.  
UK cyber security method set up a brand new workplace of cyber  security inside the cab inet 
workplace at the side of multi -enterprise cyber  security operation midd le locate d within the army 
headquarters [7]. The U.S. cyber  security strategy turned into additional weighted in the direction 
of national security models [25][35][36][37].  The law deals  with problems  associated with  a Pramana Research Journal 
Volume 9, Issue 3, 2019 ISSN NO: 2249-2976 
https://pramanaresearch.org/ 668digital signature,  belongings, cyberc rime, etc. Due to lack of proper monitoring, supervision, and 
updates, protecting user’s online data throu gh cyber law is present.  
The global and regional agencies inclusive of the ITU [17], European Union [ 16], and OECD  
[43] have poste d pointers for national cyber se curity strategy development. The private sector’s 
function in national safety approach has all started to emerge. The method blanketed 
recommendations for setting up excessive stage government accountability for cyber -security, 
establishin g a national cyber -security coordinator, and the improvement of training packages for 
most of the people and the cyber -security workforce [17].  Why not recruit cyber army and make 
different defense cyber security force?  
6. Conclusion  
As disruptive activities using ICTs are more complex and dangerous in the cyberspace. The 
hackers, cybercriminals, and terrorists become more technically sophisticated now. It concludes 
that the security community must address root causes of cyber insecurity. A ctions for securing 
information and information systems are required to be done at different levels in the e -
Governance activities.  The responsibility of the State is to herald  sufficiently  sturdy legislation to 
discourage and  place  down the misuse of  the web  and other cyber media for any nefarious 
activities. Network services providers (ISP), large businesses and small users/home users are also 
required to play their role to enhance the security of cyber space within the country. This paper 
has discussed the cyber crime, thre at, security strategies, and legal  requirements of Cyber 
security, security training and awareness in providing a comprehensive e -Governance initiative. 
Further research is required in the e -Governance vision, policies and strategies.  If we are not able 
to design systems that secure human life and distinguish that usable solutions are not sufficient 
and a crucial component of strong security in the future. As we know that within a decade, see 
our technology turned against us in continued and being more soph isticated day to day and 
destructive attacks  and threats. It shows that our future wi ll not really happy and healthy  due to 
cyber insecurity.  
7. Recommendations  
Department of Information and Technology of Nepal (DoIT)  [21] has provided suggestions 
regarding Cyber security:  
 Use strong Passwords and use different user ID . Make the password more complicated by 
combining letters, numbers, and special  characters and change them regularly.  
 Don’t share it with anyone. Avoid replying unknown emails and do not open emails from 
unknown sources. Do not respond to emails asking for personal information, credit card number, 
pin-code, password etc.  
 Keeping word/ PIN codes safe and  memorize. Read pri vacy and policy statements before any 
transaction.  
 Surf only through a secure website. Log out immediately after completed online job.  
 Check account statement to ensure that unauthorized transaction has taken place or not. Safe 
online banking and online s hopping and safely access Social networking websites.  
 Be careful  whereas communication  with persons  met online  
 Make friends only known friends. Remove inappropriate information from profile. Do not post 
personal information on social media. While using the  internet at public place remember that Pramana Research Journal 
Volume 9, Issue 3, 2019 ISSN NO: 2249-2976 
https://pramanaresearch.org/ 669internet browsers like IE, Mozilla Firefox, Gmail, Hotmail etc. will save password on that 
browser and account may be hacked.  
 Firewalls monitor open connections including attachments in an email, block unauthorized 
inbound and outbound internet traffic and disable internet add -ons such as cookies, pop -ups etc.
