Abstract
The identiﬁcation and assessment of risks are a fundamental part of cybersecurity. Determining the elements that par-
ticipate in this ﬁeld is difﬁcult because there is no exclusive approach to cybersecurity. This document aims to provide a
framework to identify and assess cybersecurity risks. For this, a systematic review of the studies related to cybersecurityrisk taxonomies was carried out. The main elements of the proposed conceptual model and framework have been deter-
mined by applying the snowball technique. To validate the implementation of the proposed framework, a case study has
been implemented at the Ecuadorian Social Security Institute. The ﬁrst task was to consolidate the information in abaseline. Once the baseline was obtained, the deﬁned framework has been applied. As a result, through the use of the
proposed framework, the assessment process has improved the decision-making process regarding the importance and
criticality of the risks and countermeasures that must be applied.

1 Introduction
Cybersecurity is a widely used term that deals with the
security of information systems and data, but it has many
different deﬁnitions. According to the ESET securitycommunity [ 1], cybersecurity is deﬁned as ‘‘protection of
information assets, through the treatment of threats that put
at risk the information that is processed, stored and trans-
ported by the interconnected information systems’’.
Therefore, it is a discipline that involves technology, peo-ple, information, and processes to allow risk-free
operations.In this context, the interest in cybersecurity issues is
increasing [ 2–4]. Almost every week or every day, you
hear about the violation of cybersecurity or a similar
incident. The most common incidents are usually: personal
information compromised, stolen credit cards, lost medicalrecords, unauthorized access and theft of business infor-
mation, and attacks on critical systems, among others.
In recent years, these incidents have been published in
press headlines, and the impact of intrusions on informa-
tion systems is detailed, such as, for example [ 5]:
•In September 2018. British Airways (BA)—380,000
affected customers. On its website, BA said that the
stolen data included personal and ﬁnancial details ofcustomers who make reservations and changes on
ba.com and the airline’s application.
•In 2018. Facebook—50 million compromised accounts.
Facebook announced that a vulnerability embedded in
the ‘‘See as’’ feature allows strangers to steal authen-tication tokens from 50 million users. Personal data
affected by hacking was extended to private publica-
tions, conversations, records, images sent by chat, andmuch more.
•In November 2018. Marriot—500 million records. At
the end of November, the world’s largest hotel chaindiscovered that it had been the goal of a sophisticated

Author's personal copyoperation in which hackers extracted personal and
ﬁnancial data from half a billion customers over4 years.
Currently, laws are punishing such crimes with
increasing severity. In 2019, companies must be smart toconsolidate their security posture and avoid hefty ﬁnes and
irreparable damage to their image. One way to start
addressing cybersecurity would be to analyze the situationin which the organization is in this area, through the
implementation of maturity models related to
cybersecurity.
The way organizations address cybersecurity capacity is
essential for effective, efﬁcient, and sustainable cyberse-
curity. In order organizations can improve their cyberse-curity capabilities, industry and the technical community
have developed cybersecurity maturity models that mea-
sure cybersecurity capabilities and position them at dif-ferent levels for continuous improvement, due to change is
continuous in terms of threats, vulnerabilities, risks, strat-
egy, and organizational needs.
Therefore, the maturity levels vary from an initial level,
where an organization may have just begun to consider
cybersecurity, to a dynamic scenario, where an organiza-tion can adapt quickly to changes in the cybersecurity
environment.
The cybersecurity maturity models provide a benchmark
to assess the current level of capacity of the practices,
processes, and methods that organizations have imple-mented in terms of cybersecurity. There are several
maturity models that industry uses for assessing the
maturity levels. The main maturity models named instudies of scientiﬁc journals according to the systematic
review [ 6] are: the Cybersecurity Capability Maturity
Model (C2M2) [ 7], the National Initiative for Cybersecu-
rity Education (NICE) [ 8], the Systems Security Engi-
neering Capability Maturity Model (SSE-CMM) [ 9], and
the Community Cyber Security Maturity Model (CCSMM)[10].
All these maturity models most named in the scientiﬁc
papers identify cybersecurity risk management as a fun-damental element in the initial level of maturity. Risk
management is a cornerstone of proper governance
guidelines [ISO 38500] [ 11], both in the public and private
sectors, where it is considered a fundamental principle that
government decisions are based on knowledge of involved
risks. The main literature on cybersecurity risks [ 2,12–14]
agrees that assets, cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats
should be identiﬁed as fundamental elements. Even, there
are entire books dedicated to risk management, althoughthe focus on cybersecurity is still incipient [ 2,15–19].
The fundamental knowledge of these elements has been
deﬁned through conceptual models [ 15,20–23]. Theseconceptual models relate these fundamental elements,
however each model does so according to its particular
approach, for example, some of them are focused on the
cloud computing (see Sect. 2). Therefore, a framework for
assessing risks based on the conceptual models has been
deﬁned in this paper, which is focused on cybersecurity.
This article is organized as follows: Sect. 2introduces
the context of cybersecurity conceptual models; Sect. 3
gives the details of the proposed framework. Section 4
reports the results obtained in a case study carried out
based on the proposed framework, and the results obtained
are compared with the company’s old way of working(called the baseline). And ﬁnally, Sect. 5presents the
conclusions that have been identiﬁed and future research
lines.
2 Context
Considering that cybersecurity risks are the starting pointof all cybersecurity maturity models, a systematic review(SR) regarding cybersecurity risk taxonomies was carried
out [ 24]. In this SR, it was found that some articles [ 12–14]
identify international standards as references, such as thestandards of the National Institute of Standards and Tech-
nology (NIST) [ 15]. These articles identify the main ele-
ments, indicated above, involved in the cybersecurity riskmanagement. To perform the analysis of the articles
identiﬁed in the SR, the snowball technique [ 25] was used
in order to identify the elements that should be consideredin a conceptual model of cybersecurity risk management,
independently of its approach and use.
From the snowball technique [ 25] applied to the articles
obtained by the systematic review [ 24], the main elements
of the conceptual model of cybersecurity risk management
and their relationships have been determined. This infor-mation has served as the basis for the design of the pro-
posed conceptual model. The documents considered have
been: [ 20], focused on the relationship of terms, and
security ontologies; [ 21], focused on risk entities and its
relationships; [ 22], focused on risk entities and its rela-
tionships; [ 15], focused on the main risk factors; and [ 23],
focused on cybersecurity information.
In addition, continuing with the application of the
snowball technique [ 25] to the conceptual models indicated
in the previous articles, the following conceptual models of
ontologies and taxonomies have been considered for this
proposal: [ 26], focused on asset ontologies per user; [ 27],
focused on asset ontologies; [ 28], paper focused on tax-
onomy of impacts on assets; [ 29], focused on mobile asset
taxonomy; [ 30], focused on threat taxonomy; [ 31], focused
on taxonomy of voice over IP threats; [ 32], focused on
attack ontology; [ 33], focused on attack taxonomy; [ 34],Cluster Computing
123
Author's personal copyfocused on vulnerability taxonomy; [ 35], focused on vul-
nerability taxonomy based on information attributes; [ 36],
paper focused on vulnerability taxonomy; and [ 37],
focused on vulnerability taxonomy.
From the analysis made to the previous articles, the
following particularities have been identiﬁed:
•Conceptual models have different approaches according
to speciﬁc needs, although they identify the elements of
cybersecurity risk management.
•The critical elements that should be considered in
cybersecurity risk management are: the organization’s
assets, the cybersecurity vulnerabilities of the assets,and the cybersecurity threats that materialize the
cybersecurity vulnerabilities, generating the cybersecu-
rity risks.
•There are countermeasures that help mitigate the impact
of risks. Some countermeasures do so against threats
and others against vulnerabilities.
•The participation of the security dimensions (conﬁden-
tiality, availability, and integrity) as part of the elementsof the conceptual models of cybersecurity risk man-
agement is not shown.
•An analysis related to the vulnerabilities of the assets
based on security dimensions is not found.
As a result of this analysis, it has been determined that
there is no common framework for cybersecurity becausethe conceptual models identiﬁed are based on particular
approaches, and use different semantics for the relation-
ships of the main elements of cybersecurity risks (assets,vulnerabilities, threats, and risks).
For this reason, for the cybersecurity framework pro-
posed in this paper and based on the conceptual riskmodels, it is necessary to establish a conceptual model that
establishes the relationships of the elements found in
cybersecurity risk management.
Next, the activities carried out to establish the proposed
conceptual model are:
•Identify the entities that participate in cybersecurity risk
management based on the main elements above.
•Establish the relationships between each of the entities
identiﬁed.
•Determine the cardinality between the entities
identiﬁed.
Then, a diagram has been made with the concepts and
relationships of the identiﬁed entities, which is shown inFig. 1. The grey entities are a result of applying the
snowball technique. The rest of the entities (white) were
included to complement the conceptual model of cyber-security risk management. The relationships between the
elements have been generated considering the cybersecu-
rity approach, and obtaining the following added value:•From the relationship of the asset with vulnerability ,i t
is important to note that the entity assessment dimen-
sion describes the characteristics that can be measured
in the vulnerabilities. The most common characteristics
are availability, integrity, and conﬁdentiality, althoughcriticality, authenticity or traceability could also be
included.
•Another important relationship of this conceptual model
is that countermeasures are directly related to the
cybersecurity vulnerabilities of assets.
3 AVARCIBER: a framework for identifying
and assessing cybersecurity risks
The conceptual model deﬁned in the previous section
serves as the basis for the deﬁnition of a framework, namedAVARCIBER by its Spanish Acronym (Assets, Vulnera-
bilities, Threats, Risks of Cybersecurity). ISO 27005 con-
tains guidelines for the risk management process; therefore,parameters of ISO 27005 [ 16] have been used as a refer-
ence, extending speciﬁc parameters that we will indicate
below. The implementation of a framework for cyberse-curity risk management must follow a series of steps (ac-
tivities and tasks) to be effective and adequately fulﬁll its
function. The activities that should be followed in theimplementation of the framework are described in detail
below.
3.1 AVARCIBER activities
For the implementation of the framework, it is necessary toperform the six main activities described below.
3.1.1 Activity 1: launch
The framework makes extensive use of taxonomies as an
element to help identify risks. Taxonomies represent the
prior knowledge that the organization has regarding the
types of assets to be protected, and also the type of vul-nerabilities and threats to focus the efforts of the organi-
zation. Therefore, in this launching activity, the
taxonomies corresponding to assets, cybersecurity vulner-abilities, and cybersecurity threats are established and/or
updated. The organization must be aware of the importance
of establishing and maintaining updated taxonomies toaddress the ever-changing cybersecurity environment.
An organization could adopt an industry taxonomy as a
basis for generating its own taxonomies. The tasks to beperformed in this activity are the following:
•Task 1: establish the taxonomy of assets (based, for
example, on the standard ISO 27005 [ 16]).Cluster Computing
123
Author's personal copy•Task 2: establish the taxonomy of cybersecurity
vulnerabilities (based, for example, on the standard
ISO 27005 [ 16]).
•Task 3: establish the taxonomy of cybersecurity threats
(based, for example, on ENISA 2018 [ 38]).
3.1.2 Activity 2: identify and assess assets
This activity refers to the effort that every organization
must make to start raising awareness about cybersecurity
among all members of the organization. One of the initial
questions to ask is: what do we want to protect? Therefore,in this activity an analysis of the elements that are most
important for the organization is made, taking into con-
sideration the following questions: What activity do we do?
What is most important for the organization? What are the
institutional objectives? What services do I provide?
The tasks to be performed in this activity are the
following:•Task 1: assets are selected from the taxonomy previ-
ously established in the previous activity (Activity 1 –
Task 1) or are identiﬁed by the organization.
•Task 2: the organization identiﬁes the security dimen-
sions (commonly integrity, conﬁdentiality, and avail-
ability) for the assets, and measures the impact of theasset. The assessment of the impact value related to the
asset is based on ISO 27005 [ 16] (see Table 1).
•Task 3: the criticality of the asset is done by taking the
highest value of the impact of the asset from the
security dimensions calculated in Task 2. An example
of the above is shown in Table 2.
3.1.3 Activity 3: assess the damage level
for the vulnerability-asset (dimension) tuples
In this activity, the damage level related to the cyberse-
curity vulnerabilities of the assets of the organization must
be determined. The assessment of the vulnerability damage

Author's personal copylevel is carried out based on the values showed in Table 3
and established by the organization. The values proposed inTable 3have been obtained from ISO 27005 [ 16], adding
the damage level of ‘‘extreme damage’’, ‘‘very high’’ and
‘‘negligible’’. These three damage levels allow us to have abetter accuracy at the time of assigning the damage level of
the vulnerability. The organization must determine the
value of the damage level related to the vulnerability foreach dimension (conﬁdentiality, availability, integrity, and,
also, criticality) of the asset. The assessment of the vul-
nerability damage level is done by deﬁning the importance
and impact in the event that the damage to the asset is
beyond repair.
For example, if it is estimated that the damage that could
occur in the asset due to the linked vulnerability is ‘‘high’’,
then the assigned damage level related to the tuple vul-nerability—asset(dimension) would be between 6 and 8.The tasks to be performed in this activity are the
following:
•Task 1: assign cybersecurity vulnerabilities to each
asset from those identiﬁed in the previously establishedvulnerability taxonomy.
•Task 2: evaluate the damage level for each vulnerabil-
ity-asset (dimension) tuple. The assessment will be
carried out for each security dimension (including
criticality), considering the damage levels deﬁned inTable 3. An example of the assessment of the damage
levels of vulnerability on the asset for each dimension is
shown in Table 4.
•Task 3: accumulate the damage values for each
vulnerability-asset tuple, regardless of its dimension.
In the example, the total damage value of the vulner-ability-asset tuple ‘‘Vulnerability 1 – Asset 1’’ would be
equal to 20 (1 ?3?8?8).
•Task 4: obtain the average damage value of the
vulnerability-asset tuple. In the example, the average
damage value of the vulnerability-asset tuple ‘‘Vulner-
ability 1 – Asset 1’’ would be 5 (20 divided by 4dimensions considered) (see Table 5,Average Damage
Value column).
•Task 5: repeat tasks 2, 3, and 4 for all vulnerability-
asset tuples.
•Task 6: assign a monetary value to each vulnerability-
asset (dimension) tuples that are affecting the assets ofthe organization. This value is called the Damage Cost .
The damage cost is a function of both the market price
of the asset, as well as the expected damage, and itsreplacement (see Damage Cost column in Table 5).
•Task 7: assign a monetary cost to each asset. The
organization determines this cost for the asset in case ithad loss or damage, according to the commercial value
and the cost of replacing it (see Asset Cost column in
Table 5).Table 1 Assessment of the impact value related to the asset based on ISO 27005

Author's personal copy3.1.4 Activity 4: identify cybersecurity threats
In this activity, cybersecurity threats that can affect the
organization, and may materialize the cybersecurity vul-
nerabilities in the assets are identiﬁed. To do this, it isnecessary to: (1) relate the cybersecurity threats with the
existing vulnerabilities, (2) calculate the average damage
value of the cybersecurity vulnerabilities associated withthe threat, and (3) calculate the total cost of the damage of
the cybersecurity vulnerabilities associated with the threat.
The tasks to be performed in this activity are the
following:
•Task 1: identify all cybersecurity threats from the
taxonomy of cybersecurity threats previously estab-
lished in Activity 1—Task 3.
•Task 2: determine the vulnerabilities of the organiza-
tion’s assets that may materialize for each cybersecuritythreat. Threats-Vulnerabilities tuples, and Threats-Vul-
nerabilities-Asset tuples (by the association of thepreviously deﬁned relationships) are established.
•Task 3: from the previous activity, and for all the
identiﬁed vulnerability-asset tuples, recover the calcu-lated values of: average damage value, and damage
cost, and assign them to the tuples Threats-Vulnerabil-
ities-Assets, as shown in Table 6.
•Task 4: Threats are grouped, then the average damage
value of the threat (called Threat Damage Value )i s
calculated with the average of the average damagevalues of Table 6related to the same Threat. In the case
of Threat 1, Threat Damage Value is ((5 ?4.75?7.75)/
3) = 5.83, as shown in Table 7. In the case of the Threat
Damage Cost , the calculation is done adding the
Damage Cost of the vulnerability-asset tuples affected
by the threat that is considered. In the case of Threat 1,Table 4 Damage level of the

3.1.5 Activity 5: measure the risk
The associated risk is the potential impact (I, impact)
multiplied by the probability of occurrence of the threat (F,frequency). The potential impact is the Threat Damage
Value (rounded). The organization must establish the
probability of occurrence of previous threats according tothe company’s values. An example is shown in Table 8,
taking as reference the ISO 27005 standard [ 16], and
adding two new ranks: ‘‘very high’’ and ‘‘very low’’ toidentify very imminent and also negligible probabilities of
occurrence.
An example is shown in Table 9, with values that have
been taken as a reference from ISO 27005 [ 16].
The organization could establish:
•Low risk: the risk value ranges between 0 to 3 (green
color in Table 9).
•Medium risk: the risk ranges between 4 to 6, (yellow in
Table 9).
•High risk: the risk ranges between 7 to 8 (orange in
Table 9).
•Extreme risk: the risk ranges between 9 to 10 (red in
Table 9).
This would help the organization to make decisions: for
example, establish a policy of focusing on the red and
orange risks.
The tasks to be performed in this activity are the
following:
•Task 1: retrieve the value of the Threat Damage Value
(the impact) for each threat (the value that was previ-
ously calculated in Activity 4 – Task 4), as well as the
Damage Cost of the threat (the value that was previ-
ously calculated in Activity 4 – Task 4).
•Task 2: assign the probability of occurrence of the
threat. For this, similar cases that have occurred in thecompany and the experience of the personnel in charge
are taken as a reference. In this way, the frequency of
occurrence is deﬁned for each threat (see Table 8).
•Task 3: calculate the exposure to the cybersecurity risk
(Risk = Impact x Frequency), as deﬁned in Table 9.3.1.6 Activity 6: perform countermeasures
The organization will establish, as an organization policy,
what risks to attack based on the available information. To
perform this activity, the organization must analyze each of
the risks that may be most likely to be executed by takingthe reading of the risk measurement and the impact in the
organization, as well as the costs that could affect the
organization. In this way, the organization will be able totake the necessary countermeasures.
The tasks to be performed in this activity are the
following:
•Task 1: generate a countermeasure that can mitigate or
eliminate potential risks. These countermeasures arefocused on the cybersecurity vulnerabilities identiﬁed.
Note that countermeasures can counteract one or more
vulnerabilities.
•Task 2: generate controls to verify if countermeasures
have come to counteract the apparent risk of a threat by
materializing the vulnerabilities of the asset. Thecontrols allow monitoring one or several
countermeasures.
4 Case study
A case study was used to validate the implementation ofthe framework described above. The case study was carried
out at the Ecuadorian Institute of Social Security (IESS byits Spanish acronym) in the city of Quito-Ecuador. The
IESS is an entity whose organization and operation are
based on the principles of solidarity, obligation, univer-sality, equity, efﬁciency, subsidiarity, and sufﬁciency. It is
responsible for applying the Compulsory General Insur-
ance System that is part of the National Social Security
System.
The IESS has 30,000 employees and has seven general
directorates that correspond to the seven main processes of
the organization. In addition, the IESS has three additional
directorates where support processes are located. One ofthese three directorates is the National Information Tech-
nology Directorate (DNTI by its Spanish acronym), whoseTable 7 Threats with damage value and damage cost

Author's personal copymission is to: provide and manage information technology
services, which will ensure an efﬁcient access control andinformation security for the management of the institution,
aligned with the institutional mission and the current reg-
ulatory framework. The DNTI is made up of the followingsub-directorates: National Subdirectorate of Information
Technology Infrastructure (SNTI by its Spanish acronym),
National Subdirectorate of Computer Development (SNDI
by its Spanish acronym), National Subdirectorate of
Architecture and Solutions (SNAS by its Spanish acro-nym), and National Ofﬁce of Information Security (SNDSI
by its Spanish acronym).
SNTI is responsible for managing the installation, con-
ﬁguration and implementation of technology services
infrastructure, according to institutional needs in order to
improve the availability of technological services. There-fore, the technological equipment is in charge of the SNTI,
and it is where the work of identiﬁcation of assets was
carried out. The Risk Identiﬁcation and Assessmentincluded: identifying, controlling, and eliminating or min-
imizing events that may affect IT resources.
The organization used the Spanish methodology of
Analysis and Risk Management of Information Systems
(MAGERIT) as a reference methodology. However, there
was no initial baseline of risks, as there was no formal riskmanagement document. Therefore, it had to be done almost
from scratch. There were only isolated efforts but they
were not consolidated or analyzed, so an important effort(from October 2018 to April 2019) of standardization of
the existing information had to be made. Two DNTI people
in charge of the IESS host platform and one of the authorsof this paper (as an external consultant) participated in this
case study. Each person of the DNTI used a total of 120 hof work, and the external consultant a total of 480 effective
hours of work.
Once the baseline was obtained, the AVARCIBER
framework deﬁned above has been applied. This will allow
us to know the advantages/disadvantages and the possible
improvements of the framework against the current way of
working (called baseline).
For the case study, it was decided to establish as a work
area, the IESS Host Platform. The IESS Host platform
servers are a critical and important asset for the organiza-
tion, since these servers execute transactions that have notyet been migrated to the Labor History System. Therefore,
it is very important that there is high availability of this
platform because the Labor History applications requireinformation from the Host Platform to provide the beneﬁts
and services to the insured.
The analysis of the IESS Host Platform was carried out,
initially performing the baseline and then applying
AVARCIBER. The results obtained in both cases (baseline
and AVARCIBER) are shown in order to compare theresults.

Author's personal copy4.1.1 Activity 1: launch
The organization did not have its own taxonomies related
to assets, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and cybersecurity
threats.
The tasks to be performed in this activity are:
•Task 1: establish the taxonomy of assets. AVARCIBER
recommends using ISO 27005 [ 16]. This taxonomy is
focused on classifying the assets. The categories or type
of assets are: hardware, software, networks, people,facilities, and organizational structure.
•Task 2: establish the taxonomy of cybersecurity
vulnerabilities. AVARCIBER recommends using ISO27005 [ 16]. This taxonomy is classiﬁed according to the
type of asset that would be affected, as shown in
Table 10.
•Task 3: establish the taxonomy of cybersecurity threats.
AVARCIBER recommends using ENISA 2018 [ 38].
This taxonomy is classiﬁed by the impact on theorganization, as shown in Table 11.4.1.2 Activity 2: identify and assess assets
The assets are selected from the asset taxonomy (Activity
1—Task 1) in the case of AVARCIBER. In the case of the
baseline, the assets selected in AVARCIBER were used.
The measurement of the criticality of the assets is car-
ried out in a similar way, both in the baseline and when
applying AVARCIBER.
The tasks to be performed in this activity are:
•Task 1: those assets that participate in the IESS Host
platform have been selected, based on the taxonomy
assets. The Asset column in Table 12shows the
selected cybersecurity assets.
•For the case study and in order to reduce space, only
some hardware assets have been considered in
Table 12.
•Task 2: the asset assessment column shows the
measured cybersecurity dimensions, and their impact
value.
•Task 3: the highest value from the other dimensions is
selected as the criticality value.
All values are shown in Table 12.
4.1.3 Activity 3: assess the damage level
for the vulnerability—asset (dimension) tuples
In this activity, the damage level of the cybersecurity
vulnerabilities of the assets of the organization must bedetermined.
In the case of the baseline, although they identify the
assets and the vulnerabilities associated, however, they donot assess the damage value related to the vulnerability-
asset tuple.
AVARCIBER calculates the damage value of the vul-
nerability-asset tuples taking into account all security
dimensions, including criticality. Then, the average dam-age value of the vulnerability asset tuples is calculated. The
damage costs associated with each identiﬁed cybersecurity
vulnerability-asset tuple is established by the owner of theasset.Table 10 Sample of Vulnerability Taxonomy (by asset) related to the

Author's personal copyFor the case study and in order to reduce space, only
some cybersecurity vulnerabilities are going to beconsidered.
The tasks to be performed in this activity are:
•Task 1: assign cybersecurity vulnerabilities to each of
the assets. In this task, both the baseline (see Table 13)
and AVARCIBER (see Table 14), identify the cyber-
security vulnerabilities for each asset.
Table 14(AVARCIBER) presents a smaller number of
vulnerabilities than the Baseline (see Table 12). In the case
of AVARCIBER, vulnerabilities are standardized.•Task 2: evaluate the damage level for each vulnerabil-
ity-asset (dimension) tuple.
•The baseline does not consider this task.
•In AVARCIBER, the result of this task is represented
by the columns Availability (A), Integrity (I), Conﬁ-
dentiality (C), andCriticality (Cr) of Table 15.
•Task 3, 4: accumulate the damage values for each
vulnerability-asset tuple, regardless of its dimension,
and calculate the average damage value of the security
dimensions, including criticality. The average damage
value is placed in Column Average Damage Value

•Task 5: repeat tasks 2, 3, and 4 for all vulnerability-
asset tuples.
•Task 6: assign a monetary value to each of the
vulnerability-asset (dimension) tuples. Take into
account that the damage cost is a function of both the
market price of the asset, as well as the expected
damage, and its replacement. The monetary value of the
vulnerability-asset is entered by the organization in thecolumn Damage Cost of Table 15.
•Task 7: assign a monetary cost to each asset. The
organization determines this cost in case if had loss ordamage, using the current market value and the cost of
replacing it. The asset value is entered in column Asset

some cybersecurity threats are going to be considered.
The tasks to be performed in this activity are:
•Task 1: identify all cybersecurity threats from the
taxonomy threats (Activity 1—Task 3) previously
deﬁned. Threats are chosen for each vulnerability as
shown in column Threat of Table 16.

Author's personal copy4.1.5 Activity 5: measure the risk
In the baseline, a vulnerability threat assignment was made
and only the impact is calculated based on the dimensions
of the asset (availability, integrity, conﬁdentiality) for eachthreat (in terms of percentage). The risk is calculated based
on the impact (IM) of the threat and the frequency (FR) of
occurrence of the threat, as it can be seen in Table 18.
In this activity, AVARCIBER groups the threats, and in
order to calculate the total threat damage value, the average
is calculated. In the same way, the total threat damage costis calculated adding the threat damage costs involved.These values are then analyzed for each threat, only to
identify the frequency of occurrence, and calculate the risk
of the threat, as shown in Table 19.
The tasks to be performed in this activity are:
•Task 1: retrieve the rounded value of the Threat
Damage Value (the impact) and the Damage Cost of the
Threat, as shown in the Table 19.
•Task 2: assign the probability of occurrence of the
threat, as it can be seen in column Frequency of
Table 19.
•Task 3: calculate the exposure to cybersecurity risk.
The risk is calculated according to the data deﬁned inTable 17 Threat damage value

The information to be highlighted in this table is the

4.1.6 Activity 6: perform countermeasuresIn the baseline, a countermeasure (safeguard) is identiﬁed
for each asset, to solve the identiﬁed cybersecurity threatsand vulnerabilities. Thus, a countermeasure is obtained for
each asset, as shown in Table 20.
In this activity, AVARCIBER determines the identiﬁ-
cation of a countermeasure for each cybersecurity vulner-
ability that has been identiﬁed in assets. Thus, it is possible
to implement mechanisms that help mitigate the identiﬁedrisks. The prioritization of countermeasures to be imple-
mented is directly related to the risks and the value asso-
ciated with the identiﬁed threats (total threat damage cost).Countermeasures are shown in Table 21.4.2 Results of comparing the baseline
and AVARCIBER
Next, the results when comparing the baseline and the
application of the AVARCIBER framework to the Host
platform of the IESS are presented.
•The conceptual model for the cybersecurity risk man-
agement of the baseline is based on threat management
and AVARCIBER on vulnerabilities. Therefore,AVARCIBER is generating greater control in the
identiﬁcation and mitigation of cybersecurity risks.
•The parameters of impacts and damages of the baseline
are qualitative and have an insufﬁcient number of
deﬁned levels. The lack of levels was the reason why
the impacts could not be obtained in a more preciseway. In AVARCIBER, the levels are quantitative, and
also new ones have been incorporated. These reasons
are what allows AVACIBER to achieve greater accu-racy when assigning values.
•The baseline does not handle taxonomies of assets,
cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats, generatingerrors when entering them manually. With theTable 19 Risks for the IESS Host Platform

Author's personal copytaxonomies deﬁned in AVARCIBER, the assignment of
the values was facilitated without incurring in duplica-
tion or syntax errors.
•The baseline does not assess the costs of the vulner-
abilities associated with the assets, while AVARCIBER
does. This allows to add the total value of all common
vulnerabilities per threat, with a total cost assigned toeach threat in order to identify the most expensive
threat to the organization.
•The risk matrix in the baseline shows the risk values
according to the impact of threats. In AVARCIBER, the
cost of the associated risk is included, which generates
information to identify the critical risks.
•Countermeasures at the baseline are assigned per asset.
In AVARCIBER, the countermeasures are identiﬁed by
vulnerabilities that may arise in several assets, allowinggreater coverage with a single countermeasure.
5 Conclusions
This paper has presented a conceptual model for cyberse-
curity risk management. In addition, a framework has been
presented (AVARCIBER) to manage cybersecurity risksbased on the conceptual model. The framework has been
applied in a case study to be validated. The following can
be concluded:
•The conceptual model includes the assessment of the
cybersecurity vulnerabilities of assets, which hasallowed us to measure not only the impact of the
vulnerability, but also the cost in case of vulnerability.
•The elements of the conceptual model and the deﬁned
framework have been complemented, generating results
that respond to the needs of the organization such as
establishing countermeasures based on a quantitativerisk assessment. This improvement allows the organi-
zation not only to manage the risks for its impact, but
also because of the cost to the organization.•The use of taxonomies generated from assets, cyberse-
curity vulnerabilities and threats have allowed better
management. A problem that has been avoided is the
duplication of vulnerabilities and threats because therewas no standard.
•The identiﬁcation of asset costs and assessment of asset
vulnerabilities has helped to quantitatively identify theimpact of threats in materializing vulnerabilities. In this
way, the understanding of the economic damage to
which they are exposed has been improved.
•It has generated greater visibility of the critical threats
and of the most recurrent vulnerabilities, complemented
with the assessment of each one of them, generatingdetailed and quantiﬁable information.
•The identiﬁed countermeasures were associated with
the identiﬁed vulnerabilities to solve them, generating amore effective response because the countermeasures
solve the vulnerabilities of all the assets in which they
are present.
As a conclusion, we can indicate that the measurement
of risks using the suggested conceptual model and theAVARCIBER framework has allowed us to have a better
vision of the relationships that the elements of cybersecu-
rity risk management may have. The quantiﬁcation ofassets and vulnerabilities allows improving decision-mak-
ing based on the criticality of the risks and countermea-
sures that must be applied.
The next step in this research work is to implement a
software system that allows the automation of this con-
ceptual model, based on the AVARCIBER framework.
