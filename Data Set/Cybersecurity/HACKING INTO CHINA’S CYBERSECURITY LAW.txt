57 HACKING INTO CHINA’S CYBERSECURITY LAW Jyh-An Lee* China’s Cybersecurity Law, which is thus far the most important internet legislation to be passed in the country, came into effect on June 1, 2017.  The law has attracted significant attention and criticism from foreign companies.  Although the Chinese government claims that the Cybersecurity Law will help reduce the risk of cyberattacks and safeguard national security, some critics believe that the law will further erode internet freedom in China.  In particular, concerns have been raised that the law may not effectively enhance China’s current level of cybersecurity but instead may be used to facilitate government censorship and surveillance, to increase unnecessary business operating costs, to steal intellectual property from foreign companies, and to protect domestic industries from global competition.   This Article provides a thorough analysis of important provisions of the Cybersecurity Law as well as their policy implications.  It views the Cybersecurity Law as part of a broader set of policy steps that have been taken to streamline laws concerning the internet and national security.  The law   *.

This Article contends that the law should be understood from the perspective of China’s unique conception of cybersecurity and human rights.  As cybersecurity is defined much more broadly in China than it is in the Western world, any digital information threatening social or political stability will be viewed as a cybersecurity, or even a national security, concern.  This explains why the scope of the Cybersecurity Law is unprecedented.  Moreover, the treatment of personal information in the Cybersecurity Law reflects China’s human rights philosophy.  While individuals enjoy a certain degree of human rights protection, those rights do not effectively protect them from government action. TABLE OF CONTENTS I.

Such developments echo Chinese President Xi Jinping’s dictum that “without cybersecurity there is no national security.”9 The Standing Committee of China’s National People’s Congress (“NPC”) passed the Cybersecurity Law on November 7, 2016, and it came into effect on June 1, 2017.10  This legislation is the first comprehensive law at the national level to address cybersecurity issues.11  With this new law, the nation-state will have more power to monitor the risks and threats associated with cybersecurity.  Although the Chinese government claims that the law is similar to that of other countries,12 most commentators believe that it is, comparatively, quite unique.13  Seeking comments, the NPC released a first draft of the law in July 2015 and a second draft in June 2016.14  Consequently, more than forty business groups petitioned Premier Li Keqiang in August 2016, urging the government to revise some controversial sections found in the second draft.15  However, the final Cybersecurity Law has been criticized for not adopting any of the substantial comments and criticisms made by private-sector actors—especially foreign businesses—on previous drafts.16  In May 2017, an  Cong., Nov. 7, 2016, effective June 1, 2017), http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/xinwen /2016-11/07/content_2001605.htm [hereinafter Cybersecurity Law].  9.

Part II introduces the background of the Cybersecurity Law, demonstrating how the law has institutionalized China’s longstanding assertion of internet sovereignty under the pretense of protecting cybersecurity.  Moreover, Part II will discuss how the Cybersecurity Law is not a piece of standalone legislation but instead should be viewed as part of the nation-state’s legislative endeavors to strengthen national security.  Together with the Great Firewall, the National Security Law, the Counterterrorism Law, and other internet regulations, the Cybersecurity Law has been crafted as an indispensable foundation for China’s authoritarian control over the internet.  Part III then identifies the major legal issues found within the Cybersecurity Law, which include the obligation of network operators, the defense of critical infrastructure, data localization, security review, and the protection of personal information.  Part IV examines the policy implications and characteristics of the Cybersecurity Law by showing how the law reflects China’s unique approaches to cybersecurity and human rights, which are significantly different from the approaches taken in the Western world.  Further, Part IV will reveal that the law also represents the government’s distrust of the market when it comes to cybersecurity issues and how the overly broad language used in the law remains an unresolved issue for both regulators and industry.  Finally, Part V concludes this Article. II.  BACKGROUND AND FOUNDATION OF THE CYBERSECURITY LAW The Cybersecurity Law does not exist in a vacuum.  The law is a milestone in a series of policy initiatives and legislation aimed at strengthening the protection of national security and cybersecurity in China in recent years.  Therefore, this legislation should be understood alongside other laws—such as the National Security Law and the Counterterrorism Law—and China’s unique internet architecture.  Moreover, the design of the Cybersecurity Law was based on the concept of “cyberspace sovereignty” that shapes China’s overall internet policy and regulations.31  Fears, supra note 7; Arya MM, Will China’s Cyber Security Law Restrict Online Freedom?, INFOTECHLEAD (Nov. 7, 2016), http://www.infotechlead.com/security /will-chinas-cyber-security-law-restrict-online-freedom-43755.  30.

Background of the Cybersecurity Law The United States has identified China as probably the most important digital power in the world in terms of creating national security concerns.32  Both the U.S. government and American businesses have been exposed to Chinese hacking of confidential information.33  Nonetheless, the intelligence leaks from Edward Snowden have shown that the United States has similarly engaged in internet surveillance of multiple nations around the world, including China.34  Obviously, China has also had to cope with national security problems caused by various actions of foreign governments via their intelligence agents.35  Unsurprisingly, China claims that it has been a victim of hack attacks.36  The U.S. intelligence activities disclosed by Snowden are likely a small part of a much bigger threat against China’s national security.  Furthermore, the rapid development of digital technologies in China and the interconnected nature of the internet have also made cybersecurity a national priority for the country.37  President Xi Jinping has therefore emphasized that security is a prerequisite for internet development.38  As a result, in February 2014, the Chinese Communist Party announced the creation of the Cybersecurity and Informatization Leading Group, chaired by President Xi Jinping, in order to address cybersecurity issues.39  The establishment of this group represents   32.

Recently, U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to establish a high-level dialogue mechanism on cybersecurity when they met in Florida in April 2017,42 and the conversation between the two governments is ongoing.43 China has viewed cybersecurity as a national security issue44 and the Cybersecurity Law bears witness to the Chinese government’s continuous legislative effort to strengthen its national security.  The recent legislative wave regarding national security in China started with the National Security Law, promulgated on July 1, 2015,45 which provides the government with broad authority to implement a system for cybersecurity.  Concerns have been raised by critics that the law may be used to crack down on peaceful expression.46  While the main function of the National Security Law is to provide a legal framework to respond to emerging threats to national security,47 it is similar to the Cybersecurity Law in that both laws have empowered the government to monitor and control the flow of information and have increased scrutiny of foreign technologies.48  Furthermore, both laws stress the concept of cyberspace sovereignty, which China has  with cybersecurity); Lindsay, supra note 32, at 17; Stephen Chen, Xi Jinping Heads New Panel on Internet Security and Promoting IT, SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST (Feb. 28, 2014, 4:57 AM), http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1436747 /xi-jinping-heads-new-panel-internet-security-and-promoting-it; MM, supra note 29 (stating that, “[s]ince Edward Snowden’s revelations about U.S. spying, China has become more aggressive about its cyber security”).  40.

Cyberspace Sovereignty Cyberspace sovereignty, sometimes referred to as “internet sovereignty,”59 “network sovereignty,”60 or “cyber sovereignty,”61 has become a fundamental principle in China’s Cybersecurity Law and other internet-related policies.62  Article 1 of the Cybersecurity Law makes clear that the law’s legislative purpose is “to protect cybersecurity; to safeguard cyberspace sovereignty, national security, and the societal public interest; to protect the lawful rights and interests of citizens, legal persons, and other organizations; and to promote the healthy development of economic and social informatization.”63  The law unequivocally approaches cybersecurity concerns as a threat to sovereignty and national security.64 Conventional wisdom dictates that there are no borders in cyberspace;65 therefore, there should be no sovereignty in cyberspace.  Nonetheless, Article 1 of the law clearly claims that one of its main purposes is to “safeguard cyberspace sovereignty.”66  In fact, the Cybersecurity Law is not the first Chinese law or government statement claiming the nation’s cyberspace sovereignty.  The Chinese State Council Information Office released a white paper entitled “The Internet in China” in 2010 outlining China’s internet policy,67 which was the first document of its kind.

The Internet sovereignty of China should be respected and protected.  Citizens of the People’s Republic of China and foreign citizens, legal persons and other organizations within Chinese territory have the right and freedom to use the Internet; at the same time, they must obey the laws and regulations of China and conscientiously protect Internet security.68 The National Security Law enacted in 2015 further stressed that the state should “maintain cyberspace sovereignty” by “strengthening network management [and] preventing, stopping, and lawfully punishing illegal and criminal internet activities, including cyberattacks, network hacking, cybertheft, and dissemination of unlawful and harmful information.”69 Whether nation-states possess sovereignty over cyberspace is debatable.  Nonetheless, a nation-state certainly possesses sovereignty over both its domestic network70 and the cyber infrastructure located within its territory.71  Governments can thus put the idea of cyberspace sovereignty into practice by leveraging internet infrastructure configurations within their territories.  Therefore, from a regulatory perspective, the internet and its governance are far from borderless.72  This outlook is exactly how China’s Cybersecurity Law regulates cyberspace, as a significant part of the law concerns the regulation of domestic internet operators and critical infrastructure.73  In fact, China has built borders for cyberspace within its internet architecture—i.e., the Great Firewall—which has effectively facilitated the filtering and blocking of foreign online content.74  President Xi Jinping and the Chinese government   68.

MAIN LEGAL ISSUES In addition to institutionalizing some longstanding internet policies and government practices in China,82 the Cybersecurity Law also establishes certain national mechanisms to protect cybersecurity.  This Part examines key legal issues in the Cybersecurity Law, which include the legal obligations of network operators, the defense of critical infrastructure, the data localization requirement, security inspection and review, and the protection of personal information. A. Network Operators Intermediaries, such as ISPs, search engines, and social media outlets, have been targeted by nation-states to enforce their internet regulations.83  The Cybersecurity Law continues China’s current practice of implementing internet regulations on intermediaries.84  Intermediaries, especially ISPs, play an important role in censoring and blocking unwanted foreign websites.85  Unsurprisingly, the Cybersecurity Law also imposes significant obligations on intermediaries—namely, network operators, critical information infrastructure operators, and suppliers of network products and services.86   81.

However, this also means that, by cooperating with government authorities, network operators may expose their data to a higher risk of leakage.  Concerns have been raised that government agencies may mandate internet companies to provide access or decryption assistance to obtain users’ confidential information101 even without a warrant, subpoena, or any type of court order.102  Network operators may arguably be required to create backdoors within their product for the government to access their data accordingly.103  Similar concerns were raised when China passed the Counterterrorism Law, which likewise requires   94.

Internet companies in other jurisdictions may also cooperate with governments to provide decryption assistance or backdoor access to personal data for law enforcement purposes.106  Unfortunately, the Cybersecurity Law neither limits the government’s law enforcement power to only what is strictly necessary nor provides other guidelines concerning under what circumstances government agencies can enforce this provision for the purposes of national security.107 B. Critical Infrastructure “Critical infrastructure” refers to the facilities, systems, and networks that are socially and economically crucial to the functioning of a country in terms of how goods or services provided therein are essential to national security, economic vitality, and citizen health and safety.108  Critical infrastructure covers a wide variety of sectors, including agriculture, food, water, energy, health, communications, transportation, financial systems, etc.109  Since critical infrastructure is vital to a nation’s survival,110 then-President Barack Obama declared critical infrastructure to be a “strategic national asset.”111   104.

The protection of critical infrastructure has been an essential element of China’s cybersecurity strategy since 2003 and continues to be central to the country’s current cybersecurity policy.118  The Cybersecurity Law further aims to answer one of the most difficult policy questions in terms of protecting critical infrastructure: “[W]ho is responsible for what?”119  Article 31 of China’s Cybersecurity Law elucidates how critical information infrastructure120 includes, but is not limited to, public communication and information services, energy, transportation, water conservation, banking and finance, public services, and electronic government.121  The same provision defines “critical information infrastructure” as that which, if   112.

Because of such heavy obligations imposed on critical information infrastructure by the new law, most companies are reluctant to be considered critical information infrastructure operators.129  Moreover, the ambiguous language used in Article 31, especially the phrases “people’s livelihood” and “public interest,”130 has created significant   122.

Critical information infrastructure operators are a subset of network operators that bear more obligations than typical network operators.  Pursuant to Article 34, these operators have the obligation to conduct security background checks on responsible personnel in critical positions, carry out cybersecurity education and technical training, and implement disaster recovery backups.131  Critical information infrastructure operators are also required to conduct inspections of their network security on at least an annual basis.132  Breaches of these duties may lead to critical information infrastructure operators being fined between RMB 100,000 and 1,000,000 (approximately $15,920 and $159,150, respectively), and the management personnel directly responsible may face fines between RMB 10,000 and 100,000 (approximately $1,590 and $15,920, respectively).133 There is no question that the private sector’s cooperation and precautions are crucial to ensuring any country’s cybersecurity.134  However, how to best enable such measures in the private sector has been more difficult to determine in terms of cybersecurity policymaking.  From a comparative perspective, because of congressional inaction, President Obama issued Executive Order 13,636 to facilitate public-private information sharing regarding the protection of critical infrastructure and to establish the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Framework, which includes best practices for the private sector to secure critical infrastructure.135  The NIST Framework consists of some overarching cybersecurity risk management principles that do not focus on a particular sector or entity.136  Different from China’s Cybersecurity Law, private critical infrastructure operators and owners do not have the legal duty to follow the NIST Framework.137  Instead, these best practices are adopted on a voluntary basis.138   131.

The Chinese Cybersecurity Law has created hefty obligations for private critical information infrastructure operators139 that are too broadly defined.140  This mandatory approach may create unnecessary compliance costs for a wide range of enterprises.  However, the United States’ voluntary approach is not without its flaws.  Critics of the U.S. approach highlight that private enterprises are not sufficiently incentivized to take appropriate measures to protect critical infrastructure from cyberattacks141 that will ultimately threaten national security.142  As a result, some commentators doubt whether the voluntary scheme will be implemented effectively in order to protect cybersecurity associated with critical infrastructure.143  Although the U.S. government once tried to develop a public-private partnership approach—charging the North American Electronic Reliability Corporation (“NERC”) with developing and enforcing mandatory cybersecurity standards through collaboration with players in the electricity market—the model has not been successful.144  Therefore, the most effective domestic regulatory approach to protecting critical infrastructure has yet to be developed.  during litigation or a regulatory investigation, the ‘standard’ for ‘due diligence’ [is] now the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.”).  139.

Data Localization “Data localization” typically refers to policies requiring companies to store data on users but only on servers within jurisdictional borders.145  For example, certain countries—namely, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Russia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom—all require financial data within a certain scope to be stored locally.146  Some, including Australia and the United Kingdom, require health records to be stored within their borders.147  Data localization is an important feature of China’s Cybersecurity Law as it is based on the national government’s claim to cyberspace sovereignty148 and the assertion that requiring data to stay within the country’s borders provides a higher level of security and protection.149  Through data localization, governments can also more easily claim jurisdiction and exert control over data.150  Although the protection of privacy and cybersecurity and the freedom from foreign surveillance are proclaimed as the policy goals of data localization,151 it is also common for governments to implement such policies as a tool to support local data center industries or to facilitate domestic surveillance or law enforcement.152  As a result, while data localization may not substantively increase the level of cybersecurity,   145.

Their first concern is that it creates considerable costs in terms of data management.160  Multinational enterprises store their data on the cloud with servers in different jurisdictions to mitigate various efficiency, cost, or tax concerns.161  Some companies even avoid physically locating their servers within the borders of repressive regimes, such as China, in   153.

Jack Ma of Alibaba once complained that data localization regulations create a “major problem[] for Chinese internet companies expanding overseas . . . ultimately leading to the fragmentation of cyberspace.”172  This worry has been confirmed by recent internet law scholarship showing that the data localization policy may lead to the “Balkanization of the Internet” by fundamentally changing the internet architecture that has, until now, facilitated universal connectivity and the free flow of information.173  Therefore, some commentators believe that the data localization provision in the Cybersecurity Law will hobble globalization efforts made by China’s primary internet companies—namely, the “BAT” triopoly of Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent.174   169.

Some multinational enterprises worry that the mandate will enable the Chinese government to access their proprietary information or trade secrets.175  Also, companies are more vulnerable to government censorship and surveillance, which will ultimately threaten the privacy of their users.176  Moreover, aggregating data in one location or jurisdiction may render it more susceptible to hacking attacks.177  As a result, data localization may harm, rather than strengthen, cybersecurity. A minor criticism of the data localization provision found in Article 37 is that, although the law defines “personal information,”178 it does not define what constitutes “important data.”179  While the CAC defines “important data” as “data closely related to national security, economic development, and social public interest,”180 it is quite possible that the government may define “national security, economic development, and social public interest” at its own discretion and consequently create enormous costs for business to comply with the data localization obligation.  In addition, Article 37 contains no substantive definition of “security assessment”181 and a relevant procedure for such an assessment has yet to be announced by the government. In response to the concerns highlighted above, the Chinese government has indicated that data localization is not intended to hinder globalization under the One-Belt-One-Road initiative.182  Zhao Zeliang of the CAC has made it clear that data localization will not block the transnational flow of data but will remind regulators and businesses of the risks associated with cross-border data transfers.183  However, given the severe penalties attached to the data localization requirement in the Cybersecurity Law,184 it is reasonable to expect   175.

It will be worth observing how the Chinese government will trade off its policy goal of data localization while maintaining its global technological ambitions. D. Security Certification, Inspection, and Review Cybersecurity can be ensured only when critical information infrastructure operators and other network operators adopt products and services that meet certain security standards.  Therefore, determining which standards should be adopted has been a crucial issue in cybersecurity policy.  China developed a set of cybersecurity standards in 2007 in the Regulations on Classified Protection of Information Security, which are referred to as the Multiple-Level Protection Scheme (“MLPS”).185  Nevertheless, the MLPS was criticized as being inconsistent with international cybersecurity standards and described as little more than protectionist measures to guard domestic companies from global competition.186 The Cybersecurity Law includes a complicated security certification, inspection, and review regime.  Article 23 stipulates that critical network equipment and specialized network security products shall follow the national standards and mandatory requirements, with the security level certified by a qualified institute or confirmed by security inspection.187  The provision further requires that the state’s network information departments, together with the relevant departments of the State Council, to formulate and release a catalog of critical network equipment and specialized network security products as well as promote the reciprocal recognition of security certifications and security inspection results to avoid duplicative certifications and inspections.188 Under Article 35, network products and services purchased by critical information infrastructure operators that might affect national security are required to undergo a national security review by the government.189  The obligations imposed by Articles 23 and 35 are evidently onerous and time-consuming.  In order to implement Article 35, the CAC released the Measures on the Security Review of Network Products and Services (Interim)—also referred to as the “Interim Measures”—on May 2, 2017.190  According to the Interim Measures, the CAC will establish a committee to conduct the security reviews,191 and the focus of such reviews will be on whether the   185.

The purpose of these regulations is to reduce cybersecurity threats or, more specifically, to prevent products and services from being manipulated by foreign forces.199  China believes that its digital network will be more vulnerable to cyberattacks if its components are manufactured by foreign firms.200  Nonetheless, the Interim Measures have been criticized as being unclear in their “substantive criteria and procedure” as related to the security review process.201  Undoubtedly, a comprehensive security inspection regime may enable ubiquitous digital surveillance.202  Companies have expressed concern that mandated security inspection, certification, and review may create more opportunities for the leakage of trade secrets and other confidential information regarding information security.203  The Office of the United States Trade Representative raised similar concerns in its 2017 Special 301 Report, specifically that companies may be obliged to disclose proprietary intellectual property to comply with the security review requirement.204  Furthermore, the security certification, inspection, and review requirements in Articles 23 and 35 may inappropriately intervene in the market, as each of these requirements may be used for political purposes to delay or block market access to industries that are defined as critical information   198.

For example, as mentioned previously, network operators are obliged to provide technical support and assistance to public security authorities and state security authorities for the purposes of lawfully upholding national security and investigating crimes.223  This obligation has exposed personal data held by network operators to a high risk of leakage.224  If governments can legally mandate that network products and service providers build backdoors into hardware and software, or provide access to these backdoors,225 the risk of privacy infringement will increase even more significantly.  Similarly, network operators’ obligation to store network logs for at least six months226 also threatens the protection of personal information.  While data retention regulations are increasingly common,227 and most international internet companies retain identifying user log data for the purposes of law enforcement,228 the six-month retention period in the Cybersecurity Law will certainly generate considerable costs for network operators—especially small companies.229  Moreover, all log retention policies or regulations will impact users’ privacy because their personal information will be exposed to a higher risk of leakage.230   220.

EVALUATION OF THE CYBERSECURITY LAW The Cybersecurity Law presents China’s regulatory approach to cybersecurity and digital human rights and reflects the nation-state’s distrust in the market’s approach cybersecurity and national security.  The vague language the law employs has created great uncertainty for the industry and given interpretive flexibility to regulators.  This Part provides an overall policy analysis and evaluation of the Cybersecurity Law to illustrate China’s unique perception of cybersecurity. A. The Chinese Version of Cybersecurity The Cybersecurity Law covers a broad range of industries that occasionally fall outside of the internet and information security industries.239  The data and information subject to regulatory control are also wide-ranging.240  Moreover, concerns have been raised that the government may use the law and the notion of cybersecurity to   231.

One may argue that the Chinese government actually intends to use the new law to fulfill its political agenda rather than protect its cybersecurity.  However, the far-reaching scope of the Cybersecurity Law can also be explained by recognizing how China’s conception of cybersecurity differs from that of the Western world.  The Western idea of cybersecurity places a greater emphasis on technical threats, whereas the Chinese notion of cybersecurity prioritizes ideological threats.244  In addition to the security of networks and information systems, China’s cybersecurity policy also covers censorship and “properly guiding Internet opinion.”245  The inclusive view of cybersecurity is essential to understanding China’s approach to relevant legislation and policy.  The country’s unique regulatory mindset explains why President Xi Jinping has associated cybersecurity with a healthy internet culture.246  In a white paper published by China’s State Council Information Office in 2010, the government asserted that among its policy goals in protecting cybersecurity—or internet information security—is to eliminate all online content that can be described as being against the cardinal principles set forth in the Constitution; endangering state security, divulging state secrets, subverting state power and jeopardizing national unification; damaging state honor and interests; instigating ethnic hatred or discrimination and jeopardizing ethnic unity;   241.

B. Market Intervention The Chinese government’s regulation of market activities has also been a focus of internet law scholarship.267  China’s Great Firewall has notably intervened in the online market by blocking foreign internet services provided by Google, Facebook, YouTube, and other multinational internet companies.268  The Chinese government has further expressed its strong will to intervene in the market through many of the Cybersecurity Law’s provisions.  For example, the data localization requirement prevents critical information infrastructure operators from using more efficient cloud services that store data abroad.269  Some researchers argue that the data localization rule actually decreases cybersecurity because when companies’ storage options are limited to choosing local storage services or building their own, they lose the opportunity to deploy the most secure storage services that have survived global competition.270 The same argument can be applied to cybersecurity standards primarily developed or decided by the government.  As leading cybersecurity companies, such as Kaspersky and Symantec, are not allowed to sell their products to financial institutions and critical information infrastructure operators, China has become more vulnerable to cyberattacks.271  Some other commentators suggest that the government should not intervene in the market on cybersecurity issues because the private sector has more agility and knowledge to enhance cybersecurity.272  The same argument can also be used to criticize the security certification, inspection, and review provisions in the Cybersecurity Law, which stipulate that the government has the power to decide which cybersecurity products and services are  Communist Party ideals are not directly or indirectly challenged by impure thoughts”).  266.

Although the market can usually provide an ideal solution, sometimes the law still needs to intervene.  The point here is to question why the law needs to respond in some situations.274  The justification for government intervention in the Cybersecurity Law may be that although critical information infrastructure operators need to satisfy the market demand for cybersecurity, their expectations of the level of cybersecurity is occasionally lower than that of the government.  In other words, while businesses should be keen to protect their networks and confidential information from cyberattacks, they evaluate the factors that affect the level of cybersecurity differently than governments do.  After all, cybersecurity in the business context is not always equal to that at the national security level.275  Investment in cybersecurity may occasionally become costly and lead to nonproductive assets, which in turn will not yield any profit.276  Consequently, businesses sometimes fail to seek higher levels of cybersecurity because of cost, profit, or other commercial concerns.277  Such compromises could create considerable risks in terms of national security.  Moreover, although cloud computing can save businesses from paying enormous data storage costs, from a technical perspective, cloud storage is vulnerable to a variety of cybersecurity threats associated with hacking.278  Lastly, as mentioned previously, the government may use security certification, inspection, and review to block foreign companies’ access   273.

After all, even U.S. cybersecurity expert James A. Lewis believes that “[t]he market has failed to secure cyberspace.”283 Nevertheless, the government may also fail to achieve its policy goals because of its inability to acquire sufficient information to make decisions.284  The Cybersecurity Law has given the government the freedom to decide which products and services satisfy cybersecurity requirements and determine the ideal standards on which to base those decisions.285  However, whether the government has the expertise to make such decisions is unclear.286  Additionally, the government may not be fully aware of the costs borne by the private sector as a result of the data localization requirement because those costs are not imposed on the government itself.  Under the Cybersecurity Law, the government does not need to change its data storage practices because it only stores its data within the territory.287  By contrast, data localization will be extremely costly for the private sector.288  This side effect of government intervention is one of the so-called “derived externalities.”289  These potential government failures   279.

A proposal by the White House provides a plausible alternative to China’s government-centric approach to security certification and inspection.291  In June 2015, the Obama administration announced the #CyberUL initiative to develop a product security standard based on the prominent Underwriters Laboratories (“UL”) model that has already been widely adopted in various industries.292  UL is known for its reliable service in auditing and inspecting products and issuing certificates endorsing its security standard.293  This approach may not only mitigate the government’s weaknesses mentioned above294 but also alleviate the potential for market failure resulting from private companies’ inadequate incentives to acquire products that meet the appropriate cybersecurity standard.  Nevertheless, given the lack of a reputable neutral party like UL, and the Chinese government’s insistent and strict control over the internet,295 it is unsurprising that the new law grants the monopoly on conducting security certification, inspection, and review to the government.296  Although the Chinese government has embarked on an initiative to develop its own standards for cybersecurity, such as the MLPS,297 whether these standards will effectively help China protect its cybersecurity is presently unclear. C.

The vagueness of the language used in the Cybersecurity Law implies that the government may intend to use it as a tool to control industries.  Some commentators believe that, similar to many other laws and regulations in China, the vague Cybersecurity Law was designed to give the authorities more flexibility and leeway to interpret and implement it.305  For example, the authorities in charge may apply a case-by-case approach to interpreting the law.306  The worst-case scenario would be that the law is enforced to engage in selective persecution.  Regulators may harshly enforce the law against disobedient people or companies who have become a thorn in the side of the nation-state.307  Therefore, a more fundamental concern in terms of the new law is probably not the vagueness of its language but, rather, the fact that the country has few democratic checks and balances.308  That creates an enormous gray area for law enforcement. Given the Cybersecurity Law’s ambiguity, it will take time for internet companies to observe and begin to understand how the government intends to enforce the law.

D. Digital Human Rights with Chinese Characteristics Cybersecurity concerns some fundamental human rights.  Consequently, scholars have proposed that human rights implications should be included in the cybersecurity dialogue between China and the United States.312  China is notorious for its human rights violations.313  However, it would be naïve to argue that it does not protect human rights at all.  Domestically, human rights have been entrenched in China’s constitution since 1982.314  In 2004, the constitution was amended to provide expressly that “the state respects and [safeguards] human rights.”315  Internationally, China voted together with the United States in favor of the 2012 United Nations Human Rights Council resolution to protect the free speech of individuals on the internet, which directly addressed the right to freedom of expression and opinion on the internet.316  Although China has made some progress in its human rights protections, its approaches to human rights have reflected values and mentalities   310.

Take privacy or protection of personal information as examples.  As mentioned previously, although the law provides citizens with unprecedented protection of their data privacy, it also creates numerous opportunities for the government or third parties to infringe upon citizens’ privacy.320  Why does the law take such a seemly inconsistent or parallel approach to privacy by protecting and risking privacy simultaneously?  This Article argues this occurrence can be explained by the fact that the fundamentals of China’s human rights are different from those of the Western world.  In the Western world, human rights were designed to protect individuals from state power since the beginning.321  However, China has viewed human rights as derived from the state, which reigns supreme over the individual.322  Therefore, human rights are never considered to represent an individual’s rights over those of the Chinese state. By this logic, it is not difficult to understand why, under the Cybersecurity Law, network operators are obliged to provide   317. Cf.

Similarly, China has developed an increasingly sophisticated approach to free speech, taking into account the free flow of information, an individual’s reputation, privacy, and the nature of social media.324  Nevertheless, political speech against the government is still highly controlled,325 and the exercise of human rights is not permitted to threaten the regime or social stability.326  While the government has endeavored to continuously enhance the human rights protection it offers, the actions of the state government itself is mostly unconstrained by fundamental human rights.327 Human rights philosophy has also influenced the structure and function of the Chinese government.  In Western democracies, human rights protection is ensured through checks and balances.328  This checks-and-balances mechanism plays a critical role in balancing national security with human rights.329  Comparatively, while government surveillance for law enforcement or national security purposes is also common in other jurisdictions, the implementation of such surveillance is usually subject to various levels of scrutiny in order to balance different interests, especially those concerning criminal investigations, national security, privacy, and civic   323.

As a result, the Cybersecurity Law provides various provisions that enable the government’s surveillance and control over information without substantial constraint.333 Apple’s dispute with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) in the United States also provides a good example illustrating the differences in the human rights philosophy promoted by the Western world in comparison to that of China.

The Chinese government can request that companies provide access to personal information or decryption assistance to access such information without the need for a court order.339  In sum, the Cybersecurity Law perpetuates China’s human rights practice of prioritizing government supremacy. V.  CONCLUSION The Cybersecurity Law is a milestone in China’s laws and policies regarding the internet.  The law not only reflects China’s increasingly strict governance of the internet but also reveals China’s attempts to assert its internet sovereignty and shows that the country is taking cybersecurity issues more seriously now than ever.  The law reaffirms China’s intention to dictate the regulation of its own cyberspace and provides the government with the legal facades with which to identify and mitigate the online behaviors that it deems unacceptable.  While it is common for governments to impose restrictions on the private sector when there are cybersecurity concerns, China has decided to take a more militant and draconian approach than most other countries. Under the new Cybersecurity Law, network operators—especially those in the category of critical information infrastructure operators—are burdened with hefty legal obligations to protect cybersecurity.340  Different from the United States’ voluntary policy, the Cybersecurity Law adopts a mandatory approach to protect critical infrastructure.341  Both voluntary and mandatory approaches have their respective advantages and disadvantages.  China’s Cybersecurity Law will test whether the mandatory approach is effective and sustainable in terms of protecting critical infrastructure.  Data localization is one of the most cumbersome duties borne by critical information infrastructure operators, and it is unclear whether such data localization can adequately protect cybersecurity in the long run.  However, the data localization policy does expose enterprises to more risks associated with local government   337.

Although its protection of citizens’ data privacy is unprecedented, the Cybersecurity Law also grants the government significant power to access personal information which could possibly be leaked. This Article argues that the Cybersecurity Law should be understood from the perspective of China’s unique conception of cybersecurity, which is much broader than the Western world’s definition.  In China, cybersecurity encompasses content control for the purposes of maintaining social and political stability.  Furthermore, the Cybersecurity Law’s treatment of personal information and privacy mirrors China’s perceptions of human rights: human rights are protected under the law, but they must yield to government power.  Government supremacy is an essential part of Chinese human rights philosophy.  This explains why the Cybersecurity Law extends an unprecedented level of protection to privacy while also providing the government with unparalleled power to control and surveil the personal information held by various network operators.
