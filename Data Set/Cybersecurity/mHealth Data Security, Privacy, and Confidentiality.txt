    mHealth Data Security, Privacy, and Co nfidentiality Guidelines       vii PREFACE  
Information technology is spreading fast , and its adoption in the health sector is gaining ground  rapidly . 
Under the banner of eHealth, mHealth , or digital health, mobile technology (such as laptop computers, 
mobile phones, and tablets ) has become an indispensable tool to  increase  health coverage.  As countries 
strive toward universal health coverage, mobile wireless technologies —mHealth to ols—in support of 
enumeration, registration , and unique identification  of patients , along with  maintenance of health records , 
will facilitate improved health system performance. Electronic forms and registry systems will enable 
routine monitoring of the co verage of essential interventions for individuals in relevant populations . 
Because mobile technology is widespread,  governments and organizations are harnessing their power to 
collect, collate, transmit , and present data in a timely fashion, thereby overco ming barriers inherent in 
paper -based systems. The rapid progression of technology enables the increased sharing of data between 
electronic systems. This can provide decision makers  with valuable data and improve  their ability to make 
critical decisions  on health programs.  
As healthcare organizations turn to mobile devices to improve efficiency and productivity, many are 
introducing risks that could all too easily result in a data breach and the exposure of protected health 
informat ion. Organizations aro und the world are taking note and providing guidelines on how to 
safeguard electronic personal health information (ePHI) . 
Building the infrastructure to safeguard ePHI is an evolving area. High -income countries have not found 
a lasting solution to this pro blem, much less the low - and middle -income countries (LMICs). Technology 
is changing so fast that keeping up with all the issues of security and privacy is daunting. LMICs lack 
national and comprehensive instruments such as laws and guidelines to protect t he data -rich digital health 
sector. A few high -income countries have established laws and policies for healthcare data privacy and 
confidentiality from which other countries can learn.  
Privacy generally refers to patients having substantial control over the extent, timing, circumstances, and 
sharing of information about oneself with others (Golstin, et al., 2003). Confidentiality refers to the 
treatment of identifiable information that has been disclosed to others in relation of trust and with the 
expecta tion that it will not be divulged to others except in previously agreed -upon ways. Protecting  a 
person ’s health information is particularly important for sensitive health issues such as HIV and for 
stigmatized populations that are at elevated levels of acq uiring sexually transmitted diseases, including 
HIV.  
In its October 2017 Cybersecurity Newsletter, the United States  Department of Health and Human 
Services Office for Civil Rights reminded insured  entities of the risks associated with mobile devices that 
are used to create, receive, maintain, or transmit ePHI. Entities covered by the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability  Act were reminded of the need to conduct an organization -wide risk 
assessment and develop a risk management plan to address all  mobile device security risks identified 
during the risk analysis and reduce them to an appropriate and acceptable level.  Although  many covered 
entities allow the use of mobile devices, some prohibit the use of those devices to create, receive, 
maintain, o r transmit ePHI.  These risks are not specific to the United States; d ata breach incidents 
continue to plague healthcare organizations  around the world. The potential cost to the healthcare 
industry could be as much as $5.6 billion annually (Patrick, 2014).  Often these devices  are also  used for 
personal digital activities , such as calling, texting, playing games, taking photos, web browsing, e -mailing, 
and accessing social media. Given that mobile devices are not always connected to secure Internet , these viii      mHealth Data Security, Privacy, and Confidentiality Guidelines  personal activities may inadvertently expose the device to viral attacks and other security risks , leading to 
data breaches. In addition, d ue to their portability, mobile devices are susceptible to breakage, loss, and 
theft. Cyber -attacks  are also increasi ngly common, especially targeting sensitive health data stored on 
digital health systems  (Goldman, 2017; Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology , 2016) .  
The media are increasingly reporting instances of breaches in the security of large amounts of 
electronically stored personal data . Attracted by both the sensitivity and utility of health data, hackers are 
always devising new ways to gain access . They exploit vulnerabilities in the software, device , or data 
transmission channels, sometimes with fa r-reaching ramifications.  If health services data are stolen, clients 
can be expose d to social or economic risks  and their  trust in those services would diminish . In addition, if 
data are compromised, health managers may be making decisions based on inaccu rate data. Countries and 
programs must therefore continuously review and tighten their technology tools, rules , and regulations to 
protect patients’ health data.  
International law recognizes the individual right to privacy. Privacy  is a basic human right. For example, 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights 
and Fundamental Freedoms acknowledge the individual right to privacy. Many countries have privacy 
laws, either as omnibus data protection regulation such as the European laws  or general personal data 
protection laws. These kinds of laws give equal weight to all types of personal data. The U.S. laws are 
different; they are more specific and are categorized by different sectors , ensuring that protection 
measures of certain types of data are more stringent  (Trustlaw Connect , et al., 2013 ). In fact, the United 
States has enacted laws to protect health and medical data through the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act . LMICs  have exp ressed interest in establishing data protection regulations , but few 
have enacted such mechanisms. The countries that have enacted these kinds of protections are Kenya, 
Mauritius, Morocco , and South Africa  (Trust Law Connect , et al., 2013).  Many other count ries have ethical 
codes of practice for medical workers who come into contact with privileged patient information.  The 
World Health Organization’s 1994  Declaration on Promotion of Patients’ Rights recognizes a patient’s 
right to privacy.  
To understand  and frame  the digital health landscape  issues of personal health information  privacy and 
confidentiality , particularly in an mHealth environment , MEASURE Evaluation, with funding from the 
United States Agency  for International Development , conducted a landscape analysis . Its result s are 
reported  in mHealth for Low - and Middle -Income Countries —Challenges and Opportunities in Data Quality, Privacy, 
and Security report (Wambugu & Villella, 2016) . The landscape analysis was conducted in two countries  
(Kenya  and Tanzania ), but the results broadly portray the situation of LMICs, especially in the African 
region. The main objective of that analysis was to help understand the  data security and privacy practices  
and the preparedness of countries  in the sub -Sahara n region to tackle emerging data ethics  issues. Th is 
landscape  analysis was supplemented by a review of gray and peer -reviewed literature on this subject . The 
findings were telling. They  show that digital systems are nascent but developing fast , and there is need for 
strong leadership for national health information systems  (HIS) to establish or improv e existing 
governance mechanisms. In addition,  standard operating procedures  were commonly cited as tools that 
countries need to guide issues of data security  and privacy  (Wambugu & Villella, 2016) .  
The landscape analysis report recommended  develop ing data security, privacy , and confidentiality 
guideline s that HIS managers and policymakers can use to guide their digital health work . That’s why  we 
developed this document : mHealth Data Security, Privacy, and Confidentiality : Guidelines  for Implementers and 
Policymakers , and its companion checklist, which is available here: 
https://www.measureevaluation.org/resources/publications/ms -17-125b .   mHealth Data Security, Privacy, and Co nfidentiality Guidelines       ix In develop ing these guidelines  over the course of a year , we reviewed the landscape analysis report ; 
searched and analyzed additional gr ay and peer -reviewed  literature ; spoke with subject matter experts ; 
and, in line with the Principles for Digital Development, engaged with country advisory teams in Kenya 
and Ghana. Ghana was included , because we intended to leverage other MEASURE  Evaluation  work in 
the countr y and assess that country’s interest in having the guidelines.  
mHealth technology comprises  many layers that can affect  data security, privacy , and confidentiality 
throughout the data life  cycle . These layers include national and organizational policy; te chnology used in 
data collection, management, storage , and use; as well as user behavior. Each layer require s careful 
analysis to identify  and protect  potential vulnerabilities. The sensitivity of health data requires that the 
developers of mobile apps for  health should build systems that have a secure back -end database; keep 
minimal or no personal health information data on the device ; and ensure that the hardware, software , 
and communication channels between the device and other systems are secure.  
These guidelines are meant to help mHealth program managers  and ministry of health officials  
systematically address mHealth data privacy and security  issues. For each of the layers  of technology , 
these guidelines explore  common vulnerabilities  and propose ways to proactively address them to reduce 
possibilities of data breaches.  
The guidelines also address overarching topics , such as national data leadership and governance , user 
behavior , and training. Other topics are technology -specific , such as mobile d evices (hardware), operating 
systems, applications, networks , and data storage.  To demonstrate how elements described in these 
guidelines  have been applied in programs , two case studies are included. In addition, a n accompanying  
checklist provides users wi th a structured mechanism to assess the strengths and gaps of each of the 
mHealth components.  
These guidelines and the corresponding checklist are meant to be implemented at the national , 
subnational,  or program level , and they are public goods  that count ries and organizations  can use to 
strengthen the security, privacy , and confidentiality of  their respective mHealth  programs  and national 
HIS. Like most other tools in the digital health space, these guidelines are living documents. They will 
undergo regular updates based on new lessons  and to keep them attuned to the ever-evolving  health and 
technology ecosystem.    mHealth Data Security, Privacy, and Co nfidentiality Guidelines       1 INTRODUCTION  
What is the purpose of these guidelines ? 
These  guidelines are intended to strengthen national HIS , by providing a tool to guide decision s on 
security , privacy , and confidentiality of personal health information ( PHI) collected a nd managed using 
mobile devices.  
Who is the audience for these guidelines ? 
These guidelines are intended for  nongovernmental  mHealth program managers as well as ministry of 
health policymakers  and HIS officers  who use mHealth programs . Each group will use the guidelines  
differently , depending on their level of  operation in the health system , priorities , and needs . This list of 
intended audiences is not comprehensive. As the use of mHealth increases, the audience for these 
guidelines  could expand . It is also important to note that the guidelines are not “one size fits all.” They  
are intended to be adapted to meet the specific needs of programs and countries.  
Table 1. Intended audiences for the guidelines  
Nongovernmental Organizations  
mHealth program managers:  mHealth  program managers are responsible for overseeing the design, 
development, deployment, and implementation of a wide range of mHealth programs. These 
guidelines specifically focus on security, privacy, and confidentiality aspects of data management, 
so mHeal th program managers will find them useful for thinking through how to safeguard data that 
are collected on mobile devices and stored in the mHealth ecosystem.  
Ministry of Health  
HIS officers:  HIS officers are responsible for supporting the health information management system of 
the country. This includes managing staff, building staff capacity, and developing HIS guidelines  and 
quality improvement protocols. HIS managers will find these guidelines useful for building capacity of 
staff whose responsibilities include  overseeing data security, privacy, and confidentiality; maintaining 
the security, privacy, and confidentiality o f patient data; and integrating guidelines in national HIS 
frameworks.  
Policymakers:  Although the position will vary from country to country, HIS officials, health information 
leads, or information communication technology managers of ministries of health are responsible for 
overseeing digital health assets and programs, as well as outlining national strategy related to digital 
health. These ministry officials will find these guidelines useful for building the capacity of their 
department to oversee the sec urity, privacy, and confidentiality of mHealth programs in the country. 
They can also use these guidelines to direct  mHealth implementers o n how to increase the security, 
privacy, and confidentiality of their mHealth programs.  
These guidelines are limite d in scope, because their goal is  not to transform a ministry official or an 
mHealth program manager into an expert on digital data security. The guidelines , instead , can serve as a 
building block that will  allow stakeholders to be informed managers of a team responsible for developing 
and implementing responsible data practices, especially data security and privacy.  
  2      mHealth Data Security, Privacy, and Confidentiality Guidelines  What are security, privacy, and confidentiality?  
Security, privacy , and confidentiality ar e interrelated, but there are distinctions between the terms , as 
follows:   
• Security  refers to the technology infrastructure that protect s sensitive information . 
• Privacy  refers to the client’s right to control what “individually identifiable health  informat ion” is 
collected, used , and shared  (HealthIT.gov, 2016) . 
• Confidentiality  refers to the obligation to keep sensitive information private . It is a mechanism 
for protecting privacy.  
What information is  contained in these guidelines?  
These guidelines are built on the premise that securing technology, improving the skills of technology 
users , and establishing a supportive environment can  improve protection  of sensitive client data from  
malicious or inadvertent  access . They f ocus on the intersection between  security,  privacy , and 
confidentiality for mHealth programs. Figure 1 provides  a visual representation of the scope of these 
guidelines.  
Figure 1. Overlaps between mHealth data security, privacy , and confidentiality  
 
In addition, t hese guidelines  focus  on mHealth programs that collect personal health data, which are 
also referred to as “sensitive data .” Consequently , mHealth programs that focus on behavior change 
communication and eLearning  are beyond the scope of these guidelines , unless they collect sensitive data 
from their users . 
The primary  assumption  of these guidelines  is that , by strengthening technological, administrative , and 
physical safeguards surrounding mobile devices, sensitiv e personal health data are also more likely to be 
kept both private and confidential. The  authors acknowledge that provider behavior  outside the mobile 
technology ecosystem also contributes to client data  privacy , security , and confidentiality, but this is  
beyond the scope of these  guideline s. The authors developed Figure 2 as a visual model  of the guidelines’ 
content . Privacy

What does the growth of mobile technology mean for health services?  
Mobile phone penetration worldwide is on the rise. As of 2016, low- and middle -income countries had 
94 cellular subscriptions per every 100 inhabitants ( International Telecommunications Union , 2016). In 
addition, active mobile broadba nd subscriptions are increasing at a rapid rate, growing nearly fivefold  
over the past five years (8.3  per 100  inhabitants in 2011 to 40.9 per 100 inhabitants in 2016) ( International 
Telecommunications Union , 2016). Figures  3 and 4 illustrate  the rapid growth of mobile cellular 
subscriptions and mobile broadband subscriptions.

The use of mobile devices in healthcare can make it easier to access care, improve care delivery, empower 
patients through targeted messaging, and collect real -time data to optimize resources and decision making 
(World Bank, 2016).  Over the past decade, public health practitioners have been taking advantage of the 
growing mobile penetration rate , by incorporating mobile technology in health programs.  Practitioners 
use mobile health, or mHealth, to increase access to health services an d information in some of the 
hardest -to-reach places on earth, and mobile interventions span the entire health system (Labrique, et al., 
2013).  
As a result, health programs are exploring ways to harness mobile technology to increase health coverage, 
improve the quality of care , and reduce healthcare costs. Labrique and colleagues identified 12 common 126.7

need to be credible and consistent, and they should be collecte d and stored securely in a trusted electronic 
health record with managed access for patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals (Kumar & 
Wambugu, 2015).  As data collected by mobile devices contain protected health information or personally 
identifia ble information, there are considerable concerns around data confidentiality  (Sacks, J., et al. 
2015). Personal  and sensitive health information store d on mobile devices and servers can affect  the 
landscape of data security policies and procedures.  
These guidelines are  a practical tool for policymakers  and program implementers , to ensure that mHealth 
programs protect  sensitive health information . There are several layers of security that an mHealth 
program should  focus on to improve data security. Because  the security of mHealth data relies on the 
security of each layer , these guideline s cover the layers of mobile device  security : that is,  the application, 
the operating software, the device, the network, and the servers (TrustLa w Connect, et al., 2013). These 
guidelines  go beyond the technology and address  security issues related to user behavior and national 
policies . 
How do the Principles for Digital Development apply to data security, privacy , 
and confidentiality ? 
These guidelines were developed in line with the Principles for Digital Development (Principles for 
Digital Development, 2017) , which outline best practices for digital health programming. The Principles 
for Digital Development  are written by and for international development professionals  and are freely 
available for use.  Broadly, these guidelines operationalize three of  the eight  Principles for Digital 
Development that ensure responsible data practices through out the data life cycle , from  collection to 
disposal. These Principles are : 
• Design with the user: Engage users during the design process to build systems that protect 
sensitive information, keeping in mind user priorities, needs and contexts. See the Designing for 
and with the User  section of these guidelines for more information.6      mHealth Data Security, Privacy, and Confidentiality Guidelines  • Understand the existing ecosystem : To ensure protection of sensitive information, implemente rs should 
make sure that their mHealth programs abide by national and organizational policies related to data 
security, privacy , and confidentiality. One way to do this is by engaging with t echnical working groups and 
national eHealth committees. See the  National and Organizational -Level  Leadership and Governance  
section of these guidelines for more information.  
• Ensure  data privacy and security : Data privacy, security , and confidentiality considerations should be 
incorporated in all aspects of your mHealth program. See Table 5, Recommendations to ensure data 
security throughout the project life cycle,  for more information.  
How were these guidelines developed?  
These guidelines were developed as a follow -up to one of the recommendations of the most recent report in 
MEASURE  Evaluation ’s mHealth data security series, mHealth for Health Information Systems in Low - and Middle -Income 
Countries: Challenges and Opportunities in Data Quality, Privacy , and Security  (Wambugu & Villella , 2016) . One of the main 
recommendations in this report was  the need for a follow -up guideline for policymakers , decision makers, and 
mHealth program implementers to strengthen the  security, privacy, and confidentiality of mHealth program s. This 
report and its  recommendation s resulted from  information gleaned both from key informant interviews in Kenya 
and Tanzania  and from a literature  review  of data security and privacy practices and risks in using mHealth in HIS 
strengthening in LMICs. In Kenya and Tanzania , informants working with mHealth programs identified varying 
levels of capacity and preparedness to protect data collected via mHealth programs. The literature review revealed  
the unique data security and priv acy risks that come with using mobile devices to collect, transmit, and store 
sensitive data . The report identified a lack of guidelines or best practices for protecting mHealth data in 
strengthening HIS. More information about the results of the report, t he report can be found at this link: 
https://www.measureevaluation.org/resources/publications/tr -16-140. 
Although  more stakeholders in the development sector have identified  the need to have responsible data practices 
and have created subsequent resources  to guide implementation of these practices , such as  Oxfam’s Responsible Data 
Training Pack  (Hastie & Bolton , 2017) and the Responsible  Data F orum ’s The Hand -Book of the Mode rn Development 
Specialist: Being a Complete Illustrated Guide to Responsible Data Usage, Manners & General Deportment (2016) , we found that 
some resources were more focused on a project lifecycle and not on routine HIS. We also did not find resources 
speci fic to the unique challenges in protecting data that is collected using mobile devices. This gap in practical 
guidance and interest from countries for more information on this topic led to the development of these guidelines.  
Additionally, t his work builds on MEASURE Evaluation’s previous work on  digital health ’s privacy and security. 
See Appendix A  for a list of related MEASURE Evaluation resources.  
The development of the mHealth Data Security, Privacy and Conf identiality Guidelines followed these steps : 
 
• Meetings with digital health stakeholders to assess interest and need in guidelines related to mHealth data 
security, privacy , and confidentiality  
• Literature review  
• Two half -day workshops with 50 Kenyan and Ghanaian digital health stakeholders to provide feedback on 
the draft guidelines  
• Draft guidelines review by a panel of technical experts in digital health, HIS, and mHealth data security, 
privacy, and confidentiali ty 
Additional information regarding the development of the guidelines is available in Appendix C .

These guidelines are organized in three broad sections , which are outlined as follows :  
• National and Organizational -Level Leadership and Governance:  How leadership, policy 
and governance at the national and organizational levels can strengthen protections around 
sensitive inf ormation  
• Technology:  How to safeguard sensitive data from vulnerabilities intrinsic to mobile systems 
throughout the data lifespan, including the mHealth application, the operating system, the device, 
the mobile network , and data storage services  
• User  Beha vior: What users of mHealth applications and tools need to know to ensure the 
security, privacy , and confidentiality of sensitive data stored on mHealth devices  
Each section provides an overview of best practices and considerations for protecting sensitive  data in the 
mHealth context . 
    mHealth Data Security, Privacy, and Co nfidentiality Guidelines       9 NATIONAL  AND  ORGANIZATIONAL -LEVEL  LEADERSHIP AND 
GOVERNANCE  
Although  technology has a variety of tools that 
can be applied to  safeguard sensitive data, 
strong leadership  and organizational and 
national governance  are necessary to ensure the 
protection of sensitive data that are collected, 
stored, and transmitted through  mobile devices 
in mHealth programs. This section describes 
key components of national - and 
organizational -level governance  that, if 
implemented, c ould strengthen mHealth data 
security, privacy , and confidentiality.  
 
 
National -Level  Leadership and Governance  of mHealth Programs  
The integration of mobile technologies in national and local health systems has security and privacy 
implications at the policy level. This section outlines common components of national e Health strategies, 
as well as core elements of privacy laws to consider while developing policies to oversee mHealth 
programs.  
Questions Answered in This Section  
• What components are usuall y included in a national eHealth strategy?  
• What core elements of health data privacy laws do mHealth project managers need to know?  
To oversee and coordinate the influx of digital technology in their HIS, many ministries of health are 
developing their own e Health strategies , which outline their visions, strategic objectives, and 
implementation and oversight plans for incorporating digital technologies in their health systems. 
mHealth is recognized by the Global Observatory of eHealth as a key component of eHealth to support 
universal health coverage (World Health Organization, 2015). In its National eHealth Strategy Toolkit, 
the World Health Organization  and the International Telecommunication Union identify mHealth as an 
example of eHealth that would be  addressed in an eHealth strategy  (2012) . Therefore, an eHealth strategy 
in a country can have important governance implications for mHealth programs in the country.  Countries 
have different priorities, but there are similarities across the ir eHealth strategies. We reviewed eHealth 
strategies from Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia , and outlined the common 
components of their eHealth strategies  (see Table 2). Countries can use this as a tool to include or 
improve data security sections of their eHealth strategies. Some countries  choose also to develop an 
mHealth strategy, outlining their plans for the use of mHealth in the health sector , as a defined subset of 
eHealth activities in the country . For example, South Africa’s mHealth Strategy f or 2015 –2019 was 
embedded in its eHealth Strategy and linked to the eHealth Strategy objectives (National Department of 
Health, Republic of South Africa, 2015).

Privacy a nd Data Protection Principles  
United Nations Global Pulse outlined key principles  of data privacy and protection t hat organizations 
and decision makers can use as a guide for creating their own principles.   
A key component of many  eHealth strateg ies is the development of an eHealth  and mHealth  governance 
committee, tasked with developing  policies and overseeing the ir implementation. Having strong leadership 
is crucial for ensuring that mHealth programs abide by data security, privacy, and confidentiality 
guidelines.  eHealth strategies should  also articulate issues such as who is accountable for breaches  of 
privacy and under what circumstances; whether technology companies take responsibilities for weak 
hardware, software , and communication technologies;  whether national and subnational health au thorities 
in a country are responsible for not putting in place failsafe mechanisms on information systems when 
data security is breached ; and the recourse for health system clients when their privacy is breached.  
In addition, h ealth data p rivacy regulati on is critical in providing  a legal framework on which eHealth 
operates.  According to  the mHealth Alliance  and TrustLaw Connect ’s report  addressing privacy law in 
mHealth, national policies on data security, privacy, and confidentiality should include the components 
described in Table 4. Key

Organizational -Level  Leadership and Governance  of mHealth Programs  
Governments are responsible for creating  national -level policies to oversee the growing mHealth sector, 
and implementing organizations have an obligation to follow national policies  and best practices to 
protect sensitive health information that are collected and managed  within an mHealth system. This 
section outlines key activities and recommendations that can enhance the security of mHealth programs  
through leadership and governance within implementing organizations . 
Questions Answered in This Section  
• What should my organization do before, during, and after implementing an mHealth project to 
make sure that we protect sensitive data?  
• What resources will help my organization prepare for data security needs of an mHealth project?  
• How do organizational poli cies align with national data protection laws and policies?  
Organizations implementing mHealth programs should consider  the recommendations listed in Table 5 
to ensure data security, privacy , and confidentiality.  12      mHealth Data Security, Privacy, and Confidentiality Guidelines  Table 5. Recommendations to ensure data security throughout the project life cycle  
Project stage  Recommendation  
Conceptual stage  Form a technical working group or engage with an existing e Health and 
mHealth  governance committee and other local stakeholders. This group 
would have the authority to oversee, review , and advise on data 
security. Data breaches would be reported to this group.  
Check national and local policies, guidelines , and laws related to 
management of sensitive information.  For data that passed through 
Internet service providers, u nderstand the data that they retain, how 
long they keep them, and how they are used . 
Conduct a feasibility study to understand the mHealth  security 
landscape, requirements , and strengths and weaknesses of your mHealth 
program.  For example, use the mHealth Assessment and Planning for 
Scale  Toolkit  and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s  
Checklist for Assessment of Data Security and Confidentiality Protections 
to guide your feasibility study ( see Table 6 ).  
Consider hiring or contracting the services of trained security 
professionals.  
Write  or adapt  a standard operating procedure outlining how data 
would be recovered if lost , how devices with data will be disposed of , 
how organizations will respond to theft or loss of device  or data , how 
organizations will respond to data breaches , how organizations will 
respond to protocol violations , and what security provisions  to use . 
During the design phase of your mHealth program, incorporate elements 
of “security by design” to ensure that security features reflect user needs 
and context. See the User Behavior  section  for more information.  
Develop memorandums of understanding between collaborating  
partners, outlining their roles and responsibilities.  
Set up a rigorous monitoring and evaluation system to monitor data 
breaches and ensure quick response.  
Implementation 
Stage  Implement a m echanism for m onitoring and evaluation  for continuous 
improvements . 
Establish o ngoing collaboration with the technical working group, the 
eHealth governance committee, local stakeholders , and other 
partnering organizations . 
Monitor, d ocument , and respond to data breaches or privacy  
challenges . 
Provide ongoing trainings and refresher trainings for users. For more 
information, see the  Training and Technology Literacy  section.  
Provide feedback to the overseeing body or committee . 
Post-
Implementation 
Stage  Conduct an evaluation  with a focus on responsible data practices , 
including data security and privacy measures for the project.  
Share lessons learned with all involved parties . 
Dispose of data and devices according to the country’s established 
standard operating procedures .   mHealth Data Security, Privacy, and Co nfidentiality Guidelines       13 Table 6. Resources for conducting a feasibility assessment  
mHealth Assessment and Planning f or Scale Toolkit  
The World Health Organization, the UN Foundation, and Johns Hopkins Global mHealth Initiative 
developed the mHealth Assessment and Planning for Scale  Toolkit  to help mHealth programs track 
key components they need to scale (WHO, UN Foundation,JHU GmI, 2015) . Several domains include 
indicators that can be used to implement and monitor protocols that protect mHealth data security, 
privacy, and confidentiality.  
Checklist f or Assess ment of Data Security a nd Confidentiality Protections  
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed guidelines and an accompanying 
checklist  to assess the data security and confidentiality protections for programs related to HIV, viral 
hepatitis, sexually transmitted diseases, and tuberculosis (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
2011). The checklist provides programs with guidelines on how to:  
• Identify key individuals and designate a leadership team.  
• Review current policies and gather resources.  
• Identify weaknesses and barriers.  
• Assess physical security and define the secure area.  
• Assess electronic security, protections, and methods of data transfer and storage.  
• Assess training needs  
 
  14      mHealth Data Security, Privacy, and Confidentiality Guidelines  TECHNOLOGY  
 
 
Having a detailed security protocol that addresses 
the most common reasons for data loss will 
prevent most  data security, privacy, and 
confidentiality breaches (Arora, Yttri, & Nilson, 
2014). This section contains  suggestions for 
increasing the security of mHealth data, but 
implementers and policymakers  should find a 
balance between the level of security and the 
functionality of the mHealth program (Arora, 
Yttri, & Nilson, 2014).  
Mobile technology  operates within a mobile 
ecosystem,  so mHealth implementers and 
policymakers  should consider the many layers of 
security configurations available within an 
mHealth ecosystem. This section outline s the levels of a mobile ecosystem that affect mHealth data 
security and measures that program implementers can take to ensure the security of personal health 
information stored in this system.

  mHealth Data Security, Privacy, and Co nfidentiality Guidelines       15 Figure 5 illustrates  the interaction between the components of an mHealth ecosystem. The mobile device  
transmits data to remote data storage through the mobile network. This interaction may take mere 
seconds or minutes  (or longer, depending on the strength of the network) , but it can leave sensitive data 
vulnerable to data breaches.  Decisions  made by  mHealth managers  regardi ng which device, operating 
system, app, mobile network , and storage system to use in their programming  could have implications for 
data security, privacy , and confidentiality. This section will explore these decision  points  and potential 
vulnerabilities . 
Figure 5. Mobile technology ecosystem  
 
Each component in the ecosystem  is interconnected, and the security of the overall mHealth system relies 
on the security of each individual part.  
mHealth  Application and Data  
A mobile software application, or app, is  a program designed to perform a specific function or set of 
tasks or activities on a mobile device. For the purposes of these guidelines, the term “application” is 
platform agnostic; the authors use the term “application” to describe any mHealth tool, whe ther it is a 
smartphone app, interactive voice response,  or Short Message Service ( SMS). Having said that, the 
authors recognize that not all recommendations apply to SMS or interactive voice response -based 
programs.  The sensitivity of health data requires  that the developers of mobile apps for health should 
build systems that have a secure back -end database; keep minimal or no PHI data on the device ; and 
ensure that the hardware, software , and communication channels between the device and other systems 
are secure.  
Many  mHealth apps record , transmit , and store PHI, and thus the design and configuration of mHealth 
apps play a significant  role in determining the overall security of the data. This section outline s methods 
of securing data throughout the life  cycle of data in relation to the mHealth app.  
Questions Answered in This Section  
• What steps can I take throughout the data management life cycle to increase the security, 
privacy, and confidentiality of data stored within my mHealth application?  
• When are sensitive health data most vulnerable?   
A mobile app store is a repository of mobile applications. Examples include Google Play and Apple’s 
App Store. This repository provides a selection of approved applications that can be downloaded and 
installed on th e device, because m ost app stores offer safeguards to protect users from installing  apps that 
could steal sensitiv e information (Clark, 2009 ; Perakovic, Husnjak, & Remenar, 2012). From the 
developer perspective, data security can be strengthened within an app, particularly related to how 
16      mHealth Data Security, Privacy, and Confidentiality Guidelines  sensitive data are stored, accessed , and transferred (Majchrzycka & Poniszewska -Maranda, 2016 ; Arora, 
Yttri, & Nilson, 2014).  
Developers can take steps  to mitigate certain vulnerabilities at each stag e in the data life  cycle, although it 
is important to note that increased security usually correlates with increased cost. It is up to the program 
staff to determine the appropriate balance of data security and cost for their respective mHealth projects. 
Table 7 outlines steps to mitigate security risks . 
Table  7. Steps to mitigate security risks throughout the data life  cycle  
Data management stage  Best practice  
Data capture and storage  Limit the amount of data that are  collected and  stored on 
the device, including the internal memory or removable 
storage such as SD card  and SIM card (Arora, Yttri, & Nilson, 
2014).  
Encrypt sensitive data using Advanced Encryption Standard 
algorithm (Majchrzycka & Poniszewska -Maranda, 2016 ; Arora, 
Yttri, & Nilson, 2014).  
Back  up or archive data to prevent data loss.  
Be aware of the data management policies of each platform 
you use (i.e. , telecom provider, mobile application ). 
Access to data  Decide which users should have access to which data. 
Restrict access to sensitive data using passwords or two -factor 
authentication (Arora, Yttri, & Nilson, 2014).  
Use geolocation to track the location of the device when it 
requests access to sensitive information to flag potential 
misuse of sensitive data. Google Maps API is one way to 
implement this (Majchrzycka & Poniszewska -Maranda, 2016) . 
Use an application device identifier, which should be a 
randomly  generated 32 -bit string, to identify requests for 
sensitive information (Majchrzycka & Poniszewska -Maranda, 
2016).  
Train user s to log out after every session, or program the 
session to time out after a certain length of time (Majchrzycka 
& Poniszewska -Maranda, 2016).  
Ensure that mHealth apps do not request permissions that 
they  do not require, such as access to SMS, camera, 
contacts, etc.  
Data transfer  Use end -to-end data encryption when transferring sensitive 
data to hide the content of the message (Arora, Yttri, & 
Nilson, 2014 ; Majchrzycka & Poniszewska -Maranda, 2016).  
Use a digital signature to ensure that the message received is 
the same as the message that was sent (Majchrzycka & 
Poniszewska -Maranda, 2016).  
Ensure that security  keys contain at least 128 -bits to offer 
sufficient security (Arora, Yttri, & Nilson, 2014 ; Majchrzycka & 
Poniszewska -Maranda, 2016).  
If your mHealth program uses a web application, consider 
using secure transfers such as HTTPS . 
Data disposal  Outline how to dispose of sensitive data in a standard 
operating procedure  to ensure that there is no risk of 
exposure . 
Best practices for disposal of digital data include  “clearing 
(using software or hardware products to overwrite media with 
non-sensitive data), purging (degaussing or exposing media 
to a strong magnetic field in order to disrupt the recorded   mHealth Data Security, Privacy, and Co nfidentiality Guidelines       17 Data management stage  Best practice  
magnetic domains), or destroying the media (disintegration, 
pulveri zation, melting, incinerating or shredding)” (Office for 
Civil Rights, 2015) . 
Operating System  
A mobile operating system  (OS) is specifically designed to run on mobile devices , such as mobile phones, 
smartphones,  personal digital assistants , tablet computers and other handheld devices. Some mobile 
device OS are Apple iOS, Google Android, Research in Motion ’s BlackBerry OS, Nokia ’s Symbian , and 
Microsoft ’s Windows Phone OS. Some, such as Microsoft ’s Windows 8, function as both a traditional 
desktop OS and a mobile OS.  
Given the context of each project, the authors recognize that mHealth practitioners might not have the 
luxury to choose an operating system , because most  users may already have a cert ain type of phone . If 
they can choose, however, this section should be used to help mHealth practitioners choose an operating 
system  that is best suited for their program.   
Questions Answered in this Section  
• What security considerations should I be aware of when choosing a mobile operating system?  
• How do I balance functionality and security of different operating systems?  
Whichever operating system program managers choose,  they should make sure that users keep their 
device’s operating system  updated for t he best protection. Hackers search for vulnerabilities in systems, 
so keeping current with computer updates is important , because  these generally patch known 
vulnerabilities.  
Choosing an operating system for your mHealth program is a balance between funct ionality and security. 
Both Android and iOS are relatively secure. Although  Android provides more functionality for mHealth 
programs than iOS, it also gives more autonomy to the user, which can create vulnerabilities if the user is 
not properly trained. Table 8 outlines questions to consider when choosing operating systems.  
Table  8. Considerations related to the s ecurity of operating systems  
Security questions to consider when choosing  
an operating system  Rationale  
Is the OS open source, or is it a closed 
environment?  Open source allows for more contributions 
from the developer community, but it can 
leave some vulnerabilities , making it prone 
to security threats.  
Are there existing policies that protect users 
from downloading apps prone to 
insecurity?  Some OS and OS app stores protect users 
from down loading insecure apps , such as  
iOS and Android . 
Does the OS require user permission to 
install and update apps?  Asking for user permission is an additional 
layer of protection . 
Does the OS support restricted profiles?  Preventing users from accessing non -work -
related websites and apps can limit data 
breaches . 
Device  
Security  and privacy of data begin  with the mobile device. Many mHealth managers need to decide 
whether users will operate the mHealth application on their personal device or whether  the project will 18      mHealth Data Security, Privacy, and Confidentiality Guidelines  procure devices for the users. Each decision has  pros and cons . One factor to consider is that using a 
personal device can increase the vulnerability of  sensitive data, such as by getting viruses, leaving the 
phone around for others to find, or getting hacked.  Users  will also use their devices for personal reasons, 
and the project will not have control over how devices are used. A recent report, Mobile Technology in 
Support of Frontline Health Workers , outlined several pros and cons after surveying 70 mHealth experts 
(Agarwal, et al., 2016) .  
Whether health w orkers use their own device for  health service provision or data management  activities , 
or are provided with a device by the mHealth program, proper training can prevent many common data 
breaches. This section outlines common security risk s for mobile devices and possible solutions to 
counter those risks.  
Questions Answered in This Section  
• What are common security risks to mobile devices?  
• How do I care for my device so that it will serve the program longer?  
Common breaches occur when mobile devices are lost o r left unsecured, when password  rules are not 
enforced , and when mHealth users transfer or acces s sensitive information over an unsecured public 
network (Arora, Yttri, & Nilson, 2014). People who are responsible for mHealth devices  should also be 
trained to resist phishing attempts, where people inadvertently give away sensitive information to hackers 
(Perakovic, Hu snjak, & Remenar, 2012). Table 9 outlines common security risks and their corresponding 
solutions.  
Table 9. Common secu rity risks for mobile devices and possible solutions  
Risk Best practice  
Unauthorized users gain access  Lock device in a secure location when not in use . 
Enable remote wiping of data or device -locking protocols, 
also called geofencing.  
Hacked passwords  Use as many types of characters as possible (uppercase, 
lowercase, punctuation, etc.) If the device has provision for 
biometric security such as fingerprints, explore the feasibility 
of its use.  
Use at least 8 –12 characters  for a password.  
Change passwords regularly . 
Use a password management program; do not write the 
password down . 
Avoid easy -to-guess passwords, like “password,” “123456,” 
or a user’s  name . 
Phishing attempts  Train users to recognize and report phishing attempts . 
Viruses  Avoid adding removable storage to mHealth devices . 
Train users to recognize possible sources of viruses . 
Keep the application and operating system up to date . 
Ensure that devices undergo regular maintenance .  
Physical security  Whenever possible, use a case to protect the mobile 
device from damage, moisture, dust , and dirt . 
Keep mobile devices within optimal temperature range, 
according to the manufacturer . 
Make sure that the mobile phone has access to a charging 
station. If this is  not possible, users should continuously save 
data so that they are not lost if the power runs out.    mHealth Data Security, Privacy, and Co nfidentiality Guidelines       19 Network  
A network is a connection of mobile devices, servers , and computers  through communication media . A 
network is used to transmit information from one device to another. Networks  can be accessed  in many 
ways, each with its own level of security. This section outline s the risks and benefits of transmitting 
sensitive health information through each type of network, including public and private wireless

• What loopholes do hackers exploit to compromise data?  
• Which networks are the most secure for  transmitting sensitive data?  
• What can you do to keep your device safe in a network?  
Implementers of mHealth programs need to provide a secure network for data transfer as well as train 
users to recognize vulnerable  networks to ensure the security, privacy, and confidentiality of sensitive 
data. As Arora and colleagues observe, because wireless connections are “more susceptible to monitoring 
and interception than broadband (internet) networks…security protocols [are] the only barriers protecting 
data against a breach” (Arora, Yttri, & Nilson, 2014). Thus providing a secure connection, using 
encryption, training users in data security, and following a security protocol will help prevent data 
breaches.  In addition, it is critically important to put in p lace an intrusion detection system , that is, a 
network appliance that uses a set of heuristics to match known attack signatures against incoming 
network traffic and raises alerts when suspicious traffic is seen.  
When planning your mHealth program, you have  options —each with its own risks and benefits —for 
providing a secure net work for data transfer.  Table 10 outlines how to make the different types of 
wireless networks more secure for your mHealth program.  
Table 10. Networks and mHealth data security  
Network  Considerations  
Public wireless Internet  Sensitive data should never  be transferred over public 
wireless Internet  because data will be vulnerable to 
hacking by unauthorized users.  
All users of mHealth  programs must be trained on how to 
recognize vulnerable networks. These include slightly 
misspelled Wi -Fi network names or suspicious network 
names such as  Free PUBLIC WI -FI. Be especially careful not  
to connect to personal hotspots or to ad  hoc networks that 
you do not  know and trust.  
Programs should install and update firewall software 
regularly on their mobile devices to further safeguard data.  
Virtual Private Network (VPN)  If you must use public Wi-Fi, VPNs are the most secure 
option , because they use authentication and encryption to 
provide “’virtual private’ tunnels for your data through the 
public internet” (Goldsborough, 2013). A disadvantage of 
VPNs is that data transfer may be slow , which might burden 
users, and VPNs are comparat ively expensive (Arora, Yttri, & 
Nilson, 2014).  
Private wireless Internet  Private wireless networks are relatively secure but must be 
secured with a password (Goldsborough, 2013).  
Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 networks are the most secure, but 
they must be enabled on the device (Goldsborough, 2013 ; 
Arora, Yttri, & Nilson, 2014).  20      mHealth Data Security, Privacy, and Confidentiality Guidelines  Network  Considerations  
Mobile broadband network 
(3G/4G /LTE) 3G, 4G, and higher  networks are generally secure, using  
encryption and authentication . 
The network is not  always reliable , and transmission can be 
slow. 
Bluetooth  Organizations should change default settings of Bluetooth 
devices to reflect security policies (Padgette, et al., 2017).  
Bluetooth security features include authentication, 
confidentiality (preventing eavesdropping), and 
authorization (Padgette, et al., 2017).  
Bluetooth BR/EDR/HS mode 1 is not secure; mode 4 is the 
most secure (Padgette, et al., 2017).  
Bluetooth LE uses Advanced Encryption Standard -Counter. 
Bluetooth LE Security Mode 1 Level 3 is the most secure 
option (Padgette, et al., 2017).  
Bluetooth is susceptible to “denial of service attacks, 
eavesdropping, MITM attacks, message modification, and 
resource misappropriation” (Padgette, et al., 2017).  
Data Storage  
Once data are collected, mHealth programs need to decide where data should be stored. Different 
programs will have different storage needs, and some might choose to have either on -device or server 
backups to avoid data loss. mHealth programs often store sensitive health informatio n, so this section can 
be used to outline security risks and benefits of data storage options, including on -device storage, 
dedicated local s evers , and cloud -based servers.   
Questions Answered in This Section  
• What are our options for storing mHealth data?  
• What are the risks and benefits of storing data on the device?  
• What are the risks and benefits of storing data on a cloud or dedicated server?  
Storing sensitive data on a server, rather than on a device, can increase the security of the data, because  it 
minimizes the risk of human error ( e.g., accidentally deleting data, compromising data through personal 
Internet  usage) (Majchrzycka & Poniszewska -Maranda, 2016) . In resource -strained environments where 
security is a concern, t he emphasis should be on cloud -based services served through HTML5 apps  (Celi, 
et al., 2017), and  Table 11 outlines the risks and benefits of storing data on the device, local dedicated 
servers , and cloud -based servers.  The case study on pages 23 –24 outlin es how one mHealth program has 
taken steps to protect patient data in several of the components of the mobile technology ecosystem.    mHealth Data Security, Privacy, and Co nfidentiality Guidelines       21 Table 11. Risks and benefits of storage on devices, local dedicated servers , and cloud -based

   mHealth Data Security, Privacy, and Co nfidentiality Guidelines       23 This case study examines how the Community -based Hypertension Improvement Project  handled some 
of the security considerations in the development of its mHealth application to help protect patient 
data confidentiality and privacy.  
Application Layer  
Because the health workers use the information on the device for ongoing diagnostics and treatment, 
a copy of patient information is stored on the device and another copy is transmitted to a cloud server. 
The application is protected by a unique username a nd password. The system generates a password 
for each authorized user that allows users to access the application during their work. This mechanism is 
useful because if a user is unable to log into the app, the system administrator can help the user access  
the app because he or she can trace the password from a log.  
Data Access within the A pplication  
The program is organized in groups , so that providers who are in close geographic proximity  work in the 
same group. To further protect  patient information in t he application, access is restricted to those in the 
group of providers with whom the cardiovascular nurse works.  
Device  
The project has a routine maintenance plan for the devices. The devices are inspected monthly to 
ensure that they function as they sho uld. Any unauthorized apps are removed , and damaged devices 
are either repaired or replaced as soon as possible. One lesson the project learned about managing 
the devices is to set policies about which applications could be installed on the device , because  the 
system administrator spends time during the monthly inspections deleting third -party applications.  
Data Storage  
The patient information is transmitted from the device to a cloud server , using GSM mobile services. 
Access to data on the server is restri cted to people cleared to access them.  As an added security 
feature, the server automatically records all transactions that occur in the database. The database 
administrator monitors this log to see whether an unauthorized person accesses the data. B y reviewing 
this log, the a dministrator can identify any unauthorized access or attempted access.

  24      mHealth Data Security, Privacy, and Confidentiality Guidelines  USER BEHAVIOR  
 
User behavior is inextricably linked to the 
security, privacy , and confidentiality  of an 
mHealth program. Although  the technology 
provides certain levels of security, people who 
operate and control the mobile devices are the 
first line of defense against breaches of security, 
privacy, and confidentiality. The Principles for 
Digital Development encourage implementers to  
train data users to minimize security risks 
(Principles for Digital Development, 2017) . This 
section explores user-behavior aspects of data 
security and where they overlap with privacy and 
confidentiality.

  mHealth Data Security, Privacy, and Co nfidentiality Guidelines       25 Training and Technology Literacy  
Health workers often maintain the mobile devices, input and transmit health data, and sometimes use the 
mobile device for personal Internet  activities . Therefore they  must be trained to improve their  technolog y 
literacy and to minimize privacy and security risks (Arora, Yttri, & Nilson, 2014) . This section outlines the 
components of effective trainings to increase technology  literacy regarding  security.  
Questions Answered in This Section  
• What content should a training cover?  
• What is the optimal length of a training for an mHealth program?   
According to a recent systematic review of the literature, training health workers to use mobile phones 
can be an effective way to increase data quality (Agarwal, et al.,  2015). A training of trainers model could 
be a useful training model for scaling up an mHealth program (Agarwal, et al., 2015). Table 12 describes 
key components of an effective training aimed at increasing  the technology  literacy of users of mHealth 
programs.

Designing for , and with  the specific user s of your mHealth  program will help ensure that  the app is easy 
to use, which will minimize human errors. User -centered design puts the perspective of the end user at 
the center of the design process. This section outlines questions that should be answered during the 
design process to maximize the security of data from an mHealth program.  
Questions Answered in This  Section  
• What questions should we ask the developers during the design stage?  
• How can we incorporate “privacy by design” in the mHealth application?  
• Where can we learn more about human -centered design?  
Making sure that users are engaged throughout the design process is the best way to “make the user 
interface intuitive and easy to understand” (Agarwal, et al., 2015). The “privacy by design” approach is the 
idea that measures to protect the security, privacy , and confiden tiality of sensitive data can and should be 
incorporated in the design of the app (Information Commissioner's Office, 2017) . The Principles for 
Digit al Development  lists “design with the user” as the first principle, and the website provides a number 
of useful resources for implementers (Principles for Digital Development, 2017).  Table 13  lists resources 
for user-centered design.  
Table 13. User-centered design resources  
Field Guide f or Human -Centered Design  
IDEO’s Field Guide for Human Centered Design  explains the desig n process and provides examples 
of participatory activities that can be used to understand the user’s perspective.  
Principles f or Digital Development  
The Principles for Digital Development website also provides a list of toolkits  to help implementers 
design with the user.   
Putting the user at the center of the design process makes the app easier to use, and increasing health 
worker s’ underst anding of the app can also improve data security, privacy, and confidentiality (Agarwal, et 
al., 2015). Table 14 outlines questions that are related to data security, privacy , and confidentiality  that 
should be addressed during the design process.  The case  study on pages 29–30 outlines how one mHealth 
program addressed planning for security in its design and implementation and user training.

Fast Facts  
Who  mHealth Kenya, in partnership with the Kenya Ministry of Health  
What  Mobile laboratory (mLab), which transmits laboratory results through a mobile 
application from laboratories to health facilities  
Where   Kenya, in more than 300 health facilities (in more than 20 counties)  
Primary users  Caregiver (clinician) at the Comprehensive Care Clinic and lab technician at the lab   
Device  Cell phone and tablet (Android -supported phone or tablet (version 5.0 and above)  
Platform  SMS-based Android app and web -based app  
Mobile laboratory (mLab), a CDC -funded project implemented by mHealth Kenya , in partnership with 
the Kenya Ministry of Health, aims to reduce the time taken from the dispatch of results from 
laboratories to the receipt of those results at the health facilities. The project is being implemented in 
more than 300 health facilities. T he goal of the program is to link people living with HIV to care in a 
reasonable time, thus contributing to the third 90 of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS 
09-90-90 targets.  
The mLab application has a web and an SMS -based mobile application.  Data from Early Infant 
Diagnosis and Viral Load lab results are sent from the lab through a web platform to the mobile app in 
the form of a n SMS. This SMS is sent to a facility -owned phone , where providers can check the results. 
Providers can also opt to receive messages in their own devices when the results are ready, but the 
results themselves are sent only to the facility -owned phone. mHealth Kenya took security, privacy, and 
confidentiality of lab results into account during both the planning and imple mentation stages in the 
following ways.  
Planning for Security  
During the design phase, mHealth Kenya was engaged in several mapping activities to identify risks 
and vulnerabilities in the system. They mapped all the potential system users and their use cas es. They 
then matched the different users with their roles and identified their access levels (see below). They also 
mapped all the access points to the system (e.g., APIs  and forms) and ensured that they were 
protected against unauthorized access by third -party applications. This mapping included a system 
analysis and a risk assessment of the existing systems and asked questions such as:  
• Does the facility have a secure place to  put the device?  
• What is the sensitivity of the data?  
• What is the bandwidth availability?  
Implementation  
Application Security  
As mentioned earlier, only the one facility -owned phone receives the SMS with the lab results. This SMS is 
encrypted and cannot  even be read until it is ingested in the application. Providers must use a login 
and password to access the application and view the test results. SMS are sent to other users’ phones , 
letting them know that results are ready to be viewed. But to view the results , they must go to the 
facility -owned phone and log  in to the application.    mHealth Data Security, Privacy, and Co nfidentiality Guidelines       29 Data Access Levels  
The mLab program has set up levels of users, and each level has the ability to see only certain 
information. The levels are as follows:  
• Health facilities:   
o Able to see individual patient data and test results  
• Service delivery partners:   
o Not able to see lab results  
o Able to add facilities, remove users, and view dashboards of results that have been 
sent to facilities  
• National level:  
o Able to view dashboards wit h high -level information such as how many facilities are 
receiving results  
Data Transmission  
Sensitive data sent using the mLab web application from the client to the server and vice versa are 
shielded , to avoid privacy leaks using Secure Sockets Layer. Th e SMS messages containing the test 
results that are sent to the facility tablet or phone are also encrypted , and can be read only when they 
are ingested in the mLab mobile application.  
User Training  
mHealth Kenya trains service delivery partners implementi ng mLab in the health facilities , so that the 
partners can then train their facility staff. This is a day -long training, as is the training for facility users. The 
training is done through a practical demonstration of the use of the platform. The program u ses random 
supportive supervision at the facilities to ensure that users are comfortable with the application. The 
program also sends notifications to users about emerging security trends , as they arise.   
Training topics are the following:  
• How to add facilities and counties  
• How to add facility administrators and notifiable persons for the facilities  
• How to use training tools  
• Password management  
• Emerging security trends

  38      mHealth Data Security, Privacy, and Confidentiality Guidelines  APPENDIX  C. HOW THE GUIDELINES W ERE DEVELOPED  
In developing  these guidelines , the authors reviewed the findings and recommendations from the mHealth 
for Health Information Systems in Low - and Middle -Income Countries: Challenges and Opportunities in Data Quality, 
Privacy and Security  report , and searched for additional literature t o update the information in that report.  
Guided by  the results from this literature review , MEASURE Evaluation developed an interview guide, 
which was used to  obtain feedback and insights from a total of 40 mHealth stakeholders in Kenya and 
Ghana during tw o half -day workshops.  
Kenya and Ghana  were selected for several reasons. First, b oth countries were in the process of enacting 
legal frameworks for data protection: the Data Protection Act , in Kenya , and the Personal Data 
Protection  Act, in Ghana. Both countries have a good mix of paper and electronic data management 
systems with associated guiding documents, including policies and frameworks. Both countries have 
recently launched their five -year strategic frameworks for eHealth  and digital health . MEASU RE 
Evaluation also h ad other related ongoing work in these countries, which made it easier to leverage  the 
resources needed . 
In Kenya, MEASURE Evaluation hosted a half -day workshop with a technically -diverse group of 
21 participants representing mHealth im plementers from the private sector, nongovernmental 
organizations , government , and donor organizations. Participants were divided in groups to review each 
section of these guidelines to provide feedback on what should be added, removed , or changed in each 
section. Follow -up conversations were conducted with some workshop participants to better understand 
their feedback.  
This process was repeated in Ghana two weeks later, where 19 stakeholders, representing the 
government, nongovernmental organizations , academia , and the private sector participated in the 
workshop. Changes were made to the document based on suggestions that came from workshop 
participants. See Appendix B  for country contributions.  
Finally, the document was sent to six digital health experts involved with MEASURE Evaluation, who 
were asked to review the guidelines and provide feedback. Five of the six reviewers accepted. They 
provided their reviews on the content, structure of the do cument , and applicability to low- and middle -
income countries.  The authors  discussed and incorporated the feedback in these guidelines as 
appropriate.
