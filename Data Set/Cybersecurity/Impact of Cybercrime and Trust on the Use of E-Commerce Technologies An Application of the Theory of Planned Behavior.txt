Abstract 
Cybercrime issues across many economies are increasing at a faster rate. The rapid 
diffusion and penetration of the internet, as well as the processes of digitization of 
economic activities, have been the major catalysts. These cybercrime activities continue to 
pose a serious threat to e-commerce technologies and influence consumers' intention to 
conduct transactions using such a medium. Considering the upsurge of cyber-crime 
activities and the paucity of research in this domain, particularly in developing countries, 
this paper investigated how cyber-crime and trust affect users' intention to conduct 
business via e-commerce technologies. Using a survey approach, an online questionnaire 
was distributed and data from 476 participants was rigorously analyzed using Partial Least 
Square Structural Equation Modelling. The results indicate that trust in internet media, 
attitude towards behavior, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control and cyber-crime 
perceptions are significant predictors of intention to purchase using e-commerce 
technologies. The findings elucidate businesses and stakeholders on the impacts of trust 
and cybercrime perceptions on users' purchase intentions. It further brings to the fore the 
need to incorporate security features that reduce the vulnerability of e-commerce 
platforms.

 229Introduction 
E-Commerce also referred to as Electronic Commerce is the use of information 
technology, including the Internet, computer, and other electronic devices, for buying, 
selling, transferring, and exchanging products, services, or information ( Rezk, Barakat, & 
Saleh, 2017 ). E-commerce offers a lot of opportunities to businesses from small and 
medium scale enterprises (SMEs) to large scale industries (Leena, 2011). Businesses believe 
that the use of e-commerce offers numerous opportunities and advantages to their 
operations (Wirtz et al., 2010, Fang et al., 2014). The merits associated with the use of e-
commerce include access to global and international marketplace, reduction in cost of 
operation, mass customization, high rate of competitive advantage and trading 24 hours in 
e-commerce (Kartiwi, 2006). E-commerce offers opportunities for firms to save time and 
also become cost-effective. As a result, e-commerce has positive effects on businesses as it 
increases the effectiveness of business operations and enhances financial performance of 
firms. 
Globally, e-commerce transactions are faster and have become the preferred means of 
transacting business internationally as compared to traditional or physical business (Fang et 
al., 2014). Rapid Internet usage and powerful handheld devices, as well as tremendous 
advancement of technology, remain the major factors contributing to the evolution of e-
commerce technologies (Gantayat & Giri, 2016). The web and the Internet provide an 
essential medium for facilitating e-commerce transactions and technologies.  Over the 
years, the Internet has facilitated the growth in the use of e-commerce thereby allowing 
many firms to adopt various e-commerce models (Gibbs & Kraemer, 2004). Since there 
are differences in the nature of market operations as well as resource strengths, the 
adoption and integration paths of e-commerce technologies by firms in their business 
operation also differs (Boateng, Molla, Heeks, & Hinson, 2011).  
E-commerce technology adoption is increasing, and this has opened avenues for 
cybercrime activities (Johnson, 2016; Gantayat & Giri, 2016). Cybercrime issues across 
many economies are increasing at a faster rate ( Gamreklidze, 2014 ). The rapid diffusion 
and penetration of the internet, as well as the processes of digitization of economic 
activities, have been the major catalysts. As a result, cybercrime issues in Africa seem to be 
the worst. Amidst the staggering activities such as human trafficking, financing of terrorism 
and money laundering, incidents such as credit card fraud, SIM-box fraud, cyber 
terrorism, Email spoofing, phishing, and false identification have surged considerably 
(Rezk et al., 2017). In 2018, the Bank of Ghana banking cyber fraud report revealed that 
cyber fraudsters steal or attempted to steal 325.9 million Ghana Cedis (61.5 million US 
Dollars) from financial institutions operating in the county (Bank of Ghana, 2019). 
Cybercrime, therefore, hinders the smooth development of the country’s economy 
(Baylon & Antwi-Boasiako, 2016). 
Ghana has consistently recorded growth in its economy over the past few years. In 
2019, the International Monetary Fund predicted the Ghanaian economy to be the fastest-
growing economy in the world, with a growth rate of 8.8 percent (Naidoo & Wallace, 
2019). The country’s economic growth has in part been attributed to the processes of 
digitalisation with most services being offered through online and automated services. The 
banking and financial industries have been at the centre of the digitisation of the Ghanaian 
economy. Due to the digitisation, internet penetration has become central to the country’s 
economic development (Baylon & Antwi-Boasiako, 2016). However, the tremendous 
Internet penetration has brought a steady increase in cybercrime activities (Warner, 2011). Apau & Koranteng – Impact of Cybercrime and Trust on the Use of E-Commerce Technologies: An Application of

 230The reliability of the internet connection is further anticipated to provide opportunities for 
cybercriminals to engage in illicit activities online, thereby increasing the number of 
people who are likely to fall, victim.  
Although e-commerce has increased during the last years around the world, many 
users, especially in developing countries, do not trust e-commerce to complete their 
purchase. It is therefore imperative to empirically examine the factors that account for 
users’ distrust in e-commerce technologies so as to override any obstacle that may derail e-
commerce technology adoption and its usage. Currently, research that discusses country-
specific cybercrime perception and its influences on e-commerce purchase intention are 
scarce (Boateng et al., 2011). This paper adopts the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) 
(Ajzen, 1991) as the theoretical lens to explore the study constructs. Cybercrime 
Perception, Trust of Sellers and Trust of Internet Medium are integrated with the relevant 
constructs of TPB. The question this paper seeks to address is how cybercrime perceptions 
and the various dimensions of trust affect users’ intention to use e-commerce technologies. 
In doing so, we attempt to answer the calls for investigations into country-specific 
cybercrime and e-commerce activities. Our findings will enlighten stakeholders on the 
extent to which the proposed relationships affect users’ purchase intention.   
 
Literature Review / Related Works 
Cybercrime is the threat caused by irresponsible actions of computer and internet users 
who take advantage of the vulnerabilities associated with the computer networks and the 
internet medium to perpetrate crime ( Bendle, 2019 ). Cyber-crime is often perpetrated by 
organized groups (Levi, 2008), with the potential of causing large magnitude of losses. 
According to Hawkins, Yen, & Chou (2000), the openness of the Internet medium  allows 
everyone access, creating an open medium for cybercrime activities. Furthermore, 
anonymity on the Internet hides the intentions of cyber-criminals (Laudon & Traver, 
2016), thus making it more challenging to address cyber-crime activities. In essence, 
business transactions involving the use of the Internet poses significant threats or risks to 
both customers and vendors alike if the necessary security measures are not put in place. 
(Patel, Patel, Patel, & Pathrabe, 2017). Losing money through Internet purchases due to 
cybercrime affects both businesses and customers. Indeed Boateng et. al., (2011) suggest 
that cybercrime activities have the potential to stall development in less advanced 
countries. 
Crimes mostly associated with the use of the Internet include fraudulent sales online, 
electronic fund transfer, identity theft/crimes, advance fee schemes and fraudulent 
investment (Clough, 2010). The risk associated with e-commerce business transactions is a 
source of worry for many due to the activities of cyber-criminals. Therefore, for successful 
business transactions using the Internet, measures must be put in place to safeguard the 
security of both customers and businesses (Apau, Koranteg, & Adu, 2019). Many less 
developed countries have made significant strive towards the adoption of e-commerce 
technologies. However, notorious computer users continue to take advantage of the 
vulnerabilities associated with the Internet medium and computer networks to perpetrate 
crimes against users (Warner, 2011). Perpetrators of cyber-crime identify weaknesses and 
vulnerabilities in e-commerce technologies, exploit the weaknesses and take advantage of 
victims using various means (Patel et al, 2017).  International Journal of Cyber Criminology

 231Internationally, cybercrime and other criminal activities on the internet are on the rise. 
Warner (2011) attributes the increasing cybercrime activities to the inability of security 
agencies to have the necessary legal framework to deal with perpetrators. The diverse 
views on the prosecution of cybercriminals have also contributed to the non-standardized 
and lack of common legal framework for cybercrime prosecution (Brenner & Koops, 
2004). The major challenge has been the application of the law of jurisdiction (Brenner, 
2007). Currently, opinion on how cybercrime perpetrators should be punished is divided.  
Whereas some school of thought believes it should be the country where the internet 
service provider is located, others think it should be according to the laws of the country 
where the website is located. Many others also advocate for the person to be punished 
according to the laws of the country where the crime was committed (Brenner, 2007).  
All these challenges have contributed to consumer fear with regards to the safety of their 
online transactions, thereby making them distrustful of e-commerce technologies and 
associated platforms.  
Many researchers have studied the effect of cybercrime on e-commerce transactions 
from different perspectives. Henson (2011) examined the extent to which the fear of 
cybercrime victimization and perceived risk affect customers’ intention to purchase using 
e-commerce platforms. Using data collected from undergraduate university students of 
Cincinnati, the study found that, a larger proportion of the study respondents are worried 
about the fear of becoming victims of cybercrime.  This fear, however, influences people's 
online behavior towards e-commerce transitions. Rofiq (2012), similarly conducted an 
empirical investigation into the effect of cyber fraud and trust with the online purchase 
intention of Indonesian consumers. Using the theory of Planned Behavior, the study 
results show that perceptions of cyber fraud have a negative effect on e-commerce 
transactions. Studies have further shown that the perception of cybercrime is not only 
prevalent in developing countries. A study conducted by Bohme and Moore (2012) found 
that cybercrime perceptions affect European citizens' intention to engage in online 
shopping, online banking, and other electronic transaction platforms. On the contrary, 
persons that have not heard anything about cybercrime are more willing to use online and 
electronic technologies for transactions.  
E-commerce transactions must be safe for both sellers and buyers. In using the internet 
for any business transaction, trust is considered an important and significant indicator. 
(Rofiq & Mula, 2010). Thus, all antecedents of trust including institutional trust (trust of 
e-commerce sellers), technological trust (trust of internet medium) and service trust (trust 
in e-commerce) have a significant influence on consumers’ purchase intention (Salel, 
Resk, & Barakat, 2017). Gefen, Benbasat, and Pavlou (2008) have highlighted the need to 
investigate the effects of trust on e-commerce activities, particularly within a social 
context. An empirical study conducted by Mukherjee & Nath (2007) examined 
consumers’ intention to purchase through e-commerce. Mukherjee & Nath (2007)’s study 
re-examined commitment trust theory and found that trust and commitment positively 
affect consumers’ purchase intention. Kim, Yim, Sugumaran, and Rao (2016), also 
examined consumers’ purchase intention and e-commerce technologies and found that 
trust and benefits positively affect consumers’ purchase intention, risk negatively affects 
purchase intention and trust negatively influence risk. Dai and Palvia (2009) conducted a 
cross country study in China and USA to examine customers’ intention to use mobile 
commerce. The study found that consumers’ intention to purchase using mobile 
commerce in China is influenced by subjective norm, perceived ease of use, and perceived Apau & Koranteng – Impact of Cybercrime and Trust on the Use of E-Commerce Technologies: An Application of

 232usefulness, whereas perceived innovativeness, compatibility, ease of use and perceived 
usefulness are the determinants of the use of mobile commerce in the USA. Consumers’ 
intention to re-purchase through e-commerce technologies were examined by Zhang et 
al. (2011). The study revealed that quality online relationships and perceived usability of 
the website are predictive indicators of consumers’ re-purchase intention. Salel et. al., 
(2019), found that cybercrime perception, trust of internet medium and the trust of sellers 
have an effect on Egyptian intention to purchase using e-commerce.  In assessing the 
effect of consumer product evaluation and trust on repurchase intention, Sullivan and Kim 
(2018), found that perceived value and trust are the major determinants of consumer 
repurchase intention using e-commerce. Similarly, perceived risk perceived privacy and 
trust were found to the main predictors of user adoption of e-commerce in Sri Lanka 
(Aboobucker, 2019). Many more other studies have evaluated the dimension of trust on 
consumers’ intention to purchase using e-commerce platforms (Abyad, 2017; Hallikainen, 
Laukkanen, 2018; Oliveira, Alhinho, Rita, & Dhillon, 2017; Ribadu & Rahman, 2019; 
Wen, Du, Ren, & Pan, 2019). 
The review has shown that studies examining consumers' purchase intentions through 
the use of e-commerce and their cybercrime perceptions are limited. Perceived risk and 
trust remain the most used constructs that examine the purchase intention of e-commerce 
consumers. This paper employs cybercrime perceptions and trust as predictors of e-
commerce purchase intention. The cybercrime perception is derived from perceived risk 
(Im, Kim & Han, 2008), and fear of crime (Warr, 2000). A lot of the studies conducted on 
consumer purchase intention using e-commerce were predominantly done across Europe 
and the United States. Therefore, it is important to test if concepts validated in these 
countries are applicable to countries where e-commerce is gradually emerging. Therefore, 
studying these concepts in Ghana, West Africa, which is currently undergoing the 
processes of digitization adds to the body of knowledge and empirical literature on the 
phenomena.  
 
Theoretical Framework 
 
1. Theory of Planned Behavior 
This study adopted the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as the theoretical 
foundation underpinning the research. TBP is considered as one of the most classic 
theories of persuasion, acceptance, and use of technology. The theory emerged as an 
extension of the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) (Fishbein & Ajzen (1975).  The 
theory is used to explain the relationship between attitude and behavior in humans and is 
also used to predict how individuals behave based on their pre-existing attitudes and 
behavioural intentions. Ajzen (1991) believed that attitude towards behavior, perceived 
behavioral control and subjective norm are the three basic determinants of intent. 
Behavioral intention is the likelihood and willingness to perform certain behaviour (Zhang 
et al,.2011). According to Cohen, Ding, Lesage and Stolowy (2008) attitude is measured 
by people’s belief that behaviour leads to some outcome that can be favorable or 
unfavorable. Subjective norms, however, is the degree to which a person thinks that the 
importance of other people influences their behavior (Chen & Lu, 2011). Perceived 
behavioral control is considered an important aspect for consumers given the attitude 
towards certain behavior and the reference group of others within the society ( Sun, Law, International Journal of Cyber Criminology 
Vol 13 Issue 2 July – December 2019

 233& Schuckert, 2019 ). Perceived behavioral control refers to the potential constraints of 
intended actions, such as available resources and opportunities. Thus, perceived behavioral 
control refers to the ability of individuals to control a given behavior (Hsu and Huang, 
2012). TPB has been employed in many studies that examine decision-making processes, 
including online shopping intention (Chuchinprakarn, 2005; Fortes & Rita, 2016; Pappas, 
2016; Lim et al., 2016; Van der Heijden, Verhagen & Creemers, 2003), M-commerce 
adoption ( Gangwal & Bansa, 2016;  Mansyur, Hariadi, & Andayani, 2018 ) and Mobile and 
internet banking intention ( Khasawneh & Irshaidat; 2017; Shankar & Kumari, 2016 ). This 
paper adopts TPB because it is one of the most used theories in the field of e-commerce 
that has successfully been used to explain and predict users’ behavior. Figure 1 shows the 
constructs of the original TPB.

2. Conceptual Model  
The conceptual model proposed in this study integrates cybercrime perceptions, trust of 
Internet medium and trust of sellers with the Theory of Planned Behavior (Fishbein & 
Ajzen, 1975). Trust of sellers comprises three dimensions including ability, benevolence, 
and integrity (Mayer, Davis & Schoorman, 1995), whereas trust of the internet medium 
consists of an understanding of the medium, reliability and technical competence (Lee & 
Turban (2001). The proposed model postulates that cybercrime perceptions, trust of sellers 
and trust of internet medium directly affect attitude towards behavior and e-commerce 
purchase intention. The assumption made in this paper is that, the perception of users on 
the existence of cybercrime is not only attitudinal but also intentional. This could be as a 
result of users' online experiences or opinions of people they know. Therefore, users 
develop an attitude towards cybercrime and become conscious of falling victims to such 
criminal activities online. By so doing, users become intentional in their choices and 
transactions online. This, therefore, means that their trust in e-commerce technologies

 234become attitudinal and intentional. Furthermore, it is suggested that subjective norm and 
attitude towards behavior influence e-commerce purchase intention. Hypotheses are 
therefore postulated based on this conceptual model, to test the relationships between the 
constructs. Figure 2 illustrates the conceptual model for the study.

3. Hypothesis Formulation  
Trust remains a critical antecedent that influences many businesses. Trust demonstrates 
the partners’ commitment to trust business contracts. (Lee et al., 2011), Koranteng, Wiafe, 
and Kuada (2019)  argue that the fear of being exploited by others is eliminated when trust 
exists between individuals. Thus, confidence in business relationships is increased by trust 
and plays a significant role in the quality and nature of business transactions that often exist 
between sellers and buyers (Lee, 2009). Tung et al. (2008), El Said and Galal-Edeen International Journal of Cyber Criminology 
Vol 13 Issue 2 July – December 2019 
 
© 2019 International Journal of Cyber Criminology (Diamond Open Access Journal). Under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) License 
 
 235(2009) and Kim et al. (2008) have all demonstrated that trust of sellers positively influences 
e-commerce purchase intention. Therefore, hypothesis one is formulated as follows: 
 
Hypothesis 1: Trust of e-commerce sellers positively affects e-commerce consumers’ 
purchase 
  
The trust of the seller in e-commerce transactions is an important factor influencing 
individuals’ attitudes to purchase using online services. In China and the USA, evidence 
by previous studies suggests the effect of trust of sellers on the desire of consumers to 
purchase or transact business using electronic business services (Pavlou & Chai, 2002). 
This, therefore, means that, as consumers trust in online sellers’ increases, their attitudes 
towards behaviour of online purchases also increase. In an empirical study of consumers’ 
e-commerce purchase intention which conducted by El Said and Galal-Edeen (2009), the 
study results showed that the trust of e-commerce sellers have a positive impact on the 
behavioral attitude intention to purchase through online means. Hypothesis two, 
therefore, is stated as follows: 
 
Hypothesis 2:  Trust of e-commerce sellers positively impacts consumers’ attitude towards 
behavior 
 
Confidence in technology and its features are imperative in influencing users’ 
perceptions and attitudes. Naturally, people are reluctant to adopt technologies if they 
have concerns. Kaplan & Nieschwietz (2003) empirically prove that customers are hesitant 
to perform transactions on e-commerce platforms because of the lack of trust in the 
Internet medium. Several studies have demonstrated the positive effects of consumers’ 
trust in technology and its influence on attitude towards e-commerce technologies 
(Grazioli & Jarvenpaa, 2000; Wu & Chen 2005; Dinevet et.al., 2008). The online 
behavior of consumers, their desire to engage in business activities or commerce using 
online technologies will be based on the trust and confidence the consumer has for the 
medium in which the transaction is taking place. Consumers are aware of the 
vulnerabilities associated with internet technologies, as such e-commerce consumers will 
prefer to transact business with vendors that have the necessary infrastructure to protect 
their interest whiles they are online. As consumers’ Internet medium trust increases, their 
attitude towards the use of e-commerce to transact business will be positively increased. In 
accordance with these empirical studies, hypothesis three postulates that: 
 
Hypothesis 3:  Trust of the internet medium positively influence e-commerce consumers’ 
attitude towards behavior 
 
Customers’ desire to use e-commerce technologies for business transactions is 
significantly influenced by the role of technology. Technology remains an important 
precursor in encouraging and facilitating customers’ business transactions through the use 
of e-commerce technologies. However, there is hesitation on the part of many people to 
transact business using e-commerce technologies due to lack of trust with the Internet 
medium (Kaplan & Nieschwietz 2003). Tung, Chang & Chou (2008) have also pointed 
out that trust of a system positively influences the decision to use electronic logistics 
information systems. This, therefore, means that if trust is achieved or maintained, Apau & Koranteng – Impact of Cybercrime and Trust on the Use of E-Commerce Technologies: An Application of 
the Theory of Planned Behavior

 236customers will be comfortable in transacting business using online or e-commerce. 
Therefore, fourth hypothesis is stated as follows: 
 
Hypothesis 4:  Trust of the Internet medium positively impacts consumers e-commerce 
purchase intention   
 
The perceived risk serves as barriers to the success of e-commerce transactions and 
technologies. Negative perceptions reduce individuals’ commitment and willingness to 
transact business using online services (Rofiq et al, 2011). Studies have further 
demonstrated that perceived risk negatively affects customers’ attitudes towards online 
purchases (Lee, 2009; Dinev et al. 2008-9). Due to the continuous activities of online 
fraudsters and cyber fraud activities such as credit card fraud, phishing, man in the middle 
attacks, auction fraud, identity theft, and many other online related crimes, many 
consumers have a negative attitude towards online transactions for fear that, they will be 
victims of crimes on the Internet. According to Lee (2009), the negative perception of 
people towards online business transaction consequently has effects on the attitude to 
conduct business using online technologies. This, therefore, means that cybercrime 
perceptions of e-commerce consumers negatively affect their attitude towards behavior of 
e-commerce technologies. This study postulates hypothesis five as follows: 
 
Hypothesis 5:  Cyber-crime perceptions negatively impacts attitude towards behavior 
 
As already mentioned, perceived risk poses great obstacles to the successful execution of 
e-commerce transactions. Due to risk, customers are not willing to conduct business or 
purchase items on the Internet using e-commerce technologies. Kim et al. (2008) opined 
that perceived risks negatively impact consumers’ intention to purchase using online 
technologies. Fear of crime in online environment also contributes negatively to e-
commerce transactions (Dinev, Hu & Yayla (2008). The perception of people that crime 
will be committed against them through their online purchases will prevent them from 
engaging in online transactions. Hypothesis six is therefore postulated as follows: 
 
Hypothesis 6:  Cyber-crime perceptions negatively impacts consumers’ intention to 
purchase through e-commerce. 
 
According to Cohen, Ding, Lesage and Stolowy (2008) attitude is measured by people’s 
belief that a behaviour leads to some outcome that can be favorable or unfavorable. 
Attitude toward behaviour is explained in the e-commerce adoption as the evaluation of a 
person’s desire to transact business through the use of e-commerce technology. Several 
studies previously conducted have revealed that ‘attitude towards behavior’ positively 
impact online purchase intentions. Chen & Li (2010) found that ‘attitude towards 
behavior’ has a positive influence on the intention to use e-services. Other studies that 
have shown positive relationship between attitude and purchase intention include Kim et 
al (2008), El Said and Galal-Edeen (2009), Crespo and Bosque (2008) and Yu and Wu 
(2007). This study, therefore, formulates hypothesis seven as follows:

 237Hypothesis 7:   ‘Attitude towards behavior’ positively influences consumers’ e-commerce 
purchase intention. 
 
Subjective norms, however, is the degree to which a person thinks that the importance 
of other people influences their behavior (Chen and Lu, 2011). The applicability of 
subjective norms in e-commerce stem from the perceived social pressure pertaining to 
conducting business using e-commerce (Rofiq et al, 2011). In e-commerce technologies, 
numerous studies have demonstrated that subjective norms positively influence the 
intention to transact business through the use of e-commerce technologies. Several studies 
conducted in the past have shown a positive association between subjective norm and the 
consumer’s e-commerce technologies purchase intention (Crespo & Bosque, 2008; Lim & 
Dubinsky, 2005). In addition, Yu and Wu (2007) in their study empirically demonstrated 
that a positive relationship exists between subjective norm and purchase intentions. 
Hypothesis eight is there formulated as follows: 
 
Hypothesis 8:  Customers’ subjective norm positively impacts consumers’ e-commerce 
purchase intentions. 
 
Perceived behavioral control is considered an important aspect for consumers given the 
attitude towards certain behavior and the reference group of others within the society 
(Sun, Law, & Schuckert, 2019 ). Perceived behavioral control refers to the potential 
constraints of intended actions, such as available resources and opportunities. Thus, 
perceived behavioral control refers to the ability of individuals to control a given behavior 
(Hsu and Huang, 2012). Related to intention to commit to transactions using e-
commerce, George (2004) demonstrates that perceived behavioural control affects 
intentions to purchase through the Internet. Chen and Li (2010) also present that 
perceived behavioural control has a direct influence on continuous e-service usage 
intentions. This finding is similar to a report of Lim and Dubinsky (2005) that perceived 
behavioural control affects purchase intentions on the Internet. Perceived behavioural 
control is a perception of ease or difficulty that controls performing a transaction using e-
commerce. In this regard, hypothesis nine is postulated as follows:  
  
Hypothesis 9:  Customers’ perceived behavioral control positively impacts consumers’ e-
commerce purchase intentions 
 
Based on the stated hypothesis, a model was therefore postulated to show the relationships 
between the various hypotheses that have been formulated. Figure 3 demonstrates the 
hypothesized model for the study.

Methodology 
 
a. Data Collection 
This research seeks to deductively predict users’ intention to purchase using e-
commerce technologies. To be able to draw a generalized conclusion based on the 
population sample, a survey research approach was adopted to prove or otherwise the 
validity of the hypotheses developed (Saunders et al., 2009). An online questionnaire was 
adopted as the primary instrument for collecting data for this paper. Links to the online 
questionnaire was disseminated through social media platforms in Ghana. Additionally, a 
self-administrated questionnaire was distributed. This method has gained popularity in International Journal of Cyber Criminology

 239recent times and has been widely used. Previous studies conducted by Hansen et al (2004), 
Jensen et al. (2005), Liao et al. (2007), Murphy and Blessinger (2003) and Rofiq and Mula 
(2010) which examined similar subject in different jurisdiction all made use of online 
questionnaires. More recently, Merhi, Hone, and Tarhini  (2019) adopted the same 
procedure to collect data which was used to examine Lebanese and British consumers’ 
intention to use mobile banking services. While this approach was to ensure the 
questionnaire was widely distributed, responses were only limited to Ghanaians.  
The questionnaire consisted of two parts. The first part comprised six closed-ended 
questions determining the demographic characteristics of the study respondents through 
the use of nominal scale.  The demographic variables included age, gender, education, 
occupation, use of e-commerce and cybercrime experience. The second part included the 
TPB model items which were adopted from previous studies. The TPB constructs 
included: (i) Customer Subjective Norm (CSN) (ii) Attitude Towards Behavior (ATB) 
(iii) Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC) and (iv) Consumer’s E-commerce Purchase 
Intention (IPE). These constructs were measured using three items each. In addition, three 
items were also adopted to measure the integrated constructs, thus; (v) Trust of the 
Internet Medium (TIM) (vi) Trust of E-commerce Seller (TES) (vii) Cyber Crime 
perception (CCP). Most of the question items were adopted from prior studies (appendix 
one). 
This study adopted non-probabilistic, convenience sampling technique specifically for 
the data collection. This method was employed, as it enables the researcher to collect data 
from potential participants of the study based on their availability. The period of the data 
collection was between June and August 2018. Respondents who were willing to 
participate in the study were asked to report their opinions on a set of five-point Likert 
scale questions related to the factors that influence their e-commerce purchase intentions. 
Nonetheless, all the questions were pretested with 20 initial participants to validate their 
reliability with all Cronbach’s alpha values greater than 0.7. Following the pre-testing of 
the questionnaire, four questions were subsequently modified. Participation in this study 
was entirely voluntary and no financial reward was offered to the study participants.   
 
b. Data Analysis 
Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was used in the 
evaluation of the hypothesized model. PLS-SEM is a statistical technique that allows 
researchers to simultaneously test and estimate a hypothesized relationship in a given 
conceptual model in order to establish the possible correlation between dependent and 
independent variables (Sarstedt, Ringle, & Smith, 2014). PLS-SEM is based on the 
iterative approach that maximizes the explained variables of endogenous constructs (Hair, 
Sarstedt, Hopkins, & Kuppelweiser, 2014). Contrary to the Covariance-Based (CB) SEM 
which aims to confirm theories y determining how well a model can estimate a covariance 
matrix for the sample data, PLS-SEM operates very much like multiple regression analysis 
(Hair, Ringle, & Sarstedt, 2011). The PLS-SEM approach provides potent techniques for 
validating the measurement model and also for the estimation of the structural model. 
Thus, PLS is effective for observing the relationship between latent variables (Hoyle, 
1995). According to Hair, Hult, Ringle, and Sarstedt (2016), PLS is appropriate for 
research that extends existing theory and in situations where the research goal is to predict 
the effects of target constructs. Moreover, unlike other covariance-based techniques, PLS 
is robust to errors from a multivariate distribution (Gefen, Rigdon, & Straub, 2011). PLS-Apau & Koranteng – Impact of Cybercrime and Trust on the Use of E-Commerce Technologies: An Application of

 240SEM has received considerable attention in recent times across many disciplines including 
marketing (Hair, Ringle, Sarstedt, & Mena, 2012), management information system 
(Ringle, Sarstedt, & Straub, 2012) and operations management (Peng & Lai, 2012). PLS 
requires that the sample size should be ten times larger than the number of structural paths 
directed at a target construct in a structural model hence, suitable for this study. Also, PLS-
SEM was considered appropriate for this study due to its applicability in a situation where 
a transition between dependent (exogenous) and independent (endogenous) variables 
occurs as in the case of behavioral intention (IPE).  
 
Results  
 
1. Descriptive Analysis 
The data were screened for missing data and duplicate responses. The results as shown 
in table 1 indicate that the missing value for all 21 indicators is zero, as such the 476 
responses were used for the final data analysis. This means that all 476 respondents who 
participated in the survey completed the questions perfectly. Missing data does not exist 
and as such further treatment for missing data is not required. The initial model consisted 
of seven constructs and 21 indicators. These are TIM, TES, ATB, CCP, CSN, PBC and 
IPE.  Each of them consisted of three items each. The mean for all items was above 3. 
The mean for all the items ranged between 3.025 and 4.789. This implies that majority of 
the respondents indicated generally positive responses to the factors under consideration. 
In order to ensure the accuracy of the data for further analysis, the test of normality was 
conducted. The Partial Least Square (PLS) analysis of the data shows absolute kurtosis 
values range from 0.061 (CSN1) to 1.22 (CCP3) and the absolute skewness values also 
range from 0.165 (ATB2) to 1.098 (CCP1) (Table 1). The maximum kurtosis value 
achieved from the test was 1.22 while the test achieved a maximum skewness value of 
1.098. The normal range of kurtosis and skewness is ±2.58 as indicated by Tabachnick and 
Fidell (2007). This presupposes that all the items were found to be normally distributed 
since their kurtosis and skewness were found to be less than ±2.58 . Based on the kurtosis 
value and skewness value obtained in this study, the assumption of normally distributed 
data is achieved; hence PLS-SEM analysis of measurement model and structural models 
were estimated. Table 1 shows a detailed analysis of normality. 
All respondents indicated that they had used e-commerce before as shown in Table 2. 
An analysis of the respondents’ demographics indicates a male majority of 82.4% whereas 
female representation was only 17.6%. Also, respondents below 30 years were recorded as 
majority (75.6%), 22.7% were between 30 and 50 years whilst 1.7 were above 50 years. 
Majority (74%) of the respondents were having undergraduate degree with the remaining 
(26%) having postgraduate degrees. Moreover, 42.9% representing majority of the 
respondents were students, 25.2% were professional workers, and 16.8% were self-
employed with 15.1% being academics. In terms of the cybercrime experience of 
respondents, majority (63%) indicated that they have fallen victim to spam. Also, 40% have 
experienced investment fraud whereas 17% have encountered phishing mail. The rest are 
identity theft, credit card fraud, auction fraud, parcel courier email scheme representing 
14%, 12%, 10%, and 5% respectively. Other types of cybercrime accounted for 4%.  The 
summary of respondents’ demographics is shown in table 2.

2. Measurement of Constructs 
The study considered Coltman, Devinney, Midgley, and Venaik (2008)’s 
recommendation for analysis of measurement model. The item reliability, internal 
consistency, convergent and discriminant validity were studied. All constructs were 
modeled as reflective and item loadings were above the 0.7 threshold (Barclay, Higgins, & 
Thompson, 1995) (see table 2). Internal consistency was analyzed using Cronbach’s Alpha. 
As other researchers prefer, composite reliability was also assessed (table 3).

Convergent validity was measured using Average Variance Extracted (AVE). As 
required by Wixom and Watson (2001) all AVE values were above 0.5. Discriminant 
validity was measured by comparing the square root of AVE of a latent variable against 
correlations with other latent variables (Fornell & Lacker, 1981). The diagonal values in 
table 4 show that all correlation values were greater than the AVEs of constructs as 
preferred by Fornell and Lacker (1981).

The possibility of multicollinearity was also evaluated using Variance Inflation Factor 
(VIF). According to (Hair et al., 2016), VIF less than 3 is required. Table 5 shows the

with TIM, TES and CCP accounted for 58.2% of the variance of IPE.

Again, most of the proposed relationships were supported. Specifically, CCP ( β = -
0.385, p < 0.001) and TIM ( β = 0.781, p < 0.001) significantly affected ATB. In addition, 
CCP (β = -0.436, p < 0.005), TIM ( β = 0.501, p < 0.001), CSN ( β = 0.655, p < 0.005), 
and PBC ( β = 0.991, p < 0.001) had significant impacts on IPE. Meanwhile, TES failed 
to affect ATB ( β = 0.095, p < 0.005) and IPE ( β = 0.050, p > 0.005) respectively. In 
table 6, a summary of all the proposed relationships, their path coefficients, p-values ad 
whether they were supported or not are indicated.

As some researchers prefer, Stone-Geisser (Q2) was also analyzed to complement the R2 
values. The results indicate all Q2 values were greater than 0.2 thus proving the validity of 
the model (see table 7). Further analysis was performed to evaluate the total effects and 
effects sizes of the proposed relationships (Cohen’s f 2). Effect sizes can be small irrelevant 
(<0.02); small (0.02); medium (0.15) or large (0.35).

Discussion  
In this study, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) was adopted as a theoretical lens 
to examine consumers’ intention to make purchases using e-commerce. The theory was 
extended with relevant constructs (Trust of E-Commerce Seller, Trust of Internet 
Medium, Cyber Crime Perception) to improve the potency of the model. The research 
model was evaluated using Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling. The 
independent constructs explained 55.2% and 58.2% of the variances in Attitude Towards 
Behavior and Consumers’ Purchase Intention respectively. Specifically, the model 
proposed that Trust of E-Commerce Sellers affects both Attitude Towards Behavior and 
Consumers Intention to Purchase. Although previous studies (Kim et al. 2008; El Said & 
Galal-Edeen 2009); Liu et al. 2005); Tung et al. 2008) have found positive associations 
between these constructs, the results were contradictory in this study’s context. This is not 
surprising given that e-commerce is still an emerging concept in developing countries. 
Thus, unlike developed countries where consumers' purchase intentions may be informed 
by sellers’ online rating or reputation, this might not be the case in developing countries 
given the limited knowledge about the innovation. In addition, Trust of Internet Medium 
and Cyber Crime Perceptions influenced Attitude Towards Behavior and Consumer 
Intention to Purchase using E-Commerce. This finding is supported by Kim et al. (2008) 
and Yang et al. (2012). In essence, knowledge about perceived risks and threats on the 
internet is not limited to developed countries. As such, negative cyber-crime perceptions 
negatively affect consumers’ attitude and purchase intentions. Moreover, Subjective Norm 
and Perceived Behavioral Control impacted Consumers Intention to Purchase Using E-
Commerce. In other words, the expectations of relevant others influenced consumers to 
use e-commerce for their purchase. Although findings from relevant studies (Yu & Wu 
2007; Lim & Dubinsky, 2005; Hansen et al., 2004) support this result, it is reasonable. 
This is because people living in developing countries have great respect for elders in the 
society. Therefore, consumers will most likely adopt the opinions of respected people in 
society to use e-commerce for their purchases.         
 
Conclusion and Recommendations  
 
a. Conclusion 
The merits associated with e-commerce technologies is undoubted. Relevant research 
has shown that e-commerce enables cost reduction, mass customization and high rate of 
competitive advantage. However, the recent rise of cyber-crime incidents threatens the 
use of e-commerce technologies for transactional operations. Amidst these, there is a 
paucity of research with regards to the factors that influence e-commerce use for 
transactions, particularly in developing countries. To bridge this gap, this paper adopted 
the Theory of Planned Behavior as a theoretical lens to examine which factors influence 
Consumers Intention to Purchase using E-Commerce. The theory was extended with International Journal of Cyber Criminology

 247Cyber Crime Perceptions, Trust of E-Commerce Sellers and Trust in Internet Medium. 
Responses from 467 participants gathered using Google Forms were analyzed with Partial 
Least Square Structural Equation Modelling. The results indicated that Cyber Crime 
Perception, Trust in Internet Medium, Subjective Norm and Perceived Behavioral 
Control all impact Attitude Towards Behavior and Consumers’ Intention to Purchase 
Using E-Commerce. There was also a positive association between Attitude Towards 
Behavior and Consumers’ Intention to Purchase Using E-Commerce. Meanwhile, Trust 
of E-Commerce Sellers failed to impact either Attitude Towards Behavior and 
Consumers’ Intention to Purchase Using E-Commerce. Some of the findings contradict 
existing findings. This confirms that technology behavior differs across societies. 
Furthermore, it unveils the importance of trust and cyber-crime perceptions of e-
commerce usage. As such, stakeholders are encouraged to improve the security and 
privacy features of e-commerce technologies. In addition, the development of appropriate 
e-commerce frameworks is needed to identify and punish offenders. This will reduce the 
negative perceptions associated with e-commerce.        
 
b. Main Contribution and Advancement of Research 
The present study addressed a noteworthy gap in extant e-commerce adoption 
literature through the extension of Theory of Planned Behavior with Cyber Crime 
Perceptions and trust. Trust remains a critical variable in e-commerce transactions and 
their addition improved the TPB significantly achieving good model fit. Whiles e-
commerce adoption and research have gained notable recognition and well-grounded in 
developed countries, there is the paucity of research in developing countries where e-
commerce is emerging. This present study is, therefore, fundamental to the continuous 
development and improvement of e-commerce technologies in Ghana and other countries 
with similar cultural settings.  This study, therefore, contributes to validating constructs 
that have been tested in developed countries on e-commerce adoption in developing 
countries. The importance of accounting for countries with different economic, cultural, 
social and psychological factors when examining e-commerce adoption thus emerges as 
integral to the advancement of technology adoption studies. 
 
c. Managerial and Practical Implications 
E-Commerce contributes significantly to the advancement of businesses in developing 
countries. This assertion is driven by the perceived potential of the internet in reducing 
transaction and operational costs and facilitating global supply chains. The results presented 
in this study provide relevant implications for both e-commerce stakeholders and 
businesses in developing countries especially Ghana and countries of similar cultural 
settings on the factors that affect intentions to purchase using e-commerce. Specifically, it 
informs developers of e-commerce technologies of the importance of trust and how it 
affects users’ adoption behavior. The guarantee of security, privacy, and trust should be of 
paramount importance in future strategies targeting e-commerce technology adoption, in 
addition to a continuous promotion of use of technology. We recommend that developers 
and designers should integrate major security features in future e-commerce technologies 
to curtail breaches and vulnerabilities. This will boost users’ confidence and trust in the 
system. By these findings, governments, policymakers, and stakeholders are also 
enlightened on the effects of cyber-crime perceptions on users’ purchase intention. As 
indicated, the lack of strong legal frameworks for e-commerce activities is a major cause of Apau & Koranteng – Impact of Cybercrime and Trust on the Use of E-Commerce Technologies: An Application of

evaluate appropriate e-commerce frameworks to identify offenders.  
 
d. Limitations and Directions for Future Research 
Like many other studies, this study has some limitations that must be acknowledged. 
First of all, the data collection for the study was done using non-probabilistic approach, 
convenient sampling technique specifically. Thus, the findings of the study cannot be 
generalized to represent the entire population. Secondly, the study did not consider the 
moderating effects of demographic characteristics such as age, gender, educational level, 
income, and experience on how it contributes to the adoption of e-commerce. Future 
research should, therefore, integrate the demographic variables omitted in this study to 
provide a comprehensive understanding of user intentions. Additionally, future research 
may consider cultural dimensions to arrive at a better understanding of the phenomena.
