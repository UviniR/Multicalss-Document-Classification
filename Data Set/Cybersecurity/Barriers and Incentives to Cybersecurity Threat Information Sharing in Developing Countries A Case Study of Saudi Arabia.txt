ABSTRACT
Threat information sharing practices have the potential to improve
cyber security. However, participation in sharing communities is
not widely adopted. The existing literature finds a variety of ben-
efits and challenges that either promote or deter organisations
from engaging in such practices. Many of these findings relate to
developed countries. A gap exists between developed and develop-
ing countries in terms of cyber threat information sharing. In this
paper, we describe a case study to identify the barriers and incen-
tives for implementing threat information sharing in a developing
country: Saudi Arabia. Our results offer insight into the successful
implementation of threat information sharing initiatives in Saudi
Arabia, showing that socio-cultural barriers and technological in-
centives for sharing threat information are important factors. Our
survey tool can be applied in other countries both developed and
developing.

1 INTRODUCTION
Globally, cyberattacks are increasing in frequency, complexity and
sophistication, causing significant security threats to individuals,
organisations and nations [ 1,2]. To increase resilience, organisa-
tions must deal with a growing number of vulnerabilities, threat

viduals to well-resourced organisations that work as part of an
organised criminal group, or on behalf of other nation-states [ 3].
Cyber threats are potentially more harmful and adversaries may
coordinate their attacks. Therefore, coordinated countermeasures
by governments and public and private sectors organisations are
needed to protect valuable national assets.
Cyber threat information sharing is a proactive measure that can
protect against cyberattacks [ 4]. Members of sharing communities
can exchange information that may assist others to detect new at-
tacks or proactively enhance their defences against various type of
threats [5]. The shared information may include attack indicators,
tactics, techniques, and procedures, security alerts, threat intelli-
gence reports, and best practices [ 3]. Threat information sharing
plays a vital role in organisational cyber security readiness [ 6]. It is
one of five essential practices that organisations need to undertake
to protect against cyberattacks; the others are governance, technolo-
gies and techniques, standards and policies, and staff development
[6]. A standard procedure to collect, store and distribute the appro-
priate information between organisations on a homogeneous, rapid,
and practical basis will enhance cyber security. This collaborative
environment enables all members of the sharing community to
act in a coordinated manner [ 7]. In contrast, a complete lack of
threat information sharing will raise the cost of protection against
cyberattacks. Each defender must work individually to identify and
combat each threat [8].
The success of threat information sharing practices relies on
the active participation and commitment of all involved stakehold-
ers: individuals, governments, policymakers, public and private
organisations, and international peers [ 9]. The existing literature
includes several challenges that deter stakeholders from engaging
in threat information sharing practices, such as a lack of awareness
of threat information sharing, concerns about the sort of threat
information that should be shared, and fear of the consequences
of sharing [ 10-13]. To address these challenges, threat information
sharing must be considered within a broader framework covering
multiple aspects affecting stakeholder decisions, including laws
and regulations, social, organisational, technical, economic aspects,
in addition to political and international influence. Understand-
ing these aspects and the interactions are necessary for successful
threat information sharing [14].
Internationally, countries vary in their threat information shar-
ing practices. Some have comprehensive systems in place, but many
do not. Developed countries have often implemented cyber threat
information sharing initiatives, with national frameworks to facili-
tate threat information sharing and international alliances [ 15]. The
Global Cyber security Index (GCI) 2018 report [ 16], published byACSW ’21, February 01–05, 2021, Dunedin, New Zealand Waleed Alkalabi et al.
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU), states that de-
veloped countries including the UK, the US, France, Lithuania, and
Estonia have threat information sharing practices in place. Com-
pared to developed countries, developing countries have a poor
understanding of cyber security [17-19], both in their understand-
ing of the risks posed by cyber threats and the capabilities required
to address those risks [ 19,20]. The GCI 2018 report noted that
half of the 193 ITU member states do not have a published cyber
security strategy and have little or no cyber threat information
sharing. Most of these member states are developing countries in
regions such as Africa, the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Arab states
countries, including Saudi Arabia [ 16]. Developing the capabilities
to implement threat information sharing requires the identification
of factors that limit such practices. Many developing countries de-
pend on developed countries to assist with the developing of their
cyber security technical capabilities [ 21]. However, the solutions
and strategies successfully employed in a developed country may
not be suitable for direct application in developing countries [ 22]. It
is crucial to develop a national threat information sharing strategy
that is relevant to the context of a particular country.
Despite the growing interest in cyber security development and
threat information cooperation in developed and developing coun-
tries, there is a significant lack of studies into the factors affecting
the implementation of cyber threat information sharing in develop-
ing countries. The main purpose of this study is to identify barriers
and incentives with the most significant influence on threat infor-
mation sharing in a case study developing country: Saudi Arabia.
This paper explores these barriers and incentives, as understanding
these is necessary to enable participation in cyber threat informa-
tion sharing practices. We first performed a literature survey to
identify barriers and incentives noted in previous research. We cate-
gorised these in a manner similar to Skopik [ 2], who used technical,
legal, regulatory, and organisational dimensions. Our categorisation
has adapted this to form five categories: legal and regulatory, fi-
nancial, operational, socio-cultural and technological. Our research
seeks to determine the most important factors inhibiting cyber
threat information sharing, including barriers and incentives that
limit or encourage participation in threat information sharing prac-
tices. Understanding these factors will be used as a basis for the
future development of a national cyber security framework for the
successful implementation of threat information sharing for Saudi
Arabia.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section
2 describes the methodology and instruments employed in this
research to perform a literature review identifying the barriers and
incentives to cyber threat information sharing, construct a survey
to identify the most important barriers and incentives, and a case
study where the survey is administered. Section 3 presents the
results of the research. Section 4 discusses the case study findings
and relates the identified important barriers and incentives in five
categories to the context of a developing country: Saudi Arabia.
Section 5 identifies the limitations of this study, and the final section
concludes the paper.2 METHODOLOGY
The study presented in this paper was carried out in three phases.
The first phase was a literature review of barriers and incentives to
cyber threat information sharing. A list of identified barriers and
incentives was derived and categorised: legal and regulatory, fi-
nancial, operational, socio-cultural, and technological. This formed
the basis for an online survey, developed in the second phase, that
will be applied to rate the importance of barriers and incentives in
certain countries. In the third phase, this survey was administered
in the case study country: Saudi Arabia.
2.1 Multivocal Literature Review
In this literature review, we identify barriers and incentives that
influence participation in threat information sharing. The scope
of this review is not limited to a particular country. Due to the
limited number of academic papers on cyber threat sharing, we
used a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) as suggested in [ 23].
This includes documents such as white papers from sources such
as government, national authorities and industry in addition to the
formal literature. This MLR forms the basis for a survey instrument
to be developed in Phase 2.
Many studies in the literature describe research performed in
developed countries that already have a threat information sharing
practice, including the US [ 12,13,24], the UK [ 25], Canada [ 26]
and Europe [ 27]. Some of the findings of these papers may not
be generalised or directly applied to other countries [ 28]. There
may be differences between countries in terms of their laws and
policies, government priorities, socio-economic status, national ICT
infrastructure development level, cyber security maturity level and
availability of technical experts. Therefore, the impact of barriers
and incentives may vary from one country to another.
In our MLR, we first reviewed available literature that addresses
cyber security more broadly and then focused on sharing cyber
threat information. We identified a list of barriers and incentives
from relevant studies in the literature. These research papers were
located by searching literature available on Lecture Notes in Com-
puter Science (LNCS), IEEE Explore, the ACM Digital Library, In-
spec, ProQuest, SpringerLink, and Google scholar as well as Google
search engine. No systematic reviews on cyber threat information
sharing were identified. To improve the quality of this MLR, we
followed the steps of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Re-
views and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [ 29].A list of 113 (84 barriers
and 29 incentives) potential factors were identified. These were then
grouped into five main categories: legal and regulatory, financial,
operational, socio-cultural, and technological.
A three-step search strategy was used in this MLR to locate
related publications for both developing and developed countries.
First, we searched for English language articles published since 2009
in seven major online databases: LNCS, IEEE Explore, the ACM
Digital Library, Inspec, ProQuest, SpringerLink, and ScienceDirect.
Secondly, we searched for grey literature published by widespread
international cyber security and threat information sharing agen-
cies, such as the US Department of Homeland Security, the Euro-
pean Union Agency for Cyber security (ENISA), the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU), and the United States National
Institute of Standards and Technology (including reports, workingBarriers and Incentives to Cybersecurity Threat Information Sharing in Developing Countries ACSW ’21, February 01–05, 2021, Dunedin, New Zealand
papers, government documents, and white papers) [ 30]. Thirdly, we
searched Google Scholar for international articles and conferences
in cyber security and threat information sharing. All retrieved arti-
cles were imported into Endnote software (Version X9, Bld 12062).
Search keywords used were (“cyber security” OR cyber security OR
threat) AND ("information sharing" OR intelligence) AND (factors
OR barriers OR issues OR challenges OR obstacles). The search was
conducted between September and December 2019.
From the initial database and reference list search, we identified
2,397 relevant documents. Of these documents, 2,363 were identified
from academic databases, and 34 were identified from other sources
(nine from international cyber security agencies, nine from cyber
security focused research centres and 16 from international journals
and conferences). A screening process was performed; all duplicate
articles were removed, and documents that did not address factors,
barriers, challenges, obstacles, issues, incentives, or benefits for
cyber threat information sharing were excluded. We screened based
on the article titles and abstracts. As a result of screening, 2,203
documents were excluded from the study, leaving 194 documents
to form the basis of this research.
2.2 Survey development
In the second phase of this study, the list of barriers and incentives
from Phase 1 is used to develop a survey. The survey questions
ask participants to rate the barriers and incentives according to
their perceived importance to threat information sharing in their
organisations on a 5-point Likert scale.
A web-based self-administered survey consisting of two sections
was developed. The first section contains general questions to ex-
plore participants characteristics such as educational qualification,
work experience, and the type of organisation and the sector where
it belongs. The second section asked participants to rate the bar-
riers and incentives from a list of 113 factors (84 barriers and 29
incentives) they believed to be the most critical in the successful
implementation of threat information sharing. Participants were
asked to rate on a scale of one to five, where 1 is "not important"; 2
is "slightly important"; 3 is "moderately important"; 4 is "important";
and 5 is "very important" their opinions related to the importance
of these barriers and incentives. This study received ethics approval
from the QUT Human Research Ethics Committee.
2.3 Case study: Administering the Survey
In Phase 3, we administer the survey developed in Phase 2 in a
developing country: Saudi Arabia. Invitation letters were sent to
500 employees with cyber security roles in public and private sector
organisations in Saudi Arabia. Email reminders were sent to non-
respondents after 28 days. The invitation was accompanied by a
cover letter stating the research aim and explaining how to complete
the survey. This process for obtaining survey respondents may have
introduced a bias, and we accept that as an unavoidable risk in this
research.
Survey data were analysed; statistical analysis was performed
using frequency tables, means and standard deviations (SD) for
key variables. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the
Independent t-test was used to determine the differences in the
mean value for barriers and incentives scores by demographics.Data were checked for normal distribution and homogeneity of
variances using the Levene’s and Shapiro-Wilk’s tests [ 31,32]. All
analyses were carried out using SPSS 18.0. A p-value of <0.05 was
deemed significant.
3 RESEARCH RESULTS
In this section, we first present the barriers and incentives to cyber
threat information sharing found in the literature review performed
in Phase 1, followed by the survey results from Phase 3.
3.1 Multivocal Literature Review (MLR)
The barriers and incentives revealed in the literature review are
grouped into five categories: legal and regulatory, financial, opera-
tional, socio-cultural, and technological. The results are presented
in Table 1
3.2 Survey results
The study involved 500 participants, of whom 137 completed the
survey (response rate: 27.4%). The educational qualification shows
that almost half (48.9%) had a bachelor’s degree or lower, 40.9% had
a Master degree, and only 10.2% had a PhD. Nearly 61% were partici-
pants from information/communication technologies and computer
sciences background, 12.4% engineering, 11.3% business/economics
and 15.3% from other backgrounds. Over one-third had work experi-
ence of≥10 yrs (38.7%) and 6-10 yrs (35%), whereas 26.3% had work
experience of 2-5 yrs. Participants who worked in public organisa-
tions were higher than those who worked in private organisations
(56.9% vs. 43.1%). The highest proportion comprised of those who
worked in the Government/law enforcement sector (24.1%), fol-
lowed by petrochemical manufacturing and oil/gas sector (22.6%).
3.2.1 Ranking cyber threat information sharing categories. To de-
termine which categories of barriers and incentives were most
important, we analysed the data provided for all responses within
each category. Table 2, shows that the all barriers and incentives
categories had a mean value above 3.5, which means they con-
sidered important. Socio-cultural barriers (M =3.90, SD =0.65) and
technological incentives (M =3.93, SD =0.74) were the most impor-
tant categories influencing threat information sharing in Saudi
Arabia. On the other side, financial barriers (M =3.65, SD =0.88) and
incentives (M =3.69, SD =0.86) were the least important categories.
3.2.2 Barriers to cyber threat information sharing in Saudi Arabia.
Table 3 presents the descriptive analyses and shows the top 27 bar-
riers and incentives for sharing threat information in Saudi Arabia
sorted by the mean value. The top three socio-cultural barriers were:
“Lack of training and awareness programs”, “Privacy concerns” and
“Political issues and international relations”. Furthermore, the most
critical legal and regulatory barriers were: “Risk of violating na-
tional security laws”, “Privacy and data protection compliance” and
“Fear of legal and regulatory action”. Additionally, the top three
operational barriers were: “Lack of skilled employees”, “Maintain-
ing the anonymity of participants” and “Poor management within
organisations”. Additionally, the top three technological barriers
were: “Type of information that needs to be shared”, “Confidence
that the information shared is accurate” and “Quality, value and theACSW ’21, February 01–05, 2021, Dunedin, New Zealand Waleed Alkalabi et al.

bia.Table 3 shows the top 27 barriers and incentives for sharing
threat information in Saudi Arabia. "Quality, value and usefulness
of the information shared " and "Increasing the organisation’s sit-
uational awareness" were the most important technological and
operational incentives, respectively. Participants rated “The govern-
ment role is unclear” and "Legal protection to shield organisations
from liability" as the most critical legal and regulatory incentives.
"The exchange of knowledge and expertise" regarded as being the
most critical socio-cultural incentives. At the same time "Decreasedcyber security costs and expert security analysts" was ranked as
the highest financial incentive.
4 DISCUSSION
This survey identified the barriers and incentives that may influence
cyber threat information sharing from the perspective of Saudi
Arabian participants.
4.1 Socio-cultural aspects
The ranking of categories of barriers and incentives shows that
socio-cultural barriers were the most significant deterrent to threat
information sharing, as shown in Table 2. This ranking shows

surrounding the organisations have the most significant impact on
threat information sharing practices in Saudi Arabia. The survey
results showed that the most significant barriers within the socio-
cultural category are insufficient awareness, training, education
and knowledge of cyber security, and these barriers are consideredas the main socio-cultural barriers to threat information sharing,
followed by privacy concerns and confidentiality, then political
problems and international relations.

threat information sharing. This result is consistent with research
findings in the literature for developing countries in Ecuador [ 34]
and Israel [ 43]. It is present but not to the same extent in developed
countries such as the UK [ 2], Estonia [ 44] and the US [ 45]. Training
and education can improve employees’ skills and capabilities and
raises the organisations competency level. A fail in the organisa-
tional training could lead to a failure of threat information sharing
practices.
Respondents acknowledged the lack of cyber security knowledge
in their organisations, in addition to insufficient understanding of
cyber security demands. This result is consistent with previous
studies in Estonia [ 44] and Israel [ 43]. It is therefore important
to take opportunities to increase awareness of cyber security and
threat information sharing. This can be achieved through training
for employees on the importance of threat information sharing as
a cyber security measure.
4.2 Technological aspects
Technology provides some tools to assist the threat information
sharing process by offering structured and secure communications.
These tools help to automate and speed up the exchange, docu-
mentation, analysis, or remediation of threat information between
sharing partners [ 46]. Sharing threat information is of great benefit,
as long as it includes valuable content and is spread in a secure and
structured manner [ 27]. However, there are concerns that may deter
organisations from participating. Threat information can include
sensitive contextual information that could pose a risk to individual
privacy or expose organisational vulnerabilities [ 47]. Sharing part-
ners need assurance that participating in the threat information
sharing process does not increase their cyber risks. To successfully
establish trust between sharing partners, all communications need
to be authenticated and encrypted while in transit and at rest [ 48].
Survey participants acknowledge that the lack of a centralised
system for exchanging threat information is a barrier for threat
information sharing as shown in Table 3. This result is similar
to research findings in the literature in Europe [ 40], the US
[12,49,50] and Vietnam [ 51]. With the expected large amount of
threat information shared, such a system is essential to manage
and share threat information and coordinate response activities
[52]. Therefore, a platform that shares and automate the threat
information exchange process is needed to increase trust between
sharing partners and to encourage organisations to participate in
threat information sharing. Consequently, it will help to provide
means solution to existing critical technological barriers such as
the lack of standard format for sharing, lack of terminology and
taxonomy and lack of technical tools that assist organisations to
choose the best type of shared threat information. Moreover, it
helps to distribute threat information to a large number of sharing
partners in a timely and secure manner.
4.3 Legal and Regulatory aspects
As shown in Table 2, the legal and regulatory aspects were the third
the most important category according to our survey results. Legal
and regulatory aspects are considered to be critical external influ-
ences on the organisations decision to participate in cyber threat
information sharing [ 53]. According to the survey participants, thefear of legal and regulatory actions was the most critical legal and
regulatory barrier. This result is similar to research findings in the
literature for developed countries such as the US who adopted the
Cybersecurity Act of 2015 [ 27], Europe who adopted the Directive
on security of Network and Information Systems (NIS Directive) [ 2].
The absence of cyber security laws, guidelines and regulations could
discourage organisations from participating in threat information
sharing practices as organisations fear that sharing threat infor-
mation might expose them to legal liability and potential lawsuits.
Another significant challenge is compliance with privacy and data
protection laws; the survey respondents find this a significant con-
cern in cyber threat information sharing. This is similar to concerns
expressed in Europe [ 53,54], the UK [ 55] and the US [ 49]. Shared
threat information may include organisations sensitive information
such as intellectual property, trade secrets, or even employee and
customer data. Therefore, there are specific requirements needed
before sharing threat information, all personally identifiable in-
formation such as names, emails, IPs need to be removed [ 49,53].
Similarly, all other enterprises sensitive information that can cause
if leaked financial losses, legal actions, or reputation damage should
be removed before sharing [49].
Our research findings indicate an essential incentive strategy to
overcome legal and regulatory barriers, as shown in Table 3. Legal
protection is required to shield sharing organisations from liability,
similar to the US legislation, where the Cybersecurity Act of 2015
provides protections for organisations that share threat information
[50]. For threat information sharing to be effective, public and
private organisations, academia and cyber security experts should
work jointly with the government to develop cyber security laws,
strategies and guidelines to facilitate threat information sharing and
provide the necessary protection from liability for organisations
that participate in the threat information sharing.
4.4 Operational aspects
Threat information sharing relies on the efficiency of the imple-
mentation of threat information sharing from n operational point
of view [ 13]. This efficiency can vary based on organisations size
and the capability of the available resources to meet the required
cyber security demands. Operational aspects of threat information
sharing include filtering various sources of threat information, ver-
ifying and prioritizing for action. This may be a challenging and
very time-consuming task [13, 56].
Survey respondents acknowledged that one of the most signifi-
cant operational barriers is the lack of skilled employees to handle
threat information sharing tasks. It is a prominent global issue,
most countries suffer including Europe [ 57], the US [ 46,58] and
Saudi Arabia [ 46]. Another significant operational barrier is es-
tablishing a standard format for exchanging threat information
between participants. Standard formats provide a data structure
that solves interoperability issues and has the potential to speed up
the exchange process [ 11]. Examples of available standards include
CybOX [ 59], STIX [ 60], and TAXII [ 61]. The lack of a standard
format for threat information can cause inconsistency and qual-
ity issues. This issue was also noted in the literature for Europe
[27] and the UK [ 62]. The lack of consistency may have negative
impacts on the trust level between sharing participants [ 63]. ThisBarriers and Incentives to Cybersecurity Threat Information Sharing in Developing Countries ACSW ’21, February 01–05, 2021, Dunedin, New Zealand
issue can be resolved by using a platform for threat information
sharing that ensures that information shared is consistent. Besides,
providing specialised training for threat information handlers in
the appropriate use of the platform must be provided.
Results from this study also identified three potential incentive
strategies that may be effective for overcoming operational bar-
riers. The most crucial incentive is creating a shared situational
awareness within public and private sectors organisations. It is es-
sential to inform employees on how to best deal with cyber threats.
Situational awareness helps users in making risk-informed deci-
sions and therefore increases the cyber security resilience against
cyberattacks [ 64]. Moreover, the effectiveness of threat informa-
tion sharing depends on input from experts and collaborations to
represent different cyber security needs. Therefore, threat informa-
tion sharing communities provides the ability for organisations to
receive advanced, trusted advice from various sources [65].
4.5 Financial aspects
As shown in Table 2, survey participants consider financial aspects
of threat information sharing as an essential aspect, but not as im-
portant as the other aspects of threat information sharing that we
discussed in this study. This result could be due to Saudi Arabia’s
strong financial position enabling the country to invest in cyber se-
curity development. This might not be the case in other developing
countries.
Organisations are going to participate in threat information shar-
ing practices if the expected benefits exceeds the costs [ 8,27]. Given
that incidents recovery costs are considered a challenging task and
hard to measure [ 66], it is difficult to determine the intangible costs
of recovery to the organisations as it can include the reputation
damage to the organisation, loss of intellectual property, exposures
of sensitive information that can jeopardise organisation’s privacy
and integrity [ 66]. Threat information sharing is considered to be
a cost-effective solution because it enables organisations to share
the outcome of their resources by sharing knowledge and expert
talents with other organisations. Enabling organisations to work
together in a mutually beneficial way.
The survey participants consider the cost of cyber security tech-
nologies as the main barrier to threat information sharing as shown
in Table 3. The cost can include building information sharing in-
frastructure, buying a data feed, receiving and analysing the data
and hiring cyber security experts [ 13]. Therefore, it is possible to
predict that, by joining an information sharing network, companies
can reduce some of their cyber security costs and strengthen their
cyber security resilience [67, 68].
5 LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY
There are some limitations to this study, including the mode of dis-
tribution. Due to Covid-19 pandemic travel restrictions, potential
participants were approached to complete an online survey using
QUT Key survey online surveying system. We did not employ spe-
cific recruitment strategies that focused on increasing the number
of potential participants. Offering two modes to participants may
increase a survey response rate. Another limitation was that the
validity test of a survey development not conducted. However, in
a second phase of the study, we aim to assess the face validityof a survey, particularly barriers and incentives to sharing threat
information, using structured interviews.
6 CONCLUSION
Cyber threat information sharing is considered as a proactive mea-
sure to improve resilience against emerging cyber threats and at-
tacks. Developed countries have established threat information
sharing programs to protect themselves from emerging cyber
threats and attacks. However, developing countries are still to form
such systems. In this study, we attempted to find the most important
factors affecting organisations decisions to participate in threat in-
formation sharing practices in the case study country: Saudi Arabia.
Understanding these barriers and incentives are crucial move for-
ward into understanding how to best balance between challenges
and benefits to encourage organisations in developing countries to
participate in threat information sharing practices, thus helping in
obtaining the essential factors that decision and policymakers in
Saudi Arabia must pay attention in order to develop an effective
national threat information sharing initiatives.
This paper is the first study to identify contributing barriers and
potential incentives for sharing cyber security threat information
sharing in the Middle East, and Saudi Arabia in particular. The study
presented in this research paper was carried out in three phases.
In this first phase, we performed a literature review to identify
cyber threat information barriers and incentives. In this second
phase, we developed a survey based on the identified barriers and
incentives. In the third phase, we administered the online survey
in the developing country: Saudi Arabia to find the most important
barriers and incentives. Socio-cultural barriers and technological
incentives for sharing cyber threat information sharing were the
most important categories.
