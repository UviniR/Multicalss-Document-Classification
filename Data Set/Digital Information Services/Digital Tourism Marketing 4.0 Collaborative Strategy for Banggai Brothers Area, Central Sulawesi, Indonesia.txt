1. INTRODUCTION 
 
 
Industrial Revolution 4.0 shows the progress of 
the industry 
globally. It is marked by each 
country's efforts to increase its competitiveness 
in their respective countries to face the global 
market. Industry 4.0 applies the principles of 
interoperability, virtualization, decentralization, 
real
-
time capabilities, ser
vice
-
oriented, and 
modular, which aims to increase product value 
[1]. The benefits of industry 4.0 include the speed 
of product development, increased productivity, 
increased consumer service, and increased 
income, which directly impacts a country [2]. And
 
it is also considered to be more profitable for 
business people in terms of operational cost
-
efficient. There is a belief that this revolution will 
benefit business people because it can cut 
production and distribution costs, especially if the 
actors can 
create an effective and efficient 
collaboration ecosystem [3] and continuously for 
all industrial sectors. All industrial sectors are 
affected by the 4.0 industrial revolution, including 
the tourism sector industry [1].
 
 
The tourism sector is one of the in
dustries with 
the most profitable economic growth globa
lly. 
Supported by a report from 
the World Travel and 
Tourism Council (WTTC), the tourism industry 
accounts for 10.4% of the world's GPD, making it 
one of the largest economic sectors worldwide 
[4]. The
 
management of each country's tourism 
sector, from planning and implementation to 
supervision, is crucial, including the marketing of 
tourism products currently shifting to digital 
marketing.
 
 
Along with the emergence of the industrial 
revolution 4.0, digi
tal marketing has also 
experienced rapid development, namely 
marketing 4.0. Marketing 4.0 is horizontal, 
inclusive, and social that focuses on humanity in 
the digital era. It combines online and offline 
interactions, besides integrating style and 
substance
, which means that the brand 
                 
puts forward good branding and relevant content 
[5].
 
 
Over the past few years, it can be seen that 
marketing trends have fluctuated. Several 
companies have widely used marketing trends in 
the digital era, such 
as banner ads, video ads, 
and native ads. This marketing trend is predicted 
to become more prevalent due to broader 
internet access without time limitation. Based on 
a survey in 2019, many companies budgeted 
50% of the total advertising costs for digital 
a
dvertising via telephone [6]. This marketing is 
also a new marketing strategy that is often used, 
including in the tourism sector.
 
 
The concept of tourism marketing is where 
marketers and managers of tourism destinations 
play a role in facilitating 
sustainable actions and 
behaviors in tourism development [7]. Marketing 
4.0 not only prioritizes branding, but the content 
displayed in marketing must be relevant and 
good [5]. Marketing 4.0 uses the internet, where 
the internet has become a part of human 
life, 
especially in Indonesia. Indonesia not only has 
the potential to become a large consumer in the 
world market but has the potential to become a 
powerhouse for the world's digital economy. The 
data shows that Indonesia is quite significant in 
coloring 
competition in the world's digital world. 
As the country with the highest internet access 
globally, the country with the third
-
highest 
internet growth in the world, and large 
consumption of internet access time with an 
average of 8 hours a day [8]. It is a
 
potential that 
the industry can use to focus more on increasing 
digital marketing.
 
 
Therefore, the development of digital marketing 
for Indonesian tourism should be carried out 
comprehensively in Indonesia, especially in 
Indonesia's underdeveloped tourist
 
areas. One of 
the tourist areas that need to be improved is the 
Banggai area, which consists of Banggai Luwuk 
Regency, Banggai Islands Regency, and 
Banggai Laut Regency. The proud site is part of 
Central Sulawesi Province, a province with a 
much lower lev
el of tourist visits than the 
provinces of South Sulawesi and North Sulawesi,

and so on [9]. The contribution of regional 
revenue from tourism to the Banggai Area is still 
low, below 10% [10]. There are two main 
problems faced. First, the problem is caused
 
by 
the low quality of human resources in tourism 
due to the low education and tourism kn
owledge 
level. Second, problems 
in implementing the 
tourism promotion communication strategy by the 
Banggai Regency Tourism Office via the internet. 
Tourism promotion 
is not optimal yet, and not 
innovative enough so that its reach is minimal 
[11].
 
 
The Banggai area (Banggai Luwuk, Banggai 
Islands, and Banggai Laut) can be an 
inseparable unit, each of which has attractive 
tourism potential and can be developed and 
compet
e with other destinations in Indonesia. 
The development stage requires marketing 
strategies that can be applied effectively and 
efficiently. One of the strategies that can be 
implemented is collaborative marketing or 
cooperation, aiming to enhance or stren
gthen the 
cooperation network between the government, 
private sector, and society. This study analyzes 
digital tourism marketing obstacles in the 
Banggai brothers (Banggai Luwuk, Banggai 
Islands, Banggai Laut), Central Sulawesi. This 
study analyzes the dig
ital marketing strategies 
applied and formulate an effective collaborative 
digital tourism marketing strategy used in the 
Banggai brothers in the future. 
 
 
Several studies on tourism in the Banggai area 
include researching the landscape planning of 
tourist
 
areas [12], and the tourism information 
system.  The studies show that tourism data 
management in Banggai Islands Regency and 
the dissemination of tourist information are still 
manual [
13]. Last, 
study the role of government 
in tourism management [14]. 
 
 
Regarding digital marketing research, there has 
been quite a lot of discussion about digital 
marketing connected to the tourism sector. Using 
digital marketing, marketers can reach a global 
audience without a barrier [15]. The internet has 
helped reduce co
sts and improve customers' 
services in the travel and tourism sector [16]. 
Thi
s work focus on digital tourism 
marketing in 
the Banggai Area, to fill the gaps. 
 
 
2. LITERATURE REVIEW
 
 
2.1 
Digital Marketing
 
 
Digital marketing utilizes application technology 
media that focuses on positioning personal, 
corporate, and product brands; increase brand 
equity; product and process development, 
internal and external marketing. It is also used to 
conduct consumer resear
ch because, at the 
same time, it provides direct contact with its 
customers through several activities such as 
social media, blogging, and online communities 
[17]. Digital marketing is closely connected to 
consumers, especially young people because it 
is i
ntegrated into their media content and their 
social and personal relationships [18].
 
 
Digital marketing affects various aspects of 
consumer behavior, including brand awareness, 
access to information, opinions, attitudes, 
purchasing behavior, post
-
purchase 
communication, and evaluation of these different 
aspects to improve the company's competitive 
position and ultimately lead to increased sales. 
For example, digital marketing strategies and 
tactics affect both the volume and valence of 
online reviews and, i
ndirectly, hotel performance 
[19]. There is a lot of research that supports an 
effective digital marketing strategy in today's 
market and is a new element of the marketing 
promotion mix [17].
 
 
The era of digital marketing with the internet 
continues to evo
lve. Marketing Evolution 1.0 
focuses on selling products without thinking 
about consumer needs. Marketing 2.0 is 
consumer
-
oriented, which refers to centralized 
management decisions and the low variety of 
consumer behavior called Decentralized 
Marketing Sys
tems [20]. Marketing 3.0 is human
-
oriented by democratic marketing systems, which 
refers to centralized management decisions and 
various consumer behavior [20]. Marketing 4.0 
combines online and offline strategies to get 
customer engagement [5]. In other w
ords,  
Collaborative Market Systems which focus on the 
involvement of all related parties have an equal 
share in the creation of commercial value of 
products, where there is a diversity of behavior of 
market participants, and the regulation is self
-
managed
 
loosely / decentralized [20].
 
 
2.2 
Marketing 4.0
 
 
Marketing 4.0 is horizontal, inclusive, and social 
that focuses on humanity in the digital era, which 
means combining interactions between online 
and offline, besides integrating external 
appearance and co
ntent, which means that the 
brand puts forward good branding and relevant 
content [5]. Consumers today are not only 
looking for products to meet their needs. Still, 
they 
are looking for satisfaction, channeling their

creativity and values socially, such as
 
participating, interacting with products, sharing 
experiences, and reviewing product usage [21]. 
A close relationship is formed between 
consumers and products; it is expected to create 
loyalty and increase purchases. Marketing 4.0 
uses various marketing c
hannels to create a 
smooth and consistent consumer experience. By 
using multiple channels, consumers can easily 
recognize and access product or service 
information [22].
 
 
Marketing 4.0 ensures that they rely on online 
marketing activities. Still, entrepren
eurs must 
take an offline approach, such as establishing 
relationships with consumers related to the 
products or services offered. Marketing 4.0 
focuses on forming digital branding with the 5A 
approach, namely [5]:
 
 
1.
 
Aware, this stage approaches the 
consumer knowing the existence of the 
brand or product being sold.
 
2.
 
The Appeal, a continuation of the previous 
stage were at this stage consumers begin 
to feel attracted to the products being sold; 
there is a need for these products so that 
the desire to bu
y will emerge.
 
3.
 
Ask, the stage of searching for in
-
depth 
information about the product, making 
comparisons with other products, then 
being sure.
 
4.
 
Act, at this stage, the consumer finally 
buys the product.
 
5.
 
Advocate, after using the product and 
feeling the ben
efits of satisfaction, 
consumers will provide feedback on 
product reviews and recommend relatives' 
products.
 
 
Marketing 4.0 focuses on forming digital branding 
with marketing content that attracts consumers 
with various media application technologies.
 
 
2.3
 
Content Marketing
 
 
Content marketing can help consumers with 
intermediaries in any media convey producer 
messages that have credible characteristics, 
shareable, useful or fun, interesting, relevant, 
and different on the brand [23]. Content 
marketing creat
es and distributes relevant, 
attractive, obtains content and engages a clearly 
defined and understood target audience to get 
consumers' attention, then focusing and 
interested in learning more about the products 
being sold [24].
 
Content marketing is useful
 
for increasing brand 
awareness, building consumer confidence in 
products, creating needs for certain products so 
that new prospects emerge, increasing consumer 
loyalty, testing new product ideas [24]. Content 
marketing maintains readers' attention, and 
in
creases brand loyalty, and shares it through all 
media [25]. The importance of content marketing 
has been shown in several previous studies, 
among others. Most consumers feel content 
marketing helps them make better purchasing 
decisions and tend to buy pro
ducts from 
companies that provide product content 
marketing [24].
 
 
Some of the most common types of content are 
website articles; news; case study; White paper; 
blog; video; mobile application; mobile content; 
testimonials; e
-
book; infographics; picture; o
nline 
presentation; annual report; research papers; 
recorded audio discussion/podcast [23]. In 
creating content marketing, several things need 
to be considered to be effective and efficient. 
What needs to be considered in content 
marketing, namely;
 
 
1.
 
Audien
ce. Set goals for the target 
audience, who will see content marketing 
[23]. Create a close relationship with the 
audience or consumer. In other words, the 
social foundation, the audience, or 
consumers who provide feedback, share 
experiences using the produ
ct will attract 
other audiences [24].
 
2.
 
Fill in content. Set an interesting topic, 
focus on quality content [24] 
 
3.
 
Widespread and plural. Use a wide variety 
of media and written content such as 
images, videos, infographics, checklists, 
audio content, webinars
, and even live 
events [24]. Extend the reach, not only on 
its website, based on Content Marketing 
Institute research showing that the most 
ineffective type of content is publishing on 
its website [23].
 
4.
 
Experts. Experts are needed to create 
content, includ
ing strategy analysis, market 
analysis, branding, content creators, and 
other supporting personnel [23].
 
 
Monitoring of content marketing performance is 
carried out by engaging with audiences who 
respond to the content and potential prospects or 
industry stakeholders with monitor metrics [24]; 
 
 
1.
 
Consumption metrics (Google Analytics, 
Traffic, Open Rates). Such as visit to the 
company's site, page views, newsletter

2.4 
Tourism Marketing
 
 
Tourism marketing is carried out by tourism 
institutions, including activities to innovate, 
communicate, deliver, and share tourist product 
offerings to customers, partners, and 
c
ommunities [26]. Tourism marketing is an 
important element in designing strategies and 
communication by following the target market. 
Marketers and managers of tourism destinations 
play a role in facilitating sustainable actions and 
behaviors in tourism dev
elopment [7]. Tourism 
marketing includes identifying and evaluating 
tourist product offerings, focusing on target 
tourists, determining market choices [27], 
focusing on tourism products or services and 
their development, and fair pricing policies and 
integ
rated distribution channels to target markets 
[26]. In tourism marketing, pay attention to 
modifying the seven elements of the tourism 
marketing mix: tourism products, tourism product 
prices, tourism placement/distribution, tourism 
promotion, people/indivi
duals, service delivery 
processes, and customer service [26]. It is 
necessary to plan an effective and efficient 
tourism marketing strategy.
 
 
The tourism marketing strategy includes three 
phases: 
Planning
, implementation, and control 
[28]. The planning pha
se includes needs 
analysis, research and analysis [28] and 
prognosis [
29
]; The implementation phase 
includes creative infusion, strategic positioning, 
marketing plan development and training, 
implementation [
30
] including determining the 
budget and activit
y plan [
29
] then the control 
phase includes evaluation and adjustment [
30
] 
where this phase shows the feedback from the 
marketing process that has been carried out so 
that it can make future adjustments as needed 
[28]. 
 
 
Tourism marketing is related to 
government, 
society, and other parties connected to public 
management. Public management general 
aspects of management planning, organizing, 
and controlling, from the one hand, with human, 
financial, physical, information
, and political 
resources [
31
]. 
Pub
lic tourism management 
connects tourism stakeholders to co
-
management. Public management is related to 
public policies regulated by the government by 
taking into account the community's interests 
[
32
].
 
 
The management of tourism in Indonesia still 
does not
 
pay attention to the tourism industry's 
strategic role and has not prioritized public 
policies on tourism development [
32
]. The 
partnership pattern between the government, the 
community, and the private sector is still unclear 
[
32
]. Suppose the current co
ndition of society is 
increasingly critical and digital conditions that are 
evenly distributed in all fields. In that case, the 
government is expected to use a new vision in 
tourism management. Tourism must be managed 
based on local interests, involving th
e community 
and the distribution of authority and the 
distribution of authority for the community it is 
important to put forward; this is known as 
democratic governance [
32
]. So collaboration 
between parties is needed in tourism 
management.
 
 
Collaboration 
between parties in tourism 
management will increase the added value that 
tourists can get. Added value is in the form of 
social and economic changes that increase the 
public's positive value on the quality, efficiency, 
or ability of government and tourism 
administrators [
33
]. This value will affect more 
people or private parties who wish to further 
partner with the government to advance tourism. 
 
 
Collaboration between stakeholders is important 
to plan and manage the destination [
34
]. There 
are several stak
eholders involved in managing 
the destination, especially in marketing
—
first, the 
central and local governments are responsible 
for providing the policy. Next, industry or NGO, 
education institutions for research and 
development support [
34
], and the last 
is the 
community. Marketing collaboration using digital 
media is also needed to support the sharing 
economy. 
 
 
Sharing economy means using an internet 
platform optimized to collaborate with all 
stakeholders [
35
], where communities and 
industries focus on 
producing to support the 
government's public services. Government 
creates public policies for the communities 
related to tourism [
35
].
 
 
 
3. METHODS
 
 
The research was conducted by collecting data 
and information directly from respondents.

depth interviews, observation, and 
documentation. Qualitative interviews contain 
open
-
ended questions that are flexible, in
-
depth, 
and detailed so that informants can put forward 
clearly [7]. Interview questions include the
 
constraints of digital tourism marketing for The 
Banggai brothers area (Banggai Luwuk, Banggai 
Islands, Banggai Laut), Central Sulawesi faced 
by the Tourism Office and destination managers, 
current society and tourists, marketing strategies 
that have been
 
implemented so far, as well as 
hopes and suggestions. From informants in 
digital tourism marketing The Banggai brothers 
area (Banggai Luwuk, Banggai Islands, Banggai 
Laut), Central Sulawesi
. 
 
 
The informants were selected with the 
consideration that they 
would provide the best 
data and information [
36
]. In this study, the 
informants were the regional tourism officers 
from the three Banggai brothers consist of nine 
officers, six managers of several tourist 
destinations, ten local people, and ten tourists.
 
 
 
Data were collected in February
-
June 2020 in the 
Banggai area of Central Sulawesi. The selection 
of research locations is based on several 
considerations. Banggai area is potentially 
becoming one of Indonesia's tourist destinations, 
ranging from natural, 
cultural, and local culinary 
tourism. Maybe there are many more potential 
tourism needs to be explored. Another reason is 
that place interests the researchers to analyze.
 
 
Data analysis was performed using The 
Grounded analysis, namely: Data Reduction, 
Data Display, and Conclusion 
Drawing/Verification. The Grounded analysis 
systematically considers collecting data and 
sequentially, allowing the research process to 
cover all potential aspects relevant to the topic 
under study [
37
].  
 
 
4. RESULTS AND DISCU
SSION
 
 
4.1 Results
 
 
Based on the results of field findings through 
interviews and observations with the regional 
tourism office, tourist destination managers, local 
communities, and tourists in destinations in the 
Banggai area, there were several obstacles
 
in 
tourism marketing in the field. The following are 
some of the results of interviews with informants;
 
 
4.1.1 
In
-
depth interview with key informants
 
 
Regional tourism office informants and 
tourist destination managers: 
Based on 
interviews with regional tourism offices and 
tourist destination managers, the Banggai 
Brothers Area's dominant problem is tourism's 
limited human resources (HR). Also, digital 
marketing has not been optimal, and the 
allocated budget is still limited. In s
trengthening 
the analysis, researchers made observations 
related to marketing analysis carried out by the 
regional tourism office and tourism destination 
managers. 
 
 
"
Overall, the tourism development here, in 
my opinion, is still stagnant, especially the 
l
ack of community management and 
involvement. It is all related to human 
resources and community support; for 
example, there is the development of 
cottages, but those who manage it also don't 
know who and existing institutions such as 
POKDARWIS only occasio
nally
" (Labawo, 
2019).
 
 
 
"
If the main problem is the limited human 
resources, then the synergy between related 
OPDs is still lacking. In terms of marketing, 
so far, it is still promoting through 
cooperation with national TV, making videos 
of collaboration 
with several higher education 
and private institutions
” (Sara, 2019).
 
 
"
So far, the problem is the limited human 
resources in the tourism sector. The budget 
is also minimal, and the Political Will / 
Partisanship of regional leadership to make 
regional deve
lopment a priority. From the 
marketing strategies we have implemented 
include cooperation with private TV media, 
such as Trans TV. Trans7, TV One, Kompas, 
MNC, and print media but still not maximally”
 
(Londa, 2019).
 
 
"
Marketing online or using social media is not 
effective enough or a priority, because the 
experts here are still 
minimal" (Moidady, 
2019).
 
 
Marketing that has been carried out by the 
Banggai Tourism Office is a digital marketing and 
social media. Marketing
 
has been done through 
the Website, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter. 
However, activities have not been carried out 
actively due to the lack of interaction between 
tourism managers and potential tourists. The 
social media users are also not well managed, so 
th
e use of the internet as a marketing tool is not 
optimal. The marketing management of the 
Banggai Luwuk and Banggai Laut tourism offices 
is less active in marketing through social media.

Unlike the  Banggai Islands, the manager is quite 
active in marketing
 
activities on social media. It 
can be seen from the interaction, the novelty of 
information, and many followers on social media. 
Based on research data, the Banggai Islands 
tourism office's marketing management is the 
most active among the other two Bangg
ai
            
Areas.
 
 
Tourist Informants
: 
Based on several tourist 
statements, marketing problems in the Banggai 
area are related to facilities, accessibility, and 
tourism information, which is still very minimal 
and difficult to access. The arrangement an
d 
management of destinations are not optimal. 
 
 
“
One of the things that make me and my 
friends lazy to travel here (Salodik Waterfall 
Tourism Object) is that sometimes the staff 
or officers at the location are not available. 
Sometimes, the tickets are paid
 
at different 
prices.  Even when I rent a gazebo on the 
same day, the price can vary
” (Siska, 2019).
 
 
"
Sometimes, I don't know there are new 
tours in my city because the information I get 
on the internet is limited
" (Frans, 2019).
 
 
"
We, local people, are s
ometimes lazy to 
travel here, apart from the difficult access, 
uploading (social media) is also less 
attractive
" (Egi, 2019).
 
 
"
I prefer to have a vacation to Makassar as 
well, easy access and information obtained 
from the internet is also easy
" (Maulana, 
2019).
 
 
Local Community Informants
: 
Based on the 
local community's statements, people around 
tourist destinations prefer to work in other sectors 
than tourism. For example, they prefer to be 
fishermen, trade food and beverages, or work 
outside the city. So
 
far, they feel they have not 
received a positive impact from tourism in their 
area to create negative tourism perceptions. It 
means that the level of tourism awareness of the 
Banggai community is still low.
 
 
"
I prefer to be a fisherman rather than work 
he
re (a tourist spot) because the results are 
immediate Itand there is no need to wait
" 
(Rahmat, 2019).
 
 
"
Yes, sometimes there is counseling about 
tourism, and we all come, but after arriving, it 
turns out to be not that interesting, so we 
prefer to go home 
and work
" (Anto, 2019).
 
 
"
I choose to work outside the city rather than 
working here (the Tourism Office) because 
the bureaucracy is busy
" (Angga, 2019).
 
 
"
The impact of tourism here is not very 
significant, bro, so I prefer to trade drinks 
here, sometimes
 
official officers are rarely 
seen at work
." (Nur, 2019).
 
 
4.1.2
 
Result of observation related to 
marketing in B
anggai Area 
 
 
The results of observations were made to 
validate the information from key informants. In 
the three Banggai areas, digital marketing has 
not been carried out optimally. There has been 
no visible engagement with tourists regarding the 
use of social media. T
he digital media used in 
marketing throughout the Banggai area are the 
Website, Facebook, and Instagram. Only 
Banggai Kepulauan
 
uses Youtube. Activities on 
social media are scarce because managers do 
not upload new content regularly. However, 
when compared
 
to the other two Banggai areas, 
Banggai Kepulauan
 
is the most active in using 
social media in its marketing. The types of social 
media in the Banggai area as marketing media 
can be seen in Table 1.
 
 
4.2 
Discussion
 
 
Tourism management requires good 
management planning. One of the planning is 
public management, which includes general 
aspects of management such as planning, 
organizing, and controlling, from the one hand, 
with human, financial, physical, information, and 
political resources [
31
]. The ma
nagement of 
tourism in Indonesia is still considered to have 
not paid attention to the tourism industry's 
strategic role. It has not prioritized public policies 
towards tourism development [
32
]. If it is related 
to the current state of society that is incr
easingly 
critical, the government is expected to use a new 
vision in managing tourism. Tourism must be 
managed based on local interests, involving the 
community and the private sector and the 
distribution of resources and distribution of 
management authori
ty for the community is 
important to be put forward. This is known as 
democratic governance [
32
]. With the added 
value that influences the stimulus of social and 
economic change, increasing public value on the 
quality, efficiency, or ability of governance 
and 
services, in the future, it will be easier to invite 
people to partner with the government towards 
civil society [
33
].

Based on interviews and observations with the 
regional tourism office, tourist destination 
managers, local communities, and tourists in 
destinations in the Banggai area, the dominant 
problem related to tourism development is the 
limited tourism human resou
rces. Human 
resources are important in tourism management, 
starting from planning, organizing, implementing, 
and monitoring. The limited quantity and quality 
of human resources impact tourism management 
and operation in the whole Banggai Area.
 
 
The limited
 
quantity of human resources referred 
to is the minimum number of human resources in 
managing tourism in the Banggai Area. Lack of 
human resources at regional tourism offices and 
tourist destinations has resulted in tourism 
destination management activitie
s, not satisfying 
tourists. Marketing activities are less effective in 
attracting tourists. The absence of driving the 
concept of tourism awareness in the local 
community makes tourist destinations less 
positive on the surrounding community. 
Meanwhile, the
 
limited quality of human 
resources in question is limited knowledge in 
managing tourist objects such as destination 
management and appropriate marketing 
strategies to be used at this time.
 
 
This is supported by previous research results 
regarding the weak
nesses of the tourism office of 
Banggai Luwuk Regency in having a low level of 
education, which affects the management of the 
quality and quantity of tourism products offered 
[11]. Various things in tourism are always 
changing. This has contributed signifi
cantly to 
changes in tourism operators' skills and service 
demands [
38
]. As well as the low awareness of 
tourism in the local community, the lack of 
understanding of the concept of tourism 
awareness causes tourism can't develop 
effectively. The budget for 
promotion is one of 
the obstacles. Human resources in tourism 
marketing, namely stakeholders, partners, and 
local communities, must have the will and ability 
to utilize collective knowledge assets from the 
sustainability of destinations in the global marke
t 
[26].
 
 
Another problem is accessibility to tourist sites 
where transportation is difficult and quite 
expensive to become a problem for tourists to 
visit tourist sites. Road facilities to tourist objects 
are still damaged, and there is no notification of 
tourist locations. Information about tourism in the 
location is still minimal. This is related to 
promotion or marketing that has not been 
maximally carried out by the local tourism office. 
The rise of tourism in the Banggai area has not 
spread widely to t
he general public, both in 
Sulawesi and other cities. Ineffective tourism 
management can be seen from several facilities 
and infrastructure that have not been categorized 
at a good or standard level. The local tourism 
office's administrative management has
 
not been 
implemented optimally. It is shown in several 
tourist attractions in the absence of legal fees 
given to visitors, and in some tourist locations, 
sometimes the price given varies by each visitor. 
This is included in the coverage of tourist product
 
points offered to consumers. This is included in 
the coverage of tourist product points offered to 
consumers. Tourism products are anything that 
can be given to the market to meet consumer 
wants/needs, including natural conditions, 
services, tourism facil
ities, and many others. This 
is included in the coverage of tourist product 
points offered to consumers. Tourism products 
are anything that can be given to the market to 
meet consumer wants/needs, including natural 
conditions, services, tourism facilities,
 
and many 
others [26]. In addition to the obstacles in 
marketing that were found, researchers 
conducted a marketing analysis that has been 
carried out so far.
 
 
The marketing analysis carried out by the tourism 
agency, namely digital marketing and social 
me
dia only through the Website, Facebook, 
Instagram, Twitter, has not been utilized 
maximally, so it has an ineffective marketing 
impact. Meanwhile, digital marketing focuses on 
positioning personal, company, and product 
brands; increase brand equity; produc
t and 
process development, internal and external 
marketing. It is also used to conduct consumer 
research because, at the same time, it provides 
direct contact with its customers through several 
activities such as social media, blogging, and 
online communit
ies [17]. Based on the interview 
results, it was found that the dominant problem in 
marketing analysis was related to the constraints

of responsible and reliable human resources in 
digital marketing plans. It's resulted in ignorance 
or confusion of the peo
ple in charge. Experts are 
needed to create content marketing, including 
strategy analysis, market analysis, branding, 
content creators, and other supporting personnel 
[23]. Therefore we need the right marketing 
strategy that includes answers to human 
reso
urce problems and marketing techniques. In 
doing content marketing, a team of experts is 
needed, including strategy analysis, market 
analysis, branding, content creators, and other 
supporting personnel [23].
 
 
The digital collaboration tourism marketing 
strategy or social media that will be aimed at the 
Banggai Brothers area includes three phases, 
namely planning, implementation, and control 
[28]; 
 
 
1.
 
Planning Phase. The analysis of the 
Banggai Area's marketing ne
eds is to 
select qualified human resources in 
management and operations, including all 
parties involved in the implementation of 
tourism activities in the Banggai Area, 
namely the regional tourism office, tourism 
destination managers, and the local 
communi
ty. The next step is to conduct 
research and analyze solutions to the 
Banggai Area's marketing problems so far. 
The result shows that the dominant 
problem is the limited human resources for 
tourism in this area. Still, suppose The 
Banggai have to use human
 
resources 
from outside the area. In that case, it is 
deemed less effective and efficient, so that 
you should take advantage of existing 
human resources by improving quality.
 
 
The solution that researchers can offer is to use 
a collaborative market system.
 
Establish an 
agreement to cooperate (collaboration) with all 
related tourism stakeholders, including the 
regional tourism office, tourism managers, local 
communities, and tourists. The Banggai Area's 
regional tourism office coordinates employees 
who are q
ualified for the marketing department. 
The representatives of tourist destination 
managers who will be given training on 
management and digital marketing techniques 
must follow the current 4.0 era, for the local 
community to form a Komunitas Sadar Wisata 
(
Tourism awareness community) that focuses on 
supporting regional tourism with various 
campaigns and training and direct community 
approaches. This community can create tourism 
support businesses in the Banggai area, such as 
selling traditional souvenirs or
 
traditional food in 
the Banggai area. For tourists as consumers also 
need to be involved in this collaborative system. 
Tourists' involvement can promote potential 
tourists by inviting travel bloggers, tourism 
observers, YouTubers, and various other 
influe
ncers. They will review the Banggai Area's 
tourist experiences that they have experienced in 
blog posts, websites, YouTube, or any other 
digital medium that many of their followers will 
see. The involvement of all parties is consistent 
with the concept of 
a collaborative market 
system. 
 
 
The concept of a collaborative market system 
focuses on all stakeholders' involvement having 
an equal share in creating the product's 
commercial value. There is a diversity of market 
participants' behavior, and the arrangem
ents are 
loosely managed/ decentralized [20]. In other 
words, all related parties manage their 
management but remain in the same direction as 
to form tourism products to be commercialized. It 
is known as the sharing economy. Some studies 
show that the shar
ing economy produces results 
that satisfy all parties, confusing commercial, and 
non
-
commercial logic objectives such as forming 
social communities that achieve commercial 
purposes [20].  
 
 
Collaboration between regional tourism offices 
and destination man
agers needs to be improved, 
such as tourism facilities, proper human 
resources placement, and sustainable marketing. 
Those who also involve the local community, 
such as tourism promotion, also showcase the 
potential for souvenirs or specialties of the 
Bang
gai Region that can be found around tourist 
destinations. It is shown to selected tourists as 
promoters, namely travel bloggers, tourism 
observers, traveling YouTubers, and various 
other influencers. This collaboration is intended 
to be able to help each o
ther in improving 
tourism in the Banggai area. Also, the purpose of 
this collaboration is one way to strengthen the 
brotherhood ties between districts. Another thing 
is to facilitate tourism promotion and marketing 
simultaneously, fairly, and prosperously 
to 
advance tourism. Moreover, increasing the level 
of existing visits in this region by utilizing 
technological advances, internet, digital that 
focuses on social media and is expected to 
improve the people's economy around tourism 
objects. After the colla
boration agreement, the 
next step is the implementation phase, which is 
essential "Content Marketing," a fully responsible 
team for all activities carried out in the world of 
digital marketing. Digital focuses on social media

and is expected to improve the
 
economy of the 
community around tourism objects.
 
 
2.
 
Implementation Phase. The 
implementation phase includes creative 
infusion, strategic positioning, marketing 
plan development and training, 
implementation [29], including determining 
a budget and activity p
lan [
29
]. The 
Banggai Area marketing strategy's creative 
infusion is fully responsible for all activities 
carried out in digital marketing. Following 
the current marketing era 4.0, digital 
marketing is the best solution in marketing 
all goods and services,
 
especially tourism 
products. Digital marketing is not affected 
by distance and time because it can be 
done anytime, anywhere. The most 
important thing is the availability of a 
quality internet network. The Banggai area 
certainly has a fairly good internet
 
network 
availability. Banggai area tourism content 
marketing with credible characteristics; 
shareable; useful or fun; interesting; 
relevant; different; the brand will include 
strategy analysis, market analysis, 
branding, content creators, and other 
suppor
tive personnel [23]. Analysis of 
several alternative contents that will be 
used. Such as, historical information of the 
tourist destinations in the Banggai Area 
can be created with animation. Tourist map 
information must include all tourist facilities 
or a
udio promotional recordings to be 
broadcast on local radio or other media. It 
is then continued with an analysis of 
market trends by looking at people's 
current activities, for example, things that 
are viral or are being discussed as part of 
content creati
on. The role of the content 
creator is critical at this phase. 
 
 
Content creators take care of all digital marketing 
needs, such as content, determining what type of 
media to use appropriate and suitable. Digital 
marketing or online marketing is meant to f
ocus 
on social media, the results of which are photos, 
videos, and so on. The Banggai Area's tourism 
digital marketing will include collaboration with 
tourism stakeholders, namely the regional 
tourism office with destination managers, to 
determine marketin
g strategies that involve the 
local community as tourism supporters. The unity 
of this collaboration is shown to selected tourists 
as promoters, namely travel bloggers, tourism 
observers, Traveling YouTubers, and various 
other influencers in the form of th
e content 
displayed in various digital marketing media such 
as social media. The form of the Banggai 
region's tourism digital marketing strategy can be 
seen in Fig.
 
1.
 
 
In Fig. 1, digital marketing strategy 4.0 includes 
the initial phase of collaboration 
between tourism 
stakeholders in the Banggai area who have 
planned target goals, determining the position of 
the current proud area of tourism, planning for 
interaction between stakeholders, analyzing 
tourist visits so far, tourism growth, determining 
super
ior tourist areas, establishing target tourists. 
It is followed by a content marketing formation 
phase that involves content creators in various 
digital media, such as websites and social media.
 
 
Digital marketing or online marketing [39], can be 
supported
 
by offline marketing such as marketing 
by holding events held in collaboration with 
various sponsors with certain themes, such as 
local food cooking competitions with raw 
materials typical of the Banggai Laut area with 
instant sponsorship seasoning produc
ts. 
Information on this competition becomes content 
material broadcast on various digital marketing 
media such as websites, social media, 
Facebook, Instagram, and other media. This 
offline marketing can be managed directly by the 
agency. It is also possibl
e to collaborate with 
existing content creator teams who are then 
packaged more attractively to attract tourists 
from all regions and even from other cities. Here, 
content creators' role is significant as a bridge 
between related parties and potential tour
ists 
from all over. After implementing digital tourism 
marketing, the proud area is continued with a 
control phase to maintain marketing 
sustainability.
 
 
3.
 
Control phase. The control phase includes 
evaluation and adjustment [
30
]. As 
previously discussed, dig
ital media in 
marketing is essential in the current 
marketing era 4.0. However, it is still a 
need for an evaluation of the effectiveness 
of this marketing. The effectiveness of 
digital tourism marketing in the Banggai 
Area with various content created is 
by 
seeing how interested social media users 
are and potential prospects or industry 
stakeholders in responding to the Banggai 
Area tourism content. This supervision 
uses monitor metrics [24], namely, 
Consumption metrics (Google Analytics, 
Traffic, Open Rat
es). Such as visits to the 
company's site; page views; the number of 
newsletter subscribers; followers on social 
media; bounce rate; time spent on the company 'site; Sharing metrics (Retweets, 
Forwards, Likes); Lead metrics (Leads 
generated) and Sales metr
ics (Deals). 
 
The results of monitoring metrics in the Banggai 
Area's tourism digital marketing media that have 
been evaluated will produce conclusions on the 
effectiveness of this digital marketing type. 
Further steps can be adjusted in the future, such 
as improving existing content, changing the type 
of content used, or other adjustments such as 
innovations for marketing development.
 
Development innovations that can be done are 
collaborating directly with local start
companies such as Draiv. Draiv is a local start
up from Banggai Luwuk, which is online
is a start
-
up that provides various services 
related to the Banggai Luw
uk area, such as 
shuttle services for cars, motorbikes, food, 
laundry, and alms services. Based on the 
observations of researchers, the Draiv 
application has good potential to be a

5. CONCLUSION
 
 
The conclusion is that the dominant problem in 
the Banggai area's tourism marketing is the 
limitation of human resources in the tourism 
office, tourism site managers, and tourism 
drivers 
from the communities around the tourism 
environment, impacting tourism management 
operations whole. The marketing analysis that 
has been carried out has used digital marketing 
but has not been properly utilized. The marketing 
strategy aimed at the 
Banggai Brothers area is 
digital collaboration tourism, namely; Planning 
phase using a collaborative market system. 
Establish an agreement to cooperate 
(collaboration) all related tourism stakeholders, 
including the regional tourism office, tour 
managers, 
entrepreneurs around tourist sites, 
and the local community. Implementation Phase, 
The implementation phase includes creative 
infusion, strategic positioning, marketing plan 
development and training, and content marketing 
formation implementation. They wer
e followed by 
the Control Phase, which includes evaluation and 
adjustment. This research is expected to help 
create a collaborative tourism marketing strategy 
4.0 based on the use of the internet, especially 
social media and applications used in the 
Bangga
i area and even tourism throughout 
Indonesia.
