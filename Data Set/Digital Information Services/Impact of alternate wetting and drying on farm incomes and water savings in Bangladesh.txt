  ii  Summary  
In recent years, rice in Bangladesh is increasingly being grown in the dr y (boro) season 
which lasts from January to May. Unlike the rice grown in the monsoon season when 
there is rain, boro rice is mainly produced with ground water irrigation.  
The treatment being studied is a water -management technique for irrigated rice called 
Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD). AWD involves inserting a perforated PVC pipe into the soil to allow the farmer to observe soil moisture below the surface. The AWD guidelines suggest that the farmer let the field dry until the water level reaches 15 c m 
below the surface —  which has a visible marking within the pipe. Once this water level is 
reached, the farmer should re- irrigate the field up to a level that depends on the current 
status of the crop. The process of alternatively wetting and drying the field should be 
practiced until the time that the crop starts to flower or reproduce . The farmer should 
keep suffi cient water in the field during flowering because the crop water requirements 
are much higher during flowering relative to the previous vegetat ive stage of growth. The 
farmer also drains the field approximately one to two weeks before harvest, regardless of 
their chosen method of irrigation. AWD is meant to reduced total irrigation withdraw 
relative to a system where the field is never allowed to  dry, i.e. “continuous flooding”.  
Previous studies suggest that this simple technology saves about 25- 30% of irrigation 
water. AWD has been developed and tested since 2004 but no systematic evaluation was undertaken until now. A precious 3ie funded non- experimental study Meenakshi et 
al. (2012)  in West Bengal found that metering may reduce water use in the dry season 
and also reduce water sales.  
The goal of the project is to evaluate the effect  of AWD relative to conventional flood 
irrigation in rice. Our main question is: what is the impact of AWD adoption on farm 
incomes and water savings? How do these impacts vary across different physical and 
institutional environments such as shallow and deep water tables, pricing regimes for 
irrigation water and communal vs private tube well ownership? What is the farmer’s 
willingness to pay for AWD technology? Because of the positive effect of AWD in 
reducing the depletion of groundwater stocks and lowering methane emissions from rice 
fields, there may be a gap between private and social benefits of the technology, necessitating the use of subsidies for widespread adoption by farmers.  
In Phase 1 we start with 400 villages in Rajshahi, Rangpur and Mymensingh  division of 
Bangladesh, divided into two experimental groups. Ten farmers in the 200 treatment villages were provided with the AWD pipe and instructions on its benefits and training on 
using it to measure soil moisture. The farmers in the remaining 200 vi llages act as a pure 
control. This first phase allows us to estimate the average treatment effect of AWD 
across the whole population of farmers.  
We find that the profitability of the AWD technology depends crucially on whether 
farmers face volumetric prices. AWD has no effect on profits with seasonal water 
charges, consistent with the observation that water management did not change in this 
setting. Volumetric prices, on the other hand, incentivize use o f the technology: we find a 
significant increase in farm profits of about 7%. Overall, this first experiment suggests 
that there may be a fundamental market failure that explains why farmers do not value a iii  water - saving technology with proven results in the laboratory: they face a zero marginal 
price of water . 
In Phase 2, we conducted a RCT to estimate the causal effect of encouraging hourly 
irrigation prices on the valuation of water -saving technology by farmers. In Northwestern 
Bangladesh, there are 4,000 community tube wells that are equipped with meters that can take prepaid debit cards and release irrigation water. Farmers can load their own 
cards with funds at a nearby kiosk and obtain irrigation water on demand. This solution is 
low-cost, implementable and aligns incentives for efficient water use. Our t reatment 
seeks to increase the penetration of prepaid card usage in order to examine the causal link between pricing policy and technology adoption and to test a scalable solution for 
implementing volumetric pricing. 1  
We identified 144 villages which have installed meters, but use of prepaid cards by 
individual farmers is almost non -existent. 2 In order to encourage hourly pricing for water, 
we randomly selected 96 villages for a campaign to assist farmers in obtaining their own 
debit cards. Many farmers at tribute the low rate of individual card ownership to the costs 
associated with the application process. Our treatment sought to reduce these costs by organizing a meeting with farmers to explain the purpose of the prepaid cards, help them fill out the pape r application, obtain the photograph needed, pay the application fee of  
$1.9, deliver the forms to the irrigation authority, pick up the cards once complete, and deliver them to farmers. Once in hand, a farmer can load the card with funds —  the 
same way as  a mobile phone — and purchase water from the village tube well.
 
Encouraging hourly billing in the second RCT causes the demand for AWD to become less price responsive. Demand elasticity falls by 33% from 1.7 to 1.14 when comparing treatment and control vi llages. At the four highest prices, the hourly cards increase 
purchase of AWD by 35%. We find no effect on uptake at the four lowest prices. This demand experiment also lets us estimate the value farmers place on this conservation technology. Consumer surplus — when measured at our median price of $0.7 —  
increases by 64% in prepaid card treatment villages.  
Yet, demand for AWD is low, both among treatment and control farmers. Using a survey with local shop owners, we estimate the marginal cost of production of the pipe to be $1.66 — a price well above the level at which demand falls to zero. Only about 20% of 
the purchasing farmers were found to be using the technology when field staff returned 
to check on usage.  Nonetheless, we estimate that a 1% increase in price decreases 
                                                
1 It is scalable because the policymaker only needs to provide farmers with payment cards and 
install a single meter at each pump, rather than individual meters for each pl ot. 
2 In most  cases  the tube well operator  maintains  a few cards,  manages  the allocation  of water  to 
farmers, and provides them with equal per -acre bills regardless of their individual consumption. 
The bills are most often paid in two installments: at the beginning and at the end of the season. 
One of the main benefits of this approach — from the perspective of the tube well operator — is 
the ease of tracking. The operator only  needs  to observe how much money  is being used  on his 
cards  and acreage  cultivate d by each farmer, rather  than keep track  of the individual  hours  
pumped.  The operator  levies  a markup before calculating the per -acre cost to be charged to each 
farmer. The per -acre charge makes it easier to conceal this markup: the per hour cost of pumping 
is generally known to farmers.  iv  usage by 2.6% in control villages but only by 0.6% for farmers with hourly irrigation 
cards. That is, the price -usage elasticity shows the same pattern as the price- purchase 
elasticity.  
From a policy point of view, we show that if the incentives are aligned correctly, there is a 
demand for the AWD technology. We see higher purchase and usage rates, and water 
savings and a small but significant increase in farm profits. Policy makers should 
consider two options: first, promote the AWD technology in areas where farmers pay 
volumetric pricing. Second, consider mechanisms that can allow a transition from seasonal water prices to paying by volume. This could be done by retrofitting existing tubewells to accept debit cards wherever possible, strea mlining the system for debit card 
application, reducing application costs and creating infrastructure such that these cards 
can be easily recharged, and retrofiting tubewells that work with debit cards.

TOC   Theo ry of Change 1  1. Introduction  
We use two randomized controlled trials in Bangladesh to study a simple water 
conservation technology for rice production called “Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD).” 
Despite proven results in agronomic trials, our first experiment shows that AWD only saves water and increases profits in villages where farmers pay a marginal price for water, but not when they pay fixed seasonal charges. The second RCT randomly 
distributed debit cards that can be used to pay volumetric prices for i rrigation wat er. This 
low-cost, scalable intervention causes farmers to place more value on the water -saving 
technology. Demand for the technology becomes less price- sensitive.  
This study is the first rigorous field experiment that examines the role of pri cing 
mechanisms in agricultural water use, although numerous agronomic studies have been 
done in experiment stations, see, e.g., Zhang et al.  (2012).  It shows that a lack of 
incentives  — creat ed by water pricing —  inhibits technology adoption and use. 
Facilitating access to debit cards for hourly irrigation alters demand and increases the 
value farmers place on water -saving technology. While many economists have 
highlighted the need for water pricing reform as a means to increased conservation, there is little evidence that policy intervention can alter pricing regimes at the local level, especially in developing countries. Our study shows that modest efforts to lower 
application costs and increase farmer access to marginal pricing have significant positive 
effects on the demand for water -conservation technology. These findings have 
implications for numerous countries across the world where fixed prices for agricultural 
water persist while at the  same time water is becoming increasingly scarce.  
In Sections 2 and 3 we discuss the intervention and evaluation questions and methods. In Section 4, we discuss implementation fidelity. In Sections 5 and 6, we discuss in detail 
the procedure and results fo r the two phases of the study conducted. In Section 7 we 
estimate the social benefits of the technology. In Sections 8 and 9 we provide discussion 
and conclusions and recommendations.  
2. Intervention 
2.1 Description  
We are using a combination of a cluster randomi zed control trial with partial equilibrium 
welfare analysis to rigorously measure the impact of AWD. In Phase 1 we start with 400 
villages in Rajshahi, Rangpur and Mymens ingh districts of Bangladesh. These areas  
were chosen to encompass the different water  sources and ways in which farmers pay 
for irrigation water in the country. We elaborate more on this in Section 3.2.  The villages 
were first divided into two experimental groups. Ten farmers in the 200 treatment villages 
were random ly selected who cultivated plots close to the tubewell. They were provided 
with the AWD pipe free of cost. We also provided that same group of farmers with a training on the benefits of the AWD pipe and how to use it to measure soil moisture. The training was conducted as a classroom session simultaneously with all 10 farmers. After 
the training the field staff went to the study plot of each farmer and assisted them 1 -by-1 
with the installation of the pipe. Both the training and installation was adm inistered by 
employees of a local NGO who themselves were trained by IRRI, Bangladesh Agricultural University, and the Department of Agricultural Extension.  2  The farmers in the remaining 200 villages act as a pure c ontrol. This delivers our 
counterfactual f or estimating the average treatment effect of AWD across the whole 
population of farmers.  
For phase 2 of the study, farmers are drawn from a new set of villages distinct from 
phase 1 villages. We chose 144 villages –  96 of them received the treatment in the form 
of access to debit card applications while the rest of the 48 villages served a control. 25 
farmers were selected in each village. All of them received the random AWD price offer 
(i.e. subsidy).  
2.2 Theory of change  
The causal pathway in the theory of c hange is shown in Figure 1.  Focusing on phase I of 
the study, the key input will be the actual AWD pipe. The first intermediate outcome will 
be for the pipe to be installed and used. The TOC divides this outcome into two 
possi bilities. First, we expect installation and take up (where take up refers to actually 
using the pipe) to be higher in areas where incentives are aligned, i.e. in areas where 
farmers pay a marginal price for their irrigation water (the top pathway). Second,  we 
expect take up to be lower in areas where water is not priced volumetrically (the bottom 
pathway). This hypothesis is based on two assumptions that are highlighted in blue: the 
existence of a marginal price for water is a key incentive for adoption and  that there is no 
warm glow effect where farmers are willing to use AWD and save water just for the purposes of helping the environment and saving water for future generations. Notably, the existence of such an effect only works in favor of finding impacts  of AWD on 
intermediate and final outcomes.  
After the AWD pipe is installed and farmers begin to use it, the next step in the causal  
chain is for continued use throughout the season. Farmers will need to use the AWD 
pipe as a soil moisture monitor — meaning they will need to look in it periodically and 
decide when to irrigate. There are again two key assumptions underlying this pathway (in 
blue in the TOC). First, farmers know how to use the AWD pipe. We will address this by 
providing all farmers with simpl e and easy -to-follow guidelines at the time of installation. 
Second, farmers can only use AWD if they can obtain water when they need it.  
All of these things translate into final impacts on crop yield (where we expect no change), 
water use (decrease), methane production from rice (decrease), weeding costs (possibly 
increase) and agricultural profit (unclear). Various studies have reported a de-  crease in 
methane production and potentially higher weeding costs because weeds tend to grow in 
under less flooded conditions, see e.g., Alam et al.  (2009).  
  3  Figure 1: Theory of change 
 
2.3 Monitoring plan 
A baseline survey was conducted for each of the 10 farmers in all the 400 villages from 
the treatment and control groups. This was done mostly in December 2016. This survey 
was designed to elicit demographic information, and important information about 
cropping systems and water payment mechanisms. AWD pipes were installed in early 2017 in plots for the 10 farmers in the 200 treatment villages. Farmers receiving the pipe 
were assisted with the installation and received training on the use of the technology.  
Throughout the rice growing season, we measured the water levels on each study  plot 
twice. These measurements were carried out around dates that were randomly selected. 
These measurements were in the form of the height of the standing water in the plot. 
Pictures were also taken of the plot to corroborate the measurement.  
Methane emi ssions were measured using a closed chamber technique in consultation 
with scientific experts on methane gas chromatography. 104 villages were selected at 
random for this measurement. One plot was randomly drawn from each village. 10 
methane readings were taken for 24 of these plots, and three readings were taken for each of the remaining 80 plots. All were taken on randomly selected days. The total number of observations was 480, where each observation is composed of 3 vials of gas. 
However, a failure of t he gas chromatograph equipment resulted in noisy results for the 
effect of treatment on methane emissions. We do not report those results in this 
document.  
4  Finally, a follow -up survey was done after the boro season for all 4,000 farmers in the 
sample. The goal is to measure profitability of the AWD technology and collect 
information on water use.  
For the phase 2 experiment, i n addition to observing AWD purchasing decisions, and 
tracing out the demand curve with and without the introduction of individual vol umetric 
water pricing, we collected data on whether the pipe was installed and water levels in the 
field. Similar to our first RCT, we randomly drew dates to visit each of the 144 villages. 
These dates were drawn to fall in the 10 -70 day  period after plant ing, when we observed 
farmers from the first experiment practicing AWD. The visits took place during February 2nd - May 23rd 2018, with the median visit occurring on April 1st.  
 During each visit, the enumerator checked all the plots of each farmer to see if an AWD 
pipe was being used. In addition, water levels were measured on the plot closest to the tube well for a random 75% of farmers and the farthest plot for the rest of the sample. 
These additional data allow us to decompose any treatment effects into  effects on initial 
valuation at the time of purchase and actual usage during the season.  
Ensuring high quality for the intervention has been of prime importance. First, the NGO 
which executed much of the intervention and the PIs of this study have a long relationship 
through other similar interventions. Moreover, field staff were selected, trained and 
supervised by a member of our team Muhammad Ashraful Habib, who is employed by IRRI. Each survey was preceded by a full day of training and a full day of field data  
collection with the trainer. For the gas sample experiment,  additional levels of training at 
both the classroom and field levels were imparted by scientists of the Bangladesh 
Agricultural University and the International Fertilizer Development Center . 
3. Evaluation 
3.1 Primary and secondary questions  
The main evaluation questions are as follows:  
1. What is the average impact of AWD on water savings from irrigated rice?  
2. What is AWD’s impact on other input usage, such as herbicide expenditures and 
weeding labor?  
3. What is AWD’s impact on overall profitability from the plot?  
4. Does AWD have external benefits by saving water or reducing methane 
emissions from rice paddies? 
5. How do the farmer’s revealed private benefits (demand curve) compare to both 
the costs of AWD and the estimated external benefits (if any)? 
3.2 Design and Methods  
The experiment is a randomized control trial in 400 villages of Bangladesh. It is a cluster 
randomized design with a village- level treatment. In Phase 1, the villages are split 
equally into tr eatment and control groups. The number of farmers included per village is 
10, making a total sample size of 4000. The average treatment effect (ATE) of AWD was 
identified from a regression of the main outcomes on the village- level treatment indicator 
and s trata fixed effects.  5  The sample for our first RCT consists of 400 villages in Rajshahi, Rangpur, and 
Mymensingh districts of Bangladesh (134 in Rajshahi, 133 in Mymensingh, and 133 in 
Rang pur). The villages have been randomly divided into two experimental groups, with 
stratifi cation at the upazila (subdistrict) level. Figure 2  shows a map of the sample 
villages and their treatment assignment. The farmers in the 200 treatment villages have been provided with the AWD pipe, training on its use, and assistance with its installation. The farmers in the remaining 200 villages serve as a pure control.  
Figure 2: Map of treatment and control villages 
 
Source: https://ga dm.org/maps.html   
The map shows the treatment villages (in blue) and the control villages (in green). The bar chart 
embedded in the map shows the share of households (by division) where the study plot has volumetric water pricing.  
The map also demonstrates what the baseline tells us about an important component of 
our design: the frequency of volumetric water pricing across districts. Farmers in 
Rajshahi largely report paying hourly prices for pumping water and this is far less 
prevalent in the other distr icts of Rangpur and Mymensingh. We repeatedly return to this 
feature of our data in the discussion that follows.  
Figure 3 provides a diagrammatic representation of the experiment, while Figure 4  
shows a timeline of the interventions and surveys. This first phase of the study allows us 
to estimate the ATE’s of AWD across the whole population of farmers. Most importantly, 
we can estimate its impact on crop yield and the environmental benefits that come through reduced water use. Since continuously flooded rice increases CH4 emissions, 
we will quantify the effects of AWD on CH4 emissions —  by measuring CH4 emissions in 
selected treatment and control plots.  All of these effects will be identified from a 
regression of the main outcomes on the village -level treatment indicator and strata fixed 
effects. The estimates will be Intention to Treat (ITT) since we cannot guarantee that any 
farmer will maintain the AWD pipe or practice its proper use.  
6  The ratio  of prepaid irrigation cards to farmers in many villages is less than one. In some 
areas this phenomenon is extreme: the deep driver or water user’s committee in the 
village maintains a small number of prepaid cards, uses them to provide water to 
farmers, and then charges each farmer the same fee per acre. In effect, this local 
institution keeps water pricing on a per -acre basis, despite the fact that technology is in 
place for each farmer to pay for their pumping by the hour. Multiple factors may explain 
why individual card usage, and hence volumetric pricing, has not taken effect in these 
villages: it is costly and time consuming for farmers to obtain an individual card, coordination difficulties — i.e. problems in creating an efficient queueing system if each 
person is individually using a card, and concerns about fairness because some plots are far from the tube well and water is lost during transport due to the earthen canals used for conveyance. Combined with highly fragmented landholdings, this will result in 
differential prices per unit of actual water between farmers and plots as well. Our 
treatment targets the fixed costs of obtaining a card as a barrier to individual ownership.  
We first identified 144 villages in Rajshahi district — not included in the sample of our 
first RCT —  where most farmers were not using their own prepaid card for pumping. 
These villages are spread across three upazilas, two of which were included in our first 
experiment. Field staff worked with a local village leader in Novem ber 2017 to identify  25 
farmers cultivating rice during the boro season in each of these villages. The villages 
were then randomly divided into two groups. 96 were assigned to a treatment group 
where we sought to increase the share of farmers paying for ir rigation by the hour by 
using their own cards: the remaining 48 serve as a control group that retained the status 
quo of seasonal charges.  
Field teams started by organizing a meeting with these 25 farmers. These meetings  took 
place in December 2017 and ser ved four objectives. First, a short baseline questionnaire 
was administered. Second, farmers were instructed on how the irrigation system can be operated with the individual cards. Third, our field staff explained to farmers that their 
local NGO was running a program to help with applying for the prepaid card. Specifically, 
the field staff assisted each farmer in filling out the application form — including obtaining 
a passport -style photo to be printed on the card. Fourth, there is an application fee of 
150 Bangladeshi Taka (around $1.8) to be paid at the time of submitting the application. Farmers were instructed that the program would be covering these costs.  In addition, 
our partner delivered the application forms to the local upazila office of the agency 
responsible for producing the cards, collected the printed cards when they were complete, and delivered them to each treatment village prior to planting. Overall, 2,279 of 
the 2,400 (95%) farmers in the treatment group agreed to receive the cards as par t of the 
program.  
Does this effort to introduce volumetric pricing cause farmers to place greater value on 
the AWD technology? To get at this question, we conducted a revealed- preference 
demand experiment in all 144 villages. A sales person visited each of  the 25 farmers in 
January or early February 2018, depending on the planting dates in the village. S(he) gave each farmer the opportunity to purchase an AWD pipe at a randomly determined village -level price. We let the price range from 20- 90 taka. As point s of reference, the 
daily wage for casual agricultural work during the previous boro season was about 350 
taka. The estimated profit advantage of AWD was about 561 taka per plot — when 
farmers faced nonzero marginal prices for water.  Farmers who bought the  pipe were 7  required to pay cash. The pipe was handed to the farmer, along with instructions on its 
use, immediately after purchase. Unlike in the first RCT, field staff did not provide any 
further training or assistance with actually installing the AWD pipe . 
In addition to observing these purchasing decisions, and tracing out the demand curve with and without the introduction of individual volumetric water pricing, we collected data 
on whether the pipe was installed and water levels in the field. Similar to our first RCT, 
we randomly drew dates to visit each of the 144 villages. These dates were drawn to fall 
in the 10 -70 day period after planting, when we observed farmers from the first 
experiment practicing AWD. During each visit, the enumerator checked al l the plots of 
each farmer to see if an AWD pipe was being used. In addition, water levels were 
measured on the plot closest to the tube well for a random 75% of farmers and the 
farthest plot for the rest of the sample. These additional data allow us to de compose any 
treatment effects into effects on initial valuation at the time of purchase and actual usage 
during the season.  
In Phase 2, the 144 villages selected were all from Rajshahi but not part of the Phase 1 
experiment. In these villages most farmers were not using their own prepaid card for 
pumping. They are spread across three upazilas, two of which were included in our first experiment. Field staff worked with a local village leader in November 2017 to identify 25 
farmers cultivating rice during the  boro season in each of these villages. We worked with 
a village leader to identify farmers — rather than select them randomly — because our 
sample required farmers that were not using their own prepaid irrigation cards. The 
villages were then randomly div ided into two groups using a random number generator in 
Stata. 96 were assigned to a treatment group where we sought to increase the share of 
farmers paying for irrigation by the hour by using their own cards: the remaining 48 serve 
as a control group that  retained the status quo of seasonal charges.  
Field teams started by organizing a meeting with these 25 farmers. These meetings took 
place in December 2017 and served four objectives. First, a short baseline questionnaire 
was administered. Second, farmers were instructed on how the irrigation system can be 
operated with the individual cards. Third, our field staff explained to farmers that their 
local NGO was running a program to help with applying for the prepaid card. Specifically, 
the field staff assisted each farmer in filling out the application form — including obtaining 
a passport -style photo to be printed on the card. Fourth, there is an application fee of 
150 Bangladeshi Taka (around $1.8) to be paid at the time of submitting the application.  
Farme rs were instructed that the program w ould be covering these costs.  In addition, our 
partner delivered the application forms to the local upazila office of the  
agency responsible for producing the cards, collected the printed cards when they were 
complete,  and delivered them to each treatment village prior to planting. Overall, 2,279 of 
the 2,400 (95%) farmers in the treatment group agreed to receive the cards as part of the 
program.  
Our design sought to eliminate the possibility that any f uture behavior could be a func tion 
of the small 150 Taka gift to cover the application cost. Therefore, we provided each of 
the 25 farmers in the control group with 150 Taka of mobile phone credits right after 
administration of the baseline survey.  8  3.3 Ethics  
We did not encounter any ethical issues during the two phases. Farmers voluntarily 
accepted the offer to install an AWD device in their field. No problems were reported by 
the enumerators. Farmers were not required to keep the AWD pipe on their field and 
could dispose of i t as they wish.  In the second phase, farmers again voluntarily chose to 
buy the device at the offered price, and install or dispose of the pipe. The study has  been 
approved by the Institutional Review Board for Social, Behavioral, and Educational 
Research at Tufts University.

3.4 Sampling and data collect ion 
In this section we discuss the sampling and data collection. The survey instruments are 
included in online Appendix B. The 12 upazilas were selected based on local knowledge 
of IRRI Bangladesh researchers. The selection was based on two primary criteri a. First, 
the upazilas had to be in areas where rice is the dominant crop in the boro season. This 
was validated using satellite imagery of boro rice areas from IRRI. Second, the upazilas 
in Rajshahi and Rangpur districts needed to have some area covered by government 
deep tube wells.  
10  Within these upazilas, eligible villages were next identified. Villages in Rajshahi and 
Rangpur were only considered to be eligible if they have deep tube well (DTW) irrigation 
for boro rice. This effectively means that every village in the sample in these two districts 
has a government tube well run by either the Barind Multipurpose Development Authority 
(BMDA) or the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC). We selected 
all villages in Mymensingh based on the census. The 400 villages in the sample were drawn randomly from the set of eligible villages.  
Within each village, enumerators went to a village leader and identified the 10 farmers that were cultivating plots close to the tube well used for irrigation. In t he event that there 
was more than one tube well, enumerators were instructed to focus on the tube well with 
the largest command area. In most cases that tube well services more than 10 farmers. 
Enumerators asked the village leader for the names of the 10 closest farmers. These 
farmers were then asked for consent to participate and in rare cases farmers that did not 
consent were replaced with the next closest farmer. These 10 farmers constitute the 
main sample for measuring the effectiveness of AWD. One limi tation is that we selected 
the farmers closest to the tube well rather than a random sample from the command 
area. It would have otherwise been prohibitively costly to collec t further data on water 
management. Nonetheless, our hypothesis on pricing incenti ves and conservation is 
meant to test a particular behavior that seems generalizable. That is, there is no reason 
to think that farmers further from the tube well would respond to incentives any differently 
than those closer. In addition to identifying the farmers, the enumerators took the GPS 
coordinates of the plots identified by the village leader, which we refer to as the study 
plots. Figure 6  gives an example of the study plots and the location of the tube well for 
one of  the villages. The farmer that manages the study plot is the respondent to our 
surveys when available. If not available, surveys are carried out with an available household member that has knowledge of management for that plot.  
For the second experiment, a similar process was followed to identify the 25 farmers in 
each village. In the 96 treatment villages, 95% of the farmers agreed to obtain the debit card.  
Figure 6: Example of study plots in one village  
 
The map shows an example of the 10 study plots for one of the experimental villages. The green 
shaded areas are the plots while the red dot is the tube well that is used to irrigate those plots.  
11  The experiment required objective measurement of water usage. However, no villages in 
our sample were equipped to measure individual -level pumping volumes. We there - fore 
designed a unique data collection strategy to observe water usage without individual 
meters. Survey teams visited each of the study plots on two randomly chosen and 
unannounced days. These visits enable us to observe whether the field was being dried 
and how much irrigation water stood in it. The random assignment of villages to days 
allows the treatment -control comparison to be made throughout the growing season. 
Having th is ability is critical because the AWD tool should not be used during the 
reproductive stage of crop growth. Hence, visiting fields on random days gives us the 
ability to verify if the tool is being properly used and whether the causal effect of AWD 
varies  by the type of water pricing. The schedule for the measurement of water 
management included 8,000 obser vations. We obtained data for 7,596 of them (95%). 
The missing observations resulted from random measurement dates falling after 
harvesting was complete d.3  
Our teams then carried out a follow -up survey in July 2017 after the boro rice crop had  
been harvested and close to the time of planting for the next rainy season. This survey 
collected information on self -reported irrigation management, input use, c rop yield, revenue, 
and profit. The data provide the basis for our calculations of profitability and treatment effects of the AWD technique on profit — both with and without volumetric pricing.  
We conducted a second RCT to estimate the causal effect of enc ouraging hourly irrigation 
prices on the valuation of water -saving technology by farmers. In Northwestern Bangladesh, 
there are 4,000 community tube wells that are equipped with meters that can take prepaid 
debit cards and release irrigation water. Farmers  can load their own cards with funds at a 
nearby kiosk and obtain irrigation water on demand. This solution is low -cost, implementable 
and aligns incentives for efficient water use. Our treatment seeks to increase the penetration 
of prepaid card usage in order to examine the causal link between pricing policy and 
technology adoption and to test a scalable solution for implementing volumetric pricing.
4  
We identified 144 villages which have installed meters, but use of prepaid cards by individual farmers is almost non -existent.
5 In order to encourage hourly pricing for water, 
we randomly selected 96 villages for a campaign to assist farmers in obtaining their own 
debit cards. Many farmers attribute the low rate of individual card ownership to the costs 
                                                
3 Harvesting dates were estimated from information on planting dates and length of the growing 
cycle from the baseline survey. This is obviously an imperfect proxy for current -year harvesting 
dates and there-  fore explains why the data are missing for a small number of cases. Missing data 
due to this scheduling issue is balanced across treatment and control groups.  
4 It is scalable because the policymaker only needs to provide farmers with payment cards and 
install a single meter at each pump, rather than individual meters for each plot.  
5 In most cases the tube well operator maintains a few cards, manages the allocation of water to 
farmers, and provides them with equal per -acre bills regardless of their individual consumption. 
The bills are most often paid in two installments: at the beginning and end of the season. One of 
the main benefits of this approach — from the perspective of the tube well operator — is the ease 
of tracking. The operator only needs to observe how much money is being used on his cards and 
acreage cultivated by each farmer, rather than keep track of the individual hours pumped. The 
operator levies a markup before calculating the per -acre cost to be charged to each farmer. The 
per-acre charge makes it easi er to conceal this markup: the per hour cost of pumping is generally 
known to farmers.  12  associ ated with the application process. Our treatment sought to reduce these costs by 
organizing a meeting with farmers to explain the purpose of the prepaid cards, help them 
fill out the paper application, obtain the photograph needed, pay the application fee of  
$1.9, deliver the forms to the irrigation authority, pick up the cards once complete, and deliver them to farmers. Once in hand, a farmer can load the card with funds —  the 
same way as a mobile phone — and purchase water from the village tube well.  
This nudge towards hourly water pricing changes how farmers value water -saving 
technology. We estimate the demand curve for AWD by sending sales teams to all 
villages and offering farmers an AWD pipe at a randomly determined village -level price, 
along with inf ormation on its use. The eight different random prices ranged from 15 to 
70% of the marginal cost of the pipe.
 
4. Findings  
4.1 Intervention implementation fidelity  
The original plan was to estimate the demand for the AWD device in Phase 2. In the final phase 3 of  the proposal, we had planned to focus on understanding whether subsidies 
for AWD can be precisely targeted. The plan was to return to the 120 control villages from Phase 1 and offer AWD at subsidized prices to farmers that were not part of Phase 1. In 60 randomly chosen villages we would set a uniform subsidy at a level determined 
by our Phase 2 analysis. These villages would be compared with the other 60 villages 
where we customize the subsidy offer based on the farmer’s elicited discount rate 
(elicited a fter Phase 1 with an incentivized choice experiment). Comparing uptake 
across these villages would be informative of whether subsidies for conserving water are 
more effective when we use simple economic theory to optimally set their levels for 
different fa rmers.  
Since the Phase 1 results suggested that the existence of the marginal price for water was a critical factor that affected the benefits from AWD, in Phase 2, we now conduct the debit card encouragement first, followed by the demand elicitation exper iment in the 
same treament and control villages. This revised experiment in Phase 2 allowed us to estimate the causal effect of debit card possession on the demand for AWD. We believe that this correction was a marked improvement from the original plan.  
During our implementation of the first phase, and interaction with farmers during sev eral 
visits and organized village meetings, it became clear to us that discount rates may have 
little to do with the uptake of the AWD. Other factor s had a larger and more i mmedi ate 
role in affecting the performance of the AWD technology, such as the marginal price of 
water and spillover effects relating to water distribution within the village. Clusters of 
farmers located in close proximity within the command area of the tubewell may receive 
irrigation water at the same time, and adoption decisions may be related to specific 
farmer characteristics such as location of farmers in relation to the  distribution system 
and gradi ent of the field. For example, if a cluster of farms r eceive water during the same 
irrigation  cycle because they are close to each other, a single farmer may not adopt the 
AWD device because his irrigation schedule may now diverge from his neighbors.  
 13  The phase 2 experiment was carried out in new villages and  only in Rajshahi district 
where tubewells are equipped with meters that can accept debit cards. The details of the 
experiment are described elsewhere and not repeated here.  
We made sure that the interventions were consistent across the two experiments. T he 
training given by enumerators was effective –  this is clearly observed from the water use 
shown in Fig 7. Farmers were asked to not use the pipe during flowering, and that is 
exactly what we observe around the 70 day mark. Evidence that the pipes were i nstalled 
was obtained through photographs of the pipe in the farmer’s plot taken when the 
enumerator visited for water measurements. In RCT 2, cards were distributed to farmers and we recorded the names of the farmers with their card numbers. That ensured that 
these farmers received the cards.  
5. Impact Analysis 
5.1 Descriptive statistics and balance tables  
In Table 1, we show the summary statistics for baseline variables. Baseline covariates 
are well balanced across treatment arms. Table 2 shows mean values of baseline char - 
acteristics in addition to p- values from regressions of each characteristic on treatment 
and strata fixed effects. We report balance for the covariates which were previously used to describe the sample. Only one of the 19 characteristics tested is significantly different 
between treatment and control arms at the 10% level.  
Our pre -analysis plan contains several tests of heterogeneous treatment effects as a 
function of whether the wat er price is linked to usage. Most of the variation is across 
upazilas. This combined with our treatment assignment being stratified by upazila helps 
balance the random ization within pricing regimes.  Table 3 verifies this. Foc using on the 
sample with volumetric prices, two of the 18 characteristics are significantly different 
between treatment and control households.  
In combination, the randomization succeeded at generating comparable treatment and 
control groups both for the w hole sample and within the sample where incentives align 
for AWD adoption. Our simple regressions of the main outcomes on treatment and strata fixed effects will therefore generate estimate treatment effects that are internally valid   
for our sample. Our pre -analysis plan also includes regressions that control for these 
baseline characteristics. However, these findings suggest that the estimated effects are 
likely to change little when including these controls.  
Table 3 shows baseline characteristics for the treatment and control groups in the 
second RCT and Table 4 shows covariate balance. Household and farm characteristics 
are generally similar across the two groups. Household size is the only characteristic not 
balanced across treatment and con-  trol villages.
 The average farmer in this sample pays 
around 1500 taka (approximately  $18) to irrigate one bigah of land (a bigah equals one-
third of an acre). 70% pay this money directly to the deep driver as a per -bigah fee. The 
remaining 30% pay the fee to a wat er users committee.   
 
 14  5.2 Effect on water use  
Our pre -analysis plan (online Appendix C) guides the impact analysis. We use the first -
year experiment to estimate the causal impact of AWD technology on water 
management, input costs, and agricultural profits.  
Table 1: Summary statistics of household demographic variables  
 
The table shows mean values and standard deviations of baseline demographic variables for all 
4,000 households in the sample. Column 1 shows statistics for the entire sample, while Columns 
2-4 show separate summary statistics for the three districts. Age and years of education are for 
the survey respondent, which is the decision maker on the study plot if that person was available. 
The baseline was administered to decision maker for the study plot for 78% of respondents.  
  
15  Table 2: Covariate balance across treatment arms  
 
The table shows mean values of each baseline characteristic and standard deviations for control 
(Column 1) and treatment (Column 2) farmers. Column 3 gives the p- value from a regression of 
the characteristic on treatment and strata (upazila) fixed effects, where standard errors are 
clustered at the village level.  
  
16  Table 3: Balance of baseline characteristics for volumetric pricing experiment  
 
The table shows mean values of baseline characteristics for farmers in the 48 control (column 1) 
and 96 prepaid- card treatment villages (column 2). Standard deviations are displayed below each 
mean value in parentheses . Column 3 shows the p- value from the regression of each 
characteristic on the treatment indicator and strata (Upazila) fixed effects. The data are based on the baseline survey carried out with 25 farmers per village during December 2017.  
  
17  Table 4: Covariate balance across treatment arms for sam ple of households with 
volumetric pricing  
 
Data are only for the 1,388 households that report volumetric water pricing at baseline. The table 
shows mean values of each baseline characteristi c and standard deviations for control (Column 
1) and treatment (Column 2) farmers. Column 3 gives the p- value from a regression of the 
characteristic on treatment and strata (upazila) fixed effects, where standard errors are clustered 
at the village level.  
18  Our preferred specification is therefore,  
yivs = β0 +β1Treatmentv +β2Volumetricivs +β3Treatmentv ∗Volumetricivs +αs +εivs, (1) 
where yivs is the observed outcome for farmer i in village v and upazila s. The treat ment 
indicator, Treatmentv , varies only at the village level. The indicator for volumetric pr icing 
varies mostly across upazilas, but can occasionally vary within these strata.6 We 
estimate equation (1) for the sample of 4,000 study plots, regardless of whether the 
farmer kept the AWD pipe in that field, chose to move it elsewhere, or removed it entirely 
— all of which happened rarely. We report both these heterogeneous effects and the 
average treatment effect.  
The average effect of AWD on water management —  across the entire sample —  is both 
small and statistically insignificant. Table 4  shows in column 1 that the average study plot 
in treatment villages had only 0.06 cm less water standing in the field. Increased uptake 
of the AWD practice should increase the likelihood that study plots of treatment farmers are being dried, i.e. have no standing water in the field. Column 2 shows that the treatment increases the effect on drying by about 1.9 percentage points — or about 4% 
— but this average effect is noisy . It is also clear that farmers practice some form of the 
AWD technique without using PVC pipes: fields in the control group were dry 45% of the 
time. Thus, the correct counterfactual for AWD differs from the one used in agronomic 
experiments where water i s maintained in the control field for the entire season.
7  
5.3 Heterogeneity of impacts  
We found significant heterogeneity of impacts between farmers who pay a fixed charge 
for water and those who pay be the volume of water used. As discussed earlier, the 
wate r savings were significant for those who paid volumetric prices.  
Table 4 shows that AWD is only effective for farmers who face volumetric water prices. 
In column 3, AWD generates an effect on water levels only for farmers fac ing nonzero 
marginal prices. Introducing AWD in places with volumetric pricing lowers the amount of 
observed irrigation water by 0.43 centimeters, or an 18% decrease. The probability of a 
plot being dry also increases by 8.4 percentage points (19%). Finall y, the third row of the 
table shows that the correlation between volumetric pricing and water use (within strata) 
is small and statistically insignificant. This result could be driven by either the limited 
variation within strata, or correlation between unobservables and volumetric pricing.8 
                                                
6 Upazila fixed effects explain 77% of the variation in the indicator variable for volumetric pricing. 
The remaining variation within upazilas is largely due to three factors: 1) some villages in 
Mymensingh have a system where the tube well owner collects payment for the fuel used in 
pumping, while other nearby villages do not, 2) a few villages in Rajshahi did not have the prepaid card system for irrigation and 3) the tube well owner (who always faces a nonzero marginal price) may be part of the sample in Mymensingh villages.  
7 Agronomic experiments generally compare AWD to “continuous flooding.” This is a system 
where the farmer never lets the field go dry. The field is re -irrigated when water reaches a low 
level, but before evaporating entirely.  
8 The volumetric pricing indicator has a negative correlation with water levels and a positive 
correlation with the probability of fields being dried when dropping strata fixed effects and 
therefore using variation across upazilas.  19  Table 5: Effects of AWD treatment on water usage 
 
The data are from random unannounced visits to the study plots of sample farmers during the 
2017 boro (dry) growi ng season. The dependent variable in columns 1 and 3 is the amount of 
standing water in the field, measured in centimeters. The dependent variable in columns 2 and 4 is an indicator variable for a dry field with no standing water. Volumetric pricing is an indicator for 
farmers for whom the water price is tied to usage, either through hourly charges or fuel payments. 
Standard errors are clustered at the village level. Asterisks indicate that coefficient is statistically 
significant at the 1% 
∗∗∗, 5% ∗∗, and 10% ∗ levels.  
Combining these findings, Figure 7 demonstrates how the effectiveness of AWD varied 
both across time and by type of water pricing. It shows nonparametric regressions of water 
levels (top panel) and the indicator for dry fields (middle panel) on days after planting, 
separately for treatment and control villages. The upper left panel shows that AWD caused 
a decrease in irrigation withdrawals during the pre -flowering period of crop growth — but 
only for farmers paying for water on the margin. The same estimates in the upper right 
panel establish that AWD had no impact on measured water levels for farmers facing seasonal charges. The middle panel shows a similar pattern with dry fields: we observe that introducing AWD leads to a noticeable increas e in drying in places with vol umetric 
pricing during the early part of the growing season, but no changes are observed for the two thirds of farmers that pay for water on a seasonal basis. The figure also helps  
visualize how farmers conserve water when facing volumetric prices, even without AWD.
 
Namely, farmers tend to keep fields dry after flowering, regardless of whether they are using AWD pipes.  
Table 5 shows the exact magnitude of these impacts. Under volumetric pricing, AWD 
causes water levels to be lower by 0.83 cm (31%) and leads to a 17.3 percentage point 
increase in the occurrence of dry fields (54%) during the first 70 days of the growing 
season. In contrast, the effect of  AWD during this time is close to zero and statistically 
insignificant for farmers facing seasonal contracts. Columns 3 and 4 verify the visual 
results that plots of treatment farmers were managed in the same fashion as those of the 
control group after the  first 70 days of the growing season, regardless of the type of 
water contract. These results are insensitive to the choice of splitting the sample using a 
threshold of 70 days: we show in Tables 6  and 7 that results are similar when we divide 
the season using a 60 or 80 day cutoff.  
20  Table 6: Heterogeneous effects by first 70 days of the growing season 
 
The data are from random unannounced visits to the study plots of sample farmers during the 
2017 boro (dry) growing season. Columns 1 and 2 are for measurements taken up to 70 days 
after transplanting.  
Columns 3 and 4 are for measurements taken more than 70 days after transplanting. The 
dependent variable in columns 1 and 3 is the amount of standing water in the field, measured in 
centimeters. The dependent variable in columns 2 and 4 is an indicator variable for a dry field with no standing water.  
Volumetric pricing is an indicator for farmers for whom the water price is tied to usage, either through hourly charges or payments for diesel fuel. Standard errors are clustered at the village level. Asterisks indicate that coefficient is statistically significant at the 1% 
∗∗∗, 5% ∗∗, and 10% ∗ levels.  
Our estimates line up with f indings from agronomic trials only when prices are set 
volumetrically. Figure 8  shows 87 impact estimates reported in 26 different agronomic 
studies. The estimated water savings from these experiments range from 5 to 65%, wit h 
median savings of 27%. Our 19.2% effect on water levels when prices are volumetric — 
from Table 4 column 3 — falls right at the 25th percentile of the agronomic estimates.    
In contrast, the null effect with area -based pri cing is outside the range of estimates from 
agronomic trials. The failure of markets to efficiently price water appears to be a critical 
factor causing the field- based RCT estimates to deviate from those in the laboratory.  
Our post -harvest follow up survey  included a module on irrigation management. Using 
these data, column 1 in Table 8  shows that farmers given AWD report 3.6 fewer 
irrigations, which amounts to a 19% impact since the average plot in the control group 
was irrig ated about 19 times, or once every 5- 6 days. Yet, all treatment farmers report 
irrigating their fields less, regardless of whether their village has volumet ric pricing 
(column 2). Experi menter demand effects offer a reasonable explanation for this finding:  
treatment farmers knew that practicing AWD reduces the number of irrigations and 
responded accordingly  — even if they did not practice AWD as recommended. Turning 
to columns 3 and 4, treatment farmers report 2.2 additional drainages, which 
corresponds to a 91% increase relative to the control group. This effect is significantly 
larger for farmers in villages with volumetric pricing, as shown in column 4.

5.4 Effect on costs and profits  
Adoption of AWD only increases profit when water is priced at the margin.9 Column 1 in 
Table 9 shows that the causal effect of AWD on profits per acre, in the absence of 
volumetric pricing, is close to zero and statistically insignificant. In contrast, the AWD 
technology increases profits by approximately 1,870 taka (about $23) per acre, or about 
7%, when water has a marginal price. Columns 2- 4 decompose the effect, showing that 
the overall effect on profitability comes from lower water costs and higher revenues,  not 
increases in yield.10 Columns 5- 8 report similar results when all outcomes are measured 
in logs rather than levels. In Tables 10  and 11 we provide a breakdown of the effect of 
the treatment on material and labor expenditures.  
Overall, AWD leads to positive returns only when water is priced at the margin. This 
conclusion is robust to trimming outliers in the profit distribution, controlling for a broad 
                                                
9 We measure revenue per acre by dividing the total output from the plot by plot size to obtain 
yield, regardless of how much of the output was sold or kept for consumption.  We then multiply 
the yield by   the output price for the 98.5% of farmers that reported selling output. We use the 
average sale price for the remaining 1.5% of farmers that did not sell any output. We collected input expenditures for fertilizer, pesticide, herbicide, water, planting labor, weeding labor, and 
harvesting labor. Labor inputs included both family labor and hired labor. We valued family labor 
by multiplying the number of person days by the daily wage rate from the survey.  
10 The fact that AWD leaves yield unchanged is cons istent with agronomic experiments (Belder et 
al., 2004;  Yao et al.,  2012).  The positive — although insignificant — effect on revenue is therefore 
driven by higher prices. AWD leading to higher output prices is consistent with a claim sometimes 
made that periodic drying of fields improves grain quality.  
24  set of bas eline covariates, and interacting those covariates with treatment. Consistent 
with the survey estimates, we also find no difference in satellite- measured greenness 
between treatment and control plots. Despite using less water, the plots of treatment 
farmer s appear no less green. We also find evidence that treatment effects on adoption 
and water usage persist for another year after the experiment.11  
Finally, we find that within Rajshahi district — where prepaid pumps allow water to be 
priced by the hour —  some farmers do not have their own prepaid cards.12 Instead, 
farmers rely on the deep driver (tubewell operator) to use his card and then charge them 
a fixed seasonal price. This charge is a function only of acreage cultivated, and not the number of hours of pumping. The deep driver essentially averages out the total pumping 
cost over the entire command area and bills farmers accordingly. This local institution 
provides additional heterogeneity. In particular, the profits from AW D should be higher 
for farmers that hold their own cards and thus stand to gain by pumping less 
groundwater. We test this idea in the study villages in Rajshahi.
13 
Column 1 of Table 12  shows that  AWD lowers water costs by about 931 taka —  or 17% 
— for cardholders and has no effect for farmers that pay the deep driver for water. The 
effect on profits and log profits in columns 2 and 3 is noisier, but goes in the same direction. AWD increases profit  by 11 to 12% for farmers with cards, but it has a smaller 
effect in villages where individual card ownership is absent. The system where farmers hold their own prepaid cards and pay for water by the hour is however not randomly 
assigned.
14 The observed het erogeneity could therefore result from factors correlated 
with card ownership, rather than card ownership itself. Columns 4 through 6 test whether 
the interaction effects are sensitive to interacting the AWD treatment indicator with a 
large set of baseline characteristics. The interaction effects between the AWD treatment 
and having an individual prepaid card remain similar —  and actually increase —  when 
allowing for the impact of AWD to also depend on observable characteristics. The evidence further points  to inefficient water pricing as a barrier to AWD uptake.  
                                                
11 We consider the persiste nce of treatment effects over time by using a subsample of villages 
where we elicit demand in the same way as in the second RCT, described later in the paper.  In 
particular, farmers in 112 randomly selected treatment villages and 56 randomly selected cont rol 
villages were offered an AWD pipe for the 2018 season at one of eight random prices. These 
offers took place in both treatment and control villages, but Table ?? shows that initial treatment 
farmers were still 70% more likely to be using AWD — on any plot — during the 2018 season. 
Using water measurements from one of those plots, treatment plots had 17% less water and were 
39% more likely to be dry. Measurements were taken on the plot closest to the village tube well 
for a random 75% of farmers and the farthest plot for the remaining 25%. We see that the 
treatment effect on second- year adoption is larger amongst farmers with volumetric prices, but the 
interaction term is imprecisely estimated. We do not find heterogeneity in this “first -stage” 
relationsh ip for the specific plot where enumerators measured water levels.  
12 Our baseline survey, and hence the analysis until this point, classified these farmers as paying 
volumet ric prices because their village already had a prepaid pump installed.  
13 We did not know about this heterogeneity at the time of designing the study. Therefore, these 
estimates were not pre- specified in our analysis plan.  
14 Farmers who have their own cards are older, have larger households, own more livestock, are 
less likely to own their  own private tube well, and report irrigating their field more often during the 
boro season at baseline.  25  Table 9: Effects on self -reported water use

The data are from the follow up survey and are limited to the Rajshahi district where some 
farmers have their own prepaid irrigation card to pay for water by the hour. The variable “Has 
Card” is an indicator variable for farmers that report having their own prepaid card. The dependent variables are the cost of water per acre (columns 1 and 4), profit per acre (columns 2 and 5), and log prof it per acre (columns 3 and 6). Columns 4- 6 include demeaned farmer 
covariates from baseline and interactions between these demeaned covariates and the AWD 
treatment indicator. The covariates included are all of those in Table?? (age, years of education, 
household size, number of livestock owned, landholdings, television ownership, refrigerator 
ownership, tube well ownership, indicator for knowledge of AWD, indicator for a rented or 
sharecropped plot, plot area, number of crops grown, indicator for growing t wo rice crops, number 
of boro irrigations, revenue per acre in boro, boro total cost per acre, and aman revenue per acre). Asterisks indicate that coefficient is statistically significant at the 1%

levels.  
5.5 Effect on demand for AWD  
Our findings until this point suggest that lack of a marginal price for water creates a dis - 
incentive for the adoption of water -conserving technology. But the findings from the first 
RCT do not allow us to firmly rule out that unobservables correlated with the existence of 
nonzero marginal prices drive the heterogeneous impact of AWD. With this limitation in 
mind, we designed the phase 2 experiment to randomly facilitate volumetric pricing and 
measure its effect on demand for AWD. This section discusses the timing of events and 
results for the debit card experiment.  
We now show some descriptive “first stage” evidence that some farmers did use the 
prepaid cards. The experiment was carried out in three upazilas, one of which provided us complete data on card usage for the 800 treatment farmers. We found that 40.3% of 
them (323) loaded their card at least once during the period from January 12th to August 
7th, 2018. The median farmer — conditional on loading at least once —  spent 3,000 taka 
($37.5 or the equivalent of irrigating about 2 plots with seasonal charges) and loaded the 
card five times. These distributions have a substantial right tail: a farmer at the 90th 
percentile reloaded the card 22 times and  spent 21,800 taka (Figure 9). 28  Figure 9: Densities of number recharges and amount spent for farmers using 
prepaid cards  
 
Notes: The figure is for farmers in the one upazila (Paba) that provided us wi th usage data on the 
prepaid cards. Both graphs are for the 323 farmers that used the card. The left panel shows the 
density of the number of times the card was recharged, while the right figure shows the density of 
the total amount spent (in taka).  
Does t he demand curve for AWD change when farmers are encouraged to pay for water 
by the hour of pumping? To answer this question, we combine the random variation in 
village -level AWD prices with the random encouragement of prepaid card usage. The 
main specifica tion is,  
Adoptionivs = β0 + β1Cardvs + β2P ricevs + β3Cardvs ∗ P ricevs + αs + εivs,  (2) 
where Adoptionivs is an indicator for whether farmer i purchased the AWD pipe, Cardvs 
equals one if village v in upazila s is one of the 96 prepaid card villages, and P ricevs is 
the random AWD price offered in the village. As in our previous analysis, standard errors 
continue to be clustered at the village level.  
Figure 10 shows the fitted demand estimates from (2) as lines with t he raw adoption rates 
as dots. Shifting farmers to hourly charges reduces price sensitivity for AWD. Our lower 
prices result in high take up rates and no statistical difference between the prepaid card 
treatment and control. About 65% of farmers in the control group purchased pipes at the lowest four prices: this rate remains roughly the same in treatment villages. In contrast, 
introducing hourly irrigation cards caused AWD demand to increase at higher prices. Only 
21% of farmers in the control group purchased pipes when priced at 60 taka or higher. Hourly pricing increased purchases by approximately 35% at these four higher prices.  
The take- up rate of the device depends on the randomized price offered in the village and 
whether farmers were treatment or con trol. As shown in Figure 10  , the share of farmers 
purchasing the device was ranged from 60- 80% at lower prices and about 20% at the highest 
prices offered. The take- up was significantly higher at higher prices for treatment farmers.  
Two additional results are apparent in Figure 10.  First, demand is elastic. The demand 
elasticity in the control group is about 1.7 at the midpoint price of 55 taka. Delta-  method 
standard errors lead to a rejection of unit elastic demand in the control. This result is 
consistent with the common finding that demand  for improved technology in developing 
29  countries is highly price sensitive — even for technologies proven beneficial. As 
examples, experimental estimates of  demand show high sensitivity to prices for health 
technologies in Kenya (Kremer and Miguel,  2007;  Dupas,  2014b)  and crop insurance in 
Ghana (Karlan et al.,  2014).  This demand elasticity suggests that even modest subsidies 
have the potential to induce large increases in the demand for AWD.  
Figure 10: Demand curve by volumetric pricing treatment  
 
Notes: Figure shows linear demand estimates for farmers in the 144 villages that were part of the 
second- year experiment. The blue dots are raw adoption rates for the 96 treatment villages where 
prepaid hourly irrigation cards were provided. The blue line is the linear demand estimate for 
treatment villages.  
The grey dots are adoption rates in the 48 control villages and the grey line presents the corresponding linear demand estimate. Asterisks denote that the marginal impact of the treatment (from the linear demand estimates) is statistically significant (1% 
∗∗∗ , 5% ∗∗, and 10% ∗). The 
estimation sample includes all 25 farmers in each village.  
Second, willingness to pay for AWD is low when compared to both the profitability of the 
technology and the estimated marginal production cost. In the first experiment, AWD with 
volumetric pricing increases profits by about 1,870 taka per acre. The median plot in our 
first-year sample is 0.3 acres, implying that using an AWD pipe on a single plot increases 
profits by about 561 taka — a value well above what farmers are wi lling to pay. We 
estimate the marginal cost of AWD production to be 133 taka — based on surveys 
conducted with 10 engineering shops.15 Our findings show no demand at this price, even 
after promoting hourly pricing for water. However, the socially optimal pr ice of AWD 
depends on its external benefits. These may include reduced greenhouse gas emissions from electricity, reduced methane emissions from rice fields, and the social benefit of the 
groundwater not extracted and available to others, discussed later i n this report.  
Table 14 shows the corresponding regression results. Column 1 gives the average 
treatment effect across all price levels. The irrigation card treatment led to an increase in 
the AWD purchasing rate by about 4.3 percentage points, or roughly 10%. The aver - age 
effect is indistinguishable from zero due to the significant heterogeneity across price 
                                                
15 Field staff visited each shop in June 2018 and asked the owner for a quote to produce two 
different ran-  domly selected quantities of AWD pipes. Regr essing the estimated quotes on 
quantity delivers a coefficient of 133 taka.  
30  levels. Column 2 provides the main estimates corresponding to the specification in (2). 
Demand for water -saving technology is less responsive to price in villages where we 
introduce hourly irrigation cards. Increasing the price by 1 taka leads to a 1.29 
percentage point decrease in adoption without volumetric pricing. This price 
responsiveness falls significantly by 0.34 percentage points when we facilitate volumetric 
pricing. The demand elasticity at a price of 55 taka — reported at the bottom of column 2 
— falls by 33% from  1.7 to 1.14 with the prepaid card treatment. This difference in 
elasticities is statistically significant at the 1% level.16 We also pre- specified a functional 
form wher e prices are measured in logs. Columns 3 and 4 show that this additional 
specification gives similar results. Overall, introducing a pricing mechanism that  puts a 
marginal price on water increases farmers willingness to pay for water -conserving 
technology.  
The estimated demand curves can be used to calculate the gain in consumer surplus that results from encouraging volumetric prices.  Figure 11 shows the percentage in-  crease in 
consumer surplus between farmers with and without hourly irrigation cards. For instance, 
when priced at 55 taka — the median price in our demand experiment — nudging farmers 
to adopt volumetric pricing c auses consumer surplus  from AWD to increase by almost 
64%. These gains in consumer surplus are largest at higher prices, as seen in Figure 10.

technology
 
 
The data are from the 144 villages that were part of the second- year experiment. The sample consists 
of 25 farmers per village. The dependent variable in all regressions is an indicator if the farmer 
purchased the AWD pipe at the randomly set price. Prices were set randomly at the village level and range from 20 to 90 taka (around $0.24 to $1.1). The volumetric treatment variable is an indicator for 
villages where the 25 farmers were provided assistance with filling out the a pplication for a prepaid 
(hourly) irrigation card and a waiver of the 150 taka sign- up fee. The p- value for equal elasticities is 
based on standard errors from the delta method. Standard errors are clustered at the village level. 
Asterisks indicate that coefficient is statistically significant at the 1%

16 We rely on delta- method standard errors for this statistical test since the elasticities (and their 
difference) are a non- linear function of the parameter estimates.  
31  Figure 11: Effect of volumetric pricing treatment on consumer surplus from AWD  
 
Notes: The figure shows the gain in consumer surplus (of AWD) from the prepaid card treatment 
(measured in %) as black dots.  The black dots are the percentage difference between the two 
surpluses at various prices p . The 90% confidence intervals (whiskers) are estimated from 1,000 
bootstrapped samples where the range of each whisker shows the 5th to 95th percentiles of the 
distribution of percentage changes in consumer surplus.  
The intervention in our first experiment included assistance with installing the AWD pipe. 
Providing farmers with the AWD tool, some basic training, and installation sup-  port led 
to reduced water use and increased profitability for farmers paying for water by the hour. 
The large gap between purchasing and using AWD in the second experiment highlights the importance of basic training and installation support to ensure that the full benefits of 
AWD are realized.
17 
Figure 12 shows that despite the low rate of installation, the unconditional price- usage 
relationship remains steeper in prepaid- card villages. The dashed lines in the figure 
show usage (installation), while the solid lines show the demand curves (purchasing).  
The number of treatment farmers buying AWD pipes ranges from about 260 at a price of 
20 taka to a round 70 at a price of 90 taka.  The average num ber of users across all the 9 
price points is around 25. At prices above 60 taka, only 1.4% of farmers installed AWD in 
control villages. Approximately 7.4% did so in treatment villages. The regression 
estimates in Table 16 provide exact magnitudes. In column 1, increasing price by one 
taka (about 1.8% of the midpoint price of 55 taka) causes a decrease in the usage rate 
by 0.16 percentage points, or 2.3% of the mean usage rate amongst control villages. 
Column 2 again shows the heterogeneity in price responsiveness. A one taka price 
increase causes a decrease in adoption by 0.33 percentage points in control villages and 0.10 percentage points in treatment villages. While the interaction term is not quite statisti cally significant (p=0.135), the point estimate shows that around two thirds of the 
price responsiveness in control villages is eliminated when introducing hourly pricing. 
                                                
17 We also measured water levels on a single plot per farmer. Table 15 shows that the interaction 
between price and the volumetric treatment does not have a positive coefficient for these specific 
plots. This lack of a “first -stage” relat ionship may explain why we do not observe any effect on 
water management on these plots.  
32  The estimated elasticities at the bottom of the table make this clear. The price- usage 
elasticity in control villages  is 2.58 and this falls by over 75% to 0.6 in treatment vi llages. 
The difference between the two elasticities is highly significant. Columns 3- 4 
demonstrate that similar result s are obtained with log prices.  
The difference in elasticities appears to result from how the prepaid cards change the 
screening ability of prices. Among farmers who purchased an AWD pipe, the correlation 
between price and usage is significantly larger in prepaid card villages. In fact, the price-
usage  correlation is negative in control villages and weakly positive in pre-  paid card 
villages. Screening offers one potential explanation. The prepaid cards put a marginal price on water. Realizing this, farmers carefully evaluate the merits of the AWD pipe.  The 
farmers induced to buy the AWD pipe at higher prices are those that value them most 
and are the ones most likely to install. In contrast, prices for conservation technol ogy do 
not screen effectively in the absence of volumetric water pricing because f armers stand 
to gain little from using the pipe for irrigation.  
Table 15: Relationship between the prepaid card treat ment and observed water 
management on one field per farmer   
 
The data are from the 144 villages that were part of the second- year experiment. The sample 
consists of 25 farmers per village. The data are for one plot per farmer. The chosen plot is the 
closest to the village tube well for 75% of random farmers and the furthest plot for the remaining 
25% of farmers. Prices were set randomly at the village level and range from 20 to 90 taka 
(around $0.24 to $1.1). The volumetric treatment variable is an indicator for villages where the 25 
farmers were provided assistance with filling out the application for a prepaid (hourl y) irrigation 
card and a waiver of the 150 taka sign- up fee. Standard errors are clustered at the village level. 
Asterisks indicate that coefficient is statistically significant at the 1% ∗∗∗, 5% ∗∗, and 10% ∗ 
levels.

Notes: The figure shows the demand curves for AWD as solid lines, where uptake is measured as 
purchasing the pipe from the door -to-door salesperson. The solid lines merely replicate the 
demand c urves from Figure 10.  The dashed lines instead consider usage, where usage is defined 
as an enumerator being able to verify that an AWD pipe was installed in one of the farmer’s fields. 
The blue lines are for farmers in the 96 treatment villages where prepaid hourly irrigation cards 
were provided. The grey lines are for the 48 control villages. Asterisks denote a statistically 
significant treatment effect of the hourly irrigation cards (1% ∗∗∗, 5% ∗∗, and 10% ∗). The sample 
in each village is the 25 farmers that were identified at the start of the experiment.

The data are from the 144 villages that were part of the second- year experiment. The sample 
consists of 25 farmers per village. The dependent variable in all regressions is an indicator equal to one if it was verified that the farmer installed AWD on one of their plots. Prices were set 
randomly at the village le vel and range from 20 to 90 taka (around $0.24 to $1.1). The volumetric 
treatment variable is an indicator for villages where the 25 farmers were provided assistance with 
filling out the application for a prepaid (hourly) irrigation card and a waiver of th e 150 taka sign- up 
fee. Standard errors are clustered at the village level. The p- value for equal elasticities is based 
on standard errors from the delta method. Asterisks indicate that coefficient is statistically 
significant at the 1% 
∗∗∗, 5% ∗∗, and 10% ∗ levels.  
34  6. Estimating the benefits of the technology  
We also try to briefly consider the environmental benefits of AWD. First, AWD reduces 
groundwater extraction which lowers electricity demand and therefore greenhouse gas 
emissions from  electricity generation. Ideally, electricity should be priced at its marginal 
social cost, which would include the negative externalities from electricity generation. However, taxing electricity has proven to be elusive in practice. In the absence of a 
socially optimal electricity price, subsidizing energy efficiency is a second -best 
alternative to reducing these externalities.  
We quantify one part of such a subsidy for AWD by approximating the dollar value of 
reduced carbon emissions from an installed AWD  device. We base our estimate on both 
the results from the experiment and additional data we collected for this purpose. The 
remainder of the section describes the different steps of this computation.  
Reduced groundwater pumping: We do not have survey meas ures of pumping hours 
to compare treatment and control farmers from our first experiment. However, col - umn 1 
in Table 12  finds that AWD reduces water costs by 931.1 taka per acre for farmers with 
hourly irrigation cards. The median plot size is 0.3 acres and the cost per hour of 
pumping is 120 taka. Combining these three figures delivers an estimated savings of 2.3 hours of pumping per AWD device.  
Electricity consumption per hour of pumping: We sent enumerators to 26 random 
villages in March/April 2018 to observe electricity usage by monitoring electric meters 
during tube well operation. We use the starting and ending time of operation, combined 
with electricity consumption, to estimate an electricity usage of 18.1 kilowatt hours (kwh) per hour of operation. As a benchmark, annual household electricity consumption per 
capita in Bangladesh is about 300 kwh.  
Electricity produced per unit of consumption: The ratio of electricity produced to  
consumed in Bangladesh is 1.14. We adjus t this number to allow for 75% of the trans - 
mission losses to be attributed to electricity flowing through power lines, while the other 
25% are fixed and independent of consumption. We therefore end up with 1.105 kwh of 
production needed per kwh of consum ption.  
Marginal CO
2 emissions from electricity production in Bangladesh : A reduction in 
electricity demand for irrigation reduces CO 2 emissions from generating electricity. 
Marginal CO 2 emissions from electricity depend on a number of factors, including the 
type of fuel and the efficiency of power plants. Ideally, we need data from Bangladesh 
power plants with repeated observations on plant load and emissions. Without this data 
for Bangladesh, we instead use annual panel data from about 3,900 U.S. power plants to 
estimate marginal CO 2 emissions as a function of fuel type and thermal efficiency of the 
plant. We then obtain these two characteristics (fuel type and efficiency) for the universe 
of Bangladesh power plants and estimate marginal emissions per plant  using the 
regres sion estimates from U.S. plants. We take the average of plant -level marginal 
emissions where each plant is weighted by its share of annual electricity generation for 
the whole country.  
This approach delivers a marginal emissions rate of 1. 4 lbs of CO 2 per kwh of electricity. 
This number is roughly on par with CO 2 emissions generated by the electricity grid in the 35  eastern United States. The estimate is also similar to the grid emission factor released 
by the Bangladesh Department of Environm ent in 2014 (1.47 lbs per kwh).  
Social cost of carbon: We use the standard estimate of 31 US$ per ton of CO 2. 
Combining these figures, the estimated one- year benefit of AWD on a single rice plot  — 
due to reduced carbon emissions from electricity — is 79.91 taka. This annual benefit 
represents about 60% of the marginal cost of production. Moreover, these are not the 
only external benefits of AWD. Agronomic studies find that adopting AWD lowers 
methane emissions  from rice by approximately 50% . We attempted to measure 
methane gas on a sample of 104 plots from the first experiment. A malfunction in our 
partner’s gas chromatograph delayed analysis of the samples and made these results 
unreliable.  
An additional social benefit of AWD is in valuing the groundwater t hat is not pumped, and 
remains in the aquifer for future use, which delivers benefits to other farmers relying on 
the same groundwater source. To approximate these benefits, we first need to compute 
the volume of water saved by AWD. The calculations above suggest that AWD reduces pumping times by 2.3 hours per plot. The standard government deep tube well has a 
capacity of 1 cusec, i.e. 1 ft 3/sec or 101.941 m 3/hr. Thus, a reasonable estimate of 
averted pumping by using AWD on a single plot is 234.46 m 3 or 0. 19 acre feet of water. 
Column 3 of Table 4  shows water savings of about 18.3%, suggesting total water use of 
1.04 acre feet for the rice plots in our sample. A conservative agronomic estimate of the 
return flow for rice is 25 %. That is, 25% of the averted pumping caused by AWD is water 
that would have returned to the aquifer anyway. Thus, an estimate of the true water 
savings from AWD is 75% of the averted pumping, or 0.1425 acre-ft. This volume of 
water is not trivial. It represents about half of the mean annual household residential 
consumption in the United States.  
What is the value of this conserved groundwater? The average value of water in rice 
farming in our sample can be obtained by multiplying the profit per acre from column 1 of 
Table 9 (which is 27,133 taka) by plot size (0.3 acres) and dividing by total water use 
(1.04 acre -ft) which gives 7,827 taka per acre- ft of water. This is approximately $93 per 
acre- ft, which is high for a developing country, but shows the value of water for dry - 
season rice in Bangladesh. Our estimate of the value of conserved water from using 
AWD on a single plot is therefore 1,115 taka per year ($13.9). The estimated benefits 
from water conservation are an orde r of magnitude greater than the benefits from 
reduced CO
2 emissions.  
In summary, the technology we study can del iver substantial environmental benefits.  
However, farmers valuing the technology, and using it properly, depends on water having a marginal pric e. 
7. Discussion  
7.1 Introduction 
In our first experiment, we offer rigorous evidence on the causal effect of AWD on water 
savings, profits and input costs. The average effect of AWD on these outcome variables 
was small and insignificant. We observed no significant difference between treatment 36  and control plots in the frequency of dry fields or in the level of water in the field. Our 
results show that a sizable number of farmers dry their fields even without AWD. Thus 
continuously irrigating the rice plot may not be the correct counterfactual for evaluating 
AWD.  
However, we find that AWD has significant effects only in plots where farmers pay 
volumetric pricing. There is a 18% decrease in the height of the observed water in the 
field and a 19% decrease in the probability of the field being dry. These water savings 
occur in the first 70 days after planting. Our magnitude estimates under volumetric pricing fall at the 25% of existing estimates from laboratory evaluations of AWD. However, the failure to price water see ms to explain the divergence between our 
estimates from the field and those from the laboratory. Most lab experiments are unable 
to incorporate behavioral elements in their analysis.  
A limitation of the first RCT was that volumetric pricing may be correlat ed with un-  
observables that affect the heterogeneous impacts of AWD use. Thus in the second 
experiment, we observe that demand for AWD is elastic, with an elasticity of 1.7 at the 
midpoint of prices offered. Similar observations have been made in the heal th and 
development literature: revealed willingness to pay for water purification in Ghana is 
orders of magnitude below the estimated benefits to households (Berry, Fischer, and 
Guiteras,  2018).  Moreover, the willingness to pay for the technology was low, compared 
to the estimated benefits of installing an AWD pipe on a typiocal plot, which is about 533 
taka. Our estimate of the marginal cost of production for the pipe is 133 taka, but at this 
price, demand is close to zero.  
There are several limitations of our study. We do not experiment with the level of the 
hourly irrigation price. Instead, we encourage a switch from a seasonal contract to hourly 
billing, where the hourly price is set uniformly  by the local irrigation authority. Our 
treatment only approximates volumetric pricing because hours pumped is imperfectly 
cor- related with the volume of water extracted. Given that electricity accounts for a large 
share of the pumping cost, our treatment  moves the pricing regime towards marginal 
cost pricing. But we do not necessarily introduce the socially optimal hourly price 
because that price would need to incorporate the externality costs  of electricity 
generation. Im plementing volumetric pricing is difficult due to its high cost and political 
pressure from farmers, some of whom may lose under the new regime (Tsur and Dinar,  
1997).  How- ever, our study shows that a simple digital payment technology moves the 
pricing regime closer to marginal cost pricing and induces farmers to put more value on conservation technology. In essence, encouraging volumetric pricing leads to a 
perceptible change in the farmer’s attitude towards conservation, as  measured by the 
shift in their demand for the technology.  
We also do not measure water use on farmer plots perfectly. We observe whether the field is dry and measure the depth of the water level during randomized visits. These 
measurement can introduce er ror in our estimates.  
However, there is no field evidence that documents the role seasonal water charges play 
in discouraging efficient agriculture water use (see Zilberman and Schoengold (2005)).  
To our knowledge, this is the first paper that randomly introduces volumetric pricing for 
agricultural water. Fishman et al.  (2016)  use non- experimental variation to study the 37  water savings from a program in India where farmers voluntarily installed meters and 
were compensated for electricity savings relative to baseline consumption. They find no 
effect of the program on groundwater pumping.  
7.2 Policy and program relevance: evidence uptake and use  
In the several workshops we organized, there was intense discussion on the importance of water conservation and specifically AWD in water management. Policy makers and 
scientists involved in AWD research and extension in Bangladesh accepted our t entative 
findings and have promised to discuss follow -up in coordination with other agencies.  
In the larger literature in development and environmental economics, our study shows that inefficient factor pricing may explain why technologies that are available, proven in the laboratory, and seemingly in reach of farmers continue to exhibit low rates of 
adoption. Earlier explanations have focused on failures in output markets (Ashraf, Gine´ , 
and Karlan, 2009),  behavioral biases (Duflo, Kremer, and Robinson,  2011),  frictions in 
insurance or credit markets (Karlan et al., 2014; Cole, Gine´, and Vicker y, 2017), 
unobservable input quality (Bold et al.,  2017),  heterogeneity in the  net benefits and costs 
of adoption (Sur i, 2011),  and learning frictions (Conley and Udr y, 2010;  Hanna, 
Mullainathan, and Schwartzstein,  2014;  Beaman et al.,  2015).
18 We add to this debate by 
showing that the pricing mechanism fo r a critical factor of production inhibits technology 
adoption.19  
7.3 Challenges and lessons 
A key challenge of the study was in understanding why farmers do not use the AWD 
technology, even after purchasing them. While take up is reasonably high, when 
measured by purchasing an AWD pipe, installation and use of the pipe is modest. Only 
18.4% of pur chasing farmers installed the AWD pipes on one of their rice plots.20 
Anecdotally, there are numerous explanations for not installing AWD. Farmers sometimes report hav ing lost the pipe between the time of purchase and planting. Some 
farmers reported that they would install the pipe “in a few days.”
21 After conferring with 
                                                
18 Jack (2011),  de Janvry, Sadoulet, and Suri  (2017),  and Magruder  (2018)  provide 
comprehensive re-  views of the literature on technology adoption in developing country 
agriculture.  
19 Outside of agricultural technology, inefficiently low (marginal) prices for electricity have been 
shown to reduce development and adoption of energy -efficiency technologies in developed 
countries. Borenstein and Bushnell  (2018)  find that electricity is priced below its social marginal 
cost in many parts of the United States. At the same time, a literature on induced innovation 
shows a positive association between electricity prices and development of energy -efficie ncy 
technologies (Newell, Jaffe, and Stavins,  1999;  Popp,  2002).  Other studies find that consumers 
shift to fuel -efficient vehic les when gasoline prices are high (Busse,  Knittel, and Zettelmeyer,  
2013;  Allcott and Wozny,  2014).  
20 A low rate of usage, conditional on purchasing, has been observed for fertilizer trees in Zambia  
(Jack et al.,  2015)  and improved latrines in Cambodia (Ben Yishay et al.,  2017).  The literature on 
technology adoption of health products, on the other hand, has generally found larger rates of 
follow -through (Dupas,  2014a).  
21 Farmers that purchased pipes were told that AWD should be practiced starting 10 days after 
transplanting. The date of the verification survey was randomized and survey teams arrived less 
than 10 days after planting in fewer than 1% of cases. Moreover, the rate of uptake (conditional 38  others, some farmers suggested that it was not feasible to use AWD individually because 
of coordinat ion externalities. Two examples were common. Farmers with low -lying land 
often get water that spills over into their plot when it is being pumped into a nearby 
higher field. Also, a common per -acre water price makes it easy for the tube well 
operator to ir rigate multiple fields at a time. Adoption of AWD by a subset of the farmers 
becomes less practical when each farmer does not have full control over when their field 
is irrigated.  
8. Conclusions and recommendations  
We can draw the following conclusions and of fer these recommendations:  
1. Policy maker, global, national, local: The results obtained from AWD in 
experiment stations can only be replicated in the field if farmers pay a marginal 
price for water. When farmers pay a fixed price that is unrelated to the volume of water they use, the water savings from AWD are statistically insignificant. Across the whole country, water and electricity savings from even modest adoption of the 
technology would be significant.  
2. Policy maker, national, local: In villages which are equipped with tube wells that 
can accept debit cards, facilitating the debit card application process for individual farmers results in a shift in the demand for AWD. More farmers purchased the 
AWD device, especially at the higher prices. However, even after purchase, 
installation of the pipe was low. Most farmers did not install the pipe, suggesting 
that other factors may affect their ability to reduce water use.  
3. Policy maker and Researcher, global, national, local: Our findings suggest that the social benefits of AWD are large, mainly in the form of savings of electricity for pumping as well as the value of the water that can be used later. The benefits 
are an order of magnitude higher than the cost of producing the pipe.  
4. Policy maker, Researcher, global, national, local: One key challenge may be to 
engage in reform of water pricing policies so that farmers face the correct incentives. While changing pricing mechanisms at the local level may be a 
daunting task, some farmers are likely to lose under the t ransition and therefore 
resist change. Our second experiment shows that at least in villages where the 
infrastructure for digital payment exists, increasing the penetration of the digital 
payment system can significantly alter water conservation behavior among 
farmers. In areas where this infrastructure does not exist currently, it may be 
worthwhile to think of policies that encourage new tubewells to come equipped 
with a meter than can accept individual debit cards.  
  
                                                
on purchasing) is only 20% for the farmers that were visited more than 50 days after 
transplanting. Therefore, procrastination, combined with our surveys being early in the season, 
cannot fully explain the low rate of installation.  39  Online appendix es

  In recent years, rice is increasing being 
planted in the dry season mainly due to 
the availability of tubewell irrigation. While 
the use of such techniques leads to an 
increase in food production and self-
sufficiency, it also depletes ground water 
levels in many rice-producing regions. To 
address this issue, researchers at the 
International Rice Research Institute have 
developed the alternate wetting and 
drying technique that can be used to save 
water, further contributing to environment 
conservation. This impact evaluation 
focuses on the effect of this technique, as 
compared to the conventional way of 
flood irrigation, on water savings and farm 
incomes in Bangladesh. This study would 
be useful to policymakers who are keen to 
explore if wider adoption of this technique 
would be beneficial.
