ABSTRACT  
Despite a rapidly growing enthusiasm around applications of information and communications 
technologies (ICTs) to smallholder agriculture in developing countries, there are still many 
questions on the effectiveness of ICT -based approaches. This study assesses the effects of video -
mediated agricultural extension service provision on farmers’ knowledge and adoption of 
improved agricultural technologies and practices in Ethiopia. The study focuses on a program 
piloted by the Government of Ethiopia  and Digital Green and  poses three questions . First, t o 
what extent does video- mediated extension lead to increased uptake of improved agricultural 
technologies and practices by smallholder farmers ? Second, i s video- mediated extension targeted 
at both spouses of the household more effective than when only targeted at the (typically male)  
household head? Third, how cost -effective is a video -mediated approach to extension provision?  
The study explores these questions with a rand omized controlled trial designed  to evaluate the 
video- mediated approach as applied to three priority crops (teff, wheat, maize)  and three 
technologies (row planting, precise seeding rates , and urea dressing) . The trial was implemented 
in 347 kebeles  (village clusters)  during the 2017 meher  (rainy) season  in Ethiopia’s four most 
agriculturally important regional states . Analysis of data from our surveys of 2,422 households  
and 896 extension agents indicates that the video- mediated approach  is more effective than the 
conventional approach  in achieving several key outcomes . Specifically, we find that video -
mediated extension reaches  a wider audience than the conventional approach and le ads to higher 
level s of agricultural knowledge and uptake of technologies in those kebele s randomly assigned 
to the program. While our results do point to greater participation and greater knowledge of 
female spouses  in kebeles  where both  male and female spouses were targeted by the program, we 
do not find clear evidence that the more inclusive approach translated into higher uptake of the 
subject technologies and practices . Finally, we find that the video- mediated approach becomes  
less costly as the scale of operation increases.

 1. INTRODUCTION 
Despite a rapidly expanding body of analytical insight  on applications of information and 
communications technologies (ICTs) to smallholder agriculture in developing countries, there  
are still many questions about  the effectiveness of novel ICT-based  approaches (Nakasone and 
Torero, 2016; Aker, 2011) . This is particularly the case with ICT-mediated agricultural extension 
and advisory services that aim to improve the ways in which farmers manage crops, livestock, 
and natural resources. While several prior studies have explored the impact of simple, low -cost 
text and voice messaging services provided to farmers via mobile  phones , more sophisticated  
approaches have received  far less attention . These include the use of videos to convey 
information to farmers  using intermedia ries such as community organizers , lead farmers,  or 
extension agents , and intermediation tools such as portable projectors and tablet computers . 
 The video medium of fers several advantages over traditional information dissemination 
approaches used by extension agents  and other intermediaries . First, video can be tailored and 
customized to localized information needs via the strategic use of languages, actors, music, 
settings, and other variables that may appeal directly to the viewing audience. Studies in both 
economic s and psycholog y suggest  that information targeted to an individual’s specific needs is 
more effective than broader messaging, and that videos featuring role models similar to viewers 
across multiple dimensions of character or identity reinforce persuasiveness  (see Bernard et al.  
(2015)  for a review). Second, video can allow for consistent content delivery, thereby reducing 
errors in conveying  sensitive  detailed information such as crop timings, input quantities, or other 
variables that require more accuracy than an extension agen t may be able to retain and 
communicate correctly. Third, videos can be produced at a relatively low fixed cost, which 
increases the approach’s cost effectiveness as the number of viewers increases. Thus, whether 
used alone or in tandem with conventional e xtension approaches , video can be a powerful 
medium.  
 The present study seeks to complement this evidence by assessing the effect of video -
mediated extension on farmers’ agricultural practices in Ethiopia. We use Digital Green’s 2 
 scaling -up efforts with the Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture (MoA)1 and regional bureaus of 
agriculture to generate insight s into the impact of the video- mediated extension approach  relative 
to the conventional extension approach, with a randomized controlled trial (RCT) impleme nted 
in 347 kebeles2 during the 2017 meher  (rainy) season. The trial was conducted in four regional 
states of Ethiopia that together account for most of the country’s agricultural production. 
 The study aims to contribute evidence in support  of ongoing reforms within  Ethiopia’s 
extension system —reforms that have been pursued as both small experiments and large 
programmatic changes during the past three decades (Davis et al., 2010). A pillar of these 
reforms has been the large increase in the number of agricultural extension agents (Development 
Agents (DAs) ) deployed to advise farmers : over the past 10 -15 years, a pproximately 90,000 DAs 
have been trained and 18,000 Farmer Training Centers (FTCs) constructed to support these 
efforts . This investment  reflects the Government of Ethiopia’s effort to accelerate agricultural 
growth , a commitment set forth under the broad umbrella of Ethiopia’s Growth Transformation 
Plan (GTP), the country’s guiding strategy for economic growth and poverty reduction.  
 Our results show clear evidence that , relative to the conventional  approach,  Digital 
Green’s video -mediated extension approach led to increases in extension’s reach  and greater 
knowledge among farmers about several improved agricultural technologies and practi ces that 
feature prominently in MoA’s extension program  and those of the regional bureaus of 
agriculture . Specifically, we find that video- mediated extension reached a wider audience than 
the standard extension approach, likely due to increased interest by  farmers in the medium. In 
turn, we find a higher level of knowledge —greater technical understanding of the focal 
agricultural technologies and practices —among farmers in those kebeles selected for video -
mediated extension.  
 Our results also show clear evidence that the video -mediate d extension approach led to 
increases in the uptake of improved agricultural technologies and practices by farmers. 
Following government priorities, we focus on three main crops (teff, wheat, and maize) and three 
technologies  (row planting, precise seeding rates , and urea side  and top dressing). For each crop, 
                                                           
1 During the past 20 years, the official name of the Ministry of Agriculture has changed to include 
mention of mandated topics such as rural development, natural resources, and livestock resources. At the 
time this paper was prepared, the official name  had reverted to the Ministry of Agriculture.  
2 Kebele is the smallest administrative unit in the country, typically covering 10 to 25 villages.   3 
 we find that video- mediated extension led to a 3 to 10 percentage point increases in uptake of 
key technologies. Compared to control group levels, these increases repres ent up to a 35 percent  
increase in uptake of a given technology for a given crop.  
 While our results also  point to greater participation and greater agricultural knowledge of 
spouses who also received the video- mediated extension , we do not find clear evidence that 
targeting both spouses translated into higher uptake of technologies. We also find no immediate 
evidence of video -mediated extension on higher -order outcomes such as crop yields, output, or 
area under cultivation, although these will be the subject of further analysis as additional data are 
collected.  
 The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 pro vides background and 
context for this study  and presents the main research question, focusing on the potential effect of 
video- mediated extension provision based on prior studies and the links between gender and 
extension services. Section 3 presents the experimental set -up of the study: the interventions, 
experimental design, sampling, timing, experimental integrity, and empirical strategy. Section 4 
presents estimates of the intervention’s main impacts, followed by a discussion of the cost -
effectiveness analysis in  Section 5. Section 6 examines the policy implications  of these findings, 
avenues for future research, and concluding thoughts . 
2. BACKGROUND 
ICTs, extension, and developing- country agriculture  
Our study contributes to the emerging literature on the role of ICT s in developing -country 
agriculture, specifically where it intersects with the wider literature on the role of human capital, 
learning externalities, and information delivery in agricultural development (e.g., Foster and 
Rosenzweig, 1995; Hanna et al., 2014). To date, most studies in this subset of the literature have 
focused on evaluating simple, low -cost text and voice  messaging services provided to farmers 
over mobile networks, and more often for price -related information (see Nakasone and Torero 
(2016) and Aker (2011) for reviews). Fewer studies examine the role of ICTs in the provision of 
production- related informati on and advice. Exceptions include the use of short message services 
containing information on crop management advice and weather forecasts in India (Fafchamps 
and Minten, 2012), integrated pest management practices in Ecuador (Larochelle et al., 2017), 
agronomic advice in India (Cole and Fernando, 2014) and advice on timing of sugarcane farm 4 
 operations in Kenya (Casaburi, et al., 2014); animated videos on post -harvest management in 
Burkina Faso (Maredia et al., 2017) and insecticidal neem use in Benin (Bell o-Bravo et al., 
2018); and interactive crop advisory services via mobile phones in India (Fu and Akter, 2012). 
Results from these studies vary from no effects of the ICT -based approach on production and 
yields (Fafchamps and Minten, 2012) to significant changes in input and technology use (Cole 
and Fernando, 2014).  
To the best of our knowledge, only two studies have sought to measure the relative 
effectiveness of using videos to promote agricultural technologies and practices with any degree 
of rigor. Both were conducted in partnership with Digital Green, a non -governmental 
organization specialized in video -mediated extension approaches. In 2007, a small -scale trial 
conducted in India found that combining a training -and-visit extension approach w ith Digital 
Green’s approach to be ten times more cost -effective in promoting farmers’ adoption of 
technologies compared to the sole reliance on the training -and-visit extension approach (Gandhi 
et al. 2007). This was followed by a large -scale randomized c ontrolled trial covering 420 villages 
in the Indian state of Bihar to assess the effectiveness of the Digital Green approach in promoting 
System of Rice Intensification (SRI) practices among smallholder farmers. Findings indicate that 
the probability of adoption increased by 5 percentage points  for those who viewed Digital Green 
videos, which is a 50 percent increase over the 10 percent adoption rate observed in the control 
group (Vasilaky et al., 2015).  
Our study extends this work by presenting new evidence on the use of localized videos to 
convey information to farmers, to augment extension services, and to effect changes in crop 
management decisions —a combined topic of study that has received relatively little attention in 
this growing literature. In doing so, it shifts the focus of inquiry from India, where a broad range 
of ICT applications to smallholder agriculture have received considerable attention, to Ethiopia, 
where mobile phone penetration and internet connectivity ranks among the lowest in Afric a, but 
where the public extension system has a large footprint across the country.  
Ethiopia’s extension system  
Ethiopia’s extension system —one of the largest  in Africa  today —has seen its reach and methods 
evolve considerably during the past four decades (Bachewe et al., 2017; Berhane et al., 2018; 
CSA, 2017; Davis et al. , 2010) . The system currently employs over 70,000 extension agents, 5 
 with approximately 43 development agents (DAs) per 10,000 farmers, and hosts more than 
15,000 farmers training centers (F TCs) that serve as a focal point for agricultural development 
activities at the local level, and 25 Agricultural Technical Vocational Education and Training 
(ATVET) institutes that prepare and update extension staff in both general and specialized fields 
of expertise (Berhane et al. , 2018; ATA , 2014; Davis et al., 2010).  
Agricultural extension services in Ethiopia were formally introduced in 1953/54 with just 
two extension agents attached to the newly established Imperial Ethiopian College of Agriculture 
and Mechanical Arts, now known as Haramaya University (Gebremedhin et al., 2006; Kassa, 
2002). It was not until the socialist regime (1974- 1991) that the mandate, role, and scale of 
Ethiopia’s extension service broadened significantly (Kassa, 2002). Table 1  summarizes the 
scale, reach, and approaches used during Ethiopia’s modern history.  
In the mid -1980s , Ethiopia’s extension system adopted the training- and-visit approach 
that focused on trainin g and using  “contact” farmers to reach other farmers with the community 
(Kassa, 2002).3 By the mid -1990s , this approach had evolved into the Participatory 
Demonstration and Training Extension System (PADETES) approach, which expanded the role 
of local demonstration trials on new technologies and practices, and  led to an increase in the 
number and reach of DAs and the construction of farmer training centers at the kebele level 
(Kelemework and Kassa,  2006; Kassa , 2002, 2003). By about 2010, the extension system 
transitioned to a Participatory Extension System (PES) approach, highlighted by the organization 
of farmers in local development groups and “one -to-five” syndicates to promote localized 
information sharing and peer learning effects.   
Yet it is often difficult to draw a robust causal link between an extension system’s size 
and approach, on the one hand, and outcomes such as technology adoption, productivity growth, 
or poverty reduction, on the other hand. Prior studies on Ethiopia suggests a somewhat 
ambiguous link between the extension system’s size and approach, on the one hand, and 
outcomes such as technology adoption, productivity growth, or poverty reduction, on the other 
hand (Dercon et al., 2009; Nisrane et al., 2011; Spielman et al., 2011; Krishnan and Patnam, 
2014; Abay et al., 2018). Specifically, studies of Ethiopia’s extension system tend to suggest 
                                                           
3 See Feder et al. for a critical review of the origins and evolution of the training -and-visit (T&V) 
extensio n system.  6 
 only a weak relationship between the technical support provided by DAs to farmers and 
productivity growth: yield effects are more likely a function of extension’s role in supplying 
physical inputs such as inorganic fertilizers and improved cultivars than improving farmers’ 
awareness, understanding, and ability to innovate and adapt with better farming practices, 
mark eting tactics, and risk management strategies (Berhane et al., 2018; Dercon et al., 2009). 
While these findings may seem surprising given the scale and reach of Ethiopia’s extension 
system, a deeper analysis of the system suggests that this is entirely pla usible given the 
organizational culture, daily practices, technical and functional skills, and professional incentives 
facing Ethiopia’s extension (Leta et al. , 2017; Davis et al., 2010; Gebremedhin et al., 2006; 
Kassa , 2002).  
In fact, d espite changes in t he extension approaches and methods described above, the 
actual role of DAs seems not to have changed substantially  in Ethiopia . DAs have been 
continuously involved not only in providing advice and training to farmers, but also in estimating 
seed and ferti lizer requirements, estimating crop production, and in other responsibilities less 
directly associated with extension service provision (Kassa, 2003). Berhane et al. (2018) 
indicates that only about 35- 50 percent of DAs’ work time was spent on training and advising 
farmers, while the remainder of their time was spent on activities such as supplying inputs, 
managing loan repayments, collecting taxes, mobilizing communities, and supervising road 
construction.  
In fact, the official title  given to extension ag ents—“development” agents —suggests a 
wider mandate and role for DAs beyond the provision of extension services to farmers, even 
though DAs are placed under the administration of regional bureaus of agriculture and are 
trained under curricula developed by t he MoA. But irrespective of their title and role, there 
seems to be keen interest in strengthening their skills and professionalizing their service 
throughout Ethiopia.  And this is where ICTs enter the picture.  7

 Video- mediated extension  
In an effort to give DAs new tools that might hasten a  shift to a more effective knowledge -driven 
extension system, Digital Green and the Government of Ethiopia pilot ed a video -mediated 
approach to extension in 2014. The approach aim ed to increase the growth rate of  yields and 
output for major food staples by encouraging farmer s to adopt productivity -enhancing 
agricultural technologies and practices. It was expected  to both augment and accelerate the 
adoption process at a relatively low cost per farmer by integrating  locally produced content in 
local languages and featuring local actors with Ethiopia’s existing extension infrastructure . An 
early assessment of Digital Gr een’s approach in Ethiopia based on monitoring data from the pilot 
phase suggests considerable potential in the approach—particularly in its ability to provide 
localized content and reach women farmers  (Bernard et al., 2016) .  
Based on the strengths of res ults from the pilot phase, Digital Green is currently scaling 
up its operations in Ethiopia to 68 woredas  (districts) . This scaling -up effort provides an 
opportunity to provide rigorous insights and evidence on the effectiveness of Digital Green’s  
video- mediated extension approach .  
There are two independent reasons that make the use of localized video content effective 
(Bernard et al., 2016). The first reason is relatively straightforward: locally produced content can 
be tailored to the specific information needs of local individuals and communities. Several 
studies demonstrate the importance of locally relevant information, drawing attention to evidence 
from studies in the economics on education (Jensen, 2012), entrepreneurship (Jensen, 2010) and 
agriculture (Hanna et al., 2014). Psychologists similarly find a positive relationship between 
locally relevant information and public health (Bull et al., 1999; Marcus et al., 1998), weight 
gains (Campbell et al., 1994), smoking habits (Prochaska et al., 1993; Shiffman et al., 2000), and 
education (Kim and Keller, 2008).  
The second reason relates to the idea that persuasion —the ability of an intervention to 
change behaviors toward some desired outcome —depends on the way messages are framed so 
that individ uals can relate to it. In particular, people tend to receive, accept, and internalize 
messages better from those whom they recognize as similar to them. S ocial psychologists 
suggest that attitudes and behaviors are strongly affected by the experience of ot hers in one’s 
immediate environment (Bandura, 1977, 1986). With video content, exposure to role models 9 
 with whom a viewer identifies can substitute for an individual’s experience or the experience of 
actual peers and may be a particularly powerful way of f raming a message to promote attitude 
and behavior change.  
For example, Chong and La Ferrara (2009) and Jensen and Oster (2009) show that 
exposure to TV soap operas featuring strong women and smaller families led to reduced fertility 
and increased women’s autonomy in Brazil and India, respectively. Other studies rely on videos 
purposefully designed to convey specific messages on issues such as financial literacy (Berg and 
Zia, 2013), or HIV prevention (Banerjee et al., 2018).  Others rely on videos with more 
aspirational messages.  In Ethiopia, Bernard et al. (2014) show that screening short 
documentaries featuring rural individuals who affected their life outcomes through perseverance 
and hard work led to significant changes in viewers perception and future -oriented behavior. In 
Uganda, Riley (2017) shows that screening an inspirational movie among secondary school 
students that contained a locally relevant theme and strong role model significantly improved 
educational attainmen t. 
Overall, the literature from both economic s and psycholog y suggest both information 
targeted to an individual’s specific needs is more effective than broader messaging . Both 
literatures further suggest that videos featuring role models similar to viewer s across multiple 
dimensions of character or identity reinforce persuasiveness. These insights provide fertile 
ground for applications of the video medium to agricultural extension and advisory services.   
Gender and extension  
These insights also open the door to consideration of the gender dimensions of extension and 
advisory services. The specialization of labor along gender lines  in agricultural households  is 
often used to justify targeting the dissemination of certain technologies to men (e.g., producti on 
technologies  for cereal crops ) and others to women (e.g. nutrition and health- related 
technologies). This implicitly assumes that, for a given technology, the spouse of the targeted 
individual is not involved in the adoption decision or does not contribute labor to the 
implementation of the technology.  
However,  there is plenty of evidence to suggest that few technologies and practices can 
be reduced and assigned as “male” or “female” for a given household. T here is  also ample 
evidence suggest ing that ad option of many technologies, whether related to agriculture or 10 
 nutrition, is more an  outcome of intra -household decision- making process es (e.g. Udry, 1996; 
Doss and Morris, 2001; Hoel et al., 2017). Such processes are, in turn, influenced by the extent 
to which spouses have access to similar information. Thus, targeting information to one spouse 
may contribute to lower -than-optimal adoption rates if the non- targeted spouse does not have the 
same level of information.  
Yet despite their participation in provi ding labor and other inputs to production, and 
despite their influence on household decision- making processes, women often lack access to 
extension  services in many developing countries . In a study on the adoption of improved maize 
technologies in Ghana, D oss and Morris (2001) find that women are less likely to adopt 
technologies, and that their low adoption rates are correlated with a lack of access to 
complementary inputs and information. In particular, they find that women receive more than 
four times fe wer visits by extension agents than their male counterparts, although the authors 
recognize that this may be related to women having less access to land to start with. In eastern 
Democratic Republic of Congo, Lambrecht et al. (2016) study the relative impa ct of male versus 
female targeting of extension services on the adoption of improved legume varieties, row 
planting, and mineral fertilizer by farm households. Examining  the correlation between adoption 
and the gender of the recipient of extension services , they find that that joint male and female 
program participation leads to the highest adoption rates in male -headed households, and that 
women’s participation in extension is particularly conducive to adoption of labor -intensive 
technologies.  
At this sta ge however, the literature on the potential impact of increasing women’s access 
to extension services remains weak. In a recent paper, Doss (2015) revisits the argument that the 
social rates of return on investments in agricultural development are higher w hen those 
investments are targeted to women. Reviewing prior empirical studies , Doss (2015) finds only 
meager evidence to support these claims, not the least because none of the supporting studies 
rely on convincing identification strategies in their empir ical specifications, in turn implying that 
the results are best interpreted as correlations but not causal relationships. Instead, she suggests 
that research should focus on identifying where the best returns to investments are found by 
relying on gender disaggregation as useful analytical categories since farming and food 
preparation are deeply gendered activities. Some evidence points to the importance of women 
not only as recipients but also as messengers of agricultural information—a policy experiment in 11 
 Mozambique by Kondylis et al (2016) finds that women’s awareness and adoption of 
technologies is higher when the messenger of the information was female.  
In Ethiopia, because women play an important role in agriculture, there is considerable scope 
to study  the interaction between extension  agents  and women farmers . Women —not just women 
who head their own households but also women who are part of male -headed households —are 
potentially central to the adoption of new technologies and practices. Palacios -Lopez et al. 
(2015) estimate that women contribute 29 percent  of the agricultural labor force in Ethiopia: 26 
percen t for land preparation, 26 percent for planting and weeding- related activities, and 37 
percent for land preparation. Several recent studies have documented the effect of targeting 
agricultural extension to women on input use, technology adoption, productivity, and incomes, 
though often as a secondary topic of inquiry (see Ragasa et al. (2013) for a review). Yet 
numerous studies also point out that Ethiopian women have had historically limited access to 
extension services  (Mogues et al., 2009; Ragasa et al., 2013; Buchy and Basaznew, 2017).  
3. STUDY SETTING, DESIGN, AND DATA 
Our study explores t hree broad research questions . First, to what extent does video- mediated 
extension lead to increased farmer uptake of improved agricultural technologies and practices by 
smallholder farmers? Second, is agricultural extension targeted at both spouses of the household 
more effective than when targeted at the (typically male) household head only? Third, how cost -
effective is a video -mediated approach to extension provision?  
We explore these questions in the context of Digital Green’s rollout of the video-
mediated extension approach in 68 woredas located in Ethiopia’s four most agriculturally 
important regional states ( Amhara;  Oromia ; Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples 
(SNNP); and Tigray ) during the 2017 meher  (rainy) season that begins in May/ June and 
continues t hrough harvest beginning in November . The rollout was conducted in close 
collaboration with the MoA, the bureaus of agriculture in each regional state, and local extension 
staff at both the woreda and kebele levels. In this section, we describe the intervention as well as 
our experimental design, sampling strategy, timeline, and experimental integrity.  12 
 The intervention:  video- mediated extension  
To assess the effect of video -mediated extension  provision, we  compare how farmers respond to 
the same information on selected technologies and practices that is disseminated through two 
different approaches: the conventional extension approach and a video- mediated approach. T he 
video- mediated approach is  comprise d of three interlinked components : producing localized 
video content, screening videos in DA -facilitated group sessions , and verif ying the uptake of the 
selected technologies and practices in the field . We describe each of these components in detail.  
Video  production:  The cornerstone of Digital Green’s approach is the production of 
localized video content. Digital Green works with partners —subject matter specialists  from the 
woreda extension office, DAs from a nearby kebele, local civil society organizations, and model 
farmers —to produce short videos  on selected technologies and practices. The videos  all featur e 
farmers from the locality speaking in local languages and  are filmed on a farm . Each video is 10-
15 minutes long and designed to address a specific aspect of the technology, often at a specifi c 
time in the crop calendar, for example, land preparation, seeding and basal fertilizer application, 
and weed management. The information contained in these videos are typically those 
recommended by the MoA and the regional bureaus of agriculture and  are often products of 
research conducted by the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research and regional agricultural 
research institutes.   
Video screening. Videos are screened by local DAs assigned to the kebele using USB -
charged PICO projectors. Video s are screened to members of kebele development groups , which  
are semi -formal administrative structure s within each kebele that comprise s 25-30 farm 
households and are designed to provide community members with a grassroots forum to discuss  
local developmen t issues.  DAs assigned to a given kebele have access to these development 
groups  as part of their day -to-day work , and screen videos with one or several groups in a 
manner designed to facilitate effective learning and discussion. Specifically, DAs screen t he 
videos several times during the meeting, and pause the videos at certain intervals to entertain 
questions or provide additional details. DAs augment their facilitation with input from model 
farmers belonging to the development group(s). In each video, e mphasis is placed on conveying 
what Digital Green describes as the “non -negotiable” elements of the technology package that 
must be adopted to achieve success. These screening sessions are conducted several times during 
the season , each time with new conte nt that is synchronized with the crop calendar. In control 13 
 kebeles  where no video screening is conducted, DAs provide information to farmers through a 
combination of approaches, including individual farm visits, development group meetings, 
community gatherings, and FTC trainings, all of which are conducted directly or through model 
farmers, depending on the modality.  
Adoption monitoring, and verification . DAs and Digital Green staff  conduct follow -ups 
with fa rmers to verify t heir adoption of technologies and practices presented in  the videos , either 
by querying farmers directly or by verifying adoption visually. This follow -up feeds into Digital 
Green’s connect online -connect offline (COCO) system for project monitoring, evaluation, and 
learni ng (Bernard et al., 2016).     
Subject technologies and practices.  The three technologies and practices promoted 
through the video -mediated extension approach in this intervention have been t opics of 
considerable research in Ethiopia.  
Row planting —planting in row with spacing between plants and rows —is a 
recommended agronomic practice to ensure proper light interception, which is among the main 
factors that determine crop growth (Charles -Edwards, 1982). It also facilitates better weed 
management and ensure  even distribution of seeds and thereby uniform access for plan inputs 
like water and nutrients (Fufa et al., 2011). R ow planting has been shown to increase the number 
of plant tillers, number of kernels  per spikes, and seed weight whic h contributes to increase in 
yields under research station trials  (Berhe et al. , 2011; Fufa et al., 2011; Lafond, 1994) . 
However, recent farmer level experimental evidence on row planting for teff and wheat suggest 
much lower impact ( Vandercasteel en et al ., 2018; Abate et al. , 2018) . For maize, row planting 
has been promoted in Ethiopia for several decades and is a more established practice. Despite 
this, broadcasting seeds is not an uncommon practice among Ethiopia’s maize farmers.  
More precise seeding rates have been shown to increase yield by ensuring even 
distribution of seed and thereby reducing the competition between plants for water, light, and 
nutrients (Fufa et al. , 2011. Reducing seed rate also allow for optimal trilling and increase the 
number of kernels per spike  (Carr et al., 2003) . More precise seeding rates are often associated 
with row planting: for teff and wheat, row planting requires lower seeding rates, while for maize 
it may actually require a higher seeding rate depending on how the f armer otherwise broadcasts 14 
 maize seed. However, lower seeding rates for teff and wheat is also recommended for those 
farmers that broadcast plant.  
Urea top or side dressing is another recommended practice associated with the strategy of 
multiple nitrogen a pplication s, i.e. , splitting nitrogen application to make efficient use of 
nitrogen fertilizer when it is difficult to precisely assess the mineral nitrogen content of the soil 
and predict the nitrogen requirement of the crop ex ante  (Spiertz and De Vos, 1983; Baligar and 
Bennett, 1986). Top dressing  or foliar  urea fertilization, in particular, is promoted because it 
reduces potential nitrogen losses and has the ability to provide  nitrogen when root activities are 
impaired , for instance, under  dry conditions  (Gooding and Davies, 1992). While row planting 
and more precise seeding rates are relatively novel practices for many Ethiopian teff and wheat 
farmers, they are more commonly practiced —though not universally —by Ethiopian maize 
farmer.  
Sever al of these technologies have figured prominently in past efforts to accelerate 
productivity growth in cereal staples by the extension system, and by organizations such as 
Sasakawa Global  2000, a non- governmental organization that piloted the PADETES approach 
with the MoA during the 1990s. Others are more recent entrants into the landscape, gaining 
attention through the Ethiopian Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA), which has actively 
promoted packages comprising these three practices  (ATA, 2013) . Thes e include teff, wheat , and 
maize  row planting, reduced (precise) seeding rate , and  urea top or side dressing . We therefore 
expect to find differential effects of the intervention across the three crops.  
Experimental design  
This study uses a  three- arm stratified cluster  randomized control led trial implemented  in the four 
main regions in Ethiopia  during the 2017 meher  (rainy) season . Stratification was done at the 
level of the w oreda. Cluster s are defined at  the kebele level, which is the primary level at which 
agricultural extension is organized in Ethiopia. Within each woreda, kebeles  were randomly 
allocated to one of three groups:  
T0) A control group (denoted “Control”) in which the Government of Ethiopia’s conventional 
extension approach is  targeted at the (typically male) household;   15 
 T1) A treatment group (denoted “ Regular DG”) in which Digital Green’s standard video -
mediated approach (described above ) is targeted at the (typically male) household head;  
and 
T2) A treatment group (denoted “ DG + spouse ”) in which Digital Green’s standard video -
mediated approach  is targeted at both the household head and his /her spouse . 
With this design, we are able to test the impact of the Digital Green video -mediated 
approach on our outcomes of interest for any household that participated in the treatment (“Any 
DG”, which is equal to T1+T2), and the distinct treatments (T1, T2) separately.  
In each group, the same suite of agricultural technologies and practices w as promoted to 
farmers using the  video -mediated ext ension approach in the treated kebeles  and the conventional 
extension approach in the control kebeles . The three technologies were row planting, more 
precise seeding rates , and urea top or side dressing , and the three crops were teff, wheat, maize. 
The homogene ous content  promoted in the treated and control kebeles  ensures that we can 
evaluat e the medium  used for promotion rather than the content itself. Table 2 summarizes the 
experimental design and the variation in intervention by treatment status.

Outcomes of interest  
Our primary outcomes of interest are: (i) farmers’ access to extension services and advice from 
DAs; (ii) farmers’ awareness and understanding of the subject technologies and practices; and 16 
 (iii) farmers’ uptake of the subject technologies and practices in  the ensuing agricultural season. 
We are further interested in (iv) variations in these outcomes resulting from the distinctly 
gendered targeting strategies used in the two treatment arms.  
We measure farmers’ access to extension services and advice from DA s in several ways, 
all very straightforward and consistent. First, we measure access to extension using farmers’ 
responses to the question, “Has a DA directly provided you with advice/training on <crop>?” for 
each of the three focus crops. Access to extens ion to extension equals 1 if farmers answer to the 
question is in the affirmative and zero if not. To measure the intensity to access, we also look at 
the number of times a DA provided advice for a specific crop. Further, we explore DA effort by 
estimating  treatment effects on whether the DA visited a farmer’s plot and the number of plots 
visited  (Table A6 ).  
We measure knowledge as the score from a set of  questions about the subject 
technologies and practices that were asked of participants in the household survey described 
below. These questions were drawn directly from the list of “non- negotiable” elements of the 
subject technologies and practices as set  forth by the Ethiopian government’s own technical 
recommendations, and as incorporated into both the video and the non- video extension materials 
used by DAs. The knowledge tests were crop- specific, and were made up of 17 questions on teff, 
16 on wheat, and 16 on maize. The questions were multiple choice and each question had one 
correct answer. For each respondent, the number of correct responses were totaled and divided 
by the total number of questions for a given crop yielding a percentage score.  We als o use a 
weighted knowledge score in keeping with Shikuku ( 2019)  where the inverse of the probability 
of answering a question correctly is used to weight correct responses. The final crop- specific 
score is the total of standardized weighted responses to all knowledge test questions.  
Next, we measure uptake of the subj ect technologies and practices, based on participants’ 
responses to questions in the household survey. The question for each crop and technology was 
structured as follows, “During meher  2017- 18 has anyone tried <technology> on your farm?” 
Farmers uptake eq uals 1 if they respond ‘yes’ to the above question and zero if they respond 
‘no’. In the case of row planting, we also calculated the share of area row planted as area row 
planted divided by total area cultivated using plot level data. In the spirit of Rog ers (2010 
[1962]), we use the term “uptake” to describe a farmer’s decision to experiment with or trial a 17 
 new technology or practice either in temporal terms (e.g., experimenting for a single season) or 
spatial terms (e.g., experimenting on a single plot).  This is preferable than to using the term 
“adoption” which implies a more sustained use of the technology over multiple seasons or years, 
or at a larger spatial scale on the farm. We measure uptake as both a binary variable an as an 
intensity, which is th e share of cultivated area (by crop) allocated to the technology or practice.  
Data and sampling  
Data were collected using two separate questionnaires from both household heads and 
spouses. The household head questionnaire covered topics including househol d characteristics, 
assets, access to services, technology adoption, knowledge of agricultural practices, experience 
with video, crop sales, non- farm income, savings, food security, shocks, and plot -level 
information on land use, production, and inputs. The  spouse questionnaire included sections on 
assets, technology adoption, knowledge of agricultural practices, and experience with video.  
A total of 2,422 farm households were randomly selected from 30 woredas and 347 kebeles 
located in the study area (Table 3) . The sampled households were selected using a four- stage 
sampling  process , as follows .  
1. Defining the s tudy population. In the first stage , we purposefully selected 30 woredas  for the 
study based on three criteria: (i) woredas  that were not saturated or fully covered by Digital 
Green prior to the 2017 meher  season ; (ii) woreda s that Digital Green plan ned to expand in to 
in that same season ; and (iii) woredas  that would not be fully saturated during the 2017 
expansion to ensure the presence of within -woreda  control  kebeles . Woreda s with less than 
nine potential expansion kebeles for the 2017 meher  season were excluded from the study.  
2. Stratification  of the treatment at the woreda level. In the second stage , we randomly selected 
kebeles from woredas  with nine or more eligible kebeles .4 Within each woreda, selected 
kebeles  were randomly allocated to  one of  the three treatment arms  such that each arm 
contained  an equal number of kebeles .  
3. Stratification of the sample by development group distance . Even though the  kebele is the 
lowest administrative unit in Ethiopia, it typically comprises several development groups. 
Given the limited number of PICO projector s available for video screenings , it was infeasible 
                                                           
4 In woredas  with 9 -15 kebeles,  we randomly allocated from among those kebeles.  In woredas  with more 
than 15 kebeles,  we randomly chose only 15 kebeles prior to random allocation.  18 
 in all kebeles  for DAs to reach all development groups in a kebele with the video- mediated 
approach . Feedback from people directly involved in the video- mediated approach suggested 
that in such cases , DAs would likely focus their effort on the development groups close to the 
FTC. To  assess the effectiveness of Digital Green’s approach on farmers,  regardless of their 
location, we encouraged D As to first focus their effort on  10 development groups —five of 
which were selected from the closest development groups  (where distance to the FTC was 
less than the  kebele median) , and five from development groups located further away (where 
distance to the FTC was greater than the median) .  
4. Sampling farmers . For the last stage, we randomly select ed seven households from each 
kebele: 2 from the closest  targeted  development group, 2 from the furthest development 
group, and 3 from the development group situated at the  median distance from the FTC.  
Selecting  farmers within the 10 development groups aimed to increase the statistical power 
by ensuring that a large share of the surveyed farmers targeted for treatment at  the kebele 
level did , in fact , participate in  the tre atment . Despite this, and as will be discussed later , the 
participation rate was still limited even with  this sampling procedure.  
The random selection of households for the survey followed the same procedure in both 
treatment and control kebeles , thereby ensur ing comparability of farmers across groups.  Our 
design sought not to affect, in any possible way, the way extension was conducted  in the control  
kebeles . For this reason, we did not encourage DAs to focus their attention on 10 development 
groups as we  did in the treatment group kebeles . We discuss the implication of this difference  
below. 
Additional data were collected with a survey of 896 extension agents at baseline (2017) and 
followed up with midline survey (2018) of 781 DAs. A ll DAs i n service in the selected kebeles  
in all three arms of the trial were included in the sample of respondents for the se survey s. The 
DA baseline survey collected information on their profiles, motivation, workload, and kebele-
level production figures for the  previous year.  19

Timeline  
Figure 1 summarizes the timeline of Digital Green’s intervention and our accompanying study6. 
We first conducted a baseline survey of all DAs working in our study kebeles  during April –May 
2017, just prior to the 2017 meher  season. After the baseline, we conducted extensive training on 
the study design for woreda- level Bureau of Agriculture functionaries and DAs , in collaboration 
with Digital Green , to ensure experimental integrity .  
After these trainings, the intervention was implemented by woreda- level subject matter 
specialists and DAs with support from Digital Green throughout the main production period of 
the meher  season ( June-September 2017). We also conducted a rapid assessment of the 
implementation process during the initial implementation in order  to provide Digital Green with 
feedback on operations and progress. The household survey and DA follow -up survey were 
conducted Ja nuary -March 2018, after the harvest  for all three crops .  
  
                                                           
5 Random assignment of kebeles  to treatment and control groups was stratified by woreda . This implies that each of 
the 30 woredas  selected for the study contained kebeles  assigned to both treatment groups and the control group. For 
this reason, a total of 30 woredas  are shown in the la st column.  
6 This timeline represents the first year of the study. The intervention continued for a second year in 2018. 
Analysis of data from year 2 are in progress and results are forthcoming.  20

Experimental integrity  
Balance of initial characteristics  
We assess the extent to which random assignment of the treatment  generated comparable 
treatment and control  groups at different levels —kebele, household head , spouse , and DA. First, 
we check for balance between treatment and control groups at the household level and find that 
these groups are comparable on household level variables ( Table 4). Next , we run balance tests  
on baseline levels of our  main outcome variables  of interest, measured using farmer recall data. 
We find no statistically significant difference between the treatme nt groups for most outcome 
variables  (Table 4) . However, we do observe a small difference between “Control ” and “ Regular 
DG”  on prior experience with recommended  seeding rates and urea top dressing  for teff, and 
between “Control ” and “ DG + S pouse ” for recommended  seeding rates for wheat ( Table 5).  
Balance  tests for household spouse - and DA -level covariates and kebele characteristics are 
reported in Appendix  Table A1 –Table A3 , and indicate that the control and treatment groups  are 
comparable both at the  spouse and kebele level s.  
Compliance with treatment assignment  
Next, w e test whether field implementation of the intervention complied with the research 
design . We do this  by assessing the extent to which sample households participated in the 
intervention. We find relatively low levels of compliance for treatment households  (Table 6 ). A 
total of 41 percent and 42 percent of households in the “ Regular DG ” and “DG + spouse ” groups 
participated in  least one video -mediated extension activity , respectively. On the other hand, the 
level of contamination of the intervention in t he “Control ” is low —only 4 percent of the sample 21 
 households from the control group participated in video- mediated extension training. Table 6  also 
assesses the participation rates in video -mediated extension by crop and video topic. We find no 
discernable differences in participation patterns by crop and topic.  22

Empirical strategy  
Our empirical strategy closely follows the study design through simple comparisons of mean 
outcomes across treatment and control groups. We focus here on i ntent to t reat (ITT) estimates , 
which capture the effect of being randomly allocated to a kebele wher e video -mediated extension 
approach was introduced, regardless of whether the household member(s) actually participated in 
a video screening. To estimate the se ITT effects , we include all sample households —whether or 
not they were actually “treated” ( i.e., received  extension services )—in our analysis . Thus, we are 
estimating the intervention’s effect on the group for whom it was intended.  
We restrict our analysis to ITT estimates for two reasons. One is statistical. T o estimate 
the Treatment E ffect on the Treated  (TOT)—the impact of the intervention on those who were 
actually “treated”—one  needs to assume an absence of spillovers from participants to non-
participants within a given kebele. Given the nature of how information is shared between peers  
within a  kebele, we argue that such an assumption is overly restrictive . The other reason is 
operational . From a policy perspective, ITT estimates are often more relevant as they measure 
average changes in outcomes across all individuals that are targeted by the intervention. Given 
that 100 percent compliance with the intervention is nearly impossible in a real -world  scenario , 25 
 ITT estimates are a good proxy for the impacts  that can be expect ed beyond the  experimental 
scenario.  
We estimate ITT effects using  ordinary l east s quare (OLS) with the following 
specification :   
𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖=𝛼𝛼+𝛽𝛽𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘+𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖′𝛿𝛿+𝜇𝜇𝑤𝑤+𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖   (1)  
where 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 denotes  the level of outcome  𝑦𝑦 measured at the household level 𝑖𝑖 (for instance whether 
the household has tried row -planting of a wheat plot over the study period). The variable 𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘 
indicates the treatment status of k ebele 𝑘𝑘 which, in this specification , clubs both treatment arms 
(“Regular DG ” and “ DG + spouse ”) into a single treatment (“Any DG”).  The variable 𝑋𝑋 is a 
vector of household-  and development group- level characteristics that account for baseline 
imbalances between groups and augment s the overall power of our estimates . These include 
distance to nearest FTC, whether household head received formal education, distance to nearest 
dry season road, distance to nearest all -weather road, and distance to nearest marketplace. We 
account for woreda- level stratification of our design through 𝜇𝜇𝑤𝑤, a set of woreda- level fixed 
effects. Last ly, we account for treatment assignment at  the kebele level by clustering standard 
errors at that level.  
We also estimate ITT effects for each of the  two treatment arms that measure the 
differential impact of video -mediated extension when it is targeted only to heads of households 
(“Regular DG ”) and when it includes both the heads and spouses in the same household ( “DG + 
spouse ”). This differential effect is estimated as :     
𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖=𝛼𝛼+𝛽𝛽1𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘1+𝛽𝛽2𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘2+𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖′𝛿𝛿+𝜇𝜇𝑤𝑤+𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖 (2) 
where 𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘1 is treatment for “Regular DG ” and 𝑇𝑇𝑘𝑘2 is treatment for “ DG + spouse ”. We also test for 
the equality of coefficient s between “ Regular DG ” and “ DG + spouse ” (i.e.,  𝛽𝛽1=𝛽𝛽2) to assess 
the additional effect of tr eating spouses in households where the head of the household is treated.  
Next, we consider two issues related to selection: one regarding cropping patterns, and the other 
regarding participation in extension activities.  26 
 First, b ecause a given technology may not have the same constraints or relevance across 
crops, for most outcomes we restrict our estimation of the intervention’s impact to the sample of 
households cultivating one of t he three focus crops (teff, wheat , or maize).  However, i f treatment 
allocation affected crop choices , then the sub- sample of households cultivating a particular crop 
may no longer be fully comparable across treatment groups, which could bias the treatment 
estimates. We expect these effects to be limited  for two reasons. One, Digital Green ’s 
intervention was introduced relatively late in the season, at a time when most households had 
already made their choices about  crops to be grown. This is further support ed by results in 
Appendix Table A4  which provides  no evidence to suggest that one’s decision to grow each of 
the three crops is affected by one’s treatment status. Two , cropping patterns in the study area 
tend to be static from year to year since time -invariant factors such as site- specific 
agroecological characteristics tend to dictate crop choices.  
Second, and as described above, DAs in treatment groups were encouraged ( but not 
compelled, and not monitored) to first focus their video- mediated extension effort s to 10 
development groups from which we later sampled households randoml y for our household 
survey . This design may lead to an over -representation of extension participants in our treatment 
groups  as compared to the control group. Further, if DAs in the control group target ed their effort 
to particular  types of development groups (for instance, those closer to FTCs), extension 
participants may not be fully comparable across samples. While our main estimation strategy 
relies on the above -described ITT, we also test for the robustness of these results when restricting 
the samp le to those development groups effectively reached by DAs in the treatment or control 
kebeles , that is, those development groups where at least one farmer received advice from a DA . 
However, our results are not meaningfully affected by this , such that the obtained ITT results are 
unlikely to be driven by selection and can be interpreted as an ITT estimate of the video -
mediated extension approach’s impact.

 4. RESULTS  
This section presents results from estimation of Equations  (1) and (2) on a series of outcomes 
including : access to extension ; improvements in knowledge about the subject technologies and 
practices; and the uptake of the subject technologies and practices . For each, we present a 
graphical representation of the overall treatment ef fect, alongside details on the separate 
treatment effects for “DG regular” and “DG + spouse” in a related table.  
Extension access and knowledge outcomes  
We find evidence of an increase in  access to extension by farmers in kebeles  selected for video -
mediated extension  (Table 7, Panel A, columns 1, 3, and 5) . These results indicate that a farmer 
in a treated kebele is, on average, 10.8 percentage points more likely to have received DA advice 
regarding teff cultivation than a farmer in a control kebele. With 45.3 percent  of the farmers 
having received such advice in the control kebeles,  the effect of the video -mediat ed approach 
represents a 23.8 percent  increase over the control kebeles . This effect is not limited to farmers 
cultivating teff : comparable  (in fact , larger ) effects are found for farmers cultivating wheat and 
maize. In the case of wheat, treated farmers are 15.6 percentage points more likely to have 
received DA advice, a 36.7  percent  increase over the mean of farmers in the control  kebeles . For 
maize, treated farmers are 12.4 percentage points more likely to have received DA advice, a 24.9 
percent  increas e over the mean of the control kebeles . 
Our results are robust to several other measures of access, including dichotomous 
measures (whether a DA provided advice to a farmer, and whether a DA visited a farmer’s plot), 
intensity measures (the number of times a DA provided advice to a farmer, or vi sited a farmer’s 
plot), and crop- specific measures (the number of a farmer’s plots visited by a DA, for any crop 
vs. the crops specifically targeted by the intervention). We also explore heterogenous effects of 
distance to FTC on these different measures o f access. We find small positive effects on access 
(measured by the dichotomous and intensity measures) for respondents situated medium distance 
from the FTC. These results are presented in Appendix Table A7 –Table A8 . Columns 2, 4 and 6 
of Table 7 further disaggregate results between the “Regular DG” and “DG + spouse” treatment 
groups. We do not find evidence of differential treatment effects across these groups —where the 
respondent is  the head of household—as indicated by the reported tests of equality of 
coefficients.  28 
  Panel B of Table 7 reports similar estimates, but uses responses provided by spouse of 
the household head. These results indicate that the “DG + spouse” treatment led to a significant 
increase in spouses’ access to DA advice, even when the “Regular DG” did not. Specifically , 
spouses in the “DG + spouse” group are 4.7 percentage points more likely to have received DA 
advice on wheat, a 25.1 percent increase over spouses in the control group. Similarly, for maize, 
spouses in the “DG + spouse” group are 5.3 percentage points more likely to have received DA 
advice, a 20.1 percent increase over spouses in the control group.

We find similar results when we restrict our sample to those development groups where 
at least one farmer received advice from a DA, indicating that the intervention did not lead to a 29 
 change in the type of development group that DAs decided to work with, but rather to a change 
in their reach to farmers within these groups ( Table 8 ). We also find comparable results on the 
application of DAs advise at the plot level ( Table A10 ).

Next, we investigate whether video -mediated extension led to improvements in farmers’ 
knowledge and understanding of the focal technologies and practices. Table 9 report s results on 
farmers’ scores on the  knowledge tests conducted during the survey of household heads  and 
spouses . Results are reported as percentage increases  in knowledge test scores  attributable to the 
treatment .  
On average, farmers in the control group kebeles  responded correctly to 37- 43 percent  of 
the questions, depending on the crop. Our results point to small (1 -2 percent age point ) increases  
in knowledge  test scores  among farmers in treated kebeles . These results are only statistically 
significant for the sub -group of teff producers. Note , however, that results in  Panel A of  Table 9 
suggest some potential differences across our two treatment arms. In particular, while the 
“Regular DG” treatment led to no increase in knowledge scores for farmers cultivating wheat, 
“DG + spouse” did lead to an increase in knowledge scores for household heads  (Table 9, Panel 
A).  30

 Panel B of  Table 9 reports results  for the same estimations based on responses from the 
surveyed spouses. We find that “DG + spouse” led to positive and significant effect on spouses’ 
knowledge, while “DG regular” did not. However, this effect is limited to farmers cultivating teff 
and whe at only. In the case of teff, spouses in the “DG + spouse” group scored 1.4 percent more 
than those in the control group, which translates to a 4.3 percent increase over the mean of the 
control group. Similarly, for wheat, spouses in the “DG + spouse” group scored 1.6 percent more 
than those in the control group, an increase of 4.8 percent over the control . 
Overall, the r esults suggest that DG’s video- mediated extension approach led to an 
increased reach of farmers by DAs, which translated into small increases in knowledge. As 
expected, these effects are broadly similar across treatment groups when one considers 
household head respondents. However, they are significantly higher in the “DG + spouse” group, 
when one considers spouse respondents. This supports existing evidence that agricultural 
extension in Ethiopia is mainly targeted at household heads only. In the following sections, we 
investigate whether this may be a source of inefficiency.  Of the 2082 spouses in our sample 37 
were male spouses and 4 were male household heads responding for the female spouses. We find 
that our spouse estimates  for access to extension  are robust to restricting our sample to  the 2041 
female spouses where the respondent was female ( Table A15 –Table A17 ).  
Technology uptake 
We now turn to farmers’ uptake of the technologies and practices promoted in the intervention: 
row planting, recommended  seeding rates, and urea top or side  dressing. We see an overall 
positive impact of the  video- mediated approach on farmers’ decision to experiment with or trial a 
technology during the 2017/18 meher  season . Effects are somewhat comparable in magnitude 
across crops and technologies, ranging from a 3 -10 percentage point increase in uptake. Relative 
to the mean of the control group, these increases represent substantial differences  in uptak e in the 
treatment groups . For example, the 6 percentage -point increase in teff row planting observed 
among farmers in treated kebeles  translates into a 36 percent increase over the mean of the 
control  (Table 10, Panel A ). Similar patterns are found for recommended seeding rates and urea 
dressing, with larger increases observed for teff and wheat relative to maize ( Table 11 and Table 
12, respectively) . These crop -specific findings are consistent with the fact that the subject 
technologies and practices for maize have been part of Ethiopia’s extension packages for a much 
longer time . 32 
 We further report on the intensity of uptake, or the share of cultivated area on which 
farmers applied row planting  (Table 10, Panel A ).  Results are consistent with those obtained 
from the binary uptake variable.  For example, between farmers in treatment and control  kebeles , 
we find a 0.067 and 0.053 percentage point difference in the share of teff and wheat area row 
planted, respectively. This translates to a 48 percent  and 23 percent  increase over the mean of the 
control for teff and wheat, respectively.   
We further disagg regate results by treatment arm. We do not find evidence of statistically 
significant treatment effects. This suggests  that the increase in DA access and knowledge 
attributable to the video -mediated approach did not translate in changes in the households’ 
technology adoption decision above and beyond that of the “ Regular DG” treatment arm. These 
results are supported by plot -level estimates of the uptake of row planting (Table A9 ), where we 
interact our treatment variable with the gender of plot owner. Our results show no marginal “DG 
+ Spouse” effects beyond those of the “Regular DG” approach even where the spouse is the 
(partial) owner of the plot. We find that our spouse estimates for technology adoption are robust 
to restricting our sample to female spouses where the respondent was female ( Table A15 –Table 
A17). 
Finally, we pooled the “Regular DG” and “DG + spouse” treatment groups and examined  
heterogeneous effects  along three dimensions —distance to FTC, whether there was a model 
farmer in the household, and asset quantiles ( Table A18 –Table A20 ). We find no evidence of 
distance to FTC affecting adoption of row planting, recommended seeding rates, or urea dressing 
for teff, wheat or maize , except that farmers livin g far from the FTC in treatment kebeles  are less 
likely to adopt urea top dressing. We find no differential effects in adoption for households with 
model farmers in treatment kebeles . With regard to heterogeneity in asset holdings, we find that 
treatment h ouseholds in the top half of the asset distribution are less likely to use the 
recommended seeding rate. 33

These results are interesting from several angles. First, if we cast the “DG + Spouse” 
treatment as a doubling of extension intensity —a two -fold increase in the household’s exposure 
to and interaction with DAs through the video- mediated approach—we might expect to find 
stronger effects on uptake than the singular “Regular DG” approach. However, we also 
recognize that there are several factors that militate against this hypothesis. A simple explanation 
may be that decision -making on crop management practices is strictly reserved to male 
household heads. But that is a rather weak explanation given the prevalence of women- headed 
households i n which women do make decisions on crop management practices in Ethiopia. A 
more sophisticated explanation would explore the dynamics of intra -household decision- making 
as a function of the distribution of bargaining power and sociocultural norms, taking a dvantage 
of Ethiopia’s rich heterogeneity that is also captured in our sample. Such analysis would be 36 
 consistent with the analysis of bargaining power in Ethiopia by Mabsout and Staveren (2010) 
and gender relations in Ethiopia’s wheat sector by Drucza and Tsegaye (2018), notwithstanding 
gains made by rural Ethiopian women as a result of land and social welfare policy changes 
evaluated by Kumar and Quisumbing (2015). In addition to this, it would be useful to evaluate 
these effects in relation to gender -unintentional (Gates, 2014) extension provision, consistent 
with findings of Ragasa et al. (2013), within the context of the video- mediated approach. This is 
a topic for future research.  
Crop yields 
Finally, we examine the intervention’s effect on crop yield s. Initially,  we find no statistically 
significant effects of the treatment on yield s based on farmers’ self -reported area and harvest 
quantit y (Table A11 –Table A12 ). We then examine yields based on the same harvest quantities, 
but us e area calculated from plot perimeters collected with GPS devices for a random sub- sample 
of parcels within a 45- minute walk from the respondents’ dwellings . With this measurement,  we 
do find a significant and positive effect of the treatment for teff at the  plot level , with the video-
mediated intervention resulting in a 15- 20 percent  increase in teff yields  (Table A13) . These 
findings are robust to control ling for plot ownership. However, w e do not find similar results for 
the other crops.  
While evidence of a treatment effect on teff yields is encouraging, the general findings 
also reflect the ongoing discussion about area, production, and yield measurement  error in 
household surveys that rely fully or partly on farmers’ own assessments of plot size and harvest 
quantities . Recent evidence from Ethiopia illustrates  the extent and magnitude of this problem in 
sharp relief (Abate et al. 2015; Abay et al., 2019) . We attribute the non- results on wheat and 
maize yield s for both measurement approaches to the fact that several of the subject practices 
have been shown to offer limited yield gains under farmers’ conditions in Ethiopia. R esults from 
a randomized controlled trial of the Ethiopian government’s wheat technology package  
conducted by  Abate et al. (2018) found a 14 percent increase on wheat yields, but only when 
measured with crop cuts and with farmer predicted yields that control for farmer type and 
household characteristics; farmers’ actual reported yields showed a smaller and statistically 
insignificant yield attributable to the package. They explain this difference in outcomes to 
measurement errors in plot size and  advise caution in the use of both f armer -reported plot sizes 
and output. This is consistent with similar findings from a randomized controlled trial of row 37 
 planting and lower seeding rates for teff conducted by Vandercasteelen et al. (2020, 2018), 
which found no statistically significant ef fects of the package on yields, whether measured with 
data from crop cuts or calculated from farmer -reported output and enumerator -measured area. 
Although the results of this particular study differ from ours, it raises similar issues about area, 
production, and yield measurement error in the Ethiopian context.  
5. COST -EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS 
While results thus far point to an increase in technology uptake resulting from the video-
mediated extension approach, a  key tenet of the approach is its potential to incr ease adoption 
rates at a relatively low cost per farmer .7 In this section, we analyze the cost  effectiveness of the 
video- mediated approach using the results presented earlier and project cost data provided by 
Digital Green.  
Because t he video -mediated approach is an intervention designed to augment  the existing 
extension system , we calculate the cost per additional  adoption resulting from the approach. This 
is a measure of marginal cost -effectiveness, which is the incremental  cost of an additional 
adoption that results from adding the video -mediated approach to the existing system. We define 
the marginal cost -effectiveness ratio (MCER) as:  
𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡𝑗𝑗=𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑗𝑗
𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑗𝑗    (1) 
where 𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑗𝑗 measures the total cost s of using video -mediated extension to promote technology j in 
year t  in the sample of woredas  and kebeles  assigned to the intervention p. The term 𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑗𝑗 denotes 
the corresponding number of additional adopters, that is, those farmers who would not  have 
adopted technology j had there been no video- mediated approach  in their locality .  
Costs used in our calculations  include the incremental cost of Digital Green’s video -
mediated approach compared to the conventional extension approach, which can be expressed  as 
follows. 
                                                           
7 We revert to the use of the term “adoption” here simply for ease of exposition, and still recognize that 
results reflect farmers experimenting with or trialing the subject technologies and practices.  38 
 Costs  =  �𝒄𝒄𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒋𝒋�  (2) 
Drawing on Digital Green’s own internal cost -effectiveness analysis manual and Mogues 
et al. (2017), we focus on project -level costs associated with the video -mediated approach. 
Digital Green’s costs include personnel co sts, training costs, operational costs, capital costs, and 
indirect costs incurred only in kebeles  where video -mediated extension was conducted. We 
consider two cost scenarios: one which captures the marginal cost effectiveness of the 
intervention based on the coverage of the randomized controlled trial reported on in this paper 
(the “Experimental Scenario”); and another which assumes that the intervention is targeted to all 
kebeles  in the targeted woredas , and to all development groups in each kebele (a “saturation” 
scenario).  
Table 13 summarizes all costs that we account for in this analysis. Several features of 
these costs are worth highlighting. First,  the costs analyzed here are the total costs incurred by 
Digital Green in promoting the video -mediated approach in this intervention during  one meher  
season (2017), in 240 kebeles  in 30 woredas . Second, certain  costs are recurrent, such as 
personnel, opera tional, and indirect costs. For other costs such as equipment (computers, 
cameras, PICO projectors) and DA training costs, we assume a three -year lifespan, such that 
annualized costs represent one -third of the effective cost incurred during the one -year 
implementation of intervention.  
Third, other  costs can be classified as f ixed costs. This includes costs  at the woreda- level 
(see upper panel in Table 13).  This implies that their contribution to the total cost is only affected 
by the number of woredas , not by the number of kebeles  in each woreda. For example, extension 
staff need only one camer a and one computer per woreda to produce and record videos, 
irrespective of whether one or all kebeles  in a given woreda are targeted. Other costs are fixed at 
the kebele- level (lower panel in Table 13). This means that their contribution to the total cost is 
affected by the number of kebeles , but not by the number of development groups targeted in each 
kebele. For example, extension staff needs  only one PICO projector per kebele  to screen videos 
to farmers .  
We take three technologies into consideration with respect to adoption rates : row 
planting, recommended seeding rates , and urea top or side dressing. We assign the same weight 
to each techno logy in the absence of additional information on how to otherwise assign these 39 
 weights . Thus, the cost per technology is obtained from dividing the total costs by three. W ith 
this in mind, we let 𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑗𝑗 measure the yearly total costs of using video -media ted extension to 
promote technology j in 240 kebeles  in 30 woredas .

Next, w e measure the percent increase in the adoption rate of technology j attributable to 
the video- mediated approach  using estimates of the coefficient 𝛽𝛽 on the treatment variable 𝑇𝑇 
specified in  Equation 1 earlier . Since we use ITT estimates, the coverage area consists of the 
development groups and their  members in the treatment group  that were targeted by the 
intervention. If we let 𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡𝑗𝑗 be the number of targeted households in the treatment kebeles , then the 
total number of additional adopters can be expressed as : 
𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑗𝑗=𝛽𝛽𝑗𝑗𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡𝑗𝑗 
Corresponding estimates are provided in Table 14  below, under the “Experimental scenario”  
column. 40

𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑗𝑗=𝑐𝑐𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑗𝑗
𝛽𝛽𝑗𝑗𝑁𝑁𝑡𝑡𝑗𝑗 
In Figure 2, we report the marginal costs of adoption for each of the three technologies 
considered. Under the experimental scenario , the cost of each additional adoption of row 
planting was USD 30 (ETB 691) .8 Similarly, for recommended  seeding rates  and urea  dressing, 
the cost of each additional adoption was USD 16 ( ETB 376) and USD 18 ( ETB 424) , 
respectively.  
In Figure 2 we also report MCERs under the saturation scenario. The corresponding 
increase in coverage is shown in column 3 of Table 14. On the cost side, as shown in column 4 
of Table 13, those that are fixed at the woreda- level are not affected by the increase in per -
woreda coverage. However, all kebele- level costs increase with the number of additional kebeles  
that are included. To account for the potential difficulties of reaching all development groups in a 
kebele with one PICO projector, we account for two PICO projectors per kebele in the saturation 
scenario.

Given the particular importance of fixed costs at the woreda level, the associated MCERs 
under full saturation are much lower than that of the experimental coverage. Securing one 
additional adoption of row planting costs just USD 6 (ETB 144); recommended s eeding rates just 
USD 3 (ETB 78), and urea dressing costs just USD 4 (ETB 88) ( Table 15).

 6. CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS  
Overall, several important findings emerge from our evaluation of the video- mediated extension 
approach employed by MoA, Digital Green, and t he regional bureaus of agriculture across 
Ethiopia’s main agricultural regions. First, the approach  has a demonstrated capacity to reach a 
wider audience than the conventional approach employed by DAs and woreda- level extension 
staff, with gain s observed particu larly for spouses of the (typically male) heads of household. 
Second, the approach leads to higher levels of knowledge about the subject technologies and 
practices, again with gains observed for spouses. Third, the video- mediated approach results in 
increased uptake of the  technologies and practices that are central to the extension program of 
MoA and the regional bureaus. O ur estimates indicate that the video -mediated approach led to a 
3 to 10 percentage point increases in uptake of many of the  technologies  and practices (row 
planting, recommended  seeding rates , and urea top or side dressing) recommended for teff, 
wheat, and maize cultivation . These estimates  represent up to a 35 percent  increase in uptake of a 
given technology for a given crop w hen compared to mean of the control group.  
While these results hold when both the head of household and the spouse are targeted  by 
the video- mediated approach, we do not observe any marginal gains in uptake rates  by treating 
both. This suggests the need for further analysis of the gender dimensions of video- mediated 
extension. As suggested by Doss (2015), “whether or not specific interventions should explicitly 
target women rather than men, it is clear that a gender -blind approach to designing interventions 
will miss out on key constraints, opportunities, and impacts.”  There is value in disentangling 
inequalities in intra -household bargaining power from social institutions and cultural norms, and 
further disentangling these effects from gender -unintentiona l practices within the extension 
system.  
Importantly, we do not find statistically significant yield effects resulting from the video -
mediated approach. We attribute this to challenges in accurately measuring both output and area. 
This opens the door to fu ture research that integrates more accurate ground -truthing methods for 
yield measurement such as crop cuts with yield estimation using satellite imagery and associated 
analytical tools.  43 
 Despite th is, it is also important to recognize the policy relevance of our findings . Unlike 
many prior studies on ICTs in agricultural extension, the program studied here represents a large -
scale intervention of the Ethiopian government that is fully integrated into existing policy and 
practice. We provide clear evidence of the potential contribution of video mediation to existing 
extension  policy and program ming  in Ethiopia and encourage further innovation in the 
program’s design to generate additional outcomes.  We also assess the marginal cost -
effectiveness of the video -mediated approach under the experimental and a full saturation 
scenario. The cost of each additional adoption under the experimental scenario ranges from USD 
16 – 30. However, these figures decrease to USD 3 – 6 when we assume that the video- mediated 
approach is extended to all kebeles  in the treatment woredas . 
Further, this study helps shift focus in national and global discourse on agricultural 
extension to the power that ICTs can have in augmenting —rather than replacing —extension 
services and agents. This, in turn, may draw attention to more constructive ways of thinking 
about lowering costs, improving efficiency, and increasing the impact of existing extension 
systems, while drawing attention away from offhanded dismissals of thes e systems as relics of 
past eras. Clearly, and despite what skeptics may suggest, there remains some value to be gained 
from direct, person- to-person interaction s between extension agents and farmers.  
As Ethiopia and other developing countries explore innovative ways to strengthen their  
extension and advisory services to farmers , these findings provide much -needed evidence on 
what works —and for whom —in the arena of innovative extension methods and tools.
