8  |  USAID/JORDAN  USAID.GOV  INTRODUCTION  
The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is located on the East Bank of the Jordan River and is bordered by 
Saudi Arabia to the south, Iraq to the east, Syria to the north, and Israel and Palestine to the west. In 
1946, Jordan gained its independence after signing the Treaty of London, effectively ending 30 years 
under British rule. It has a population of 10.4 million people, roughly one -third of whom are not 
Jordanian citizens (World Bank, 2019a; United Nations, 2019b).   
Over the last five decades, Jordan has expe rienced significant progress establishing state institutions, 
promoting economic growth, and increasing social welfare. Life expectancy at birth has increased from 
52.6 years in 1960 to 74.3 in 2016. Similarly, the country’s gross domestic product per capi ta has 
increased from USD $511 in 1965 to USD $4,129 in 2017. Lastly, the poverty headcount ratio (estimated at $1.90 2011 PPP a day) has decreased from 2.9% in 1992 to 0.1% in 2010.  
Despite a lack of abundance of resources or land, Jordan plays a crucial  role in Middle Eastern politics. 
The country is a key ally of the United States and one of only two Arab nations that have made peace with Israel. Although Jordan is not a party to the 1951 Convention on Refugees or its 1967 Protocol, 
the Kingdom has been  a haven for forced migrants since the Palestinian exodus of 1948. Jordan’s current 
refugee population is estimated to be 1.1 million, including Syrians, Iraqis, Yemenis, and others.  
The civil war in Syria and the consequent influx of refugees has become one of Jordan’s most difficult 
socioeconomic challenges to manage – the country has experienced an increased competition for jobs 
as well as infrastructure and strained social services such as healthcare and education. Additionally, 
Jordan faces several daunting challenges as it strives to attain its development and reform goals while also taking advantage of potential opportunities such as a young workforce and improving health and 
education levels. These challenges include a rapidly growing population, ga ps in the provision of basic 
education, high unemployment, weak citizen participation in governance and politics, water scarcity, 
reliance on expensive imported energy, and gender disparities (USAID, 2018a).  
USAID SUPPORT TO JOR DAN  
The United States has pr ovided assistance to Jordan since 1952, years before the creation of USAID. 
While aid initially focused on military and infrastructure development assistance, today, USAID’s development strategy includes programs in education, water, economic development, energy, 
democracy, rights and governance, health, and gender equality and female empowerment. Additionally, USAID supports Jordan’s efforts to address the current refugee crisis in the country while building resilience to support national stability. The 20 13-2019 USAID Country Development Cooperation 
Strategy (CDCS) identified three development objectives as well as a special development objective:  
• Broad -based, Inclusive Economic Development Accelerated  
• Democratic Accountability Strengthened;  
• Social Sector Quality Improved; and  
• Gender Equality and Female Empowerment Enhanced  
USAID support to Jordan in the immediate future will be essential to helping the Kingdom create more sustainable strategies for economic development, provide better services for its popu lation, equip the USAID.GOV   STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS |  9 country’s youth with employability and life skills, and spur economic growth, especially for disadvantaged 
populations.  
DEMOCRACY, RIGHTS AN D GOVERNANCE  
The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is a constitutional monarchy in which significant pol itical power rests 
with the King and within the central government. The Kingdom is divided into twelve governorates and several smaller political districts comprised primarily of Bedouin tribal groups. The Parliament, which can 
be dissolved unilaterally by  the King, was suspended from 1967 to 1989, after which it was reintroduced. 
It is popularly elected with quotas established for geographic regions, religious populations and women.  
Domestically, the government balances its policies to represent two prima ry factions of Jordanian 
society – although there is considerable overlap. Jordanians of primarily Bedouin descent –  or East Bank 
Jordanians - have historically (and to a lesser extent today) received preferential treatment in 
government hiring and form th e bulk of the population employed in the military, government and public 
sector. This population, to a large extent reliant on the public sector, has generally advocated for continued state intervention in the economy and are accommodated by public service s and subsidization 
policies.  
The second group –  Jordanians of Palestinian origin – have historically been prevented (unofficially) from 
attaining positions within the public service, including especially leadership positions in the security forces. This population has focused on the private sector and comprise much of the business elite of the 
country which favors more neoliberal policies and greater integration into the global economy. “Since 
parliamentary life was reintroduced with the 1989 elections, t he division of parliamentary seats across 
the Kingdom has favored populations outside of the three largest urban centers, Amman, Irbid and al -
Zarqa, where the majority of Jordan’s Jordanian -Palestinian population reside” (Bertelsmann Stiftung, 
2018:  7). 
Jordan is an upper -middle income country, but in the poorer ranks of this category, and by those 
standards, it performs well by most metrics for governance. According to the World Bank Worldwide 
Governance Indicator data for 2017, Jordan scores well above average for the lower -middle income 
group in the areas of government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law and control of corruption. 
It scores below the average in the areas of political stability and voice and accountability. In each of 
these cate gories, it also scores above the average for the MENA region. However, on a less optimistic 
note, Jordan’s scores in the areas of political stability, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law have all decreased during the last decade (Worl d Bank, 2017).  
ELECTORAL GOVERNANCE  
Jordan has a bicameral parliament with a 65 -seat upper house (Majlis al -Ayan) appointed by the King and 
a popularly elected lower house (Majlis al- Nuwab). The size of the lower house has fluctuated with 
nearly every recent election, but is currently set at 130 seats, of which 115 are elected with the 
remainder reserved for women chosen to represent each of the 12 governorates and 3 Badia districts 
for Bedouin representatives. Twelve of the seats in the lower house are reserved for religious and 
ethnic minorities. The terms of service for representatives of each house is four years. The government 
is structured such that despite the presence of a freely elected lower house of parliament, political 
authority is concentrated  in the executive branch (Freedom House, 2018a).  10  |  USAID/JORDAN  USAID.GOV  In 2015, Jordan passed a new election law that changed the nature of representation from a one -person -
one-vote system to a proportional system. “The new law also redrew district lines to mitigate acute 
malapportionment that had long placed urban voters at a disadvantage and inflated the influence of the 
regime’s rural supporters. However, even after the changes, rural and tribal voters remained heavily 
overrepresented” (Freedom House, 2018a). Among the other  notable changes implemented with the 
2015 Election law is the lowering of the voting age to 17 years (Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2018).  
Parliamentary elections are administered by an Independent Election Commission (IEC) that was 
established in 2013. Although irregularities continue to be reported for the most recent elections, the 
IEC has generally received positive reviews. “In the most recent elections, cameras were installed in voting booths to ensure propriety and build public confidence, and approximatel y 86% of the votes cast 
were ruled to be valid. While public confidence improved as a consequence of these measures, it 
remains fragile” (Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2018).  
There is universal suffrage in Jordan, although active members of the army and security forces are not 
permitted to vote. There are quotas for women in both national parliamentary and sub- national council 
elections, but women have generally fared poorly in both outside of the quota system. In the 2016 
parliamentary elections, five wo men were elected Deputies outside of the quotas, while in the 2017 
local elections, only four women won governorate council seats beyond those reserved for women. 
There have been modest recent improvements in the numbers of women candidates running for office 
(10% of all candidates in 2013 versus 20% in 2016), but these have not generally translated to electoral 
gains for women candidates. Cultural prejudices remain the main obstacle to women’s full participation 
in practice (Freedom House, 2018a).  
As of 20 16, Jordan had 31 recognized political parties, which fall into four broad categories: Islamist 
parties, Arab nationalists, leftists and national conservatives. The largest of these groups is Islamists and 
the largest and best organized of the Islamist par ties is the Islamic Action Front (IAF), which has 
boycotted Jordan’s most recent parliamentary elections until 2016. In 2016, the IAF partnered with several other parties to form the National Coalition for Reform (NCR). Although the NCR won the 
most seats of any political party, independent candidates won a far greater percentage of overall seats and the NCR won fewer seats than the IAF had won on its own during the last election in which it 
participated (2003). Despite the relatively high number of politic al parties, very few have organizational 
strength, and in a recent USAID- sponsored poll, three -quarters of respondents did not know the name 
of any political party (Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2018; Center for Insights in Survey Research, 2018). To date, 
Jordani an voters have continued to predominantly vote for independent candidates based upon familial, 
tribal, or ethnic ties, or for local development (Singh, 2017).  
The 2016 parliamentary elections were implemented without violence and were deemed by 
internation al monitors to be free and fair.  However, voter turnout was far lower (31%) than it had 
been in previous elections, including 2013 (58%) (IFES, 2019). Turnout was also uneven in several 
important respects. Post -election surveys noted that turnout was low among young people, who 
expressed apathy at the electoral process, and among urban dwellers, possibly reflecting the continued gerrymandering that dilutes the voting power of this constituency (Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD), 2017; Freedom House, 2018a). For example, turnout in the rural Southern Badia district was 83%, whereas turnout in Amman was only 23.5% (OECD, 2017) . USAID.GOV   STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS |  11 SECTOR STRATEGIC ISS UES 
• While women have universal suffrage, the proportion of female parliamentarians rem ains low, 
with most of the seats held by women required by the quota system. Continued cultural 
prejudices against women serving in these roles serves as a de facto ceiling on increased 
representation by women absent increases in the quota (Freedom House, 2018a).  
• Political parties are largely poorly managed and organized. As a result, they have not to date 
been effective in persuading voters and capturing elected positions – most of which still tend to 
be filled by independent candidates based upon tribal considerations (Bertelsmann Stiftung, 
2018).  
• The very low turnout of the 2016 parliamentary election suggests that voters are apathetic about the democratic process as it currently exists. There is reason to believe that the relative 
weakness of elected of ficials (vis -à-vis the executive) and the disproportionate representation of 
rural areas are contributing factors.  
USAID PORTFOLIO HIGH LIGHTS  
The USAID Elections and Political Processes Project (2017- 2020) encourages and enables more 
pluralistic and repre sentative political competition in Jordan by strengthening the foundation for political 
participation and democratic development throughout the Kingdom. This project is a successor to the 
Consortium for Elections and Political Processes Strengthening (CEPP S) program, which ran from 2010 -
2017, with the goal of “ strengthening the development of more democratic and open political processes 
and the participation of candidates, activists, monitors, and voters in elections.”  
A 2018- 2019 evaluation found that CEP PS and its successor contributed to the stated goal and that the 
IEC was more capable of election administration. However, the evaluation recommended continuing support to electoral governance in Jordan, specifically in the areas of political party develop ment, greater 
civil society engagement and increasing engagement by women, youth and persons with disabilities. The 
evaluation also recommended the adoption of a more collaborative approach with parliament.  
RULE OF LAW  
LEGAL FRAMEWORK  
The Jordanian legal framework does not delineate clear relationships between the executive, legislative 
and judiciary branches. Power is concentrated within the role of the King, who can unilaterally dissolve 
parliament and has strong influence over the appointment of judges at all levels. The Kingdom has four 
main types of courts: constitutional, civil, religious and special courts that rule on issues related to the 
military and security. The King may unilaterally appoint the members of the Constitutional Court and 
the chair of the Judicial Council, an institution composed primarily of senior judiciary members that 
nominates judges for the civil court system (Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2018).  
The Jordanian civil court system hears all civil and criminal matters that do not fall un der either religious 
or special courts. It is composed of a hierarchy of courts hearing matters of increasing significance, as 
well as courts of appeal. The religious courts in Jordan have jurisdiction solely over personal matters. These include areas of f amily law such as marriage or divorce, child custody, adoption, and inheritance 12  |  USAID/JORDAN  USAID.GOV  matters. While there are courts for different religious groups, the primary religious courts are Sharia 
(Islamic law) courts —which handle personal status matters for Muslims.  Judges of both the civil and 
Sharia courts are formally appointed by royal decree (Freedom House, 2018a).  
The Jordanian civil legal framework does not apply protections equitably across all citizens. Specifically, women are disadvantaged in several respect s. In family law, it is more “difficult for women to acquire 
custody of children in the event of a divorce, and the law does not recognize marriages between Muslim women and non -Muslim men, although such unions between Muslim men and non- Muslim women are 
recognized” (Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2018:13) Women are also disadvantaged in property rights and do 
not have equal access to property under Sharia- based inheritance rules (Freedom House, 2018a).   
Likewise, Jordan’s large non -citizen population, which includ es approximately 350,000 children of 
Jordanian mothers, do not receive equal protection under the law. Non -citizens face restricted rights to 
work, own property, travel from and return to Jordan (where many were born and live), access public 
education and health care, and acquire a driver’s license (Human Rights Watch, 2018). This issue is most 
prominent for the children of non- Jordanian Palestinian fathers that have lived in the country for 
decades.  
In the criminal system, authorities have broad discretio n in the use of pre -trial detention. Governors are 
empowered to impose administrative detention for a period of up to one year and police may hold 
suspects without charge for up to six months. While changes to the law enacted in 2017 were intended 
to limit  the use of these measures, in practice they remain common. Individuals continue to be held for 
lengthy periods prior to trial, and the non- legal application of force (including torture) by police and 
security forces continues without accountability. Priso n conditions are generally poor, and inmates 
reportedly suffer from beatings and other abuse by guards (Freedom House, 2018a). Overall, public 
trust in the legal system is weak, with the Arab Transformations Project registering a trust rating of 
44.7% (Ber telsmann Stiftung, 2018).  
OPEN GOVERNMENT  
There is relatively little transparency in governance. The laws regarding public access to information are 
vague, do not provide procedural guidance and contain many exceptions to disclosure (OECD, 2017; 
Freedom House, 2018a). In general, there are few req uirements for proactive disclosures by 
government and few avenues for the public to request and receive information.  
Although the constitution guarantees freedom of speech and expression, media laws in fact are applied 
restrictively (and arbitrarily) both  to censor publication of unfavorable views and to promote self-
censorship (Freedom House, 2016). Various laws penalize criticism of the royal family or state 
institutions or actions that harm Jordan’s foreign relations and attempts to loosen the restricti ons posed 
by these laws have met with resistance. For instance, a 2014 law was passed to limit the ability of the quasi-military State Security Court to try citizens and journalists for crimes related to freedom of 
expression.  Amendments to the anti -terro rism laws later in the year, however, loosened the definition 
of terrorism and restored the ability of State Security Court to prosecute journalists for acts that “threaten the country’s relations to foreign states or expose the country or its citizens to retaliatory 
acts on them or their money” (Freedom House, 2018b). In a similar scenario, while the Press and 
Publication Law prohibits jailing journalists for press offenses, the 2015 Cybercrime Law allows 
journalists to be imprisoned if offending print art icles appear online, thereby rendering the immunity of 
journalists irrelevant with respect to the primary means of dissemination (Freedom House, 2018b).  USAID.GOV   STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS |  13 These restrictions are not merely theoretical, although to date the purpose of the restrictions seems t o 
be to instill a chilling effect on the press. In 2015, a number of Jordanian journalists were arrested for 
their coverage of the Syrian conflict and the Islamic State militant group. Although most of these 
journalists were released after brief detentions , subsequent surveys of the press indicate that most 
journalists (upwards of 90%) practice self -censorship when reporting on topics such as the royal court, 
the armed forces, the judicial system and religious issues (Freedom House, 2018b).  
SECTOR STRATEGI C ISSUES  
• The legal framework does not apply equal rights to women or to Jordan’s large populations of 
non-citizens in critical areas of property, access to public services and the right to work.  
• The police and authorities maintain broad discretion to hold imprison individuals for longer 
periods of time without charge. This is compounded by the lack of accountability of the police 
and security forces for the use of torture and mistreatment.  
• The legal framework provides minimal protections for the press, and the arbitrary application of 
statutory authority to censure the press further limits the already minimal transparency of 
governing authority.   
USAID PORTFOLIO HIGH LIGHTS  
The USAID Rule of Law and Public Accountability Strengthening (ROLPAS) activity (2015- 2020) 
strengthens democratic accountability and effective rule of law through improved institutions, systems 
and processes and increased civic and private sector participation. Specifically, ROLPAS focuses on enhancing judicial independence and effectiveness, strengthening GOJ accountability and transparency, 
and increasing public demand for accountability, transparency, rule of law, and protection of human 
rights.  
GOVERNMENT CAPACITY AND PUBLIC ADMINISTR ATION  
Jordan is a highly centralized, unitary state with two levels of sub -national government – governorates 
and municipalities. The central government provides most basic services, including water, electricity, gas, 
sewerage, primary education and healthcare. These are provided through line ministry directorates at 
the governorate level (OECD, 2017). Governorates and municipalities, by contrast, play a very limited 
role in providing public services, have few financial resources and little political power (OECD, 2017).  However, this may be changing with th e approval of the 2015 Decentralization Law and Municipality 
Law.  
There are several Jordanian government institutions responsible for the management and oversight of the public sector at the central level. The Department of Institutional Performance Devel opment and 
Policies under the administrative system of the Prime Minister is responsible for coordinating the Jordanian government strategy on and management of the public sector. It replaces the Ministry of Public Sector Development, which was abolished in late 2018. Jordan’s Civil Service Bureau is entrusted 
with applying laws and rules pertaining to civil service recruitment and selection, developing processes 
for such functions, and collecting statistics to build databases for human resources management  (Jreisat, 
2018).  14  |  USAID/JORDAN  USAID.GOV  Government administrative capacity is relatively low at all levels of government, especially when viewed 
in terms of the government’s effectiveness in delivering services to the public. One contributing factor 
to low government capacity is the tremendous growth of the Jordanian population.  According to 
World Bank data, the population of Jordan in 2000 was 5.1 million people. Today, the population is over 
9.7 million, and a significant proportion of this population consists of refugees fr om the region (World 
Bank, 2019a). This dramatic increase in population has understandably strained the delivery of public 
services (OECD, 2017).  
Another factor may be the roles of nepotism and patronage in civil service staffing. This issue was 
prominent in 2016, as correspondence between the Prime Minister and the Speaker of Parliament 
discussing the appointment of parliamentary staff became public. An ensuing investigation by the Jordan 
Times  demonstrated that many of the individuals staffing parliament were either sons or other relatives 
of parliamentary members (Jreisat, 2018). The problems of nepotism and patronage are believed to be widespread across government. This both negatively impacts public confidence in the civil service and 
“inhibits the deve lopment of needed knowledge and skills among public employees to build institutional 
capacity” (Jreisat, 2018: 88).  
Finally, the Jordanian civil service lacks technical and managerial skills, especially with respect to planning 
and development processes, a nd especially at the sub -national level. This may be a function of the highly 
centralized nature of decision -making, which places relatively little emphasis on the development of 
institutional processes and roles. “Management fails because what needs to be  done, by whom, and at 
what cost are not defined” (Jreisat, 2018:  787). 
SECTOR STRATEGIC ISS UES 
• The adoption of the 2015 Decentralization Law and the Municipality Law (discussed in the Local 
Governance section below) vest Governorates and Municipalities with additional responsibilities 
for which institutional capacity has not been developed. Challenges will include defining 
responsibilities and developing managerial and technical competence (OECD, 2017).  
• USAID’s recent CITIES (Cities Implem enting Transparent, Innovative & Effective Solutions) 
Evaluation Baseline Study found that local councils have no resources and are generally unclear 
about their role in local governance, while governorate councils are still determining their roles 
vis-à-vis municipalities and central ministries. In addition, a rapid assessment of CITIES 
conducted in early 2019 found that while the project is generally in a positive position to further support effective decentralization the GOJ policy agenda for decentraliz ation is unclear and 
subject to change. This uncertainty poses a risk for continued support to decentralization.  
• The recent scandals involving nepotism and patronage reflect the lack of transparency in civil service recruitment and hiring. The lack of meri t-based hiring and appointment will continue to 
limit administrative effectiveness and professionalism. 
LOCAL GOVERNANCE  
Each of Jordan’s twelve governorates is headed by a governor appointed by the King and responsible to 
the Ministry of Interior. Each go vernorate contains Directorates that are extensions of the country’s line 
ministries. While there have been some movements towards making the governorates more responsive to the needs of local populace, the system remains highly centralized –  politically, administratively and 
financially.  USAID.GOV   STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS |  15 There are over 100 municipalities with distinct legal authority and some measure of autonomy, having 
the right to levy and collect a limited range of local taxes and fees. These municipalities are supervised 
by the Minist ry of Municipal Affairs. Municipalities hold regular elections and the majority of local 
councils are democratically elected. With the exception of Amman, the mayors of these municipalities 
are also elected. Municipalities are, for the most part, instituti onally weak, and many responsibilities 
remain vested in centrally- controlled agencies (World Bank, 2017). While recent changes in the law 
have increased the autonomy of municipal governments, they remain highly reliant on central 
government for fiscal tran sfers to support their operations – overall, only about 22% of total revenue is 
collected by the municipality itself (OECD, 2017).  
In 2015, the government passed two major laws intended to provide greater autonomy and authority to 
local governments. The 2 015 Decentralization Law created new institutions within the governorate, 
including an executive council and a governorate council, the latter of which is substantially popularly elected, and which is supposed to provide greater levels of legislative overs ight over executive functions. 
The Decentralization Law also expanded the role of the Local Development Units (LDUs), which were established in 2002 to promote socio -economic development in the municipalities and governorates 
across the country. LDUs are n ow responsible to develop proposals based upon the needs of their 
constituents following consultation with local stakeholders, such as Civil Society Organizations ( CSO)s 
and non- governmental groups (OECD, 2017).  
The 2015 Decentralization Law represents a s tep in Jordan’s gradual devolution of power. However, the 
results of these laws to date has been greater scope for advisory responsibilities of local entities, while 
political power remains vested centrally. For example, while there is greater scope for th e popular 
election of governorate officials, the executive council of each governorate – including the governor, 
deputy governor, district officials, and heads of each ministry’s local executive offices – are still 
appointed and answerable to the Ministry of Interior (Sowell, 2017a).  In addition, governorate 
institutions do not have authority to raise revenues, making them wholly dependent on the central 
government for resources.  
A similar dynamic is apparent with the 2015 Municipalities Law. The law allo ws for greater 
democratization through the election of municipal councils and mayors – except in Amman where the 
mayor continues to be appointed. “However, in the absence of political and financial autonomy, the role 
of municipalities remains limited. More over, previous experience suggests that there is a gap between 
the responsibilities assigned in the laws and the functions exercised in practice (i.e. delivery of public services)” (OECD, 2017:  9). Furthermore, there are also gaps within the legal framewor k related to the 
Decentralization and Municipalities Laws yet to be addressed by the GOJ.  
Enthusiasm for the devolution process, or at least the manner in which it is being conducted, appears to 
be muted. Turnout for the 2017 municipal elections was only 31.7% (IFES, 2019). Polling conducted after 
the election revealed that a significant majority of the population did not know the main purpose of 
decentralization and did not know that provincial and municipal councils were now democratically 
elected (Center  for Insights in Survey Research, 2017).  
SECTOR STRATEGIC ISS UES 
• Despite recent steps to devolve authority, Jordan remains highly centralized. Local government 
units continue to be primarily answerable to central government, both because of the continuing 
hold on political authority by central actors and because all (in  the case of governorates) or 16  |  USAID/JORDAN  USAID.GOV  most (in the case of municipalities) resources available to local governments derive from the 
center.  
• Provincial and municipal governments have limited capacity, which will hinder the greater 
devolution of power and responsibility to these institutions.  
• The Jordanian public largely does not understand the purpose of the devolution process, the 
scope for popular election of subnational government officials or the authorities granted to 
provincial and municipal actors.  
USAID PO RTFOLIO HIGHLIGHTS  
The USAID CITIES project aims to increase the effectiveness of municipal governance and support 
decentralization in Jordan through four sub- goals: improved service delivery, increased sustainability of 
municipal and decentralized governm ent operations, increased responsiveness to citizen priorities and 
enhanced capacity to promote community cohesion and resilience. USAID’s recent CITIES  impact 
evaluation  baseline study (March 2019) found that: (a) Municipalities suffer from significant st ructural 
burdens that impair the provision of quality services to citizens; (b) More time will be needed to 
determine the sustainability of specific CITIES interventions, but a number of risks to sustainability are 
evident; and (c) There has been some init ial coordination between CITIES and other donor activities, 
but there are salient gaps to overcome in overall donor coordination and synergy.  
ANTI -CORRUPTION  
Corruption continues to have a significant negative effect on perceptions of the public sector by Jordanians and on views of Jordan as a destination of foreign direct investment. In a recent public 
opinion poll, corruption was cited as the fifth biggest problem facing Jordan today (Center for Insights in Survey Research, 2018). However, recent reforms to improve the legal framework for combating 
corruption, combined with a relatively high number of ongoing corruption cases by new institutions, 
suggests an earnest attempt to combat corruption within the Kingdom.  
Corruption in Jordan manifests itself in many ways. The most common form of corruption faced by most Jordanians is the practice known as wasta , or the use of connections to advance professional and 
business interests. This continues to be seen as part of doing business for many Jordanians. In a r ecent 
poll, 49% of respondents stated that they viewed this practice as either “fully acceptable” or “somewhat acceptable” (Center for Insights in Survey Research, 2018). However, the recent high -profile scandal 
involving parliamentary jobs being given to the close relatives of parliamentarians suggests that the practice is increasingly (or at least widely in this context) seen to be illegitimate (Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2018).  
There is also evidence of significant corruption in the awarding of public contra cts, where surveys 
identify competitive disadvantages in the procurement process, including inconsistencies in the application of award criteria on bidders, disregard of procedures for  changing  tender documents during 
the tender, and unsatisfactory respons es to inquiries regarding tenders (SIGMA 2016). There also exists 
a perception by the public of encountering corruption (e.g. bribery) when dealing with the police, the 
judiciary and the tax authorities (U.S. Department of State, 2018).  
While the Jordanian  Anti-Corruption Commission was established in 2004, it has not been a highly 
effective institution for most of its existence. The prosecution of corruption by the Commission was 
sporadic and arbitrary and has not led to confidence among the public (Bertel smann Stiftung, 2018). In 
2016, Prime Minister al -Mulki announced a new anti -corruption initiative, “The National Strategy for USAID.GOV   STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS |  17 Integrity and Anti -Corruption 2017- 2025.” As part of this initiative, the government merged the Anti -
Corruption Commission with t he Audit Bureau to form the Jordan Integrity and Anti -Corruption 
Commission (JIACC). The JIACC is now the main body responsible for combating corruption, although 
the Anti -Money Laundering Unit is responsible for combating money laundering. In addition, the 
Ombudsman Bureau continues to receive and investigate public complaints about corruption and 
misconduct by public officials (Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2018).  
The progress of the JIACC in prosecuting corruption is not clear at this time, but there are promisi ng 
developments. The JIACC took on 30 ongoing cases of alleged corruption from the Anti -Corruption 
Commission, and there appears to be an increase in the number of investigations by the institution. In 
addition, several high -ranking government officials have recently been indicted for corruption. The 
former Water and Irrigation Minister and the former Director of Customs, among other officials, have 
recently been indicted for bribery and abuse of power as part of a cigarette smuggling enterprise 
(Associated  Press, 2019). While these developments are welcome, the successful prosecution of high -
ranking officials remains rare and “some local observers questioned the JIACC’s effectiveness due to its 
limited jurisdiction, insufficient staff [and] legal obstacles”  (U.S. Department of State, 2018).  
SECTOR STRATEGIC ISS UES 
• Public attitudes towards some forms of corruption are lax. Specifically, the practice of using 
personal and familial connections as a means of obtaining jobs and contracts is seen as legitimate 
by roughly half of the population.  
• The recent emphasis on combating corruption espoused by the King and high government 
officials will need to be matched by an additional commitment in terms of staff and resources for 
the main anti -corruption institutions.  
• The restrictions on the free exercise of the press, including strict defamation laws, continue to 
hinder investigative journalism – one of the main avenues through which public corruption could 
be brought to light.  
CIVIL SOCIETY  
Civil society  in Jordan has expanded dramatically during the last decade, and especially since the 
enactment of the 2008 Law on Societies, which limited government engagement in organizational affairs 
and loosened restrictions on CSO activities. Over the last decade, t he number of officially registered 
CSOs has more than tripled from approximately 1,500 in 2008 to over 5,100 by 2016 (USAID, 2016a; INCL, 2019). While the legal regulatory framework has improved, there remain structural obstacles to 
the operations of CSOs that are compounded by organizational weaknesses within the CSO community.  
The 2008 Law on Societies, as amended, simplified registration procedures for civil society, many of 
which are focused on charitable and aid activities. However, bureaucratic obstacles remain that limit the 
activities of independent CSOs – although Royal NGOs and Government NGOs benefit from the 
financial support and operational freedom granted by the authorities (OECD, 2017).  
There are several significant restrictions faced by CSOs , including: 
• CSOs are prohibited from receiving foreign funding absent the approval of the Ministry of Social 
Development, which also has broad powers to supervise CSO operations and activities. These 18  |  USAID/JORDAN  USAID.GOV  powers are not exercised transparently and, in 2017, the Ministry denied funding requests and 
issued warnings to dozens of CSOs (INCL, 2019).  
• The Law on Societies prohibits CSOs from engaging in political activities, although the law does 
not provide a definition of “political.”  Such vague terminology invites  government discretion and 
potentially subjects societies to a chilling effect in their expressive activity (INCL, 2019).   
• In April 2017, the Council of Ministers stated that the Anti -Money Laundering Law and 
Counter -Terrorism Financing Law of 2007 would a pply to NGOs, thus requiring them to verify 
information about their “customers” –  a vague term in this context which could apply to funders 
or beneficiaries. While concerns about the influence of terrorist organizations are not 
unreasonable, the lack of cl arity on the application of the law poses a potentially chilling effect 
on CSOs (Freedom House, 2018b).  
• Jordanian law makes it a criminal offense to make defamatory or libelous expressions –  which 
the Penal Code defines as “attaching false accusations to a person or treating a person 
disrespectfully through speech, writing, drawings, and other forms of communication.” 
Defamation or libel of government officials carries more severe penalties, ranging from two 
weeks to three years of imprisonment. “Under Jord an’s Cybercrimes Law, amended in 2018, 
these offenses along with ‘hate speech,’ if conveyed online, are subject to even steeper penalties than under the Penal Code.” These consequences likewise pose a chilling effect on CSOs (INCL, 
2019).  
In addition to the structural challenges faced by CSOs in Jordan, the reliance by independent CSOs on 
donor funding has created an incentive structure that has limited the development of these 
organizations. The 2016 USAID Civil Society Assessment found that “civil society  remains donor -driven 
and donor -dependent. Most CSOs are established first and foremost to access donor funding. As a 
result, they lack a clear mission and an organic connection to the communities or constituencies they 
claim to serve. Instead, they react to the priorities of donors and thus tend to be project - or activity-
driven” (USAID, 2016b:  7).  
CSOs also have limited organizational capacity, especially in the areas of strategic planning, advocacy and 
fundraising (outside the strict confines of donor grant funding). The Civil Society Assessment found that 
CSOs lack the capacity to effectively conceptualize programmatic responses to the needs and issues they identify as well as the ability to implement projects. The advocacy component of civil society 
remains underdeveloped with CSOs insufficiently specialized and working on a vast array of activiti es. 
(USAID, 2016b). A critical requirement for the development of a robust civil society will be orienting 
CSOs towards domestic constituencies and building their domestic legitimacy.  
SECTOR STRATEGIC ISS UES 
• The legal and regulatory framework for CSOs in Jordan lacks clarity, which potentially subjects 
CSOs to penalties for a variety of potentially legitimate activity and has a chilling effect that hinders their representation of domestic constituencies.  
• CSOs remain oriented towards the priorities of western donors who are their primary funders. 
The sustainability of these organizations will require the development of a domestic 
constituency and funding base.  USAID.GOV   STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS |  19 • CSOs have relatively weak organizational capab ilities and tend to be project -focused. Additional 
capacity will need to be developed in strategic planning and advocacy if CSOs are expected to 
advance the interests of Jordanian communities.  
USAID PORTFOLIO HIGH LIGHTS  
From 2013 to 2018, USAID funded the  Civic Initiatives Support Program (CIS), which sought to 
contribute to stronger civil society organizations working across the sectors of democracy, human rights 
and governance, economic development, education, energy, environment, health, and/or water.  
“Working at both national and local levels, it supported civic initiatives and advocacy responding to 
common interests; strengthened the organizational capacity of civil society organizations; and promoted 
Government of Jordan -civil society collaboration e fforts to address reform and development challenges” 
(USAID, 2017b).  
The mid -term evaluation of CIS found that while the project did build knowledge of key functions of a 
broad range of organizations, working more intensively with a smaller number of high -potential 
organizations could yield significant benefits to developing institutional capacity of these organizations 
(USAID, 2016a).  
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT  AND ENERGY  
Jordan was classified as an upper -middle -income country until 2017, when it was reclassifi ed as lower -
middle income. During most of the 2000s, the country experienced solid growth varying between 4% 
and 8% per year. However, starting in 2010 and continuing through the present, growth rates have 
declined to between 2% and 3% per year, in part be cause of the spillover effects of the conflicts in Syria  
and Iraq (See Figure 1).  
FIGURE 1: GDP GROWTH  RATES BY YEAR  
 
The government has set achieving economic growth as a key priority of its Jordan Economic Growth Plan (JEGP) 2018 - 2022, the road map for  how the government will accomplish a 5% growth rate by 
2022. The GOJ identifies five overarching objectives that will contribute to increased economic growth: 
maintaining macroeconomic stability, increasing competitiveness, develop key economic sectors, s ocial 
development and improvements in gender equity and empowerment. The first of these three objectives 
20  |  USAID/JORDAN  USAID.GOV  and the issue of gender empowerment arise in the discussion of key USAID economic themes addressed 
below.  
BUSINESS ENABLING EN VIRONMENT  
Many of Jordan ’s economic challenges, from trade imbalances to high unemployment, are associated with 
the limited growth experienced by Jordanian businesses. It is for this reason that the government 
highlighted improvements in the business enabling environment as a pri ority for 2019- 2020 (Jreisat, 
2018).  
Overall, the business enabling environment in Jordan is about average for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, as least as measured by metrics such as the World Bank Doing Business  
Indicators. Jordan’s overal l rank among countries in the Doing Business 2019  report was 104 out of 190, 
while the average rank for the region is 112. However, the average rank for the region is depressed by three countries currently suffering conflicts: Yemen (187), Libya (186) and Syria (179).  When judged 
against the rest of the region, Jordan ranks below the country average of 99 (World Bank, 2019c).  
While there are several features of the business environment that are regularly cited in the literature as 
impediments to business g rowth and entrepreneurship, one factor is cited above all: the availability of 
credit for medium and small enterprises. According to the Doing Business  report, Jordan ranks 134th in 
the world in the ease of obtaining credit, against a regional average of 1 26 (including Yemen, Libya and 
Syria) (World Bank, 2019b). The challenge relates primarily to the Jordanian banking sector, which 
engages in very conservative lending practices. There exists within the banking sector a perception that 
lending to small and medium size business is overly risky, and financial products are tailored to large 
businesses and the government (USAID, 2018b). While most Jordanian businesses hold checking and 
savings accounts through financial institutions, few obtain credit through ba nks, preferring instead to 
borrow informally on the basis of personal and family connections (IMF, 2017).  
Another area cited in the Doing Business  report but not reflected in other studies relates to the relatively 
little authority and few protections prov ided to minority investors of Jordanian businesses (World Bank, 
2019b). Minority investors in Jordan are generally not afforded the ability to review internal documents 
from the company, given the opportunity to vote on corporate actions or given say over the 
appointment and retention of external auditors. The lack of protections for minority investors deters 
opportunities for capital investment and finance, which is more of a concern in Jordan where bank 
financing is limited (Jordan Strategy Forum, 2017).  
A final factor that constrains business growth and entrepreneurship, but which is consistent with the 
standards of the region, involves the burdensome regulatory regime. The perception that regulatory compliance will be cumbersome, the bureaucracy is inefficient and that taxes are high deters Jordanians 
from opening businesses and formalizing informal business (USAID, 2018b).  
SECTOR STRATEGIC ISS UES 
• The relatively low- risk option of lending to government and large businesses provides few 
incentives for Jord anian banks to extend credit to small and medium enterprises and 
entrepreneurs, which hinders economic growth. Further regulation in the areas of bankruptcy 
and collateral could be considered to improve credit access.  USAID.GOV   STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS |  21 • The corporate and securities laws governing the rights of minority shareholders afford minimal 
protections and do not incentivize greater direct investment in Jordan businesses, which is 
especially problematic in light of the minimal options for bank lending.  
• Streamlining and automating regulatory and bureaucratic processes would make the business 
environment more efficient and could promote greater formalization of business in the country.  
USAID PORTFOLIO HIGH LIGHTS  
The USAID Economic Development and Ene rgy Office operates across several workstreams, one of 
which is dedicated to improving the climate of doing business in Jordan. A recent assessment of USAID 
Jordan’s Economic Growth portfolio found that USAID programs were successful in improving the 
business enabling environment in Jordan, especially in streamlining and automating regulatory 
requirements. The assessment also found that “to increase competitiveness and incentivize investment, 
it is necessary to continue to streamline procedures key to doing  business in Jordan (registration, 
patents, licensing etc.),”  but that USAID should “combine efforts to persuade government through 
compelling analysis at the policy technician levels with public awareness efforts at the grassroots level to 
cultivate deman d for reforms among stakeholders” (USAID, 2018b: 80). 
MICRO, SMALL, AND ME DIUM ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT  
While the exact number or percentage of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) that operate in 
Jordan is not clear, the percentage of private sector companies that fall into the category is likely above 90%. These include both formal registered businesses and informal businesses, which are not registered 
and do not pay taxes (Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2018). Although the informal business sector is large, there 
is no clear understanding of its size and it is likely evolving in nature with the dramatic and recent 
increase in the Syrian refugee population in Jordan. “The International Labor Organization estimates that 
as many as 160,000 Syrian workers are wor king illegally in the informal sector, especially in the areas of 
construction, service (including hospitality) and agriculture” (Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2018:  19). 
By virtue of its size, the MSME category of business is the main driver of Jordan’s private s ector 
economy and provides the greatest opportunities for economic and job growth in the future. Irrespective of their importance to the overall economy, MSMEs operate in a challenging environment; based upon a 2010 study by the OECD, over 90% of SMEs coll apse within their first five years (Mashal, 
2018). According to the USAID/Jordan Private Sector Survey, over half of registered  medium and small 
enterprises  (MSEs ) are in poor financial health (USAID 2018b ), several factors contribute to their 
relatively poor performance.   
From data collected by USAID IPs in the last five years, cash flow and inadequate revenues are seen by MSEs as the major driving factors of poor performance. According to the USAID LENS 2017 MSE survey, 57% of MSEs have monthly revenues of 500 JOD or less per month. This is just a few JOD 
higher than the average salary for working men in Jordan. According to both the private sector survey 
and the USAID MESP General Population Survey stagn ant or decreasing sales and lack of access to 
markets are the top challenges to growth and performance reported by MSEs owners (both male and 
female).  
Additionally, there does not appear to be a culture of or capacity for innovation (technological or 
managerial) or risk -taking amongst Jordanian MSMEs. According to the 2016 World Bank Country 
Diagnostic:  22  |  USAID/JORDAN  USAID.GOV  • Only 13% of service sector companies and 19% of manufacturing companies use technology 
transfers from other firms or parent firms as a source of support for  innovation activities;  
• Only 16% of firms had made any innovations to logistics and distribution methods and barely 
10% introduced new organizational structures or management practices;  
• Over 75% of firms surveyed indicated that during the previous three ye ars they had introduced 
neither a new product nor service or a new or significantly improved method of manufacturing 
products or services (World Bank, 2016).  
As the World Bank study noted: “there is a need for a broader, more private sector- focused product  
and process development strategy instead of the earlier near -exclusive focalization on science and 
technology. Focus on innovation is key to improve productivity in both knowledge -intensive and labor -
intensive sectors” (World Bank, 2016: 41). 
As noted abo ve, utilization of credit is also a major challenge faced by MSMEs. There is growing interest 
by traditional financial institutions in MSME lending, but few financial products tailored to the needs of 
MSMEs. MSMEs have limited information about financing o ptions and there is marginal financial literacy 
amongst the potential consumers of financial products. “Although banks are the principal source of 
external finance for SMEs, only 11% of bank lending goes to SMEs, compared to 25- 40% in emerging 
markets” (Wo rld Bank, 2016 : 42).  In recent years, the microfinance industry has made efforts to 
expand in Jordan to try to fill this gap in credit; however, the MFI sector is not able to completely fill the 
gap. In addition to a lack of financial products tailored to  MSMEs, cultural attitudes toward finance and 
credit remain a challenge to increasing MSME utilization finance. Cultural and religious norms around 
interest and loans are factors that contribute to a lack of demand and utilization of loan products 
(USAID, 2018d). The most common sources of finance for small business continue to be family and 
friends or private informal lenders (IMF, 2017).  
Women face additional obstacles in entrepreneurship but also provide a potential opportunity to tap latent talent and enthusiasm. While surveys of women business owners in the region show high interest 
in entrepreneurship and business expansion, women’s access to financial services has generally lagged 
men. A special focus may be required to overcome cultural and contextual constraints faced by women, 
including a lack of community and family support as well as gaps in general and financial management 
training and inaccessible credit markets (IMF, 2017).  
SECTOR STRATEGIC ISS UES 
• Jordanian MSMEs do not innovate to generate better products or more efficient operations and 
may lack the managerial skills or experience to promote either technological or managerial innovation within their companies.  
• There is limited access to capital, as Jordanian financial institutions  offer few financial products 
tailored to the needs of MSMEs.  
• Weak access to markets drives low and stagnant revenues and impedes MSMEs growth at individual and sector levels.  USAID.GOV   STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS |  23 • Women entrepreneurs and business owners represent untapped potential for growth in the 
sector but face constraints that limit their access to new markets, opportunities for training and 
experience, and the availability of credit.  
USAID PORTFOLIO HIGH LIGHTS  
There are two USAID projects that specifically address MSME development: the Jo rdan Loan Guarantee 
Facility (JLGF) and the Local Enterprise Support Project (LENS). JLGF provides partial loan guarantees 
and technical assistance to mobilize bank financing for creditworthy but previously underserved SMEs. A 
recent evaluation of JLGF det ermined that 28% (of the maximum guarantee value of $250m) of this 
demand- driven credit facility was leveraged by SMEs and recommended that more targeted outreach to 
enterprises (especially outside of Amman) should be considered for future endeavors (USAID , 2016c).  
LENS encourages the long -term economic growth and development potential of underserved 
communities by combining local economic development efforts with private sector initiatives, including 
facilitation of financing targeted specifically to MSME s. The USAID Economic Growth and 
Competitiveness Assessment found promising initial results from the LENS market systems development approach. It recommended scaling the project with this approach to address inclusive 
growth at the local level. In addition , a 2019 assessment of LENS found that LENS’s approach was 
effective in taking the first step towards fostering long -term economic growth and development of 
underserved Jordanian communities through strengthening local SMEs and the value chains that suppor t 
them.  
In addition, USAID supports MSMEs through its sector -level support to the tourism industry. The 
USAID/Jordan Building Economic Sustainability through Tourism (BEST) project works with 
governmental, non -governmental, and private sector stakeholders to strengthen the country's tourism 
facilities and services, improve the management and promotion of tourism sites, boost marketing efforts 
and encourage tourism to secondary sites. Both the USAID Economic Growth and Competitiveness 
Assessment and the mid -term evaluation of the BEST activity found that these interventions were 
effective in stimulating growth in specific economic sectors, although this growth tended to be focused 
on specific organizational beneficiaries. Two lessons drawn from the implementa tion of these 
interventions are that a greater emphasis on supporting business clusters (as opposed to individual businesses) could yield wider results, and that limited access to credit by MSMEs is likely to be a growth 
constraint that affects the sustainability of USAID outcomes.  
EMPLOYMENT  
Jordan’s labor force participation was a relatively low 39.2% and its official unemployment rate was 
18.6% in 2018, although unofficial sources suggest that the unemployment rate is actually double this. 
There are appr oximately 1.4 million Jordanians in the workforce and roughly an equal number of non-
Jordanians, composed primarily of Syrian refugees, but also Egyptians, Bangladeshi and Chinese. Employment is not equally distributed among the Jordanian population. For J ordanians between the ages 
of 15 and 24, the official unemployment rate for Jordanians is about 30% (Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2018:  
19). Only 10% of Jordanian women have jobs, compared to 50% of Jordanian men that are employed. “These rates are very low even compared to other Arab countries, for which the average employment 
rates are 81 per cent for men and 27 per cent for women” (Razzaz, 2017).  24  |  USAID/JORDAN  USAID.GOV  The Jordanian economy is primarily service -based, and the primary sectors for employment of Jordanian 
nationals are professional services and wholesale/retail. In 2017, nearly 45.9% of Jordanians worked for 
the government (Department of Statistics, 2017). The primary sectors for employment of non -
Jordanians are accommodation/ food service, construction and agriculture. Most of these jobs require 
lower levels of education and are relatively poorly paid, which makes them unattractive to large portions 
of the highly -educated Jordanian population (USAID, 2018b). Nevertheless, there are roughly 100,000 
unemployed Jordanians w ho do not possess a secondary education and are in direct competition with 
the non -Jordanian workforce (Razzaz, 2017).  
Jordan’s economy has not succeeded in creating high -value jobs for its highly -educated populace. The 
sectors of the economy that have pro duced the most jobs –  tourism, construction, retail and textiles – 
are sectors where educational requirements and wages are low. These sectors are dominated by non -
Jordanians. The sectors that require higher levels of education, yield higher wages and are more 
attractive to Jordanians – telecom, non -textile manufacturing, ICT services -  produce few jobs (World 
Bank, 2016). As a result, each year Jordanian universities produce tens of thousands of new graduates 
for which jobs are not available, further incre asing the ranks of unemployed youth (Sowell, 2017b).  
The inability of the Jordanian private sector to produce jobs for Jordanians has self- perpetuating effects. 
Each year, a large number of the most highly educated Jordanians emigrate to work in Gulf Coope ration 
Council countries (GCC). The Ministry of Labor estimates that there are currently 425,000 Jordanians 
working in the Gulf countries (Razzaz, 2017). The loss of the most highly educated Jordanians removes a 
class of potential entrepreneurs and makes t he country less conducive to successful enterprise and its 
potential for job creation. Further, as Jordanian nationals leave the country and less highly- educated non -
Jordanians take positions in sectors such as tourism and construction, this further stereo types these 
positions as undesirable for Jordanians and removes pressure for increased pay and working conditions 
(Razzaz, 2017).  
Both the government and the donor community have implemented programs to provide workers with the skills needed by the private sector, but these have not been successful in stimulating large 
employment gains in high -value sectors. In part, this reflects a problem driven not by supply constraints, 
but by a lack of demand by employers – there are highly educated Jordanian yo uth leaving university 
each year. However, surveys also suggest that businesses are not aware that these programs exist and 
do not tap them to identify qualified applicants (USAID, 2018b).  
In addition, attitudinal and structural factors are constraints to more expanded employment. General 
uncertainty about the future status of markets in Jordan, combined with the widespread use of personal 
connections and nepotism in job -seeking, pose challenges to the efficiency and effectiveness of labor 
markets (USAID, 2 018d). Finally, while MSEs dominate the private sector they are found to have minimal 
effect on creating additional jobs (USAID, 2019).  
SECTOR STRATEGIC ISS UES 
• There is currently insufficient employment demand, which can likely only be addressed on a 
large-scale basis by increased private sector economic growth, or at the very least, increased 
business revenue (e.g., by tax cuts or credits). While the government’s National Strategy for 
Human Resources Development and National Employment Strategy look to add ress longer -
term structural issues, short - and medium - term efforts will be necessary to ameliorate the 
immediate challenges posed by unemployment.  USAID.GOV   STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS |  25 • The lack of participation by women in the workforce is likely a significant constraint to private 
sector gr owth that should continue to be addressed. “Currently, women’s economic 
empowerment is still mainly seen as a social problem rather than an economic opportunity” 
(USAID, 2018b:  13-14). 
USAID PORTFOLIO HIGH LIGHTS  
The USAID Workforce Development Program (WFD) focused on six governorates within Jordan and 
sought to “create a competitive, demand -driven workforce development system that leads to increased 
private sector employment.” WFD worked to achieve this by enhancing technical and vocational 
training, improving labor market information systems, and facilitating increased employment for women, 
youth and the especially vulnerable. The USAID/Jordan Economic Growth and Competitiveness Assessment (USAID, 2018b) found that WFD produced mixed results. The program was effective in 
addressing some supply -side constraints, but the major factors limiting job creation were found to be 
demand- side. Another major challenge was matching supply to demand. For WFD there was a flawed  
assumption that the beneficiaries being trained for the jobs would take the specific types of jobs offered 
to them at the end of the training program. In many cases, trained beneficiaries did not take the jobs 
available, either because the women could not  receive family approval for the employment, or because 
the jobs were considered less respectable than being unemployed.   
All USAID economic growth activities, while not solely focused on employment like WFD, had major 
components focused on employment. The Economic Growth and Competitiveness Assessment found 
that all USAID activities struggled in meeting employment -related performance targets. The assessment 
recommended that future supply -side interventions be accompanied by commitments for job placement 
required of business beneficiaries.  
INVESTMENT, TRADE AN D EXPORTS  
Jordan is a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and recently ratified the WTO Trade 
Facilitation Agreement (TFA), which commits it to implementing measures for expediting the movemen t, release, and clearance of goods. In 2016, Jordan also signed the Jordan Compact with the 
European Union (EU), which gave preferential treatment to Jordanian goods in exchange for the Kingdom’s commitment to improving access to education and legal employment for its Syrian refugees 
(USAID, 2018b).  
Jordan maintains significant trade relationships with a number of countries, and its main regional trading 
partners are located in the MENA region, Europe, East Asia and North America. Its main import 
partners a re in MENA and Europe while it exports primarily within MENA and to the United States. In 
2017, Jordan carried a trade deficit of nearly $11.5 billion that was driven by a merchandise deficit of 
$12.9 billion. Jordan held  a trade surplus in services of app roximately $1.5 billion (United Nations, 
2019a). Overall, Jordan has maintained a large trade deficit since roughly the beginning of the Syrian 
crisis, which was exacerbated by the conflict in Iraq. These conflicts both affected major trading partners 
directly, but also closed major regional export routes (IMF, 2017). Along with the reduction in exports, 
there has also been a decrease in direct foreign investment, which has stagnated between $1.5 billion 
and $2.1billion since 2010.  
Jordan’s current account  deficit over the last decade peaked in 2012 and has improved recently, 
including modest improvements from 2017 to 2018. This result stemmed from a mix of declining non-26  |  USAID/JORDAN  USAID.GOV  energy imports and robust growth in service exports, including travel. However, the ina bility to expand 
the export base and make dramatic improvements to the current account deficit rest, in turn, on an 
inability to direct resources to Jordan’s high -productivity traded sectors. While Jordan’s high human 
capital, natural geography and favorab le trading relationships suggest promise for commercial sectors 
such as ICT, pharmaceutics, health services and renewable energy, the failure to direct appropriate 
investment and resources to these sectors has made it difficult to scale growth (World Bank,  2016).  
Jordan does not have a wide export base. From 2015- 2017, its major commodity exports were textiles, 
mineral and chemical fertilizers, pharmaceuticals and natural calcium phosphates. Its major service exports were travel (i.e., tourism) and transpor tation. “The direct contribution of travel and tourism to 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Jordan in 2016 was US$ 1,929 million (JOD 1,370 million) 
contributing 4.9% of the Kingdom’s GDP and a vital source of foreign exchange” (USAID, 2018b: 2). 
More recent  satellite account statistics report the contribution of tourism at 6% of GDP. In terms of 
imports, primary import commodities were motor vehicles and petroleum products (United Nations, 
2019a). This list of Jordan’s imports is indicative of its “lack of p articipation in global value chains other 
than for pharmaceuticals” (World Bank, 2016 : 9). 
Jordan is taking major strides to cultivate a favorable investment climate for the private sector and has 
made it a priority to remove barriers and east the entry fo r investments to promote economic growth. 
It is a member of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and all investment projects are income and social service partially tax -exempt for a ten- year period, with the level of exemption 
dependent on sector (Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2018). In addition, there are no restrictions on the ability of 
investors to repatriate capital and project profits (Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2018).  
SECTOR STRATEGIC ISS UES 
• Regional conflicts and its instability have depressed J ordan’s export sector, both because of 
dislocation of export relationships and trade traditional routes. It is not clear the extent to 
which exports will return to non -conflict levels once the conflicts have ceased.  
• Export Diversification continues to be a  key issue facing Jordanian products and services, and its 
ability to be resilient to the challenges of the region.  
• Utilization of trade agreements, particularly in the services sector in accessing markets such as the U.S. and the EU  
• National Investment pipeline maturity and having significant bankable deals to attract investment to finance from local, regional and foreign investors.  
• Big investors existing from Jordan, with no structured “investors exit interviews” to better 
understand and enhance investor s’ confidence, to avoid such exits in the future.  
• Prior to the current period of regional instability, Jordan’s economy benefited as a source of 
investment for the GCC. However, this investment has slackened since 2010 and stabilized at 
lower levels of in vestment. Jordan has thus far failed to compensate by attracting foreign 
investment from outside the region or by allocating domestic resources more efficiently to its 
higher potential economic sectors.  USAID.GOV   STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS |  27 USAID PORTFOLIO HIGH LIGHTS  
The Jordan Competitiveness Project (JCP) is USAID/Jordan’s primary activity focused increasing exports 
and promoting investment. JCP works with the Jordanian Ministry of Planning and International 
Cooperation (MOPIC), the Ministry of Industry, Trade, and S upply (MoITS), the Jordan Investment 
Commission (JIC) and other stakeholders to remove investment barriers and increase export 
opportunities for Jordanian industry. Since 2014, JCP worked with the JIC to develop regulations for the 
Investment Law, provided  sector -level support to expand export markets in East Africa and Central Asia 
and provided firm -specific support to Jordanian manufacturers to access markets made accessible 
through the Jordan Compact. A 2019 assessment of JCP found that the pairing of se ctor level (i.e., 
cluster) support earlier in the project and firm -level assistance later in the project contributed to the 
sustainability of results, but that both cluster and firm -level support had only mixed success. Cluster -
level support did contribute  to improvements in the business enabling environment but was Amman -
focused and had limited success in establishing sector -wide good practices. Firm -level support prompted 
firms to focus to a greater extent on marketing but did not result in any new transa ctions and was 
criticized for not providing greater business -to-business matching support.  
The recent USAID/Jordan Economic Growth and Competitiveness Assessment noted reluctance and skepticism amongst Jordanian stakeholders on the prioritization of products for exports recommended 
by JCP and upon the focus of Europe, East Africa and Central Asia as emergent export markets. The 
assessment recommended USAID/Jordan support a consultation process to achieve consensus on these 
issues.  
PUBLIC FINANCIAL MAN AGEMENT  
Public finances are managed by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) through various departments. The central 
section of the MoF manages fiscal policy, including economic forecasting, fiscal policy, cash and debt 
management and financial reporting. The General Budget Department of the MoF is responsible for the 
preparation and execution of the budget. The Income and Sales Tax Department and Customs 
Department are the primary institutions that manage tax policy and collection of taxes (Wiggins, 2017).  
Over 80% o f all government expenditure is undertaken through the central government and is managed, 
primarily, by these institutions (Wiggins, 2017). 
The fiscal priorities of the government are to achieve long- term reductions in the size of the debt and 
deficit, com plemented by increased domestic tax revenues. “Persistent fiscal deficits are generated from 
a relatively small tax base that needs to fund a large public sector, the costliest element of which is a 
large military (7.5% of GDP)” (World Bank, 2016 : 5). While the government has been successful 
recently in maintaining reasonable deficit -to-GDP ratios (for example, 3.4% of GDP in 2018), this masks 
underlying problems (World Bank, 2019a). Jordan continues to rely on large inflows of foreign aid to 
maintain its f iscal position. Without more than $1 billion in foreign aid, the deficit -to-GDP ratio would 
have been higher than 5%. The domestic budget increased significantly in both 2017 ($737 million) and 
2018 (forecast $600 million +), with increased spending on military, internal security forces, pensions, 
and interest on debt being main drivers (Sowell, 2018).  
One area in which the government has made significant achievements has been in tax policy and 
collection. In 2014, the government passed a series of economic  measures including a new Investment 
and Income Tax Law, which together simplified tax procedures while raising various fees and taxes. In 
part because of these changes, domestically generated revenues increased dramatically from 6.2 billion 28  |  USAID/JORDAN  USAID.GOV  Jordanian dina rs in 2016 to 6.9 billion in 2017, although revenues did not meet budget expectations for 
2018 (Sowell, 2018).  
At the end of 2018, the government amended the income tax law in an effort to increase revenues while 
bestowing preferential treatment on some ec onomic sectors. In addition to changing the tax liabilities of 
companies in specific sectors, the law established a new national contribution tax that will be levied 
upon the income of corporations and certain high- earning individuals in conjunction with i ncome taxes 
(Ernst & Young, 2019). “Because Jordan has historically been under -taxed, its rentier political model 
relying on foreign aid,” it has been able to nearly double domestic revenues in the span of a decade, 
although the non- fiscal economic impacts  of these tax changes may not be uniformly positive (Sowell, 
2018).  
With respect to the capacity of the MoF to manage economic policy, recent assessments suggest 
significant improvements have been made during the last decade, in part because of support fro m the 
United States, EU and other donors. A 2016 assessment of the Ministry’s capacity found a picture of 
“continuing gradual improvement.” “Financial management information systems have improved 
substantially, as has cash management and control. A commitm ent control module has been successfully 
introduced into GFMIS [the Government Financial Management Information System], and work is under 
way to rationalize internal control and further develop internal and external audit” (Wiggins, 2017:  12). 
However, th e assessment noted that further improvements could be made in tax collection and 
administration, internal controls and audits of government service delivery (Wiggins, 2017).  
SECTOR STRATEGIC ISS UES 
• Jordan faces significant macro -economic challenges resulti ng from factors outside of its control, 
including disruptions with its major trading partners and the influx of refugees from the Syrian 
refugees.  
• Jordan’s fiscal position is only sustainable in the medium -term with continued inflows of foreign 
assistance . The historically large public sector is supported by a relatively small tax base, but 
significant reductions to the size of the public sector and/or expansion of the tax base can only 
feasibly be undertaken gradually.  
USAID PORTFOLIO HIGHLIGHTS  
The USAI D-funded Jordan Fiscal Reform Project II (FRP II) and the Jordan Fiscal Reform Bridge Activity 
(JFRBA) have supported GOJ economic reform efforts by strengthening fiscal policy formulation, 
implementation, and public financial management. JFRBA’s technical  assistance focused on helping the 
GOJ improve performance in public spending and administration of public resources, enhancing 
accountability and transparency, increasing revenue generation through sound tax policies and tax 
administration, developing public private partnership capacity, and facilitating trade across borders.  
The USAID Fiscal Reform and Public Financial Management (FRPFM) is contributing to greater 
macroeconomic stability which leads to inclusive growth. The activity works to improve the G OJ’s 
institutional capability and policies, strengthen public -private dialogue on fiscal policy choices, and ensure 
that fiscal reforms are gender sensitive and more inclusive of vulnerable populations. The resulting increase in revenue generation and coll ection, improved budgeting, expenditure and debt management, 
and increased public investment in priority areas will drive economic growth and contribute to more 
broad -based development for Jordan.  USAID.GOV   STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS |  29 The experience of FRPFM is showing that progress on reforms  depends on the commitment, dedication 
and continuous support of GOJ and MoF leadership. Reforms must be homegrown, with buy -in at all 
levels. Furthermore, continuous changes in leadership with different management styles has had a 
negative impact on proje ct progress. In addition, the high workload of the current operational staff at 
MoF directorates hinders them from providing timely decisions and taking necessary action. A sustainable mechanism is needed to incentivize public employees to appreciate adapt ation and continue 
to perform their work efficiently. Finally, it is important for all stakeholders (e.g. USAID and MoF) to 
articulate in writing their roles and responsibilities in order to manage expectations and hold parties accountable for achieving an ticipated results.  
ENERGY RESOURCE MANA GEMENT  
Jordan’s structural deficiencies do not help the overall economic situation. This includes the country’s 
reliance on energy imports, which keeps energy prices high, threatening the development of an 
attractive  investment environment (Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2018).  
One of Jordan’s foremost challenges over the last decade has been energy security. Jordan imports oil 
and gas from the region to meet its domestic energy needs and has historically heavily subsidized en ergy 
costs for its residents. Regional instability over the last twenty years has had dramatic effects on the availability and cost of energy supplies, taking a toll on Jordan current accounts. The key to energy 
security in the future will be the developme nt of alternative energy sources, including primarily 
renewable energies.  
Jordan operates as a single -buyer market. Numerous state and private entities are responsible for the 
generation of power, for which the National Electric Power Company (NEPCO) is s ole state -owned 
purchaser. NEPCO operates the transmission system and sells power to private sector power 
distributors operating throughout the country. The Energy and Minerals Regulatory Commission is an 
independent agency that is responsible for setting electricity tariffs and awarding licenses for generators 
and distributors. Energy policy in Jordan is established by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources 
(MEMR), which sets the strategic plan and targets for the country (Franceschini, 2018). MEMR has 
established medium -term energy strategies through 2025 but has not yet developed a longer -term 
energy strategy.  
As noted, Jordan has few petroleum -based resources and meets nearly all of its energy needs (roughly 
90%) by importing petroleum products from the region, although the recent construction of a liquefied 
natural gas (LNG) terminal at the port of Aqaba has allowed it to diversify its supplier base. This reliance on imports has left the country vulnerable to external supply shocks, whi ch historically has resulted in 
large expenditures by the government to subsidize the cost of electricity. For example, “according to state-owned National Electric Power Company (NEPCO), the cost of consumed energy in Jordan 
increased from $3.7 billion in 2010 to $5.6 billion in 2011, largely as a result of disruptions to fuel 
supply” (Power Technology, 2018).  
Beginning in 2013, the government began a program of energy reform and diversification intended to bring NEPCO to a position of cost recovery by 2017 . In addition to efforts to promote energy 
conservation and diversification, one component of this reform was the 2016 adoption of an automatic 
electricity tariff adjustment mechanism (AETAM), which would ensure annual cost recovery of the 
electricity syst em is expected to shield NEPCO’s operating balance from volatile oil prices (World Bank, 
2018). The AETAM was adopted in 2017 and the first price increases took place in 2018. Although the AETAM was applied during most of the year and NEPCO nearly achieved  cost recovery, the increases in 30  |  USAID/JORDAN  USAID.GOV  tariffs arising (in part) from its application led to some brief periods of social unrest and a short 
suspension of AETAM increases (Power Technology, 2018; World Bank, 2018). This raises concerns 
about the political viabil ity of AETAM in the event of a significant increase in the cost of petroleum 
products.  
The most promising approach to attain energy security is to diversify power generation through renewable sources. Jordan’s geography and climate make it well -positioned  to take advantage of 
renewable sources, including solar and wind power. “The country benefits from more than 300 sunny 
days… and a wind speed that can reach up to 9 m/s in specific areas” (Franceschini, 2018:  6). The 
government has identified the developm ent of renewable energy as a high priority and  has set ambitious 
targets in its updated National Energy Strategy for the share of renewable energy solutions at 9% of total energy use by 2020 (Franceschini, 2018). However, scaling up renewables involves substantial risk 
given the long -term nature of investments and dependence on regulatory arrangements (e.g. for off -
take/buy -back) (World Bank, 2016).  
SECTOR STRATEGIC ISS UES 
• Jordan’s energy profile renders it energy insecure due to political or economic shocks in the 
region and complicates the management of its fiscal policy. It requires the development of a long-term energy strategy to promote investment and mitigate this insecurity.  
• While the adoption of the AETAM represents a good approach to addressing t he fiscal 
challenges of variable costs for energy inputs, the impact of electricity rate adjustments on the 
poorest segments of the population represents a social and political concern that may need to 
be addressed.  
• Jordan has the potential to achieve ene rgy security by exploiting renewable energy sources, 
including wind and solar. However, the exploitation of these sources will require substantial 
capital investment and revision of the regulatory framework for energy generation, transmission 
and distribut ion.  
USAID PORTFOLIO HIGH LIGHTS  
The USAID Energy Sector Capacity Building Activity (ESCB) supports Jordanian energy producers, 
utilities and consumers to adopt best practices in energy efficiency and to support the development of alternative and renewable  energy sources. ESCB works with public and private energy sector entities 
and associations to build institutional capacity and develop effective policies to increase the adoption of energy efficiency and renewable energy. ESCB is leading the promotion of women in the workplace and leadership positions in the energy sector.  
ESCB’s major achievement ha s been in creating the regulatory framework to support demand side 
management with utilities, promote renewable energy, and diversify energy sources. The continuous changes of ministers, however, hindered progress on certain work streams. The utilities and regulatory body continue to require more capacity building and on -the-job training, preferably through embedding 
advisors. As engagement by other donors in th is sector increases, USAID determined to roll back its 
support and evaluate its engagement for the future.  USAID.GOV   STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS |  31 HEALTH 
HEALTH SYSTEMS  
The Jordanian health sector has generally achieved relatively high attainment in health outcomes, yet it 
continues to be affect ed by several important challenges with respect to increasing demand and costs, 
poor coordination between the public and private sector, and a highly -centralized system. The health 
care system in Jordan consists of three main sectors –  the public, the priv ate sector, and the 
international and charity sector (USAID, 2015). There are 106 private and public hospitals in Jordan 
providing 12,081 beds (Nazer, 2017), across the country. According to a recent USAID assessment, 
primary healthcare centers are underut ilized, resulting in a greater burden on hospitals and health 
system inefficiencies (USAID, 2017a). Most of the health care services in the Kingdom are provided 
through the Ministry of Health (MOH) system and the Royal Medical Services (RMS); the public se ctor 
accounts for 67% of all hospital beds, though the role of private providers is increasing. UN agencies 
supplement the government health system by providing primary health care services to vulnerable 
populations, and NGOs operate approximately 44 chari table clinics throughout the Kingdom (UNICEF, 
2017).  
The total rate of health insurance coverage in Jordan is in the range of 70% to 93% (World Bank, 2016), 
and Universal Health Care has been prioritized by Jordan’s National Health Strategy 2016- 2020. In 2 011, 
Jordan’s public spending on health as percentage of GDP stood at approximately 6%, almost double that 
of the MENA average (World Bank, 2017). Despite this high spending, significant differences in access 
and high fiscal costs in the current delivery m odel remain. In general, the system bears extremely high 
costs for medications due to a rigid management of prescriptions which result in an overreliance on 
brand name pharmaceuticals over generic drugs (World Bank, 2016). Furthermore, there is an increase d 
demand of health services due to the population growth and high prevalence of non -communicable 
diseases (NCDs), in addition to the presence of refugees and rising health care costs in light of the 
current economic situation (High Health Council, 2015). 
In addition to a rise in health care costs and demand, the Jordanian health sector faces a lack of 
coordination between the three different parts of the public sector (MOH, RMS and University 
Hospitals) as well as with the private sector, resulting in ineff iciencies in the production of health 
services. This is further compounded by very weak referral mechanisms, resulting in excessive demands 
being placed on the more expensive secondary care facilities, while a well -functioning primary care 
service could pr ovide care closer to home more efficiently. A highly -centralized healthcare system is 
also responsible for these shortcomings. Because all expenditures are managed centrally at the MoH, health facilities get an allocation for medicines, equipment, and staf f but do not have individual budgets. 
As a result, health facility managers have little insight into operational costs, thereby having little incentive to contain costs or increase efficiency, as opposed to needs or performance -based budgets. A 
recent asse ssment of health finance and governance also highlighted the fact that MOH data systems do 
not provide useful or actionable cost or financing data, inhibiting improvements to cost effectiveness and 
allocative efficiency.  32  |  USAID/JORDAN  USAID.GOV  SECTOR STRATEGIC ISS UES 
• A highly ce ntralized health system creates few incentives for healthcare professionals and 
managers to contain costs or increase efficiency due to a lack of autonomy. While aspects of 
decentralization have commenced, MOH staff below national level seem ill -prepared f or the 
responsibility.   
• Weak referral systems, poor understanding and use of analytical skills, and increased demand for healthcare services, as a result of the influx of Syrian refugees and the prevalence of non -
communicable diseases, places strains on e ffective and efficient health services delivery.  
USAID Portfolio Highlights  
Most of USAID’s health portfolio in Jordan contributes to Health Systems Strengthening (HSS), including 
specifically the USAID/Jordan Health Finance and Governance (HFG) activity and Health Service Delivery (HSD) activity.  HFG supports efforts to strengthen the sustainability and resilience of the 
Jordanian health sector. It applies a health systems strengthening approach to address structural and 
systems -related weaknesses within Jordan’s health finance landscape, and address gaps and deficiencies 
within public sector health governance. HSD addresses multiple elements of HSS. This includes the 
introduction of the Jordan Maternal Mortality Surveillance and Response system, that ensures MOH is 
notified of every maternal death and investigates the cause to de termine what might be done differently 
to reduce deaths in future.  
The USAID/Jordan Population and Family Health Office (PFH) also directly supports Jordanian reforms. 
For instance, the recently announced Prime Minister’s Renaissance Plan 2019- 2020 will r equire an 
increase in the number of health facilities to be accredited -  an area led by the USAID -supported Health 
Care Accreditation Council (HCAC).  PFH works closely with MOH to identify hospitals and health 
facilities in need of rebuilding or renovatio n. Most notably, USAID has funded a new -build Emergency 
Department for Al -Bashir Hospital, which will open in 2020, and will be capable of seeing 50,000 
attendances/month.  
In 2018, USAID secured a condition precedent requiring the re -licensing of all 175,0 00 healthcare 
professionals every five years. PFH’s implementing partners have been working closely with MOH and 
the three Professional Councils to introduce mandatory Continuing Professional Development which 
will underpin relicensing.  
Recent assessments  have highlighted key lessons for future USAID health programs. For instance, these 
noted that the HFG activity initially began by trying to address too many areas. An unscheduled review 
after a year identified the need to focus on a smaller number of issu es, which it has now done, and this 
approach is bearing clear results already.  
Meanwhile, the Human Resources for Health in 2030 (HRH2030) activity questioned whether their 
beneficiaries were the MOH or members of staff within MOH; this highlighted a fund amental lesson for 
PFH that affects how the team will program for self -reliance in future.  USAID.GOV   STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS |  33 QUALITY OF PRIMARY HEALTH CARE  
Jordan enjoys an advanced health system, with one of the most modern healthcare infrastructures in the 
MENA region, providing a range  of both advanced medical services and basic primary care to most 
citizens at comparatively low costs (World Bank, 2017). The MoH provides primary health care services 
through a wide network of facilities (95 comprehensive health centers, 378 primary healt h care centers), 
in addition to providing maternal, childhood, and dental services through 448 Motherhood and 
Childhood Centers and 387 dental clinics (High Health Council, 2015). The Royal Medical Services and 
UNRWA complement these services through field  clinics, eight comprehensive medical centers, and 24 
medical clinics. Over the last 15 years, the number of health centers in the Kingdom has risen gradually, 
although a recent analysis by the USAID HFG activity found that approvals for new primary health  care 
facilities bear little correlation with population or need, with very wide variations in demands from the different governorates  
The most recent data from the Jordan Population and Family Health Survey (JPFHS) 2017/2018 demonstrates improvements in t he health of Jordanian citizens over the last decade, with notable 
reductions in child mortality and Total Fertility Rates (Department of Statistics (DOS) and ICF (2018). In 
Jordan, USAID has successfully introduced improvements through integrated service delivery within 
primary health care facilities, which improves the efficiency of services and ensures patients are triaged and offered access to all relevant services. Health services in the Kingdom are characterized by relatively 
easy access and are gener ally distributed in such a way that ensures they are reachable in urban and 
rural areas (USAID, 2015).  
Despite these improvements in the health care sector, hospitals remain overcrowded and there is low 
usage of primary healthcare facilities. A 2017 assess ment report found that instead of visiting a primary 
care clinic for a first visit, it is common for patients to go to the hospital directly (USAID, 2017a). As a 
result, emergency rooms are clogged with non -urgent medical cases, causing inefficiencies in s ervice 
delivery and health care workers’ time (for perspective, the Al -Bashir Emergency Department sees over 
50,000 patients per month; the busiest Emergency Room in the US sees around 210,000 annually –  
Bean, 2018). Overuse of hospitals due to the bypassi ng of primary health clinics is a common problem in 
developing economies, particularly in urban settings (USAID, 2017a).  
There is limited evidence on the quality of primary healthcare service delivery in the country. A number 
of studies have signaled deficiencies in the standards of primary and hospital care, such as providers 
spending less than 30% of their clinic time directly providing care (Khoury and Mawajdeh, 2004), patient 
overload, and problems inherent to supervisory and administrative functions (A l-Qutob and Nasir, 
2008).The HSD activity reports that 37% of primary health care centers do not have their own 
laboratory, which typically requires women to make three visits to obtain a full blood test and 
subsequent results. Providers in rural areas fac e financial incentive challenges, transportation issues, lack 
of resources and treatment facilities, and workload issues; all of these factors contribute to a decline in the quality of health services.  
While the Total Fertility Rate has declined, the reaso ns are complex and leave scope for further 
improvements through better access to information and modern contraceptive methods. This remains a 
priority for USAID, which is now working through partner government system (PGS) mechanisms 
directly with MOH to improve uptake of family planning.  34  |  USAID/JORDAN  USAID.GOV  SECTOR STRATEGIC ISS UES 
• Consistency and quality of primary healthcare facilities has improved thanks to USAID activities, 
although significant variation remains.  
• Patients’ bypassing of primary healthcare facilities contrib utes to the inefficient, more costly use 
of secondary care facilities.  
• Improvements in training for family planning providers remains a major goal to ensure women 
are provided a method best suited to their needs, that reduces discontinuation rates  
USAID PO RTFOLIO HIGHLIGHTS  
USAID has consistently sought to improve access to primary care, most notably for family planning. In 
recent years this has been driven by the Jordan communication and advocacy program (JCAP). This has 
been supplemented by work through t he HSD activity to provide vouchers for family planning through 
community health workers who in 2019 are expected to reach over 350,000 households.  
JCAP has also delivered successful multi -faceted anemia campaigns that successfully reached Jordanians, 
resulting in sizeable numbers of women and children being offered testing for anemia.   
Reflections on lessons learned indicate that the reasons for the reduction in the Total Fertility Rate are 
complex and may be linked to the economic climate. The importanc e therefore of promoting the 
Demographic Dividend at both a national and individual level appears to be a relevant and appropriate route for the promotion of voluntary family planning uptake.  
MATERNAL AND CHILD H EALTH  
In 2017, Jordan had a fertility rate of 2.7 children per woman, a significant decrease since 1990, when it reached 5.5 (Department of Statistics and ICF, 2018). Neonatal mortality rate in the same year was 11 
per 1,000 live births, which is 50% lower than the previously reporte d rates of 21 per 1,000 live births in 
1990 (UNICEF, 2017). The maternal mortality rate has also dropped 47% by 2015, from 110 in 1990 to 
58 per 100,000 live births. These achievements undoubtedly saved many lives, although progress has 
been slower than so me others in the MENA region. For example, Lebanon starting from an almost 
identical baseline, yet achieved a 78% reduction in neonatal mortality, and both Palestine and Egypt had 
similar baselines for maternal mortality and achieved a 62% and 69% reductio n respectively.  
Almost all ever -married women (98%) aged 15 -49 received at least one antenatal care visit from a skilled 
provider (doctor or nurse/midwife). In parallel, almost all births (98%) in the Kingdom are delivered in 
health facilities – two thirds  of births occur in public sector facilities while one -third of them occur in 
private sector hospitals. Over 99% of all births were delivered with the assistance of a skilled provider. 
Concerning postnatal care, 83% of women received a postnatal checkup wi thin two days of delivery to 
help prevent complications after childbirth.  
In most developing countries, maternal mortality data is often several years out of date, and with no 
direct understanding of the precise cause of death or how they could be avoided  in future. Jordan’s 
introduction of the Maternal Mortality Surveillance and Response system in early 2018 enables every USAID.GOV   STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS |  35 maternal death to be recorded and followed up to ensure lessons are learned and improvements can be 
made. (UNICEF is now exploring deve lopment of a similar system for newborn, infant and child deaths).  
USAID’s approach in Jordan is focused on a RMNCH+ approach, which works to engage communities; improve information about services; and to raise the quality and management of services. Recen t gains 
include changes in the 1959 Midwifery Law, allowing midwives to fit IUDs, which is an essential element of improving post -partum family planning uptake.  
Women experience barriers to access health care facilities. According to the 2017 -2018 JPFHS, 42% of 
women between the ages of 15 -49 reported experiencing at least one problem in accessing health care. 
The most commonly cited problems to receiving health services are transportation (25%) and not wanting to go alone (24%).  
SECTOR STRATEGIC ISS UES 
• Maternal and child health care services have improved notably in Jordan over the past few years, 
mainly due to USAID’s support through utilization of RMNCH+ approaches (outreach and 
service provision), building capacity of providers, and introduction of surv eillance systems.  
• Access to transportation and the fear of going alone prevent women from accessing healthcare 
facilities. 
USAID PORTFOLIO HIGHLIGHT S 
USAID’s HSD and JCAP activities are working to improve reproductive, maternal, and neonatal health 
outcom es, as well as support family planning and reproductive health services. The five -year HSD 
program (2016- 2021) seeks to protect gains related to women and children’s health outcomes while 
expanding the capacity, availability, and quality of the health sect or to absorb a 20% increase in demand. 
Similarly, JCAP (2014 -2019) works to achieve sustainable gains in family planning and reproductive 
services by integrating female empowerment and increase youth involvement to enable a more 
supportive policy environme nt. 
Reflections on lessons learned indicate that the very high levels of uptake of antenatal care and women 
delivering in a health facility demonstrate that access to health services is good. Future achievements will therefore lie in raising the quality of  care, and this involves application of continuing professional 
development to move away from some antiquated practices, such as placing an infant in a different room to their mother after birth.  
NUTRITION  
Adequate nutrition is a prerequisite for the welfa re of individuals and their development. Chronic 
malnutrition among Jordanian children is relatively low. Between 2002 and 2012, stunting fell from 12% to 8%. However, rates have stagnated in the last five years (Department of Statistics, 2018). Similarly,  
only 2% of children under age five suffer from wasting, while 4% of children are overweight.  
Micronutrients are essential vitamins and minerals that are required to ensure healthy growth of the 
brain, bones and muscles, particularly in the first 2 -3 year s of childhood. International evidence clearly 36  |  USAID/JORDAN  USAID.GOV  demonstrates the long -term health and economic benefits to the individual economic benefits of 
avoiding childhood malnutrition (Hoddinott et al., 2008; Victora et al., 2008). Breastfeeding promotes 
cognitive d evelopment and acts as a child’s first vaccine, giving babies everywhere a critical boost 
(UNICEF & WHO, 2019).  It also reduces the burden of childhood and maternal illness, lowering health 
care costs and creating healthier families. The JPFHS 2017 -2018 indicated that two -thirds of children age 
6-23 months ate foods rich in vitamin A the day before the survey and 28% of children age 6- 59 months 
received vitamin A supplement in the last six months. Furthermore, 60% of children ages 6- 23 months 
ate foods rich  in iron the day before the survey. In contrast, only 13% of children ages 6- 59 months 
received iron supplementation in the week before the survey was conducted (Department of Statistics, 2018).  
Although 92% of children are breastfed at some point in thei r life, only 67% were breastfed in the first 
hour of life and 83% initiate breastfeeding within one day of giving birth (Department of Statistics, 2018). However, only 26% of infants under the age of 6 months are exclusively breastfed and the median durati on is for less than one month. Both exclusive breastfeeding and early initiation of breastfeeding 
within one hour of birth have decreased since 2002, the latter falling from 39.7% to 18.6% (UNICEF, 2019).  
Anemia is considered a mild to moderate problem in Jordan. The 2017- 2018 JPFHS identified anemia 
prevalence in children in Jordan to be around 32% through finger -prick testing, although this is 
considered an overestimation when compared to the periodic Micronutrient Survey which uses a full -
blood test and last reported rates closer to 17% in 2010. The 2017- 2018 JPFHS found that only 13% of 
children aged 6 -59 months received iron supplements in the week before the survey, while only two -
thirds of them ate foods rich in vitamin A the day before the survey was  conducted (Department of 
Statistics, 2018). Similarly, the prevalence of anemia in women as reported in the JPFHS is relatively high suggesting 43% of women aged 15- 49 are anemic, although a separate anemia study in 2017 using a full 
blood sample found 20% were anemic and 29% were iron deficient. The latter survey found moderate and severe anemia prevalence was estimated at 11% and 7% for each group, respectively. Only half of women receive the recommended 90 days of iron supplementation during pregnancy, while 22% never received any iron supplements in their last pregnancy (Department of Statistics, 2018).  
Nutrition in Jordan is poorly understood among healthcare professionals. Within Jordan’s largest university, nutrition is taught and researched by the agricultural faculty; there is no specific element 
within the medical, nursing or midwifery courses. 
SECTOR STRATEGIC ISS UES 
• There needs to be better coordination for nutrition and infant and young child feeding. this will 
also require changes to academic curricula and better coordination of social and behavior 
change interventions .  
USAID PORTFOLIO HIGH LIGHTS  
USAID’s JCAP activity has worked extensively to raise awareness of anemia testing for women and 
children. Some of the causes of anemia will be genetic although most are considered diet -related. PFH 
has therefore prioritized a new award to improve awareness of nutrition -related issues for both 
beneficiaries and health professionals.  USAID.GOV   STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS |  37 Reflections on lessons learned indicate that the levels of anemia in the community, notably in children, 
are probably considerably lower than thought, and the use of a finger -prick single blood drop is 
insufficient to accurately determine a child’s status. Accurate testing can be achieved by pursuing a full -
blood confirmatory test before treatment commences. Furthermore, working with academia to shift nutrition from being an agri cultural discipline to one for health professionals will be vital to advance 
Jordanian healthcare professionals’ understanding and attitudes towards nutrition.   
EDUCATION  
The Jordanian Constitution recognizes a right to education for all its citizens (Jor danian House of 
Representatives, 2011). Per the Education Act No. 3 of 1994, the Ministry of Education is responsible for establishing and administering public education institutions as well as implementing educational 
policy. Public spending on education is low (3.4% of GDP and 10.3% of total public expenditures) in comparison to countries of similar income (World Bank, 2016). This rate of investment has remained 
fairly stable over the last decade, resulting in insufficient national budgetary allocations f or investments in 
new schools and equipment (UNICEF, 2017).   
BASIC EDUCATION  
The national education system in Jordan consists of four stages: pre -primary, basic, secondary, and 
higher education. Most children attend kindergarten, for which there are both government options and 
kindergartens operated by private and non -governmental organizations (NGOs). Basic education is free 
and compulsory for all Jordanian children ages 6 to 16 (grades 1 -10). Currently, Jordan has 3,835 schools 
(1,391 boys; 496 girls; and 1,948 co -ed schools); students undergo evaluation at the end of the basic 
education cycle to enter secondary education, which is comprised of comprehensive secondary (academic and vocational) and applied secondary education (Department of Statistics, 201 7-2018 
academic school year). The secondary education cycle concludes with the Tawjihi, a general secondary examination that allows students to enter university.  
The Kingdom has high enrollment rates for primary, secondary, and higher education, achieving  gender 
parity and making significant progress in providing equal learning opportunities for males and females 
(World Bank, 2016). Despite these achievements, the education system is in stasis, with an outdated 
curriculum and pedagogy, poor learning enviro nments, a lack of integration of information and 
communication technology, and inadequate pre - and in -service teacher training (UNICEF Jordan, 2017). 
These inefficiencies have resulted in poor learning outcomes in the Jordanian basic and secondary educatio n system, as well as in international assessments and the Tawjihi. Every year, over half of school 
students fail their Tawjihi exams and leave school without clear alternative pathways or support 
(UNICEF Jordan, 2017). A substantial majority of those who fail the exam come from rural areas, 
suggesting a significant gap in the quality of education received in rural and urban schools (Ministry of Higher Education, 2015).   
In addition to these factors, the most important risk currently affecting the sector is  the long -term 
effects of Syrian refugees in Jordan. The influx of Syrian refugees is creating a strain on the public 
education system and requires additional financial resources to maintain basic teaching and learning facilities and resources. As of 2017,  there were 1.99 million children enrolled in pre -primary, primary 
and secondary school in Jordan – an increase of over 18% from 2012 (UNESCO Institute of Statistics).  38  |  USAID/JORDAN  USAID.GOV  Staff salaries represent a large proportion of the overall recurrent expenditure for the Ministry of 
Education (MoE). The MoE limited non -staff operating budget has hindered its capacity to supply 
furniture and textbooks, as well as prevented or delayed school construction or renovations, resulting in 
double -shift schools and large classroom  sizes. In addition to having to manage larger class sizes, freshly 
recruited teachers are insufficiently trained, making learning environment less conducive for any 
foreseeable quality educational outcomes.  
SECTOR STRATEGIC ISS UES 
• The influx of Syrian refugees represents the most important challenge for the Jordanian 
education system, placing extra demands on infrastructure, school supplies, and contributing to 
declining learning outcomes. Based upon the Programme for International Students Assessment, 
which has been conducted in Jordan every three years, student achievement has declined since 
2006. “Half or more Jordanian 15- year-olds do not acquire basic level proficiency in science, 
reading and mathematics – twice the OECD average .” (OECD, 2018).  
• The education system has not yet succeeded in equipping students with the specific skills and 
abilities necessary to thrive in the current modern labor market.  
• Poor learning outcomes are reflected on national ( Tawjihi) and international assessments, leaving 
many without a clear path after failing national exams.  
USAID PORTFOLIO HIGHLIGHT S 
Investing over $300 million in school infrastructure, USAID is committed to strengthening the self-
reliance of the Government of Jordan, through direct financing and partnership with local firms, to better plan, design, and construct schools that will continue to benefit future generations of students. 
From 2007 to August 2018, USAID expanded equitable access to education by building 28 new schools, 
expanding and refurbishing 144 schools, and renovating 609 kindergarten classrooms, accommodating over 135,000 students per year.  
The Early Grade Reading and Math Project (RAMP, 2015- 2019) aims to improve teaching and learning by 
introducing new materials and curricula, teacher and administrator’s instructional practices through pre -
service and in -service training, mentoring and supervision, community engagement activities, and support 
for MoE efforts to institutionalize early grade reading and math policies, standards, and assessmen t. 
However, a recent evaluation showed a lack of statistically significant positive impacts on teachers’ 
practices and student outcomes, suggesting a longer exposure period may be required for RAMP to be 
effective (USAID, 2018c).  
The 2014 Jordan School Ex pansion Project (JSEP) sought to renovate and upgrade existing schools to 
reduce overcrowding and class sizes, accommodate growing enrollment, and improve teachers’ ability to 
provide adequate instruction in the classroom.  
A 2018 Education Assessment Scho ol Construction and School Expansion report based on this project 
recommended continuous support to schools in their maintenance efforts which could mean working 
with the MoE and MoPW and conduct regular follow -up visits to schools to ensure spaces are bei ng 
utilized as intended and to understand and address newly developed concerns. Additionally, the report USAID.GOV   STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS |  39 suggested an alignment in construction/expansion activities with ongoing non -construction activities to 
improve teachers’ classroom management skills, positive/nonviolent disciplinary techniques, inclusive 
pedagogical strategies (in addition to providing mentorship to school principals on school maintenance). Furthermore, design and implement long term evaluation strategy is required to establish links b etween 
construction/expansion activities, changes in teaching practices, and student educational outcomes. Last, 
the report encourages the development and coordination of a host -community integration support 
program to decrease the tension between refugee communities, other communities from varying nationalities, and local Jordanian communities.  
TERTIARY AND VOCATIONAL EDUCAT ION 
Jordan has 10 public universities and 18 private higher education institutions, as well as 51 community 
colleges and 191 vocational schools offering a wide range of disciplines (Department of Statistics, 2016). 
The number of students attending tertiary education in the Kingdom has increased over the last decade 
by 43% (Ministry of Higher Education, 2015). Today, the Jordan university  system has approximately 
313,000 students (excluding those in vocational schools), a high number in comparison to countries with 
similar levels of GDP per capita (Ministry of Higher Education, 2015). However, only a small percentage 
of youth participate i n any form of technical or vocational education and training (TVET) (UNDP 2014). 
Students with the lowest grades are directed to the vocational stream, negatively stigmatizing vocational 
education despite the growing needs of the job market (UNICEF Jordan,  2017). There is an oversupply 
of university graduates and chronic undersupply of skilled craftsmen and technicians. Last, youth 
unemployment is running at 31.8% and total workforce participation is only 41%, one of the lowest rates in the world.  
Labor mar ket outcomes for students are an important indicator of the quality of a higher education 
system. A misalignment between education and the labor market is reflected in the high number of graduates specializing in non -technical fields that continues to exce ed demand. Furthermore, the 
outdated and unsuitable Jordanian university curriculum reinforce the sense that the existing education 
system does not adequately support employability in the present or future economy. Nearly a quarter of 
students found the pe dagogical ability of their professors weak and completely ineffective, while 53% of 
students think textbooks are insufficient tools to prepare them for their careers after graduation. Research centers lack modern technology, equipment, and applied laborato ries to produce quality 
scientific research; as a result, their contribution to the national economy remains weak. Over the last 
few years, universities have faced staff shortages, increasing the workload for the remaining faculty 
members and resulting in crowded lecture halls. Consequently, faculty members do not have the time to 
improve their teaching methodologies, leading to weak teaching practices in the classroom.  
In light of high unemployment, a primary objective for the education sector should be to revamp TVET 
programs to support youth’s preparedness for the labor market and be perceived as a desirable option 
for those who do not pursue their academic studies. To  accomplish this, a change in the attitudes and 
behaviors of students, academics, sector leaders, and employers is needed. Historically, Jordanians, both 
men and women, have demonstrated a preference for university degrees over technical and vocational 
qualifications; majors are designed and offered based on student demand rather than the needs of the 
national economy, since universities rely on tuition fees for their sustainability. However, the 
opportunities in the labor market are scarce and students mus t be guided to choose the most suitable 
majors for their individual success and for the benefit of the overall economy  40  |  USAID/JORDAN  USAID.GOV  SECTOR STRATEGIC ISS UES 
• A very low rate of students attending TVET programs as well as a general preference for 
university degrees over technical vocations.  
• A misalignment between the demands of the labor market and the academic fields students 
choose to study.  
USAID PORTFOLIO HIGH LIGHTS  
The Training for Employment activity (2018- 2021) was recently launched to train and employ youth in 
Jordan by up- scaling and sustaining an employment platform that is based on updated information of the 
labor market needs, direct links with the private sector, the ability to train job seekers to available 
vacancies, and consequently placing at least 80% of successful trainees into jobs.  
WATER RESOURCES  
WATER  AND  WASTEWATER INFRASTR UCTURE  
Jordan is the world’s second most water -stressed country (Ministry of Water & Irrigation, 2017). Its per 
capita annual renewable resources of 135 cubic meters in 2014 is fa r below the threshold of severe 
water scarcity, set at an annual 500 cubic meters per capita (World Bank, 2016). This number may continue to decline in the future; recently, the Kingdom has experienced rapid population growth, income growth, and urbanizati on while the supply of renewable water resources remains stagnant. The 
role of water in the Jordanian economy is indispensable for agriculture, energy and mining, transportation, and tourism activities. Traditionally, the Kingdom’s main water supply comes from surface water, groundwater, and treated wastewater sources. Yet as water demand increases, the 
country needs to look for innovative sources of water to supply its population and economic activities.  
To date, Jordan has built 28 dams and 30 wastewater  treatment plans to provide water resources for its 
growing population (Al Ansari et al., 2014). Recent projects to increase the Kingdom’s freshwater supply 
include the Red Sea -Dead Sea Project and the Disi Aquifer Water Conveyance Project. In 2015, Jordan  
and Israel signed an agreement for a $900 million project to build a desalination plant and a 180- km 
pipeline between the Red Sea and the Dead Sea. The plant is expected to produce 80 million cubic meters (MCM) of fresh water annually, increasing water su pply to Israel, Jordan, and Palestine (Allan et 
al., 2014). Since 2013, the $1.1 billion Disi Project has transported 100 MCM annually to Amman and Aqaba – this initiative will last until 2022.  
Non-revenue water (NRW) –  that is leakage, water loss, and wat er theft -  account for an estimated 50% 
of the water supply lost in the country’s network (Al Ansari et al., 2014). Therefore, the maintenance of 
storage dams, rehabilitation of wastewater treatment, reuse of water distribution systems, and increase 
of urban water supply remain priorities for the government. Moreover, inefficient administrative processes and outdated infrastructure are also responsible for this waste. Administrative challenges 
include unbilled water use, illegal extractions from the system and metering issues (e.g. reading errors/inaccuracies, equipment failures, and connections not metered). In some areas of the country, lack of public awareness and personal responsibility, as well as ineffective law enforcement play a significant role in water wastage.  USAID.GOV   STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS |  41 The Kingdom’s geography is also a challenge to water supply. Jordan’s key water resources (main rivers 
and aquifers) are located at a considerable distance from the cities and agricultural areas. Therefore, 
water needs to be transported betwe en the source and the consumer, often covering a great difference 
in altitude. Since 80% of the population lives at elevations higher than the main surface water sources, 
the government has had to invest in an extensive and expensive water network, which needs to be 
constantly maintained and upgraded. This represents a substantial cost for transporting the water and 
vast energy requirements (Grover, V. et al., 2010).  
In recent years, treated wastewater has become increasingly important, contributing to 13.1 % of the 
national water (Yorke 2013). The increase in population has mirrored the amount of wastewater 
produced, resulting in existing wastewater treatment plants being used beyond their capacity. Additional 
stresses on wastewater treatment due to an incre ased population include the influx of over one million 
Syrian refugees but also the illegal extraction of treated wastewater downstream of the As -Samra 
treatment plant, one of the biggest plants in the country.  
SECTOR STRATEGIC ISS UES 
• The country’s geography and water network’s distance from the cities represents a high cost for 
transporting water that constantly needs maintenance.  
• Leakage, water loss, and water theft account for half of the water supply lost in the country’s 
supply network . 
USAID PORTFOLIO HIGH LIGHTS  
To support Jordan in addressing its extreme water scarcity issues, USAID is funding construction of 
water supply projects, sewer collection systems, and wastewater treatment plants. USAID is also funding the four -year Jordan Water Infrastructure Project (JWI). JWI (2018- 2022) will aim to implement 
urgently needed water and wastewater infrastructure improvements and build local capacity to mitigate water supply shortages, public health issues, and economic and industrial impacts caused by recent drought conditions and influx of new refugees.  
Furthermore, USAID/Jordan’s NRW Program (Phase I and II) is employing the use of Fixed Amount 
Reimbursement Agreements (FARAs). This allows USAID to support the GOJ on their NRW targets, but also ensures that the water utilities themselves are implementing the work, gaining experience, and 
receiving payment only after the achievement of specific milestones. This method is a departure from 
past programs and is critical to building the long -term capability of the water utilities to better manage 
their own strategic planning, operations, and maintenance, increasing self -reliance. Presently, USAID has 
two Fixed Amount Reimbursement Agreements (FARAs):  
● NRW Phase I (2015 -2019) provides $60 million thr ough FARAs with the Jordan Water 
Company (Miyahuna) and Aqaba Water to decrease NRW losses in select zones of Amman, 
Madaba, Zarqa, and Aqaba through leak detection, repair, and remediation programs. Phase I 
will establish accurate NRW baselines, document NRW processes to be utilized in the future by 
water utilities and the Water Authority of Jordan and provide tools to inform better decision-making processes. Initial results demonstrated that USAID’s approach can reduce NRW by 
around 23% in pilot areas and  led USAID to expand its NRW work.  42  |  USAID/JORDAN  USAID.GOV  ● NRW Phase II (2018 -2023) has a total estimated budget of $159 million and is comprised of two 
components: Nationwide Water Metering and Monitoring and Emergency Water Loss 
Reduction. Phase II will be implemented across J ordan and partners with Miyahuna, Aqaba 
Water Company, WAJ, the Yarmouk Water Company and the Jordan Valley Authority, 
depending on their eligibility and financial capability to receive the FARA funding.  
WATER MANAGEMENT AND  GOVERNANCE  
The Ministry of Wat er and Irrigation (MWI) is the main public water institution in Jordan. The ministry 
operates at the policy- making level and is responsible for outlining the country’s water strategy, creating 
the national master plan for water use, preparing water studies  and monitoring water resources. 
Second, the Water Authority of Jordan operates under the MWI and is responsible for the operational 
management of water resources and the organization of water supply and wastewater treatment in 
Jordan’s highlands. Addition ally, the Jordan Valley Authority (JVA) is a governmental organization 
responsible for the social and economic development of the Jordan River Valley, including the 
development, use, protection, and conservation of water resources. The JVA’s core activities include 
land and water resource development, as well as supporting the infrastructure in the Jordan Valley (Van 
den Berg, C., & Al Nimer, S., 2016).  
The Syrian refugee crisis and the current fiscal crisis have increased pressure on the water sector in 
Jordan, which hinder the financial sustainability of the sector (OECD, 2014).  The large influx of Syrian 
refugees and the rapid increase in electricity prices have accelerated the cost of providing water and 
increased the dependence of the sector on the government’s budget. The refugee crisis forced the MWI 
to improve existing water supply systems to provide adequate water and increase services in areas 
where refugees reside, as well as construct proper wastewater collection systems to avoid pollution of 
the aquifers (World Bank, 2016).  
Public funding is under strain due to operational and capital costs. The water sector in the Kingdom is 
highly dependent on donor funding to finance its projects. The capital costs are high because significant 
levels of electr icity are required to distribute water throughout cities like Amman, where the highest 
and lowest elevations differ by 400 meters. This compounds an already expensive water supply 
production process. Additionally, high levels of energy are also needed to access declining groundwater 
reservoirs – this heavy reliance on energy imports leaves the Kingdom susceptible to regional and 
market crises (Mahayni, 2015). According to the MWI’s Water Sector Capital Investment Plan 2016 -
2025, a significant challenge is t o reduce the use of groundwater from highland aquifers to sustainable 
levels – this is important both to preserve the resources for urban supply and to preserve the ability of 
the aquifer as a buffer against drought -induced surface water shortfall. Last, be cause management of 
water supply in refugee camps is a major challenge to the Jordanian government, non -government 
organizations like Mercy Corps, UNICEF, and UNHCR have invested in several water infrastructure 
projects such as the installation of two wells and pump stations in Zaatari Camp, the Abu al -Basal 
Pipeline, the Zabdah Reservoir, and the Tabaqet Fahel Well Project (Mercy Corps, 2014).  
Agriculture in Jordan requires intensive irrigation, as only an estimated 5% of the land receives enough rainfall  to naturally support agriculture . Irrigated agriculture in Jordan's highlands relies on overexploited 
groundwater. However, a decrease in water tables and water quality, as well as tougher policy measures 
by the government threaten the sustainability of t his activity which has long thrived on lax law 
enforcement and inexpensive desert land (Al Naber & Molle, 2017). Additionally, priority in water USAID.GOV   STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS |  43 allocation is given to domestic and industrial needs, while what is left is assigned to agriculture. In fact, 
the share of the irrigated agriculture from available water resources has dropped from 70% in 2008 to 
53% in 2017. Future problems with water resources evolve from the pressure to meet the food, 
agriculture, and human needs of a fast -growing economy that ge nerates imbalances between water’s 
demand and supply (Shammout et al. 2018).  
Despite Jordan’s challenging economic and political surrounding conditions, the sector’s difficulties are also attributable to a lack of professionally qualified and sufficiently trained staff in Jordanian water 
institutions. Financial resources for needed investments are limited. In some cases, even basic funding for 
adequate operation and maintenance of existing infrastructure is at risk (MWI- GWP, 2017). In recent 
years, the Jord anian government has made commitments to decentralize management of water supply 
systems based on regions, commercializing water services through public water companies, increasing 
water and wastewater tariffs as well as enforce the law against illegal gro undwater abstraction, and 
introduce renewable energy sources to reduce costs.  
SECTOR STRATEGIC ISS UES 
• The water sector is highly dependable on donor funding to finance water projects and increase 
supply to the country’s population.  
• The Syrian refugee crisis has exacerbated Jordan’s already precarious water sector, adding strain 
on water management systems in host communities and presenting challenges in water supply to 
refugee camps.

GENDER  
Although the Constitution provides equality to all Jordanian citizen s, a number of laws and regulations 
treat women and men differently, often resulting in a negative impact on women’s agency. These laws and regulations cover a wide area of economic and social life, including work conditions, access to 
employment and pensi on benefits, freedom of movement, nationality, and marriage (Bertelsmann 44  |  USAID/JORDAN  USAID.GOV  Stiftung, 2018). This conservative legal framework is further reinforced by restrictive social norms based 
on religious factors, family and pressures, and informal institutions.  
Desp ite a slow increase in women’s political and civic participation in recent years, women remain 
underrepresented in political parties and positions of power in the government and legislature. Reforms designed to increase their involvement include a gender q uota system, which allows women to hold 15 
reserved seats in the House of Representatives. In the latest elections, however, women obtained only 20 (15.4%) of 130 seats, ranking the Kingdom 11th among 19 MENA countries in terms of women’s representation in  the lower house of Parliament (Freedom House, 2018a). Similarly, only 13.8% (9 
female senators out of 65) of senate members are female, a number that has remained stagnant in the 
last decade. More progress has been seen at the local levels of government, where women account for 
41.7% of the municipal council members and 31.7% of the local council seats. Contributing factors to 
women’s limited political participation include the pre -eminence of traditional gender roles, social 
expectations, religious values , and a lack of economic resources (Atiyat 2017).  
The economic situation for women mirrors their political challenges. According to the World Bank, only 
17.8% of women participated in the labor market in 2018 (World Bank, 2019a ), ranking  the Kingdom 
139th  out of 142 countries in women’s economic participation - one the lowest rates in the world 
(World Economic Forum,  2018). Moreover, economic barriers include lack of safe transport, absence of 
child care facilities, limited job growth, and low wages in com parison to men (World Bank, 2018). Last, 
women face gender discrimination in hiring practices, as social norms regard certain careers (such as social service jobs and teaching) as more acceptable for women.  
Women’s financial independence is hindered by de  jure and de facto restrictions that impact their control 
of economic assets. In Jordan, most of the land and property are owned by men – in fact, only 21.3% of 
land owners and 25.6% of apartment owners are female. Despite the absence of legal restrictions  on 
land ownership, the percentage of jointly -titled property is very low -  4.8% for land owners and 4.9% for 
apartment owners (Sweidan 2016). Additionally, social norms further diminish women’s access to land 
by favoring male heirs in inheritance. Since t he default property regime for marriage is separate 
ownership, women have less access to economic assets than men due to a lower labor force 
participation, which translates to fewer assets received in case of divorce. Though dowries are 
considered legal pr operty of women, they are often turned over to the control of husbands, reducing 
women’s ability to access credit through her dowry or losing it in case of separation.   
In contrast to the current political and economic status quos, Jordan exhibits remarka ble equity in health 
and education outcomes. As maternal mortality continues to decline, female life expectancy has risen from 66 to 76.1 years (World  Bank 2019c). In 2005, the Kingdom achieved gender parity in both 
primary and secondary education, also in creasing school life expectancy for both sexes. In recent years, 
the Jordanian government has made a commitment to promote gender equality in the country. As a result, recent improvements to the legislative framework have slightly expanded women’s rights 
concerning alimony, child support, and inheritance. To continue to increase women’s agency in the 
Kingdom, the government must implement stronger legal reforms and ensure their implementation in 
the country. Moreover, providing opportunities for women to en ter the labor force, facilitating an equal 
distribution of economic assets, and equalizing grounds in family and personal issues will alleviate factors 
impeding women’s progress in the nation.  USAID.GOV   STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS |  45 Socio -cultural factors and an overwhelmingly patriarchal societ y greatly contribute to violence against 
women and girls in Jordan. In the 2017 Population and Family Health Survey, almost a quarter (24%) of 
women surveyed had experienced sexual or physical intimate partner violence in the 12 months preceding the survey . Subtler forms of violence included women whose husbands do not allow them to 
meet their female friends (15%) or even family members (11%). Additionally, in a study regarding norms 
and attitudes, a majority of Jordanian men agreed or strongly agreed that wife beating is justified under 
certain circumstances (Al -Badayneh, 2012). These forms of violence, behaviors, and attitudes undeniably 
have devastating physical and mental health challenges for women. In 2018, Damra and Abujilban found a 
positive relation ship between exposure to physical, sexual, control, and psychological violence and 
women’s depression levels. Results revealed that 50% of women surveyed suffered from significant levels of depression (Damra and Abujilban, 2018).  
SECTOR STRATEGIC ISSUES  
• A conservative legal framework, impeding economic barriers, and traditional social values limit 
women’s political and civic participation.  
• Women’s economic participation rate is among the lowest in the world despite their high 
educational attainment.  
• As shown in surveys conducted by USAID’s Takamol activity and reinforced by the Mission’s recent General Population Survey, the persistence of traditional attitudes that inhibit expanded 
opportunities for women and girls remains a factor constr aining progress in female equality.  
• Women do not have control over economic assets, due to a legal system and social norms that 
favor men, creating financial dependency on their husbands.  
USAID PORTFOLIO HIGH LIGHTS  
USAID supports women’s rights and gender efforts through the five -year (2014 -2019) Takamol Project. 
Takamol works with national and local stakeholders to empower government, civil society institutions, 
and individual change agents to address challenges to gender equality and female empowerment in  
Jordan (USAID, 2017a ). A mid -term evaluation conducted in 2017 found that Takamol expanded social 
dialogue on gender equality at the community and national level, established a high level of credibility in 
social dialogue around sensitive gender topics, and increased use of social media to raise gender 
awareness (USAID, 2017a ).   
YOUTH  
Jordan has one of the youngest populations in the world, with 63% of its population under the age of 30, 
and 19.98% of them between the ages of 15 and 24. Despite these hig h numbers, young Jordanians 
remain marginalized by the state and society, experiencing political, social, and economic challenges.  
Young people in Jordan are disproportionately affected by economic exclusion and inactivity; in 2016, 
youth unemployment rat es reached 34%, higher than the MENA average (29.7%) and more than two 
times higher than the rest of the world (13.6%) (OECD, 2018). Jordanian youths’ high levels of 
educational attainment have not translated into higher employment opportunities due to a m ismatch 
between education outputs and skills required by the labor market for university graduates (OECD, 2019). Furthermore, close to one -third of young people in Jordan are NEET ( not in education, 46  |  USAID/JORDAN  USAID.GOV  employment or training); this rate has stayed relatively the same since 2012, putting youth at risk of 
skills deterioration, underemployment, and disillusionment (O ECD, 2018).  
Jordanian youth need more opportunities for political participation and civic engagement. Today, 77.3% 
of Jordanians do not trust the P arliament and 88.3% of them lack faith in political parties. Additionally, 
only 2.3% of youth are members of associations or organizations – these numbers have the potential to 
undermine the democratic system in the long run (OECD, 2019). Moreover, there a re significant 
barriers to political participation for youth. Schools, university campuses, and public social spaces that encourage youth participation and activism are under tight local governing authorities and police 
control. Jordan lacks a comprehensive framework to regulate and coordinate youth legislation, policies, 
and interventions across different sectors. Structural obstacles to political participation and joining public 
office exclude youth in the Kingdom (Milton- Edwards, 2018). As a result, yout h are not involved in 
policy -making processes and political literacy remains low among young Jordanians.   
Health outcomes for young people in Jordan have significantly improved over the last decade. However, 
current health -related challenges include limit ed comprehensive knowledge about sexual and 
reproductive health, a significant increase in the rate of smoking among youth (34.1% for males and 
19.4% for females), and the increasing prevalence of obesity in Jordanian adolescents (OECD, 2019). 
Although the  legal age of marriage is 18, Jordan’s Personal Status Law No. 36 allows judges to authorize 
the marriage of a minor who is at least 15 years of age (UNICEF, 2017). Today, child marriage rates 
reach 8.4%, lower than other countries in the MENA region. The government has committed to 
eliminate child, early, and forced marriage by 2030 in line with the Sustainable Development Goals as well as other commitments at the national level to prioritize this issue in the wake of the Syrian refugee crisis.  
SECTOR STRATEGIC ISSUES  
• Low political participation and civic engagement among young Jordanians results in youth’s 
mistrust in public institutions and undermines the democratic system.  
• An alarming rate of unemployment and underemployment for Jordanian youth thwarts their 
well-being as well as their future social, economic, and political outcomes.  
USAID PORTFOLIO HIGH LIGHTS  
Youth is a cross -cutting priority supported by USAID through myriad USAID activities across DO 
portfolios, and specifically through the Youth Power activity (2017 -2022). Youth Power aims to improve 
the opportunities, well -being, and civic engagement for at -risk youth between the ages of 10 and 29 by 
strengthening, establishing, and increasing access to local systems and programs that serve  youth. Youth 
Power aims to empower youth to act as engaged citizens and productive members of society with the 
agency to advocate for themselves and to shape services designed to better prepare them to enter 
higher education, vocational training, and the workforce.  
The USAID Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening (CEPPS) aims to strengthen 
the development of more democratic and open political processes in Jordan by implementing different 
programs. Through the  Ana Usharek program  imple mented by the National Democratic Institute  (NDI) , 
university students throughout the country have learned about democratic values and political systems, USAID.GOV   STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS |  47 human rights, non -violent dispute resolution, and civic responsibility. The program has reached more 
than 10,000 students across the Kingdom.  
A recent CEPPS evaluation suggests USAID should work with NDI to increase the sustainability of 
NDI’s work with university youth by encouraging national ownership. Additionally, it is important to find ways to expand  the number of participants beyond those already interested in civic participation, by 
increasing efforts to network past Ana Usharek alumni and strengthening program implementation to encourage current alumni networking. Concerning engagement, a thorough review of NDI’s Ana Usharek and Usharek+ experience is recommended to deepen student engagement in the program.  
PERSONS WITH DISABIL ITIES  
Although data on the rate of disability and living conditions for persons with disabilities in Jordan is not easily accessible or consistent, an estimated 13% of the population (amounting to over 1,100,000) has some form of disability (Thompson, 2018). The majority of disabilities in Jordan are related to functional 
physical ability, such as mobility, sight, or hearing ( USAID 2017). In recent years, Jordan has 
demonstrated political will and commitment to developing policies to address the equalization for 
persons with disabilities. Specifically, the Kingdom ratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities in 2008, promulgated the Law on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2017, and 
introduced the 2007 National Disability Strategy to empower persons with disabilities to contribute to 
the social and economic life of the country. Despite these advancements, persons with disabilities continue to experience education, health, and social protection challenges.  
Only 3% of children with disabilities receive a proper education. An estimate from 2014 suggests that 
35.3% of persons with disabilities in Jorda n are illiterate, compared to 11% of the total population 
(Thompson, 2018). Female illiteracy is overrepresented among people with disabilities, as 40% of females 
were illiterate compared to 32% of males. Existing policies promoting inclusion overemphasize  
accessibility to schools as opposed to adapting the curricula for persons with disabilities or training 
teachers. Additionally, there is a lack of qualified teachers who can provide inclusive or special education 
services in regular classrooms, posing a great challenge to implementing inclusion in schools (Al Shoura 
& Ahmad, 2015). Lack of financial resources impedes the implementation of disabled student programs; in fact, a specific budget allocated to cater for the needs of persons with physical disabil ities in the 
education system does not exist.  
Article 24 of Law No.  20 of 2017  grants all persons with disabilities free health insurance ( Hashemite 
Kingdom of Jordan, 2017) . In 2017, however, a third of Jordanians with disabilities were not covered. 
Despi te medical centers being fully accessible and having specially trained staff, transportation issues 
significantly deter disabled patients from receiving assistance. In a recent study, beneficiaries pointed out the timing of treatment sessions and delay of surgeries as their biggest concern, followed by long and 
tiring procedures to obtain medication through health insurance (Al -Tarawneh, 2017).  
Negative attitudes towards persons with disabilities still exist in some Jordanian communities, leading to 
exclus ion and discrimination particularly in the economic sector. In 2017, the employment rate among 
men with disabilities was 32.8%, compared to 61.4% for their non -disabled counterparts (Thompson, 
2018). The rate for women with disabilities reached 5.2%, less than half the rate (13.5%) for non-
disabled women. Evidence indicates that while 88.5% of Jordanians believed people with disabilities have 
a right to work, 69% believed they were unproductive, and cited frequent absences and inability to 48  |  USAID/JORDAN  USAID.GOV  communicate effec tively with coworkers and clients as major obstacles in their work (Al Tarawneh, 
2016). Appropriate education and vocational rehabilitation services such as guidance, training, and job 
referrals would facilitate Jordanians with disabilities to incorporate into the labor force.  
SECTOR STRATEGIC ISS UES 
• Negative social perceptions and stigma surrounding disability pose challenges to education for 
children with special needs and inhibit Jordanians with disabilities from participating in the labor 
force.  
• Inaccessibility or lack of data on disability rates and living conditions for Jordanians with 
disabilities does not allow for effective policy -making.  
SYRIAN REFUGEES  
Jordan has a history of being a haven for refugees; the Kingdom has been known over the years for its 
security and stability. Eight years into the conflict, the impact of the Syrian refugee crisis on Jordan has 
been immense. A 2015 census estimates that Jordan hosts 1.3 million Syrian refugees, of which only half are registered by the UNHCR ( UNICEF, 2018).  Approximately 80% of registered refugees live in host 
communities, primarily concentrated in urban and rural areas in the northern governorates of Jordan, with lesser populations in the southern parts of the country. The remaining Syrian re fugees live in 
camps, mainly in Zaatari Camp (80,000), Azraq Camp (36,040) and the Emirati Jordanian Camp (7,000) (Jordan INGO Forum (JIF), 2018).  
Despite hosting the fifth -largest refugee population in the world, Jordan has a precarious refugee policy. 
The Kingdom is not a signatory to the UN’s 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees or its 1967 
Protocol (Francis, 2015). As a result, refugees are not allowed to enjoy certain rights under this 
convention, such as the right to housing, employment, public e ducation, freedom of movement, and 
public relief and assistance (ILO, 2015). Nonetheless, Jordan has a progressive stance on refugees and 
upholds international standards of their treatment, allowing Syrian children access to public education and access med ical care at the same rate as uninsured Jordanians. (JIF, 2018).  
The influx of Syrian refugees has brought a significant burden on the economy and water resources infrastructure in the Kingdom, and placed severe strains on education and health institutions, which were already suffering from issues before the refugee crisis. During the 2016 -2017 school year, 126,127 
Syrian children were enrolled in public schools thanks to the introduction of double -shifts; however, 
40% of Syrian school -age children remain out of school (JIF, 2018). The major reasons for dropping out 
of school for Syrian children are: families could not afford the associated costs (13%) and secondly 
because of security and safety concerns for the children (17%) (UNICEF 2018). In 2018, the co st of 
health care for Syrian refugees was raised to the same rate as foreigners, tripling the cost of health 
services. USAID led an initiative to create a multi -donor account to defray the costs that refugees face in 
the health sector. Thanks to this effor t, fees have since returned to the same health fees as uninsured 
Jordanians. The cost of healthcare is the most significant impediment for refugees to access medical 
services for chronic conditions ( Dunmore and Cherri, 2018) . Other obstacles to access incl ude a lack of 
female physicians for perinatal care, lack of transportation from camps to nearby clinics, and lack of birth 
certificates and documents confirming refugees’ legal status (Al -Rousan et al., 2018).  USAID.GOV   STRATEGIC SYNTHESIS |  49 According to UNHCR, 93% of all Syrian refugees outside of camps live below the poverty line. 
Approximately 86% of Syrian refugees are living below Jordan’s poverty line. Many of these refugees are 
forced to employ negative or crisis coping mechanisms, incl uding child labor, forced marriage and sexual 
gender -based violence (JIF, 2018). Syrian refugees do not have the financial means to undergo civil 
documentation processes, they tend to fear interacting with Jordanian authorities, and they often 
receive the wrong information when seeking identity documents. Because Syrian refugees do not have a 
right to work in Jordan, only 10% of employed Syrians have formal work permits, while those working 
outside camps are often employed in the informal economy and outsid e the bounds of Jordanian labor 
law (ILO, 2015). Consequently, Syrian workers are generally paid less, work longer hours, and have 
poor working conditions and regulations, including lack of proper work contracts.  
SECTOR STRATEGIC ISS UES 
• The Jordanian gove rnment’s lack of a comprehensive national refugee policy or refusal to sign 
international conventions limits the rights of Syrian refugees in the country.  
• The large influx of Syrian refugees over the past eight years has placed an enormous strain on 
the ec onomy, resource infrastructure, schools, and public health institutions. Despite this 
challenge, Jordan has continued to manage the crisis, ensuring services do not further 
deteriorate and maintaining the status quo.  
• Barriers to receive legal documentation  impede Syrian refugees from accessing better 
opportunities in the labor marke t. 
USAID PORTFOLIO HIGH LIGHTS  
Support to Syrian and other refugee communities within Jordan is embedded within several USAID 
activities and portfolios, including health, educatio n, economic development, and others. JCP, for 
example, supports and works through the Jordan Compact Project Management Unit (PMU) housed 
within the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC) to streamline and facilitate the 
issuance of Syr ian work permits in sectors prioritized by the Jordan Compact .
