Abstract
Although tuberculosis is a treatable dis-
ease, the high frequency of treatment
default remains a challenge. The use ofmobile phones structurally in a TB programhas the potential to lower the frequency ofdefault. However, it’s impact on treatmentoutcome in Sudan has not yet been evaluat-ed. The aim is to evaluate the potential useof cell phones for lowering treatmentdefault. We conducted a controlled inter-vention pilot study during the period from1st of May 2017 to 31st of March 2018, ineight TB treatment units in Khartoum state,Sudan. Newly diagnosed patient with posi-tive sputum smear on DOTS therapy wereenrolled in intervention and control groups.SMS reminder were sent to the interventiongroup.Assessments were done at the begin-ning and at the end of the treatment. Onehundred and forty-eight patients wereenrolled, seventy-four patients in eachgroup.The participants in the two groupswere similar in demographic characteristicsand behavioral and knowledge related fac-tors about TB disease at baseline. Thepatients in the intervention group had alower default rate (6.8%), higher document-ed cure rate (78.4%), better knowledgecompared to control group. SMS reminderwas useful and facilitated good interactionbetween patients and health personnel.
Mobile texting seemed useful and was high-ly accepted by participants. Further evalua-
tion of it’s potential benefit was warranted.
Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) is the ninth
leading cause of death worldwide and the
leading cause from a single infectiousagent, ranking above HIV/AIDS.
1
Moreover, it continues to be a major globalcause of death and morbidity, dispropor-tionately affect the poorest communities.
2,3
Thus WHO recommend directly observed
treatment short course (DOTS) strategy.4,5
This strategy aims to detect individuals withsputum smear-positive tuberculosis, initia-tion of anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy andadherence to treatment and decreasedefaulting rate. Treatment of active pul-monary TB patients remains the most effec-tive strategy to stop the spread of the dis-ease.
6,7Defaulting from treatment may
remain the major challenge to control TB.In addition, it increases the risk of drugresistance, relapse, and death and may pro-long infectiousness.
8,9
Sudan shoulders about 15% of TB bur-
den in the Eastern Mediterranean Region andhas the second highest active TB prevalenceof the countries in this region.
10In line with
WHO, Sudan adopted DOTS strategy since1993. Despite the efforts that had beenundertaken by health authorities still somepatients fail to adhere to TB treatment andeventually default before completing thetreatment. There are many factors leading tohigh default rate in Khartoum state. Theseinclude: socio-demographic factors; beha-vioral factors, disease and treatment relatingfactors; lack of knowledge and stigma anddefault tracing team problems.The defaulttracing is major challenge to TB control pro-gram in Khartoum State, this due to widearea of the State, shortage of staff, shortageof transport facilities for default tracingteams.
8,11As defined by the WHO, patients
who fail to collect their TB treatment for 2consecutive months are reported as default-ers (World Health Organization, 2002.
12
The use of mobile phones has substan-
tially increased throughout the world overthe last decade and also in Sudan. The glob-
al expansion in cell phone use presents newopportunities to incorporate mobile phonesinto health care delivery services.
13-15The
World Health Organization (WHO) hasdefined mHealth as ‘medical and publichealth practice supported by mobiledevices, such as mobile phones, personaldigital assistants and other wirelessdevices.
16
Thus we conducted an intervention
comparative study in Khartoum province,
Khartoum state aiming to determine the
approach of use of mobile phone in improv-
ing adherence and decreasing the default
rate among patients receiving TB medica-
tion under DOTS program. 
Materials and Methods
Study design
To evaluate the potential use of cell
phones for improving adherence to treat-ment, we conducted a controlled interven-
tion pilot study in TB patients on a DOTSprogram. Those TB patients who owned acell phone or had shared access to such adevise formed the intervention group. These
patients received the current standard ofcare with the addition of informative textmessages. TB patients on the same DOTSprogram who did not have access to a cellphone received the current standard of careand were the control group. The trial wasconducted in Khartoum state. We conductedthis study to determine the effect of cellphone usage in decreasing TB treatmentdefault.
Setting
This study was conducted in Khartoum
province, Khartoum State. The patientswere recruited form 8 TB treatment units. Aregistered nurse is responsible for promot-ing and checking treatment adherence aswell as for tracing the patient in case ofmissing a planned follow up visit. Otherpersonnel in a TB treatment unit include amedical doctor or a specially trained med-ical assistant, a laboratory technician and aclerk. The tuberculosis control program hasbeen described in detail elsewhere.

All TB patients who participated in a
DOTS program and were registered at the
participating centers were eligible.Inclusion criteria were: newly diagnosed,smear positive pulmonary TB, age over 15years and the provision of informed con-sent. Exclusion criteria were: psychiatric ill-ness, limited vision, extra-pulmonary orrelapsing TB.
Patient accrual
Patients who had access to a cell phone
were considered the intervention group.After each such patient who consented toparticipate the next patient(s) withoutaccess to a cell phone were asked to partic-ipate in the control group.
Standard of care
All patients were in a DOTS program
according to the TB control program strate-gy in Khartoum State. This strategy coin-cides with WHO recommendations. TheDOTS program consists of 6 months of TBtreatment. In the first 2 months (intensivephase) patients receive 4 drugs: isoniazid,rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol.Hereafter, patients receive 4 months of iso-niazid and rifampicin (continuation phase).All patients came on a daily basis to the TBcenter to take their medication in the pres-ence of health care personnel.
17All patients
who interrupted their treatment were tracedby the routine methods carried out by theTB control program in Khartoum State.
Intervention
The patients in the intervention group
received standard of care, with the additionof text messages every 48 hours during thefirst 2 months and hereafter weekly till theend of treatment. The content of the textmessages is displayed in Table 1. Also,these patients received a telephone call at
least once during the first week of theirtreatment. In case of treatment interruption,the patients received cell phone messages toencourage them to come back and continuetheir treatment. Moreover, on top of theusual tracing activities performed by the TBcontrol program, they received telephonecall, additional text messages and, if need ahome visit.
Data collection methods
The data collection was done by 2
trained persons who recorded demographic,disease related factors and treatment relatedvariables from the medical records. In addi-tion, a face to face interview was done, usinga semi- structured questionnaire, to elicitinformation on the various factors possiblyassociated with treatment default (Figure 1)Definition of outcomes
Treatment default was defined as a
patient who failed to collect his TB treat-
ment for 2 consecutive months. A docu-mented cure was defined as a patient whowas smear- or culture-negative in the lastmonth of treatment and on at least one pre-vious occasion.
18Knowledge of TB disease
and its treatment was defined as “the facts,feelings, and experiences reported by thepatient.
19This was implemented using the
following 5 questions: do you hear aboutTB disease before you had it?, do you knowduration of treatment?, what you expect ifyou stop treatment?, can TB be cured?,when to stop TB treatment? and do youknow the cause of TB?
Finally, in the intervention group the
perceived usefulness of the text messageswas assessed.

Non-commercial use onlyBiometrics
Sample size was calculated by using the
WHO calculator for a controlled study. The
default rate among TB patients reported bythe National TB control program in Sudanwas 11%. We expected an improvement indefault rate to 5% (or less). Hence, with Atype I error – two-sided of 0.05 and a 80%of power, the sample size was calculated tobe 138 patients. We reviewed 148 patients(74 in each group).
20
All calculations were done based on the
intention to treat principle. Data analysiswas performed in SPSS (Statistical packageof Social Sciences) version 21. Chi-squaretests were performed for qualitative vari-ables and Student’s t tests for continuous(outcome) variables. In addition, thedefined outcomes were related to group ofassignment, adjusted for potentially con-founding variables using logistic regressionanalysis. 
Ethical considerations
Ethical approval was obtained from
Ministry of Health of Khartoum State ethi-cal Committee. Informed verbal consentwas secured from every eligible patientincluded in this study before the interview.All participants were informed that theinterview was entirely voluntary. Privacyand confidentially were maintained duringdata processing and reporting. Also,patients who participated were informedthat they had the right to end the initialinterview at any time, or refuse participa-tion during the follow up at any time.
Results
Participants
Between the period 1st of May 2017 to
31stof March 2018, a total of 169 consecu-
tive patients who initiated TB treatmentbased on the inclusion and exclusion criteriawere assessed for eligibility to participate inthis study. Of these, 148 were enrolled in thestudy and 21 patients met an exclusion crite-rion. The demographic characteristics of theintervention and control groups are given inTable 2.
Patients in the intervention and con-
trol group were well matched, and none ofthe differences were statistically or clinicallysignificant. The participants in two groupswere also similar in behavioral related fac-tors and knowledge about TB disease atbaseline (Tables 3 and 4). 
Adherence to intervention and con-
trol group assignment
All 74 patients in the intervention group
received text messages and telephone calls

patients responded to our SMS’s and textedor called back. A total of 61(82.4%) patientsof the intervention group were able to readand send SMS’s, while 13(17.6%) patientsshared the mobile phone with their familiesas they were not able to use it or read themessages themselves. There were72(97.3%) patients in the interventiongroup who rated the SMS’s as very useful,useful or may be useful while only 2 (2.7%)patients rated the SMS’s as not useful. 
There were 70(82.4%) patients asked
for counseling assistant, while 36(48.6%)patients provided a request regarding infor-mation about side effect of drugs and24(32.4%) patients asked for Medicationand social support. 
None of the 74 patients in the control
group received the SMS messages.However, the responsible treatment centertried to call or trace the 8 patients who didnot appear on their planned visits. Allpatients completed the study protocol.Adherence to the TB treatment 
protocol
The patients in the intervention group
had a lower default rate (6.8%; 5 out of 74
patients) compared to those in the controlgroup (10.8%; 8 out of 74 patients). Thisdifference was not statistically significant(P-value 0.563; OR: 1.673, 95% C.I. 0.521-5.374). The patients in the interventiongroup had higher cure rate 58 /74 (78.4.0%)compared to 44 (59.5) of the 74 patients inthe control group (P-value 0.020; OR:2,472, 95% CI:1.133 – 5.434). 
Knowledge of TB disease and its
treatment between the groups 
At the beginning of treatment, knowl-
edge of TB disease an its treatment, were
similar between the groups, with odds ratiosvarying between 0.78 to 1.32 (Table 5). Atthe end of treatment, the knowledge in theintervention group was better than in the con-trol group for all 5 variables, and was statis-tically significant in 3 of them (Table 5).Knowledge of TB disease and its
treatment in relation to treatmentdefault and documented cure
There was no statistically significance
found between the patient’s knowledge and
treatment default among the interventiongroup for all 5 knowledge variables. In thecontrol group a single variable (‘knowwhen to stop’) was statistically significant,(OR: 7.421; 95% CI: 1.374-40.085;P<0.015). Full information is presented inSupplementary Table 1.
In the intervention group the relation-
ship between patient’s knowledge and doc-umented cure was statistically significant,namely ‘duration of treatment’ (OR: 6.136;95% CI: 1.417-26.581; P<0.019)and whento stop treatment (OR: 4.371; 95% CI:1.211-15.784; P<0.028). In a multivariateanalysis the variable ‘when to stop treat-ment’ remained statistically significant inthe model (OR: 2.261; 95% CI: 1..050-4.870; P<0.037). In the control group, nostatistically significant relationship was

Discussion
The present study explored the use of
mobile phone services to decrease defaultrates in newly diagnosed patients withsmear positive results for MycobacteriumTuberculosis (TB) who received treatmentunder a DOTS program. We found thatpatients in the intervention group had alower default rate (albeit not statisticallysignificant), a statistically significant higherdocumented cure rate and better knowledgethan those in the control group at end of thetreatment period, regarding the duration oftreatment, what to expect if treatment isstopped and when to stop TB treatment.Also, it was observed that there was à statis-tically significant relationship betweenpatient knowledge (know when to stop TBtreatment) and TB treatment default amongpatients in the control group. In addition,there was a statistically significant associa-tion between the patients’ knowledge anddocumented cure rate (duration of treatmentand when to stop treatment) among theintervention group. Moreover, the use ofmobile phone services created good oppor-tunities for interaction between health per-sonnel and patients in the interventiongroup who often responded by texting orcalling back, asking about drug side effectsand requesting for help and social support.Finally, most patients in the interventiongroup were positive about the mobile serv-ices. The TB treatment default rateobserved in the control group in this studywas (10.8%) which is high compared toWHO target maximal default rate of (3%).
21
However, it is lower than those reported(14%) in recent studies conducted in thesame geographical area.
8,11A potential
cause could be the relative high education
of residents from Khartoum state and the
patients who participated in the study, com-pared to other regions of Sudan.
22,23 Our
observations regarding the association
between SMS text messages reminders anddefault rate and documented cure rate con-
firms the results of previous studies con-ducted in both developed and developing
countries.
24-27 However, our findings were
in contrast to that reported by Sabine M H
form Uganda and Cameron that SMSreminder did not show any differencebetween intervention and control group.
28,29
Our observation that the SMS recipients,texted or called asking help and social sup-port were similar to those reported in India
and Uganda, in which study the recipientalso were favorable about the use of mobileservices.

TB is a chronic disease and its treatment
lasts for more than 6 months. In addition,the treatment needs multiple drugs that areto be taken once daily for this period. Afterstarting treatment patients usually feel bet-ter since symptoms and signs improve ordisappear. Hence some patients may discon-tinue, forget or stop their treatment. Such adefault in finishing appropriate treatment isa danger for the spread of the disease, aswell as induces multi-resistant TB bacteriastrains. Texting can be sent every morningto remind patients to take treatment. Thepatient can reply with SMS confirming tak-ing medication. Moreover, short messageservice (SMS) are cheap and quick meansof communication between health person-nel and TB patients. In fact, the availabilityand wide spread use of mobile phones is anencouraging fact that would help imple-mented texting successfully in a TB controlprogram. However, there are challengesfacing the use of this communication meansthat need consideration. For example,mobile phones needs electric charging andpatients may live in the absence of suchfacilities. In addition, the telecommunica-tion network may be weak in some areas. 
Although, we conducted a pilot study
and did not do formal calculation of theactual cost of the mobile services, the obser-vations in the present study show promisingresults with regard to lesser treatmentdefault, higher documented cure rate andincreased knowledge of the patients. Webelieve that a properly powered and fundedstudy is warranted to explore this possibili-ty. Moreover, mobile phone services may bein general of help for health personnel andpatients to have an improved interaction. 
Some methodological aspects of this
study require attention. First, our study wasconducted in Khartoum State, which is themost populated state in Sudan. Most of theinhabitants come from various parts ofSudan so it is likely that subjects included in
the study may represent the whole country.
Second, recall bias was minimized by using
a semi standardized questionnaire during theinterview and by cross-checking patients’responses for each study variable againsttheir medical records. Third, the reliability
of the information gathered from eachpatient could not be counter-checked but
questions about sensitive issues were care-
fully handled to maximize the accuracy of
the responses obtained. Fourth, the samplesize was calculated using previous reports of
default rates in Sudan. However, theobserved frequency of default was substan-tially lower in the control group. Hence, the
power to find a similar relative effect wasreduced. Fifth, for this pilot study we used acontrolled but not randomized design.However, the demographic characteristics ofboth groups were similar, most importantlyfor education and by using logistic regres-sion analysis. Finally, a major challenge dur-ing the study was how to reach the default-ing patients in the two groups. This wastackled in 3 steps. First, the patient medicalrecords were traced and identified and allcontact information was reviewed. Allpatients who interrupted their treatmentwere traced by the routine methods carriedout by the TB control program in KhartoumState. Then, for the control group patientsstudy personnel first tried to telephone thepatient and, failing that, to telephone knownfamily members or friends. If telephone con-tact failed or if there was no telephone num-ber on record, home visits were made, firstto the patient and then to a known familymembers or friends. If the patient was nottraced in the intervention group, the patienttext-messages. Moreover, they received atelephone call, additional text messages and,if need a home visit. Interestingly, alldefaulting patients responded. They cameback and continued their treatment (only 3of them needed home visits two among thecontrol group and one among the interven-tion group). 
Conclusions
We believe that our data shows promis-
ing results to lower treatment default inpatients with TB using mobile services thatincluded both texting and if required calls.Hence, we recommend the conduction of aproperly powered randomized clinical trialin a region with similar social conditions toestablish its clinical effectiveness and docu-ment the associated extra costs.
