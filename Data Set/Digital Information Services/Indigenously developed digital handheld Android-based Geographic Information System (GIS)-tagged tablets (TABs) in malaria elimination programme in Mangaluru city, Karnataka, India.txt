Abstract 
Background: Under-reporting, delayed diagnosis, incomplete treatment and inadequate vector management are 
few among many factors responsible for uninterrupted transmission of malaria in India. Information technology (IT) 
and mobile apps can be utilized effectively to overcome these hurdles. Indigenously developed digital handheld geo -
graphic information system (GIS)-tagged Android-based tablets (TABs) has been designed especially for implementa-tion of digitization protocol. This has changed the effectiveness of malaria surveillance and intervention strategies in a malaria endemic area of Mangaluru city, Karnataka, India.
Methods: A software was developed and implemented for control measures to create a digital database of each 
malaria case. Secondary data analyses were carried out to determine and compare differences in malariometric indi-
ces between pre- and post-digitization years. With the introduction of this software active surveillance, information education and communication (IEC), and anti-vector measures were made ‘incidence-centric’ . This means that the entire control measures were carried out in the houses where the malaria cases (index cases) were reported and also in surrounding houses.
Results: Annual blood examination rate (ABER) increased from 13.82 to 32.8%. Prompt reporting of new cases had 
improved (36% within 24 h and 80% within 72 h). Complete treatment and parasite clearance time were documented 
in 98% of cases. In the second post-digitization year untraceable cases reduced from 11.3 to 2.7%; contact blood smears collection also increased significantly (p < 0.001); Slide Positivity Rate (SPR) decreased from 15.5 to 10.48%; 
malaria cases reduced by 30%.
Conclusions: IT is very useful in translation of digitized surveillance to core interventions thereby effectively reduce 
incidence of malaria. This technology can be used effectively to translate smart surveillance to core interventions fol-
lowing the ‘1-3-7-14’ strategy.

Background
India is a signatory to the National Framework of Malaria 
Elimination (NFME) with a goal to eliminate malaria by 2030 [1]. Global technical strategy (GTS) of the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended a 3-pil
-
lar transforming surveillance into core interventions for malaria elimination [2]. However under-reporting, delayed diagnosis, incomplete treatment and inadequate vector management are few among many factors respon
-
sible for uninterrupted transmission of malaria in India [2, 3]. Currently, malaria surveillance is the weakest in 
countries with highest malaria burden, rendering it diffi
-
cult to accurately assess disease trends and plan interven -
tions. Only about one-tenth of the estimated 198 million cases that occurred in 2013 were detected and reported through national malaria surveillance systems (WHO’s uncertainty range for malaria cases is 124 to 283 million) [4, 5]. Even there is a huge disparity of malaria burden in 
India. In 2017, the WHO reported an estimated 219 mil
-
lion malaria cases and 435,000 related deaths in the world where India’s contribution was 4% with 9.6 million cases and 16,723 deaths. In contrast, National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) reported 0.84 million malaria cases and 174 related deaths. This means there is a serious problem of case reporting system due to poor surveillance in many states [1].
Information technology (IT) and mobile apps can be 
utilized effectively to overcome these hurdles. IT, in particular, might help by networking all the stakehold
-
ers for generating real-time communication of informa -
tion to implement appropriate and timely intervention measures. Currently, Android-based mobile apps are under process of deployment in the field. An innovative open data kit (ODK)-based Android app named SMART malaria surveillance for malaria case investigation has been developed in Ethiopia. This device uses Google Maps and embedded geo-referenced house census data. Here the surveillance assistants (SAs) obtain all necessary basic information of each malaria case from the outpa
-
tient department register book. The SAs create an index case record including the hamlet name after determining the illness criteria. This information helps case investiga

tion in the field [6].
Similarly, in Philippines, an Android web-based online 
malaria information system (OLMIS) has been developed to serve as a tool for data collection, processing, report
-
ing and use of information contemplating the malaria elimination strategy. The system can work offline also. The health workers can easily record diagnosis and treat
-
ment with the apps in hand. The OLMIS system is cur -
rently in the final stage of field testing and ready for full implementation [7].
Mangaluru city is situated on the southwestern coast of 
Karnataka state, India. The local metropolitan area with a population over 0.6 million is endemic for malaria since 1995 [8–10].
Anopheles stephensi was incriminated for vector of 
malaria in this city [11]. There was a boom in construc
-
tion-related work which was associated with migratory labourers from various parts of the country mostly from malaria endemic states of Odisha, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and states of northeast India. Labourers from other malaria endemic districts from Karnataka also migrated to the city engaged on the construction work. This was one of the main reasons for malaria transmission in the city [12]. Various control pro
-
grammes at the national level such as Modified Action Plan (MAP) in 1995, National Malaria Eradication Pro
-
gramme (NMEP) in 1999, NVBDCP in 2002, and subse -
quent modified versions of these control strategies have been implemented in the city from 1995 till 2014. How
-
ever, these programmes had very variable impacts on the disease in this city which is contributing 70–80% of total malaria cases in Karnataka [1, 10]. Plasmodium vivax 
is the predominant species contributing around 85% of the total malaria cases in the city [10, 12]. The local civic 
authorities engage multipurpose workers (MPWs) for carrying out work related to all vector borne diseases in the city. They follow work protocols as per the guidelines of NVBDCP . Before launching the digitized protocol, the reporting of cases and the action taken were docu
-
mented manually. Hence, data retrieval was time con -
suming leading to frequent delays in surveillance, source reduction, anti-vector activities and follow-up of cases to ensure complete treatment. Moreover, the data were not readily available to be compiled for any specific pur
-
pose. The surveillance system was not properly organized and effective. The MPWs were given a target to cover 40 houses in a day with manual formats and guidelines. All deficiencies in implementation of control measures led to a cascading effect with a chain of transmission cycles not being interrupted. There was also a little or no timely action to control and prevent new cases. Moreo

ver, no geographical location of disease source could be made available readily. This meant that no focused source reduction steps could be taken up in a timely manner to Keywords: Malaria, TABs, Mobile app, GIS, Software, Information technology, Digitization, Smart surveillance,

of Mangaluru. Information technology (IT) and mobile apps were utilized effectively to overcome such hurdles by improving networking of all stakeholders for real-time transfer of information for necessary and timely inter

vention measures.
The gaps, hurdles and deficiencies in implementation 
of malaria control programme in Mangaluru city were identified after evaluation of existing programme. In view of these challenges identified, in July 2014 the local civic authorities decided to digitize malaria surveillance and control programme with an aim to enhance timely reporting and focused interventions for better source reduction, complete treatment, and vector control mainly larval breeding habitats.
This article describes the design and implementation 
of this digitization protocol and presents initial second

Methods
Development of GIS‑based software
Malaria Control System  is a state of the  art suite of software product to transform existing programme in the Mangaluru city into  a technology driven intelli

ial activities (Fig.  1). At the core, this system is a 
GIS-tagged mobile app for civic body field force for reporting and monitoring of incident cases as per the NVBDCP guidelines, mosquito breeding site report

ing and intervention monitoring [13]. Civic body, geo -
graphical and administrative structures are mapped into  the software for efficient monitoring, workload allocation and reviews. It has an online (web) app for healthcare providers (hospitals, diagnostic clinics etc.) to report malaria cases, and submit statutory reports. Back end data is automatically generated to excel sheet and analyses were carried out to identify the hot spots, high risk wards, and also fortnightly/monthly trends. Another online (web) app is also linked to analyse effec

Introduction of digital TABs in malaria surveillance
In the digital India era, most of the health staffs have experience in using Android-based smart phones. This helped in better understanding of the operational pro
-
cedures of the working systems. Initially, field trials were carried out to study the operational feasibility and trou
-
bleshooting along with enhancement of systems. Eight MPWs were given hands-on training in the field dur
-
ing field trials, and these trained MPWs in turn trained other 54 MPWs in the field. In October 2015, the pro
-
gramme was scaled up to cover the entire city of Mangal -
uru spread over in 60 wards (Fig.  2). Additional training 
was carried out in the field for the needy ones. Separate workshops and training programmes were conducted for laboratory technologists, MPWs and hospital authori
-
ties both in private as well as public health systems for reporting of cases before scaling up of the programme to the entire city. At present the programme is governed and maintained by the local civic authorities.Malaria control programme after digitization
Malaria control operations in Mangaluru city were fully digitized in October 2015, and a network between diagnostic centres, field workers (MPWs) and admin
-
istrators was established. As soon as a case of malaria was diagnosed in the field or any laboratories, hospi
-
tals and malaria clinics, assigned personnel were stat -
utorily required to login and enter case information through online web portal into the software. Hospi
-
tals and clinics both in public and private health sys -
tems began to report malaria cases online. Information on newly reported cases was made available from the TAB devices provided to each MPW. Online entry of new case triggered an alert to these workers on their TABs who in turn mandatorily visited the households, meet patients and their families, ensure complete treat
-
ment and survey the neighbourhoods. These TABs are loaded with software/app which provided them infor
-
mation regarding anti-malarial activities to be carried out as per the NVBDCP guidelines. Activities included search for source of mosquito breeding sources, collec

malaria-positive households. MPWs were instructed 
to record all their visits and activities on their devices. It was mandatory for them to close each malaria posi

plete action in the field. GIS-tagged patient information helped the MPWs to visit these houses and record pre-determined information about cases and field activities. The activities and movements of the MPWs were moni

tored through GIS.
City corporation executives were motivated to use only 
data from the online system for their reviews and pres -
entations instead of the data from manual records and registers. Currently, 70 field workers (MPWs, Health Supervisors) and 85 health care providers (hospitals, clinics, and diagnostic centres) are using these apps/solutions.
Secondary data (pre‑ and post‑digitization) analysis
Study design
Process of digitization This is an uncontrolled field trial 
to know the impact of application of digitization software 
on operational parameters of malaria control as com -
pared with situation before interventions. All cases of malaria reported in the geographical area of Mangaluru Municipal Corporation were included in the study. Cases diagnosed by the local diagnostic labs, hospitals, malaria clinics, and also surveillance teams, by microscopic exam
-
ination of blood smears, rapid diagnostic test (RDT) kits and quantitative buffy coat (QBC) fluorescent technique were also included.
Between October 2014 and September 2015 digitiza

ducted and all the activities carried out were manually documented. First year post-digitization is considered as PDY1 (October 2015 to September 2016), and second year post-digitization is represented as PDY2 (October 2016 to September 2017). Post-digitization is the phase when the software was accepted and well utilized by all the stakeholders namely diagnostic laboratories, hospi

Data inputs Both active and passive surveillance data, 
case management details, anti-larval activities under -
taken, were considered as real-time digital data on the

tion.
Data analysis Collected data were analysed as follows:1. To assess improvement in surveillance reporting 
time, and field action.
a. Time taken to report a malaria positive case. This indicated reporting behaviour of health workers and facilities (laboratories, clinics and hospitals). This was carried out as back end analysis in the first 15 months after implementation.
b. Closure of cases after complete treatment. A case is closed after revisit to their residences, and documentation of evidences for post-treatment parasite clearance time. Number of cases closed indicated completion of treatment and negative blood smear post-treatment of active surveil
-
lance around reported case (ASARC). Routine and mandated house visits in the houses of the malaria cases; contact blood smears in surround
-
ing households; identification of mosquito breed -
ing sites and their elimination were conducted.
c. Number of contact blood smears collected in fever cases around the reported case.
d. Annual blood examination rate (ABER) as an indicator for effective surveillance.
2. To assess the effectiveness of interventions.
a. Surveillance and malariometric indices: Annual Blood Examination Rate (ABER), Annual Para
-
site Incidence (API), Slide Positivity Rate (SPR), Slide Falciparum Rate (SFR), Percentage of P. fal
-
ciparum  cases (Pf%), and total number of cases 
reported.
b. All indices were compared with available manu -
ally collected data of 1  year prior to digitization (Pre-DY).
Statistical analysis
Data are represented as descriptive data, trends and Chi-square test was applied wherever appropriate using Vas
-
sarStats (vassarstats.net) analysis tool. Significance values p < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Data were analysed captured from the malaria control system software for 2  years after implementation and compared it with manual data (recorded in books and registers in written forms) for 1 year prior to digitization (pre-DY) and also in the digitization year (DY).
Reporting of cases at the point of diagnosis for their 
management by MPWs is shown in Fig.  3. Reporting 
response time was calculated as difference between date and time of diagnosis and reporting on the system. This Page 6 of 11 Baliga et al. Malar J          (2019) 18:444 
time-interval was monitored for the first 15  months 
between October 2015 and December 2016. On an aver -
age 36% of cases were reported within 24 h, 80% within 72  h and only 24% of cases were reported later than 72 h. This delay was attributed to the late reporting from smaller centres where intermittent internet services and overburden of work on some serving staff. Continued education and motivation are underway to make more efficient reporting system.
Number of cases wherein complete treatment was 
ensured, parasite clearance time was documented, and closure of each case is shown in Table  1. Closure of cases

was around 80% in the initial months after introduction 
of the software, which increased to 98% in subsequent months. In first year of digitization 11.3% of cases were untraceable which declined to 2.7% in the second year (p < 0.001).
After the introduction of TABs, active surveillance per

formed by MPWs was documented appropriately and digitally. A total of 195,009 and 176,389 house-visits were carried out during the first and second years, respectively. These visits were ascertained by GIS tracking. Active sur

the pre-digitization year (p < 0.001). ABER increased 
from 13.48 to 32.68% (r2 = 0.950); API decreased to 
10.48 from 15.51 (r2 = − 0.704); SPR from 11.5 to 3.65% 
(r2 = − 0.740) and SFR from 0.92 to 0.49% (r2 = − 0.103).
Discussion
At Mangaluru, following digitization, there was notewor -
thy change in ‘timely reporting’ behaviour of diagnosti -
cians at the point of diagnosis and may be attributed to 
ease of reporting (Fig.  3). This led to the change in strate -
gies from Early Detection and Prompt Treatment (EDPT) to Early Reporting for Complete Solutions (ERCS). ERCS includes treatment, contact blood smears (active surveil
-
lance), anti-vector measures and IEC. Time available for effective field activities also increased as a consequence of digital documentations.
Timing of interventions to break the transmission cycle 
is important and ideally any new malaria case is required to be investigated within 7  days to reduce transmission risk [ 14]. Subsequent to digitization, MPWs did work 
within the transmission period in the houses surrounding malaria cases. Instantaneous transfer of information of newly diagnosed cases to field workforce not only helped in complete treatment but also activated anti-larval/anti-mosquito measures. Case investigation was coupled with IEC in the neighbouring houses following NVB
-
DCP guidelines. Better micro management was observed among the empowered and motivated field workers.
After digitization, approach to control programme was 
made ‘incidence–centric’ i.e., ASARC. Active surveil
-
lance, contact blood smears, IEC, anti-vector measures in and around malaria positive houses were components of ASARC. Similar approach was adopted in Botswana had resulted in drastic reduction of malaria cases between 2012 and 2014 [15]. Given the enormous burden of the disease, ASARC may represent a ‘low hanging fruit strat
-
egy’ that means a relatively simpler step with larger gains in disease elimination (Fig. 4).
Improved surveillance and follow-up action has been 
successful in Sri Lanka which is declared free of indig
-
enous cases of malaria [16]. Active Surveillance is an important component in malaria control activities to reduce parasite load and the MPWs were made man

lance/contact blood smears [14]. A ‘1-3-7’ strategy was adopted that promoted the elimination process with zero indigenous malaria cases from 2017. This means that strategic action was implemented from diagnosis to treatment within 3  days and public health responses to vector management within day 7 of the case detection. After digitization there was significant increase in active blood smear collection from contacts of newly diag

Second key feature of the software is documenta

Penal action on defaulters using digitized data

the local municipality by-laws and also guidelines of NVBDCP . At the back end visits on day 1 and closure of cases on day 14 were also supervised. Penal notices were served and fines were collected from the construc

nity improved. Using the software database of large fresh water bodies namely open wells was generated and bio

logical control measures (guppy fish) were taken which also contributed in reducing spread of malaria. Such a large-scale activity is possible due to GIS-tagged track

ing, easy availability and accessibility of information on large water bodies. Introduction of fish is an effective biological method and has been successfully used in Kar
-
nataka [18]. WHO also recommends biological methods especially in water bodies to control mosquitoes [1]. All these measures contributed to reduction in malaria cases.
In India there has been a surge in urban malaria cases 
since 1970. This is largely attributed to unplanned urban
-
ization and large-scale immigration of labourers who have settled in urban slums or areas lacking basic ameni
-
ties. Migrant population, especially construction work -
ers who are at high risk for malaria infection, need to be monitored and followed-up to prevent spread of malaria [19]. In Mangaluru, after digitization almost all malarial patients were tracked till confirmation of clearance of parasites (Table  1). Accomplishment of difficult task of 
tracking migrant population was a result of easy access to case information.
At Mangaluru, previously malaria control programme 
had very little impact on incidence for over a decade and half [8, 10]. Reversal of trends in malaria after digitization 
is a result of breaking the transmission chain by: (a) quick interventional activities in the household of malaria cases; (b) high number of contact blood smears (active surveillance) collected from fever cases; (c) higher ABER; (d) effective vector control (in and around incidence/construction site/biological control measures). Improved supervision and data analysis followed by changes in local strategies also contributed.
A comprehensive disease elimination programme avail
-
able ‘everywhere’ is ideal: but this would overburden on limited health care personnel and infrastructures. It has been observed that digitization improved staff efficiency due to time saved, programme efficacy because of timely action and also brought about a ‘mandatory result’ in all cases as the software ensured mandatory documentation of steps taken to attain disease closure.
Operational/implementation research (OR/IR) is a 
key activity to improve performance of disease control programme [19]. The National Research Council (US) committee on population is of the view that success of a surveillance system rests on the availability of a func
-
tional communication and logistical infrastructure that allows for timely information transfer among all users of the system. For surveillance systems to be effective, the flow of information must occur in two directions—the data must be fed into the surveillance system and a prac
-
tical interpretation of the data must be returned to the health care workers [20]. The malaria control software has all these `systemic needs’ for elimination of malaria.
Conclusions
As per records, this is the first report of GIS-tagged com -
plete smart surveillance system to tackle urban malaria at a city-level in India. The experiences from this pro
-
gramme may have implications on other communicable diseases. Moreover, with increasing availability of big data and geographical as well as temporal trends in time, this data represents a form of artificial intelligence and machine learning which may then also harness to pre
-
dict outbreaks in terms of time and location. IT that has been harnessed in this manner for malaria eradication in Mangaluru could well have implications for disease surveillance, prevention and treatment in other parts of the world especially such countries and regions thriving malaria elimination challenges.
