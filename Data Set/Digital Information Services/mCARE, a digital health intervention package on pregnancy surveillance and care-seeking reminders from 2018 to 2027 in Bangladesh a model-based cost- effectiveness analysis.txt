ABSTRACT
Objective  W e estimated the cost-  effectiveness of a digital 
health inter
vention package (mCARE) for community health 
workers, on pregnancy surveillance and care-
 seeking 
reminders compared with the existing pa
per-
 based sta
tus 
quo, from 2018 to 2027, in Bangladesh.
Interventions
 The mCARE programme involved digitally 
enhanced pregnanc
y surveillance, individually targeted 
text messages and in-
 person home-
 visit to pregnant 
women for care-
 seeking reminders for antena
tal care, 
child delivery and postnatal care.Study design
 W
e developed a model to project population 
and service coverage increases with annual geographical expansion (from 1 million to 10 million population over 10 years) of the mCARE programme and the status quo.Major outcomes
 F
or this modelling study, we used 
Lives Saved Tool to estimate the number of deaths and disability-
 adjusted life years (DAL
Ys) that would be 
averted by 2027, if the coverage of health interventions was increased in mCARE programme and the status quo, respectively. Economic costs were captured from a societal perspective using an ingredients approach and expressed in 2018 US dollars. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken to account for parameter uncertainties.Results
 W
e estimated the mCARE programme to avert 
3076 deaths by 2027 at an incremental cost of $43
 million 
rela
tive to the status quo, which is translated to $462 
per DALY averted. The societal costs were estimated to be $115
 million for mCARE programme (48% of 
which are programme costs,
 35% user costs and 17% 
provider costs). With the continued implementation and geographical scaling-
 up,
 the mCARE programme improved 
its cost-
 effectiveness from $1152 to $462 per DAL
Y 
averted from 5 to 10 years.Conclusion
 Mobile phone-
 based pregnanc
y surveillance 
systems with individually scheduled text messages and home-
 visit reminder stra
tegies can be highly cost-
 effective 
in Bangladesh.
 The cost-
 effectiveness may improve as it 
promotes facility-
 based child deliver
y and achieves greater 
programme cost efficiency with programme scale and sustainability.INTRODUCTION
Bangladesh is the eighth most populous country in the world with 165
 million people, 
and accounts a maternal mortality ratio of 173 per 100
 000 live births,1 74 000 newborn 
deaths2and 83  000 stillbirths3 each year. Many 
maternal and neonatal deaths can be averted using evidence-
 based inter
ventions such 
as use of antenatal care (ANC) and timely access to healthcare. In many low-
 income 
and middle-
 income countries, however
, 
coverage levels of these interventions are still low. Despite the substantial progress over the last few decades, Bangladesh still has the lowest coverage of these interventions (eg, Strengths and limitations of this study

21% of pregnant women attend at least four ANC visits 
and 31% have skilled birth attendants) among its South Asian neighbours.
4 5 Improving maternal and newborn 
health (MNH) remains an essential health priority for Bangladesh.
6
Over the recent decade, mHealth (ie, defined as 
use of mobile and wireless technologies to support the achievement of health objectives)
7 has been widely used 
to improve health outcomes, service access and quality of essential MNH services.
8 9 Several studies demonstrated 
the positive impact of mHealth in resource-
 limited 
settings.10 11 These included an increase in the use of ANC 
from 10% to 37% in southern India,12 four or more ANC 
visits (OR 3.21, 95%
 CI 1.73 to 5.98) in South Africa13 
after introduction of text messages for health promotion, and a significant increase in the coverage of skilled birth attendants (11%), facility delivery (10%) and measles immunisation (6%) in Ghana.
14 Use of mHealth also 
increased knowledge retention of health workers about the identification of danger signs during pregnancy, after delivery and among newborns and children in low-
 
income and middle-
 income countries.15
Under these circumstances, a wide array of digital 
health solutions have been piloted throughout the last few decades in Bangladesh,
16 including telemedicine, 
short message service (SMS) advice for safe pregnancy and use of the mobile phone as a data collection tool
17 to 
improve access and quality of service delivery of essential MNH services.
18 However, few of these successfully piloted 
innovations have been scaled nationwide sustainably.19–21 
Studies acknowledge that this persistent challenge is partly due to a lack of evidence on the value for money of mHealth programmes in MNH services, how to build capacity in countries and what resources are needed.
22
The mCARE-  I research project, implemented from 
2011 to 2015, tested a package of mHealth inter
ven-
tions to support community health workers (CHWs) on pregnancy surveillance activities and to promote care-
 
seeking 
behaviours to pregnant women and their fami-
lies in the Gaibandha district in northern Bangladesh. A previous cost-
 effectiveness study estimated that using SMS 
reminders for ANC care-
 seeking was highly cost-
 effective 
with an estimate of $31 per disability-
 adjusted life year 
(DAL
Y) averted.23 To further promote a large scale-  up of 
the promising intervention, the objective of this study is to assess the cost-
 effectiveness of the mCARE programme, 
compared with the current paper
-
 based status quo, over a 
10-
 year analytic time horizon (2018–2027) to help guide 
investment decisions and to promote large-
 scale use and 
sustainability of mHealth inter
vention.
METHODSStudy settingGaibandha district is one of the 64 districts in Bangla-desh which consists of approximately 15.8
 million people 
(6249 
square miles). The coverage for MNH services is 
31% for four or more ANC visits, 38% for facility delivery and 36% for postnatal care (PNC), which compares favourably with national estimates.
24 The literacy rate is 
46% in Gaibandha,25 which are lower than the national 
literacy rate as 75% and primary education completion rate as 68% in Bangladesh.
26
InterventionIn this analysis, we consider three comparators and their associated programmatic activities: (1) the comprehen-sive mCARE programme involves a digital intervention package with both supply-
 side and demand-
 side promo
-
tion components. This includes pregnancy surveillance using a mobile phone-
 based system by government CHWs 
(family welfare assistants) and automated SMS and CHW home-
 visit reminders to pregnant women sent before 
individually scheduled ANC 1–4 dates; (2) the basic mCARE 
package involves only on the supply-
 side 
promo-
tion component which is pregnancy surveillance using a mobile phone-
 based system by the government CHWs; 
and (3) the status 
quo involves paper-
 based 
pregnancy 
surveillance and existing community-
 based ANC promo
-
tion activities to pregnant women by the government CHWs.
Model
We developed a model that can estimate the annual target population as the number of pregnant women, population coverage (as the number of pregnant women who were registered in the programme through census enumeration and pregnancy surveillance) and service coverage (as the number of pregnant women who sought care, over the number of registered pregnant women in the system) from 2018 to 2027 (online supplemental appendix figure S1). For simplicity, we assumed a hypo-thetical 1
 million population per district and incremental 
scale-
 up of the inter
vention to additional districts each 
year for upto 10 districts over a 10-
 year time horizon 
(ie, step-
 wedge scale-
 up). For a target population (ie, 
pregnant 
women), the number of pregnant women per 
district27 was calculated based on the proportional ratio of 
number of married women of reproductive age (MWRA), aged 15–49 years, in Gaibandha district (24%),
28 fertility 
rate (ie, 66 births per 1000 MWRA),29 abortion rate (ie, 
29 per 1000 pregnant women)30 and fetal loss rate (ie, 28 
per 1000 births).31 Similarly, we estimated the number of 
CHWs per district based on the average ratio (ie, 1 CHW for identifying and managing about 30 pregnant women per year in their catchment area) that we obtained from the interview with local public health managers and reviewed by local experts in Gaibandha district (online supplemental appendix tables S1 and S2).
Population coverage
As a measure of workforce performance efficiency in pregnancy surveillance, emphasis is placed on to what extent mCARE system can improve existing productivity and operational efficiency compared with paper-
 based 
system. 
We focused on the incremental increases in the by copyright. on December 17, 2022 at Sri Lanka:BMJ-PG Sponsored. Protected http://bmjopen.bmj.com/ BMJ Open: first published as 10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042553 on 1 April 2021. Downloaded from 3

number of household visits per day by a CHW within 
a feasible range of the CHW’s existing capacity (eg, an average 30 household visits per CHW per day). With improved workforce efficiency, we assumed the mCARE system would enrol 90% of the target population (total number of pregnant women) through census enumera-tion and pregnancy surveillance, while the paper-
 based 
system would capture 80% of the target population over the year in each district based on the inter
views with rele-
vant local stakeholders (table
 
1).
Service coverageService coverage represents a measure of the pregnant woman’s care-
 seeking to essential maternal and newborn 
care ser
vices during pregnancy, childbirth and postnatal 
periods. Until further data become available, we took the assumptions of the annual coverage increase rate for each scenario from baseline to the target year as plausible esti-mates for expansion: 10% for ANC and PNC and 5% for child delivery for the comprehensive mCARE programme, 5% and 2.5% for the basic mCARE programme, and 1% and 0.5% for the paper-
 system, 
respectively, based on 
empirical and published data.32 For example, the trends 
of ANC coverage from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey revealed an increase from 58% in 2004 to 88% in 2014 with a 3%–5%
 annual coverage increase 
rate.24 A quasi-  experimental evaluation of the pilot project 
suggests 
that the comprehensive mCARE programme was 
associated with a 2.6 times increase in the use of ANC and a 1.6 times increase in PNC
32 compared with the baseline. 
Consequently, our coverage increase rates assumption similarly resulted in a 2.4 times coverage increase of ANC and PNC using the comprehensive mCARE programme, 1.6 times increase with the basic mCARE programme and 1.1 times increase in coverage for the status quo, from the respective baseline values in 2018 to 2027. Since child delivery service is the most resource-
 intensive care, the 
annual increase rates of skilled birth attendance and facility deliver
y were adjusted to half of ANC and PNC 
services increase rates to account for limited health system capacity (online supplemental appendix table S3).
Health outcome
The Lives Saved Tool (LiST) V.5.761
33 was then used 
to generate estimates of the incremental numbers of lives saved based on the respective incremental service coverage increases for ANC, child delivery and PNC for each scenario (online supplemental appendix table S3). We did not include immunisation as the coverage levels were already high (>95%) in Bangladesh in 2018. Based on country-
 wide demographics, efficacy
 
and coverage data,33 LiST produced projections of the 
annual number of lives saved for mothers, stillbirths and newborns from 2018 to 2027. Considering the incre-mental geographical expansion over time, we propor -
tionally adjusted the annual number of lives saved based on the increased target population size in the given year implemented by each scenario. We calculated DALYs based on the number of lives saved
29 34 35 and the life 
table in Bangladesh,36 assuming life expectancy as 72 
years for the newborn and 30 years for mothers with 
an annual 3% discount rate (resulting in 27 DALYs per mother’s death and 30 DALYs per newborn/stillbirth death). Due to the lack of morbidity data, years lived with disability were not included in the DALY calcula-tion and were expected to make a marginal change to the total DALY measure.
37
Societal costsEconomic costs were measured from a societal perspec-tive including programmes, health systems and user costs over the 10-
 year time horizon.38 We estimated programme  
costs based on an ingredients approach. For each scenario, we identified detailed activity lists (eg, system optimisa-tion, training and implementation) and collected rele-vant cost information (eg, salary and level of effort for activities) from the interview with government health providers and local experts in the Gaibandha district
23 
(online supplemental appendix tables S1 and S2) and the previously published study
23 based on the mCARE-1 
pilot study from 2012 to 2015. These costs were combined with relevant estimates of number of pregnant women, population coverage and service coverage for each scenario to calculate total programme, provider and user costs (tables
 
1 and 2). We assumed certain activity and 
capital costs such as system optimisation to occur only in the first year one time for all districts for the mCARE programme, while census enumeration to occur only in the first year in each district in both the mCARE programme and the status quo. All other activities and associated costs were accounted for each year and each district with annual geographical expansion. All costs were adjusted to 2018 US dollars based on gross domestic product (GDP) deflator, discounted at an annual rate of 3%,
39 and capital costs were annualised based on their 
life expectancy.
We estimated health system costs based on the provid-
er’s salary and time consumed for providing a service, as well as commodity consumption (eg, micronutrients or vitamin A) stemming from the use of health services for ANC, child delivery and PNC. Costs to expand or upgrade infrastructure related to these interventions were not included. We calculated user costs including direct and indirect costs for seeking care during ANC, facility or home deliveries and PNC. Direct user costs were any expenses spent to seek care, including round-
 trip trans
-
portation costs, fees for service, medical tests or drugs. Indirect user costs were calculated from opportunity costs that were foregone due to care-
 seeking 
such as wages lost 
by care-
 seeking from the total time of round-
 trip trans
-
portation, waiting, consultation and treatment. These data were obtained from a previously published study

Sensitivity analyses
To test the robustness of our cost-
 effectiveness outcome 
estimates between the comprehensive mCARE system and the status quo, we per
formed a series of sensitivity 
analyses (one-
 way
, three-
 way and probabilistic sensitivity 
analysis (PSA)). Parameter uncertainty ranges were determined based on primar
y data and financial records 
for the costs, and informant interviews for the service coverage parameters (table
 
1). The three-
 way sensitivity 
analysis 
was performed based on the three most influen-
tial parameters identified by the one-
 way sensitivity anal
-
ysis. For PSA, all model parameter values were randomly sampled over 10
 000 iterative Monte Carlo simulations 
based on pre-
 specified distributions of each data param
-
eter to generate 95% uncertainty ranges around our primary cost-
 effectiveness estimate. The incremental 
cost-
 effectiveness ratio (ICER) estimates were evaluated 
against different willingness-
 to-
 pay thresholds repre
-
senting a range of financial and budgetary constraints in Bangladesh for public health interventions (eg, GDP per capita).
41
Patient and public involvementPatients or the public were not involved in the design, or conduct, or reporting or dissemination plans of our research.
RESULTS
CostsOur model estimated that the comprehensive mCARE programme would require a total of $115
 million 
by 2027 
(including $55
 million in programme costs, $40
 million 
in user costs and $20
 million in provider costs), which is 
an increment of $19
 million, compared with the mCARE 
basic programme, and $43
 million compared with the 
status quo. In the comprehensive mCARE programme, the 
major programme cost makeup consisted of pregnancy surveillance (19%), training (18%) and super -
vision (16%) (table
 
1).
EffectivenessWith annual service coverage increase with geographical expansion over 10 years, a total of 3324 estimated lives (uncertainty range (UR): 1777–4871) would be saved, including 1745 neonatal deaths (UR: 1040–2451), 1451 stillbirths (UR: 683–2219) and 127 maternal deaths (UR: 54–201) in the comprehensive mCARE programme. This is about two times greater than the basic mCARE programme (1361 lives, UR: 1005–1718), and 13 times greater than the status quo (248 lives, UR: 179–316), resulting in an increment of 1962 (UR: 772–3153) and 3076 (UR: 1598–4555) deaths averted compared with the basic mCARE programme and the status quo. Based on the LiST model outputs, labour and delivery management was the major intervention saving lives (27% for neonatal, 37% for maternal and 93% for stillbirth), and the major causes of deaths were sepsis for newborns (41%), intra-partum for stillbirths (97%) and hypertensive disorder for maternal lives (46%).
Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio
We estimated the incremental cost-
 effectiveness of the 
comprehensive mCARE programme as $9684 and $13
 979 
per death averted compared with the basic mCARE programme 
and the status quo, respectively (table
 2
). 
This translated into an estimated $327 and $462 per DALY averted compared with the basic mCARE programme and the status quo. With the continued implementation and geographical scaling-
 up, the model estimated that cost-
 
effectiveness of the mCARE programme may improve from $1152 to $462 per DAL
Y averted over 5 to 10 years 
compared with the status quo.

delivery between facility and community levels, followed 
by the programme costs and population coverage in the mCARE system (figure
 
1). Our model showed that 
the lower population and service coverage reduce the ICER (more cost-
 effective) 
as they influenced reducing 
the intervention costs more than deaths averted. In the three-
 way sensitivity analysis (
figure
 
2), we found that the 
cost-
 effectiveness of mCARE programme can improve 
almost 
sevenfold from $1287 to $172 per DALY averted at 
child delivery at facility level, a lower mCARE programme cost and a lower population coverage (lower number of pregnancies registered, resulting in lower societal costs due to reduced care-
 seeking). The results of the PSA, 
displayed in the cost-
 effectiveness acceptability cur
ves, 
show the probability of the intervention being cost-
 
effective under different willingness-
 to-
 pay thresholds 
(
figure
 
3). At a priori willingness-
 to-
 pay threshold of 
$1000 per DAL
Y averted, for example, the comprehensive mCARE programme was 50% cost-  effective compared 
with the status quo over 5
 years, 96% over 8
 years and 
100% over 10 years of implementation; 
at a willingness-
 
to-
 pay 
threshold of $1700 per DALY averted (Bangladesh 
GDP per capita in 2018), all scenarios were almost 100% 
cost-
 effective relative to the status quo.
DISCUSSIONFrom a societal perspective, we estimated that the digital health inter
vention on pregnancy surveillance and care-
 
seeking promotion can be cost-
 effective relative to the 
paper
-
 based status quo at $416 per DAL
Y averted with 
incremental geographical scale-
 up over 10 years (2018–
2027) upto 10
 million population in Bangladesh. Key 
drivers of cost-
 effectiveness were number of lives saved 
for child deliver
y between facility and community levels, 
followed by the programme costs and population coverage Table 2  Summary of costs, health outcome and incr emental cost-  ef fectiveness ratios of the three scenarios: (1)

in the mCARE system. The cost-  effectiveness improves 
from $1152 to $462 per DALY averted from 5 to 10 years 
with the continued implementation and geographical scaling-
 up, despite of additional capital costs for popula
-
tion registration and training required.
Our study finding highlights that the cost-
 effectiveness 
of 
mHealth programmes are setting-
 specific 
and likely to 
change over time and scale. The three-
 way sensitivity anal
-
ysis illustrates that cost-
 effectiveness 
of the mCARE system 
can be as low as $172 per DALY averted in the settings (eg, urban) with high health system capacity and care-
 seeking 
for facility-
 based child deliveries, lower programme costs 
(due in part to high population density) and lower popu
-
lation coverage (due in part to wide-
 spread family plan
-
ning programmes), compared with the settings in a rural/hard-
 to-
 reach areas ($1287 per DAL
Y averted). In other 
words, while mCARE programme is expected to improve population and service coverage, the programme may end-
 up suboptimal cost-
 effectiveness with greater societal 
costs compared with the status quo, unless the increased care-
 seeking results in greater lives saving through high-
 
quality 
service especially at child delivery. Nevertheless, 
the extent of plausible ICER changes is still under Bangla-desh GDP per capita ($1700 in 2018), suggesting that mCARE programme would be considered cost-
 effective 
in a variety of health system settings.Compared with the previous studies on mHealth appli
-
cation (as a job aid for CHWs for pregnancy surveil-
lance and health promotion for essential maternal and newborn healthcare services), our study shows a higher ICER estimate of $462 per DALY averted from a soci-etal perspective (from $1152 to $462 per DALY averted over 5 to 10 years) in Bangladesh. Prinja et al
42 estimated 
the cost savings ($90 per DALY averted) from a societal perspective and $205 per DALY averted over 10 years from a health system perspective in India, accounting a trade-
 off relationship between preventive and curative 
ser
vice use induced by mHealth intervention (ie, greater 
preventive care-
 seeking contributes to less illness and 
less curative care-
 seeking). Willcox 
et al14 and LeFevre 
et al13 estimated $174 to $7 per DALY averted in Ghana 
from 1 to 10 years from a programme perspective and $1985 to $200 per DALY averted in South Africa from 1 to 5
 years from the societal perspective, with continued 
implementation and an increasing number of beneficia
-
ries over time. Our ICER value is moderately higher than the previous findings as we incorporated a geographical expansion scenario which required additional capital cost investment in any new district. Furthermore, while we included considerable user costs incurred by increased

 seeking scenario (ie, all incr

of child delivery to be occurred by skilled health attendants in the home/community level rather than obstetric care clinics), the ICER increases from the base value of $462 to $889, suggesting that the mCARE programme becomes less cost-

care-  seeking by the inter vention, we did not include lives 
saved for children older than 1
 year in the LiST model
-
ling. We also did not consider a potential trade-
 off rela
-
tionship between prevention and curative care (which 
may decrease societal costs) due to limited data to define those distant and dynamic consequences.
Our model-
 based cost-
 effectiveness analysis shows a 
greater ICER ($462 vs $31 per DAL
Y averted), compared 
with the previous cost-
 effective analysis on the mCARE 
program23 because of the different study perspectives, 
comparison groups, size of target population, and cost inputs and effectiveness estimations between the two studies. First, we compared mCARE system versus paper-
 
based status quo (and thus incremental cost incurred from total mCARE programme costs as well as provider and user costs relative to paper
-
 based status quo), while 
the previous study compared mCARE comprehensive versus basic programmes implemented from 2011 to 2015 in Gaibandha. Second, we constructed a hypothetical cohort 
and annual geographical expansion scenario upto 
10
 million population over 10 years (assuming 1 million 
population and 15
 000 pregnant women per district), 
while the 
previous study is based on 610 pregnant women 
enrolled from the observed data. All these contributed to far greater incremental costs and thus a higher ICER value in this model-
 based analysis compared with those 
from the previous study
.
Our study has some limitations. First, there were limited 
empirical data and existing practice or evidence of a large scaled-
 up mHealth programme in pregnancy sur
veillance 
and care-
 seeking reminders. W
e therefore evaluated cost-
 
effectiveness with estimates drawn from obser
ved data 
and a range of assumptions regarding the population and service coverage metrics using LiST to forecast health impact and costs. Future studies could also assess what specific aspects of scale-
 up (either geographical expan
-
sion vs sustainability) drives economies of scale more substantially to improve cost-
 effectiveness, whether or 
how nonlinear coverage increase to be obser ved by setting 
specific conditions, how or to what extent health system capacity and care-
 seeking influence ser
vice coverage 
and costs with empiric data and implementations, when approrpriate. Second, our model does not incorporate detailed complexities between preventive and curative care; while mCARE system may result in a more preven-tive care during pregnancy and thus less illness at delivery and less demand for curative care, the status quo with lower uptake of preventive care may result in more illness in the population and induce more demand for curative care. However, increased demand for curative care by sicker patients may avert fewer deaths than intended in the status quo. Overall, we think the trade-
 off relation
-
ship between preventive care-
 seeking 
and curative care 
has marginal effects on the incremental health outcome between the mCARE and status quo groups, and there-fore may not change our final conclusion. Third, as many other studies use LiST,
43–45 we linearly interpolated the 
level of service coverage from baseline to the target year

for each scenario. Considering government-  led scale-  up 
in mind, our goal is to compare the relative impact of 
the mCARE programme to the paper
-
 based status quo 
(rather 
to accurately project the coverage increase) under 
feasible scale-
 up implementation scenarios. Our findings 
thus intend to directly inform policy questions relating to determine the key drivers and enabling conditions to improve cost-
 effectiveness of a digital health programme 
in pregnancy sur
veillance and care-
 seeking promotion 
to help implementation planning and investment deci
-
sion with pragmatic financial estimations. Nonetheless, it is important to acknowledge that the effectiveness of mHealth programmes is influenced by a series of setting-
 
specific conditions,46 including literacy and education, 
geographical and financial access to health facilities, social and cultural norms, and women’s access to infor -
mation technology, number of available and trained CHWs and the quality or capacity of major MNH service provision agencies.
47–49 Strength of our system and inter -
vention strategy on this aspect is that the server system sends automated SMS to both pregnant women and CHWs and thus CHWs can make personal home visits to the pregnant women’s houses to remind and check their ANC care-
 seeking. This feature allowed more equi
-
table access to care as the pregnant women could receive care-
 sceeking stimuli by CHWs at least regardless of their 
mobile 
phone ownership and literacy or education levels.
Given that pregnancy surveillance and training are the 
major programme cost drivers, cost-
 sharing 
might also be 
a useful strategy to pursue with other public agencies and programmes, such as Civil Registration and Vital Statistics initiatives. We recognise that headcount-
 based denom
-
inators are rare in most low-
 resource health systems, 
despite the importance of a well-
 defined population to 
ensure ‘universal’ health coverage.50 A well-  established 
community-
 based pregnancy sur
veillance system using 
a mHealth platform linked to primary health service delivery can serve as a powerful source to create new incentives and value-
 added ser
vices for local businesses 
throughout the continuum of care among various health system stakeholders. Furthermore, as we found most lives saved occurred through effective intervention during child delivery, SMS and home-
 visit reminder inter
ven-
tion can be strategically focused on promoting child delivery at a facility level (eg, educating family members, and mobilising funds for child delivery). In parallel, as facilities and staffing are generally under-
 resourced 
in 
many developing countries, plans for scaling-
 up primar
y 
health services (eg, additional recruitment or training of CHWs, upgrading health facilities or health information systems) should be taken into account as it may be more important to ensure health system preparedness to meet the expected service needs and demands.

CONCLUSIONIn this study, we estimated that the digital health inter -
vention on pregnancy surveillance and care-
 seeking promotion can be cost-
 effective relative to the paper

status quo at $416 per DAL

geographical scale-
 up over 10 years upto 10
