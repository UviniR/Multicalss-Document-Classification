Abstr act
Backgr ound: Despite the development of effective drugs for treatment, tuberculosis remains one of the leading causes of death
from an infectious disease worldwide. One of the greatest challenges to tuberculosis control is patient adherence to treatment.
Recent research has shown that video-based directly observ ed therap y is a feasible and effective approach to supporting treatment
adherence in high-income settings. However, few studies have explored the potential for such a solution in a low- or middle-income
country setting. Globally , these countries’ rapidly rising rate of mobile penetration suggests that the potential for translation of
these results may be high.
Objecti ve: We sought to examine patient perceptions related to the use of mobile health, and specif ically video-based directly
observ ed therap y, in a previously unstudied patient demographic: patients with tuberculosis in a low-income country setting
(Cambodia).
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional qualitati ve study in urban and periurban areas in Cambodia, consisting of 6 focus
groups with tuberculosis patients who were recei ving treatment (standard directly observ ed therap y) through a nongo vernmental
organization.
Results: Familiarity with mobile technology and apps was widespread in this population, and overall willingness to consider a
mobile app for video-based directly observ ed therap y was high. However, we identif ied potential challenges. First, patients very
much valued their frequent in-person interactions with their health care provider , which may be reduced with the video-based
directly observ ed therap y interv ention. Second, there may be technical issues to address, including how to make the app suitable
for illiterate participants.
Conclusions: While video-based directly observ ed therap y is a promising technology , even in country settings where mobile
penetration is reportedly almost universal, it should be introduced with caution. However, the results were generally promising
and yielded important insights that not only will be translated into the further adaptation of key features of video-based directly
observ ed therap y for tuberculosis patients in Cambodia, but also can inform the future design and successful implementation of
video-based directly observ ed therap y interv entions in low- and middle-income settings more generally .

Introduction
Backgr ound
Despite the development of effective drugs for treatment,
tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the leading causes of death
from an infectious disease worldwide [1]. One of the greatest
challenges to TB control is patient adherence to treatment: the
need to take drugs daily for 6 months often proves too
burdensome, leading to late initiation (treatment delay),
disruption (missed treatment), or early termination (treatment
default). Nonadherence prolongs the period of infecti vity,
potentiates relapse, and contrib utes to the emer gence of
multidrug-resistant TB cases every year [2].
Conventional directly observ ed therap y (DOT; the standard TB
care whereby patients are strictly monitored daily over the
course of their treatment, either by a health care worker or by
trained community or family members [3]) faces signif icant
implementation challenges. For patients and their households,
adherence entails continuing nonpecuniary costs even when TB
drugs themselv es are free, including physical side effects,
foregone producti ve time, travel costs, social stigma, and
potential affront to autonomy [3]. Reliance on in-person
interactions for oversight and support, particularly in
resource-poor settings where patients are geographically isolated
and hard to reach, is another persistent difficulty .
To address these challenges, numerous adherence-enhancement
strate gies based on DOT have been tried. Interv entions that aim
to enhance adherence (eg, reminder systems, defaulter action,
education, and peer assistance) without addressing the
underlying incenti ve problem have either shown mixed results
or suggested that more high-quality conte xt-specif ic evidence
is needed [4,5]. Studies of financial incenti ves, however, have
shown that patients recei ving material rewards are signif icantly
more likely to complete TB treatment [6,7], although these
findings were mostly obtained in developed country settings.
With the spread of mobile technology , TB stakeholders are also
increasingly eager to explore mobile health (mHealth) solutions
to overcoming these constraints [8,9]. The simplest and most
widely available approach is the use of text messages or apps
to provide support or reminders. However, in the case of TB,
use of text message reminders in low- and middle-income
country (LMIC) populations has had limited effectiveness
[10,11]. More sophisticated interv entions, such as smart pills
and electronic pill boxes, have been explored and some have
shown promise, but practical apps suited to public TB control
programs in LMICs are still limited [12-18].
Video-based DOT (VDO T) apps are another mHealth solution
that can be integrated into a model of care. By leveraging the
ability to take and share videos, VDO T platforms offer a wide
range of interv ention approaches beyond reminders alone,
enhancing monitoring and support by allowing patients to record
and send videos of themselv es taking medication and enablingnew modes of communication with health workers. If successful,
such apps would reduce ongoing labor and transport costs by
eliminating the need for health workers to travel to patients’
homes and allowing patients to take the drugs daily when
convenient, further reducing patient opportunity costs. VDO T
has already been shown to be effective in increasing adherence
in some high-income country settings [19-25]. However, few
studies have explored the potential for such a solution in an
LMIC setting; where studies exist (eg, in India, Vietnam, Kenya,
and Uganda) they show promise terms of feasibility and
acceptability [15,26-29]. Globally , these countries’ rapidly rising
rate of mobile penetration suggests that the potential for
translation of these results may be high, but at the same time,
the speed of such development may result in new and
unanticipated challenges.
Objecti ve
In this conte xt, we sought to examine patient perceptions of
issues relevant to the use of mHealth, specif ically percei ved
barriers to treatment adherence, current experience with mobile
phone features, and acceptability of VDO T and mobile cash
transfers, in a previously unstudied patient demographic: TB
patients in a low-income country setting under going rapid
expansion of mobile penetration. Ultimately , the study aimed
specif ically to inform the future implementation of an mHealth
platform to support TB treatment adherence in this population
in Cambodia and, more generally , to highlight considerations
when planning and developing such an interv ention.
Methods
Setting
Our study location, Cambodia, presents a unique opportunity ,
with a high prevalence of TB, declining TB treatment
completion, and increased mobile phone penetration.
Approximately two-thirds of all Cambodians carry the TB
bacterium, one of the highest rates in the world. DOT can be a
challenge for the 80% of the population that lives in rural
communities with poor roads and difficult access, served by a
mix of health care workers and DOT volunteers. Although
Cambodia has maintained outstanding national average
treatment success rates of over 90% for well over a decade,
disturbing overall trends and subnational disparities have
emer ged. Since 2009, treatment success and completion rates
have declined steadily . Rising rates of drug-resistant TB also
indicate that poor adherence may be a concern [30].
Regarding mobile phone penetration, in 2019 there were more
mobile phones than people in Cambodia, with more than half
the population owning smartphones [7]. This is an increase of
30% over the previous year, a trend that is likely to expand in
the lower-income segments of the population, supported by
continued declines in prices, as well as the recent introduction
of Khmer -language support and system translation for Android
version 4.4 and higher (previously available on Nokia and

RenderXiPhone only). These conditions suggest a large and growing
opportunity for mHealth to impro ve monitoring and
enhancement.
Study Design
We conducted a cross-sectional qualitati ve study in urban and
periurban areas of Cambodia, with the support of Operation
ASHA, a nongo vernmental organization providing TB treatment
and other health services to low-income communities in
Cambodia and other Asian countries. Operation ASHA ’s
community health workers visit patients in their homes every
day during the first (intensi ve) phase of treatment and once
weekly during the second (continuous) phase, with patients
self-administering the drug the rest of the week.
We conducted 6 focus groups with TB patients being served by
Operation ASHA: 3 groups in Phnom Penh (an urban setting)
and 3 in Takeo (a semirural province). We determined the
number of focus groups using a rule of thumb typically cited
in the qualitati ve literature, namely , that 2 to 5 groups are
required per category of participants. Because we had 2 locations
(urban and periurban) and for logistical reasons limiting a greater
number of focus groups, we settled on 3 groups per location.
We recruited 12 participants per group to ensure a minimum of
8 assuming some attrition; ultimately , each group had between
10 and 12 participants. The 2 areas have similar rates of
smear -positi ve results, at around 9% [31].
Participants
Study participants were men and women aged 18 years and
older who had a diagnosis of TB and were currently recei ving
treatment from Operation ASHA, and who were physically able
to travel to Operation ASHA local headquarters. Participants
were recruited by Operation ASHA staff using the recruitment
script developed by the research team and appro ved by the
institutional review board of the University of Southern
California, Los Angeles, CA, USA, which also covers Operation
ASHA ’s Cambodia work by an agreement of deferral for this
study . All participants in the study were assured of
confidentiality and anon ymity and all identif iers have been
remo ved to protect participant confidentiality . Participants
provided oral informed consent, including for audiotaping and
transcription, both during recruitment and at the start of the
discussion. As a token of appreciation, participants recei ved a
US $10 cash incenti ve for participation. Participants who did
not or were unwilling to provide informed consent were
excluded from the study .
Instruments
A semistructured discussion protocol was designed by the lead
author with qualitati ve research expertise (LR) to collect
information on patient perceptions of adherence and mHealth
interv entions in general, as well as to inform the development
of a mobile VDO T interv ention to support TB treatment
adherence. Issues for discussion included percei ved barriers to
treatment adherence, views on mHealth, and the acceptability
of a potential VDO T approach to treatment. The protocol further
focused on general issues related to basic features of a VDO T
system: (1) sending and recei ving text messages, (2) taking and
sending videos, and (3) providing incenti ves via cash or mobilepayments as incenti ves for treatment adherence. We pilot tested
the instrument in the first focus group, after which we made
minor amendments (primarily clarifying certain questions) for
the subsequent groups.
Participants were also asked to assess an existing VDO T app
developed by members of the study team (NIJP , JSM, WTO)
and asked to evaluate the usability of such an app [32,33]. To
avoid priming participants, we presented them with a short
description of this VDO T mHealth app only after the general
discussion about mobile phone ownership and current use. Users
of this platform are provided with a personalized pill schedule
that is monitored via the VDO T app. Using the VDO T mobile
app, users are able to take a video of themselv es taking their
medication daily and upload the recorded video for a review by
their health worker, together with a report of any adverse effects
from the day before. Other features include a color -coded
calendar indicating video submission and appro val status by
day, a function for explaining reasons for missing entries, and
a messaging function for communication with the health worker.
We also showed participants printouts of what the various
screens of the app would look like. We then solicited
impressions of the app, including their interest in such an
approach, and concerns about its introduction.
We designed a short survey to collect background information
prior to the focus group discussion. The questionnaire included
questions on demographic and socioeconomic status to provide
a complete picture of the background characteristics of our
sample. All instruments and the screenshots of the VDO T app
were prepared in English, translated into Khmer by bilingual
translators, reviewed by an experienced local physician, and
further refined where required.
Data Collection
We conducted all focus groups in July 2018. The focus groups
were held in private meeting rooms within Operation ASHA ’s
health facilities in both study locations and facilitated by a
moderator and note taker, both of whom were bilingual native
Khmer speak ers locally hired and trained in study protocols,
facilitation methods, and data capture by 2 study leads (JY and
LR). All groups were facilitated in Khmer with only the
moderator , note taker, and 1 researcher from the University of
Southern California present during the discussion. Discussions
lasted approximately 90 minutes and were recorded with
permission, transcribed verbatim, and translated into English
for analysis.
Coding and Analysis
We conducted a thematic analysis, in which we coded transcripts
using a deducti ve approach, with codes generated from a review
of the transcripts and the study’ s research questions and aims.
This approach aimed to unco ver the key themes and the most
signif icant messages inherent in the raw data [34]. Where
needed, the resulting codes were organized into broader ,
overarching categories. All transcripts were coded by the lead
author (LR) using the final version of the codebook. We used
the qualitati ve data analysis softw are ATLAS.ti version 8.4.4
(1135) (ATLAS.ti Scientif ic Softw are Development GmbH) to
support the organization, review, and coding of the raw data.

RenderXResults
Sample Characteristics
We recruited 64 adults recei ving TB treatment from Operation
ASHA into our study . The sample comprised 34 men and 30
women with a median age of 55 years. The majority (n=44)
were married, and 10 were wido wed. This is broadly in line
with available statistics on TB patients: in the most recently
available Cambodian national TB prevalence survey, those aged
45 years or older accounted for 75% of smear -positi ve TB and
63% of smear -negative, culture-positi ve TB cases identif ied,
with more males than females having smear -positi ve and
smear -negative, culture-positi ve TB [35]. Educational attainment
was generally low, with 19% (12/64) having no education, 53%
(34/64) having an elementary school education, and the rest
(18/64, 28%) having either lower or upper secondary education.
No one in our sample had any tertiary education. While data
are limited on the educational background of TB patients, these
numbers show that our sample had overall lower educational
attainment than the national population: in 2017, 19% of
Cambodians aged 25 years and older reported having no or less
than primary education, and 6% reported tertiary education [36].
In our own sample, almost half of participants required
assistance from the research staff to complete the paper -based
prefocus group questionnaire.
In terms of labor force participation, less than half our sample
(29/64) were emplo yed full-time, and 31% were not working
at all (20/64). The rest were working part-time (8/64), retired
(n=3), or students (n=1). Our sample differed from the general
population in this respect: in 2018, labor force participation for
all adults aged 15 years and older was estimated at 85% [37].
This difference is likely a function of at least both the median
age of our sample (55 years) and the fact that they were all TB
patients in treatment.
Regarding TB treatment, 61% (39/64) of our participants had
begun their TB treatment less than 4 months previously , with
the rest (n=25) in treatment for 5 months or longer .
Reported Adher ence to TB Treatment
In addition to basic sociodemographic information, the
questionnaire asked participants about their experience with TB
treatment, and their mobile phone ownership and use. The vast
majority of our participants reported never having missed any
of their medication (55/64, 86%); this is likely because
Operation ASHA makes home visits. However, these home
visits are not uniformly performed daily [2]: most reported
seeing their health worker as part of their TB treatment only
once a week (35/64, 55%) or less (n=7, 11%); the rest (n=22,
35%) reported seeing their health worker twice or more a week.
Our focus group discussions revolved around 3 main themes
that would inform the rollout of a VDO T interv ention in
Cambodia: (1) challenges to TB treatment adherence, (2)
familiarity with and likely acceptability of features of such a
platform, and (3) recepti veness to an mHealth app to support
treatment, including use of appropriate cash incenti ves. We
discuss our findings in detail below and provide translated directquotations to illustrate participants’ views of these different
themes.
Challenges to Treatment Adher ence
As expected, participants agreed that access to treatment itself
had been easy for them because Operation ASHA provides
treatment free of charge and through home visits. Across the
groups, participants expressed high levels of satisf action with
the existing Operation ASHA model of home visits:
I speak truly, there is no difficulty [adhering to
treatment]. The medicine , they bring it home; [when
it] runs out, they bring [mor e] home .[Female, focus
group 5]
It was not difficult like befor e, [when] we took the
medicine at the doctor’ s place . Now they bring the
medicine to our home .[Male, focus group 2]
[For] some patients [it is] difficult to travel to the
health center , so now we [have] home-based service ,
it’s [easier] for patients. [Female, focus group 3]
Participants tended to highlight the practical benef its of the
home visits more than they did the financial benef it of
medications for which they did not have to pay out of pock et.
Issues of stigma and privacy regarding an individual’ s TB and
treatment status were not reported as signif icant concerns, even
in the conte xt of recei ving a health care worker at home. In
addition, there was widespread agreement that home visits not
only were more convenient, but also enabled the health care
provider to provide the encouragement, reassurance, and support
that patients needed to adhere to the treatment, especially in the
difficult first 2 months:
The doctor in charge of TB is very helpful. He is very
attentive to patients. When I was on treatment he
would come in every day to make sure I wouldn’ t miss
[any dose of] my treatment. I would have missed my
treatment if he didn’ t push me. After I took the
medications I felt so nauseated. [Male, focus group
4]
Some [patients] could give up the medicines, so the
doctor has to come every day. They travel by
motor cycle on difficult road conditions. [Female,
focus group 4]
While most participants agreed that the no-cost, home-based
nature of their TB treatment was a critical factor for accessibility
and adherence, they nevertheless recognized that, for themselv es
and for people they knew, there are signif icant challenges to
treatment adherence, even when the medication is provided at
home and at no out-of-pock et cost to the patient.
The main challenges participants identif ied were physical
adverse effects, which can include itching and rashes, nausea,
vomiting, lack of appetite, abdominal pain, and fatigue. Across
the groups, participants told us of many individuals they knew
in their communities who had interrupted treatment because of
intolerance to adverse effects:
[Some people] do not want to be healed. They throw
away the medicine which cause them some adver se
effects. [Male, focus group 1]

RenderXThe reason why patients refuse to take medicines is
because of adver se effects. They make them nauseated
or feel itchy.[Male, focus group 4]
[A neighbor] did not take [the medicine]. He said it’s
difficult and [has a] bad smell. [Male, focus group
5]
Many also reported that they themselv es had experienced
difficulties “because there are very terrible adverse effects”
(female, focus group 1). Adverse effects, they explained, can
be confusing and scary , as in this participant’ s experience:
For me after I took the medicines I developed numb
joints and the lower part of my body became numb .
I was panic ked... [Male, focus group 4]
Our participants noted that a key difference between
nonadherent patients and themselv es was that the participants
were able to overcome their discomfort with the adverse effects
and remain in treatment, as well as their determination to
complete their treatment:
When the doctor came here he gave me some
medications, which were difficult to swallow for the
first 2 months. I had itching, couldn’ t stand their
strong odor, and felt nauseated. I had so much
discomfort for the first 2 months. It was so horrible
that I felt I was going to die. My weight then dropped
to 56 kg, down from 60 kg. The smell was so
repugnant and even if my childr en cook ed porridg e
and fried or grilled cured dry beef for me I turned
them away . But when I finished the larger tablets
[and] I began to take the smaller ones I could eat
very well and was able to eat anything including
pickled vegetables, and my weight now is 63 kg.
[Male, focus group 4]
We want to be cured, we have to try to be patient with
eating , have to think appropriately for taking medicine
to be cured. Do not give [away], do not throw [it]
out, [we] take it all, and do not leave it.[Female,
focus group 5]
Another issue participants identif ied was the pill itself. When
asked what may lead a TB patient to interrupt treatment, a few
participants agreed that the pills are large and difficult to
swallow, which may lead some patients to interrupt treatment
very early on. As one participant noted: “Some people complain
that the medicine is too big to take” (male, focus group 6).
Another one argued that the pill size was especially hard for a
particular group: “For elders, [they] cannot swallow” (male,
focus group 5). A participant told the group about a neighbor’ s
experience:
I saw one neighbor , she is a woman. She said when
she takes medicine in the first session, the tablets are
big. She said when she took medicine , it’s difficult to
take it, and [she was] afraid of the medicine . So, she
took [it] only for a few days, [then] she gave up, stop
taking [the medicine]. [Female, focus group 3]
A few participants recognized that the length of treatment poses
challenges for adherence, even as the majority agreed that
following the health care professional’ s advice and continuingtreatment exactly as prescribed are the key to recovering from
the disease. Some admitted that this was true even for
themselv es, as in the following example:
[W]hen we take [the] medicine , it is difficult and
sometime it’s too long time to take. Even I sometime
do not want to be cured.[Female, focus group 3]
Another participant commented more generally:
[S]ome people take [the medicine] for half the period,
and they feel better , then they give up at the half
period. They think they are better , they are cured.
Actually , this disease , we need time. So, they give up
at the half period, they think they are better , they don’t
think it will be reactive .[Male, focus group 3]
Some participants also expressed the view that there are people
with TB who may be “less likely to belie ve in medicines; they
belie ve in traditional medicine” (male, focus group 1). For
example, speaking of a neighbor who had recei ved treatment
but not followed it appropriately , a participant said: “Maybe he
does not belie ve. He does not belie ve that the medicine could
treat well” (male, focus group 6).
Experience With Mobile Phone Featur es
Most participants (n=41) said they owned a mobile phone, but
a signif icant minority (n=23) reported they did not own one or
use a phone owned by a family member . This is well below
estimates in 2016 that over 96% of Cambodians aged 18 to 65
years reported owning a mobile phone [7]. A possible
explanation for this discrepanc y is the higher concentration of
older participants in our sample (n=24, 38% individuals ≥60
years old) relati ve to the national average (estimated at around
7%) [38].
The majority of our participants who owned mobile phones
used them for making and recei ving phone calls. Other basic
functions were far less common. Only 8 people reported using
their phones to send or recei ve text messages, 7 reported using
their phones to send or recei ve mone y, and only 1 used them
to send or recei ve videos. Nevertheless, while the use of mobile
phones to send and recei ve mone y was not widespread, many
people reported being familiar with Wing (the largest mobile
mone y platform in Cambodia) and other mobile mone y services
when these were brought up in the discussion.
We probed our participants about reasons for not using their
phones for mone y transfers, an element that would allow
integration of incenti ves directly into a mobile app. Those who
did not make any mobile cash transfers typically said that it was
either because they did not know how to use these apps, or
because they had no one to transfer mone y to or from (or a
combination of both these reasons). Among those who had used
their mobile phones to send and recei ve mone y, the view was
that these services were convenient and easy to use:
In terms of using phones to transfer mone y, I think if
we know [how to use it], it’s easier than going to
receive [the mone y] at the bank or organization. It’s
easier because the phone is in our hands. [Male, focus
group 6]

RenderXRecepti veness to VDO T and Cash Incenti ves
Overall, participants were recepti ve to the general concept of a
mobile app for VDO T. There was widespread recognition that
an app could be convenient, as it would save time for both
patients (in particular those who still had to attend health
facilities for their treatment) and providers:
If we spend time to meet doctor at the health center ,
it’s difficult. It takes a long time. Sometime , some
patients do not have time. So, if you introduce us to
use this, it’s easier and saves time.[Female, focus
group 3]
We can alleviate the doctor’ s workload because he
would not have to come every day.[Female, focus
group 4]
At the same time, participants expressed some concerns about
this approach. First, some participants worried about the
implications of seeing less of their health care provider , since
VDO T would replace most of the home visits of the provider .
A few individuals across the groups wondered where they would
get their medications from if the home visits were discontinued:
“If we don’t go to meet the doctor , where can we get the
medicine, if he does not bring it for us?” (female, focus group
5).
Second, a related question was whom they would ask questions
about their health if their face-to-f ace interactions with their
providers were decreased. Two participants, for example,
expressed a clear preference for seeing their health care
providers in person rather than having them follow their
treatment remotely:
Seeing the doctor in person is better , as she can
explain and advise us more.[Male, focus group 4]
Go to meet doctor is better ...because we can talk face
to face for longer discussion. [Male, focus group 5]
When presented with the concrete example of the existing
VDO T app, there was widespread concern about the technical
aspects of the app. Even though the moderator described the
app in some detail using printouts with pictures of the various
screens and functions, there remained some apprehension among
participants that they would not know how to use the app.
Nevertheless, there was also agreement that if participants were
taught how to use it on their phones they would be willing to
try it.
Third, participants who did not own phones at the time of our
focus group wondered how the app would apply to them.
In a few instances, participants worried about illiterate patients
and how they would be able to navigate an app that, as they saw
in the printouts, includes some text.
We also asked participants about their views of cash transfers
proposed as incenti ves to adherence, which could potentially
be a component of VDO T platforms. Most people welcomed
the incenti ve idea, but many did not want to comment on how
much the incenti ve should be or said they did not know what
would be suitable. Those who agreed to comment on how much
would be appropriate argued that some where between US $0.50
and US $1 per intak e would be acceptable (although a verysmall number of participants argued for higher incenti ves, of
US $2 or more).
Nevertheless, while our participants generally welcomed a cash
incenti ve, many said that getting the medicines for free was
sufficient incenti ve and mone y was unnecessary: “Having
medicines is good already , sir. There is no need to have cash
prize” (female, focus group 4).
Discussion
Principal Findings
Our findings showed that familiarity with mobile technology
and apps was widespread in this population, and overall
willingness to consider a mobile app for VDO T was high. The
themes that emer ged are in line with VDO T acceptability studies
in low-income countries including India, Vietnam, Kenya, and
Uganda [15,26-29] and broadly consistent with well-accepted
frame works for assessing the potential acceptability of
technology to individuals, such as the technology acceptance
model or the unified theory of use and acceptance of technology
[39,40].
Our results, however, also highlighted some potential challenges
that might arise with transitioning from a face-to-f ace interaction
to VDO T and the resulting implications for interv entions. First,
many patients related their overall levels of satisf action with
and adherence to frequent, reliable, and high-quality in-person
interactions and encouragement. This may then manifest in
erosion of both patient satisf action and adherence in the conte xt
of an app-only interv ention. In addition, the most frequently
cited barriers to adherence were adverse effects, which required
physician interv ention, and dissatisf action with the treatment
regimen in general, rather than forgetfulness or incon venience
(which are typical factors that work in favor of introducing
regular VDO T over periodic in-person visits). Any VDO T
interv ention may thus need to prioritize timely and frequent
feedback and encouragement, as well as ensuring regular
interactions with health professionals at interv als, in particular
during the first (intensi ve) phase of treatment, to ensure
mitig ation of any potential physical and mental harms from less
frequent in-person contact.
Second, despite good internet netw ork coverage in our selected
areas, not all patients in our study owned a phone. However,
almost all patients had access to one. In addition, for most
individuals, especially in less urban areas, the use of the phone
beyond calls was limited, and familiarity with key aspects of a
VDO T platform such as texting and videos was low, with only
1 individual using video regularly . With access to a phone being
household-based rather than individual, there may be
implications for patient privacy and adherence to a regular
schedule of use.
Third, given the rapidly expanding penetration of mobile
netw orks across Cambodia, we expected a higher degree of
ownership than we found in our focus group sample, with only
41 individuals personally owning a mobile phone. This may
limit the accessibility of an app and lead to concerns such as
confidentiality and reliability of access, which may not be
assured on a borro wed phone. On the other hand, these findings

RenderXalso suggest that providing phones to participants as part of the
interv ention may prove a strong incenti ve to participate. In the
focus groups, when the moderator explained that those without
phones could be provided with one, enthusiasm and
recepti veness to an app signif icantly increased.
Fourth, the benef its of the app are not likely to accrue to all
groups equally . The demographic profile of users may be
signif icant. Younger , more educated, and emplo yed individuals
may be most able to use the app and most likely to benef it from
a more efficient interaction, whereas older adults may not only
find the app more challenging, but also be most likely to
experience adverse effects or be averse to losing the in-person
interaction. Another issue is how to make the app suitable for
illiterate patients. Literac y rates among Cambodian adults have
been estimated at around 80%, which makes illiterac y a very
signif icant problem [41]. While the proportion of illiterate TB
patients is unclear , it is likely that it will at least mirror , if not
exceed, that of the general population. The initial response to
the presentation of a specif ic app platform was relati vely
subdued among illiterate users. The rollout of such an app may
therefore not be universal, and instead would need to take the
likely user profile into consideration, with training possibly
extended to family members living with or close to the patient,
who may act as treatment supporters especially with illiterate
or older patients. Future development could focus on designing
a language-free interf ace with visual cues in the form of symbols
or icons instead of words.
In spite of these concerns, it is clear from our focus groups that
participants were broadly recepti ve of our proposed innovation,
as long as basic safeguards are put in place (in particular phone
provision, training, uninterrupted access to the medications,
continued access to a health care provider , and suitability for
illiterate patients). Moreo ver, an app was percei ved to be
convenient not only for themselv es; surprisingly , patients felt
positi ve about lessening the burden on providers as well, which
is likely to ease a transition to a new platform.Limitations
First, one limitation of our study was the reliance on a
convenience sample. Individuals who are willing to attend focus
groups about adherence may be more likely to be generally
adherent or positi vely disposed toward treatment or Operation
ASHA in general.
Second, the use of a hypothetical, graphical presentation of a
possible mobile app limited our ability to predict real
acceptability and use. This may be especially problematic, as
our sample demonstrated remarkably low exposure to apps
overall, in spite of netw ork coverage and access to smartphones,
potentially due to a lack of familiarity or the lack of relevant
service provision via apps at the time of the study . While a more
in-depth investig ation of factors driving this lack of exposure
is beyond the scope of our study , it is worth more detailed
exploration. We should reiterate, regardless, that participants
were enthusiastic about the possibility of using an app as it was
presented to them.
Third, some of our findings are conte xt specif ic. The level of
care provided by ASHA with extensi ve outreach may not be
typical of DOT models in many parts of the world. Furthermore,
none of our participants had used mobile apps for TB treatment,
let alone health, before. These circumstances may limit broader
generalizability across other treatment settings and models of
care.
Conclusion
Our findings suggest that, while VDO T is a promising
technology as long as appropriate safeguards are put in place,
even in country settings where mobile penetration is reportedly
almost universal, it should be introduced with caution. However,
the results are generally promising and yield important insights,
which not only will be translated into the further adaptation of
key features of the VDO T app for TB patients in Cambodia,
but also can inform the future design and successful
implementation of VDO T interv entions in LMIC settings more
generally .
