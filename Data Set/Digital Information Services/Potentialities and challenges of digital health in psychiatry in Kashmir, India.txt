Since the inception, the people of Kashmir have been
exposed to enduring conflict, war, and political insta-
bility that take a huge toll on the mental health and
well-being. About 45% (1.8 million) of the Kashmiri
population is suffering from some sort of psychological
distress.1However, health-seeking behaviors have been
seriously affected by curfews, lockdowns, and commu-
nication black-outs due to recent political turbulence.2
Additionally, Kashmir is vulnerable to several types ofdisasters particularly earthquakes, landslides, floods,
and avalanches due to its geographical characteristics.
Moreover, the current COVID-19 pandemic along with
lockdown measures to prevent the spread of the disease
has worsened the mental health status of the Kashmiri
population.
Telepsychiatry has been recommended as a cost-
effective strategy to meet the high unmet need for
mental health services to the remote and areas with
conflict.
3The establishment of telepsychiatry could
have an immense impact on the mental health system
of Kashmir as there is a shortage of mental health
professionals. There are around 41 psychiatrists and
12 clinical psychologists for a Kashmiri population of
12.5 million (2011 census).4Following nationwide lock-
down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of
patients at psychiatry outpatient departments (OPDs)
has reduced in the government hospitals while OPDs atprivate hospitals were closed. The Indian Psychiatric
Society released a position statement on 30 March
2020, advocating the use of available technology to
‘reach the unreached in the form of online consultationwith the psychiatrist.
5It also asked to refill with an old
prescription or through online prescriptions till thecrisis is over. The timely release of the Telemedicine
Practice Guidelines by the Government has motivated
care providers in India to deliver much-needed medicalevaluation, diagnosis, and triage remotely during thecurrent COVID-19 crisis.
6Many clinicians and patients
in Kashmir are now realizing the full potential of tele-
health tools, as they are forced to utilize them to con-
nect in a time when in-person and face-to-face visits areimpossible. One of the major benefits of tele-mentalhealth services is the possibility of remote assessment
(triage) and the provision of care by the health service
providers especially during times of disasters. Rapid

virtualization has shown that clinicians, patients, and
systems can quickly adapt to telepsychiatry, though not
without challenges and lessons learned. The regulatory
and system changes brought by the COVID-19 crisispresent the opportunity for the field to gather lessons
learned to strategically shape the post–COVID-19 tele-
psychiatry services in Kashmir.
However, in Kashmir, the implication of telepsy-
chiatry is challenging due to the second generation
(2 G) mobile network, frequent communication black-outs, lack of infrastructure, poor digital literacy, and
absence of a functioning community mental health
team. Instituting the telepsychiatry in Kashmir willneed assistance from government authorities, interna-
tional agencies (World Health Organization, United
Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund),non-governmental organizations, and all other stake-
holders. The adequate fund is an extremely important
prerequisite for the telepsychiatric services followed bythe well-designed modification of existing services such
as clinics is warranted. Effective and culture-specific
strategies to improve digital literacy and furtherresearch are recommended. Telehealth is an underutil-
ized and underestimated mode of treatment in Kashmir
and may play a vital role in providing mental healthservices in Kashmir.
