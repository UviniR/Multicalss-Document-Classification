Abstract
Online food delivery (OFD) platforms guarantee access to food during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic when commercialfood establishments are closed and access to food retail is controlled. The present study aimed to describe the advertisements published in anOFD platform in Brazilian capitals, during the 13th and 14th weeks of the pandemic. Data collection occurred on 1 d of the week and 1 d of theweekend and during lunch and dinner time. A random sample of 25 % of the advertisements ( n1754) published in this period was classified in
accordance with the presence of food groups and to the use of marketing strategies. Sandwiches, ultra-processed beverages, traditional meals orpasta were the most common food groups shown in the advertisements. Free delivery prevailed in advertisements of ice cream, candies or saltypackages snacks and pizza ( P<0·01). Combos were more frequently shown in the advertising of natural juices or smoothies, ultra-processed
beverages, sandwiches and pizzas ( P<0·01). Messages about healthiness were more seen among natural juices or smoothies, vegetables and
traditional meals and pasta advertisements ( P<0·01) and less seen in sandwiches ( P=0·02) and pizza advertisements ( P<0·01). Economy
messages were rare in advertisements of traditional meals or pasta ( P<0·01) and more common in ultra-processed beverages ( P=0·03)
and ice cream, candies or salty packages snacks ( P<0·01) advertisements. The OFD platform promoted unhealthy eating during the
COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil due to the expressive presence of unhealthy foods advertising.
Key words: COVID-19: Digital media: Food environment: Food marketing: Brazil
In December 2019, several cases of pneumonia appeared in the
city of Wuhan, China. Analysis of the genetic material isolatedfrom the virus showed a new βcoronavirus, the severe acute res-
piratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease iscalled coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and quickly spreadacross Chinese territory and the whole world. On 30 January2020, the WHO declared the disease as a global public healthemergency and, on 11 March 2020, as a pandemic with serioushealth, economic and social impacts
(1,2).
In Brazil, the first case of the COVID-19 was confirmed on
29 February 2020. Measures of social distancing are beingapplied in the country to control the spread of the virus, whichinvolve closing food commercial establishments and controllingaccess to food retail
(3,4).
Consequently, many of the food commercial establishments
migrated to take-out and delivery services(4–6)and the use of online
food delivery platforms increased in Brazil: during the lockdown,the use of these applications (apps) grew up by 9 % on weekdaysand 10 % on weekends
(7). However, food services migration tothe digital environment and the greater use of these apps by
consumers can negatively impact on population ’s health since
studies prior to the pandemic have characterised the digital foodenvironment as obesogenic by high offer of unhealthy foods
(8,9).
Online food delivery platforms also use intensive marketing
strategies(8,10), such as photos, discounts, free delivery and com-
bos (a combination of food items and or drinks offered at a dis-
count), mostly directed at unhealthy meals(8). These strategies,
especially those that confer some financial benefit to the con-sumer, can play a prominent role during the COVID-19 pan-demic, due to the greater socio-economic vulnerability of theconsumer
(11,12). In Brazil, during the social distancing period,
the pandemic costs are estimated at R$ 20 billion per week(13).
Digital food environment covers social media and the digital
marketing(10)and changes in this environment can impact on the
population health. Thus, understanding the implications of the
COVID-19 pandemic under the digital food environment inBrazil can direct policies and actions that promote healthy eatingpractices during and after this health crisis
(14).

 Published online by Cambridge University PressThe present study aims to describe the advertisements pub-
lished in an online food delivery platform in the twenty-sevenBrazilian capitals, during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methodology
This is an analytic study that inv estigated food advertising in an
online food delivery platform in the twenty-seven Brazilian capitalsbetween the 13th and 14th weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The platform under study was created in Brazil in 2011 and is
currently the biggest food tech company in Latin America, beingpresent in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia. In Brazil, at the time ofthe present study, this platform was the only that served all the
Brazilian capitals. In 2019, the platform delivered an average of
13 million orders per month and this number reached 39 millionduring March 2020, when more than 1 ·5 million downloads of
the app were registered. Inside this platform, consumers canaccess the menus of the registered restaurants and orderready-to-eat meals. Their orders are forwarded to these food out-lets and once ready, meals are delivered to customers by couriers
working. Payment method includes meal vouchers or debit/
credit cards. Food advertising can be shown on the home pageof the app aiming to access all consumers that use the app orinside restaurant menus aiming to access the specific public thatis interested in a restaurant.
In our study, all the advertisements ( n7005) available on the
home page of the app were recorded. We did not include theadvertisements made available only inside a restaurant menu.
Data collection was carried out on two non-consecutive days,
1 d of the week and 1 d of the weekend and comprised lunch(11.00 –13.00 hours) and dinner time (18.00 –21.00 hours).
These meals were chosen because they represent, in additionwith breakfast (03.00 –10.00 hours), the main meals in terms of
daily total energy intake contribution in Brazil
(15).
A sample of 25 % of the advertisements ( n1754) was selected by
a randomisation process stratified by the day of the week, the meal-
time and the city. Therefore, the se lected sample represents the uni-
verse of food advertising inside t h ef o o dd e l i v e r ya p ph o m ep a g e
according to the Brazilian ’s capitals, day of the week and mealtime.
Foods announced in advertisements were classified into the
following food groups: water; natural juices and smoothies; veg-etables; fruits; traditional meals (dishes predominantly made
with unprocessed and minimally processed foods very typicalin Brazil) and pasta; ultra-processed beverages; ice cream and
candies and salty packaged snacks; sandwiches; savoury snacks;pizzas ( Table 1 ). These food groups were defined based on a
previous research that characterised food availability and adver-tising inside online food delivery platforms in Brazil
(8)and are
aligned to the NOVA food classification system(16,17)and the
Brazilian Dietary Guidelines(18).
The marketing strategies investigated in each advertisement
were free delivery, discounts, use of photos, combos (a combinationof food items and or drinks offered at a discount) and messages ofhealthiness, economy and tasty and pleasure.
Double coding of all advertisements was run in an Excel
spreadsheet by two independent assessments with eightresearchers completing this work. The coding was checkedfor agreement, and all divergences were solved by a researcher
not involved in data collection.
Data analysis was performed using Stata software (version 14.0).
Advertisements were rated for the presence of food groupsand marketing strategies participation and were described onthe weekdays (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday andFriday) and on the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) as well asat lunch and dinner and according to the regions of the country
(North/Northeast/Midwest and South/Southeast). The differences
were tested by applying Pearson ’sχ
2test at a 5 % significance level
(P<0·05). This test was also performed to compare the participa-
tion of marketing strategies in the presence of food groupsadvertising.
Results
Advertisements were published equally between the days of theweek (weekday: 51 ·4 %; weekend: 48 ·6 %) and were concen-
trated on dinner (58 ·3% ;4 1 ·7 % at lunch).
Sandwiches, ultra-processed beverages, traditional meals or
pasta and pizzas were the most common food groups shown
in the advertisements. The other food groups were present in
less than 5 % of the sample. Vegetables and traditional mealsor pasta were more advertised at lunch ( P<0·01). The latter
were also more exhibited on the weekday advertising(P<0·01). In contrast, ultra-processed beverages, sandwiches
and pizzas were more advertised at dinner ( P<0·01). Pizzas were
also more frequent in advertisements for the Southeast and South
regions ( P=0·04) (Table 2 ).

 Published online by Cambridge University PressAlmost all advertisements used photos or discounts
and about half of the sample used free delivery. Combos(P=0·01) and photos ( P=0·03) were more common on the
weekdays advertising, while tasty and pleasure messages pre-vailed at the weekend ( P<0·01). Free delivery ( P=0·02),
combo ( P<0·01) and messages of economy ( P<0·01) were
more common on advertisements spread at dinner, whilethe use of photos and healthiness messages were more frequentat lunch advertising ( P<0·01). In addition, free delivery ( P<0·01),
discount ( P<0·01) and economy messages ( P=0·02) were more
frequent in the Southeast/South advertising ( Table 3 ).
Finally, free delivery prevailed in advertisements of ice
cream, candies or salty packages snacks and pizza ( P<0·01)
and was less common among advertisements about sandwiches(P=0·02). Combos were more frequently shown in the advertis-
ing of natural juices or smoothies, ultra-processed beverages,sandwiches and pizzas ( P<0·01). However, combos were less
commonly used when the advertisement was about traditionalmeals or pasta ( P<0·01). Photos were more commonly used
in ice cream, candies or salty packages snacks ( P=0·03) adver-
tisements, while this strategy was less common in ultra-proc-
essed beverages advertisements ( P=0·04). Messages about
healthiness were more seen among natural juices or smoothies,vegetables and traditional meals and pasta advertisements(P<0

Discussion
The digital food environment represented by an online food
delivery platform proved to be obesogenic in Brazil due to theexpressive presence of unhealthy foods advertising during theCOVID-19 pandemic. Characteristics related to the day ofthe week, mealtime and region of the country differentiatedthe advertisements.
The study described for the first time the profile of advertise-
ments in a food delivery app in all Brazilian capitals in a momentwhen food commercial establishments were closed and the dig-ital food environment represented an important way of acquiringready-to-eat meals
(4). The study showed that unhealthy foods
prevailed in the advertisements, mainly due to the presence ofultra-processed beverages and sandwiches, while the healthyfoods, mainly represented by traditional meals and pasta, wereTable 2.

 Published online by Cambridge University Pressadvertised less frequently. Marketing strategies were more
directed to advertisements containing unhealthy foods and pre-vailed the use of photos, discounts and free delivery.
In other words, when the digital food environment becomes
one of the main means of acquiring ready-to-eat meals in theworld
(5,6,19), advertisements promoted by restaurants registered
in a food delivery app in Brazil were mostly focused on unheal-thy meals and used marketing strategies in order to persuade theconsumer to purchase these products.
Study conducted in 2019 described the use of photos and dis-
counts and the menus of the restaurant registered in two onlinefood delivery platforms in a Brazilian capital: ultra-processedbeverages were present in 78 ·5 % of the restaurant menus, while
water and natural juices and smoothies appeared in 49 and 27 %of the menus, respectively. Sandwiches, pizzas and fried snackswere options in 39, 13 ·8 and 16 ·6 % of the menus, while tradi-
tional meals were checked in 20 ·4 % of restaurant menus and
vegetables in 16 ·9 %. The use of photos and discounts were more
frequent in menus that offered meals containing unhealthy foodgroups compared with meals containing unprocessed and min-
imally processed foods
(8).
The frequent use of marketing strategies in food delivery plat-
forms aims to persuade the consumers to buy inside the apps atthe same time they are having a great experience of shopping.The literature has pointed out some potential drivers of onlinefood delivery service: convenience, usage usefulness andhedonic motivations
(20–22). The marketing strategies used by
the online food delivery platform under study aim to confer thesecharacteristics to the digital environment.
The intense desire for convenience food is a result of rising
household incomes, urbanisation and a reduction in the timeavailable for activities such as cooking. More generally, reasonsgiven for consuming meals prepared away from home includethe desire for fast and filling meals, the cost and effort of cookingat home and a lack of time. Also, the usage usefulness of the fooddelivery apps is related to the costumers ’interest on technology
that can provide saving time and effort. Thus, the website mustbe user friendly and be able to process the customer ’s request asTable 4. Participation of marketing strategies on advertisements in an online food delivery platform in accordance with the food groups

 Published online by Cambridge University Pressquickly as possible(20–22). Combos strategy, for example, can
help individuals chose a meal in an extremely fast way.Having certain discounts or promotions may also attract price-sensitive consumers, as they are likely to choose the channelwhich provides them the best value for money
(20–22).
However, the time-saving factor is not the only motivation forusing online food delivery platforms. Shopping motivations
can also come from values and pleasure that consumer seeks
from shopping
(20–22). Using photos and messages of healthiness
or tasty and pleasure can enhance the hedonic experience of theconsumer when shopping online.
In our study, the majority of the advertisements that con-
tained marketing strategies, except for healthiness messages,was mainly directed to unhealthy food groups which is espe-
cially undesirable during the COVID-19 pandemic, as several
studies have shown associations between the increased risk ofmortality from this disease in obese patients and those with dia-betes and hypertension
(23,24). Thus, in addition to the problem of
stimulating an unhealthy diet for a population that is currently55·4 % overweight and 20 ·3 % obese
(25), increasing body weight
in this epidemiological moment is linked to a worse prognosis
for the COVID-19(23,24).
The study has also pointed out differences in the profile of
advertisements and marketing strategies use according to themealtime, day of the week and region of the country. This differ-entiation is in line with the dietary pattern present in the countryand the operational logic of commercial food establishments. For
example, during lunch and during the week we noticed a greater
promotional offer of traditional meals and vegetables. In Brazil,the consumption of vegetables at lunchtime is twice the amountconsumed at dinner
(26)and, the Brazilian, in comparison with
other populations, preserves the habit of having traditionalmeals, as well as the consumption of rice and beans
(27–29).I n
addition, self-service or kilo food restaurants operate during
lunch hours, while pizzerias and hamburgers shops operatemore prevalently at night and on weekends.
A greater participation of free delivery, combos and economy
messages was also more noted for the dinner, when the pres-ence of unhealthy foods advertising is higher. In contrast, thegreatest use of photos and healthiness messages was found dur-
ing the lunch period, which is the period of greatest supply of
healthy food groups. Additionally, the tasty and pleasuremessages were more common on the weekend period.Considering the regionality, restaurants of the North, Northeastand Midwest regions used less marketing strategies than the res-taurants of the Southeast and South of Brazil. The profile of foodacquisition in the North, Northeast and Midwest is characterised
by a greater participation of unprocessed or minimally processed
foods and a lower share of ultra-processed foods
(27), which may
explain the lesser incentive to consume unhealthy food groupsin these regions.
Finally, it is worth highlighting the role that food delivery apps
can exert for guaranteeing access to food during the COVID-19
pandemic. The predominance of using the digital media for
acquiring food will remain after the pandemic as a safety mea-sure to reduce all types of transmission of viral diseases
(14).I n
spite of this, the relative newness of the online food delivery plat-forms put them as a new route to the market as they do not fit intothe categories of foodservice outlet, food retail outlet or manu-
facturer, which is a factor in its absence from public healthpolicies
(22).
In this regard, food delivery apps can be improved, for
example, by including the list of ingredients and the nutritionalinformation of the announced meals and reformulating portionsize
(22). In addition, these platforms need to be regulated by
specific legislation in line with the known impact of food mar-keting on the health profile of the population, in order to notbecome another marketing space for unhealthy foods
(14,30).
The present study contributes to this discussion by providing
a description of the food advertising in an online food deliveryplatform in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic and pointsout possibilities for regulation so that this digital food environ-ment is healthier for the population during and after this san-itary context.
Despite being unprecedented and relevant to the current
health context in Brazil, the study has limitations that need tobe highlighted. First, data collection involved all advertisementsmade by restaurants in the country ’s twenty-seven capitals
between the 13th and 14th weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Therefore, data collection occurred in an initial moment of thepandemic and by the absence of previous data describing theprofile of advertisements in food delivery apps, it is not possibleto state that the data described here represent a different scenariothan the one before the installation of the pandemic. Despite this,data collection occurred at a time when the food delivery appsuse had boosted in Brazil
(7).
Furthermore, due to the fact that the study is not longitudinal
and, therefore, did not describe all the advertisements published
throughout the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, it is not possible to
state that the scenario described represents the profile of adver-tisements throughout the installation of the pandemic in thecountry. The present group of researchers is addressing this issueby studying the profile of food advertisements published indelivery apps in a Brazilian capital during the months that fol-lowed the beginning of the pandemic.
Still, the study focused on the description of advertisements
spread in a food delivery app, which does not refer to the totalityof what is offered by the restaurants registered on this platform.
Furthermore, other food delivery companies also operate online
and characterise the digital food delivery environment in Brazil.In this way, the results of this investigation portray exclusivelythe advertising strategies that restaurants registered in a fooddelivery app used to boost sales during the pandemic of theCOVID-19 in Brazil.
