Abstract
Background: A high burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is contributing to high mortality and morbidity in India.
Recent advancements in digital health interventions, including mHealth, eHealth, and telemedicine, have facilitatedpatient-centered care for NCDs.
Objective: This systematic review aims to evaluate the current evidence on digital interventions for people living with NCDs
in India and the outcomes of those interventions.
Methods: We adopted PRISMA guidelines and systematically reviewed articles from MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, and
Scopus databases with following criteria: journal articles presenting digital intervention(s) used by people with at least oneof the NCDs, reporting health outcomes following the intervention, studies conducted in India among Indian population.
Results: Among 1669 articles retrieved from multiple sources, only 13 articles met our criteria. Most ( n¼7) studies were
conducted in southern states of India; eight studies included patients with diabetes, followed by neuropsychiatric disordersand other NCDs. Five studies recruited participants from tertiary hospitals; six interventions used text-messaging for
delivering health services, and 10 studies reported randomized controlled trials. All the studies reported positive health
outcomes following the intervention, including better self-management, increased patient–provider communication,improved medication adherence, and reduced disease symptoms. Most studies scored moderate to high in quality assess-
ment checklist of Downs and Black.
Conclusion: Current evidence suggests a low number of interventions with positive outcomes. Future research should
explore avenues of advanced technologies ensuring equitable and sustainable development of digital health interventions
for people living with NCDs in India.

Introduction
The World Health Organization (WHO) deﬁnes non-
communicable diseases (NCDs) as chronic conditions
of long duration resulting from a combination of genet-
ic, physiological, behavioral, and environmental fac-tors.
1Nearly 63% of all deaths can be attributable to
NCDs, making this the leading cause of mortality in
the world.2While more than 36 million people die each
year due to NCDs, about 80% of NCD deaths occur in
low and middle-income countries.2India is a highly
populous country with a population of more than 1.3
billion which is facing an immense burden of NCDs.3
Demographic and epidemiological transitions over the
past few decades have resulted in a shift in the national
burden of diseases from infectious diseases to NCDs.3,4
In 2017, India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative
Collaborators reported nationwide variations of dis-
ease burden, which highlights that the prevalence of
and mortality due to NCDs have increased across allthe states between 1990 to 2016.
5About 8.3% of all
deaths and 5% of total disability-adjusted life years
(DALYs) in 2016 were due to the contribution ofcancer, which has doubled since 1990.
6In addition to
contributing to mortalities and morbidities, NCDs also
affect the national economy enormously. For example,the economic losses from heart disease, stroke, and dia-
betes were estimated to be US$54 billion in 2015.
7
Considering the population health and associated chal-
lenges, it is essential to explore potential avenues to
alleviate the high burden of NCDs in India.
Providing conventional care for NCDs in a large pop-
ulation can be difﬁcult because patients living with
chronic conditions need continuous monitoring andprolonged treatment.
8As the country suffers from a
lack of adequate healthcare infrastructure and a
severe scarcity of human resources for health,9conven-
tional healthcare delivery methods involving face-to-
face doctor–patient interactions might not be available
to most of the people in India. Moreover, critical chal-lenges such as long distance from the nearest health
center, lack of transportation to health facilities, lack
of awareness about health services, and high cost ofseeking care can affect timely diagnosis and treatment
of NCDs.
10These problems necessitate interventions
for making healthcare for NCDs more available, acces-sible, and acceptable to the patients who need them
the most. Furthermore, chronic diseases make individ-
uals vulnerable to mental and physical stress.
11
Empowering patients and their caregivers can help in
addressing health problems through enhanced partici-
pation and adherence to optimal care at the community
level.12
In the era of digital technologies, many mHealth and
eHealth interventions have been developed to provide awide range of healthcare services to people living with
different health conditions.13–15Different devices and
platforms, including mobile phone, website, software,
wearable devices, and tablet computers, using online
and ofﬂine digital technology platforms, are increasing-ly being used in healthcare; these are collectively
termed as digital health.
16,17The WHO recognizes the
potential of digital health interventions to achieve uni-versal health coverage and ensure high-quality care to
individuals.
17These interventions can provide preven-
tive, diagnostic, therapeutic, and palliative care usingdigital platforms such as mobile phone, portable com-puting devices, internet-based applications, and social
media interfaces.
18Many such interventions are
designed and implemented for people living withNCDs. For example, a systematic review by Larson
et al. evaluated nine telehealth interventions for
patients receiving cancer care.
19They found telehealth
interventions to be similarly effective as usual care in
terms of improving quality of life among study partic-
ipants. This study highlighted opportunities to increaseaccess to effective telehealth services at a lower cost.Another meta-analysis of 35 randomized controlled
trials has reported beneﬁcial effects of internet-based
interventions for patients with type 2 diabetes melli-tus.
20Similar studies have been conducted among
patients with other NCDs, including cardiovascular
diseases,21stroke,22osteoarthritis,23depression,24and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).25Such
digital interventions facilitate better symptom assess-
ment, self-management, reduction of symptom distress,awareness of health conditions, patient–provider com-munication, timely care-seeking, follow-up and refer-
ral, treatment adherence, and improved quality of
living among the patients living with NCDs.
26–28
However, the application of such advanced techno-
logical innovations is relatively low among the low and
middle-income countries, who share the major propor-tion of the global burden of NCDs but have limited
resources and opportunities to leverage the beneﬁts of
digital health.
29,30In India, the use of digital technol-
ogies is gaining momentum in recent years.31However,
most of these interventions are being implemented
within hospitals, where the health workforce hasaccess to them.
31,32One systematic review by Bassi
et al. reported the application of mHealth interventions
in strengthening the overall health system in India with
a primary focus on health service delivery.33These
applications are mostly used by formal healthcare pro-
viders to diagnose diseases, report health conditions to
the healthcare institutions, and make decisions fordelivering care.
In addition to the available evidence on the systems-
level mHealth interventions, it is essential to under-stand how digitalization is promoting health among2 DIGITAL HEALTHindividuals suffering from chronic conditions. The use
of digital interventions has not been examined at the
user level, which highlights a critical knowledge gap
about patient-centered applications of digital healthtechnologies for NCD patients in India. Evidence on
how digital technologies are being used by people living
with NCDs and how such interventions may contributeto health outcomes may inform large-scale adoption of
evidence-based interventions among the NCD-affected
population. This systematic review contributes to thisknowledge gap. The objective of this article is to sys-
tematically evaluate the current evidence on digital
health interventions used by people living with NCDsin India, and assess the outcomes of those interventions
to inform the future development and implementation.
Methods
Search strategy
We conducted this systematic review following the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews andMeta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines.
34We searched
published studies in MEDLINE, SCOPUS, CINAHL,
PsycINFO, and ERIC databases using speciﬁc key-words, both as subject headings and general keywords,
with appropriate Boolean operators, as shown in
Table 1. These keywords were structured for searchingliterature on digital interventions for NCDs in the con-
text of India, published since the inception of these data-
bases. Four authors developed the working protocol forreview and search strategy. All the databases were
searched on 30 May 2019 for the last time.
Literature screening, inclusion and
exclusion criteria
Articles found through database searching and addi-
tional sources were screened using Rayaan QCRI andRefWorks tools, which are online platforms for con-
ducting systematic reviews and reference management,
respectively.35,36Three authors independently con-
ducted the screening process. This step was a blindedprocess; conﬂicts that appeared in independent evalua-tions were discussed, and a consensus was made in the
presence of two more authors.
We screened the literature and included articles in
this review if they were: (a) empirical studies published
in a peer-reviewed journal, (b) studies conducted
among Indian population living in India, (c) studiespresenting at least one health intervention, (d) the
intervention was delivered through mobile phone, com-
puter, internet, tablet, social media, and any digitalmedium, (e) interventions focused on at least one
NCD among the intervention population, (f) the inter-
vention was accessible to and utilized by the patients orcaregivers, (g) studies which reported any health orhealth-related outcomes among the participants, and
(h) studies published in the English language only.
Articles were excluded from this systematic review if
they conﬂicted with any of the above-mentioned inclu-
sion criteria.
Data extraction
We found 1611 articles through searching ﬁve data-
bases: MEDLINE ( n¼1072), Scopus ( n¼255),
CINAHL ( n¼93), PsycINFO ( n¼127), and ERIC
(n¼64). Also, we found 58 additional articles from
reference search, consultations with domain experts,
hand searching, and other sources (Figure 1).
Therefore, the total number of articles primarily con-sidered in this review was 1669. Further, 337 duplicatearticles were removed, and the titles and abstracts of
the remaining 1332 articles were evaluated based on the
described inclusion or exclusion criteria. After this step,we removed 1275 articles that did not meet our criteria.
The reasons for exclusion at this stage were not having

propriate study design ( n¼19), did not report out-
comes ( n¼17), and not focused on people living with
NCDs ( n¼8). Finally, the remaining 13 articles were
recruited for this systematic review. Furthermore, twoauthors re-evaluated the full texts of the ﬁnally
recruited articles and extracted data in a pre-designed
codebook. The codebook included following domainsfor data extraction: (a) location and time of the study,
(b) description and components of the intervention,
(c) types of NCDs among the study participants, (d)sampling and recruitment strategies, (e) intervention
strategy, (f) design of the evaluation study, and (g) out-
comes after the interventions.The coded data were reviewed by the other three
authors to identify conﬂicts and resolve these based
on consensus. Further, we included the key ﬁndings
in the respective domain extracted from individual
studies in a tabulated format. Finally, a brief narrative
description of the interventions, characteristics of the
study population, study or evaluation design, and the
outcomes following the interventions are presented in
the results.
Study quality assessment
In this systematic review, we used the Downs and Blackchecklist for assessing the methodological quality of
both non-randomized and randomized intervention
studies.
37Three authors evaluated the studies indepen-
dently. The results were further reviewed, and an agree-
ment was made in the presence of three more authors.

published studies. The ﬁrst sub-scale has 10 items forassessing the quality of reporting (e.g. “Are the mainﬁndings of the study clearly described?”). The secondsub-scale has three items for checking external validity
(e.g. “Were the subjects asked to participate represen-
tative of the entire population from which they wererecruited?”). The third and fourth sub-scales examineinternal validity by assessing biases in three items (e.g.“Were subjects randomized to intervention groups?”)and confounding in six items. The fourth sub-scaleevaluated confounding in six items (e.g. “Were thepatients in different intervention groups (trials and
cohort studies) or were the cases and controls (case-
control studies) recruited from the same population?”).The last sub-scale evaluates the power of the study on arange of 0–5 (e.g. “Did the study have sufﬁcient powerto detect a clinically important effect where the proba-bility value for a difference being due to chance is lessthan 5%?”) Most items can be scored as “0” for “no”or “unable to decide” or “1” for “yes”, except one item
in the reporting sub-scale (which can be score between
0 to 2) and the last sub-scale for power (scoring rangedbetween 0 to 5). Therefore, a study can receive a max-imum score of 32 in this 27-item checklist.
Results
Out of 1669 studies derived from multiple databasesand additional sources, 13 articles met our inclusioncriteria (Table 2). Key ﬁndings from these studies arediscussed below.
Study period and location
Among the 13 studies included in this review, ninestudies mentioned the study period during which theywere conducted. The ﬁrst study reporting digital inter-vention for NCDs was conducted by Patnaik et al. in2012.
38Most of the studies ( n¼5) were conducted
around 2015.39–43The most recent study, by
Goruntla et al., was conducted in 2017.44Studies
were conducted in different states of India; however,most studies ( n¼7) were from southern states. The
highest number of studies ( n¼3) were conducted in
Bengaluru city of Karnataka state.
38,40,45There were
two studies each from Tamil Nadu39,46and Andhra
Pradesh,44,46and one each from Kerala,47Himachal
Pradesh,41Punjab,48Puducherry,42Gujarat,39and
Delhi.43
Study design, recruitment strategy, and participants
There were only two cohort studies,43,47and one pre–
post study.45All the remaining studies ( n¼10) were
randomized control trials. In most of the studies(n¼5) the participants were recruited from tertiary
care hospitals.38,42,43,48,49The study conducted by
Kleinman et al. recruited participants from multiplediabetes clinics and secondary care hospitals.
39In the
rest of the studies, participants were recruited fromvarious sources including primary care hospital,mental health clinic, community outreach program,diabetes research center, and industrial workplace.
Among the included studies, the sample size ranged
from 29 to 1000 participants. The majority of them(n¼8) recruited patients with diabetes. Three studies
recruited patients with mental health disorders.
40,42,45
One study recruited children with cerebral palsy,50and
another recruited participants with metabolic syn-drome.
49In most of the studies ( n¼9) the majority
of the participants were males, in the middle agegroup ( n¼11), with minimal literacy level to under-
stand instructions related to the interventions(n¼10). More than half of the studies ( n¼7) included
participants with access to mobile phones.
Quality assessment of the included studies
Methodological quality was assessed for all therecruited studies (Table 3). Scores in ﬁve sub-scaleswere added to calculate the total score in the scaleof 32. The mean score of the studies was 22.76 (range19–26). The mean score for randomized controlledtrials and studies with non-randomized designs were23 and 22, respectively. The studies were further eval-uated and labeled in three groups: low quality (score 18or below, n¼0), moderate quality (score 19 to 22,
n¼5), and high quality (score 23 or above, n¼9).
Among the studies recruited in this review, four stud-ies
40,47,49,50had moderate quality and the remaining
nine studies had high quality.38,39,41–46,48
Characteristics of the interventions
Among the included studies, six studies focused on self-management of the disease.
38,39,41,43,45,50For example,
Mehrotra et al. focused on self-management of depres-sion using the principles of cognitive behavioral thera-py (CBT).
45Moreover, four studies focused on
increasing patient–provider communication.39,43,47,48
For example, Kesavadesv et al. provided three options(email, telephone calls, and a secured website) for thepatients to communicate with a team of healthcareproviders.
47Five studies focused on educating the par-
ticipants about their disease.38,43,44,46,47Kesavadev
et al. and Goruntla et al. provided face-to-face educa-tional session alongside digital interventions,
44,47
whereas Jha et al. provided educational videos for theparticipants.

40,43,47For example, Sing et al.
provided reminders before the scheduled appointment
for follow-up.40They also called the participants who
had missed their appointments, requested for follow-up, and noted the reasons for missing the same. Twostudies offered counseling services to patients.
38,44For
example, Goruntla et al. provided face-to-face counsel-
ing regarding knowledge, education, and non-pharmacological strategies related to diabetes mellitusmanagement for the participants.
44Two interventions
sent reminders to increase medication adherence
among the patients including SMS reminders prior totheir medication intake.
42,44Moreover, two interven-
tions focused on increasing physical activity among
the participants.44,49For example, Radhakrishnan
et al. encouraged participants to engage in aerobicexercise and sent reminders to exercise biweekly.
49
Although majority of the studies ( n¼10) used one
digital medium to deliver the intervention, the remain-ing studies ( n¼3) used multiple methods to deliver the
interventions to the participants. Among the interven-
tions with a single component, the majority ( n¼6) used
SMS to deliver the intervention.
38,41,42,44,46,49For
example, Kumar et al, sent biweekly SMSs toparticipants in the intervention group containing mes-
sages regarding self-management of diabetes.41Two
interventions were delivered via mobile apps to sendreminders, address patients’ problems, and increase
communication with the providers.
39,45Kaur et al. was
the only study to use telephonic consultation as the onlycomponent to increase the follow-up visits by thepatients.
48Another intervention by Sharan et al. used
a virtual reality-based training program to help children
with cerebral palsy to receive rehabilitation training athome.
50T h e r ew e r eaf e w( n¼3) studies with multiple
modes of delivery.40,43,47For example, Kesavadev
et al.47provided three options for reporting the blood
glucose level—phone, email and a secure website—andJha et al. provided the facility for telephonic follow-up,SMS reminders, and access to educational videos.
43
The characteristics of the intervention studies were
diverse irrespective of the study design. The non-randomized studies used telemedicine technologies to
promote symptom management and follow-up.
43,45,47
Similar contents and approaches to promote healthier
behavior, lifestyle modiﬁcation, management of healthconditions, medication adherence, and communication
with providers were reported among intervention
studies that used a randomized controlled trialdesign.

All the studies reported outcomes speciﬁc to the NCD
of interest in the respective studies. These outcomes
included changes in biomarkers for speciﬁc
diseases, improvements in follow-up and adherence to
medication, improved health conditions in terms of
patient-reported symptoms, satisfaction and increased
participation in the offered health services. Reductionin the HbA1c level and improvement in the lipid proﬁle
was reported by most of the studies ( n¼5).
39,43,44,47,48
For example, Kesavadev et al. reported a signiﬁcant
decrease in the HbA1c level and decrease in low-
density lipoprotein.47
Five studies reported improvement in disease symp-
toms.38,45,46,49,50For example, Sharan et al. reported
improvement in balance, manual ability, and
Pediatric Balance Score among the children in the
intervention group.50Mehrotra et al. reported a reduc-
tion in the depression symptoms among the partici-
pants who completed all essential sessions.45Three
studies reported improvement in medication adher-
ence.39,42,44For example, Menon et al. reported
improvement in medication adherence and positive
change in attitude among the participants in the inter-
vention group.42
Moreover, two studies reported improvement in the
follow-up.40,47For example, Singh et al. reported that
the rate of reaching the appointment was signiﬁcantly
higher in the intervention group and 75% patientswho missed previous appointments came back for
follow-up.
40Furthermore, three studies mentioned
that participants were highly satisﬁed with the interven-
tions.39,48,50For example, Sharan et al. reported that
level of participation, motivation, and satisfaction were
signiﬁcantly higher among children in the intervention
group.50
According to the study design, both randomized and
non-randomized studies reported effectiveness in terms
of health outcomes of interest in respective studies.
Three non-randomized studies reported improved
adherence, psychosomatic health outcomes, and
better quality of living.42,45,47Among the randomized
studies, the study participants reported varying levels
of improvements in physical abilities,50management of
impaired glycemic proﬁle and diabetes,41,44,46,48,49
adherence to therapies and more frequent follow-upvisits,

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst systematic review of
digital interventions for people living with NCDs in
India. In this review, we found studies presentingdifferent digital interventions for varying diagnoses of
NCDs, ranging from cerebral palsy among children todiabetes among adult participants. A majority of the
studies ( n¼10) were randomized in design, two were
cohort studies, and one used pre–post design. Thetarget population, NCDs of interest, design and con-
tent of the intervention, and outcomes following the
intervention were diverse across the included studies.Such heterogeneity in the interventions studies does
not allow us to draw inferences on comparative out-
comes between the studies. However, within-study var-iations in terms of outcomes of interest can provideanalytical perspectives on how those interventions con-
tributed to better health outcomes. Both among the
randomized and non-randomized studies, the interven-tions attempted to increase access to different health
services and deliver health-related information or self-
management instructions to the participants. In theseprocessed, digitalization played a pivotal role in estab-
lishing unidirectional and bi-directional communica-
tion between the providers and people living withNCDs. For example, the randomized clinical trialstudy by Kleinman et al. recruited patients with diabe-
tes and the intervention group was offered mobile app
to communicate with the providers, which allowedthem to adopt self-management and lifestyle modiﬁca-
tion.
39This study found a marked increase in medica-
tion adherence and self-testing of blood glucose,highlighting how strengthened communication and
care through the digital platform resulted in better
health outcomes. Similarly, the mobile-based digitalintervention by Goruntla et al. found higher adherenceand improved outcomes in blood glucose level, blood
pressure, and lipid proﬁle.
44This evidence highlights
that frequent reminders, instructions, and counselingmay enhance treatment consumption and health out-
comes among the study participants. While all the
interventions in this review resulted in varyingimprovements in different health outcomes, none of
them reported any adverse effect or unintended conse-
quences following the implementation of the interven-tions. Despite the low number of studies, the currentevidence shows various beneﬁts of using digital health
interventions among people living with NCDs.
Furthermore, these interventions provide several criti-cal insights on how India is leveraging the avenues of
digital health and how future directions can be adopted
to improve population health outcomes in the realmof NCDs.
First, the number of digital health interventions for
NCDs is relatively low for India, which shares a majorproportion of the global burden of NCDs. Like many
other low- and middle-income countries, digital health
interventions for NCDs have not reached their fullestpotential in India, as seen in many developed nations.
5112 DIGITAL HEALTHHowever, investing in digital health can reduce the cost
of direct care, enhance access to health services, andimprove health outcomes for resource-constrained
countries.
52Future policymaking, research, and imple-
mentation should seek opportunities to adopt moreevidence-based digital approaches to improve NCD
care in the context of India.
Second, most of intervention studies were conducted
in southern states of India, whereas we did not ﬁnd any
study from north-eastern states. These states share a
similar burden of NCD compared with the nationalscenario.
5Therefore, unequal distribution of studies
highlights potential disparities in the development
and implementation of digital health interventionsacross Indian states. This necessitates careful attentionfrom researchers and practitioners to consider the
adoption of evidence-based interventions and develop-
ment of culturally tailored digital interventions forthose states where digital health is in a developing
stage.
Third, most of the studies recruited participants
from hospitals, clinics, research centers, and communi-
ty sources located in urban areas. Such urban-centered
growth of digital interventions for NCDs may not helpto improve population health outcomes, as 68.84% ofIndia’s total population live in rural areas.
53Moreover,
the rural population in India often suffers from a lack
of health infrastructure, scarcity of expert physicians,and lack of access to health services.
10These places
may have a higher need for technological advance-
ments like digital health services to bridge the gaps ofhealthcare. In recent years, mHealth interventions have
been implemented for community health services; for
example, maternal and child health services by“Accredited Social Health Workers (ASHA)” inmany states in India.
54However, the beneﬁts of the
digital revolution in healthcare remain beyond the
reach of the rural population suffering from NCDs.This is an area where future research and interventions
should be focused, to alleviate the urban–rural health
disparities in the digital era.
Fourth, most of the interventions were designed and
implemented for diabetes, followed by neuropsychiat-
ric disorders, whereas none of the included studiesfocused on cancer, cardiovascular diseases, or COPD,
which constitute a large proportion of NCDs in
India.
6,55,56People living with these diseases would
need varying support which can be delivered success-fully through digital interventions. For example, many
studies have shown how mHealth and telemedicine
interventions can help cancer patients or survivors.
57–59
Moreover, studies have also shown that the use of dig-
ital self-management and exercise-based interventions
can improve health outcomes among patients sufferingfrom COPD. These opportunities should be explored inthe context of India to improve patient-centered care in
those unexplored areas of NCDs.
Fifth, most of the included studies discussed the
implementation of digital interventions for localizedpatient populations in the respective study locations,whereas none of the studies have shown a large-scale
adoption of the interventions at the community, state,
regional, or national level. Moreover, little is knownabout the sustainability of the interventions presented
in this review. Most studies reported health outcomes
at the follow-up evaluations; however, it cannot beconcluded that the interventions have brought sustain-
able health practices and outcomes among the partic-
ipants. Moreover, digital interventions would requireavailability and accessibility to digital devices and serv-ices such as internet and messaging.
60It cannot be
assumed that the participants will continue to use the
interventions once the study has ended. Future researchin digital health in India should overcome such chal-
lenges and expand the outreach of health services for
NCDs in a sustainable manner. A few potential strat-egies to do so may include subsidizing digital health
devices and services for large-scale and sustainable
adoption,
61incentivizing healthcare providers to
encourage digital health interventions complementingconventional care,
62and development of low-cost and
culturally appropriate digital interventions for different
NCDs, ensuring optimal compliance among theusers.
63
Sixth, NCD multimorbidity is an emerging global
health challenge in which individuals suffer fromco-existence of more than one NCD.
64Earlier studies
conducted in India have shown a high prevalence of
multimorbidity,65,66which needs extensive planning
and optimal management of the patients. Studies con-ducted in other countries have shown that digital inter-
ventions can help in managing multimorbidity among
NCD patients.
67–69However, most of the studies in this
review had participants with diabetes, among which the
burden of multiple morbidities was not evaluated
explicitly. Only one study has reported an interventionfor addressing psychological stress among diabetic
patients.
38This evidence highlights the need for exam-
ining how multimorbidity exists among people report-ing one NCD, and how multiple digital health servicescan be delivered for those patients more efﬁciently.
Such development of multifaceted digital interventions
would require interoperability among healthcare pro-viders offering specialized services in multiple domains
of NCDs.
70,71As the burden of NCDs has been
increasing in India, scholars and practitioners shouldconsider such strategies to ensure optimal, multi-
pronged, and holistic NCD care in the future.
Seventh, technological aspects of digital interven-
tions should be evaluated in the context of globalHossain et al. 13advancements. Artiﬁcial technologies such as machine
learning and deep learning are increasingly being usedfor optimizing the performance of digital health inter-
ventions and customizing health services as per the
unique requirements for individual patients.
72–74Such
personalization of health services may facilitate preci-
sion healthcare delivery for patients with NCDs. While
such innovations are contingent upon availability ofbig data including genomic, behavioral, epidemiologi-
cal, and environmental data on a given population,
these advancements in digital health should beacknowledged to unlock the potential of precisionpublic health in resource-constrained contexts.
75
Current evidence in our review has shown text-messaging and internet-based applications in most ofthe studies in India. Understanding global trends in
health information technologies may help in develop-
ing digital health interventions with advanced technol-ogies in the future.
Eighth, the safety and security of personal health
data is a major concern in the age of digitalization.In developed countries such as the United States, pro-
tected health information stored or exchanged through
electronic systems is secured under regulatory measuressuch as the “Health Insurance Portability andAccountability Act - HIPPA.”
76Despite such meas-
ures, breach of protected health information is a
public health challenge in the United States.77In
India, Clinical Establishments (Registration and
Regulation) Act – 2010 and the Clinical
Establishments (Central Government) Rules 2012have been instituted to regulate health information
services across the nation;
78however, little is known
about the scope of these measures in the era of rapidlyevolving digital health. As electronic health records andother digital health applications are still under devel-
opment, future innovations in digital health in India
should be conceptualized maintaining compliancewith legislative and regulatory measures. Although
such measures would help digitalized health systems
in general, they are likely to provide more protectionto people with NCDs with a higher risk of data
breaches, as they are more likely to use digital health
services for managing chronic conditions across theirlifespan.
Ninth, the participation of the patients and their
informal caregivers is critical for effective development
and successful implementation of digital interventionsfor NCDs.
79,80Many factors, including literacy about
digital health and activation of the users, are essential
for increasing adoption of digital health interven-tions.
61,81In most of the studies included in this
review, the participants were recruited through direct
communication, which may be expensive and time-consuming. Also, the ﬁndings of successfulinterventions should be widely communicated with
people living with NCDs for better adoption of such
interventions. The researchers and healthcare strate-
gists should consider e-recruitment strategies, with cul-
turally appropriate and context-speciﬁc behavior
change communication approaches to increase partici-
pation in and adoption of such interventions amongNCD patients.
Lastly, addressing the above-mentioned challenges
and advancing digital health for NCDs would require
collegial efforts of key stakeholders including physi-
cians, other healthcare professionals, researchers
working on NCDs, specialists working on health infor-
mation technologies, health services organizations, and
policymakers.
61,82The National Health Policy 2017
recognized the role of digital health technologies and
envisioned establishing National Digital Health
Authority to develop, deploy, and regulate digital
health across the continuum of care.83It is critical to
acknowledge the high burden of NCDs in India and
incorporate speciﬁc provisions in these policy dis-
courses to create an enabling environment within
which multiple stakeholders can collaborate and work
together to promote digital healthcare for NCDs.
Limitations
This systematic review has several limitations. First,this systematic review carries the limitations within
the included studies. We acknowledge that there are
publication biases within the studies as our team
could see only the published studies with positive ﬁnd-
ings in most cases. This limits the process of learning
about those interventions which did not work or were
not published in the journals. Second, there could be
limitations within the process of conducting the system-
atic review. We searched major databases with a plau-
sible search strategy, and searched further to obtain
more articles from additional sources. Therefore, we
could not retrieve any literature stored in databases
we did not search, which may be another limitation
of this review. Third, the number of studies and
sample sizes within those studies are relatively low,which may limit generalizing the ﬁndings for wide
range of NCDs in a large country like India.
However, we strictly followed the PRISMA guidelines
and conducted each phase of the review in the presence
of two or more reviewers to eliminate potential biases
as well as other limitations in the process of conducting
this systematic review. Future evidence synthesis
should maintain strict methodologies and address the
limitations of this review to better inform evidence on
digital interventions for people living with NCDs.14 DIGITAL HEALTHConclusion
To conclude, our systematic review shows a low yet
gradually increasing number of digital health interven-
tions for people living with NCDs in India. Most of the
intervention studies have shown a wide range of posi-
tive health outcomes following the interventions, which
highlight the potential for alleviating health problems
among individuals suffering from different NCDs.
Nevertheless, our review also presents the gaps along-
side the current evidence, which may affect the overall
development of digital health interventions for NCDs
in the context of India. These gaps and challenges are
critical for the large-scale adoption of evidence-based
interventions, as well as for developing and implement-
ing newer interventions for people living with NCDs.
Future research and practice should engage key stake-
holders and address issues highlighted in this review to
advance patient-centered NCD care in the digital age in
India.
