Abstract  
Purpose  - The current analytical survey investigates the utilization and effectiveness of 
digital libraries in 51 self -financed Engineering Colleges affiliated to the Visvesvaraya 
Technological University (VTU) in the State of Karnataka, India.  
Design/methodology/approach  - The research paper is based on survey of Final year 
(IV year) undergraduate students who use these digital information resources to a great extent for 
their project work, and faculty members have been chosen for the study. Questionnaire tool was 
used to gather data .  
Findings  - Utilization of Digital Information Resources for overall purposes is found to a 
large extent among respondents with mean value of 2.28±0.89.  The Mann Whitney test shows 
that there is a significant difference in utilization  between student and faculty memb ers as 
p=0.000<0.01, which implies that digital information resources are used to a larger extent by 
faculty members and than by students.  An impressive 88.9% of respondents are of the opinion 
that digital library services are superior to conventional lib rary services. The digital library 
utilization and its purpose are correlated using Pearson correlation and its significant value 
r=0.489, p=0.000<0.01 proves that user dependency on digital information resources is 
positively increasing in the respondents ’ activities has an impact on their academic pursuits.

 Introduction:  
Digital information resources have become a vital part of an academic library .  
Engineering Educational Institutions are facing increasing competition from a global digital 
environment and ongoing change in user needs and expectations of information servic es. Today 
the quality is measured in terms of digital collections, e -resources, networking component, ICT 
tools etc.  
The technology has changed expectations of researchers, their patience, and their 
willingness to accept services that are available on dem and. The e -resources are the answer to 
expectations of the users. The pursuit of electronic information resources by libraries was driven 
by the core values of library science. It is possible to recognize in Ranganathan's five laws of 
library science the m otivation that drove libraries to incorporate electronic resources into 
services and collections. These new library concepts have been adopted by many Engineering 
Colleges in Karnataka and are providing digital resources and service to their clients. 
Vishv eswararaya Technological University (VTU) and governing body like All India Council for 
Technical Education (AICTE), understanding the technological changes; importance of digital 
resources and services, have made mandatory subscription to e -journal databa se/s to affiliated 
institutions. In this way they have enforced Engineering College libraries to acquire and manage 
digital collection time to time and cater to the needs of tech savvy users, who are always in need 
of information on their fingertips.  
Need and Significance of the study  
Electronic/digital information resources are a significant investment in many libraries and 
it must be ensured that patrons are capable of getting a good return on t hat investment.  In the 
online world, libraries must understand that access to resources is more important than collection 
building as they continue to develop new capabilities and services on par with the changing 
demands of the users.   
A majority of the institutes have initiated towards digital libraries. Additional research is 
needed to understand the direction and pace of transition from conventional libraries to digital 
libraries with a focus for providing better digital library services in accordance with the changing 
user expectations . Academic libraries are continuously working to support learning/ teaching 
system by providing pinpointed information and services according to the needs of the users.  3 
 These days, users are craving for digital informatio n resources and services to fulfill  their 
information need, as it is easily accessible and searchable.  So it was important to conduct the 
study to know the use  of digital  information  resources by the faculty and students of Engineering 
College libraries.  
Scope and Limitations of the study   
Before making any progress in social research, it is highly essential to determine its scope and its 
limitations which will be helpful for timely completion of the investigation. If the boundary of 
research is not preor dained, it becomes difficult on the part of the investigator to work in a 
scientific mind. The scope and limitations of the present study therefore has been restricted only 
to the study of the current status of digital libraries of the  Engineering colleges  of Karnataka 
State. However the present study has kept the following limitations in its scope.  
1. This study covered  only E ngineering Colleges  which are approved by the AICTE and 
affiliated to VTU.  
2. Final year (IV year) undergraduate students are using the digital resources to the  
maximum extent  for their project work and these students have been chosen for the study 
along with the faculty members.  
3. The study mainly focused on the use of digital inf ormation resources, which mainly  
consists of electronic databases, under VTU consortium, e -learning resources and 
institutional repository collections.  
 
Limitations of the Study:  
1. The study was limited to the final year undergraduate students and faculty members of 
the self -financing Engineering Colleges.  
2. The study was limited to the 51 self -financing Engineering Colleges affiliated to VTU 
established after the year 2005 -2010 .  
 
Objectives  
1. To analyze  the utilization of  various e -databases under VTU  Consortium.  
2. To aims to identify the use of e -learning resources and Institutional repository.  4 
 3. To understand the purpose of using the digital information resources by the faculty 
members  and students  
4. To evaluate the use of digital resources by the faculty and final year undergraduate 
student of these Engineering Colleges  
 
Review of Literature  
Literature Search is essential in order to be aware of the existing research and to know what 
has already come out to the surface. An exhaustive survey of the relevant literature related to the 
topic of research is the backbone of a successful research des ign. It will be needed to summarize 
the results of previous research to form a foundation of the present one and to collect ideas about 
what methodologies, techniques and to ols were used by previous researchers in case of near 
topic that one is supposed to  choose for and to assess the success of the previous research work 
based on the methodologies, techniques and tools undertaken.  
Aravind (2017)  attempt ed in his  study the usage of electronic resources among the 
students of engineering colleges in Dindigul district. The primary data were collected from the 
student respondents from 5 selected engineering colleges  in Dindigul district  by using 
questionnaire. His study  identified that majority of the respondents report the privacy problem is 
the prime problem in using electronic resources and they need workshop and classes for the 
effective use of e -resources.  Majority of respondents are use the libraries for study propose  and 
access the electronic resources regularly and once in a day. Most of responde nt’s purpose s are  
visiting and use the electronic resource for developing knowledge  and they  prefer red to use the 
Word & PPT format and PDF format to download information from the Internet.  
Shivakumaraswmay and Khaiser (2016)  surveyed the use of e -collecti on in the Mysore 
Region Engineering College Library. The  study indicated that the  use of library e -collection 
which includes users profile; purpose of visiting;  use of e -collection; use of e - database; of all 
the type of the use of e -collection “E -these s and dissertation” has the highest  mean value with 
3.25 and SD being 1.24;  the Chi Square values reveal that ( 2 = 72.434, P>0.000) there was a 
significant difference among the respondents and the biggest choice of respondents was 
“sometimes” scoring, 2 15(28.3%); the variable e -database  “IEEE (The institute of electrical and 
electronics engineers)”  has the highest mean value with 3.88 and SD being 1.28; the results of 
Chi-Square test revealed that (2 = 366.776, P>.000) the differences among the respond ents were 5 
 highly significant and the biggest choice of respondents in the use of “IEEE” was  “strongly 
agree” scoring, 319(42.0%).  Kalbande and Chavan  (2015) found that 83% of faculty daily 
spend more than one hour on computers, 93.23% are familiar with di gital resources, 60.48% 
were using digital resources at college library, 47.61% were using it for collecting subject 
information, most of the faculty members use ASTM digital library compared to other databases, 
and also expressed “limited access to intern et” and “lack of training” were the main problems, 
majority of respondents i.e. 43.01% were partially satisfied. The suggestions were, in need of 
some improvement in the dealing with the digital resources, user orientation programs, more 
computer terminals  should be installed, directory of websites should be prepared and updated, 
speed of internet, awareness and to join the consortium for maximum usage of digital resources.  
Puttaswamy and Krishnamurthy (2014)  presented the use of e -resources by the faculty 
members and research scholars various Engineering Colleges of Visvesvaraya Technological 
University (VTU) Belgaum, Karnataka. Their study observed that majority of senior level 
teachers and research scholars  access the e -resources for the research work rather than teaching. 
The study revealed that, 94% of the users were depending on e -resources which were more 
relevant for their study rather than print resources. The trend predicts that e -resources has over 
taken the print resources and predicts that the print resources would be phased out in near future.  
According to a study by Nisa, Faizul and Ali, Naushad P M  (2012),  examined the  use of e -
journals by the users of IIT Delhi, and Delhi University.   Survey me thod was used to conduct 
the study  to access e - journal use among IIT Delhi, and Delhi University users. Questionnaire 
tool was used to gather data and were administered personally among the users. The  study  
found that most of the users are aware of e - journals and they are not only using them  for 
building and updating their knowledge but also for collecting relevant material for their study 
and research purpose as information can be acquired expeditiously through e -journals.  
 
Research Methodology  
The s urvey method was used to collect the requisite data for the analysis. The study used 
questionnaire as main instrument to gather primary data from respondents. SPSS  was used for 
descriptive and inferential statistical a nalysis and hypothesis testing.   G raphs, charts  and f igures  
were generated on the basis of percentage analysis.  The techniques  and tests  used for data 6 
 analysis include percentage analysis , Chi-square (χ2) test, Fishers exact, Mann Whitney test; 
Mean, Standard Deviation and Correlation were used in the study for the analysis.  
 
Analysis and Interpretation of the Data  
Status -wise Respondents  
The status of the respondents is taken as one of the variables for  studying the use of 
digital information resources by the students and faculty members of Engineering Colleges under 
study .  The status -wise breakup of responses is indicated in table  1

Table 2 indicates the gender -wise segregation i.e. 452(51.3%) are male respondents and 
308 (48.7%) are female respondents. Further among status -wise respondents out of 370 faculty 
members, 244(65.9%) are male and 126(34.1%) are female respondents. Whereas out of 390 
students, 208(53.3%) are male and 182 (46.7%) are female respondents.

 The m ajority of them were male respondents  in both the categories (students and faculty 
members) as shown in the table 2. In addit ion to the above analysis, statistical testing has been 
conducted using the chi -square technique. The calculated chi -square values was employed to 
know the gender -wise response at 0.01 level of significance, chi -square value is 12.531 and p. 
value 0.000. T his implies that there is a difference between students and faculty with respect to 
male female ratio as highly significant as p=0.000<0.01  
 
Purpose of Visit to the L ibrary  
Engineering college  libraries are information cent ers that provide maximum information 
related to the users . These cente rs maintain an extensive collection of in formation resources in 
the form  of books, journals, etc.,  in print form or in digital form in relevant subject areas. The 
respondents  generally vis it the library for various purposes .   
 
The various purpose of  visit to the library  by the respondents is presented in the table 3

Note: The percentage is given in the parentheses  
 
The table 3 depicts that respondents  visit the library for the purposes  as mentioned .  It 
was found that m ajority  i.e. 641 (84.3%) visit the library to read Books/Journals and only 175 
(23%) visit the library for requesting books and other materials under interlibrary loan services 
provided by the library. Further, 636 (83.6%) of them visit for Issue and Return of Li brary 
resources followed by, 594 (78.1%) visit to use Digital Resources, 465 (61.2%) visit to read 
newspapers, 256 (33.7%) for photocopying information resources, 255 (33.6%) to make use of 8 
 the computer and 236 (31.1%) visit for using internet facility in the library. The remaining 203 
(26.7%) respondents visit the library to read their own information resources.  
  
According to the status -wise responses, it was found that out of the total 390 students 360 
(92.3%) students visit the library for Issue/Return  Library information resources.    Further, 320 
(82.1%) students visit the library to read Books and Journals, followed by 292 (74.8%) to use the 
Digital information Resources in the Library and 224 (57.4%) students visit the library to read 
newspapers. Th e other purposes of the users visit to the library is 148 (37.9%) students come to 
use the Computer, 128 (32.8%) for photocopy materials of the Library information resources, 
125 (32.1%) students visit the library to use the Internet facility and 101 (25.9 %) of the 
respondents to read their own information resources and only 55 (14.1%) visit the library for 
requesting the materials on inter library loan service.  
 
Among the total 370 faculty members, majority 321 (86.8%) visit the library to read 
books/journ als.  Further, 302 (81.6%) visit to use digital information resources, followed by 276 
(74.6%) faculty members visit the library for issue/return the library information resources, 241 
(65.1%) to read newspapers and 128 (34.6%) for photocopying materials o f the library 
information resources, 120 (32.4%) faculty members visit the library for requesting the 
information resources under interlibrary loan services, 111 (30%) to use the Internet facility 
provided in the library and 107 (28.9%) faculty members vis it the library to make use of the 
computers.  
 
It could be seen from the above analysis that the faculty and student respondents 
generally visit the library for various purposes. Maximum number of respondents visits the 
library to issue/return the library information resources, to use digital information resources and 
to read books/journals for their academic pursuits.

It was found that out of 760 respondents, 440(57.9%) respondents highly utilized the 
library facilities whereas 281(37%) respondents made low utilization of library facilities.  
 
Among the students, 228 (58.5%) respondents utilized the library facilities t o a higher 
extent, whereas, 143 (36.7%) students utilized the library facilities to a lesser extent and only 19 
(4.9%) students used the library facility moderately. Again, among the faculty members, 212 
(57.3%) respondents utilized the library facility to  a higher extent, whereas 281 (37%) faculty 
members utilized library facilities to a lesser extent and only 39 (501%) respondents utilized the 
library facility to a moderate extent.  
 
The Chi -square test was employed to know the utilization of library facilities at 0.05 level 
of significance, calculated chi -square value is 0.170, degree of freedom value 2 and p. value 
0.918.  This implies that there was a difference between students and  faculties with respect to 
utilization of library facilities and it is not significant as p=0.918>0.05. In other words, it implies 
that dependency and importance of library facilities was high among the respondents and they 
used the library facilities for their academic and other purposes.

 VTU Consortium  
The VTU Consortium is an e -consortium of e -resources and databases established by 
VTU for the benefit of Engineering Colleges in Karnataka. It subscribes e -resources centrally 
and allows consortium memb ers to use it at nominal charges.  
 
Awareness of E -resource Databases under VTU Consortium  
There are different E -resource databases available under VTU Consortium. Awareness of 
e-databases under the VTU Consortium was a very important aspect in the Engine ering College 
Libraries. For the effective use of databases, the user should be aware of the e -databases. The 
respondents were asked whether they were aware of this consortium and if they are aware, are 
they using it. The results were presented in table 5.

Note: The percentage is given in the parentheses  
 
To gauge this awareness, the above table 5 shows that the huge majority, i.e. 739 (99.3%) 
of the respondents were aware of different databases under the VTU Consortium and the 
remaining, only 5 (0.7%) of the respondents remarked that they were unaware of the different 
databases under VTU Consortium. Further the data has been analyzed status -wise.  
 
The status -wise responses indicated the awareness of e -database s under VTU Consortium 
that among students, large majority, i.e. 375 (98.7%) students were aware and only, i.e. 5 (1.3%) 
remarked that they were unaware of the different databases under the VTU consortium. Again, it 
was seen that all faculty members were a ware of e -databases under VTU consortium.  
 
In addition to the above analysis, statistical test has been conducted using Fisher’s Exact 
Test. The Fisher’s Exact Test reveals that  there was a difference between student and faculty 11 
 with respect to awareness  of different databases under VTU Consortium e -databases  and it is not 
significant  as p=0.062>0.05.  
 
This implies that the awareness of e -resources databases under VTU Consortium was 
cent percent by all the faculty members and only few students were unaw are of the consortium. 
A further insight into the findings clearly indicate d that most of them were aware of the different 
e-databases and a negligible number of respondents were unaware of  the VTU Consortium. The 
total awareness of the VTU consortium data bases shows the popularization of the same in the 
Engineering Colleges in the state of Karnataka.

The table 6 highlights  the frequen tly used digital databases  among the respondents. A 
maximum  number , i.e. 435 (72.4%) respondents use IEEE/IEL online database and only 14 12 
 (1.9%) use other databases. Further, 509 (68.9%) respondents use Springer database, followed by 
426 (57.6%) who use Elsevier databases, 233 (31.5%)  respondents use Proquest database,   200 
(27.1%)  respondents use ASCE database, 106 (14.3%) respondents use McGraw Hill databases, 
89 (12%) use J -Gate database and 75(10.1%) use K -Nimbus dig ital library. A fewer number, i.e.  
61 (8.3%) use Emerald, followed by 59 (8%) who use EBSCO, 31 (4.2%) use Taylor and Francis 
and 21 (2.8%) each of the respondents use Wiley Blackwell and Gale Cengage Learning.  
 
The status -wise responses further indicated  that among the students, the majority, i.e. 276 
(73.6% ) students use IEEE/IEL online database, while only 5 (1.3%) each of the respondents use 
Wiley Blackwell and Gale Cengage Learning database. Another 248 (66.1%) students use 
Springer databases, followe d by 210 (56%) students using Elsevier, 113 (30.1%) students use 
Proquest and 105(28%) they use ASCE.  Again 52 (13.9%) students use McGraw Hill database, 
42 (11.2%) students use J -Gate database and 39 (10.4%) use K -Nimbus digital library.    A fewer 
numbe r, i.e. 25 (6.7%) students use EBSCO, followed by 18 (4.8%) who use Emerald database, 
10 (2.7%) use other database, and only 7 (1.9%) of the respondents use Taylor and Francis.  
 
While among faculty members, majority, i.e. 259 (71.2%) use Springer database  and only 
4 (1.1%) members use other databases. While, 261 (71.7%) faculty members use the IEEE 
database, 216 (59.3%) use the Elsevier database, 120 (33%) faculty members use Proquest 
database and 95 (26.1%) faculty members use ASCE database. A lesser numb er, i.e. 54 (14.8%) 
faculty members use McGraw Hill database, 47 (129%) use J -Gate, 43 (11.8%) use Emerald 
database, 36 (9.9%) use K -Nimbus digital library, 24 (6.6%) use Taylor and Francis and only 16 
(4.4%) respondents use Wiley Blackwell and Gale Cengag e Learning databases.   
 
It was evident from the above analysis that the frequently used and most popular e -
databases were Spring er, IEEE and Elsevier databases. This implies that the other databases such 
as Proquest, ASCE, McGraw Hill, J -gate, Emerald, Ta ylor & Francis and Wiley were less 
utilized among the respondents compared to the above three databases.

522 (70.6%) of the respondents indicated that they have access to the computer and use it 
for retrieval of digital information resources from the college library and 194 (26.3%) access it 
from their departments. About 190 (25.7%) access the digital information resources from the 
computer centre. Also 139 (18.8%) prefer to access the digital information resources using their 
Mobile phone. Whereas, 113(15.3%) access the digital information resourc es from their home. 
Hence it can be seen that the respondents access the digital information resources from different 
locations.  
  
Regarding the faculty accessing digital information resources, a large majority 258 
(70.9%) access the digital information re sources from the college library and 140 (38.5%) access 
the digital information resources form their departments. About 80 (22%) of the faculty members 
access the digital information resources from the computer Lab/centre. While 68(18.7%) use 
their mobile phone to access the digital information resources.  Only about 50 (13.7%) access the 
digital information resources at their home.  
A large percentage of students i.e. 264 (70%) access the digital information resources 
from the College library.  Also 110 (2 9.3%) of the students access from the computer lab, 71 
(18.9%) through their mobile phones and 63 (16.8%) access the digital information resources at 
their home.  
 14 
 The above analysis shows that the respondents use the digital information resources at vario us 
places on the college campus. Their location of access of digital information resources is found 
to be mainly college library, departments and computer centre.  This shows that majority of the 
respondents access the digital information resources at the college premises only.  
 
E-Learning Resources  
Aware ness of E-learning Resource/ Lecture Notes 
 
E-learning Resources  like lecture note s are becoming  one of the major parts of the digital 
information r esource and are  gaining importance in E ngineering education. Efforts from IIT s, 
IETE , IISc and the Government of India are continuously made since 2000 to provide and 
popularize Lecture N otes in the E ngineering field. The awareness of E -learning resource is very 
importan t task for the effective utilization. Hence, the details of awareness among the 
respondents are presented in the table 8.

Table 8 shows the awareness of  e-learning resources/ lecture note s among the 
respondents. A large majority i.e. 684 (90%) respondents were aware of e -learning resources and 
only 76 (10%) respondents were unaware of e -learning resources/lecture notes.  
 
Status -wise responses regarding the awareness of e -learning resources a re as presented in 
the table. Among the students, a majority i.e. 343 (87.9%) respondents were aware and the 
remaining 47 (12.1%) students were unaware of e -learning resources/ lecture notes. Again, 
among the faculty members awareness of e -learning resourc es shows that majority i.e. 341 15 
 (92.2%) faculty members were aware and the remaining 29 (7.8%) faculty members were 
unaware of e -learning resources/ lecture notes.  
 
The Chi -square test was employed to find the awareness of e -learning resources/lecture 
notes among variables at 0.05 level of significance, chi -square value is 3.791 and p. value is 
0.052 ( >0.05).  The test revealed that the difference between faculty and students with respect to 
awareness of e -learning resources/lecture notes was not signific ant as p=0.052>0.05. It implies 
that e -learning resources played a significant role in Engineering education.  
 
Preferred E -learning Resource/L ecture Notes 
In Engineering academia, the respondents prefer to use a variety of e -learning 
resources/lecture not es. To ascertain preferences in the use of various e -learning resources, the 
respondents were asked to indicate their preferences in the use of different e -learning resources. 
The collective responses are analyzed and presented in figure 1.  
 
Figure 1 
It is seen from the figure  1 that 488 (71.3%) of the respondents preferred VTU leaning 
resource and half of the total respondents i.e.  342(50%) respondents preferred NPTEL lecture 
notes.  Only 84 (12.3%) respondents preferred MIT open Courseware. Whereas 64 (9.4%) 
respondents preferr ed Stanford University lecture notes.   
 
Status -wise analysis indicated that 248 (72.3%)  students first preference was VTU e -
learning resources and next preferred e -learning resources was NPTEL lecture notes which was 
preferred by  135 (39.4%) students. T he other e -learning resources are found to be  Stanford 39.4

 University lecture notes preferred  by 37 (10.8%) students, followed by 28 (8.2%) students 
preferring to use MIT Open Courseware, again 17 (5%) students preferred IETE EDUSAT and a 
small number i.e. 1 2(3.5%) respondents preferred Virtual lab.     
 
Again, the preference of use of e -learning resources among the faculty members 
indicated that VTU e -learning centre was the first preferred e -learning resources by 240 (70.4%) 
faculty members whereas 207 (60.7%) faculty members preferred to use NPTEL lectu re notes. 
MIT Open Courseware was preferred by  56 (16.4%) respondents and  Stanford University 
lecture notes, Virtual lab e -learning resources and  IETE EDUSAT were preferred by only  27 
(7.9%), 26 (7.6%) and  25 (7.3%) faculty members respectively.   
 
There is no doubt that the internet has assumed the role of providing a e -learning 
resources and today’s users can no longer depend only on conventional method of 
teaching/learning  to cope with the latest e -learning/e -lectures developments in their respecti ve 
field.  For more effective use of available e -learning resources in the library, the users training 
and orientation on e -learning resources should be provided to the faculty and the students.  
 
From the above analysis it can be seen that the most prefer red e -learning resources were 
VTU e -learning resources and NPTEL lecture notes.  
 
Institutional Repository  
Awareness of Institutional Repository collection in the Digital Library  
Archiving digital information resources is an important activity of  a library  for current 
and future use of information resources. Awareness of institutional repositories among the users 
is essential in use of Institutional Repository collections. The awareness of Institutional 
Repository among the respond ents is displayed in the t able 9 .

The t able 9 indicated that among 760 total respondents a majority 593 (78%) respondents 
were aware of the institutional repository in their institution and the remaining, 167 (22%) 
respondents were not aware of institutional repository collection.  
 
The status -wise results showed that 281 (75.9%) faculty members were aware of the 
institutional repository collection in their institutions and 89 (24.1%) were unaware of the same. 
Again 312 ( 80%) students were aware of  institutional repository collection and 78 (20%) were 
not aware of it.  
 
In addition to the above analysis, statistical testing has been conducted using the chi -
square technique to know the awareness of e -learning resources, the calculated chi -square value 
is 3.791 and p. value is 0.177 (>0.05) table (5.2.16).  The test revealed that  there was difference 
between faculty members and students with respect to the awareness of the institutional 
repository collections provided in their college library but it is not significant as p=0.177>0.05.  
 
Use of different Institutional Repository Collections in the Digital Library  
           In continuation of the question on the awareness  of the Institutional Repository 
collections, the respondents were asked to indicate the frequent ly used institutional repos itory 
collections . A variety of collections are available in the I nstitutional Repository  ranging from 
previous year question papers to college reports. The use of different types of Institutional 
Repository  collections is presented in the figure 2 .  
 18 
  
Figure 2  
As expected the ‘previous year question papers’, which is the most popular and 
frequently used item in the Institutional repository is used by majority 509(85.8%) of the 
respondents.  
 
Another most widely used IR collection is the ‘Syllabus copies’  which is used by 
342(57.7%) of the respondents.  The reason may be that a syllabus copy provides a total   
curriculum details.  
 
Frequently used IR collection is ‘e -books/e -journals by 307 (51.8%) of respondents. 
Similarly, 205 (34.6%) and 199 (33.6%) of the respondents have cited ‘lecture notes’ and 
‘Thesis/dissertation/project reports (ETDs)’   respectively. ‘Link to useful sites’ used by 178 
(30%) of the respondents. ‘Articles/publications’ and ‘College reports’ were not frequently used 
by majority of t he respondents as shown in the table and figure i.e. 27.2% and 23.9% 
respectively.  
   
According to the status -wise respondents use of different IR collections is indicated in the 
table 5.2.17. It is observed from the table that the most frequently used IR  collection is ‘previous

followed by the ‘syllabus copies’ as the second most frequently used collection by  176(45.6%) 
students and 164(44.3%) faculty members, ‘E -books/e-journals’ were used by 142(36.4%) 
students and  165 (44.6%) faculty members.   
 
Another frequently used IR resource is ‘lecture notes’ which is used by 107(27.4%) 
students and 98 (26.5%) faculty members. Whereas ‘Thesis/dissertation/project reports (E TDs)’ 
is used by 99(25.4%) students and 100 (27%) faculty members.  
 
The other institutional repository collections are not frequently used by the respondents 
and these collections are College reports, Articles/publications, Links to useful sites.   
 
It is evident from the above analysis that, the most popular and highly used institutional 
repository collections were ‘previous years question papers’, followed by ‘syllabus copies’ and 
‘e-books/e -journals’  
 
Purpose of Using Digital Information Resources  
The respondents were asked to provide their reasons why they utilize digital information 
resources, based on fixed options by the investigator. The various purposes, for which the digital 
information resources used, were elicited from the respond ents.  
 
Respondents were asked to identify the various purposes of using the digital information 
resources on a ‘five point scale’ and to mark the purposes in the order of preference of use 
(4=very large extent).

 The table 10 shows the various purposes of use of digital information resources. The 
highest score of ‘For updating knowledge’ given by the respondents is 2.64±1.087. The mean 
value of the student represents was 2.59±1.07 and faculty members 2.70±1.09. The Z value is 
1.33 and significant value is 0.184 since it is p>0.05. The mean difference is not significant at 
5% level of significance, which implies that the purpose of using digital information resources in 
terms of ‘Updating knowledge’ showed  no significant differ ence between students and faculty 
members as p=0.184>0.05.  
 
With regard to the use of digital information resources for the purpose of ‘Preparation for 
seminar/workshop’ with the mean value was 2.53±1.15. For the students the mean score was 
2.40±1.15 and f or faculty members the score was 2.66±1.12. The Z value being 3.30 and p. value 
0.001 since p<0.01, the mean difference is highly significant, which implies that there exists 
highly significant difference between students and faculty members with regard to  the purpose of 
using digital information resources in ‘Preparation for seminar/workshop’.  
 
Digital information resources are highly utilized in ‘Preparation for examination’ among 
the respondents with mean value of 2.46±1.18. The mean value given by stat us-wise respondents 
who are students is 2.54±1.24 and faculty members mean value is 2.37±1.10. The Z value is 2.66 
and p. value is 0.008 since it is p<0.01 the mean difference is highly significant, which implies 
that the purpose of using digital informati on resources in terms of ‘Preparation for examination’ 
was found to be different between students and faculty members.  It is encouraging to note that 
the student respondents are making maximum use of the digital information resources for their 
examination  purpose.  
 
The next purpose of using digital information resource ‘Preparing for 
research/project/articles’ had the mean value 2.44±1.12 for all the respondents, whereas the 
students mean value was 2.24±1.11 and for the faculty members scoring was 2.64±1. 06. The Z 
value being 4.68, it implied that there was high significant difference between the students and 
faculty use of digital information resources for the purpose of ‘Preparing for 
research/project/articles’.  
 
   The mean score of ‘Teaching purpose’ b y the respondents is 2.01±1.41. The mean value 
of students is 1.28±1.20 and faculty members 2.78±1.18. The Z value is 14.60 and significant p. 22 
 value is 0.000.  The mean difference is highly significant, which implies that teachers use digital 
resources to a larger extent for the purpose of teaching than the students, which is obvious.  
 
The mean score of the respondents ‘For preparation of Ph. D thesis’ is 1.63±1.36. The 
mean score of students is 1.17±1.25 and faculty members is 2.11±1.31. The Z value is 9. 65 and 
significant value is 0.000 since it is p<0.01 the mean difference is highly significant, which 
shows there was highly significant difference between students and faculty members with regard 
to the purpose of use of digital information resources ‘for  preparation of Ph. D thesis’. This 
implies that the use of digital information resources of preparation for Ph.D thesis was used to a 
large extent by faculty members and less by students. It is noticed that the dependency of digital 
information resources among faculty members shows their interest in pursuing higher studies.  
 
It is clear from the above analysis that the major purposes for using digital information 
resources were ‘For updating knowledge’, ‘preparation for seminar/workshop’, ‘for 
research/pr oject/writing articles’ by the category of respondents.  
 
The Mann Whitney test indicated that except for the purpose of using digital information 
resources ‘for updating knowledge’ for all the other purposes there was highly significant 
difference between the student and faculty members use of digital information resources.

The table 11 shows the purpose of utilization of digital library. The correlation coefficient 
value (R) is 0.489 which exhibits moderate correlation between the independent variable 
(utilization of digital library) and dependent variable (purpose), with its associated  significance 
level being p=0.000 (0.000<0.05). This shows there is a positive correlation between purpose 
and utilization of digital libraries, which implies that the utilization of digital information 23 
 resources and their purpose of use of digital informa tion resources were accepted among the 
respondents. This shows the users dependency in digital information resources and also the users 
were positively accepting the digital information resources for their day -to-day activities as well 
as their academic pu rsuits.   
 
The Overall P reference of Digital Library Services  
User preference sh ows a greater liking towards d igital libraries.  Digital libraries can be 
consider ed as one of the imp ortant online inf ormation system, making it one of the main s ources 
of reliable inf ormation for users.  On the other hand, digital libraries can als o act as ‘an 
information res ource banks with well organized and substantive data that can cater to the needs 
of large gr oup of pe ople in different l ocations via, the utilization o f enhanced technologies’. 
Digital c ollections act as the abridgment of varied inf ormation sources outside the library but can 
be use d by patr ons via the WWW. D igital Library  providing an organized c ontent space and a 
series of services that can impr ove the  co-relationship between inf ormation pr oviders and users, 
thus maximi zing the wh ole kn owledge life cycle.  
 
The study of the user preference t owards digital inf ormation res ources has a similar 
paradigm with the study of user acceptance t owards utilizing digital library . The observation of 
the overall preferences of the digital library is presented in table 12.

Table 12 shows the overall preferences of digital libraries over conventional libraries 
high among the respondents with mean value 2.85±.84.  Whereas student means value was 
(2.74±.92) and faculty members mean value was (2.96±.75). The Z value is 2.88 and p. value  is 
0.004 (0<0.01), hence difference is highly significant. The Mann Whitney Test revealed that 
there was highly significant deference between students and faculty members as p=0.004<0.01 24 
 with respect to overall preference of digital libraries over convent ional libraries. It can be 
inferred that faculty members preferred more of digital library services in comparison to 
students.

(iv) Utilization of Library Facili ties 
a. Utilisation of library facilities is found to be quite high among 57.9% (440) out of the 
760 respondents. However, 281 (37%) of the subjects surveyed made very little use of 
the library facilities. High users include 228 (58.5%) students and 212 (57.3 %) faculty 
members.  25 
 b. The chi -square test reveals that there is no significant difference between students and 
faculty members in terms of utilisation of library facilities p=0.918>0.05  
 
(i) Awareness about the E -resource Databases under the VTU Consortium  
a. 739 (99.3%) of the respondents – including 375 (98.7%) out of 390 student respondents 
and all faculty members are aware of the different e -databases available under the VTU 
Consortium.  
b. The Fisher’s Exact Test of the readings reveals that there is no significa nt difference 
between student and faculty respondents in connection with awareness of different 
databases under the VTU Consortium p=0.062>0.05. The widespread awareness about 
the VTU consortium databases among faculty as well as students shows the popular ity of 
the same in the Engineering Col leges in the state of Karnataka.  
 
(ii) Frequency of Use of Different Electronic Databases  
a. From the response, it is clear that the IEEE/IEL online database is the most popular and 
frequently used digital database among the most number of respondents with maximum 
number, i.e. 535 (72.4%) users. A majority of the student respondents 276 (73.6%) 
students and 259 (71.2%) of faculty members in the survey use this database frequently.   
b. The Springer database is another favourite used by 509 (68.9%) respondents i.e. 248 
(66.1%) students and 261 (71.7%) faculty members.  
c. 210 (56%) students and 216 (59.3%) faculty members, totalling to 426 (57.6%) 
respondents, use the Elsevier e -database frequently.     
d. These findings reveal that the most frequently used and popular e -databases among 
respondents are Springer, IEEE and Elsev ier databases (Table 5.2.11 and Figure 5.2.7).  
1. E-learning Resources  
(i) Awareness of E -learning Resources/ Lecture Notes  
a. 90% (684) of the respondents are found to be aware of e -learning resources; including 
343 (87.9%) students and 341 (92.2%) faculty members under the survey.   
b. The test reveals that both students and faculty are equally aware of e -learning 
resources/lecture notes as p=0.052>0.05. This finding implies that e -learning resources 
are playing a significant role in engineering education. (Table 5.2. 14). 
 
(ii) Preferred E -learning Resources/Lecture Notes  26 
 a. Analysis of the survey shows a great preference for VTU learning resource with 488 
(71.3%) respondents; and half of the total respondents 342 (50%) showing an inclination 
for NPTEL lecture notes.  
b. The cate gory-wise preference shows that the first choice of 240 (70.4%) faculty members 
and 248 (72.3%) students  is the VTU e -learning resource; followed by  NPTEL lecture 
notes preferred by 135 (39.4%) students and 207 (60.7%) faculty members.  (Table 
5.2.15 and F igure 5.2.9).  
2. Institutional Repository  
(i) Awareness about the Institutional Repository Collections in the Digital Library  
a. Of the total of 760 respondents, a majority 593 (78%) are seen to be aware of the 
Institutional Repository collections provided in their respective colleges.  
b. This awareness of the Institutional Repository  collections  is evident in 312 (80%) 
students and 28 1(75.9%) faculty members.   
c. At p=0.177>0.05, the test reveals that there is no significant difference in the level of 
awareness between students and faculty members. (Table 5.2.16).  
 
(ii) The Use of different Institutional Repositories in the Digital Library  
a. It is clear from Table 5.2.17 and Figure 5.2.10 that ‘Previous year question papers’ are 
the most frequently used IR collection followed by Syllabus and e -books/e -journals. The 
frequency of use of Lecture notes, articles/publications, Theses/Dissertation/Pr oject 
Reports (ETDs) are found to be comparatively less. Links to useful sites and college 
reports constitute the least frequently used Institutional Repository.    
b. Therefore, it can be concluded that the most preferred IR collection are ‘previous years’ 
question papers” followed by Syllabus, E -books/e -journals and 
Theses/Dissertation/Project Reports (ETDs).  
 
3. The Purpose of Using Digital Information Resources  
a. It is found that the use of digital information resources ‘For updating knowledge’ is a 
major purpose among respondents with highest mean value of 2.64±1.08, followed by 
‘Preparation for seminar/workshop’ with mean value of 2.53±1.15 and ‘In preparation fo r 
examination’ with mean value of 2.46±1.18. Close behind are the purposes ‘Preparing for 
research/project/articles’ and ‘For teaching’ with mean values of   (2.44±1.12) and 
(2.01±1.41) respectively.  27 
 b. The purpose ‘For preparation of Ph. D thesis’ is found least utilised with lowest mean 
value of 1.63±1.36.  
c. ‘Updating knowledge’ is found to be the most important purpose among both categories 
of respondents. The students mean value is 2.59±1.07 and facult y mean value is 
2.70±1.09. The Z value is 1.33 and p. value is 0.18. Hence there is no significant 
difference between student and faculty in the purpose of utility of digital information 
resources ‘For updating knowledge’ (p=0.184>0.05).   
d. From the Mann Wh itney test it can be observed that there is highly significant difference 
between student and faculty members in the utilisation of digital information resources 
for various purposes. These include ‘Preparation for examination,’, ‘Teaching’, 
‘Preparation f or Ph.D thesis’, ‘Preparation for Research/Project/Articles’ and 
‘Preparation for Seminar/Workshop’.  
 
(i) The Overall Purpose of Digital Information Resources  
a. Utilisation of digital information resources for overall purpose is found to a large extent 
among re spondents with mean value of 2.28±0.89. The mean values for students 
(2.03±0.87) and faculty members (2.54±0.84) show that the overall utilization of digital 
information resources is to a large extent.   
b. The Mann Whitney test shows that there is a highly s ignificant difference between 
students and faculty with respect to their overall purpose of use of digital information 
resources at p=0.000<0.01. This  implies that the overall purpose of use of digital 
information resources is shown to a large extent by fa culty members and less by students.  
(ii) Correlation between the Purpose and Utilization of Digital Library  
a. It is noted that there is a positive correlation between purpose and utilization of digital 
libraries. The correlation coefficient value (R) 0.489 exhibi ts positive correlation between 
the independent variable (Utilization of digital library) and dependent variable (Purpose), 
with its associated significance level being p=0.000 (0.000<0.05).  
b. This analysis implies that the utilization of digital resource s and the purpose of use of 
digital resources are accepted among the respondents .  
The Overall Preference of Digital Library Services  
The advantages of digital libraries over conventional libraries are concluded as overall 
preferences for digital libraries .  28 
 a. It is seen that the respondents’ overall preference for digital libraries over conventional 
libraries is because of the many benefits with mean value of 2.85± 0.84.  Mean value of 
students’ preference is 2.74± 0.92; and that of faculty members is 2.96± 0.75.  
b. The Mann Whitney Test reveals that there is highly significant difference in the 
perception of students and faculty members (p=0.004<0.01) with respect to overall 
preference for digital libraries. It can be inferred that faculty memb ers had slightly more 
benefits in comparison to students.  
 
Suggestions for Effective Utilization of Digital Information Resources  
  The study reveals that the use of digital information resources is not a problem among 
majority of the respondents; but a fe w users do face some difficulty. To enable such users to 
overcome the problems, the following suggestions are made for the effective use of the digital 
library. This will help every user of the institute to feel comfortable and interested in using 
digital information resources and services:  
a. Effective user orientation and information marketing programs may be conducted by each 
library to promote the use of digital information resources. It should be arranged according to 
the status of the users. A training p rogram schedule should be publicized  so that maximum 
users can benefit from it.  
b. All the users should be fully notified of the various digital information resources and services 
available in the college library.  
c. Regular policies should be framed at college level to collect and archive electronic versions 
of the final year B.E project reports, dissertations of post graduate courses; Ph.D theses; 
lecture notes and publications by faculty, etc.  
d. The college/library w ebsite should be dynamic and regularly updated so that users can easily 
access academic news and other information.  
e. The AICTE has made a stipulation regarding the annual subscription of e -databases. It is 
found that of the Consortium databases some are hig hly used and some are used very little. It 
is recommended that the colleges should seriously take up this matter and have discussions at 
various levels to acquire and access selected and useful databases.

 Conclusion  
The study has succeeded in attaining its objectives. The analysis shows that a wide gap 
exists in all the colleges in terms of their digital information resources and services. It is also 
evident that digital/electronic information resources have undoubted ly established a presence in 
today's academic libraries. Digital libraries present opportunities and challenges for libraries, 
information communities and all stakeholders. It is clear from the survey findings that users have 
started moving towards digital  media from print media. The survey also reveals the fact that the 
college librarians should take an active role in providing modern IT facilities in the library by 
convincing the management and obtaining the necessary infrastructure for the best utilizati on of 
the digital information resources.  
 
In this study a sincere attempt has been made by the researcher to analyze the utilization 
of digital information resources in the self -financed Engineering Colleges of Karnataka. In the 
Consortium, the provided e -resources are not utilized equally. S ome of the resources are used to 
a great extent and some utilized very little. An evaluation of the usage of the e -resources is 
necessary for further implementation in the electronic databases under the VTU Consortium.   
And finally, the users are of the opinion that digital library services are better than conventional 
library services.
