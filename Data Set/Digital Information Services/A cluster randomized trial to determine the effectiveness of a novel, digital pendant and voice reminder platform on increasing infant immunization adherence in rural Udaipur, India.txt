Background: Five hundred thousand children under the age of 5 die from vaccine preventable diseases in
India every year. More than just improving coverage, increasing timeliness of immunizations is critical toensuring infant health in the ﬁrst year of life. Novel, culturally appropriate community engagement
strategies are worth exploring to close the immunization gap. In our study, a digital NFC (Near Field
Communication) pendant worn on black thread and voice call reminder system was tested for the effec-tiveness in improving DTP3 adherence within 2 monthly camps from DTP1 administration.
Method: A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in which 96 village health camps were ran-
domized to 3 arms: NFC sticker, NFC pendant, and NFC pendant with voice call reminder in local dialect.Randomization was done across 5 blocks in the Udaipur District serviced by Seva Mandir from August2015 to April 2016.
Results: In terms of our three primary outcomes related to DTP3 adherence, point estimates show con-
ﬂicting results. Two outcomes presented adherence in the control. DTP3 completion within two campsafter DTP1 showed higher adherence in the Control (Sticker) (74.2%) arm compared to the Pendant
(67.2%) and Pendant and Voice arms (69.3%). Likewise, the estimate for DTP3 completion within 180 days
of birth in the Control (Sticker) (69.4%) arm was higher than estimates in the Pendant (57.4%) andPendant and Voice arms (58.7%). However, one outcome displayed higher adherence in the intervention.
DTP3 completion within two months from the time of registration was higher in the Pendant (37.7%) and
Pendant and Voice arms (38.7%) compared to the Control (Sticker) arm (27.4%). In all primary outcomes,differences in adherence were statistically insigniﬁcant both before and after controlling for confoundingfactors. In terms of secondary outcomes, our results suggest that providing a necklace generated signif-
icant community discussion (H = 8.8796, df = 2, p = .0118), had strong satisfaction among users
(
v2=26.039, df = 4, p < .0001), and resulted in increased visibility within families (grandmothers:
v2=34.023, df = 2, p < .0001, fathers: v2 = 34.588, df = 2, p < .0001).
Conclusion: Neither the NFC necklace nor the necklace with additional voice call reminders in the local
dialect directly resulted in an increase in infant immunization timeliness through DTP3, the primary out-come. Still our process outcomes suggest that our culturally symbolic necklace has potential to be an
assistive tool in immunization campaigns. Follow-on work will seek to examine whether positive behav-
ior change towards vaccines can be fostered with earlier engagement of this platform beginning in theprenatal stage, under a continuum of care framework.

platform on increasing infant immunization adherence in rural Udaipur, India. Vaccine (2017), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.11.0231. Introduction
Immunization saves millions of lives against vaccine-
preventable diseases (VPDs). However, an estimated 23 million
children born every year do not receive proper immunization dur-
ing their ﬁrst year of life [1]. Worldwide, 1.5 million children under
the age of 5 die from VPDs. An estimated 500,000 of these children
die in India [2–4] after having gone non- or partially immunized
[3,5–7] .
Sociodemographic and geographic disparities pattern the land-
scape of immunization delivery [6,8] . The rural region of the
Udaipur district of Rajasthan has a full immunization coverage
rate of only 37.2% and has performed poorly in other key devel-
opmental indicators [9–11] . Drivers of under-immunization are
multifactorial: supply-side factors, demand-side factors such as
vaccine hesitancy, and critically, gaps in data collection con-
tribute to varying degrees. Our novel m-Health platform, known
as the Khushi Baby (KB) system, provides a streamlined digital
data collection system for frontline health workers that is
designed to support community engagement around child immu-
nization. This platform tracks child immunization history using a
mobile application and a durable Near Field Communication
(NFC)-powered necklace worn by the child, designed to retain
its data for years. The Khushi Baby pendant is culturally tailored,
as the black thread on which it is strung is commonly believed to
ward off evil spirits in the Udaipur community and many tribal
regions of India [12,13] . Health workers are equipped with NFC-
enabled devices, which contain the KB mobile application. When
a child is brought to a given immunization camp, the health
worker scans his or her necklace to automatically bring up the
child’s immunization history on the mobile application. The
child’s vaccination data is then synced to a cloud-based database
when cellular connectivity is available ( Supplemental Fig. 1 ).
With the KB cloud-dashboard, health administrators can send
automated voice call reminders in the local dialect to the
patient’s family.
The intended outcomes of this intervention were to increase
process efﬁciencies in the data collection chain and to improve
health behavior outcomes around immunization timeliness. To
date, few studies have rigorously evaluated mobile Health (m-
Health) innovations for vaccination record keeping, including the
usage of mobile phone image capture for secondary immunization
data collection and the use of NFC technology for global public
health in general [14,15] . While new technologies are being devel-
oped to address maternal and child health tracking in resource-
limited settings, these innovations need to be rigorously evaluated
for effectiveness in the ﬁeld – where real world implementation
constraints and cultural norms play a large role. The current study
seeks to systematically evaluate the Khushi Baby system’s adopt-
ability by mothers and the system’s potential to drive behavior
change around immunization timeliness with the primary objec-
tive of increasing DTP3 adherence in the ﬁrst 180 days after
childbirth [2,4] .
2. The present study
This study seeks to quantitatively examine the primary out-
come of timely DTP3 adherence amongst all 3 study arms and 3
key secondary outcomes of the Khushi Baby cluster Randomized
Controlled Trial (cRCT). Secondary outcomes will be based on
group comparisons of mothers’ survey responses that are indica-
tive of whether the necklace is visible, discussed, and accepted
by users. Two data collection tools were compared in this study:
the NFC sticker and the NFC necklace worn by the child.3. Materials and methods
The current study examines whether or not the KB intervention
improves timely health seeking behavior towards infant vaccina-
tion among mothers in rural Udaipur. While many health bench-
marks and evaluations utilize primary outcome measures of DTP3
or full immunization coverage [16,17] , timeliness is increasingly
being recognized as standard [16,18–20] . Infants in the research
cohort were tracked from the onset of registration into the KB sys-
tem. In this ﬁrst camp visit, the child receives the ﬁrst DTP shot,
meaning that two additional DTP shots would be required to com-plete the series. In this study, the primary endpoint was receipt of 3
DTP shots before 180 days after birth, as per WHO standards [4].
Secondary timeliness outcomes were also considered to account
for standards set by the Indian Academy of Pediatrics (receipt of
3 DTP shots by two months after receipt of DTP1 at registration,
spaced by 1 month), and to account for camp cancellations which
were not in the control of the beneﬁciary (receipt of DTP2 and
DTP3 in the two consecutive camps from the time of registration)
[21]. Due to limitations of the trial scope, outcome measures of
adherence through measles could not be considered in this study.
A focus on early vaccines, however, was considered relevant due
to increased mortality in early stages of infancy.
Randomization for this 3-arm cRCT was conducted on the
immunization camp level, which has a catchment area of up to
multiple hamlets from multiple villages. Ninety-six camps were
randomized evenly to 3 arms ( Fig. 1 ). Patients enrolled in the
study’s catchment area received their immunizations at vaccina-
tion camps held by Seva Mandir, a local NGO that is well estab-
lished in the Udaipur community. Baseline DTP3 coverage rate in
Seva Mandir camps was determined with a 30 cluster,
population-based probability sample survey conducted before
the trial began. An endline coverage evaluation was not performed
due to budget constraints.
3.1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The target population for this study included those living in
rural regions of Udaipur, Rajasthan, India. Descriptive statistics of
the study population can be found in Table 2 . All mothers with
an infant less than 6 months old in this population were assessed
for potential inclusion. Mothers are self-identiﬁed residents within
1 of the villages associated with the immunization camp. The fol-
lowing exclusion criteria was utilized: infants who already
received 1 or more DTP doses, mothers and infants intending to
move from the area in the next 6 months, and mothers without
mobile phone access were excluded from the Pendant with Voice
Call arm (P+V). All mothers who ﬁnished the DTP1-3 series and
took the exit survey ( Supplemental Table 1 ) were included in the
analyses regardless of timeliness of vaccination (camps are held
once monthly and the DTP series is meant to be completed within
two camps of receiving the ﬁrst DTP shot).
3.2. Study design and randomization
Control Arm: Near Field Communication (NFC) stickers were
placed on the existing immunization card. These stickers serve as
a digital record of the child’s immunization while retaining the
paper card that the mother currently uses. The sticker can be
updated via our app and allows for consistent methodology of
immunization data collection. Pendant Only: the immunization
record was digitally stored on a pendant with black thread, worn
by the child. Unlike the sticker, the pendant is visible, wearable,
and culturally signiﬁcant. Pendant +Voice Call Reminders: children
received the pendant as described above and mothers received2 R. Nagar et al. / Vaccine xxx (2017) xxx–xxx

with a missed camp message for mothers who failed to attend.
Ninety-Six Seva Mandir camps were randomized across 5
blocks in the Udaipur District to 3 treatment arms (sticker only,
pendant, and pendant + voice call reminder). The camps are situ-
ated in 5 Seva Mandir administrative regions: Badgaon, Girwa,
Kherwara, Kotra and Jhadol. A computerized random allocation
sequence was conducted with assistance from the Johns Hopkins
Bloomberg School of Public Health prior to enrollment, with bal-
ance analysis across all treatment arms ( Table 1 ). Mothers who
attended camps under randomization were offered a chance to
participate in the study. During pre-trial testing, 24 camps had
been offered a pendant. To minimize contamination, a computer-
ized randomization was performed to evenly distribute these con-
taminated pendants among the arms. A cluster randomized
approach was used at the camp level to minimize potential bias
of study arms [22].
3.3. Power analysis and enrollment
We aimed to enroll caregivers for 3 months and obtain an aver-
age of at least 3 DTP-naïve children per camp (assuming 70% DTP3
on time adherence rate in control arm, 80% power, alpha = 0.05, 32
clusters, ICC = 0.15, 10% refusal rate). Of the 96 targeted camps, 67
camps had at least 1 enrollment during the 3-month window. On
average, 3 participants were enrolled per cluster, with 24 clusters
in the sticker group, 21 clusters in the pendant group and 22 clus-
ters in the P+V group. Enrollment was conﬁned to 3 months and
held constant for all camps.
3.4. Study approval and statistical software
Statistical analyses were conducted on R 3.3 for Windows with
a p value of <.05 considered statistically signiﬁcant. Chi-squaredtests, t-tests with Bonferroni correction and logistic regression
were used to evaluate aforementioned primary and secondary out-
comes. Kruskal-Wallis tests (non-parametric ANOVA) were utilized
to assess the secondary discussion outcome. The current study is
approved by the Indian Institute of Health Management Research
I.R.B and registered with the U.S. National Institutes of Health
(NCT-02518178). All mothers enrolled in the study were willing
to give informed consent, with the study description read to the
participant orally and consent given via thumbprint.
3.5. Local partner
This study was supported by the cooperation of Seva Mandir,
our partner health service body, and remote data collection facili-
tated through the Khushi Baby mobile application and backend.
4. Results
4.1. Study duration and enrollment
The enrollment period had to be adjusted to the Seva Mandir
camp schedule. While the enrollment was slated to take place
between mid-August to mid-October, camp cancellations delayed
enrollment in some camps to October and November. The ﬁnal
month of enrollment was December 2015. Mothers in the study
were followed up until endpoint (child receiving DTP3) or com-
pletion of the trial, whichever came ﬁrst. Mothers who ﬁnished
their child’s immunization after the 2-camp period were consid-
ered late and a failure to adhere as per the primary outcome,
and mothers who did not ﬁnish DTP3 for their children by the
end of the study were considered a loss-to-follow up and a failure
to adhere ( Fig. 1 ). Follow up was concluded at the end of February

platform on increasing infant immunization adherence in rural Udaipur, India. Vaccine (2017), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.11.0234.2. DTP3 vaccination adherence
Each study arm received intended treatment (or control) and
was analyzed for the primary outcomes of DTP3 adherence. Pri-
mary outcomes included ﬁnishing by 2 months after DTP1, ﬁnish-
ing by 2 camps after DTP1 (to account for supply side failure such
as interrupted camps), and ﬁnishing DTP3 within 1890 days of
birth, as per WHO standards [2]. The results of all following statis-
tical tests and regressions are found in Tables 3 and 4 , respectively.
To determine the effect of treatment on DTP3 adherence, we con-
ducted a variety of chi-squared tests for each primary outcome. No
tests showed a signiﬁcant effect of treatment arm on DTP3 vaccina-
tion adherence. Fig. 2 agrees with this ﬁnding; survival analysis
illustrates consistent proportions of time to complete DTP3 across
all study arms. Further, to conﬁrm that the underlying effects of
our treatment were not masked by confounding factors, we built
logistic regression models including the effects of covariates.
Covariate inclusion was determined by a combination of thefollowing criteria: (a) valid theoretical basis for inclusion, including
individual factors, camp-speciﬁc factors, time-bound factors, and
hierarchical clustering at the camp level (b) uneven distribution
among treatment arms (See Table 1 ), and (c) non-zero coefﬁcient
ina priori lasso regression. Our ﬁnal logistic regressions agreed
with the chi-squared tests; there was no signiﬁcant effect by treat-
ment arm on these outcomes, even after controlling for potential
confounding factors and effect modiﬁers ( Table 4a–4c ).
3.3. Discussion level, user satisfaction, and visibility
To assess the inﬂuence of the KB necklace on community dis-
cussion, user satisfaction, and visibility, we analyzed the results
of post hoc survey questions ( Supplemental Table 1 ). Of the 198
observations combined in the 3 arms, 125 (63.1%) gave survey
responses; these data were used in the below analysis. Missing val-
ues were distributed evenly across each arm of the study ( Table 3 ).
The results of all following statistical tests are also found in Table 3 .Table 1
Baseline characteristics of participants who completed the DTP1-3 series (n = 128). Relevant chi-squared tests (p-value reported) on difference in means are provided to
demonstrate distributional balance across arms.

Please cite this article in press as: Nagar R et al. A cluster randomized trial to determine the effectiveness of a novel, digital pendant and voice remi nder
platform on increasing infant immunization adherence in rural Udaipur, India. Vaccine (2017), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.11.023Our proxy for measuring discussion level in the communities
was the response to the question: ‘‘How many people did you
show or discuss the necklace with?”. Since assumptions of normal-
ity are violated, we opted to conduct a Kruskal-Wallis test, the non-
parametric equivalent of ANOVA, in order to test signiﬁcant differ-
ences in this response with respect to each arm of the study ( Sup-
plemental Fig. 2 ). As demonstrated by the Kruskal-Wallis test, we
observed signiﬁcant differences in this response across the arms
of the study ( Table 3 b). As further evidence, we also conducted
chi-squared tests on each of the 3 possible pairwise combinations
of treatment arms ( Table 3 c). We observed signiﬁcant differences
between P vs. Control (Sticker) and P+V vs. Control (Sticker). We
did not observe a signiﬁcant difference in the P vs. P+V comparison
(Table 3 c).Fig. 3 illustrates the results of these statistical tests.
To assess general satisfaction around the data collection tools,
we analyzed responses to the survey question: ‘‘What is your gen-
eral reaction to the necklace/sticker?”, which had possible
responses, ‘‘very good”, ‘‘good”, ‘‘bad”, ‘‘very bad”, and ‘‘no reac-
tion”. We only observed responses ‘‘very good”, ‘‘good”, and ‘‘noreaction”; thus, ‘‘bad” and ‘‘very bad” are not included in further
analysis. A chi-squared test of independence identiﬁed a signiﬁcant
relationship between mothers’ general reaction to the data collec-
tion tool and treatment arm ( Table 3 b). We further tested pairwise
comparisons in this survey response; after Bonferroni correction,
we observed a signiﬁcant difference in the proportion of ‘‘very
good” responses in the P+V versus Control (Sticker) comparison
(Fig. 3 ,Table 3 c).
Finally, our assessment of visibility included analysis of the fol-
lowing 2 questions: (1) ‘‘Has the grandmother of the family seen
the necklace?”, and (2) ‘‘Has the father of the family seen the neck-
lace?”. Both questions had binary ‘‘yes” or ‘‘no” responses. Again,
we tested the signiﬁcant effect of treatment through chi-squared
tests. These tests both demonstrated a signiﬁcant relationship
between treatment arm and grandmother/father visibility. Fur-
thermore, we conducted t-tests on the pairwise comparisons
between P vs. control and P +V vs. Control (Sticker). We again
observed signiﬁcant differences between the treatment and con-trol arms of these tests after Bonferroni correction. There was no
signiﬁcant difference between the P vs. P+V comparison.
5. Discussion
The results from the current study suggest that the novel, cul-
turally speciﬁc NFC necklace promotes discussion and increased
satisfaction with the data collection tool amongst mothers in rural
Udaipur. Our ﬁndings further demonstrate that the necklace is
more likely to be retained than the paper card (3/141 mothers
needed replacement necklaces, whereas 7/62 mothers required
replacement cards through the DTP3 follow-up), demonstrating
adoptability and portability. While the primary outcomes exhibit
a null result with regard to DTP3 adherence, the process outcomes
show increased satisfaction, discussion, and acceptability amongst
enrolled mothers with general implications for long-term adopt-
ability of the NFC necklace as a health record in rural India.
We expected to see the Pendant + Voice Call arm increase DTP3
timeliness for the average mother, after controlling for confound-
ing factors, when compared to both the Pendant only arm and
the Sticker arm. The rationale for this hypothesis was that the
necklace could act as a social tool for engagement, and that the
voice call reminders could lead to fewer missed immunization
appointments, especially for enrolled mothers who presented with
low health awareness. We expected both of these mechanisms to
outperform any one alone, and we had expected the Sticker to be
a proxy for status quo practices for data collection and community
engagement. While we did not see effects on health behaviors, we
did see supportive evidence in process outcomes, which showed
high satisfaction, high retention, zero rejection, and increased
levels of discussion surrounding the pendant as a tool for immu-
nization. It is possible that the translation of these process out-
comes to health behavior change outcomes did not take place
due to remaining barriers or due to a lack of study duration. Fail-
ures in implementation of our voice call system may also have con-
tributed to the lack of observed effect ( Fig. 1 ).Table 2

Please cite this article in press as: Nagar R et al. A cluster randomized trial to determine the effectiveness of a novel, digital pendant and voice remi nder
platform on increasing infant immunization adherence in rural Udaipur, India. Vaccine (2017), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.11.023Motivating preventative health seeking behavior, especially for
vaccinations, has theoretical challenges beyond the scope of this
intervention. Not only does the mother face a tangible opportunity
cost of lost wages, but the cost is further magniﬁed when consid-
ering economic models of future discounting [23]. Moreover, a
mother’s lack of awareness of the long-term effects of vaccination
provides little incentive to see her child in distress without knowl-
edge of future beneﬁts.
We acknowledge that in our catchment area, some mothers
do not attend immunization camps at all and were therefore inel-igible for study enrollment. These defaulters make up a largercontingent of those who may be considered vaccine hesitant
[24–28] . With vaccination programs, the process of contextualiz-
ing and adapting formal program rules to local socio-cultural
conditions is intended to lessen the challenges of vaccine hesi-
tancy [29]. Services must be accessible and affordable, rigorous
adherence must be maintained, and trust must be established
to decrease perception of vaccination harm and mitigate factors
attributed to vaccination hesitancy [30]. While the KB system
cannot address all of these implicit structural barriers, it does
present a new kind of social incentive, as well as a reminder,to reinforce good health behaviors.Table 4b

Please cite this article in press as: Nagar R et al. A cluster randomized trial to determine the effectiveness of a novel, digital pendant and voice remi nder
platform on increasing infant immunization adherence in rural Udaipur, India. Vaccine (2017), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.11.023Anderson et al. reported the value of dialogue-based incentives,
identifying that discussion increased childhood vaccination uptake
of measles and DTP vaccination in Pakistan [31]. Moreover, dia-
logue can serve as an educational tool for vaccinations with health
education having a positive effect on maternal knowledge, and
childhood immunization practice. [32]. Communication tools such
as voice call reminders have been shown to increase immunization
adherence. For example, a randomized trial in rural Pakistan with
reminder-recall intervention in low-income and under-
vaccinated populations reported signiﬁcantly increased effects for
DTP3 adherence [33]. Indeed, the Khushi Baby platform draws on
these themes and builds upon prior work in the region, and our
process outcome ﬁndings contribute to the existing literature [34].
The current study has several noteworthy qualities. This is the
ﬁrst pilot study to test this novel intervention systematically in arandomized design to minimize confounding variables, and with
clustering to minimize contamination. The study did not rely on
verbal recall or incompletely marked paper records to assess vacci-
nation status. Finally, mixed methods were employed in the design
and evaluation of this intervention, including close work with the
target community before the trial initiation.
This study is not without limitations. While we explored the
possibility of enrolling mothers during the prenatal period, this
was not possible due to budgetary, technical, and implementation
constraints. In the next phase of our work, we plan to extend our
theory of change to engage mothers in care earlier (during preg-
nancy), to further improve their health-seeking behavior and
increase full immunization completion for their children from
birth to beyond the ﬁrst year of life. The sample size was small
and presented limited follow-up duration. There were supply-
side failures in both immunization camps held and voice calls
delivered. Neither surveyors nor nurses were blinded to the treat-
ment arms. Data collection gaps were noted: 9 children in the
cohort were missing from the backend and two in the backend
were not in the research cohort. The analysis did not control for
seasonal trends across years and did not have access to a reliable
baseline coverage rate. Potential selection bias for the P+V arm
was also an issue due to uneven distribution of mobile phone
access among all 3 arms, but this imbalance was controlled for in
the regression analysis.
Generalizability of the study is limited to the sample frame of
Seva Mandir serviced villages, all of which were included in the ini-
tial randomization. Seva Mandir services the hardest to reach
regions of rural Udaipur, serving as a stopgap to failures of rural
government health delivery. Stress testing the intervention in such
camps is more likely therefore to prove robust elsewhere in the
broader rural District of Udaipur. Cultural signiﬁcance of the black
thread in the necklace has been observed well beyond the region ofUdaipur [12,13] .
6. Conclusion
Although we did not observe signiﬁcant differences in DTP3
immunization adherence and timeliness, we do have substantial
evidence demonstrating overall community acceptance of our nov-
el, culturally speciﬁc NFC necklace. Current evidence from our
study indicates that the NFC necklace is likeable and promotes dis-
cussion. This has general implications for its future use as a
dialogue-based incentive. Indeed, the fact that the necklace works
at least as well as the sticker control, but with less information loss
and high levels of acceptability, may alone justify its use. This is
especially true in rural regions, where data loss is a heightened risk
compared to areas with high vaccination rates. A follow-on cRCT is
being conducted to further validate our system and to elaborate on
further mechanisms for behavior change and process outcomesalike ( Supplemental Fig. 3 ). On balance, our pendant demonstrates
a positive potential to act as a digital key for NFC enabled health
and social services for a more connected and healthier population
in rural and urban regions alike. The challenge moving forward is
to implement innovative yet locally appropriate strategies to
increase positive behavior change toward immunization in these
communities and beyond.
