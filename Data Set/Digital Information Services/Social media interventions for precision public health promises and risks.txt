Social media interventions for precision public health:
promises and risks

Social media data can be used with digital phenotyping tools to pro ﬁle the attitudes, behaviours, and health outcomes of people.
While there are a growing number of examples demonstrating the performance of digital phenotyping tools using social media
data, little is known about their capacity to support the delivery of targeted and personalised behaviour change interventions toimprove health. Similar tools are already used in marketing and politics, using individual pro ﬁling to manipulate purchasing and
voting behaviours. The coupling of digital phenotyping tools and behaviour change interventions may play a more positive role in
preventive medicine to improve health behaviours, but potential risks and unintended consequences may come from embeddingbehavioural interventions in social spaces.

INTRODUCTION
In 2013, a series of new methods were published demonstrating
the possibility of using Facebook ‘likes ’to predict aspects of
personality and demographics.
1–3These experiments showed the
ease with which individuals can be pro ﬁled using the digital traces
they leave behind online, and generated interest among
academics as well as commercial and political organisations. Then
in 2017, we saw experimental evidence that these tools can be
wielded for the purposes of social manipulation,4as well as
evidence that tools based on these methods were being deployedat unprecedented scales to manipulate voting in elections.5News
about the way Cambridge Analytica accessed and used Facebook
data remind us not only that our personal data can be leveraged
to inﬂuence our behaviour, but also that the regulatory and ethical
frameworks around those activities are underdeveloped.
To understand the role that similar approaches might play in
preventive medicine, we examine studies in which social media
data are used to predict or model health-related behaviours and
outcomes. We then explore how these methods might be
operationalised in the design of precision behavioural interven-
tions, and how the effects of these interventions might be
ampli ﬁed or lead to unintended consequences when delivered in
a networked public.
FROM CHARACTERISING POPULATIONS TO INDIVIDUAL
PROFILING
Changes in the way people live and communicate have made it
possible to access data about when people sleep,6when and
where they exercise,7,8and track the information they engage
with online.9Researchers have used these data in two ways:
aggregated to identify signals of population-level outcomes, and
at the individual level to predict personal attributes from linked
data. Both forms rely on robust measures of behaviours, attitudes,or health outcomes, but the ways they are operationalised to
change health behaviours are different.
Population-level studies that aggregate publicly-accessible data
have demonstrated the capacity to model spatial variations in
voting behaviours,10cardiovascular mortality,11and vaccine
coverage.12Studies tend to use Twitter when larger volumes of
data are required.13These types of studies are validated against
traditional data sources including surveys, disease noti ﬁcations,
and census data. In most cases, data from social media platforms
produce a biased representation of location or demography.14,15
Accounting for biases in data are important in studies that
conclude about incidence and prevalence without validating
models against other data sources (especially social media studies
that draw conclusions based on number of tweets).16Because
studies examining associations between what can be observed onsocial media and health outcomes have so far been limited to
high-prevalence conditions and behaviours like cardiovascular
mortality and vaccine coverage,
11,12it is not yet clear whether
social media data can be used to reliably model rarer outcomes.
Population-level studies can be operationalised to complement
traditional public health surveillance with faster and less costly
information; but tend to produce shallow information and are
blunt instruments for designing communication interventions.
Individual-level studies that predict attitudes, behaviours, and
health outcomes of people work differently, linking social media
user data to validated survey instruments or health records, often
using much smaller cohorts. An early example demonstrated the
ability to predict major depressive episodes from Twitter data and
used validated survey tools to establish diagnoses.17Mental
health has become a common topic of focus,18,19though other
attitudes, behaviours, and health outcomes have been studied in
similar ways.2,20There are no barriers to extending these studies
to other phenotypes.21While this approach can work with much
smaller cohorts than population-level studies, their construction

Published in partnership with the Scripps Translational Science Instituteand validation rely on the quality of the instruments used to
measure attitudes, behaviours, and health outcomes of the
participants. We expect that this approach will work across major
social media platforms and make it possible to detect reasonablesignals of suicidal ideation, the misuse of prescription drugs,problem gambling, unhealthy diets, vaccine hesitancy and refusal,
and lifestyle factors associated with increased risks of cancer and
cardiovascular disease.
DELIVERING INTERVENTIONS WITHIN A NETWORKED PUBLIC
Effective behaviour change interventions in ﬂuence the attitudes
people hold and the choices they make about their health or thehealth of their community. Traditional approaches might see agovernment or public health organisation address problems of
vaccine coverage by conducting a survey on vaccine hesitancy to
guide the design of a communication intervention; or usepopulation level data about healthcare services to allocate moreresources to locations with poorer access. Social media presentsan unusual opportunity to identify and deliver personalised digitalinterventions in an integrated way,
22,23and there is evidence that
this form of personalised social manipulation can be effective.4
When undertaken with individual consent from participants, suchbehaviour change approaches will live or die based on the meritsof their effectiveness. It is a very different question to contemplate
deploying such online personalised interventions at scale, without
consent, and where targets of the intervention are unaware thatthey are being manipulated.
The challenges associated with delivering and evaluating
population-level digital behaviour change interventions comefrom the networked nature of online social spaces. Borrowingfrom Tufekci,
24a networked public refers to the complex
interactions of people within a society, using communicationtechnologies that facilitate the formation of communities (asstructure), as well as the spread of information through thosecommunities (as dynamics). When designing communicationinterventions to work in social spaces where people are
concurrently consumers and broadcasters of information, interac-
tions in the network may be potential confounders or part of theintervention.
22
The ﬁrst challenge is evaluation —we are only starting to
grapple with the experimental designs needed to test such
interventions in trials and in natural settings. Observationalevidence shows that health behaviours can be partially explainedby the health behaviours and outcomes of families and friendsmeasured in egocentric social networks, including for behavioursrelated to obesity, smoking, and happiness.
25–27Trials that can
separate and control for the effects of social network structuresare still relatively rare.28Early evidence from studies that insert
software agents into arti ﬁcially-constrained social network struc-
tures demonstrate the potential to drive collective behaviour
change,29though recent work suggests the form of experiments
that may test effectiveness in natural settings.30
The second challenge is implementation —social networks may
supress or amplify the effects of behaviour change interventionsin unpredictable ways. Interventions in this space must competefor attention in an information-rich environment where misinfor-mation may spread faster.
31Experiments in agent-based simula-
tions and observational data from social media show that evenwhere individuals have the capacity to discern between high andlow quality information, an increased volume of information leadsto an increased likelihood that low quality information will spread
and persist.
32Online social spaces may also amplify the effects of
behaviour change interventions. For example, trials testing theeffects of messaging interventions aimed at in ﬂuencing vaccina-
tion attitudes often fail to show an effect on behaviour,33,34but
this may be because they are tested on individuals in arti ﬁcialenvironments rather than in the social spaces where information
credibility and beliefs are socially constructed.35,36
RISKS AND UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES
Backlash is a possible short-term consequence of the use of
automated behaviour change tools. The public reaction to an
interventional study where Facebook manipulated what users sawto determine its effects on mood was emblematic of what canhappen when users discover that they have little control over the
information they consume.
37Increased use of these methods may
represent an erosion of privacy and with it, a perceived threat toindividual autonomy.
Medium term consequences might include driving unhealthy
behaviours underground. Marlinspike,38in 2013, described how
the perceived erosion of privacy that comes with public knowl-edge of expanded surveillance can create a chilling effect on
behaviours, and the importance of privacy even for those who
believe they have nothing to hide. Social media users routinelydescribe using pain drugs, stimulants, and alcohol online. Whenusers discover that organisations are monitoring and manipulat-
ing their behaviour, they may adapt by obfuscating what they say
or how they interact to avoid being targeted (e.g. when hatespeech was targeted on Twitter, users started to use codedlanguage). This would make social media a less reliable signal of
behaviour.
Longer term risks may occur if the development of social
manipulation methods outpaces the development of counter-
measures, where users ﬁnd ways to hide distinguishing features or
limit what they share in the public domain. While there arelegitimate reasons for developing and deploying automatedbehaviour change interventions on social media to improve
health, new research efforts in the area could be adapted for use
in commercial or political applications. This includes organisationsunconstrained by the ethical standards required within academicenvironments. For example, Cambridge Analytica is suspected to
have adapted research from social psychology in an attempt to
manipulate voting patterns.

RESEARCH BARRIERS AND OPPORTUNITIES
Given the capacity to scale precision behaviour change interven-
tions to societal levels, clear governance structures are now
needed to allow for their safe and ethical use. Within academia,
ethics reviews will need to consider not only transparency andalignment with participant values but also the broader impact thatreporting may have on society. The 2014 experiment in which
Facebook modi ﬁed timelines was an example where users gave
consent by agreeing to the terms and conditions of use of thewebsite but the balance of risks versus bene ﬁts of changing their
timelines to manipulate their emotions may not have war-
ranted.
37,39Facebook is not alone. Large internet companies are
known for continuously running large numbers of experiments(called A/B tests) without explicitly informing participants. But we
typically do now view their impact in the same way because
behaviours they seek to change are typically clicks and conver-sions rather than behaviours that may have direct healthimplications.
The immediate opportunity in the area comes from linking
social media data to surveys and medical records, turning smallbut high-quality datasets into tools for predicting whichindividuals are most at risk of certain behaviours or outcomes at
societal scales. Methods for iteratively re ﬁning predictive models
to better target Facebook users are available,
40and these are likely
to improve identi ﬁcation further. The key difference is that social
media also permits direct communication with people that have
been traditionally hard to reach,41,42and to reach them well
before they visit a clinic or hospital.Social media interventions for precision public health y

Questions remain about when it is appropriate to couple tools
for digital phenotyping with targeted communication inter-
ventions to in ﬂuence health behaviours. There is evidence that
digital phenotyping tools have already been weaponised forpolitical propaganda —we have gone from dropping pamph-
lets from planes to delivering tailored messages directly into
the devices that dominate our attention. While the research
area is still in its infancy, examples from outside publishedresearch leave little doubt that we can take advantage of social
media to deliver fully automated, targeted, and cost-effective
behaviour change interventions a t scale. Despite the volume of
health-related social media research published, only a handfulof studies have demonstrably pre dicted health behaviours and
outcomes for individuals. While there is a clear potential for
their use in improving health outcomes, there are also risksthat the adoption of new tools in the area may lead to aperceived threat to autonomy and backlash. Until researchers
have the capacity to evaluate them in well-designed studies
demonstrating that the bene ﬁts outweigh the risks, we
recommend caution in their d eployment in preventive
medicine and public health.
