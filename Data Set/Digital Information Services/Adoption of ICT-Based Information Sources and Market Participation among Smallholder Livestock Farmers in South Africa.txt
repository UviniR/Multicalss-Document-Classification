Abstract: The study explored the contribution of information and communication technology
(ICT)-based information sources to market participation among smallholder livestock farmers. Use of
ICTs is considered paramount for providing smallholder farmers with required market information,
and also to reduce market asymmetries. A double hurdle regression was utilized to analyze data
collected from 150 smallholder livestock farmers in the study area. The results show that while use
of ICT-based market information sources signiÔ¨Åcantly inÔ¨Çuenced market participation, the e ect of
using ICT-based information sources on the intensity of market participation was not signiÔ¨Åcant.
Other variables shown to inÔ¨Çuence both market participation and the intensity of market participation
were age, additional income and membership of farmer cooperatives. This suggests the need to
consider other associated factors in the application and design of interventions that utilize ICT-based
information sources to achieve market engagement among smallholders.

1. Introduction
It has been widely reported that information and communication technologies (ICTs) assist in
disseminating information to farmers. This indicates that smallholder farmer‚Äôs need for relevant and
timely market information can be met using ICT-based information sources [ 1,2]. This has resulted in the
development of platforms that use ICTs for disseminating market information to farmers in many African
countries. These aim to address the perceived lack of market information, especially among rural smallholder
farmers. ICT-based information sources available to smallholder farmers in South Africa include radio,
television, mobile-phones, and computers with internet. Proponents of ICT-enabled market information
sources envisage ubiquitous information systems that are capable of widespread distribution of market
information and result in increased accessibility and the participation of smallholder farmers in markets. This
begets the question of whether using ICTs for market information search contributes to increased participation
in markets among smallholder farmers. While there are arguments related to the availability , accessibility ,
costs and benefits from using relevant ICTs, the requirement of smallholder farmers for relevant information
is undisputed. While ICTs may not be considered as a solution to all the market challenges of smallholder
farmers, they can make a meaningful contribution, especially for information-impacting decisions. The use
of ICT-enabled market information sources is associated with increased market transparency through the
provision of current market information, while simultaneously improving incomes and leading to other
welfare outcomes. However, the currently available studies have mostly examined how ICTs contribute to
Agriculture 2020 ,10, 44; doi:10.3390 /agriculture10020044 www.mdpi.com /journal /agricultureAgriculture 2020 ,10, 44 2 of 13
improving farmers‚Äô access to market information [ 3,4], their adoption of production technologies [ 5,6] or the
associated livelihoods effects of its use [ 7]. Although some studies have explored the link between market
information and commercialization, such as [ 8], the effect of adopting ICT-based information sources on
market participation among smallholder livestock farmers in South Africa remains a grey area.
Access to market information is considered a key institutional factor that a ects the participation
of smallholders in markets. The information enables producers to make economic decisions regarding
market interactions, either to purchase or sell, and hence enhances their comparative advantages.
Farmers therefore require accurate and timely market information to improve their knowledge of the
market, as this knowledge provides a fairer spread of the anticipated receipts accruable from a better
organized market price formation for all market actors.
In the literature regarding transaction costs, commentators have observed that better market information
reduces transaction costs, and also stimulates market participation among smallholder farmers [ 9‚Äì11].
A common opinion suggests that a lack of market information hinders participation in the market among
smallholder farmers by increasing their search, screening and bargaining costs. Other costs associated with
transactions include the cost of monitoring and ensuring adherence to the terms of agreements, and the costs
of adapting to changes in the market environment. These costs are especially significant for smallholder
farmers, and occur irrespective of whether a sale or purchase is finalized.
The transaction cost concept has been utilized to explain many economic phenomena, and is
regarded as central in highlighting and mitigating market failures in agriculture. Transaction costs
encompass various deÔ¨Ånitions and meanings, including the cost of searching for information, the cost
of using the price mechanism, and the cost of exchange, among others. It is a catch-all phrase that
is applied to explain the variety of costs involved in the transfer of ownership, the running of an
economic system [ 12], or it can be considered as a direct cost incurred when engaging in any market
transaction. Due to the e ect of transaction costs on smallholder farmers, market advocates have called
for interventions that reduce these costs [ 13]. These interventions include the provision of adequate
market information, which encourages increased farmer participation in markets.
Arming the importance of market information for smallholder farmers, Janowski et al. [ 14]
submitted that the provision of basic market information increases agricultural market e ciency,
and also contributes signiÔ¨Åcantly to market participation. Conversely, poor access to market
information increases both personal disadvantages and inimical choices, and is a discouraging factor
in market participation among this group of farmers [15,16].
Lack of market information is considered a big challenge in the livestock sector, especially among
rural smallholder farmers in South Africa, as it has been noted [ 17] to be positively and signiÔ¨Åcantly
related to their probability of selling livestock. This results to their continued exclusion from formal
markets due to low o -take rates, and increases dependence on informal marketing channels where
they receive low prices. Hence, the increased use of ICTs has potential for fostering improved business
opportunities or market activities [18].
According to Okello et al. [ 19], the cost of obtaining relevant information a ects the decision to enter
markets and exacerbates existing disparities. Furthermore, the information source also contributes to the
decision-making on market participation. Informal information sources such as relatives, friends and
fellow farmers are also a major information source among farmers, and are considered e ective in
the provision of relevant information that contributes to their market participation. Although the
availability of information generally a ects market participation, Martey [ 8] posits that the directional
eect of the market information variable di ers with the type of information source. This study
therefore explored the link between utilization of ICT-based information sources and participation in
markets. Few studies have focused on how the use of ICT-based market information sources inÔ¨Çuence
the market participation of smallholder livestock farmers, as most have reported mainly on crop
farmers [ 20‚Äì22]. Also, many of the available studies that have focused on the factors inÔ¨Çuencing market
participation among farmers have not emphasized the contribution of market information sources
in determining participation [ 23‚Äì25]. Hence, Souter [ 26] articulated the importance of informationAgriculture 2020 ,10, 44 3 of 13
sources while outlining the di erent values that farmers ascribe to various communication methods
and channels. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to investigate whether using ICT-based
information sources contributed to market participation and the intensity of participation among
targeted smallholder livestock farmers.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Analytical Framework
This study adopted the double hurdle model as its main analytical framework. This decision
was inÔ¨Çuenced by studies on factors inÔ¨Çuencing market participation that consider it a two-stage
decision process. These studies utilize variants of two main approaches including a selectivity model
introduced by Heckman [ 27], and the hurdle model pioneered by Cragg [ 28]. The literature provides
analytical methods for determining cause-e ect relationships, with the most common being the
two-step selectivity models for discrete and continuous decisions reported in [ 29]. The two-stage
econometric method outlined in [ 30] is based on the ordered probit and tobit models, and current
methods for analyzing the e ect of identiÔ¨Åed variables on market participation were incorporated
using the truncated, binary and multinomial regression models [30‚Äì33].
2.2. SpeciÔ¨Åcation of Model
We followed the assumptions in the double hurdle model, where market participation is generally
analyzed using a two-step approach. The farmer first needs to decide whether to, or not to participate in the
market before deciding on continued participation. Therefore, market participation is commonly assumed
to involve two independent problems, the initial problem is a personal decision made by the farmer whether
to participate or not (considered as the first hurdle), and the second problem is the obvious intensity of
participation, measured by the quantity sold in or purchased from the market (seen as the second hurdle).
The double hurdle model is a form of parametric generalization of the p-tobit model, in which
market participation and the intensity of participation are determined by separate stochastic processes.
First, a probit model of market participation (MKTPAT) for the selection equation is obtained using a
function of the explanatory variables, which also determines market participation intensity using one
or more exclusion variables. A truncated least squares regression equation of the MKTPAT intensity,
which closely resembles the tobit model is employed in a second step. An inverse mills ratio (IMR)
predicted from the probit regression is then included as a regressor to account for the selectivity bias.
The regression equation thus deÔ¨Ånes the latent variable MKTPAT
i:
MKTPAT
i=Zi+eieiN(0, 1) ( First hurdle ) (1)
MKTPAT i=1 ifMKTPAT
i>0, and MKTPAT i=0 ifMKTPAT
i0
where MKTPAT iis a categorical variable that takes the value of 1 if a smallholder livestock farmer
participates in the market, and 0 if otherwise.
According to [34], a probit model of MKTPAT iwhich follows random utility is expressed as:
Pr(MKTPAT i=1Zi,)=F(h(Zi,))+ei (2)
where MKTPAT iequals 1 for households that participate and 0 otherwise. Zirepresents the vector
of ICT-based information sources; , is the vector of parameters to be estimated; Fis a standard
normal cumulative distribution function; and eiis a random error term hypothesized to be distributed
normally with unit variance 2and zero mean.
In the second step (hurdle), the generated sample selection term IMR from the probit model (Ô¨Årst
hurdle), which accounts for potential selectivity bias is then utilized as an exogenous variable in the
truncated model regarding MKTPAT intensity, as described by [35].Agriculture 2020 ,10, 44 4 of 13
The second stage ( MKTPAT intensity) equation is expressed as:
E(Qi/MKTPAT =1)=f(Zi,)+!(second hurdle ) (3)
where Qis the quantity sold in the market and is the observed response on intensity; Eis the expectation
operator; Eis a vector of the ICT-based information source; is a vector of parameters to be estimated;
is the IMR, which accounts for sample selection bias in the probit model; and !is the associated
parameter to be estimated.
The IMR can hence be calculated as:
='(h(Zi,))
F(Zi,)(4)
where'(.) is the normal distribution and Fis the cumulative density function. Therefore, Qcan be
expressed as follows:
Q
i=0Zi+!i+i,iN
0,l2
(5)
whereiis a random error term with zero mean and variance l2; and Q
iis the observed response on
quantity sold (MKTPAT =1), in which case Q=Q
i. The truncated estimation of Equation (2) with the
inclusion of, gives consistent estimates and accounts for selectivity bias [ 36]. A primary limitation of the
double hurdle method is the decomposition of the effects of the first hurdle onto the second hurdle [ 37],
which occurs in the process of interpreting the results. Therefore, to mitigate this problem, the maximum
likelihood function is usually incorporated alongside the partial effects and standard error term as shown
in [38].

2.5. Data Types, Sources and Ethics  
Following an extensive review of the literature on market participation, the use of ICTs among 
farmers and related topics, a draft questi onnaire was developed. This schedule was pre -tested and 
amended as necessary before field data collection. The questionnaire was utilized to capture 
primary data from smallholder livestock farmer -respondents. The data collected comprised the 
socio -economic  characteristics of the respondents, use of identified ICT sources, livestock numbers 
owned, market information channels utilized and engagement with markets. A total of 150 livestock 
farmers were selected and interviewed for the study. The interviewed far mers were informed of the 
academic purpose of the data collection, and their consent was requested u sing a signed agreement 
form before the interview.  
2.6. Sampling, Sample Size and Analysis  
The Eastern Cape Province was purposively selected due to its leading status as the province 
with the largest number of livestock in South Africa. From the province, Alfred Nzo District was 
identified for convenience non -random sampling. A multi -stage procedure was utilized in 
identifying samples from the study popul ation and the collection of data. In the first stage, three 
local municipalities in the Alfred Nzo District were purposively selected based on the availability of 
information from the Department of Agriculture and their proximity. In the second stage, one Ward 
from each local municipality shown in Table 2 was randomly selected from a list of Wards available 
from the local municipal offices. In the third stage, 150 livestock farmers were selected after 
determining the requir ed sample size, as outlined in [ 42]. An adequate number of respondents is 
critical for any research, as a small number of respondents produce insufficient information for 
inference making  while too many respondents c an lead to findings of insignificant value while also 
wasting resources [43]. The total number of respondents for this study was hence calibrated to meet 
the confidence and precision levels required [44].

2.5. Data Types, Sources and Ethics
Following an extensive review of the literature on market participation, the use of ICTs among
farmers and related topics, a draft questionnaire was developed. This schedule was pre-tested and
amended as necessary before Ô¨Åeld data collection. The questionnaire was utilized to capture primary
data from smallholder livestock farmer-respondents. The data collected comprised the socio-economic
characteristics of the respondents, use of identiÔ¨Åed ICT sources, livestock numbers owned, market
information channels utilized and engagement with markets. A total of 150 livestock farmers were
selected and interviewed for the study. The interviewed farmers were informed of the academic
purpose of the data collection, and their consent was requested using a signed agreement form before
the interview.
2.6. Sampling, Sample Size and Analysis
The Eastern Cape Province was purposively selected due to its leading status as the province with
the largest number of livestock in South Africa. From the province, Alfred Nzo District was identiÔ¨Åed
for convenience non-random sampling. A multi-stage procedure was utilized in identifying samples

in the Alfred Nzo District were purposively selected based on the availability of information from
the Department of Agriculture and their proximity. In the second stage, one Ward from each local
municipality shown in Table 2 was randomly selected from a list of Wards available from the local
municipal o ces. In the third stage, 150 livestock farmers were selected after determining the required
sample size, as outlined in [ 42]. An adequate number of respondents is critical for any research, as a
small number of respondents produce insu cient information for inference making while too many
respondents can lead to Ô¨Åndings of insigniÔ¨Åcant value while also wasting resources [ 43]. The total
number of respondents for this study was hence calibrated to meet the conÔ¨Ådence and precision levels
required [44].Agriculture 2020 ,10, 44 6 of 13

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Demographic Characteristics of Respondents
The personal characteristics of the survey respondents are presented in Table 3, which shows that
male respondents constituted 64% of the total number, while 36% of the respondents were female.
Respondents aged less than thirty-six years made up only 7% of respondents; those between thirty-six
and Ô¨Åfty-Ô¨Åve years represent 33% of respondents, while respondents Ô¨Åfty-six years and older comprise
50% of the study population.

The data suggest that persons aged Ô¨Åfty-six and older constitute the majority of smallholder
livestock farmers in the study area. This Ô¨Ånding is in agreement with that reported in [ 45], and is
generally reÔ¨Çective of the age of the majority of smallholder farmers in rural areas of South Africa.
Among the survey respondents, 27% were single, 46% were married, and 27% were either
widowed or divorced. The number of persons in the respondent‚Äôs household was also analyzed.
This showed that 29% of the respondents had between two and four persons in the household.
The majority of survey respondents, about 53%, had between Ô¨Åve and seven persons in the household,
while 18% of respondents had between eight and ten persons in the household. Large household sizes
are common in rural areas, especially in the Eastern Cape Province, as extended families live within
the same compound.
Education levels varied among the respondents, with 17% having no formal education,
36% attended schooling for six years or less, while 20% attended schooling for a period of between 6
and 12 years. Respondents who had more than 12 years of formal schooling comprised 27% of the
study population. The data shows that among 53% of the survey respondents, approximately 36%
only had a primary education, with 17% of these respondents having no formal education. Most of
the respondents, approximately 87%, did not belong to any farmer cooperative, and only 13% were
members of a farmer cooperative.
The herd sizes among respondents varied widely and the data was compressed as a result to
narrow the range with a mean value of 83 animals. Herd size was determined by the total number of
livestock owned by the respondent, and the analysis show that 33% of respondents had less than 50
animals in total, 36% of respondents owned between 51‚Äì100 animals, while 31% of respondents had
more than 100 animals in their herd. Livestock ownership within the study area is considered as a
status symbol, with many households keeping di erent types of livestock.
3.2. E ect of IdentiÔ¨Åed Variables on Market Participation
The probit model result for market participation (MRKPAT) was used together with the truncated
model estimates for the double hurdle regression. As shown in Table 4, the signiÔ¨Åcant variables are age,
additional or o -farm income, membership of a farmer‚Äôs cooperative and the use of ICT-based source.

The farmer‚Äôs age was found to be signiÔ¨Åcant, but negatively correlated to market participation.
This Ô¨Ånding is supported by other studies such as [ 46,47], where signiÔ¨Åcant negative relationships
between age and market participation were reported, and contrasts with the view [ 48] that age is
an enabler of market participation. These authors allude to risk aversion and conservative attitudes
among older farmers versus the market-enthusiasm exhibited by younger farmers to elucidate the
negative correlation between age and market participation among some farmers.Agriculture 2020 ,10, 44 8 of 13
In this study, additional or o -farm income is signiÔ¨Åcant and positively correlated to market
participation. Although Barrett [ 49] also emphasized the usefulness of an additional income source in
overcoming market entry costs, a number of studies [ 50‚Äì52] have reported a signiÔ¨Åcant but negative
eect of additional income on the farmer‚Äôs market participation. However, this study corroborates
the Ô¨Åndings in [ 53], suggesting that an additional income from o -farm activity positively inÔ¨Çuenced
market participation, as well as the Ô¨Åndings of Lubungu et al. [ 54] who inferred that investing additional
o-farm income stimulated farm productivity, which translates into increased market participation.
The coe cient of membership of farmer‚Äôs cooperative had a positive and statistically signiÔ¨Åcant
impact on livestock market participation. Cooperatives have been found [ 55] to provide farmers
with requisite platforms for exchanging information, and to serve as a link to buyers at a lower cost.
These leads to improvements in their collective bargaining power and production capabilities [ 56,57],
while invariably lowering the transaction costs due to market participation. A similar Ô¨Ånding of the
positive inÔ¨Çuence exerted by membership of farmer‚Äôs cooperative or association has also been reported
in [58,59].
ICT-sources are considered indispensable for providing information related to livestock marketing
and market prices. The coe cient of access among livestock farmers to ICT-based information sources
had a positive and statistically signiÔ¨Åcant impact on market participation. Although there is agreement
regarding the importance of ICTs for market information, some studies such as [ 60] have reported
insucient evidence to indicate the inÔ¨Çuence of an ICT market information source on farmer‚Äôs market
participation decisions. Nonetheless, other Ô¨Åndings have shown the beneÔ¨Åts of using ICTs, and how
they constitute a viable approach for linking smallholders to markets [ 61‚Äì63]. The Ô¨Ånding of a
signiÔ¨Åcant positive inÔ¨Çuence of ICTs on market participation among farmers corroborates other studies
that have reported its additional welfare beneÔ¨Åts [ 64], eects on marketing decisions [ 65], and a
signiÔ¨Åcant positive coe cient on the quantity produced and price received [66].
The results from the truncated regression of market participation is reported in Table 5, and the
coecient of the inverse Mills ratio (IMR) was not found to be statistically signiÔ¨Åcant in this model,
implying that any bias due to self-selection could be discounted. The variables inÔ¨Çuencing intensity of
market participation among the smallholder livestock farmers are highlighted.

The variables driving the intensity of market participation were gender, age,
cooperative membership, marital status and o -farm income. Respondents‚Äô education, use of
ICT-based sources, household size and the herd size were not found to be signiÔ¨Åcant in the intensity of
market participation (a proxy for the amount received from sale). The independent variables found toAgriculture 2020 ,10, 44 9 of 13
be signiÔ¨Åcant a ected the direction of the dependent variable, and the result conÔ¨Årms the e ect of a
combination of variables in producing outcomes. As reported in [ 20], the interaction of variables such as
gender, membership of cooperatives and use of ICT-sources led to positive commercialization outcomes.
This position is also supported by other studies, for example [ 8], where the explanatory variables jointly
inÔ¨Çuenced the extent of market commercialization. Other relevant studies where combinations of
variables were identiÔ¨Åed as inÔ¨Çuencing market participation decisions, either positively or negatively,
among surveyed smallholder farmers include [23,35] and also [67].
While the use of ICT-based market information sources was not found to be signiÔ¨Åcant in the
intensity of market participation, the combination of gender, age, marital status, o -farm income and
membership of a cooperative led to more signiÔ¨Åcant market participation outcomes among smallholder
livestock farmers in the study area. This Ô¨Ånding corroborates the Ô¨Åndings of many other studies (for
example, [ 68,69]) that infer that di erent sets of factors signiÔ¨Åcantly inÔ¨Çuence market participation
and the intensity of participation decisions among farmers. This shows that decisions about market
participation and intensity of participation are a ected by di erent factors at various points in the
farmer‚Äôs decision-making process.
4. Conclusions
In this study, the key characteristics of smallholder livestock farmers that were found to
be signiÔ¨Åcantly associated with their market participation include age, an additional income,
membership of a cooperative, as well as the use of ICT-based sources, as determined by results from
the Ô¨Årst hurdle. However, as shown in the results from the second hurdle, among those participating
in markets, membership of a cooperative, having an additional income, marital status, gender and age
were found to be signiÔ¨Åcant in driving the intensity of market participation. Use of an ICT-based source,
as an independent variable, was not found to be signiÔ¨Åcant in the intensity of market participation.
This Ô¨Ånding is supported by similar studies, which have reported that market participation and
the extent of market participation decisions among farmers were determined by di erent factors.
This conÔ¨Årms that various variables are at play during di erent stages of the farmer‚Äôs decision-making
process. It is worth noting that independent variables such as age, additional income and cooperative
membership were found to be signiÔ¨Åcant in both the participation of farmers in markets as well as the
intensity of market participation, in this study.
The results of this study highlight pertinent issues that are relevant to improving market
participation among smallholder livestock farmers. Age, additional income source, and membership
of a cooperative all have important implications for interventions aiming to progress smallholder
livestock farmers on the commercialization pathway.
The Ô¨Åndings of the study are important for planning information-dissemination services using
ICT-based sources to smallholder livestock farmers, especially within the study area. As shown from the
results, market interventions should consider the target group of farmers based on factors such as their
age, membership of cooperatives and the possibility of earning an additional income. We recommend
the roll out of livestock intervention programs targeting young smallholder farmers, which among
others, provides improved breeds of stock and access to relevant input and infrastructure for marketing
as younger farmers have been shown to be enthusiastic and more willing to engage with markets than
older farmers. Furthermore, it is recommended that membership of cooperatives should be encouraged,
as the study results show that cooperative membership was signiÔ¨Åcant for participation in markets.
Additionally, it is recommended that planned interventions could support income-generation activities
among the targeted farmers, such as eco-farm-tourism projects and grass-fed produce certiÔ¨Åcation
for niche markets. Smallholder livestock farmers have shown the aptitude to use ICTs for sourcing
market information; it would therefore be practical to provide information related to livestock health
and management practices using this ICT media, which also reduces the need for physical visits from
livestock extension agents in the area.Agriculture 2020 ,10, 44 10 of 13
The study and its Ô¨Åndings have relevant implications for policy and practice, speciÔ¨Åcally in
interventions designed to promote market information usage, support uptake of relevant technologies,
and even in the dissemination of extension services among smallholder livestock farmers. While this
study used cross-sectional data, it is suggested that for future research, panel data or time series
data be used to provide a more in-depth analysis of the variables and how use of ICT-sources a ects
market participation and intensity of market participation decisions among this group of smallholder
livestock farmers.
