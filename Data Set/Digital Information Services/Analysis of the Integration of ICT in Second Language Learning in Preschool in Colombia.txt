Abstract  
The introduction of Information and Communication s Technologies (ICT) in the 
educational sphere is becoming more and more essential due to its potential as a 
pedagogical tool. This study  aims to evaluate  some factors that fa cilitate and hinder the 
pedagogical use of ICT in the context of learning English as a second language (L2) at 
preschool education levels. Through the methodology of Design Thinking, it is possible to 
structure the characteristics that a playful interface shoul d have in order to support this 
educational process and, especially, to satisfy the needs of an environment that intends 
to make the most of the technological resources it has. To this end, this methodology 
takes into account the experience of direct users (children), indirect users (teachers) and 
the socio -economic dimension of educational centres, headed by managers. In this sense, 
two ad hoc  questionnaires were completed  by the school executives and teachers, 
respectively, in a specific educational context of Barranquilla, Colombia. The 
questionnaires were administered  to 25 schools. Data analysis showed the importance of 
ICT in improving the teaching and assessment process. At the same time, it shows the 
levels of frustration of some teachers who us e technologies with low levels of training or 
with self -generated content that limit the use of ICT in an appropriate way. These results 
will outline a number of  characteristics that should be considered when implementing 
actions to improve the teaching of  English in the classroom using digital  tools.

1. Introduction  
There is a lot of data currently available about the impac t of Information and 
Communication s Technologies (ICT) on different aspects of the life structure of human 
beings. Education is undoubtedly one of them (Briones & Martinez, 1998). The 
transformation has occurred  in recent decades and has marked profound ch anges in terms 
of the transfer, processing and storage of information within learning  processes. Its 
impact has been so huge that the presence or absence of ICT demarcates a fundamental 
gap in educational  systems and at the same time  it has become a focus of interest for 
many governments in order to set strategies that  to diminish this gap  (Briones, 200 1, p. 
8).   
The integration of ICT into educational settings has proven to have significant benefits in 
terms of learning and has become increasingly interes ting in recent decades in different 
sectors of education. Magazines such as the NMC Horizon Report are a great reference in 
this subject. Year after year, this magazine studies the trends and challenges of education 
in terms of technological advances and i ts impact on learning, teaching and educational 
research, it analyses the dynamics of insertion and technological advances that demand 
much more educational staff who are up -to-date in the use of new technologies and who 
are capable  of integrating digital  pedagogies in a more profound way (Arribas, Gutiérrez, 
Gil, & Santos, 2014) so that the learning experiences in the classroom are truly significant.  
This ongoing research work frames the factors associated with the use of ICT in the 
classroom, within the  Colombian educational context. It is also in line with government 
training plans such as the National Bilingualism Programme (2004 -2019), which aims to 
develop competent individuals prepared for the globalised world, with the learning of 
English as a seco nd language (L2) as its key topic, and by doing so it can strengthen the 
development of language skills as a key factor that will represent a competitive advantage 
at the social and professional level in the future.  
Based on the assumption that establishe s a high (economic and social) profitability in 
education for early childhood development (Heckman, 2016), we will first evaluate 
teaching methodologies around the use of ICT and characteri se the population to develop 
a user profile with potential for the use of emerging technological tools such as Augmented 
Reality (AR), all within the framework of socio -economic variables of schools.  
After that,  we will review the context that circumscribes the population of our sample, as 
well as the background that cor roborates the relevance and the need to evaluate the 
environment where the insertion of new ICT is intended to be generated.  
2. The present study  
This study aims to assess the academic context of preschools so one can identify the 
factors that facilitate o r hinder the pedagogical processes of teaching the L2, and also to 
review what role ICT plays in  this endeavour .  
At the same time, it characterises the population based on the socio -economic variables 
that permeate each educational centre. This first phas e of the study seeks to measure 
the degree of importance of the use of ICT and its impact on education in schools.   
Based on the previous objective, research questions were drawn up to help outline the 
requirements that would facilitate the application of  teaching methods using ICT to 
promote learning the L2 in infant education.  These were:  The EUROCALL Review,  Volume 29, No. 1, 2021

3. ICT findings in second language learning  
3.1. Technological integration  
When we review the data published  by the government in its statistical information 
systems that gather relevant and detailed information from agencies such as DANE 
(National Administrative Department of Statistics), the Ministry of ICT and the Ministry of 
Education about the conditions concerning the use of ICT in education, the only factors 
we can find are those related to connectivity and the number of computers per student:  
Computers for education (CPE). However, if we want to review in detail the effectiveness 
of the use of ICT resources, beyond the possession of these, we do not need concrete 
information and it is necessary to delve into formal and non -formal sources in or der to 
obtain some data; many with important biases.  
In relation to technological resources, the Ministry of ICT in Colombia praises its work 
with the CPEs as the programme with the greatest social impact through ICT. Colombia 
went from having 24 children  per computer in 2010 to 4 children per computer in 2018 
(MinTIC, 2018). In Barranquilla, the figure went from 40 children per computer in 2010 
to 8 children in 2017 (President, 2016). This is one of the many indicators we have, but 
there is no information  in figures from other important resources. For this reason, it is 
necessary to review the usefulness given to them and how many of them support the 
learning of the second language in order to align with government program mes such as 
the GNP.  
3.2. Second l anguage (L2)  
According to the report developed by the Education Program of the Inter -American 
Dialogue and Pearson, called "Learning English in Latin America", there are several causes 
that hinder significant progress in the aspects that concern second la nguage  acquisition , 
however, above all it highlights the deficit of prepared teachers with a minimum level of 
English required. Colombia currently has a shortage of 3,200 teachers to cover its student 
population.  
Other sources of information, such as the English Proficiency Index  published by  
Education First  (https://www.ef.com/wwen/epi/ ), position Colombia as No. 1 7 out of  18 
Latin American countries evaluated, that is, with a "very low" level of competence.  
These results made the Colombian Government reconsider its English language learning 
policy and consequently become more committed toward implementing more proactive 
strategies. A major national education project was executed  whereby public children could 
start learning English at a very young age, as explained  by Rosa Maria Cely, manager of  
the Colombia Bilingüe  programme developed at the Ministry of Education . Her proposal  
reinforces the Government’s intention to change the low levels of performance achieved  
by public schools, as exemplified by the fact that only 5.6%  of the students reached  a 
pre-intermediate or B1 level of English in 2016 (Cely, 2017).  
4. Methodology  
For the present study, the strategy used was to collect mixed information: quantitative 
and qualitative. The design of the research method was structured with a descriptive 
correlational character.  
4.1. Data collection tool  
An ad hoc questionnaire was carried out with teachers and preschool directors for the 
educational context of Barranquilla, Colombia. The data collection instrument was 
developed using the above -mentioned research questions and all the protocols that would 
make it possible to assess the validity, reliability and practical usefulness (Albert, 2007) The EUROCALL Review,  Volume 29, No. 1, 2021 
 
 
 53 of the data collection process . The design of the instrument, in its first stage, was 
submitted to expert judgement to be later applied in a pilot test and to corroborate the 
levels of reliability of the test.  
The reliability validation was carried out on 36 of its 53 items, which cor responded to 
independent variables whose task was to provide answers to the questions posed, using 
a Likert rating scale (Always=4, Frequently=3, Sometimes=2, Never=1). The remaining 
17 items corresponded to exogenous identification variables (sex, age, ed ucational 
institution, years of existence, technological resources available, English level of the 
teaching staff, school typology and socioeconomic stratum).  
Those items of an independent nature were subjected to Cronbach's Alpha test, where a 
weighting of 0.851 was obtained. This score, according to psychometric analysis, is 
considered to be highly reliable (Cronbach, 1951).  
4.2. Sample characterization  
The sample of preschool teachers was taken from preschools in different socioeconomic 
sectors of the city of Barranquilla. With a total sample of N=25, 8.7% were male  and 
91.3% were female . 
The average age of  teachers was 36. Twenty percent were between 20 and 30 years of 
age, while  24% were between 30 and 40.

Numbe r of Teachers  25 
Average Age  36,17  
Standard Deviation  6,95 
Minimum Age  22 
Maximum Age  50 
 
 
According to the information provided by the teachers themselves regarding their 
training, 61% have only been trained at the undergraduate level. Seventeen per cent 
have specialized training and 22% have a master’s  degree.  
 
The years of experience that teachers had in preschool education were also observed. In 
this way, a correlation study was made between the factor of Professional Training and 
years of experien ce, so that it is possible to evaluate how this influences the degree of 
pedagogical innovation that teachers may have in the area related to ICT. Thus, we found 
an average of 11.26 years of experience, with a standard deviation of σ = 5.06. With a 
minimum  of 5 years and a maximum of 24 years. While the highest professional degree 
of master’s  is concentrated in the middle of the range of years of experience, the level of 
undergraduate professional training is similarly distributed throughout the range.

4.3. English proficiency levels: Teacher and educational institutions typology  
Bearing in mind that language proficiency in the second language is a key factor and that 
reports in Colombia  show a significant deficit in terms of teachers trained to the minimum 
required levels (B1 - B2), this section will show the situation of the sample selected in 
different preschools in Barranquilla. We will see how socio -economic factors affect the 
educat ional level of teachers in the second language through a correlation analysis of 
these factors. In the results, we can see that the level of English in relation to social 
stratification (in Colombia it is classified from 1 to 6, with 1 being the lowest and  6 the 
highest), concentrates its population in the lowest levels A1, A2 and B1 in strata 2 and 3 
(E-2, E-3). Stratum 4 still shows important deficiencies, with a third (33.4%) of its 
population between levels A1 and A2, although it advances a step forward , placing 
(66.7%) in level B2. Finally, the preschools that present teachers with a more advanced 
level of English are in stratum 5, with teachers of level B -2 (75%) and C2 (25%) and 
stratum 6, with 50% of teachers between B2 and C2 level respectively.

 55 4.4. Technology resources  
 
To understand the use of ICT in the teaching process, teachers were asked to recognize 
what types of technological resources their school had and which they could access. The 
results of this analysis were compared with the category of school: Public or Private. 
Graph 1 shows how 84% of these preschools have c omputers. Of this percentage, 64% 
(f.16) correspond to private schools and 20% (f.5) to public schools. Sixty -four percent 
(f.2) of these preschools have a web page, of which 8% (f.2) are in public schools  and 
56% (f.9) are in private institutions. 60% hav e screen projectors. Of this portion, 8% 
(f.2) is part of public schools and 52% (f.13) corresponds to private schools. Forty-eight 
per cent 48% claim to have and use multimedia material, they 4% (f.1) belong to public 
schools and 44% (f.11) belong to priv ate schools. 44% claim to have sound equipment 
in their classrooms, of which 8% (f.2) belong to public schools and 56% (f.9) belong to 
private schools. The resources below begin to be scarcer: Twenty -eight percent have 
microphones, of which 12% (f.3) corre spond to public schools and 16% (f.4) to private 
schools. Twenty percent said  they had digital panels, of which 4% (f.1) belonged to public 
schools and 16% (f.4) to private schools. Resources such as tablets 16% (f.4), specialized 
software 12% (f.3) and ca meras 8% (f.2) correspond only to the sector of private 
institutions.

5. Results  
5.1. Independent variables and their correlation  
 
Twenty questionnaire items were used as a reference to determine the  independent 
qualitative variables that measure the ideal conditions of a preschool, on a Likert rating 
scale (4=Always, 3=Frequently, 2=Sometimes, 1=Never) taking into account the 
following categories:  (1) the use of teaching materials and their character istics; (2) ICT 
resources and their implementation in L2 ; (3) the importance of using the senses to 
promote an inclusive environment , and (4) the curricular structure of the L2 . Accordingly, 
each variable was described as follows : 
1. Item1 (I -1) Considers the  use of teaching materials to be indispensable within the 
teaching process. Item 2 (I -2) Uses teaching materials in the teaching of the 
second language. Item 3 (I -3), Learners perform better when they use additional 
learning resources (learning materials o r digital resources - ICT). Item 4 (I -4) has 
resources that enable it to assess learners when they make use of didactic and/or 
support materials, in the teaching process.  
2. Item 5 (I -5) has technological resources for teaching the second language. Item 
6 (I-6) uses technological resources for teaching the second language. Item 7 (I -
7) considers tools that support the L2 teaching process by means of digital or 
The EUROCALL Review,  Volume 29, No. 1, 2021 
 
 
 56 technological resources to be useful. Item 8 (I -8), the curricular structure of 
second language teach ing programmes uses new information technologies as a 
means of promoting meaningful learning of the second language. The contents of 
the L2 programme include graphic representations to facilitate understanding and 
application of the new language. Item 10 ( I-10) has mechanisms to prevent 
possible learning difficulties for its learners. Item 11 (I -11), the technological 
platforms on which teachers must generate their own learning content appear to 
be frustrating. Item 12 (I -12) prefers platforms that have con tent that can be 
updated. Item 13 (I -13), technology resources promote teamwork.  
3. Item 14 (I -14) considers it important that learning support tools (didactic or digital 
materials) involve different senses: touch -to-sight, ear -to-touch, ear -to-sight. 
Item 15  (I-15), the bilingual teaching model promotes recognition of context and 
cultural diversity. Item 16 (I -16), the curriculum structure of second language 
programmes provides for flexible strategies for students with disabilities. Item 17 
(I-17) considers i t useful that teaching materials, whether physical or digital, used 
in the learning process should be inclusive.  
4. Item 18 (I -18) the contents of the second language teaching programme are 
aligned with Colombia's National Bilingualism Plan (PNB). Item 19 (I -19), the 
contents of second language teaching programmes are updated annually. Finally, 
item 20 (I -20), the sequence of contents taught in the classroom are distributed 
coherently in their units and themes.

The maximum rating scale of this test corresponded to a score of 144, with this 
compliance indicator of an educational environment that met the ideal conditions for the 
implementation of new ICT for education. Based on this score, the maximum scores (Q3) 
and the minimum scores (Q1) were analysed to assess the characteristics of the 
educational institutions w ith regard to the socio -economic conditions. From the sample of 
25, the teachers were assigned identifiers  (D) accompanied by the corresponding number. 
The relationship found , showed that those preschools with the most favourable conditions 
were among the top and had the category of Bilingual Schools, while the public ones, 
despite the government's efforts to provide resources, were placed in the last positions 
and socioeconomic strata.

 58 5. Conclusions  
 
In addition to the fact that soci o-economic conditions directly affect the quality of 
teaching, they also determi ne the use and implementation of ICT resources as a tool to 
facilitate the teaching -learning process.  
The teaching of the second language still proves to be exclusive. Those wi th the greatest 
purchasing power are those who have access to educational environments with the ideal 
conditions for learning an  L2. However, possessing ICT resources is not always directly 
related to the usefulness or good management of these resources. T his can be observed 
in the item results for  the independent variables related to category 2: ICT resources and 
their implementation in L2, where 84% of respondents considered ICT  tools useful for 
teaching an L2 (I -7), but only 48% (I -8) ha ve these resource s. It is also important to 
contrast the use of ICT for L2 teaching with the mechanisms for evaluating learning 
processes (I -4). This item was highly valued by 36% of teachers, which shows that there 
is a need to integrate not only ICT tools into the school  curriculum for L2 teaching, but 
also to incorporate mechanisms to monitor how they help to improve knowledge and 
language skills.  
The results open up the debate about  what requirements ICT  resources should have in 
view of the socio -economic needs of schoo l environments. In order to characteri se some 
aspects that hinder their use in school environments, the questionnaire was designed to 
assess the typology of ICT that have educational content for teaching. While 76% of 
respondents find technological  resourc es that require teachers to generate their own 
content frustrating (I-11), 80% prefer that the content be updateable. This variable is 
directly related to the levels of technological training and teacher training.

Ethical statement  
This research was carried out within the framework of anonymous ethnographic and 
educational data collection. Each of the persons surveyed voluntarily  submitted 
information related to their development as teachers, as well as their personal and 
occupational information. Each educational institution and each teacher were given a 
letter in advance which  explained the context and  the research purposes of the 
questionnaire.
