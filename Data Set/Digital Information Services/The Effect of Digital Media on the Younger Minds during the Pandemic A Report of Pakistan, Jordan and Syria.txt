INTRODUCTION  
We live in the era of digital media, and especially after 
lockdown and self -isolation, digital media has boomed 
tremendously. The easy availability, no time limitation 
and restriction, utility of having every news right in 
the palm of your hand, and the ease of communication 
has made it an essential part of life. Digital media, 
defined precisely as the use of social media and 
electronic press are considered  both a source of 
entertainment and a portal of "reach out" to raise 
awareness , propagate news and precautions, and, of 
course, the view ing and report ing critical current 
scenarios.   While , writing  this report , in Pakistan, there are 
296,149  confirmed cases of COVID -19 and 6298  
fatalities caused by COVID -19.1 However,  although 
the incidence might not be as high as in the United 
States and Europe, especially Italy and Spain , a rise 
may still be expected because of the continually  
mutating nature of the causative agent .COVID -19 has 
affected 210  countries2 and territories, and there ar e 
more than 2,355,853 cases of COVID -19 all around 
the world .3 In this time of social distancing  and 
isolation, people suffer from a lot of psychological 
impact . While there is a fear of the disease itself, there 
is also an apprehension of what might happe n in the

business, and education . Will things ever be back to 
normal again?  
 A human mind is a smart machine looking for all 
the answers from every corner.  Lip service and gossip 
have always played a part. It has now been upgraded  
in the form of digital media that has surpassed the era 
of the press.  
 While the importance of digital media cannot be 
denied, it is not less than a knife, which can be both a 
weapon and a healing scalpel depending upon the 
wisdom and  intent of its use. We want to enlighten 
further that no matter how sharp a knife is, it can never 
cut its handle!  
 Pandemics have always weighed heavily, 
considering the impact of their biological 
consequences of illness and fatalities. It expands to the 
psychological and mental health of the population, 
where many  studies have pointed out an increased 
incidence of REM sleep with COVID -19 related 
dreams/nightmares concerning anxiety and stated the 
occurrence of night terrors .4 Pandemic is still a time of 
uncertainty, dismay, apprehension , and fear. Since 
people isolate themselves in their homes, and many 
even have their loved ones locked away in different 
places, the negative impact is easy to predict.  
 Hence, we conducted this study to address the role 
played by the digital media on the psychological state 
of the Pakistani population consisting of people from 
all walks of life.  
 
MATERIALS AND METHODS  
Study Design

young, general population, especially the non -medical 
one. The link was shared on Facebook and WhatsApp 
groups.

 It was noticeable, that the younger age group of  
18 – 35 years suffered more psychological effects.  
Furthermore, the younger age group sp ent more hours 
on the  social, digital media. However, through all 
ages, there were no visible differences in the mean 
between males and females using the social media, so 
it seems in our study that both genders use digital 
media during the outbreak.  
 
DISCU SSION  
While we may conclude that digital  media is creating 
some unnecessary hype , we still cannot deny  the 
positive  impact  of digital media's proper usage , as we 
can share and reach out people in various positive 
ways in terms of increasing level of awaren ess, 
keeping up with the recent medical views based on 
experience regarding patient management, getting 
information, and attempting to find ways to intervene 
in the chain of transmission, finding a probable cure, 
sharing ideas with people, sending hope  to people who 
are ill or anxious about COVID -19, cheering up people 
left alone , helping out by raising funds and collecting 
food and equipment for people in need , doctors can 
perform their telemedical consultations, and you may 
also share your ideas in policy  making.  Furthermore, 
this was a way of teaching residents and students while 
they were at their homes through webinars, which 
gave them the access to high quality education materials, which w ere difficult  to access before  as it 
was difficult to meet those  panelists in  person due to 
their tight schedules or the expenses of travelling.  
 The younger age group was  affected the most for 
various reasons. This age group has a natural 
emotional tendency  to respond to environmental stress. 
This age group is also th e one where most people are 
at the crossroads  of their career and education so they 
have apprehensions for their future as well. 
Unfortunately the same age group uses digital media 
the most. There is also role of peer groups that discuss 
the happenings and  how it would impact their future. It 
is important to address this age group regarding these 
problems. There should be a plan to keep them busy in 
some productive work so they may divide their 
attention away the digital media and towards other 
happenings.  
 Thus, we want to share our view that digital media 
needs to be used wisely, and its excess should be 
avoided. Only reputable news portals should be used, 
and the negative hype is avoided. The WHO  has 
repeatedly warned  that COVID -19 related newstead to 
make one feel anxious and distressed . It is advised to 
minimize the updates to once or twice a day  at specific 
times and only from trusted sources . We want you all 
to kindly refer to  these guidelines by the WHO on 
psychosocial considerations during the pandem ic of 
COVID -19.5 While many people are relieved  knowing 
the fact that COVID -19 does not pose a  high risk of The E ffect of Digital Media  on the Younger Minds  during the Pandemic: A Report of Pakistan, Jordan and Syria  
http//www.pakjns.org          Pak. J. of Neurol. Surg. – Vol. 24, No. 3, Jul. – Sep., 2020          -274- fatality  in the healthy population compared to  the 
medically compromised one .6 According to the  WHO , 
this novel coronavirus strain  SARS -CoV -2 is a public 
health emergency of international concern  that has an 
impact not only being an infection but also 
psychologically  among the young and sensitive  
individuals.7,8 With the advent of  digital  media , the 
information delivery has been  drastically altered .9 In 
China, where  the outbreak was originally generated, 
even bolder headlines  were shared. Such pieces of 
information misled the public and  also caused  racial 
discrimination outside mainland.10,11 
 If we want to convey our concerns regarding the 
appropriate  use of digital media in the given uncertain 
circumstances, then being at the viewer end, we need 
to modulate media use according to its impact on our 
mind. We need to educate people on how to use digital 
media and how to react. Instead of feeling 
disappoi nted, one should learn to respond by trying to 
find a solution how to mitigate the feared 
consequences. We should devise our way of using 
digital media most constructively. For example, 
several of us from all around the world gathered and 
designed to broad cast educational videos for the 
resident doctors who are now deprived of daily rounds, 
made Facebook  groups to convey information 
regarding COVID -19, unique dedicated blogs to keep 
the people entertained, mostly the elderly ones who 
were isolated alone, an d there are also several other 
ways to introduce more positivity.  
 
CONCLUSION  
We cannot deny the useful impact of social, digital 
media as well as it is the only portal of communication 
and an effective educational tool especially during 
these challenging times.  But, the social, digital media 
are also affecting  the younger age group 
psychologically.  
 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT  
A special nod of appreciation is for  the doctors on the 
frontline world wide; it is a matter of great honor and 
pleasure to see how true to the oath the doctors have 
proven themselves to be. Fulfilling the attribute of the 
nobility of our profession is the most significant 
responsibility we have got. We wish safety for 
everyone who is taking part in health delivery, and we 
hope one day we will be back to our routine after 
defeating this menace.  Special thanks to mentors, friends  and colleagues  at Harvard University,  Tishreen 
University and Hashemite Medical University.
