Digitalization and migration: the role of
social media and migrant networks in
migration decisions. An exploratory study
in Nigeria
Chinedu Obi, Fabio Bartolini andMarijke D ’Haese
Abstract
Purpose –This paper aims to explore the connectivity between social media use, access to migrant
networks, information asymmetry and migration intentions.
Design/methodology/approach –The study was conducted using data from individuals living in
Nigeria and analysed with a generalized structural equation model, which is rare for this kind of research.
Findings –The authors find a dual mediating role of the social media and the migrant networks in
facilitating migration, i.e. reducing the threshold cost required to migrate and introducing a bias in termsof information asymmetry. While social media and access to migrant networks directly increase migration
intentions, this changes when incomplete information is provided. People who use social media and their
migrant networks for information are more likely to have information about destination countries than
information on the transit risk.
Social implications –The study adds valuable insights for designing awareness campaigns aimed at
reducing irregular migration.
Originality/value –This study contributes to the understanding of the intersection of migration and
digitalization

1. Introduction
The traditional explanation of drivers of international migration is often centred on
rational choice and utility maximization theories ( Arango, 2000 ). Migration studies
that are built on these theories maintain that economic expectations, risk attitudesand household behaviours are important elements of migration decisions (
McKenzie
et al. , 2013 ;Migali and Scipioni, 2019 ;Ullah, 2016 ). The shortcoming is the neglect
of the facilitating role of intermediaries like networks and digital technologies.
Digitalization –the use of digital technologies in communication such as social
media –is one of the transformations in today’s world that improves information flows
and awareness among people. It can also influence migration decisions ( Dekker and
Engbersen, 2014 ).
In this paper, we investigated how the increased information flow and awareness,
thanks to social media, affect migration decisions in Nigeria. We started by giving abrief overview of the literature on how potential migrants communicate with migrantnetworks via social media. We provided a theoretical framework from which we deriveChinedu Obi is based at the

is a good case to study migration decisions. This is because the country is a highmigrant-sending country and among the top social media user countries in the world(
Connor and Gonzalez-Barrera, 2019 ;Kemp, 2019 ). While studies have shown the
relevance of social media and migrant networks on migration decisions and outcomes
(Alpes, 2017 ;Dekker et al. ,2 0 1 8 ;Fokkema and de Haas, 2015 ;Mu¨nz, 2018 ), the case
of Nigeria is yet to be explored.
2. Social media, migrant networks and migration decisions
Emerging studies are increasingly associating development processes, includingdigitalisation and social transformations as important elements of migrationdecisions (
Cooke and Shuttleworth, 2018 ;Flahaux and De Haas, 2016 ). These new
elements are said to enhance people’s access to migration information, as well as
improve their aspirations and capabilities to migrate ( Carling and Talleraas, 2016 ).
The role of migrant networks as primary sources of migration information istransformed by the availability of digital infrastructures (
Dekker and Engbersen,
2014 ). Social media stand out among other digital tools like telephones, TVs and
radio, as they enable a real-time transfer of migration information between migrant
networks and potential migrants in a relatively cheap and easily accessible manner.Social media and migrant networks are mediating factors that act as informalsources of information. They also decrease the transaction costs of migration. Social
media strengthen the ties between potential migrants and migrant networks (
Dekker
and Engbersen, 2014 ). They play the role of communication channels, providing
insider knowledge about destination countries ( Gelb and Krishnan, 2018 ;Gillespie
et al. , 2016 ). Migrant networks use social media to facilitate migrants’ travelling
(Mu¨nz, 2018 ) and to coordinate less risky routes of migration ( Boas, 2019 ). By doing
so, they potentially lower the threshold level of wealth required to migrate. Theyenhance migration aspirations even amongst people with low capabilities to migratevia legitimate routes.
The magnitude of which social media and migrant networks facilitate migration can be
mitigated by the access and the accuracy of the information they provide.
Pimmer and
Tulenko (2016) explained that the use of social media for communication is hindered by the
economics of participation, technical competencies and issues of privacy, surveillance andinformation quality.
Dekker et al. (2018) added that access to social media is uneven in a
society due to the costs attached to it. Jointly, these issues limit the number of times
potential migrants communicate with migrant networks via social media. However,increasing levels of human capital (and additional forms of capabilities) such as havingstrong ties with migrant networks, knowledge, income and positive attitude to social media
could help to overcome these constraints (
Dekker et al. ,2 0 1 6 ;Kaplan et al. , 2016 ). The use
of social media for migration purposes can improve by a positive perception of itsusefulness (
Callahan et al. ,2 0 1 8 ). Having a positive disposition towards technology and
social media, in particular, induces one to use social media for migration information
search. Yet, the messages that come through social media may be riddled by rumours and
camouflage the risks associated with the journey. The accuracy and completeness of theinformation from social media and migrant networks is a challenge. Migrants who sourceinformation through these informal sources are often less or incorrectly informed, and
usually face sociocultural exclusions in destination countries (
Alpes, 2017 ;Dekker et al. ,
2018 ;Fokkema and de Haas, 2015 ).
Certainly, the mediating role of social media and migrant networks in facilitating
migration is complex and it is receiving some research interest. However, to the bestof our knowledge, no study has estimated the multiple and interrelated connectivity
between the use of social media, having access to migrant networks, information
PAGE 6jDIGITAL POLICY, REGULATION AND GOVERNANCE jVOL. 23 NO. 1 2021accessibility and accuracy challenges and how they all affect migration intentions of
people.
3. Theoretical framework
Two theories are relevant to this research. The first is the aspiration-capability framework ( Carling
and Collins, 2018 ;Schewel, 2020 ). This framework considers that people who have the aspiration
to migrate but do not have the capabilities to do so legitimately may seek assistance fromnetworks. Here, social media become a platform for the potential migrants to seek for informationfrom networks, migration brokers and smugglers. The challenge is that these people may offer
false or less information to the potential migrants for selfish interest. The second theory is the
theory of migration under incomplete information (
Allen and Eaton, 2005 ;Berninghaus and Seifert-
Vogt, 1987 ). This theory shows that having less information is an attractor to migrate, rather than a
dissuasion for highly motivated and risk-neutral people ( Allen and Eaton, 2005 ). This is particularly
a concern for many economic migrants moving through irregular routes. They are often young
people who are willing to take risks with the hope that migration would lead to enhanced quality of
life (Mbaye, 2014 ). As such, even when these young potential migrants receive incomplete
information, they may likely want to try their luck (Kleist and Thorsen, 2016 ). Migration decisions
under incomplete information are often made in error, capable of leading to a regrettable andavoidable migration experience (
Beam et al.,2 0 1 6 ;Benson Marshall et al., 2020 ;Musto and Boyd,
2014 ). These avoidable outcomes include irregular migration and human trafficking ( Fiedler, 2019 ;
Frouws et al., 2016 ).
Based on these two theories, we argue that although social media and migrant networks
may provide information that could improve capabilities to migrate, they may be spoiled byrumours, which we regard as incomplete information in the rest of the paper. We, therefore,develop a set of three hypotheses on the links between social media, migrant networks,
incomplete information and migration decision:
H1. Social media and migrant networks are important informal sources of migration
information that could enhance the migration aspirations of people with lowcapabilities to migrate through legitimate routes.
H2. The potentials of social media and migrant networks in facilitating migration can be
constrained by the incompleteness of information.
H3. The incomplete information disseminated by social media and migrant networks
could lead to a wrong migration decision.
4. Methodology
4.1 Study area
Our hypotheses are tested using exploratory data collected from individuals in
Nigeria. Irregular migration from Nigeria presents a challenge for policymakers(
European Migration Network, 2018 ). Its surge could be associated with the increased
use of social media, which have improved the ties between potential migrants,
migrant networks and human traffickers. Most migrants that move irregularly expectthat Europe will offer them better opportunities than Nigeria. Yet, evidence has shownthat they face life-threatening risks in transit and destination countries (
UNICEF,
2017 ). In transit, irregular migrants are exposed to a constant danger of being
kidnapped, tortured for ransom, endure modern-day slavery and death ( Horwood
et al. , 2018 ). In the destination countries, irregular migrants are vulnerable to
sociocultural exclusion especially when they do not have a legal permit of stay(
European Migration Network, 2018 ). As most of the potential migrants depend on the
information provided by informal sources social media, they often fall into the risk of
incomplete information, which increases the likelihood of irregular migration.
VOL. 23 NO. 1 2021 jDIGITAL POLICY, REGULATION AND GOVERNANCE jPAGE 74.2 Data collection
The data were collected from an internet-based and a paper-based survey. The
internet-based survey was conducted using a public invitation on Facebook. Thecriteria for the internet survey were straightforward, which is, the respondent shouldbe a Nigerian, living in Nigeria. The survey was initially promoted on Facebook for onemonth. Those who completed the survey were encouraged to share the link withpeople in their network. We expected to reach a large number of participants throughthe internet-based survey with relative ease. In the framework of this paper, it has anadditional advantage considering that it allows reaching potential migrants who usesocial media on regular bases in search of travelling opportunities. Despite theseadvantages, the challenge of an internet-based survey is its reliability and quality ofthe responses. For instance, in our survey, only about 220 responses were completeddespite the over 500 attempts to start the questionnaire.
A paper-based survey was added to increase the reliability and sample size of the survey. It
was purposively conducted in Edo state. Edo State was selected because it is a widelyknown hub for irregular migration in Nigeria. By oversampling Edo state, we could target apopulation that has a high likelihood of irregular migration. The data were collected in theState capital (Benin). Two trained enumerators administered the questionnaire. The way thedata were collected mimicked the internet-based data collection procedure. Here, theenumerators moved around the city and randomly search for respondents who are willing toparticipate in the study. The respondents were also encouraged to recommend otherpeople within their networks who may be willing to participate. A hundred respondents filledthe paper-based survey, bringing the total number of respondents to 320. The internet andpaper-based data collection were based on snowball sampling procedure. Though this
method may increase the risk of sampling error and affect the representativeness of the
study, it was handy, easy and a cost-effective way to collect the exploratory data used inthis paper. This sample size is within the range (30 to 460) that is recommended for astructural equation model (
Wolf et al. , 2013 ).
Migration intention is the main dependent variable in our analysis. The migration
intention-question identifies the subset of the respondents who aspire to migrate.They expressed a wish or desire to migrate, including those that are consciouslyseeking ways to migrate as well as those that do not yet have a plan. We posed therespondents the following question:
Q1. Ideally, if you could afford it, would you like to move to another country, or would you
prefer to continue living in Nigeria? The options include 1. Yes, move permanently to
another country, 2. Yes, move temporarily to another country, and 3. No, continueliving in Nigeria.
The independent variables include migrant networks, social media use, socioeconomic
factors and migration information. A migration network is defined as a web of social ties thatconnects individuals in the origin countries with migrants in destination countries. Thenetworks are capable of influencing the migration flows from origin to destination countries(
Garip and Asad, 2015 ). The migrant network of a person can be just one person or several
persons. However, the strength of the existing ties is often regarded as more influential thanthe number of ties (
Dekker and Engbersen, 2014 ). Therefore, migrant networks are defined
here as having access to at least one person living abroad on which one can count to helpin facilitating migration. The answers to the following question were used to capture therespondent’s access to a migrant network:
Q2. Do you have a relative or friend abroad whom you could count on to help you
migrate? A binary response was provided: yes, (1) assumed that the respondent has
access to a migrant network; No (0) means they do not have access to a migrant’snetwork.
PAGE 8jDIGITAL POLICY, REGULATION AND GOVERNANCE jVOL. 23 NO. 1 2021Following Dekker and Engbersen, (2014) , we define social media as any digital or
mobile application containing user-generated content. This includes open and semi-
open applications enabling social networking and communication, e.g. Facebook andMyspace, YouTube, Twitter and WhatsApp (
Dekker and Engbersen, 2014 ). The
questionnaire had four questions probing the level of social media use and the
perception of the usefulness of social media for migration information. The first (andkey) question is:
Q3. How many hours do you spend on social media in a day? Options include up to 1 hr
(1), 2 to 5 h (2), 6 to 10 h (3), more than 10 h (4).
A second question enquires on the medium of communication that the respondent
regards as very important in being informed about migration. Possible answers
include social media, television, radio, phone and newspaper. Based on the answers,
we made a dummy variable on which respondents that agree that social media isimportant for them scored a one. The third question asks which of the followingmediums the respondent uses in communicating with the migrant networks: post,
phone, and social media. The respondents who agree to use social media as a
medium of communication score one on a new dummy we created based on thisquestion. Finally, we also asked about the type of information the respondent is mostlyinterested in when checking the social media. Options include opportunities abroad,
political news, celebrity news, chatting with friends, and sports. As in the previous
questions, we developed a new dummy on which respondents who use social mediato check for opportunities abroad score 1, others scored 0 on this variable.
The migration information received by the respondents is an important variable in our
research. Complete information is expressed as knowing the risk and realities in the
transit and the destination countries. Based on the information we gathered from
focus group discussions organized with some Nigerian immigrants and asylumseekers living in Italy, we asked respondents to rate their knowledge on sevenmigration issues. We asked the respondents to rate how well they thought to be
informed on the following irregular migration risks (expressed in terms of per cent): 1.
Irregular migration involves a long stressful journey in the Saharan desert; 2. Irregulartravellers may be robbed, raped, maimed, killed on the way; 3. Many of the transitcountries are facing internal conflicts and wars; 4. Many irregular travellers can be
subjected to harsh labour condition like slavery; 5 Many people die in the
Mediterranean Sea due to overcrowded boats; 6. On arrival, irregular migrants arekept in camps in Europe; and 7. Most European laws are harsh to irregular migrants.Finally, the questionnaire also gathered information on the respondent’s
socioeconomic characteristics.
Table 1 gives the summary statistics of the data used in the analysis. Most of the
respondents are less than 30 years old, and the majority is unmarried. Almost equalnumbers of men and women were interviewed. Most of the respondents are educatedand living in urban areas. The sample included almost equal numbers of students,
people seeking employment and people employed. Most of the employed
respondents earn between low and medium-income levels. More than 85% of therespondents have not travelled out of Nigeria, and about half of all the respondentshave social ties with at least one relative or friend that is living abroad. Generally,
there is a high level of migration intention among the respondents; about half said
they have the intention to migrate temporally to another country, and a third said theyintend to migrate permanently.
We checked the social media habits of the respondents, particularly if theyconsciously use social media to search for migration information. About half of therespondents said they spend between 2 to 5 h on social media a day. Our results

respondents. Social media is a dominant medium used by a majority of the
respondents to communicate and maintain social ties with family and friends abroad.Moreover, social media is used by almost half of the respondents to search for
travelling opportunities abroad.
We analysed the level of migration information possessed by the respondents by
asking them to rate in percentage the extent they have information on seven migrationissues. We found that the respondents rate their average information level at 75%.This means that at least one in four issues raised in our questionnaire that affects
irregular migrants are not known by the respondents. How the different states of
information affect the migration intention of people is of paramount concern to ourresearch, which is explored further.
4.3 An analytical approach using a generalized structural equation model
We model the relationships between the variables described above using a
generalized structural equation model (GSEM) ( Figure 1 ). A GSEM is used when
systems of linear and non-linear equations are needed to show the relationshipsbetween latent and observed variables. It is composed of two parts: a structural path
that measures the constructs and explores the links, and a confirmatory factor
analysis (CFA) that models the latent variables. It is an advanced model of structuralequation model (SEM) and it uses the power and flexibility of both SEM and
generalized linear models in a unified modelling framework that fits multilevel
dependent variables ( Lombardi et al. ,2 0 1 7 ). While a SEM is simpler and can show the
goodness of fit, it can only model generalized linear response variables. A GSEM canmodel sophisticated multilevel mixed-effects and accommodates continuous,

SEM to analyse the impact of social networks and norms on a two-response levelmigration intention question, we use a GSEM in our study considering that our main
response variable –migration intention is a categorical variable of three levels
(intention to move permanently, temporarily or no migration). In our model, migrationinformation is treated as a latent variable that is captured by the seven-migration riskquestions listed above.
We consider two states of migration information, namely, information on the transit andinformation on the destination. A CFA was used to reduce the seven-migration questionvariables to these two components (states) of information.
Table 2 present the factor
loading for the CFA. The Kaiser –Meyer –Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy (KMO) is
0.87, which is above 0.5. Barlett’s test of sphericity is significant. These suggest that the
CFA meets the basic criteria to continue the analysis.
The GSEM model is comprised of three equations representing the three hypotheses
(Figure 1 ):
1. e1–is a structural equation explaining the factors affecting access to social media. The
variables include socioeconomic characteristics, access to a migrant network and theperception of the usefulness of social media for migration information. This part of the
analysis was conducted using an ordinal logit analysis.
2.
e2–is a structural equation explaining how social media and a migrant network leads to
incomplete information. Ordinary least squares models were used for this analysis.
3. e3–is a measurement equation explaining how all the constructs in the equations
influences the migration intention of the respondent. A multinomial logit model was
used.
We used the post estimation results from the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and
Bayesian (or Schwarz) information criterion (BIC) to compare different specifications of our
model. We considered the model with the smallest AIC and BIC values to be the best
(Akaike, 1987 ;StataCorp, 2019 ). The model is then reported as the final model. Fisher’s
hypothesis testing framework was applied throughout the analyses. The GSEM estimated
the models jointly. To allow for an easy interpretation, we describe the results of each model
separately.

with changing degrees of use of social media ( Table 3 ). The socioeconomic
characteristics that are significantly associated with a higher level of social mediause include being a student, unemployed, receiving a high salary and residing in
urban areas. Earning high income and living in an urban area are important
capabilities that help a person to overcome the economic and technical constraintslimiting social media use. As the economic status of individuals changes from beingstudents or job seekers to being employees, the number of hours spent on social
media significantly decrease. Surprisingly, having access to a migrant network is
not a significant predictor of social media usage. However, we note a positive andsignificant use of social media amongst respondents that have a favourableperception of the usefulness of social media for migration issues. These include the
respondents that perceive social media as important for migration information and
those that consider social media as a communication channel with friends andfamilies abroad.
5.2 Social media, migrant network and incomplete information
We analyse the possible existence of incomplete information among the respondents
using a CFA. The result predicts two components of respondents that can be
conveniently disintegrated by the state of migration information they know. The firstcomponent represents the respondents that have more knowledge about thechallenges en route , which we labelled “transit information”. The second group of
respondents are more knowledgeable about what is attainable in the destination
countries, and we labelled them “destination information”. The occurrence of thesetwo states of information suggests the possibility that respondents may be betterknowledgeable in one state of information but have poor knowledge of the other state.
It is based on this thinking that we assume that social media and migrant networks
may have a differential impact on the level of each information state a respondent has.Hence, we tested the second hypothesis of the study that social media usage andmigrant networks would influence each state of migration information differently
(
Table 4 ). The results confirm our hypothesis. We found that social media usage and
access to the migrant network have a significant inverse association with thepossession of information on what happens en route , and a significant positive
association with having information on the destination. This means that social mediaTable 3 Factors in ﬂuencing social media use ( n= 320)

the opportunities upon arrival than risk on transit.
5.3 Social media, migrants network, incomplete information and migration intention
Finally, we investigated how social media use, access to migrant networks, the two statesof information and socioeconomic factors affect migration intention. The analysis was
conducted using a multinomial logit model involving three migration options, namely,
permanent migration, temporal migration, and no migration (
Table 5 ). We found that
having access to a migrant network and using social media is directly and positively
associated with permanent and temporal migration intentions. The results also show an
indirect link with migration intention when the information provided by the migrant
networks or social media is incomplete. In this link, having more information about the
transit than information on the destination can positively influence the decision to migrate,
but having more information on what is obtainable at the destination has an inverse
relationship with migration intention. This result is robust to the inclusion of
socioeconomic variables and the perception of the usefulness of social media. The
socioeconomic aspects show that the intention to migrate is positively associated with
being younger, being a male, having high skills but lower-income, living in rural areas,
having no previous migration experience, and coming from Edo State. More so, thoseTable 4 Impact of social media on incomplete information ( n= 320)

6. Discussion
We explore the potential and constraints of social media and the migrant networks asinformal sources of migration information. A majority of the respondents in the surveyare young, knowledgeable and use social media extensively. Of course, this isexpected as about 70% of the data were collected through the internet-based survey,and as such, our findings relate more with the sub-set of the population who arecapable of using social media. There is a very high level of migration intention amongthe respondents, and we suspect it to be linked with the increased use of social
media. This may be because social media give them a cheap and easy way of
communicating with their migrant networks as well as with migration brokers.
Dekker
et al. (2016) showed that online communication supports migration aspiration and
decision-making. Kaplan et al. (2016) also explained that having a migrant network
could increase the migration intention. The mediating role of social media infacilitating migration found in our study also agrees with previous studies (
Gelb and
Krishnan, 2018 ;Gillespie et al. ,2 0 1 6 ). Social media is considered:
/H17039as a provider of general information and knowledge about migration;
/H17039as a communication channel between potential migrants and migrant’s network, which
also help them to maintain social ties; and
/H17039as a source of insider information on travelling opportunities.
The constraints to the use of social media are numerous ( Pimmer and Tulenko, 2016 ).
However, human capital achievements or capabilities such as having a high level of
education, a relatively high economic status, being located in an urban area andhaving a strong positive perception of social media enables them to overcome theseconstraints. This corresponds to the concept of self-selection in migration, whichpostulates that migration positively selects among those with high capabilities suchas high skills, education or earnings (
Bertoli et al. , 2013 ;Borjas et al. ,2 0 1 9 ). The
relatively higher capabilities possessed by this group could be the reason why some
people can migrate, and others are not, even when everyone is faced with hardshipsat home. Social media and migrant networks, therefore, could be essential qualifiersof migration. This position also agrees with the aspiration-capability framework thatsuggested that networks are important elements that enable some potential migrantsto overcome the structural constraints that impede migration (
Carling and Schewel,
2018 ;Carling and Talleraas, 2016 ). Although we did not find that having a relative or
friend abroad leads to a higher likelihood of social media use as expected, this shows
the possibilities that social media also provide opportunities to communicate withthose that do not share strong ties with the respondents such as migration brokersand human traffickers, who also offer information on travelling opportunities (
Alpes,
2017 ).
Another area that our research touches is the individual migration decision-making
process and attitude to risk. A traditional explanation of the migration decision-
making process often considers migration as a household decision for riskdiversification (
Stark and Bloom, 1985 ). The combined efforts of the household
members tend to minimize the risks associated with migration. Some householdmembers could contribute money, while others could contribute information, whichgenerally supports the chosen members to migrate. Hence, the risks are shared incase migration is unsuccessful. However, a growing literature has observed that
migration, especially the case of irregular migration, can be made out of individual
VOL. 23 NO. 1 2021 jDIGITAL POLICY, REGULATION AND GOVERNANCE jPAGE 15decisions ( Carling and Schewel, 2018 ;Kleist and Thorsen, 2016 ;Schewel, 2020 ). For
instance, some young people migrating irregularly from Africa to Europe do not havethe support of their families (
European Migration Network, 2018 ). The challenge of the
individual migration decision is that the decision-maker often solely bears the risk of
migration. Hence, information and networks become very important for risk
minimization for individual decision-makers. It is therefore plausible that many risk-
averse people may likely not migrate when information is limited. This is in agreement
with the theory of migration under incomplete information, which explains that only the
risk-neutral people can migrate when information is incomplete.
The implication of our results lies in the issue of incomplete information and how it leads to
wrong migration decisions. As a critical migration-mediating factor possessing millions of
bits of contradictory information and rumours, social media may lead to what we call“selective shopping”. We borrow the term from the marketing field where it refers to how a
shopper makes choices among the numerous options available in a supermarket.
Consumers are highly selective and only buy products that meet their personal need.
Integrating this reasoning into our study, we consider that individual decision-makers might
specifically look for information that will confirm what they want to hear/read about
migration, e.g. opportunities in destination countries while paying less attention to the risks
in transit. Hence, they may likely initiate discussions about opportunities of migrants in
destination countries with people in the business of brokering migration. Social media give
them a perfect means to selectively shop for the kind of migration information they want.However, this may lead to incomplete information as we saw in the analysis, where the state
of information is skewed to that of a destination rather than the risk in transit. The brokers
and migrant networks have the power to frame migration stories in such a way that benefits
them. For instance, the brokers may lie about the labour conditions to obtain money and
trust from the client (prospective migrant), and the migrant networks may lie to project a
“success image”.
Cattaneo (2007) argued that when there is imperfect information about
labour conditions in destination countries, there would be possibilities of negative selection.
This means that when the social media and migrant networks fail to provide accurate
information about the actual happenings in destination countries or focus mostly on theopportunities than the risk, this might lead to higher migration aspiration and a likelihood for
irregular migration among those with who cannot afford to migrate through legitimate routes.
This group may likely activate ties with smugglers that enable them to overcome structural
forces like visa and migrate perhaps irregularly (
Liu, 2013 ).Mbaye (2014) gave an
elaborated case description of how this occurs for Senegalese irregular migrants moving to
Spain.
7. Conclusion
This study aims to investigate the connectivity between social media use, access to themigrant network, the states of information received by a person and the migration intention.
It is a departure from the traditional explanation of migration decisions which is based on
rational choices under complete information. We collected data from individuals living in
Nigeria through a combination of an internet-based and paper-based survey. We analysed
the data using a GSEM, which is novel for this kind of research. The major takeaways from
the study are:
/H17039Social media and migrant networks play a mediating role in migration decision making
by providing information, reducing the transaction cost and facilitating migration more
easily. This corroborates with earlier findings ( Dekker et al. , 2018 ;Mu¨nz, 2018 ).
/H17039The constraint to the use of social media for migration purposes can be overcome by
having high capabilities like high income, education, social status, living in urban areas
and having positive predisposition about social media.
PAGE 16jDIGITAL POLICY, REGULATION AND GOVERNANCE jVOL. 23 NO. 1 2021/H17039The main weakness of social media and migrant networks as migration mediators are
their tendency to aid the spread of incomplete information. They are more likely to
provide information on opportunities abroad than the risk on the transits.
/H17039Information about the risk in transit is associated with high migration intention, but moreinformation about the issues in the destination countries negatively influence migration
decision.
The societal impact of this research is to influence policies for awareness creation on
safe migration. To achieve safe and orderly migration, policymakers must consider
the possibilities of incomplete information coming from social media and migrantnetwork. We recommend that social media should also be used as a platform for
disseminating information that could counter the bias information provided by
traffickers and smugglers. Research has shown that when potential migrants have
proper information before migrating, they tend to make better migration decisions
(
Beam et al. ,2 0 1 6 ). The counter information should be complete, containing
information on what is obtainable in destination countries as well as on the risk. The
counter information should go beyond the traditional migration management
campaigns, which focuses on the dangers of the journey to dissuade potentialmigrant (
Musaro `,2 0 1 9 ). Our findings agree with some research on irregular migration
decisions that shows that irregular migrants are not often dissuaded by this kind of
information ( Bah and Batista, 2018 ;Mbaye, 2014 ). Most irregular migrants already
know that they could die in the road but decide to migrate anyways. It is therefore vital
that complete information including the actual happenings on destination countriesare properly disseminated for potential migrants before departure. Policymakers need
to pay attention to this when designing an awareness campaign using social media.
Finally, we consider some of the study limitations as opportunities for future research. One
of the limitations of the study is sampling and sample size. We have drawn our data using asnowball sampling procedure and collected data from both internet-based and paper-
based surveys. Although this method provides an easy way to quickly test our hypotheses,
we understand the risk it poses. For instance, we are careful not to generalize our finding toNigeria as a whole. We maintain that our results reflect mostly young people using social
media and are connected either physically or through social networks. Future research
needs to consider larger sample size and adopt a probability-based sampling procedure.Furthermore, while we mentioned attitude to risk in some parts of this study, our data were
not sufficient to include the risk dimension. We also implore future research to consider
issues concerning risk.
