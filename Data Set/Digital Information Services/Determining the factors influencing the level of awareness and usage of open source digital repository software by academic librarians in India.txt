Abstract
Purpose –The purpose of this paper is to analyze the level of awareness and usage of open source digital
repository software (DRS). The paper also studies the factors, which in ﬂuence the level of awareness and
usage of different open source DRS by academic librarians in India.
Design/methodology/approach –The study administered an online questionnaire to academic
librarians in India to know their level of awareness and usage of open source DRS. The questionnaire aimed to
gather the awareness and usage of open source DSR. In total, 374 complete responses were collected from
academic librarians in India and the collected data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Moreover,Fishers ’exact test was used to identify whether factors i.e. quali ﬁcation and participation in workshop/
seminar in ﬂuence the level of awareness and usage of open source DRS.
Findings –The results of the study reveal that the level of awareness and usage of open source DRS,
namely, DSpace (Mean = 2.92, SD = 0.906) and Greenstone digital library software (GSDL) (Mean = 2.18,SD = 0.699) are high amongst the academic librarians in India. In total, 33.4%, 11.5% of the participants are
using DSpace and GSDL, respectively, on regular basis. Fishers ’exact test shows that factor(s) i.e.
qualiﬁcations and participation in workshop/seminar affect the level of awareness and usage of open source
DRS. The results show that there exits strong relation between participation in workshop/seminar andawareness and usage of DSpace (Fishers ’exact test = 13.473, p<0.05).
Originality/value –This paper is the new type of study exploring level of awareness and usage of open
source DRS by academic librarians in India. It identi ﬁes the factors that affect the awareness and usage of
open source DRS. It is the ﬁrst study to analyze the statistical signi ﬁcance between Indian librarians ’
participation in workshop/seminar and their level of awareness and usage of different open source DRS.

https://www.emerald.com/insight/2059-5816.htmaccess and interact with information. Corollary, the concept of extended libraries that
transcends physical boundaries has come up. Digital library has unleashed immensepotential to empower the users, as well as the librarians to conceive, assemble, build anddisseminate new knowledge and information collections
(Bainbridge et al. ,2 0 0 3 ). In the
digital library landscape, DSpace, Flexible Extensible Digital Object RepositoryArchitecture (Fedora), EPrints and Greenstone, DiVA, Bepress and ContentTool aredominant digital repository software (DRS) for building a digital library or institutionalrepository (IR) (ROAR, 2020 ;Caplan, 2008 ). Most of the software are freely available for
downloading, but the institute has to bear the cost of implementing, customizing anduploading content into the IR, albeit, policy document, technical paper and documentationsare available to implement it in the institute.
Of late, it has been observed that libraries all over the world, including the libraries in
India have adopted and used open source software (OSS) in some parts of library functions,namely, library automation, IR and library website. Prior research suggests that adoptionand use of OSS in libraries depends on the level of awareness by the academic librarians
(Kampa, 2018 ). Plausibly, librarians are more likely to adopt and use OSS in libraries, if their
level of awareness is higher. In view of this, the present study explores the level ofawareness and usage of open source DRS by academic librarians in India. Further, it tries toexplore whether factors such as quali ﬁcation of academic librarians and participation in
workshop/seminar in ﬂuence the level of awareness and usage of different open source DRS.
2. Literature review
The OSS movement has produced huge numbers of expensive and scalable software; and
also raised awareness among the public on the important issues such as open access, openeducation and open content. Digital libraries, open access and OSS are the consequence ofthe “open models of exchange ”and “open innovation ”that help societies grow up and thrive
(Krishnamurthy, 1995 ). There exits signi ﬁcant similarities in philosophies and practices of
OSS community and librarianship; and both of them advocate freedom of use and freeaccess to information ( Morgan, 2004 ;Eyler, 2003 ). OSS offers a bouquet of applications for
libraries and information centres. Because of its intrinsic and economic bene ﬁts, it is
advocated to adopt and use OSS in libraries (Kampa and Kaushik, 2019 ).
With the adoption of OSS in the library, most of the requirements of the library in the
areas of library automation, digital repository and library website can be accommodatedand a huge amount of money could be saved, which could be used for the development ofbetter library systems and services (
Poulter, 2010 ). Due to stiff budget cut in the library,
libraries all over the world are considering for alternatives to commercial software.Consequently, the adoption and usage of OSS in libraries has witnessed a phenomenalincrease ( Payne and Singh, 2010 ). In the area of DRS, open source DRS has considered as an
alternative to commercial DRS. Out of 31 open source DRS available ( Foss4lib, n.d. ), DSpace,
Greenstone, EPrints and Fedora are commonly used and popular open source DRS (Jose,
2007;Hanumappa et al., 2014 ).
Many research studies were carried out on the adoption and use of open source DRS,
which is evident from Table 1. Goh et al. (2003) in their study prepared a checklist to
evaluate four popular open source DRS, namely, CDSware, EPrints, Fedora and Greenstone;and found that Greenstone was the best performing DRS, followed by CDSware, Fedora andEPrints. It is suggested in their paper that a checklist can be used to evaluate softwarewhether that ﬁts into the requirements of their institutions as each software has individual
strengths and weaknesses.DLPSutradhar (2006) described how to design and develop an IR using open source DRS
DSpace; and offers practical guidance to implement IR in universities/institutions. Heviewed that setting up an IR is very easy, but the maintenance of the repository is verycomplicated. Hazarika et al.( 2 0 2 0 ) described in their paper the development of IR using OSS
DSpace for preservation, storing and retrieving of medical images. Ahammad (2019)
described the adoption of DSpace at the Library of Independent University, Bangladesh vis-
à-vis the promotion of open education resources. He viewed that open source DRS has an
important role in promoting open educational resources.
Gkoumas and Lazarinis (2015) evaluated the 13 open source DRS that support the
content of various media forms. It is found in their study that open source DRS offers manyadvanced operations, as well as support various metadata and interoperability protocols
embedded with user-friendly interfaces. Rathee et al. (2020) developed a “multiple-criteria
decision analysis cause and effect factor model ”for the implementation of Greenstone digital
library software (GSDL) in the library. The ﬁndings of the study revealed that user-friendly
interface and usability, information search and retrieval, including authentication andauthorization are the primary factors that must be considered if GSDL is to be implemented
in the library successfully.
In addition to research studies on adoption and use of open source DRS, considerable
research were also undertaken to explore the acceptance and factors that predict thebehavioural intention to use the digital library.
Abdul Rahman and Mohezar (2020) adopted the
semi-structured interviews and explored the f actors that affect the continued use of digital
libraries in a military-context in Malaysia. It is found in their study that “perceived quality
factors; perceived satisfaction and perceived u sefulness, perceived instrumental support and
perceived ease of use ”are different dimensions that affect the continued usage of digital
libraries. Shivdas et al. (2020) critically examined the factors that affected the acceptance and
adoption of digital library system using uni ﬁed theory of acceptance and use of technology
Model-2 (UTAUT2) and information systems su ccess model (ISSM). The study revealed that
performance expectancy, facilitating conditions and habit affected the intention of using the
digital library. Abdul Rahman et al. (2020) examined the critical success factors of the
continued usage of the digital library. The ﬁndings of the study showed that digital library
environment and communication support, bene ﬁts and satisfaction of the users are predictors
of ensuring the continued usage of digital library in military-context. By applying the ISSM
and UTAUT 2 framework, Moorthy et al. (2019) investigated the factors that affect the
behavioural intention to use digital library b y the undergraduates of private universities in
Malaysia. The study revealed that performance expectancy, social in ﬂuence, facilitating
conditions, hedonic motivation, habit and information quality signi ﬁcantly affected the
behavioural intention to adopt a digital library. Alzahrani et al. (2019) in their study used
Delone and McLean ’s information system success model to explore the determinants of the
actual use of a digital library. The study reveale d that system quality, information quality and
service quality had a signi ﬁcant relation with behavioural intention to use digital library.
Tsakona and Papatheodorou (2008) e v a l u a t e do p e na c c e s sd i g i t a l repositories to explore their
usefulness and usability. It is found that useful ness, usability and functionality open access
digital repository affect user interaction and sa tisfaction. The awareness and knowledge of ICT
tools and services are anticident of its adoption and use in the library. Okoroma (2018) studied
the level of awareness, knowledge and attitude of lecturers towards institutional repositories inuniversity libraries in Nigeria. The study showed that the level of awareness and knowledge onthe aims and objectives of IR by the lecturers was very low. As a result, they have shownhardly any interest in submitting their work in IR. He opined that awareness and knowledge ofOpen source
digital
repositorybeneﬁts of IRs coupled with incentives for contribut ors would yield positive attitudinal change
of lecturers towards IRs.
Kampa (2018) studied the Indian library and information science professionals ’level of
awareness and use of open source integrated library system (ILS). The ﬁndings of the study
revealed that quali ﬁcations, experience of using open source ILS and participation in the
mailing list, particularly, OSS affect the level of awareness and use of different open source
ILSs.
3. Objectives
The main objective of the present study is to explore the level of awareness and usage of
open source DRS. The present study attempts to ascertain the following objectives:
/C15To know the level of awareness and usage of open source DRS by academic
librarians in India.
/C15To know whether factors such as quali ﬁcation and participations in workshop/
seminar/conference affect their level of awareness and usage of open source DRS.
4. Research questions
The present study formulates the following research questions based on the objectives of the
study:
RQ1. What is the level of awareness and usage of open source DRS by academic
librarians in India?
RQ2. Does the quali ﬁcation affect the level of awareness and usage of open source DRS?
RQ3. Does participation in workshop/seminar/conference affect the level of awareness
and usage of open source DRS?
5. Methodology
A quantitative method was used in the present study. To achieve the research objectives, a
structured questionnaire was administered to academic librarians in India. Instrument was
posted in various library mailing lists, email groups and forums. The instrument had three
sections (A, B and C). Section A had ﬁve questions on name, gender, name of the institution,
designation and experience. Section B consisted of questions relating to awareness and usage
of OSS and participation in workshop/seminar/ conference. Section C consisted of questions
pertaining to awareness and usage of open sou rce DRS, namely, DSpace, Fedora, GSDL and
EPrints; and response to questions we re recorded in four-point scale as “Never heard of it = 1 ”,
“I am aware but never used it = 2 ”,“Use it only sometimes = 3 ”,“Use it on regular basis = 4 ”.
Of 438 responses received, 374 responses were fo und to be complete in all aspects for statistical
analysis. The collected data were analyzed by descriptive statistics. In addition to descriptive
statistics, a statistical signi ﬁcance test called Fishers ’exact test was used to analyze the
relationship between educational quali ﬁcations and awareness and usage; and between
participation in workshop/seminar and awareness and usage of open source DRS.
6. Selection of open source digital repository software
The present study selected the mostly used open source DRS, namely, DSpace, GSDL,
EPrints and Fedora. Unlike open source ILS, development of the most of digital repository
happened in academic settings, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Hewlett-DLPTable 1.

6.1 Dspace
Developed collaboratively by MIT Libraries, USA and HP, DSpace is an open source DRS
for preserving, indexing and disseminating the research output of an institution in electronicformat. First released in November 2002 under BSD open source license, it is mostly used byresearch libraries and libraries of higher institutions as an IR for whom it was initiallydeveloped. Albeit, many government, private institutions and commercial companies areadopting it to host and manage their subject-based, data set and media-based repositories
(DSpace. 2020 ). The core value of DSpace is that the content and information system it deals
with will live longer than the system itself.
DSpace, a conglomeration of Java web applications and utility programmes, was
developed to be open source in such a way that institutions/organizations with bare minimalresources could run it. It uses PostgreSQL as its default database, but Oracle can also beused for managing its metadata. DSpace is compliant with standards and protocols i.e. openarchives initiative (OAI)-PMH, OAI-ORE, SWORD, WebDAV, OpenSearch, OpenURL, RSS,ATOM for access, ingest and export
(Smith et al.,2 0 0 3 ;DSpace. 2020 ). Unlike Greenstone,
DSpace is not simple to install as it uses many OSS having multiple license agreements. Itsupports con ﬁgurable work ﬂow process and submission policy, including built-in
authorization of system to improve the ﬂexibility and security of the system (Han, 2004 ).
6.2 Greenstone digital library software
Developed by the New Zealand Digital Library Project in the Computer Science Department
at the University of Waikato, New Zealand in collaboration with United NationsEducational, Scienti ﬁc and Cultural Organization and Human Info NGO, GSDL is a suite of
software for building and distributing digital library collections on the internet or compactdisc read-only memory. First released in 2000 under GNU General Public License, GSDL isopen source multi-lingual software. GSDL uses C þþ, Java and Perl programming
languages and it can run on cross platforms i.e. Windows, UNIX/Linux, Solaris and MACOS.
With its multiple plugins embedded to GSDL, it automatically converts ﬁles in common
formats, namely, MS Word, portable document format and PostScript to their correspondinghypertext markup language documents and at the same time, it keeps the ﬁles in original
formats without any change. It is compatible with many standards i.e. OAI-PMH 2.0, SearchRetrieval via uniform resource locator, Z39.50 and machine-readable cataloging (MARC)record import, which make GSDL an appropriate option for integrating it with an ILS forfull-text indexing and searching. It supports Dublin Core Metadata, including Greenstones ’
metadata schema. GSDL has a robust search module that supports wildcard, Boolean logicsand full-text search
(Greenstone Digital Library Software, 2020 ;Witten et al.,2 0 0 1 ).
GSDL has a built-in Unicode support for both multiple language collection and user
interface. It is fairly matured OSS for building a digital library but, it lacks a built-inworkﬂow process and users will unable to customize it to meet their work ﬂow needs and
requirements
(Han, 2004 ).Open source
digital
repository6.3 Fedora
Fedora, developed jointly by the University of Virginia and Cornell University, USA is a
digital asset management. For building a digital object repository, the Andrew W. Millon
Foundation funded the Fedora project based on the research paper “Fedora ”. Having a
modular architecture, Fedora is designed on the principle of interoperability and
extensibility, which is the best suited for building web-based institutional repositories,
digital archives and information systems. Originally ﬁrst released in May 2003 under
Apache license 2.0, Fedora supports standards i.e. Dublin Core, OAI-PMH and MARC
except Z39.50. The search engine of Fedora supports wildcard, Boolean logics, but it does
not support full text search. DuraSpace supports Fedora Project (Fedora, 2020 ;Han, 2004 ).
6.4 EPrints
EPrints, developed at the University of Southampton, England in 2000, is the world leading
open source digital repository platform compliant with the OAI protocol for metadata
harvesting. Embedded with all the features available in document management systems,
EPrints is basically used for building IR and scienti ﬁc journal. It is a powerful and
economical solution for disseminating scholarly writings with the world (Sponsler and Van
de Velde, 2001 ). The submission process of EPrints, which is intuitive, requires minimum
efforts for the author to upload/manage a document. However, an institutional commitment
and dedication is required for preserving the document for long-term (Eprint, 2020 ).
7. Results
7.1 Demographic characteristics of the participants
Table 3 reveals that 374 academic librarians participated in the survey. Out of 374
participants, 79.7% ( n= 298) were male and 20.3% ( n= 76) were female. All the participants
had i.e. Master in Library and Information Science (MLIS) or MPhil or PhD degree in libraryand information science. In total, 55.1% ( n= 206) of the participants had MLIS degree, 23%
and 21.9% of them had PhD degree MPhil degree, respectively.
Of the participants, 25.7%, 28.3%, 19% and 27% had professional experience of 1 –

workshop/seminar, 143 (55.6%) participants reported to have participated for learning the
hands-on training on OSS available for library:
RQ1. What is the level of awareness and usage of open source DRS by academic
librarians in India?
To analyze the level of awareness and usage of open source DRS, namely, DSpace, GSDL,
EPrints and Fedora by the academic librarians, descriptive statistics was used, and results
show that DSpace is the most used open source DRS by the academic librarians in India(Mean = 2.92, SD = 0.906). It is found that 33.4% of the participants are using DSpace
regularly, which reveals that it is the most popular DRS. In total, 28.6% of the participants
reported that they have used it only for sometimes; whereas 34.2% of the participantsinformed that they are aware of it, but they never used and only 3.7% of them said that theynever heard of it (
Table 3 ). Plausibly, the high usage of DSpace might be attributed to
numerous workshop/training are being organized on it.
In case of awareness and usage of GSDL, the results reveal that it is the widely used open
source DRS (Mean = 2.18, SD = 0.699) next to DSpace. In total, 11.5% of the participants are
using it regularly, 31.3% have used it sometimes, 51.6% are aware of it, but never used it;
and surprisingly 5.6% of them never heard of it ( Table 3 ). EPrints is another scalable and
most popular open source DRS worldwide, however, only 5.3%, 18.7% of participants
reported that they are using it regularly and have used it sometimes, respectively (Mean =
1.95, SD = 0.565). In total, 64.2% of the respondents reported that they are aware of it, butnever used it.
A minuscule percentage (1.6%) of the participants said that they are using Fedora
regularly and only 8.8% of them have used it sometimes. In total, 72.7% are aware of it, but
never used it ( Table 4 ):
RQ2. Does the quali ﬁcation affect the level of awareness and usage of open source DRS?
In total, 43% of the PhD holder compared to 26.8% of MPhil holder and 32% of MLIS degree
holder use DSpace regularly. In total, 24.4%, 29.3% and 30.1% of participants holding PhD,
MPhil and MLIS degree have used DSpace only for sometimes. In total, 32.6% of the
participants holding PhD degree compared to 37.8% of participants holding MPhil and33.5% of participants holding MLIS degree are aware of DSpace, but they never used it.
Table 5 displays responses to awareness and usage of DSpace by quali ﬁcation. Fishers ’
exact test reveals there is no signi ﬁcant relationship between the highest quali ﬁcation
obtained by academic librarians and their awareness and usage of DSpace ( p>0.05). That

MLIS is equal.
In case of awareness and usage of EPrints, 1.2% of participants holding PhD degree
compared to 4.9% of participants holding MPhil degree and 7.3% of participants holdingMLIS degree use it regularly. When participants were asked whether they have ever used it,38.4% of participants holding PhD degree have used it sometimes compared to 6.1% of theparticipants holding MPhil and 15.5% of participants holding MLIS degree. In total, 55.8%of participants having PhD degree compared to 74.4% and 63.6% of participants holdingMPhil and MLIS degree, respectively, are aware of EPrints, but never used it.
Fishers ’exact test reveals there is a strong statistical association between educational
qualiﬁcations and level of awareness and usage of EPrints by academic librarians in India
p<0.001). That means the level of awareness and usage of Eprints by the participants
holding PhD, MPhil and MLIS is not equal.
In total, 11.6% of the participants holding PhD degree compared to 8.5% of participants
holding MPhil and 12.6% of participants holding MLIS degree use GSDL regularly. In total,40.7% of the PhD participants compared to 20.7% of participants holding MPhil and 31.6%of MLIS respondents have used it for sometimes. In total, 46.5%, 62.2% and 49.5% of theparticipants holding PhD, MPhil and MLIS degree, respectively, said that they are aware ofGSDL, but they never used it. In total, 1.2%, 8.5% and 6.3% of participants holding PhD,MPhil and MLIS degree, respectively, said that they have never heard of GSDL.
Fishers ’exact test reveals there is a statistically signi ﬁcant relationship between highest
qualiﬁcation of academic librarians and awareness and usage of GSDL, that means
participants holding PhD, MPhil and MLIS degree does not have equal level of awareness
and usage of GSDL ( p<0.05) (

MLIS degree use it regularly. When participants were asked whether they have ever used it,
8.1% of participants holding PhD degree reported that they have used it for sometimes
compared to 11.0% of the participants holding MPhil and 8.3% of participants holdingMLIS degree. In total, 84.9% of participants having PhD degree compared to 68.3% and
69.4% of participants holding MPhil and MLIS degree, respectively, are aware of Fedora,
but never used it. In total, 3.5%, 19.5% and 21.4% of participants holding PhD, MPhil and
MLIS, respectively, reported that they have not heard of Fedora.
Fishers ’exact test reveals that there is strong statistical association between educational
background and awareness and usage of Fedora by academic librarians in India, that is, the
level of awareness and usage of Fedora by academic librarians holding PhD, MPhil and
MLIS is not equal ( p<0.05) (
Table 5 ):
RQ3. Does the participation in workshop/seminar affect level of awareness and usage of
open source DRS.
To examine the relationship between the academic librarians ’participation in workshop/
seminar on OSS and their level of awareness and usage of open source DRS, Fishers ’exact
test was used. It is found that 53.1% of survey participants, who have attended in different
workshop/seminar on OSS, are using DSpace on regular basis compared to 25.2% ofparticipants had used it sometime, 20.3% of them reported that they are aware, but never
used it and only 1.4% of the participants reported that they have not heard of it. Fishers ’
exact test reveals that there is a strong relationship between participation of academic
librarians in workshop/seminar and their level of awareness and usage of DSpace ( p<0.05)
(
Table 6 ).
In case of EPrints, 8.4% of participants, who have participated in the workshop, are
using it on regular basis, whereas 25.9% of them had used it sometime and 59.4% are aware
of it, but never used it. Fishers ’exact test ( p>0.05) demonstrates that there is no
relationship between participation of academic librarians in workshop/seminar and theirawareness and usage of EPrints (
Table 6 ).
When analyzing the relationship between participation in workshop/seminar and
awareness and usage of GSDL, it is found that 18.2% of the participants are using it
regularly, whereas 37.8% of the participants reported to have used it sometime and 39.9% ofparticipants are aware of it, but never used it. Fishers ’exact test reveals that there is no
relationship between participation in workshop/seminar and level of awareness and usage
of GSDL, but it is remarkable as the p-value is 0.074.
In case Fedora, 2.8% of respondents, who have participated in workshop/seminar, are
using it regularly, whereas 14% of them have used it sometime, 70.6% of them are aware,
but never used it and 12.6% of them have never heard of it. Fishers ’exact test ( p>0.05)
reveals that the relationship between participation in workshop/seminar and level of
awareness and usage of Fedora is not signi ﬁcant.
8. Discussion
The present study has examined the level of awareness and usage of open source DRS,
including investigating the relationships between quali ﬁcations and participation in
workshop/seminar and awareness and usage of open source DRS. The results shows that
the level of awareness and usage of open source DRS, namely, DSpace (Mean = 2.92, SD =
0.906) and GSDL (Mean = 2.18, SD = 0.699) are high among the academic librarians in India.
In total, 33.4% and 11.5% of the participants are using regularly DSpace and GSDL,Open source
digital
repositoryrespectively ( RQ1). The high level of awareness and usage of DSpace and GSDL might be
attributed to the availability of documentations, scalability of the software and variousfeatures, including numerous workshops/seminars, which are being organized on both thesoftware.
The results show that educational quali ﬁcations of academic librarians has strong
relationship with the level of awareness and usage of open source DRS in case of EPrints,GSDL and Fedora ( RQ2,p<0.05); that means academic librarians do not have equal level of
awareness and usage of these DRS.
There is no gainsaying the fact that participation in workshop/seminar helps hone up
skills and awareness on products and services. Corollary, it increases the level of awareness
and usage of a products and services. Plausibly, it can be hypothesized that participation inworkshop/seminar is an antecedent of the level of awareness and usage of open source DRS.Theﬁndings reveal that there exits a signi ﬁcant relationship between participation of
academic librarians in workshop/seminar and their awareness and usage of DSpace ( RQ3,
p<0.05). It is found that more than 50 percentage (53.1%) of the participants, who have
participated in different workshops/seminars, are using DSpace on regular basis. In case of
DSpace, the level of awareness and usage is higher than other DRS because workshop/seminar on DSpace have been organized more frequently in India than in other open sourceDRS.
9. Conclusions
Digital repository, which espouses the promotion of ef ﬁcient delivery of information, has
witnessed a spiralling adoption and use in the academic institutions since the past decade.Theﬁndings of the present study show that the level of awareness and usage of open sourceTable 6.

the mostly used open source DRS followed by GSDL. Academic quali ﬁcations and
participation in workshop/seminar on different OSS are the two determining factors thatstrongly in ﬂuence the level of awareness and usage of open source DRS by academic
librarians in India. This research has various implications at different level. The higher
educational institutions and other professional bodies should promote OSS and organize
workshop and training programme on OSS, thereby increasing the level of awareness andusage of OSS. Course module on different OSS can be incorporated in syllabus of MLIS,which could enhance the awareness level of budding academic librarians towards OSS,including open source DRS. Consequently, it will increase the adoption and usage of OSS.
The study also presents many research implications. Firstly, this study responds to the
call for a research study on awareness and use of digital repository
(Kampa, 2018 ). Secondly,
it could inform the researchers, who are willing to conduct study, the level of awareness andusage of open source digital library by developed and developing countries. Thirdly, thisresearch suggests the need to study whether open source digital repository supports open
data and open educational resources.
