Abstract: With the widespread use of three-dimensional (3D) geographic information technologies,
studies for 3D digital representation of property units in cadasters have increased in recent years.
In Turkey, a project named 3D City Models and Cadasters was initiated by the General Directorate of
Land Registries and Cadasters in 2018. With this project, which is planned to last four years, it aims to
create 3D models of individual units (apartments) in buildings and provide visual representations of
these individual units with legal information. Transition from the current 2D representation towards
a 3D digital cadaster requires not only replacing analog drawings with 3D models but also examining
the workﬂow for forming the property units. In this study, the process of registration of property
rights for individual units is examined and possibilities and challenges for successful completion of
the 3D cadaster project are evaluated from a legal, an organizational, and a technical point of view.
Government plays a lead role by adopting the digital transformation as a state policy. However,
new regulations and organizational settings may have to be introduced. Modeling and visualization
alternatives for 3D data should be studied further.

1. Introduction
Reports published by organizations such as the International Federation of Surveyors (FIG)
and the United Nations (UN) revealed that existing cadastral systems have shown limitations in the
management of complex rights, restrictions, and responsibilities related to the land [ 1,2]. Ideally,
it is expected that the future, modern cadastral systems will show the complete legal situation of
land, including public rights and restrictions [ 3]. A need especially in cadastral systems in urban
areas has emerged to register and represent the structures or property units located on top of each
other in space rather than being restricted to a single plane. To address this need, various research
activities have been conducted related to three-dimensional (3D) cadasters during the last two decades.
The ﬁrst FIG workshop on 3D cadasters in 2001 was the starting point for the 3D cadaster research.
In the past 20 years, many meetings, studies, and pilot projects have been carried out related to legal,
organizational, and technical aspects of 3D cadaster [4–6].
Buildings and individual units are the main objects with 3D characteristics in cadastral systems.
Individual units are usually recorded separately from base parcels. In the current situation, individual
units are not visible on the cadastral map, with only the outline of the building in relation to the ground
being visible [ 7]. However, some countries and some municipalities have developed solutions for 3D
volumetric registration /representation of individual units. The most common approach adopted for
solutions at the beginning was that the drawings of the building showing the individual units (analog

or digital) were made accessible. But these drawings were not integrated with the spatial part of the
cadastral database [ 8,9]. However, with the increasing use of 3D geographic information technologies,
use of spatial data models for a 3D digital representation of individual units has become widespread in
recent years [10–19].
Several studies with di erent approaches have been conducted related to individual units in
recent years. For example, Thompson, et al. [ 20] oers use of XML (Extensible Markup Language)
based survey plans to integrate individual units with cadastral data while Atazadeh et al. [ 21] models
property boundaries of individual units within the BIM (Building Information Modeling) environment.
Cemellini et al. [ 22] developed a LADM (Land Administration Domain Model) based prototype for 3D
representing of individual units. Atazadeh et al. [ 23] compared di erent 3D spatial data models to
provide visual representation of individual units. Also, Biljecki et al. [ 24], studied the use of GML-based
city models in various spatial analyses related to individual units.
Since the early 2000s, projects have been started by the General Directorate of Land Registries
and Cadasters (GDLRC) with di erent aims such as updating cadastral data, producing cadastral
data themes for national data infrastructure, and establishing land information systems [ 25]. GDLRC
announced a new project named 3D City Models and Cadasters in 2018. The project was ﬁrst started
in the Turkish capital Ankara and was planned to last four years for the whole country. The main aim
of the project is to produce 3D models of buildings and individual units and relate these models to
legal information (Figure 1). At an announcement about the ongoing project made by GDLRC in 2019,
it was stated that production of detailed 3D models and sample title deeds had been started, and that
studies for integration of the models with the GDLRC information system would continue [26].
In addition to GDLRC, the General Directorate of Geographic Information Systems (GDGIS)
completed the project entitled “Production of 3D Building and City Topography Data Sets in 2019”.
With this project, after the data acquisition studies carried out by photogrammetric survey, the 3D
vector data (in CityGML) of buildings was used in analyses such as of solar irradiation and volumetric
structure density in urban areas [27].

of national spatial data infrastructure and published by GDGIS. Shortly after the presidential decree
was published, the National Smart Cities Strategy and Action Plan covering the period between 2020Land 2020 ,9, 179 3 of 17
and 2023 was put into force by publication in the o cial gazette on December 24, in 2019. Activities in
the action plan include developing a reference model for smart cities and integrating the model with
the national spatial data infrastructure [ 30]. All these developments show that by being integrated
with other data sets, the cadastral data will be used more frequently in the future for management and
planning of cities besides providing legal information.
Transition from current 2D representation towards a 3D digital cadaster requires not only replacing
analog drawings with 3D models but also examining the workﬂow for deﬁning the property units.
In this study, the registration process of property rights for individual units is examined, and possibilities
and needs for successful completion of the 3D cadaster project are evaluated from legal, organizational,
and technical points of view. Section 2 describes the process for forming property rights of individual
units in Turkey. Section 3 presents the phases of the 3D cadaster project initiated by GDLRC. The 3D
cadaster project is evaluated in Section 4. Finally, the paper ends with conclusions in Section 5.
2. Current Cadastral Registration of Individual Units in T urkey
The most typical cadastral objects that can be registered separately from the parcels are buildings
or individual units. There are approximately 20.9 million individual units in Turkey. Registration of
the individual units is subject to the Condominium Law and the rights on the individual units are
recorded in a condominium book. In Turkey, a dual model has been adopted to establish the property
rights of individual units. In this model, every individual unit owner has the full property rights for a
part of the building (the individual unit) while the communal areas (such as staircases and elevators)
of the building are held as co-property. After the construction is completed, it is obligatory to survey
the boundaries of the building on the ground and draw the boundaries on a cadastral map in order to
prepare the condominium title for each individual unit. A condominium title is an o cial document
showing property rights of the individual units in a building.
Registration of the independent units is carried out by GDLRC. However, ﬁrstly, an application
for construction permission (CP) must be submitted to the municipality. At this stage, documents
(title deed, architectural project, installation projects, etc.) are prepared according to the Zoning Law
and related regulations are delivered to the municipality for checking. According to the Zoning Law,
the municipality must complete the application within 30 days. If a deﬁciency is detected, the applicant
is given 15 days to correct the deﬁciencies. After the construction is completed, application for
occupancy permission (OP) must be submitted to the municipality. The OP is the document given
for all the independent units within the main building and shows that the independent units are
built in accordance with the CP . In Turkey, due to the country’s growing population, demand for new
construction is high. The chart in Figure 2 shows the numbers of CP and OP for last ten years in
Turkey. For the last decade, the total number of CP and OP were 1190350 and 1082388, respectively.
Therefore, the average of the last ten years for CP and OP were 119035 and 108239, respectively [ 31].
The reason why the total CP number is larger than the total OP number is the structures that have not
been completed yet. This is also true for most of the years in Figure 2. In the last two years, however,
the number of new construction projects is less than the number of buildings that have received a
residence permit.
After obtaining the CP , the registration phase of the individual units begins. As in many countries,
in Turkey, the Civil Law is the main legal basis for deﬁning and registering property boundaries.
According to article 718 of the Turkish Civil Law, property involving land reaches from the middle
of the earth up to the sky as far as the owner has possible interest. In addition, constructions ﬁxed
to the land are part of the property. According to Article 998 of the Turkish Civil Law, individual
units of the building are registered in the land registry (organizational part of the GDLRC responsible
for registration of real estates). Both land registration and cadastral mapping are maintained by one
organization (GDLRC).The registration process of individual units begins with changing the type of
the base parcel (parcel with the building erected on it) in the land registry records. To do this, after
the boundaries of the building are surveyed by a licensed surveyor, the type of the parcel in the landLand 2020 ,9, 179 4 of 17
registry records is updated as ‘parcel with building’. At the same time, boundaries are inserted into the
spatial cadastral database. Finally, by using the OP and architectural project documentation, which are
sent to the land registry by the municipality, property rights for each individual unit are established
according to the Condominium Law. Figure 3 shows the process for forming the property rights of
individual units in Turkey.

records. To do this, after the boundaries of the building are surveyed by a licensed surveyor, the 
type of the parcel in the land registry records is updated as ‘parcel with buil ding’. At the same time, 
boundaries are inserted into the sp atial cadastral database. Finally, by using the OP and architectural 
project documentation, which are sent to the land registry by the municipality, property rights for 
each individual unit are established according to the Condominium Law. Figure 3 shows the process for forming the property rights of individual units in Turkey.

Therefore, the building and the blocks consisting of buildings are modeled as a spatial unit with Building (Bina) and BuildingBlock (BinaBlok) classes. Common parts of the building and the 
individual units are modeled by representing them  using the IndividualUnit (BagimsizBolum) class.

In Turkey, information about buildings and parcels is recorded separately. However, when property
rights of an individual unit are established, the parcel and individual unit can be related using a
parcel id. In addition, the address of the building is independent of the parcel. Therefore, the detailed
relationships of the building data theme to Cadaster and the address data themes are deﬁned in the
model including building features.
Detail types deﬁned for the building data theme are SummaryConstruction (OzetYapi),
SummaryBuilding (OzetBina), OtherConstruction (DigerYapi), Building (Bina), BuildingBlock
(BinaBlok) and BuildingIndividualUnit (BinaBagımsızBolum). SummaryConstruction is a detail
type that contains basic attributes of a construction that needs to be deﬁned. The versionStartDate
(versiyonBaslangicTarihi) and versionFinaleDate (versiyonBitisTarihi) attributes are used for modeling
temporal changes. Also, constructionDate (insaatTarihi), constructionName (yapiAdi) and
constructionSituation (yapiDurumu) are deﬁned as primary attributes.
The SummaryBuilding includes other attributes that need to be deﬁned for the building.
OtherConstruction is used to deﬁne other constructions such as bridges between buildings and
swimming pools. Both the OtherConstruction and SummaryBuilding are represented in the
SummaryConstruction class by the generalization relationship. The Building refers to building
data type as deﬁned in the Address data theme. BuildingBlock covers other subdivisions of the
building that are not deﬁned in other classes. BuildingIndividualUnit deﬁnes all or part of the building
(apartment, cellar, garage, etc.) independently. Here, the apartment, cellar, garage, etc. can be

3.2. Data Acquisition
With modern surveying technology, 3D data collection has become easier. In particular,
GNSS-based surveying techniques can provide high accuracy 3D coordinates. Also, both terrestrial
laser-scanning and aerial laser-altimetry (LIDAR) are very e ective in the collection of elevation data
for large regions [ 38]. In addition, unmanned aerial photogrammetry is an important source of 3D
data collection in recent years [ 39]. Traditionally, one of the approaches for constructing 3D models
of buildings is to capture footprints and extrude these footprints to a given height. Although this
approach is very fast and su cient for large regions, the buildings appear as blocks in the model
and detail of roofs cannot be modeled [ 40]. Another common approach is to ﬁt predeﬁned shapes of
buildings to the 3D point clouds. The major disadvantage of the approach, however, is that it is very
time-consuming [ 41]. Furthermore, with the advancement of remote sensing technologies, such as
LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and aerial photogrammetry, it is now possible to automatically
and remotely measure the height of a building, which can be used to obtain a volumetric representation
of a building (3D city model). For applications such as Google Earth and Bing Maps a number of
operational tools have been developed for the automatic reconstruction of 3D city models from aerial
photogrammetry [ 42]. In all approaches, however, individual units cannot be recognized in the 3D
model. In many countries, although property of the individual units is established in a land registry,
spatial information related to individual units can only be indicated in 2D drawings. Therefore, it is
not possible to see the spatial distribution of individual units in a building [43].
Data acquisition for the 3D cadaster project, announced in February 2018 in Turkey, started in
December 2018. The study area for the ﬁrst phase of data acquisition covers 1662 cadaster maps at
a scale of 1 /1000 and 58388 architectural projects. Data acquisition begins with geodetic activities.
These activities include establishment and surveying of ground control points in the ﬁeld. Then images
are collected by aerial photogrammetry and processing of GNSS-IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)
data are carried out. Production of digital terrain /elevation models, point clouds, and orthophotos
is performed in the next step. After producing vector data and 3D models of buildings using
photogrammetric data, 3D models and ﬂoor models of buildings are produced using architectural
project data. 3D models of the buildings in the project area are ﬁrst produced in accordance with the
LOD (Level of Detail)2 deﬁnition speciﬁed in the CityGML v2.0 [ 44] document using photogrammetric
data. In LOD2, buildings are modeled as simple structures containing standard and simpliﬁed roof
structures. Then, by using the architectural projects, the buildings are modeled at the LOD2.3 and
each ﬂoor of the building are deﬁned in an OBJ ﬁle. The OBJ ﬁle is a standard 3D image format that
can be exported and opened by various 3D image editing programs. It contains a three-dimensional
object, which includes 3D coordinates, texture maps, polygonal faces, and other object information [ 45].
LOD2.3 requires explicitly modeled roof overhangs if they are longer than 0.2 m, therefore the roof edge
and the footprints are always at their actual location [ 46]. At next stages, veriﬁcation of geometries is
performed by comparing models from photogrammetry and from architectural projects. In the project,
the veriﬁcation is performed for 3D models of buildings by comparing the building model produced
from photogrammetry to the building model produced from architectural projects. Veriﬁcation criteria
of CityGML are considered. The geometries that are stored in the CityGML format are supposed to
conform to the ISO 19107 deﬁnitions [ 47] for polygons (as GM_Ring and GM_Polygon) and polyhedra
(as GM_Shell and GM_Solid), which should ensure that these form valid 2D and 3D objects. Mainly,
a polygon should be closed and non-self-intersecting. Similarly, a polyhedron should be closed and
non-self-intersecting. The results depend on the data set, but this procedure does manage to repair
many problematic buildings. A tolerance needs to be set to deﬁne which faces are co-planar (set to
0.01 m) [ 48,49]. Texturing of 3D models of buildings is carried out using oblique images. Individual
units are modeled in 3D by using the architectural projects. At the ﬁnal stage, we aimed to associate
these 3D models with legal records in the database of GDLRC.
Images and vector data are geo-referenced and projected as Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
—Datum ITRF96 (International Terrestrial Reference Frame 1996). In 3D modeling of the individualLand 2020 ,9, 179 8 of 17
units, the geometry subject to property rights is taken as the basis of the assessment. In the digitization
of the individual units, the outer boundaries of the individual units in the architectural project is
considered. Interior walls are digitized with the thickness shown in the architectural project without
doors. The outer walls and the windows on the inner walls, if any, are not digitized. Walls of the
individual units in buildings of one story will be extruded by the value given in the architectural
project. The 3D model of the individual units will show the name (living room, kitchen, etc.) and
size (in square meters) of each room. In addition, each segment exceeding 50 cm on the outer walls is
represented in the model. Attributes of 3D models will be prepared in an ADE (Application Domain
Extensions) ﬁle, which is deﬁned as the CityGML extension. In this ﬁle, the coordinates of the ﬂoors,
the name of province /district /neighborhood, parcel /individual unit number, and individual unit area is
included [26].
3.3. 3D Visualization
As mentioned earlier, studies have been carried out to manage and model cadastral data since the
2000s in Turkey. With the LRCIS project, legal information (rights, restrictions, and responsibilities) of
the real estate has been accessible by users such as citizens, municipalities, and some ministries since
the mid-2000s. In addition to legal information, in order to provide spatial information of real estate
to users the Spatial Real Estate System (SRES) project was launched in 2013 by GDLRC. With SRES,
the aim was to disseminate the CAD (Computer-Aided Design) models of parcels (in 2D) with map
services and to provide access for citizens through the e-government portal. As the ﬁrst application
of this project in 2014, the Parcel Query Application (PQA) was opened to public access through the
GDLRC website (Figure 7). It is possible to query a cadastral parcel and to list attributes (area, parcel
number, addresses, etc.) of the queried parcel using PQA. While initially 2.5 million queries were
performed per month using PQA, an average of 3.5 million parcels per day were queried in 2019 [ 50].

building is marked on the satellite image (Figure 8). An average of 3 million e-government users per 
month requested their real estate informatio n (parcel or individual unit) in 2019 [50]. 
While the data acquisition for the 3D cadaste r project continues, GDLRC has announced a 
prototype showing how to visualize the individual units. When this prototype shown in Figure 9 is 
examined, it is seen that 3D building model, floor plan of an individual unit in the building and legal information of the selected individual unit can be visible together. With the 3D cadaster project, the 
existing roof structure will be obtained by photog rammetric survey and transferred to the 3D model 
with LOD2.3 model geometry. While 3D floor mo dels are being developed, plans (building, 
basement, ground and loft), sections and views of architectural projects will be used. In the 3D 
cadaster project, use of CityGML data model at LoD2.3 is preferred for 3D modeling of buildings. 
However, studies in several countries have shown that data models such as IFC [51–53], IndoorGML [54–57], and LandXML [58,59] can be used in 3D modeling of cadastral data. In addition, for web-based visualization of the 3D models, there ar e other alternatives such as Nasa World Wind, 
Cesium JS, Terra Explorer, and Google Earth [60]. On January 24, in 2019, two map services (GDM-Atlas and GDP-Sphere) were opened to user  access by the General Directorate of Mapping 
(GDM) to meet the web based map needs of citizens and institution, to eliminate the dependency on foreign applications, and to contribute to digital transformation. GDLRC is pl anning to visualize the 
cadastral data using the GDM infrastructure in the future. Thus, the aim is to avoid paying fees to 
foreign companies for the visualization of cadastral data and to prevent the collection of personal information through foreign applications. 
4. Evaluation 
In order to realize a 3D cadaster, legal, institutio nal, and technical aspects should be taken into 
account together. If the legal definition of property in 3D is not available, it would be meaningless to 
survey and register the 3D objects. Therefore legal definitions for registration of 3D property units 
are needed first. Organizational as pects are critical to providing a workflow to register the legally 
defined 3D property units. The technical aspect s of 3D cadaster require finding solutions to 
incorporating the information of the 3D objects in the cadastral database. In this section, 3D digital representation of individual units in Turkey is evaluated based on its legal, organizational, and 
technical aspects.

Unlike parcels, information of the individual units can be accessible only by the owner of the
units through the e-government portal. In addition to title deed information of the individual unit,
boundaries of the ground parcel can be visible on a map for the individual unit owner. Also, the building
is marked on the satellite image (Figure 8). An average of 3 million e-government users per month
requested their real estate information (parcel or individual unit) in 2019 [50].

4.1. Legal Aspects 
In Turkey, property rights are guaranteed by the Constitution, and the Civil Law describes 
general boundaries of the rights involving real estate. Although the Civil Law does not limit the 
property of land in the third dimension, use of a parc el can be restricted by other public laws such as 
the Zoning Law, Condominium Law, and Mine Law. The Condominium Law is the legal basis for the registration of individual units in a building. The system adopted for registration of property rights of individual units is advantageous for a 3D  representation, and it is easier to determine the 
property boundaries of the individual units in relation to the parcels. The physical boundaries of the individual units can be used to describe the le gal boundaries. With the 3D cadaster project of 
Turkey, which was started in 2018 for 3D digital representation of individual units, some technical 
works were completed and a prototype was introduc ed. In order to make it possible to use 3D 
digital data in the land registry, arrangements were made in Articles 10, 12, and 14 of the Condominium Law on February 15, 2018. Accordingly, when forming property rights of individual units, architectural projects and documents (occupancy permission and management plan of the building) can be prepared and sent to GDLRC in elec tronic form. However, the term 'electronic' is a 
very general and there is no reference to any specific  data structure/format in  the law. Therefore, an 
amendment to the current Statute for Land Registry Plans could be needed to provide exact 
definition of ‘digital’ files used for the registrati on of individual units. Still, acceptance of the 
electronic/digital information as a part of the legal documentation necessary for registration is an important step towards 3D digital re presentation of individual units.

of the expressions: ‘Kat No’ = ‘Floor number’, ‘Daire No’ = ‘Individual unit Number’, ‘Sonuç’ =

The existence of informal structures should also be taken into account in the 3D digital 
visualization of independent units. Especially in rapidly growing large cities, there are informal structures (building or individual units). That is, they do not obey zoning or building codes and, 
therefore, they do not have occu pancy permission. For example, a four-story building may appear as 
three-story building according to the records in the land registry. In the 3D cadaster project, the whole building is modeled by using photogrammetric data, while individual units are modeled by using their projects stored in the land registry. Ther efore, the last floor of the four-story building and 
the individual units located on this floor cannot  be represented. As a result, a 3D cadastral 
representation does not necessarily reflect the real situation it represents. Since the cadaster is concerned with legal objects, a solution (e.g. zoning amnesty) is needed to ensure representation of these objects in a 3D cadaster. 
Differences between physical and legal objects should be recognized. Boundaries of the legal 
objects (rights) do not necessarily coincide with physi cal objects, therefore it is not the object which is 
registered in cadaster but only the legal space (2D/ 3D) related to the individual unit. Since there is a 
strong relationship between the represented legal object (maintained by the cadaster) and the represented physical object, the physical and legal representations should be updated consistently 
within a given amount of reasonable time when a individual units is updated [9,62]. 
In essence, the 3D cadastral objects are the content and partition of space, and they aim to 
register legal status and property rights associated with land and other real estates or properties. To 
define the 3D cadastral object, represent its 3D space, and associate it with its attributes and rights become the key contents for the 3D cadastral system  [14]. The boundaries of the 3D cadastral space 
not only describe the geometric locations but also car ry legal meanings concerning the legal rights of 
space occupation. 3D cadasters aim to manage the 3D  space of 3D objects by using 3D geometry to

4. Evaluation
In order to realize a 3D cadaster, legal, institutional, and technical aspects should be taken into
account together. If the legal deﬁnition of property in 3D is not available, it would be meaningless to
survey and register the 3D objects. Therefore legal deﬁnitions for registration of 3D property units are
needed ﬁrst. Organizational aspects are critical to providing a workﬂow to register the legally deﬁned
3D property units. The technical aspects of 3D cadaster require ﬁnding solutions to incorporating the
information of the 3D objects in the cadastral database. In this section, 3D digital representation of
individual units in Turkey is evaluated based on its legal, organizational, and technical aspects.
4.1. Legal Aspects
In Turkey, property rights are guaranteed by the Constitution, and the Civil Law describes general
boundaries of the rights involving real estate. Although the Civil Law does not limit the property of
land in the third dimension, use of a parcel can be restricted by other public laws such as the Zoning

of individual units in a building. The system adopted for registration of property rights of individual

the individual units in relation to the parcels. The physical boundaries of the individual units can be
used to describe the legal boundaries. With the 3D cadaster project of Turkey, which was started in 2018

was introduced. In order to make it possible to use 3D digital data in the land registry, arrangements
were made in Articles 10, 12, and 14 of the Condominium Law on February 15, 2018. Accordingly,

structure /format in the law. Therefore, an amendment to the current Statute for Land Registry Plans
could be needed to provide exact deﬁnition of ‘digital’ ﬁles used for the registration of individual units.
Still, acceptance of the electronic /digital information as a part of the legal documentation necessary for
registration is an important step towards 3D digital representation of individual units.
The existence of informal structures should also be taken into account in the 3D digital visualization
of independent units. Especially in rapidly growing large cities, there are informal structures (building
or individual units). That is, they do not obey zoning or building codes and, therefore, they do not
have occupancy permission. For example, a four-story building may appear as three-story building
according to the records in the land registry. In the 3D cadaster project, the whole building is modeled
by using photogrammetric data, while individual units are modeled by using their projects stored in
the land registry. Therefore, the last ﬂoor of the four-story building and the individual units located
on this ﬂoor cannot be represented. As a result, a 3D cadastral representation does not necessarily
reﬂect the real situation it represents. Since the cadaster is concerned with legal objects, a solution
(e.g., zoning amnesty) is needed to ensure representation of these objects in a 3D cadaster.
Dierences between physical and legal objects should be recognized. Boundaries of the legal
objects (rights) do not necessarily coincide with physical objects, therefore it is not the object which
is registered in cadaster but only the legal space (2D /3D) related to the individual unit. Since there
is a strong relationship between the represented legal object (maintained by the cadaster) and the
represented physical object, the physical and legal representations should be updated consistently
within a given amount of reasonable time when a individual units is updated [9,62].
In essence, the 3D cadastral objects are the content and partition of space, and they aim to register
legal status and property rights associated with land and other real estates or properties. To deﬁne
the 3D cadastral object, represent its 3D space, and associate it with its attributes and rights become
the key contents for the 3D cadastral system [ 14]. The boundaries of the 3D cadastral space not only
describe the geometric locations but also carry legal meanings concerning the legal rights of space
occupation. 3D cadasters aim to manage the 3D space of 3D objects by using 3D geometry to representLand 2020 ,9, 179 11 of 17
the 3D property unit [ 63–65]. The 3D cadaster project assumes that physical buildings have consistent
boundaries in legal space. Meanwhile, the 3D cadastral space uniﬁes the physical construction space
with the legal space. Although a 3D cadastral object occupies some space, its space may not be fully
ﬁlled by physical entities.
4.2. Organizational Aspects
Cadastral systems can only exist within an organizational framework. Therefore, the organizational
aspects of the 3D cadaster are related to the duties and responsibilities of the land registration and
cadastral surveying organizations [ 66]. A workﬂow must be provided to produce 3D data for modeling
3D representations of individual units beyond pilot studies. Current workﬂow needs to change to
require architects to submit the requisite information to create the 3D models of individual units.
In Turkey, responsibility of both land registration and cadastral surveying belongs to the GDLRC.
The GDLRC is a liated to the MEU. The GDGIS, which is responsible for deﬁning national spatial
data standards, is also a liated to the MEU. In this way, there is a coordination in the standards of
registration, mapping and cadastral data. Besides the GDLRC, stakeholders such as municipalities,
licensed surveyors, civil engineers, architects, and lawyers are involved in the registration process
of individual units. Development of the 3D visualization of individual units in the cadaster needs
agreement from the stakeholders.
In general, cadastral organizations are not particularly open to changes. Changing the current
registration workﬂow is not easy, especially in countries where the state provides a guarantee of title [ 6].
The legal task of the cadaster and land registry is to survey and record property boundaries of real
estate and to provide information on these. Even though 3D modeling and visualization of individual
units improve the registration, the organizations seem reluctant to obtain these improvements because
of uncertainties (e.g., deﬁning 3D property boundaries). Although research on 3D cadaster has been
conducted for many years, GDLRC was only able to start the 3D cadaster project in 2018. Financing
such a high-cost project is not easy because it is di cult to express the economic value of better
representation of the legal situation. The Presidential Decree and the Action Plan (see Introduction
section), which were put into practice in the end of 2019 in Turkey, show that government will play a
leading and coordinating role in the transition from 2D to 3D digital representation, ensuring improved
datasets and workﬂows.
The registered legal objects may not necessarily coincide with physical objects. However a link
between a physical and a legal registration within the Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) enables
eciently checking the consistency between the two. Organizational arrangements have to be made to
resolve the di erences and to make sure that after changes at the side of the physical objects also the
legal counterpart is updated. A solution is creating 3D legal space and referring from the cadaster
system to the corresponding 3D descriptions in external registrations of representations of the physical
individual units. The solution requires the use of a SDI to access information on physical objects.
The idea behind this solution is that the cadaster can beneﬁt from distributed registrations within
a SDI by dynamically linking information from physical objects maintained in di erent databases.
In this approach, geometry of individual units can be maintained at their original source outside the
responsibility of cadaster, although this information can be accessed from cadaster whenever it is
needed [67].
4.3. Technical Aspects
The most progress in 3D cadastral research and development has been in technical aspects.
Advances in the acquisition, modeling, and visualization of 3D data have contributed to this
development for the past two decades [ 68]. Also, in recent years, the relationship between 3D
models of the physical world and legal entities has become more visible thanks to BIM models.
Data acquisition is the most time-consuming and labor-intensive part of the 3D cadaster project,
due to the di culty of interpreting the existing legal documents and geometric control of 3D models.Land 2020 ,9, 179 12 of 17
These operations require time and experienced sta . When the project is completed, it will be possible
to represent the individual units of buildings in a 3D digital environment together with their legal
information. However, one of the important issues is keeping the 3D digital data up-to-date. Therefore,
the information of the new building and individual units should be inserted into the cadastral database
automatically. For this, the need for technical sta who can work with 3D models, especially in
small municipalities, will need to be met. The creation of 3D data may not be justiﬁable for cadastral
purposes alone. Therefore, multi-purpose use of digital models of individual units for city planning
and management should be taken into account for spatial data infrastructures [69].
First visualization examples of the ongoing project were prepared for simple structures. Geometries
of selected individual units in 3D models are relatively simple compared to the geometries of the
3D physical objects in CAD models. Technical issues such as modeling complex property units and
modeling objects with curved faces should be further studied. Also, information about accuracy of the
3D cadaster project should be provided. Drawings of individual units have already been provided
with digital ﬁles for many years but it will be more di cult to interpret and convert the data for too old
buildings without drawings or, for old buildings, drawings that have been drawn by hand. Therefore,
accuracy of the data conversion should be given special attention. Also, 3D visualization should be
improved by using tools such as object selection, object query, navigation, and measurement.
An important question is how the z-coordinates of 3D objects should be deﬁned: as absolute
values (in the national coordinate frame) or relative to the earth’s surface (e.g., 10 meters above the
surface). In the 3D cadaster project, z-coordinates of the 3D objects will be deﬁned in absolute values.
Absolute z-coordinates are not inﬂuenced by surface changes; furthermore, the deﬁnition of the surface
level is sometimes not clear, and ﬁnally, using z-coordinates with respect to the surface can complicate
the deﬁnition of the geometry of 3D objects. Therefore, the most sustainable solution is to deﬁne 3D
objects with absolute z-coordinates [ 70]. In addition, the horizontal position error of a 3D model for
the 3D cadaster project cannot exceed 30 cm. Also, the area error of a 3D model is determined based
on the building area. For example, the area error of the 3D model must not be larger than 10% of the
building area for buildings with an area less than 100 m2. It must not be larger than 5% of the building
area for buildings between 100 m2and 500 m2. Digital aerial images for the project are produced in
10 cm ( 2 cm) GSD (Ground Sample Distance).
At this stage of the study, the ongoing 3D cadaster project in Turkey was compared to similar
recent studies in some countries. In Australia [ 22], the Netherlands [ 11], and Sweden [ 71], there are
studies on the 3D representation of individual units in cadasters. Several 3D models were developed
by digitizing the survey plans of 5 buildings and 200 individual units in Australia. Then, a web-based
dissemination prototype was improved to visualize the models in 3D. Geometrical accuracy of the
models was matched with the accuracy of the unit sketches. Individual units that are modeled in
3D as KML encoded ﬁles were visualized together with 2D cadastral parcels. In the Netherlands,
BIM-based 3D models were developed by using the footprints of buildings in cadastral maps together
with the drawings in the notarial deeds. With these models, the building and individual units were
visualized in 3D in GIS and Web environments. Then, 3D models were connected with 2D cadastral
parcels. Geometrical accuracy was associated with the accuracy of the drawings in the notarial deeds.
In Sweden, IFC-based 3D models of legal and physical spaces of buildings were developed by using
drawings from property formation dossiers. These models were visualized in 3D in GIS and CAD
environments. Geometrical accuracy was matched with the accuracy of the cadastral index map.
Results of the comparison are summarized in Table 1.Land 2020 ,9, 179 13 of 17

5. Conclusions
The inadequacy of the existing cadastral systems in representing some property situations that
emerge in the modern world has led to an increase in research and development towards 3D cadaster
for the last twenty years. In this paper, studies for the 3D digital representation of the cadastral data
in Turkey are evaluated. In connection with this, some opportunities and challenges are revealed.
The 3D cadaster project aiming at 3D digital representation of individual units was started by GDLRC
in 2018. In Turkey, the number of registered individual units is approximately 20.9 million and an
average of 100 thousand OP application per year are submitted to municipalities for new buildings.
Only outlines of the buildings can be visible on cadaster maps in current practice. Therefore, with the
project, representation of cadastral data will be improved by showing distribution of individual units
in a building.
Generally, current legal and organizational frameworks in Turkey are advantageous for
providing 3D representation of individual units. The registration model (title registration) and
the law (Condominium Law) meet the need for the creation of property rights of individual units.
Also, the GDLRC is responsible for both registration and cadastral surveys, which facilitates data
exchange. Municipalities that are responsible for managing the permission and control processes
of constructions can send information used for registration to GDLRC in a digital environment.
In addition, the adoption of digital transformation as a state policy with the National Smart Cities
Strategy and Action Plan supports digital representation of property units.
Even though developments are available, describing 3D objects in cadastral registration poses a
challenge. New regulations may have to be introduced. Transition from current 2D representation
towards a 3D digital cadaster requires not only replacing analog drawings with 3D models but also
examining the workﬂow for forming the property units. In order to keep the 3D digital data sets
up-to-date, deﬁning the standards for the production of 3D digital models to be used in the registration
processes of the new buildings should be further studied. In addition, the use of di erent data
structures and platforms in modeling and visualization of 3D data should be examined. Regarding
technical aspects, representation of complex structures and curved faces should be investigated.
