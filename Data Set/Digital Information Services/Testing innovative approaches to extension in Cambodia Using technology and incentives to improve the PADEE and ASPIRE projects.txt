  ii Summary  
Agricultural productivity and profitabili ty are keys to improving the livelihoods of rural 
households and to poverty reduction. Governments of developing countries have 
allocated considerable resources to improve agricultural practices, encourage the use of improved intermediate outputs, and induce adoption of new available technologies among farmers. However, farmers do not always adopt new technologies, as they may 
not know about or how to use them. To overcome this constraint, governments and 
others have invested considerable resources in agric ultural extension programs.  
However, there is little convincing evidence that sending extension workers to farmers is 
a cost -effective way to improve farmer knowledge. Extension is not likely to be effective if 
extension workers lack adequate levels of education, training, or skills to transfer 
techniques and technologies. And extension workers visits are costly to monitor, due to 
the spatial dispersion of agriculture. Governments or others offering extension have 
found it difficult to design reliable mechanisms assessing the accountability and 
performance of extension workers.  
In this report, we describe two pilot interventions using Information and Communications 
Technology (ICT) conducted by Cambodia’s Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and 
Fisheries (MA FF) and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) to try to 
overcome these constraints. The interventions were both randomized and occurred 
within projects designed with the International Fund for Agricultural Development 
(IFAD) —the Project for Agricultural Development and Economic Empowerment (PADEE) 
and the Agriculture Services Programme for Innovation, Resilience and Extension 
(ASPIRE) . 
Within PADEE, we additively randomized two interventions to standard PADEE 
extension during the 2016 growing season. First, we tested e -PADEE software, 
developed to provide extension agents with tablets equipped with app- based information 
about seed recommendations and fertilizer applications based on soil testing results, and 
identification and treatment of  crop diseases. Second, we test whether performance -
based incentives increase information dissemination through e -PADEE.   
Within ASPIRE, we used a push -message based system for delivering extension 
messages and randomized the frequency and intensity of message receipt during the 
2017 growing season. The messages involved rice, chicken, and vegetable farming, 
timed to the agricultural calendar. Randomization involved four groups — a “basic 
message” group, in which we will push basic messages to the group; “enhanced 
messages”, in which messages were more frequent and timed to the agricultural season; 
“enhanced messages plus”, in which we added farmers outside the farmer group to 
receive messages; and a control group, which received ASPIRE as usual.  
We use baseline and endline surveys to understand how the interventions changed 
treatment groups relative to the control group. We are first interested in whether the two 
interventions led to increases in knowledge of agricultural practices taught through the 
messagi ng systems. Second, we test whether increased knowledge led to the adoption 
of new agricultural practices or increased expenditures on agricultural inputs. Adoption of 
new practices or increased expenditures could lead to increases in agricultural yields; iii yield improvements could be reflected as increases in agricultural income and value of 
production per hectare. In both pilots, we look for immediate impacts; however, 
productivity impacts might take time to build up after repeated extension interactions.  
Within the PADEE intervention, we find evidence that software use was effective at 
teaching farmers additional rice extension messages, some of which farmers 
implemented. We did not find differences between the two treatment groups. Farmers in 
the treatment  groups were about 50 percent more likely to report receiving agricultural 
extension than the control group, and the percentage of farmers reporting using seed 
and fertilizer recommendations increased by about 5 and 12 percentage points, respectively. Howe ver, we do not find any impacts on rice production or productivity.  
In the ASPIRE pilot, we find the messages were popular among farmers receiving them. Even after 12 weeks of messages, about 60 percent of farmers listened to entire messages. Farmers repor t finding the messages increased their production, and we find 
further evidence that messages spread around the village beyond call recipients. All the effects were stronger with the enhanced message groups. Calls on rice and chickens 
were more likely to be called useful than those on vegetables. Though we find an 
increase in rice fertilizer use among one of the two enhanced message groups, we do not find production or income impacts caused by the calls.  
We estimate the e -PADEE intervention has average and marginal costs of at least 
$10.48 per farmer. The marginal costs of the ASPIRE intervention are much lower, at a maximum of $2.39 per farmer, and represents actual rather than prospective 
beneficiaries. As ASPIRE is spending at least $56 per prospective beneficiary, adding 
direct calls would appear justified on a cost effectiveness basis, even if evidence on 
increased productivity is only based on farmers’ beliefs about their productivity. As a call -
in system is now generally available in Cambodia, it would be useful to encouraging 
farmers to use the system to help increase their knowledge of current recommendations.  iv Contents

Agricultural productivity and profitability are keys to improving the livelihoods of rural households 
and to poverty reduction. Governments of developing countries have allocated considerable resources to improve agricultural practices, encourage the use o f improved intermediate outputs, 
and induce the adoption of new available technologies among farmers. However, farmers do not always adopt these technologies.  One likely explanation is that farmers –  with low average levels 
of education, living in remote and poorly connected areas – just do not know about improved 
practices or new production processes; even when access exists, farmers sometimes do not know how to use those technologies optimally.  This notion has led governments and other agencies to 
inves t considerable resources in agricultural extension programs.  
 
However, convincing evidence of the causal impact of extension programs on farmers’ agricultural 
productivity has proved to be elusive. One constraint is certainly methodological limitations of  
previous studies, as there are challenges relate d to selection, program placement bias, and 
potentially confounding programs, among others. But sending individuals to advise farmers directly is also expensive; if extension workers lack adequate levels of education, training, or skills to transfer innovative skills and technologies to farmers, extension is not likely to be effective even as it is costly  (Feder et al 1999; Swanson and Rajalahti 2010) . A further problem with extension 
is that visits by extens ion workers are costly to monitor, due to the spatial dispersion of agriculture . 
Governments or others offering extension have found it difficult to put in place reliable 
mechanisms to assess the performance and increase the accountability of extension wor kers.    
 
In this project, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) has worked with the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (MAFF) to test methods of overcoming constraints 
related to information provision, cost effectiveness, and monitoring through the use of Information 
and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in providing timely advice on agricultural practices.  
During the period of the grant, MAFF was running two projects funded by the International Fund 
for Agricultural Devel opment (IFAD). Through discussion with MAFF, it was decided to pilot 
interventions to innovate on extension in both projects.  First, the Project for Agricultural 
Development and Economic Empowerment (PADEE) worked to improve agricultural productivity 
and diversification of income sources for rural households in its five target provinces.  PADEE 
took place between 2012 and 2018, and the IFPRI pilot intervention took place in 2016 and 2017. 
The second project,  Agriculture Services Programme for Innovation, R esilience and Extension 
(ASPIRE), began in 2016 and will run until 2021.   ASPIRE was conceived to have two phases; 
the first phase is working in 5 provinces not included in PADEE (Kampong Chhnang, Pursat, 
Battambang, Preah Vihear and Kratie); in the second phase, beginning in 2019 , the PADEE 
provinces will be added.  
The impact  evaluations conducted with P ADEE and ASPIRE were timed to provide input into the 
second phase of ASPIRE when expansion was planned to occur. One of the primary rationales 
for ASPIRE is that public support for agricultural development in Cambodia is not pr esently 
efficiently delivered.  Therefore,  the impact evaluation was designed from the outset to test what 
can be considered inexpensive additions to a basic model of government extension delivery, 
though it is also hoping to catalyse private sector involv ement in extension.  The impact evaluation 2 highlight s technologies that could be used by the private sector, and at a time in which the results 
can be useful for scale up during the second phase of ASPIRE.  
The basic model of intervention in both PADEE and ASPIRE have been farmer field schools 
(FFS).  Two systematic reviews have examined the impacts of FFS on farmer outcomes ; 
Waddington et al. (2014) and Waddington and White (2014) focus on understanding the 
systematic impacts of FFS, while Phillips et al. ( 2014 ) focus on how FFS are targeted. For the 
purposes of this report, Waddington et al. (2014) is more meaningful.  They  review 90 studies on 
the impacts of FFS,  finding that only 15 studies can be rated less than “high risk” for bias. The 
review generally finds that FFS can be effective at increasing knowledge and in promoting the 
use of effective practices. They also find that FFS increase agricultural yields by 13 pe rcent and 
profits by 19 percent.   it is worth noting two points.  First, none of the cited evidence is derived 
from randomized control trials; the only randomized control trial we could find on FFS is Guo et al. (2015), which examines the impacts of FFS on rice production, by attempting to teach farmers to use less fertilizer.  They find an increase in knowledge of pest management, but no change in 
fertilizer use.  Second, the follow -up time period varies greatly among the studies considered by 
Waddington et  al. (2014); the shortest is less than a year, with the longest being 7 years. 
Therefore, impacts noted above are averaged over that time period.  
Within PADEE, we randomize two potential mechanisms to attempt to address problems 
related to information provision and monitoring, though they are randomized in an additive 
fashion.  First, we test e -PADEE software, that was developed to provide extension agents with 
tablets equipped with specialized software with information about soil testing results , seed 
recommendations, fertilizer applications, and identification and treatment of crop diseases. In a 
second arm of the trial, we test whether performance- based incentives can incentivize extension 
workers to make use of information available in the software to increase their effectiveness.  For these purpose s, we will gauge farmers’ knowledge of practices related to agricultural advice that 
extension services should provide. Extension workers in this arm were provided with monetary 
bonuses based on the percentage of correct answers of farmers in their catchment areas. The 
control group was defined as PADEE business as usual.  
Within ASPIRE, community extension workers (CEWs) who were mobilized were all given 
tablets with a number of different applications on them in mid-2017, making a second test of the 
e-PADEE software infeasible. We therefore worked with MAFF to consider alternatives to e-
PADEE rollout for randomization. We ended up focusing on using a push -message based system  
that used the same messages as e -PADEE for rice , and we developed further messages for 
vegetables and chicken rearing (in villages with a focus on chicken rearing through ASPIRE). We 
then pushed recorded messages to farmers’ and CEW’s phones, timed to the agricultural 
calendar.  Randomization involve d four groups, all of which are of particular interest to policy 
makers at MAFF and at the General Directorate for Agriculture ( GDA )— a “basic message” group, 
in which we will push basic messages to the group; “enhanced messages”, in which messages will be more frequent and timed to the agricultural season; “enhanced messages plus”, in which we are adding farmers outside of the farmer group that receiv ed the messages;  and a control 3 group, which receives ASPIRE as usual.  All of our treatments are therefore additive on top of the 
primary program.1 
 
In the pre -analysis plan initially submitted to 3ie, we did not explicitly write out research 
questions; rather, we discussed the research hypotheses  in the context , as described above, and 
specified the primary and secondary outcomes of interest. However, the pre- analysis plan filed 
did not cover the ASPIRE intervention. As a result, in a modification of the pre -analysis plan w e 
recast the primary  questions as follows:  
1. Can ICT methods strengthen the effectiveness of traditional extension in terms of farmer 
learning?  
2. Do ICT methods enhance the effectiveness of traditional extension on farming outcomes?  
3. How cost effective are ICT -related additions at increasing farmer’s learning / outcomes?  
4. Can financial incentives for extension workers improve the effectiveness of extension 
programs in developing countries?  
5. By reducing costs of information delivery and increasing the critical mass of informed 
farmers, can ICTs improve farmers’ knowledge and adoption of agricultural practices?  
Whereas the first three research questions relate to both projects, question 4 relates to the 
pilot within the PADEE intervention and question 5 relates to the pilot within the ASPIRE 
intervention.  The remainder of the report is structured as follows.  In the second section, we 
discuss the interventions in more detail, the theory of change in each case, and the research 
hypotheses. The third section places the study better in the context of agriculture in Cambodia, 
and the f ourth section provides a timeline of the two interventions. The fifth section provides a 
detailed description of the research design and implementation. The sixth section includes 
information on how the interventions were implemented in practice, and the s eventh section 
provides impact analysis and answers the key evaluation questions. The eighth section discusses 
the results, and the ninth section concludes with findings for policy and potential further research. 
In each section, because we are discussing two interventions, we first discuss the intervention 
within PADEE and then the one within ASPIRE.  
2 Intervention, theory of change and research hypotheses  
The interventions studied in this impact evaluation took place within the context of the PADEE 
and ASP IRE projects of MAFF. While there are differences in their implementation and 
mechanisms, both projects aim to increase smallholders’ agricultural productivity through 
innovations in extension. Both PADEE and ASPIRE follow something of a train- and-visit ex tension 
model in their basic workings,  with visits from extension workers.  
                                                
1 Note that an overall evaluation of ASPIRE is also taking place, and villages could not be randomized, so we decided 
not to include a “pure” control group as it would simply repeat the work being done by the group conducting the overall 
evaluation.  4 2.1 PADEE and the ePADEE Intervention  
PADEE was launched in five southern provinces (Kampot, Takeo, Kandal, Prey Veng, and Svay 
Rieng) of Cambodia in mid- 2012 and operated until 2017. Farmers in PADEE villages were 
grouped in learning groups with approximately 50 members and  received agricultural extension 
advice from a member of the Mobile Support Teams (MSTs). MSTs are itinerant extension 
workers and are civil servants staffed by MAFF’s District Agricultural Offices.  
As part of the PADEE operations, MAFF – in collaboration with the GDA, Gram een Intel, 
SNV, and iDE –  developed ePADEE, a specialized software for extension workers to provide 
them with information about seed choices, fertilizer application, and plant disease control related  
to rice production.2 ePADEE includes a module to analyze individual plot soil tests to provide 
personalized recommendations based on each farmer ’s needs. Software  content was developed 
by MAFF’s specialists based on Cambodia’s local agricultural conditions.  
A small group of MSTs were provided with tablets loaded with ePADEE and the software 
was tested in a small pilot by two NGOs (the SNV Netherlands Development Organization and 
International Development Enterprises - IDE) throughout 2015. Each MST worked with an 
average of 7 farmers in the pilot, so few PADEE beneficiaries had been exposed to ePADEE in 
general. Furthermore, the impacts of using ePADEE could not be established from the pilot, since 
there was no survey and no attempt to establish a counterfactual. Consequently, it was of interest 
to both MAFF and Grameen Intel to help devise an evaluation of the e- PADEE product, to observe 
whether it would make sense to integrate it into plans for ASPIRE.  
2017 was effectively the last year that PADEE was implemented, due to budget constraints 
that led it to be closed earlier than had been originally planned. Meanwhile, ASPIRE operations 
began slowly in 2016, but became more widespread by 2017.  The PADEE provinces are 
scheduled to be added to ASPIRE in 2019, so any lessons from the pilot can be directly brought 
into the same geography when these provinces are added to ASPIRE.  
2.2 ASPIRE and Direct Calls  
ASPIRE is being implemented in five provinces that were previously not targeted by PADEE 
(Battambang, Pursat, Kampong Chhnang, Preah Vihear, and Kratie;  Figure 1). The basic 
extension model in ASPIRE is similar to the one in PADEE: farmers are organized in learning groups and extension workers provide them with agricultural advice. However, ASPIRE 
incorporates local community members that act as liaisons between extension work ers and 
farmers. Each village has a Commune Extension Worker (CEW) to facilitate relations with 
farmers. The goal is that CEWs can both share information with farmers in their assigned 
                                                
2 iDE, which operates a social enterprise called Lors Thmey, continued to use ePADEE after the completion of both the 
pilot and the set up of the impact evaluation.  In doing so, they have developed a module for vegetable farming that is 
meant to try to help develop a profitable business including extension.  After their involvement in PADEE, however, 
they stopped working with the government.  5 villages —each CEW  is assigned six villages —and to also help private act ors liaise with villages 
who might purchase their inputs or provide specific types of outputs.  
 
Note: Authors’ Calculations, GADM database of global administrative areas (boundaries).  
 
In early 2017, the decision was made to provide all CEWs who had begun work in 2016 with 
tablets that would be pre- loaded with information to potentially share with farmers. As a result, 
there were several difficulties w ith attempting to continue the e -PADEE pilot within ASPIRE 
 
Figure 1. Map of Cambodia, with highlighted PADEE and ASPIRE Provinces  6 provinces. First, at least in theory, CEWs will have access to a great deal of information, which 
would potentially swamp out the information from e- PADEE. A second concern came up 
discussing the G rameen Intel software going forward, which was that it did not provide for peer -
to-peer information flows, and third, because of the contracting process being followed by the 
government, there is an additional challenge in keeping ePADEE application up-to-date as 
conditions, recommendations, and input availabilities change. Finally, training costs would be 
substantial as would additional political buy -in, since some CEWs would require the ePADEE 
software while others would not be allowed to have it, so sepa rate or additional trainings would 
need to take place, and provincial authorities would have to approve the differences in tablets and training for some but not all CEWs. Given all these challenges, it was decided to conduct an alternative innovative test within ASPIRE.  
 
Through discussions with IFAD and MAFF, we all agreed upon an alternative test, which was 
to use a push -message based system, which calls farmers on a weekly basis with basic extension 
messages.
3 The rice messages directly mirrored the basi c rice extension messages in the 
ePADEE software, but farmers were also offered messages on either growing vegetables (long 
beans and cucumbers) or rearing chickens, based on choices made by farmer groups in their 
villages for 2016. The messages were deliv ered through a firm called VOTO Mobile (now Viamo 
mobile). MAFF collaborated with IFPRI on developing the messages out of their training manuals.  
We pushed the recorded messages to farmers’ and CEW’s phones, timed to the agricultural 
calendar.  
2.3 Primary Outc omes  
Our project revolves around two primary research hypotheses, one of which is tested under both 
projects and one of which is tested only in the PADEE intervention.  First, we hypothesize that 
ICT based extension can be an appropriate tool for making ex tension more cost -effective. By 
effective, we mean that it can lead to additional farmer learning and better farming outcomes, including improved yields and farm revenue.  Second, we hypothesize that better incentive mechanisms for extension workers can lead to improved interactions between farmers and 
extension workers. Our outcomes of interest are as follows:  
Have a positive effect on farmers’ knowledge of agricultural practices:  We will collect farmers’ 
knowledge of different “families” of practices: ade quate fertilizer application, seed selection, and 
management of crop diseases; vegetable production techniques; chicken rearing knowledge, etc. 
We will create indexes for each family using the methodology outlined by Kling et al (2007), who 
propose creatin g summary measures by adding normalized outcomes .4 We will also create an 
aggregate measure that will include practices in all families created for each intervention.  
                                                
3 Incidentally, in discussing text messaging as a possible delivery mechanism, we learned that many Cambodian 
farmers do not often text, because many of the phones do not support the Khmer script. So we did not send text 
messages, only pushed phone messages.  
4 Any particular outcome will be excluded when there is limited variation in the answers (e.g., everyone answers 
“Yes”  or if everyone reports similar values).  7 Lead to adoption of new agricultural practices:  Similarly, we will measure adoption by cr eating 
indexes for the adoption of practices across families of practices (adequate fertilizer application, 
seed selection, and management of crop diseases, vegetable production, chicken rearing 
knowledge) and an aggregate measure of the three families. This outcome will reflect the 
intensive measure by which farmers are adopting potentially beneficial practices.  
Lead to larger expenditures on selected agricultural inputs:  To measure the extensive measure 
of adoption of practices , we will investigate whether the interventions increase farmers’ 
expenditures on selected agricultural inputs . This will be measured by the households’ 
expenditures in adequate fertilizers, seeds, and recommended inputs required to treat or prevent crop diseases.  
Increase  in agricultural yields:  We will measure agricultural yields by dividing the total harvest 
achieved by farmers during an agricultural season by the number of hectares allocated to crops, at least for rice.  We will test both the yield as w ell as the logarithm of yields.  
Increase farmers’ agricultural income: We will measure farmers’ income from agricultural 
activities, including cropping and poultry income.  We will compute agricultural income by adding up the value of crops produced, using  prices either internally generated by the survey (average 
prices for sold product within the household, or the median at the village level if the household did not sell) or from detailed surveys conducted by our partners, the Cambodian Development Researc h Institute, if not available for some rarely traded vegetables.  We will then subtract input 
costs.  
Increase value of production per hectare. Finally, we will take both gross and net values of 
agricultural production and divide by land size, to measure whether households increase crop 
income on a per land unit basis.  
2.4 Theory of Change  
We hypothesize a reasonably straightforward theory of change for improving extension in Cambodia through innovations  (Figure 2). First, we consider the pathway through direct 
beneficiaries.  We hypothesize that new models of agricultural extension will lead to increased 
awareness or knowledge of different agricultural practices or techniques. We assume direct beneficiaries want to participate in the additional extension. The techniques depend a bit upon the type of extension.  For example, improved extension can lead to will lead to increased 
awareness of more appropriate inputs (seeds, fer tilizer, pesticides, herbicides) and practices (e.g. 
timing of fertilizer application; placement of seeds ). To ensure that the innovative extension model 
leads to improved knowledge, several assumptions must be met. Information must be tailored 
appropriately for farmers, and those in charge of delivering an extension model must actually 
disseminate the messages. In the case of the MSTs in PADEE, we further test whether improved 
incentives for delivering extension will lead to improved delivery; t he assumption is that incentives 
are large enough to catalyse the work required.  
 
 8 Figure 2. Schematic of theory of change 
 
We are also interested in potential spill -overs of information from those who participate to those 
who do not participate, or indirect beneficiaries. For these potential beneficiaries, the information 
flow must come through beneficiaries rather than through the project; we must assume that the 
information flow occurs and that it is accurate.  If so, it would l ead to increased knowledge about 
improved practices among those non- participants.  Given that there may be less information in 
that flow, we may further want to assume that such flows will be weaker than flows directly through 
the intervention.  
The remainder of the theory of change is the same for direct and indirect beneficiaries.  The 
increase in knowledge leads to adoption of the new practices. Here, we assume that farmers 
perceive the new practices to be beneficial, and that they are willing to take the risk of attempting 
adoption. If they adopt practices, then we can observe increases in agricultural productivity, within 
the targeted product, and potentially agricultural income as well. For those final outcomes to 
occur, we must also assume that farmers implement enough new practices to increase their 
productivity. Here, we are using an expansive definition of productivity; we could mean yields, but we could also mean quality improvements that do not necessarily lead to higher yields but do lead to higher  farmgate prices for products.  It is worth noting that this process may take more time than 
is generally allowed for in the impact evaluation; for example, if farmers begin to experiment with 
techniques that can be derived from additional knowledge, then we might not observe initial 
impacts on productivity at the endline, but potentially could if there was more time available 
between rounds. Nevertheless, in the theory the increased productivity would lead to higher 
welfare levels, therefore increasing resilience against shocks through self -insurance.  
Within each project, the assumptions that we make slightly differ. For the PADEE 
intervention, we posit that increases in the (correct) information through ePADEE will potentially 
9 lead to the benefits noted above.  We are also  specifically considering rice yields; we then assume 
that revenues also increase because quality does not decline (which would reduce prices).  
In the ASPIRE intervention, we make the same assumption that additional information 
through the direct phone cal ls will also lead to the above benefits. We need to first assume that 
people will accept the phone calls, as well as have their phones electrically charged at most times 
to receive those calls.  We must assume that the right person can listen to the calls, and then we 
assume that the person finds the messages useful and listens to the calls.  If all of that occurs, 
then for impacts beyond knowledge retention the farmer must act on the knowledge from the calls 
and experiment either with techniques or new crops/methods of raising chickens to experience 
yield impacts or revenue impacts.  We finally assume that the calls are interesting enough for 
people in villages to talk about them, at which time there can be indirect effects among non -
recipients.   We need not make any ass umptions about CEW behaviour, since they do not 
participate in the intervention itself.  
This discussion suggests that we broadly categorize the outcomes listed in the previous section 
as intermediate and final outcomes. Intermediate outcomes relate to impr oved knowledge.  We 
will directly ask about knowledge of recommended agricultural practices after asking about 
information diffusion, so we understand whether such measures change as a result of the pilots 
within PADEE and ASPIRE, relative to business as u sual  Improved knowledge does not 
necessarily lead to behaviou r change; in terms of behaviou r change we examine self -reported 
measures of use of techniques after we have asked about knowledge of each technique.   
Final outcomes include productivity and wel fare.  We will measure productivity through the 
household survey and we will measure welfare primarily through per capita and per adult 
equivalent expenditures, also through the household survey.   
3 Context  
Both PADEE and ASPIRE programs featured agricultur al extension components. In general, both 
PADEE and ASPIRE selected areas with agricultural potential and vulnerability to poverty. IFAD 
rolled out PADEE in five Cambodian provinces in 2012. In 2015, it started the implementation of 
ASPIRE in five additional provinces. Upon the end of PADEE in 2017 -2018, it planned to include 
the five PADEE provinces into the ASPIRE program. According to the 2008 population census, 
the ten provinces of both programs cover about 50% of the total population of Cambodia. Recently, the ASPIRE loan was expanded so that the remaining provinces could be covered in 
its second phase.  
The study sites for the ePADEE pilot were selected randomly from a sample of all sites in which 
PADEE was slated to continue to work in 2016.  Since we included all five provinces, we have to 
assume that the villages were broadly representative of the provinces in which PADEE operated. 
The threat to this assumption is that the final villages in which PADEE operated could have 
systematically differed from other villages; however, there is not an obvi ous data source with 
which we can test this assertion.  10 The ASPIRE provinces were chosen a bit less systematically, as we had to choose provinces 
in which enough activity had occurred in 2016 fo r our sampling pur poses.  All  the resulting villages 
were in Battambang and Pursat provinces.  Again, there is not an obvious data source to examine 
for representativeness. However, we can look at some simple statistics from the latest (2014) 
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) to consider how the selected provinces differ from rural 
Cambodia as a whole, and then we examine some statistics from our baseline surveys against surveys conducted for evaluating the PADEE and ASPIRE programs, respectively.  The DHS is 
well known as  a high quality data source, but does not collect much economic information; we 
decide to measure three measures at least somewhat correlated with multidimensional measures of poverty. In particular, the last measure (the child stunting rate) is often strongly correlated with 
poverty.  
To provide a some sense of how the selected provinces look relative to rural Cambodia in 
terms of poverty, we examine three indicators of nutrition from the DHS surveys: the anaemia rate 
and stunting rate for under 5 year olds , and the proportion of women of child bearing age with a 
low Body Mass Index (BMI).
5 The DHS demonstrates that the seven provinces are largely 
distributed around the averages for all of rural Cambodia ( Table 1).  Children in the PADEE 
provinces appear a bit better off than the rural areas of the overall  country, whereas  women 
appear approx imately average in terms of low BMI.  The opposite is true in the two ASPIRE 
provinces; whereas  Pursat has quite poor child nutrition statistics, they are relatively good in 
Battambang; they average to being about the same as rural Cambodia as a whole. In terms of 
women’s BMI, the two ASPIRE provinces appear slightly better off than other provinces.

5 Stunting is defined as having a height -for-age z score below -2; women are considered to be underweighted/ low BMI 
if their BMI is below 18.5 (and they are not pregnant).  11 3.1 PADEE  Context  
PADEE’s beneficiaries were determined using a two- step approach. First, PADEE selected the 
project’s intervention communes. The Provincial Departments of Agriculture (PDAs) proposed an 
initial list of communes for the project, based on the following criter ia: (a) high incidence of poverty 
and large numbers of poor households, (b) agricultural potential, (c) exposure to natural hazards, 
(d) food insecurity over the year, (e) vulnerability of women and children, and (d) commitment of 
administrative councils t o work with communities and farmers. This initial list of communes was 
further streamlined by: (a) excluding urban communities, (b) excluding communes with less than 
200 poor households or less than 500 hectares for rice cultivation; (c) excluding communes  with 
poverty rates smaller than 19%. To maximize the cos t-effectiveness of the implementation of the 
project, PADEE ruled out all districts with five or less communes meeting these criteria. Within 
the remaining districts, PADEE prioritized the poorest ei ght communes for their program. As a 
result of this selection process, the project targeted 246 communes in 36 districts.  
Once the communes were determined, beneficiaries were selected following a participatory 
wealth ranking approach. The project convened meetings with villagers, community councils, 
village chiefs, and district staff. Meeting participants ranked village households based on their own perceptions and definitions of poverty. The fifty poorest households were invited to participate 
in the pro ject. A final filter was applied to ensure willingness to participate and carry out 
responsibilities associated with the program.  
To attempt to consider the external validity of our study, we compare make a few comparisons 
with the PADEE areas, we use stat istics on four variables generated from the overall PADEE 
baseline that are available at the provincial level ( Table 2). We find some differences between our 
baseline and the overall PADEE baseline. First, we find that households in our sample are 
somewhat larger; note, the same was found in the PADEE evaluat ion midline survey ( SBK 
Research and Development,  2016). We find similar patterns of availability of mainline electricity; 
as in the evaluation baseline, most households in our sample have electricity in Kandal and 
Takeo, but fewer in Kampot and Prey Veng.  In Svay Rieng, few households have electricity.  Rice 
yields in our sample are more variable than in the evaluation baseline, but they are also based on 
smaller samples, so the means are more variable.  Finally, we find fewer households grow fruits 
and vegetables, though our survey did not ask specifically about fruits , unlike the PADEE 
evaluation baseline, so in a relative sense our measures are biased slightly downwards. In 
general, between results on household size and rice yields, we believe that the external validity for the remainder of the PADEE areas is reasonable.

Notes: PADEE evaluation baseline included ¼ of the sample outside communes targeted for PADEE; reports did not 
include standard deviations or standard errors. ePADEE baseline only asked specifically about types of vegetables and not about fruits.  
3.2 ASPIRE C ontext  
ASPIRE began its operations in 2016 in five additional provinces not covered under the PADEE 
program. These provinces were selected based on their potential to increase agricultural GDP and the capabilities of the Provincial Departments of Agriculture. Based on these criteria the 
program selected the following five provinces: Kratie, Preah Vihear, Battambang, Pursat, and 
Kampong Chhnang. ASPIRE will expand into the five PADEE provinces in 2019.  
Within the initial five  provinces, their targeting diffe red somewhat from that in PADEE. ASPIRE 
aimed to target communes that would maximize the cost -effectiveness of extension programs, a 
relatively recent view of the government.  Therefore, it began targeting with communes that were 
believed to have considerable unrealized agricultural potential: it included those where significant 
production gains could be achieved, excluding those that already had high productivity levels. While ASPIRE targeted poor farmers, it also theoretically reaches out to somewhat non -poor 
farmers who are vulnerable to risks and shocks.   
Within communes, they targeted both poor farmers and non- poor farmers. In the  view 
expressed in the project design document , “the participation of less poor smallholders is also 
important from the know ledge dissemination point of view as this type of farmers are better 
situated to try and demonstrate new technologies to the effect that poorer and more risk averse 
farmers can observe the results and adopt  (IFAD, 2014 ).”  
The overall ASPIRE evaluation baseline was based on a much smaller sample than the 
PADEE evaluation (340 households versus 3050 households).  Therefore, the report based on 13 the baseline did not include provincial breakdowns for most variables ( SBK Research and 
Development , 2017). Moreover , it did not ask about electricity access, so in describing means 
from the ASPIRE evaluation baseline against our sample to assess external validity , we replace 
that variable with “ID Poor” status, which is a program developed by the Cambodian government 
to identify poor households and target them with assistance. Note that the initial ASPIRE baseline 
sample is small and so likely has relatively large standard errors associated with measures; the 
report to the government cited above did not include standar d errors.  
 Perhaps not surprisingly, w e find that the households in our sample appear to be worse off 
than in the ASPIRE baseline in general  (Table 3).  Whereas household size is similar on average, 
the ID Poor rate is almost 10 percentage points higher, and almost equals to the rate of ID Poor 
households generally in each province (32.6 percent in Battambang according to the Ministry of 
Planning, and 22.8 percent in Pursat).  Not surprisingly, rice yields are a bit lower in our sample than the ASPIRE evaluation baseline, but more households grow vegetables.  Recall, however, 
that the IFPRI sample includes a majority of non- farmer group members, while in t heory the 
ASPIRE baseline should only include farmer group members. So whereas our results will not be 
externally valid for ASPIRE participants, they will reflect a larger portion of the rural population of 
the two selected provinces.

15 5 Evaluation: Design, methods and implementation  
 
In this section, we describe the ev aluation of the two innovations in PADEE and ASPIRE, 
which took place through clustered randomized control trials (RCTs). To ensure that the two RCTs 
were implemented ethically, the plans were reviewed by IFPRI’s Institutional Review Board (IRB, 
which has Federal -wide Assurance no. FWA00005121). As is often common in developing 
countries and  trials that do not involve measures of health, there is no corresponding review board 
in Cambodia.  As plans evolved amendments were sent to the IFPRI IRB on an annual basis.  
5.1 PADEE Evaluation Strategy  
The evaluation of ePADEE took place through a clustered randomized control trial.  The randomized control trial involved two treatments and one control group.  We call the two treatment 
groups the ICT and ICT Plus groups, respectively. The two treatments are described in more detail below.  
The ICT group is c omprised by 20 villages where the MSTs assigned to work in these villages 
receive a tablet loaded with the ePADEE software. The ICT Plus  group is comprised of 20 villages 
where the MSTs assigned to work in these villages receive a tablet loaded with the eP ADEE 
software receive a bonus payment (incentive in addition to their base salary) based on their 
performance, as measured by the response of their assigned farmers to periodic monitoring 
telephone surveys. Each month, we randomly selected 6 farmers in eac h farmer group and test 
them with a ten- question quiz over their mobile phones. Three questions were “soft” questions, 
assessing whether the farmer had seen the MST in the village during the last month, had talked 
to him, and had received any useful advice. Other questions were based on knowledge of 
particular issues on which the MSTs should have been advising farmers. At the end of the season, 
each MST received a bonus payment based on the average of their performance across the 
season. Each MST group was monitored three times during the season, timed to specific timelines 
proposed in the software.  
Our impact evaluation sample (i.e., the one for which baseline and endline outcomes will be 
collected) is comprised of 20 farmers in each learning group. A concern is that MSTs might focus 
on farmers that evaluation has contacted before and not in the complete learning group (i.e., 
MSTs might be redistributing their effort and not necessarily increasing it). For this reason, all 20 
members of the learning groups w ere part of the performance -monitoring scheme.  
For both treatment groups, IFPRI, MAFF, and Grameen Intel staff collaborated to hold 
workshops in June- July 2016 to both re -teach the MSTs on how to use the software and reinforce 
the knowledge of the MSTs in both treatment groups. Each MST will receive payments through a 
mobile transfer provider in Cambodia (Wing), which includes a monthly allowance to finance their 
visits to the farmer group. The ICT Plus group receives a marginally lower base pay than the I CT 
group. At the end of the agricultural season the ICT Plus group receives a lump sum payment and an explanation of the payment using the performance monitoring results.  16 A third group of 20 villages was assigned to the Control  group. Villages in this group receive 
regular PADEE extens ion (non- ICT) through MAFF. These villages  have MSTs assigned to work 
with the learning groups , but the MSTs did not receive tablets with the ePADEE software and will 
not be eligible to receive performance- based bonus payments .  Moreover, the overall MAFF 
budget did not allow for many visits from MSTs in 2016.   
5.2 Sample Determination  in PADEE  
Throughout the length of the project, PADEE aimed to cover 2,367 villages in the provinces of 
Kampot, Takeo, Kandal, Prey Veng, and Svay Ri eng. Villages were rolled in and out of the 
program in different stages.  For the purposes of the ePADEE pilot project, we restricted our sample to villages in which: (a) PADEE would operate in 2016 (and presumably 2017); and that 
(b) MAFF had confirmed MS Ts assigned to them by early 2016. The resulting sampling framework 
consisted of 170 villages. These villages were linked to 85 MSTs (approximately 2 villages per 
MST).  
We then dropped villages in which anyone had experience with the ePADEE pilot and a few  
others in which we could not match the village to PADEE lists for that commune.  We were then 
left with 98 villages and 62 MSTs. We then randomly dropped one village per MST for those who 
continued to have two MSTs, leaving us with 62 MSTs and 62 villages . We finally randomly 
selected 60 of the 62 village -MST pairs for the intervention.  
The number of villages therefore selected in each province was roughly proportional to the 
share of villages each province had in the overall framework. As a result, the sample for our study 
in the PADEE project comprises 12 villages in Kampot, 10 in Kandal, 14 in Prey Veng, 11 in Svay Rieng, and 13 in Takeo. At that point, in collaboration with provincial MAFF offices we ensured 
that each of the 60 villages was assigned t o a different MST ; despite our efforts to assign one 
MST to each village, in two cases, an MST covered two villages  due to changed assignments 
within provincial offices . 
At that point, MAFF provided us with lists of approximately 50 farmers participating in the 
learning groups in each of the 60 villages in our study.  From the 50 farmers in each learning 
group, we randomly chose 20 farmers for our household surveys and to potentially participate in the additional intervention. Therefore, our  initial PADEE sample consists of 1,200 farmers across 
60 villages in these 5 provinces.  
We also conducted qualitative work as part of the PADEE fieldwork.  The qualitative work 
included two components, conducted in selected treatment  villages to understand farmers’ 
experiences with the ePADEE program  and with members of the mobile support team:  
1. Focus groups with farmer groups : Using the farmer groups in our study as a starting point, 
focus groups can be used to understand common issues with e- PADEE software, the level 
of trust for the extension system in general and actors within the agricultural support 
system more specifically, as well as the relative importance of extension in their production.  We will also explore what types of information farmers find valuable from 17 extension workers  and in particular what else they woul d like to obtain from extension 
worker s; e.g. how to tell fertilizer quality, help with vegetable crops, etc.  
2. In-depth interviews with Mobile Support Team members : To complement the information 
obtained from the focus groups, we plan to conduct in -depth interviews with MST 
members to understand how the e- PADEE software could be made more user friendly 
and how one might be able to use CEWs in the ASPIRE project to help coordinate any 
need for extension v isits, as well as to help understand how they perceive the incentives 
treatment if relevant.  
5.3 Assignment of Treatment in PADEE  
As previously stated, treatment was assigned for the e -PADEE intervention by randomization at 
the cluster or farmer group level.  Each farmer group was associated with an individual MST, and the randomization took place before the MST training described above so that the 40 MSTs being 
given refresher trainings on the ePADEE software would be chosen ahead of time.  The chosen 
sample i ncluded 10 villages in Prey Veng, 6 villages in Kandal, and 8 in Kampot, Svay Rieng, and 
Takeo, respectively. Randomization into the treatment groups was done through a random 
number generator in Washington. As the ICT treatment was being assigned at the v illage level, 
there were no concerns about  jealousies arising due to treatment status within villages.  
5.4 ASPIRE Evaluation Strategy  
The evaluation strateg y for direct phone calls to individuals in ASPIRE villages was developed 
through consultation with consultants working on information technologies within ASPIRE’s national coordination unit. In consultation with ASPIRE  and VOTO mobile, we determined that 
three randomized treatments and a control group would allow us to test different methods of 
delivering messages. Additionally, it was attractive to both the research team and MAFF to study 
farmers beyond the main farmer group, which is easy to do once meetings are not required.  
Henc e, we broke up the sampling plan into a group of members and non- members within each 
village, which we will describe later in the report.   
 
Therefore,  the three treatment groups were as follows.  First, there was a “basic messages 
group,” in which basic messages were pushed once to farmers. Second, there was an “enhanced 
messages group,” in which messages were repeated close to the time that action would need to take place within the season.  Third, there was an “enhanced messages plus” group, in which 
mess ages were pushed to 50 farmers outside of the main farmer group.  The idea behind the third 
group is that we can use that group to test whether a critical mass is required for the adoption of 
certain practices. Finally, we have a control group as the fourth group ; the control group is 
conducted in a “ASPIRE business as usual” fashion.   
 The original design was to measure spillovers from the basic and enhanced message groups 
into the non -farmer group members, and then to ensure that  the non -farmer group memb ers in 
the enhanced messages plus group received phone calls.  However, as implemented, in all three 18 treatment groups the non- members in the sample were included in phone call lists.  As a result, 
there is little difference between the enhanced messages and enhanced messages plus groups.  
5.5 Sample Determination in ASPIRE  
Beginning in 2016, IFAD and MAFF launched ASPIRE in Cambodia. In the first year of operation, 
the project planned to operate in 326 villages in the five provinces targeted by the project: Krat ie 
(65), Kampong Chhnang (72), Preah Vihear (51), Battambang (70), and Pursat (68).  Further 
villages were added to ASPIRE in 2017, but they were going to be added too late to include in 
the pilot project .  
However, we were  not able to fully confirm if the  project was able to meet its first-year goal in 
terms of villages  by the end of 2016, so as we negotiated a sample with the government, we 
determined where Commune Extension Workers (CEWs) had begun to work and in what villages.  
A further challenge also arose, as another firm conducted a baseline in some villages for an 
overall evaluation of ASPIRE, and we were asked to eliminate those villages from our potential 
sample. Finally, we realized we could not manage a sample in the same way as w e did under 
PADEE, linking one CEW with one specific village , as had been done in the ASPIRE evaluation.  
After eliminating villages in which the baseline survey had occurred, there were not (nearly) enough CEWs to match each CEW with a specific village, m eaning that some CEWs would need 
to be linked to more than one treatment.  
Given that the intervention that we agreed upon with MAFF did not require CEW involvement, 
we determined that the best method of sampling would be as follows.  Each CEW works with si x 
farmer groups; typically, the farmer groups were all in different villages . In some cases, however, 
CEWs worked with two farmer groups within the same village.  We first screened CEWs to ensure 
that they worked with at least four different villages that had not been included in the overall 
ASPIRE baseline and were working with rice and either chicken or vegetables. After this initial 
screen, there was only one CEW outside of Battambang and Pursat provinces, so we decided to 
only randomly sample CEWs from those two provinces  to save on data collection costs (see 
Figure 5 for an illustration of the sampling procedure). We sampled 18 CEWs from that remaining 
list. 
  19  
Figure 5. Schematic of Overall ASPIRE Sampling Procedure for CEWs 
 
In the second stage, we sampled 4 villages from among the up to 6 eligible villages for each 
selected CEW.  The CEW was used as an initial stratum, so one village was selected from each 
treatment or control group around each CEW, so that CEW fixed effects could be used in 
estimation.  Because the intervention does not involve the CEW, there is no concern about 
potential contamination. The sampling strategy at the CEW level is illustrated in Figure 6. The 
ASPIRE sample ended up comprised of 40 villages in Battambang and 32 villages in Pursat  after 
10 CEWs were selected in Battambang and 8 in Pursat, respectively.  
  
20 Figure 6. Illustration of ASPIRE Sampling of Villages around strata formed by CEWs 
 
The next challenge  was to select fa rmer group and non -farmer group members for the sample 
in each village. MAFF and IFAD provided us with the lists of farmers that were organized in farmer 
groups to participate in ASPIRE. In each village, farmer groups were comprised of between 17 
and 51 farmers. From this list, we randomly selected 10 farmers for our household surveys. In 
addition, we randomly selected 14 farmers not participating in ASPIRE from the village roster (see 
section 4 for the role of this group in the research design). Therefore,  our ASPIRE sample consists 
of 1,728 farmers across 72 villages in these 2 provinces; 10 farmers in ASPIRE learning groups 
and 14 outside of the ASPIRE learning groups.  Sample size was determined through power 
calculations detailed in Section 5.8. 
 
The farmer group component of the sample was simple to obtain; we simply sampled 10 of the 
farmer group members. However, sampling farmers in the non- farmer groups was not trivial.  To 
do so, we first came up with eligibility criteria.  We needed to ensure that households included in 
the sample were actually farmers.  Therefore, t o be included in the non- farmer group samples, 
households had to meet one of the following three criteria:  
1. Grew rice throughout a complete season (wet or dry) last year;  
2. Has a home  garden (where they allocate time and resources to prepare land and 
water the vegetables);  
3. Have a chicken fence or have at least five chickens (of 0.5 kg or more) for meat consumption or egg production, so fighting cocks were excluded.  
To then select farme rs outside the farmer groups, field supervisors first requested the household 
roster from the village chief.  Average village sizes in Battambang and Pursat was around 200 households.  Those lists were checked against the list of farmer group households, and all farmer 
group households were dropped. The next step was to sample remaining households 
21 systematically, by divi ding the total number of households by 14, which gives roughly equal size 
parts.  For example, if there were 140 households remaining, they  would split the list into 14 parts 
of 10.  Then they would start from a random number (N), and pick the Nth household from each 
partial list, giving a total of 14 selected households. That list would be checked by the village chief, 
who would verify whether selected households were farmers by the above criteria or not.  If not, 
then a list of non -farmers would be compiled, and the remaining sample would be split into parts 
based on the number of originally picked non -farmers. So, if four out of the 14 selected 
households do not farm, the remaining list of 126 households would be split into 4 parts, and every 26
th household (because 126 divided by 4 is approximately 26) would be chosen, again 
starting from a random part of the roster.  This procedure was repeated until 14 farming 
households were chosen.  Then an additional six households were chosen using the same 
procedure as alternates in case the village leader had provided incorrect information,  or the 
household was not available.  To ensure that the procedure was followed properly by the 
enumeration team, the overall lead at CDRI checked the sample on a daily basis and supervisors 
conducting the randomization were required to take pictures of the rosters, so that the procedures 
could be replicated and chec ked. 
5.6 Assignment of Treatment in ASPIRE  
As described above, treatment assignment was done within each CEW cluster.  Within each 
cluster, one village was assigned to either the basic model, the enhanced model, the enhanced plus model, or the control.  As a r esult, there are 10 villages within each model in Battambang, 
and 8 villages within each model in Pursat. Randomization into the treatment groups was done 
through a random number generator at the IFPRI offices . As the ICT treatment was being 
assigned at the village level, there were no concerns about  jealousies arising due to treatment 
status within villages.  
5.7 Data Collection  
Data collection was performed by the Cambodian Development Research Institute (CDRI) at  
baseline and endline for both  pilot projects.  CDRI translated survey instruments and provided 
input from a Cambodian perspective.  But the research team at IFPRI was mainly  responsible for 
the survey design and implementation plan.  Before each survey round, CDRI in collaboration 
with IFPRI conducted a week -long enumerator training , followed by a pilot of the survey where 
the enumerators were further evaluated on their interviewing skills . The team of enumerators and 
field supervisors to participate in the survey activities that were selected based on a competitive 
and rigorous evaluation process during the training of the field team.   Interviewers were both 
chosen on ability to ask questions in a neutral, similar manner, and on experience.  
In each round of data collection, the field team was comprised of eight teams, which included 
one superv isor and five enumerators. Supervisors back -checked the data collected by 
households, and during the data entry process households were called by phone to clarify any 
discrepancies in the data. Households were not compensated for their participation in the survey, 22 but refusal rates were extremely low.6 The four surveys were collected as in Table 4, and in both 
cases enumerators made efforts to visit exactly the same households.  Attrition rates, therefore, 
were 5.2 percent  for PADEE and 2.4 percent  for ASPIRE.7  We discuss whether treatment was a 
determinant of attrition in Section 8.

5.8 Sample Size Determination  
In our original proposal, our sample size calculations included 4 treatments and a control group, 
which led to a sample of 3000 households. As we negotiated to work on PADEE and ASPIRE separately on the request of MAFF, we had to determine separate sample sizes for studying the 
ePADEE intervention and the VOTO mobile direct calls.  Our sample size s for the two 
interventions were basically determined by three factors: 1) the overall budget availability, 2) the availability of farmer groups and/or communities  in which to conduct the surveys, and 3) power 
calculations that informed whether we could reasonably detect impacts.   
For the ePADEE pilot, we were somewhat constrained by the number of farmers that each 
MST could reasonably work with at maximum within a farmer group, as well as statistical power.  
A rule of thumb in considering statistical power among continuous variables is that there is very little to gain with sample sizes beyond 20 observations within a primary sampling unit, and 20 farmers per group was an absolute maximum with whom MSTs were willing to work.  As 
mentioned above, after  dismissing villages and corresponding MSTs that had experience with 
ePADEE in its earlier phase, we were left with 62 possible MSTs; hence, we settled on a balanced 
sample of 60 MSTs (20 in each treatment arm).  
Since we know the attrition rate (5.2%), we can provide here an ex post  consideration of 
statistical power for both general discrete and standard normal continuous variables within our 
sample.  The minimum detect able effect for a discrete variable with a baseline level of 10 percent 
(for example, a knowledge variable) is 0.112, or 11.2 percentage points.
8  Minimum detectable 
effects increase as the baseline level increase, to 18.4 percentage points at a 40 percent  baseline 
                                                
6 Note that neither John Henry nor Hawthorne effects should play a role in affecting our results; the control group 
farmers should not have been aware they were in a control group and were receiving generally project benefits anyway, 
while Hawthorne effects should be balanced between the tr eatment and control groups.  
7 After observing the attrition rate for PADEE, IFPRI worked with CDRI specifically  on improving their tracking 
procedures for data collection in the ASPIRE endline. However, as we will discuss later in the report, much of the 
attrition came from one province, Pray Veng , and that attrition was due to migration to Phnom Penh, which is adjacent . 
8 We continue to assume an intracluster correlation of 0.1.  23 level.  For a standardized normal, the sample can detect a change of 0.37 standard deviations 
with no controls and 0.33 standard deviations if 20 percent of variation can be explained with 
controls.

For the ASPIRE intervention, we were particularly interested in understanding whether 
interactions could be measured between farmer group and non -farmer group members. We 
focused on determining a sample that both stayed within the remaining fieldwork budget and 
optimally split the sample between farmer group and non- farmer group members.  We considered 
a number of different scenarios, largely from the perspective of rice yi elds and total value of 
production, in terms of different treatments (variants of the models that we used) and in terms of the split between farmer group and non- farmer group members. As noted earlier in the report, the 
idea was to ensure that a large enough sample of non- farmer group members might receive 
information from farmer group members; however, all of the non- farmer group members in all 
three treatments ended up receiving calls. Ensuring that treatment effects would be detectable 
under a reasonable amount of spillovers was our primary goal in developing the sample.  
We used simulations to determine that under our budget constraint and feasibility constraints, 
the sample we chose from among a number of different options  (3 treatments plus a control , with 
one calling non -members ; 72 villages with 10 farmer group members and 14 non- members).  We 
find that an increase in rice yields may be plausible to detect  at around 15 percent for a direct 
effect and 20 percent for a plausible indirect effect , while a change in the value of output will be 
far more difficult to detect (Figures 7 and 8).

ePADEE pilot, due to the three treatments rather than two. Minimum detectable effects, 
particularly with some explained variance, are somewhat lower w ith some explained variation, 
which should be easily possible with CEW fixed effects.

6 Programme or policy: Design, methods and implementation 
The PADEE and ASPIRE programs themselves were originally designed by the International 
Fund for Agricultural Development in collaboration with MAFF. The development of  the two 
extension innovations were developed in different contexts, which we describe again briefly 
below.  We then explain delivery in each context and describe exposure as it was supposed to 
occur, and then we provide details on what actually occurred.  
6.1 ePADEE Design  
The ePADEE program had been designed by a consortium of MAFF, SNV, iDE, and Grameen 
Intel during the PADEE project and while our contract was being negotiated. Since it covered or was planned to cover much of, but not all, of the technology use desc ribed in our proposal, it was 
an obvious choice to test in a more rigorous manner.  ePADEE consisted of three apps at the time, one of which used a soil test to make seed recommendations  (and seeding methodology) , 
a second app that used the soil test resul ts to make fertilizer recommendations and use 
recommendations, and a third app that made recommendations about how to deal with specific 
pests and/or weeds.
9  The software was originally designed in Bangladesh but has been adopted 
to several different countries. 
ePADEE was first used by farmer groups supported by SNV in PADEE as well as some of the 
business activities that were started and supported by iDE. The implementation of initial ePADEE 
activities involved 97 MSTs, but each worked with only a handful  (around 7) farmers. Initial 
activities were heavily supported and monitored by a team from the GDA, which made regular 
field visits to MSTs. Monitoring in initial activities took place centrally through the Grameen 
                                                
9 A fourth app related to market information was also developed but not used i n Cambodia; since the pilot project the 
four apps have been combined into one app and Lors Thmey has worked with Grameen Intel to develop a vegetable 
app as vegetables are a more lucrative crop for their business -oriented clients.  26 software, which registered which farmers  had received recommendations from the software, at 
least for seed and fertilizer. Their monitoring indicated that the pests and weeds application was 
not used as frequently as the other apps.  
In the pilot project here, t he idea was for MSTs to work with 20 specific farmers from a farmer 
group with the app; we suggested one soil test for each group of ten farmers, to trade off some precision in requirements for cost of conducting the tests. As discussed in the randomization 
section, MSTs who were randomly s elected for our ePADEE pilot were brought to Phnom Pen h 
for a refresher training; the training reminded MSTs how to use the three apps, took them through 
practice, and placed emphasis on the app that had not been used as much in the initial activities. 
The training was conducted by Grameen Intel staff with support from IFPRI and a translator.  
During the training, schedules for visits were discussed and worked out. The schedule is linked 
to the payment schedule for the MSTs in the ICT Plus group as well; wit h those MSTs, the amount 
and form of paym ent of per diems was discussed collaboratively. MSTs in the ICT Plus groups 
felt that it was fair to reduce per diems for visits by approximately 10%, and the amount that they earned from incentive payments could be paid in a lump sum at the end of the project.  The 
following schedule was therefore worked out collaboratively:  
Each MST was to visit each group five times, and a visit could take multiple days, as extension 
visits will be done in 2 groups of 10 farmers f rom a list of farmers surveyed in the village. The 
visits would include the following components:  
Visit 1 . During seed selection and planting period. During this visits the MST’s will use the seed 
selection module of the tablets to advise their farmer group. In addition, MST’s will perform a 
soil test  and provide an initial fertilizer recommendation . 
Visit  2: Visit before first fertilizer application to remind farmers  about the fertilizer 
recommendation, and  identify  any further  information and inputs needs.  
Visit 3 : Visit before second fertilizer application to remind farmers of the second fertilizer 
recommendation and check for pests using the pest module  of the software.  
Visit 4 : Visit before third fertilizer application and check for pests . 
Visit 5 . Before harvesting to check for pests and identify post -harvest needs.  
Payments of per diem, which took place through the mobile money system called Wing, would 
take place in three blocks :  
Initial payments for visits 1 and 2  
 Month 1 - Set up an initial payment to support  travel for first visits  
• ICT: Base pay  
• ICT Plus: 90% of base pay  
 Month 2 
• ICT: Base pay  
• ICT Plus: 90% of base pay  27 Second payment  for visits 3 and 4   
 Month 3/4 
• ICT: Base pay  
• ICT Plus: 90% of base pay  
Third for last v isit and incentives  
 Month 4/5 
• ICT: Base pay  
• ICT Plus: Base pay + Incentive based on average score of the 
farmer groups during the season.  
There were two main deviations from an “ideal” protocol, though the first we do not fully consider 
a deviation.  First , the GDA wanted to be involved in monitoring the pilot project. However, they 
had no allocated budget to pay for it, and PADEE was running over -budget in either case. We 
attempted to help MAFF and the GDA fundraise to help support our pilot, but the fundi ng fell 
through. So, the GDA was not able to monitor the activities; however, their monitoring would have 
just added cost to an activity that was already somewhat costly per beneficiary, as we will discuss in the cost  effectiveness section. In other words,  the implementation of incentives here becomes 
more important from a monitoring perspective. The second deviation was that a few villages did 
not plant rice during the late season, but rather during the initial season in the following year. We 
had to adjus t procedures for those few villages and conducted tests later for farmers (and ensured 
later payments for farmers).  
6.2 VOTO Mobile Messaging in ASPIRE  
As discussed above, in ASPIRE we tested sending direct, basic messages to farmers. Messages were developed by IFPRI and MAFF’s extension unit, who used the Grameen Intel software as a guide for development for the rice crop, and extension manuals for long beans, cucumbers, and 
chickens as a guide for the messages for vegetables and chicken rearing, respectively. Initial 
drafts of messages were written by an IFPRI consultant, and then there was substantial dialogue 
between IFPRI and MAFF to get the content and the length of each message right.  It was decided that messages should be between one and two mi nutes long, so they did not lose the subject’s 
attention. Initial drafts of messages were in English but were quickly translated into Khmer.  
Messages were recorded professionally by VOTO Mobile in a neutral accent. Initial messages 
were to be delivered between 6 and 7 AM: if no one answered then three more attempts were made during the day by the automated system.  Phone numbers were collected as part of the baseline survey, so households without phones or who changed numbers were necessarily 
excluded from the sample.
10   
To determine which messages to send, the following procedure was followed.  Soon after the 
baseline survey was conducted and phone numbers wer e compiled, a text message was sent to 
                                                
10 We were concerned about  this problem  early in the planning for this pilot, as anecdotally farmers often change 
numbers to obtain better deals or lower rates. To deal with the problem, enumerators were instructed to call numbers 
and then the initial offers or text messages were s ent out soon after the baseline survey was complete.  28 all phone numbers that were collected within the treatment groups; these included phone numbers 
from the farmer groups (10 times 54, or 540 maximum); phone numbers from farmers outside the 
farmer groups (14 times 54, or 756 maximum); and phone numbers from the remainder of the list 
of 50 phone numbers collected for the enhanced plus group (36 times 18, or 648 total).11  So a 
total of 1944 phone numbers were potentially collected for the phone messages. Of those, we 
found that 1141 of them were functional  by the second rice call , or 59 percent.12 
We followed the following procedure to determine the type of messages delivered to farmers. 
First, we sent text messages asking farmers t o sign up for the type of messages that they wanted. 
Second, we checked the list of topics that farmer groups had requested following, and we then 
ensured that those messages were sent to farmer group and non- farmer group members from 
each village.  So, for example, if a village had received extension on rice and chickens, all farmers who did not specifically request types of messages through the text message received rice and 
chicken messages. Messages were then sent on the following schedule to basic and enhanced message groups, respectively:

successfully answered; whether each call was completed, and whether calls were simply not 
answered or not were all recorded. Although there was a plan to reduce lists after week 3, so 
many calls were successfully completed, we continued to make calls to all working numbers 
instead of reducing the num ber of calls slightly.  
                                                
11 The 14 non-farmer group members were always a subset of the 50 farmers with phone numbers collected from the 
village head within the 18 enhanced plus villages.  
12 We made calls to a total of 1108 farmer s for rice, 602 farmers for vegetables, and 500 farmers for chicken.  The 
initial rice call went to 1197 numbers but we were able to ascertain that 89 of those numbers were no longer being 
used.  29 6.3 Monitoring Results, ePADEE  
Here, we focus on the monitoring results for the ICT Plus group, as data from Grameen Intel 
broadly suggest that the intervention was generally successful in signing up farmers; 620 of the 
800 possible farm ers signed up according to monitoring data. We also obtained access to 
PADEE’s monitoring information system (MIS), which was well designed, and we were able to 
match about 65 percent of households in our sample to the MIS.  Whereas there were supposed 
to be some useful variables in the MIS, including an approximate land area for each household, 
a subjective poverty measure, and a literacy measure, we wanted to use those variables to either 
corroborate or refute information in our sample. However, the most interesting finding is that the 
information that is supposed to be in the MIS (rice production and land area, in particular) is not 
there for most farmers - in fact, we found zeroes.  Clearly, the MIS is not useful for monitoring the 
project’s progress if data are not being entered.  
Within the ICT- Plus group, we collected short surveys among farmers in each of the villages 
where the 19 MSTs in the ICT- Plus group worked.13 We randomly sampled six farmers in each 
of these villages and performed bimonthly phone interviews (N=114). Farmers were interviewed about their MST’s frequency of visits, the advice they had received, and the new practices / techniques they had learned f rom the program. Based on the responses of farmers in each village, 
we can assess each MST’s performance and determine their bonus payments.  
We collected phone interviews in August, October, and December 2016. In each of these 
surveys we asked participant  farmers whether their assigned MST had visited them and the 
number of visits they received. Each survey also asked farmers about the particular types of 
advice they should have received from the MSTs based on the timing of the project. In each 
survey, fir st we determine whether MSTs had visited farmers. We interviewed six farmers in each 
of the villages assigned to the MSTs. Out of these six farmers, at least four (in the first phone 
survey) or three (in the second and third phone surveys) of them should h ave received at least 
one visit for the MST to be eligible to receive bonus payments. Those who did not meet this 
threshold did not receive any bonus payments. Among the MSTs who met the threshold, their payments were determined by farmers’ answers to seven questions related to the practices the MST is supposed to explain. As previously explained, these questions varied between surveys 
based on farmers’ cropping cycle and the stage of the project.  
MSTs should have visited farmers in the villages where they  were assigned to work to be 
eligible for any bonus payments. Figure 9 shows that during the initial months of the interventions, 
MSTs had a high rate of visits to farmers in their areas. In 18 (out of 19) of the villages covered 
by the ICT -Plus interventi on, the MSTs visited (at least once) all six farmers selected to participate 
in our first phone survey. However, there is a considerable reduction in the number of farmers 
that reported any subsequent visits by the MSTs: only 39% and 21% of the MSTs paid any visits to at least four farmers (out of six) in their villages in the second and third rounds of the phone 
survey, respectively.  
                                                
13 One MST worked with two farmer groups.  30 Figure 9. Distribution of Visits by Round of Phone Survey  
 
 
The reduction in the number of visits is likely to be related to the contents of the training. During 
the first few months, MSTs were mostly focused on collecting and testing soil samples among 
farmers. The results of those tests determine the plots’ level s of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, 
pH, and organic carbon. With this input, the MSTs provided farmers with advice on fertilizer application and crop pests / diseases in later stages of the program.  
Arguably, during the first months, MSTs’ duties were m ostly based on tangible and salient 
actions (i.e., soil sampling) that were required for later stages of the intervention. This might have 
encouraged visits to a larger number of farmers. In the following stages, MSTs were supposed to 
provide farmers with advice regarding fertilizer application and pest control. The reduction in the 
number of farmers they visited might be related to the somewhat less concrete actions in these 
stages. The reduction in the number of visits might also be related to the initial  novelty of the new 
technology being introduced and the bonus payments, which might have waned over time.  
Only MSTs that visited a minimum number of farmers were eligible to receive any bonus 
payments. For the first round of phone surveys, only MSTs that visited at least four (out of six 
farmers in their villages that participated in our survey) farmers were eligible to receive any bonus 
payments. Due to the reduction in the number of visits, this threshold was reduced for the second 
and third rounds: MSTs  would be eligible for bonus payments if at least three of the farmers from 
their villages that participated in the survey reported any visits. The overall level of bonuses for 
all MSTs were lower than they would have been had they been receiving the full per diem, 
suggesting that the bonus was not large enough to induce the expected behaviour ( Figure 10). 
  
31 Figure 10. Bonus Payments in PADEE , by Round 
 
In sum, we find that the MSTs in the ICT Plus group appeared to start the project with vigour , 
but then they did not follow through to continue to visit the communities at the same rates.  There 
are two potential implications. First, it could be that the bonuses w ere not large enough to catalyse 
action.  If so, then MSTs simply did not find the incentive large enough to continue to do this part 
of their job without any further monitoring.  One concern that some MSTs expressed in 
interviewing them was that we asked them to work with “too many” farmers; they may have simply 
perceived the work as too difficult.  Second, it could be that the monitoring and/or assistance that 
they normally expect from the GDA is truly essential.  If so, then the grant we could not obtain  
would have been essential to make the ePADEE program “work;” however, as we discuss in the cost analysis sub- section, this type of extension was already quite costly on a per beneficiary 
basis.  
6.4 VOTO Mobile Monitoring Results  
To carry out the phone calls, the following schedule was developed (as shown above).  The basic 
calls group all received three weekly messages on rice in September.  The enhanced calls groups 
received the basic calls, and they received reminder calls throughout October and are receiving 
one call in November and December, respectively.  For chicken rearing, the basic calls group 
received four calls in September and October; the enhanced calls groups received reminders 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100%

messages began in the second half of October ; the basic messages group received  three 
messages in October and the first week of November, and reminders t ook place through 
December for the enhanced messages groups.  
In general, the calls were quite successful. We find that for chicken messages, between 50 and 
70 percent of farmers tend to listen to the message, whereas for rice, typically between 55 to 70 
percent of farmers listen to the entire message  (Figures 11 and 12). These numbers ar e even 
higher when we only consider farmers who requested a specific type of messages; we find that 
around two- thirds of farmers listen to rice messages, and up to 78 percent of farmers listened to 
chicken messages. Notably, the proportion of farmers who are listening to messages does not 
appear to decrease over time, as we would expect if farmers did not like receiving them. Even 
messages that were provided a few weeks after the main set of messages, which occurred in November and December, had quite high listening rates.

Calls related to long beans and cucumbers began in the third week of October, to coincide 
with the timing of cultivation ( Figures 13  and 14 ).  Estimated rates of listening to calls are typically 
over 60% for both crops and are close to 80% in some cases. Further, they do not decline over  
time, suggesting again that the basic messages  are useful to farmers.  In the future, we can fill in 
information on the proportion of farmers who had grown long beans or cucumbers in the past.

If anything, spot check calls to participants suggested that they wanted either more calls or 
the ability to repeat calls.  The spot checks took place in October , and November, and gave us 
confidence that the calls had been effective at reaching farmers.  The main complaint from farmers 
was that there was no way to repeat messages.  
In sum, the monitoring data suggest that the calls were quite popular and effective in reaching 
at least a portion of farmers; we note that farmers who did change numbers were not able to 
receive calls.  Since VOTO (now Viamo) mobile is currently working on a call -in service, a main 
question in our minds is whether direct calling or on- demand phone trees are more effective at 
providing advice to farmers at this time.

Basic Messages Enhanced Messages Enhanced Messages Plus36 7 Impact Analysis and Main Results  
In this section, we provide our main analysis, following the pre- analysis plan that appears in 
Appendix B.  We follow the same format as the report to this point, sequentially discussing the 
PADEE pilot project and then the ASPIRE pilot project.  
7.1 PADEE Analysi s Plan  
In analyzing results for the ePADEE pilot, we want to compare the ICT (T1) and ICT Plus (T2) 
treatments with a control group.  With the presence of baseline data, our main specification is an 
ANCOVA:  
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖1=𝛼𝛼+𝛽𝛽1𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖1+𝛽𝛽2𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖2+𝛾𝛾𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖0+𝝉𝝉𝑿𝑿𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊+𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   (1) 
where i indexes households, v indexes villages, 1 denotes variables that are collected at endline, and 0 variables collected at baseline. The variables included in the main estimating equation 
include Y (an outcome), a vector X  (potentially important explanatory variables, collected at 
baseline), and an error term assumed to be clustered at the village or farmer group level.  
The first set of variables that we use test for whether the two treatments were basically effective 
or not.  We ask farmers whether they know the MST’s name or phone number; the frequency of 
advice received over the past 12 months, whether the MST who visi ted had a tablet or not, and 
whether subjectively farmers thought that the tablet helped the MST give better advice.  
Next, we examine the basic relationship between the two treatments and farmer knowledge 
about messages they should have learned related to rice production. Given that we focus on rice 
production, farmers’  knowledge variables that are included in analysis are the ideal number of 
times to apply fertilizer during the wet season; the number of days to wait for the first fertilizer 
application af ter rice seeds are sown, the number of rice diseases the respondent c laims they can  
identify out of 10; and the number of diseases they correctly identify out of 10. Finally, we look at standardized effects across the 10 diseases using the Kling et al (2007) normalization procedure 
for classes of outcomes.  
The following set of regressions relate to the production process.  We measure whether or not 
farmers realize that plots have any types of deficiencies, which should have been identified as 
part of the eP ADEE procedure. We then test whether improved inputs were used in production, 
and examine potential impacts on rice yields and overall agricultural income.  
7.2 ASPIRE Analysis Plan  
In analyzing results for the ASPIRE pilot, we want to compare the basic calls ( T1), the enhanced 
calls (T2), the enhanced calls plus (T3), with a “business as usual” control group. Recall that an 
important difference between the PADEE and ASPIRE pilots is that we were able to  stratify at the 
CEW level in the ASPIRE sample.  So the basic ANCOVA equation we estimate is:  
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖1=𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖+𝛽𝛽1𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖1+𝛽𝛽2𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖2+𝛽𝛽3𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖3+𝛾𝛾𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖0+𝝉𝝉𝑿𝑿𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊𝒊+𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖  (2) 37 where i indexes households, v indexes villages, c indexes CEWs, 1 denotes variables that are 
collected at endline, and 0 variables collected at baseline. The variables included in the main 
estimating equation, in addition to the treatment variables, include Y (an outcome), a vector X 
(potentially important explanatory variables, collected at baseline), and an error term assumed to 
be clustered at the village or farmer group level.  
We estimate an alternative version of equation (2) for selected outcomes to t est for differences 
between the farmer group and non -farmer group members. We use the non -farmer group 
members of the control group as a base, since they should have the least contact with ASPIRE, and then we estimate:

where G represents farmer group membership, NG represents non- farmer group members, and 
C represen ts the control group. All regressions at this point are reported as intent -to-treat effects, 
though some are presented as conditional on the existence of a reported value; those variables 
will be pointed out in the discussion.  
We use both equations (2) and (3)  to estimate impacts on  variables measuring knowledge of the 
program, the presence  of social  informati on flows within the village, and experience with ASPIRE 
and the CEWs, as well as basic knowledge about rice, chicken rearing, and cucu mber and long 
bean production. We then use equation (2) to estimate impacts on  different types of input use.  
Finally, we use equation (2) to estimate impacts on the production process.  We measure whether improved inputs were used in production, expenditures on inputs, and then we examine potential 
impacts on rice yields and overall agricultural income.  
7.3 Balance Tables  
7.3.1  PADEE Sample Balance  
We first present baseline values of all variables that appear in the analysis  by treatment status 
(Table 8).14 Prior to the intervention, only 35 percent of control group households knew the MST, 
but those who did know the MST appeared to get advice often , as the average across the whole 
sample was 2.5 times per farmer over 12 months. Still these differences are not statistically significant across groups.  
However, we do find differences in fertilizer use across groups . The ICT group appears to be 
more  likely to have used NPK in rice cultivation; however, use rates in general are high, so the 
difference is not terribly meaningful. That said, the ICT and ICT Plus groups both have more 
experience using pesticides in rice cultivation in the past 12 months than the control group, which 
may mean they are less likely to increase pesticide use further.  
                                                
14 No imputation has been completed for missing variables.  However, we have used prevailing local prices to value 
agricultural products that were not sold.  38 Quantities of both NPK and urea reported used by the ICT group are also higher than the other 
two groups. However, all of the averages appear to be relatively hi gh, considering 100 kg/ha as 
a benchmark. Given the higher fertilizer application rates, it is not surprising that the ICT group 
has higher expenditures than the other two groups; however, yields are no different between the 
three groups.  
As a result of the baseline differences between the ICT group and the other two groups, we may 
want to consider implications of these differences after presenting results.  We return to these 
differences in section 8.

 39 7.3.2  ASPIRE Sample Balance  
We next examine balance among the ASPIRE sample. To do so, we generally estimate the 
following equation using the baseline sample:  
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖1=𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖+𝛽𝛽1𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖1+𝛽𝛽2𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖2+𝛽𝛽3𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖3+𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   (4) 
So we are looking for rejections of the null hypothesis that 𝛽𝛽𝑗𝑗=0, for j=1,2, and 3.  
First, we examine variables that measure awareness of ASPIRE ( Table 9).  We find that the 
awareness of ASPIRE is not high, bu t that might not be surprising as only 42 percent of the sample 
should be in ASPIRE farmer groups.  Only 32 percent had been visited by a CEW and very few 
knew the phone number of the CEW; there are no differences in means between groups.

In Table 10, we examine variables measuring which crops  were  cultivated by households.  We 
find differences significant at the 10 percent level between the basic messages group and the 
control, for rice production and rice cultivation in the wet season.  Coefficients are generally negative for the treatment groups on vegetable and all other crop production, respectively, but they are not significantly different from zero. Somewhat surprisingly, a relatively large share (20 percent) of the sample do not cultivate rice at all .

Next, we examine conditional means for variables that relate to crop production ( Table 11).15 
Whereas coefficients may appear large, differences are not significant in most cases, because of 
wide distributions on variables.  Moreover, most of the coefficients are within a reasonably small 
percentage of the control group mean.  A mong these variables, an unbalanced sample does not 
appear to be much of a concern.

Finally, we provide information on rice yields and total agricultural income and expenditures on 
rice (Table 12).  Some of the larger differences , in terms of magnitude, found in Table 11 appear 
                                                
15 For brevity, we report rice as either wet season or total rice production, omitting dry season production; 
only 10 per cent of households grew dry season rice at baseline.  41 due to differences in land holdings, as rice yield differences from the control group mean are all 
within 10 percent, and are not significantly different from zero. Similarly, the value of production 
per hectare of rice and total income are not statistically different from the control group.  As with 
the previous table, none of the differences are statistically different from zero.

sample.   
7.4 PADEE Impact Analysis  
In this sub -section, we initially present quantitative analysis that closely follow s the pre -analysis 
plan to estimate impacts of the ICT and ICT Plus treatments.  The quantitative analysis is followed 
by some of the qualitative insights, and then we briefly summarize the findings.  
7.4.1  Quantitative Analysis  
First, we examine outcomes related t o knowledge of the program ( Table 13).16 We find that the 
ICT and ICT Plus groups  are more likely than the control group to report that either the respondent 
knows the MST or that the MST they know visited the village in the past twelve months.  However, 
the magnitude of the coefficients in each case is perhaps lower than one would have expected.  The former coefficients suggest the households are only 8 percentage points more likely to know the MST’s name and phone number than the control group. Whereas they are between 27 and 
29 percent more likely to report that the MST visited the village in the past 12 months.  Farmers 
in the treatment groups are also much more likely to report having received advice from the MST 
in the past 12 months, at between 0.72 and 0.81 times, on average. However, each of these 
                                                
16 At present, all regressions only include regional fixed effects and do not include baseline control variables.  42 suggests 1.5 visits relative to the control group on average, which is far below the 5 visits that 
were supposed to occur.

respectively. Controls include household head's age, gender, dummies for education level, asset index, and

As these outcomes are clearly related, it is worth further conducting multiple hypothesis testing 
on the set of outcomes in Table 13. To do so, we use the resampling method of Westfall and 
Young (1993) as coded in Stata by Jones et al. (2018), with and without the set of baseline control 
variables, bootstrapping standard errors with 1000 replications.  We find that all ten outcomes 
have corrected p- values of 0.023 or lower, lending confidence that the estimates are statistically 
significant ( Table 14).

MSTs visiting the treatment groups were much more likely to have the tablet with them when 
they visited, and farmers were more likely to report that MSTs visiting had tablets and that they 
helped them give better advice.  The two treatment groups reported that the MSTs were between 
12 and 13 percentage points more likely to give better advice with the tablets; adding to the control group mean, these figures imply about 25 percent of treated farmers responded to this question 
in the affirmative (columns 4 and 5) . 
We next explore impacts on whether households received specific types of extension 
messages that should have been expected ( Table 15). The ten variables include disease 
prevention and treatment, improved rice varieties, seed recommendations, chemical fertilizer applications, co mposting and compost application (separately), water management, pest 
prevention, access to credit, and soil nutrient deficiencies.  We report these results only among 
rice producers.  For both groups, we find all the estimated coefficients are positive but vary 
substantially in magnitude.  The largest coefficients are on the soil nutrient deficiencies indicator; 
they suggest that 38 and 40 percent age points more rice farmers in the ICT and ICT plus groups, 
respectively, received extension on soil nutrient deficiencies than the control group, which only 
received such messages 8 percent of the time. Meanwhile, the least common message received 
over the control group related to water management; we find only 2.5 and 1 percentage point 
more farmers in the ICT and ICT plus groups received such messages, over 8 percent of the 
control group.

  45 As we again are estimating a number of hypotheses simultaneously, we present p -values 
corrected for multiple hypothesis testing for Table 15 in Table 16.  The p- values sugges t strong 
significance of the chemical fertilizer and soil nutrient messages for both treatment groups. These 
results are both consistent with the monitoring data, which s howed that the first visits definitely 
occurred and used the tablet based extension more often than not, at least in the ICT plus group. 
Somewhat surprisingly, the ICT group also received more extension on access to credit (the ICT 
plus result is significant as well at the 10 percent level).  This result is surprising only because it 
would have been a secondary outcome.

We aggregate the extension variables from Table 15 and Table 16 into two indices. First, we 
measure whether a rice farmer has received any extension at all, and then the number of 
extension messages they received in general ( Table 17 columns 1 and 2).17 We then split the 
sample by whether they report receiving extension from the government (column 3) or from 
PADEE (column 4), and finally measure the reported extension visits (column 5). We find positive 
and nominally statistically significant results for all variables; however, we do not find detectable 
differences betw een the two treatment groups. The latter finding suggests that the incentives were 
                                                
17 We drop the three services that were received by almost no one from estimation in Table 15. 46 not effective at increasing extension received by the treatment group. We further note that it is 
not a power issue, as the point estimates for the ICT group are generally higher than for the ICT 
plus group.

Point estimates suggest that both treatment groups became about 50 percent more likely to receive any extension, as about half the control group reported receiving at least one extension 
visit. They received about one more extension service than the control group, and the average 
farmer received an additional two visits, over both treatment groups.  As the latter result is not 
conditional, if we divide by the approximate share of farmers receiving any visits, we note that 
control farmers receiving visits re ceived roughly 4, whereas treatment farmers received about 5 
and a half on average.  Correcting for multiple hypothesis testing, the aggregate variables all 
appear significantly different from zero at any reasonable level of significance ( Table 18).

Recalling receiving extension messages does not necessarily mean that farmers adopt them.  
Next, we measure whether farmers adopted any of the 10 recommendations listed in Table 15. 
Not surprisingly, the point estimates  in Table 19 are generally smaller than those in Table 15 , and 
they remain positive in all cases.  The former result is sensible as farmers might be reticent to 
apply techniques that they do not fully understand. From the perspective of the e -PADEE 
intervention, perhaps the most interesting results are whether f armers applied seed or fertilizer 
recommendations (columns 3 through 5). We find that point estimates show a 5 to 6 percentage 
point increase in farmers following seed recommendations over the control group, and 11 to 13 
percent on chemical fertilizers.18     
  
                                                
18 The result regarding improved rice varieties is somewhat subtle.  The treatment effect represents the additional 
farmers who followed recommendations give n to them, rather than the farmers who used improved seed in general.  48 Table 19. Impacts on varieties of extension services adopted, ePADEE Intervention

  49 Checking the latter two results for multiple hypothesis testing, we cannot conclude either 
coefficient on seed recommendations is different than zero, but the chemical fertilizer variables 
are both significant from zero at better than the 1 percent level ( Table 20). Interestingly, in Table 
19 we find that the coefficient for “soil nutrient deficiencies” is largest in magnitude, though it is 
not entirely clear what farmers would have done other than apply additional compost or chemical fertilizer. The multiple hypothesis test also suggests significance of those coefficients, though not the ones on the credit variables that also suggested statistical significance in Table 19.

Next, we examine whether ePADEE caused farmers in the treatment groups to report giving 
or receiving more advice about farming to others ( Table 21).19  These questions ask about 
                                                
19 Since none of the null hypotheses are rejected in these regressions, we do not conduct multiple 
hypothesis testing as it will inflate p- values even further and will not change the result of the hypothesis 
test. We follow this logic throughout the remainder of the report.  50 whether farmers received or gave advice to other farmers, either within or outside their home 
village.  We find no evidence that the ICT or ICT Plus treatment ar ms affected these variables.

We next consider whether or not the ePADEE treatments affected knowledge related to fertilizer 
applications or the diseases that households could identify in rice, from pict ures that enumerators 
showed respondents ( Table 22).  We do not find any significant coefficients on the four variables 
tested, which are the ideal number of fertilizer applications on rice plots, the number of days after 
planting to wait before applying the first fertilizer, and the number of diseases the household 
claims to identify or correctly identifies out of ten. These results show that farmers do not appear to have learned much about the way to use fertilizer or the type of diseases that might afflict their crops.  Whereas the former is a little surprising, the latter might not be; if farmers did not express 
a need for help with rice diseases, they might not have learned that information from the MST.

To build on results in columns 3 and 4 of  Table 22, we further disaggregate the practices and 
diseases into indices that measure the ability to identify diseases, how to prevent and treat them, 
and whether farmers were affected by specific di seases ( Table 23).  Not surprisingly, we do not 
find significant impacts; in fact, we find two negative coefficients that are significant at the 10 
percent level for the ICT plus specification.  Note that we should not have expected significance 
in the final column unless farmers became able to retroactively assess diseased crops.

Following Kling et al. (2007), we report the standarized effect across 10 outcomes, corresponding to 1 0 diseases, 
using the seemingly -unrelated regression framework to account for covariance across estimates. Diseases include: 
bacterial blight, leaf streak, sheath brown rot, blast (leaf and collar), blast (neck and node), brown spot, rice rugged

Next we study, in a disaggregated manner, whether farmers are able to identify different types 
of soil deficiencies ( Table 24). These deficiencies would have been identified during the soil 
testing phase, after which specific seeds and fertilizers would have been rec ommended. We find 
that treatment group households are no more likely to both know whether any plot has a soil 
deficiency, can identify a plot with a soil deficiency, nor can they identify specific deficiencies any 
better than the control group.  To note, s ome of the deficiencies are not very common, likely due 
to the relatively high rates of NPK use identified earlier.20

in all regressions.  Controls include household head's age, gender, dummies for education level, asset index, and 
household non-agricultural income at baseline.  
We next examine whether or not treatment status affected the use of various inputs ( Table 
25).21 We find only one marginally significant coefficient, on the use of urea in rice cultivation. 
Although we do not perform a multiple hypothesis test here, given that it is one coefficient ou t of 
eight reported here one might think it is the expected rejection of the null.  Note tha t the discrete 
variables have relatively high mean values in general, as households tend to use these inputs in 
general.  Perhaps a more interesting question is if t hey changed their intensity of use.  
                                                
21 We do not include a variable for the use of improved seed because al l households at endline who grew 
rice used improved seed.  54 Table 25. Impacts of ePADEE on discrete variables related to input use, by treatment status

To address that question, we next examine the quantity and value of various types of fertilizer , 
on a per hectare basis ( Table 26). Note that these regressions are all conditional on already 
growing rice. We find no significant coefficients on either quantity or value of NPK, urea, or 
compost applied per hectare.  Given  the relatively high rates of MPK and urea application, a priori  
it is not clear whether recommendations should have been to increase or decrease fertilizer use, 
or to time it differently to attempt to maximize yields. Still, there is no obvious effect on use as the 
coefficients are all quite imprecisely estimated.

Finally, we examine the impacts on agricultural expenditures and rice yields ( Table 27).  Not 
surprisingly, we find that the ePADEE intervention neither appears to affect expenditures nor 
yields per hectare.  Point estimates for both groups are small relative to the control group mean 
and are not close to significant.  Given the previous results, it is not surprising that the ePADEE 
intervention appears not to have affected input expenditures or rice yields

In sum, it appears that the ePADEE intervention was effective in increasing the contact 
between MSTs and farmers. A notable share of farmers believe that the tablets helped MSTs give 
better advice.  This point came through in our qualitative work as well; w orking with the MSTs, 
farmers feel like they have learned a great deal.  However, in our qualitative work several farmers 
admitted that they still could not follow all the procedural steps given to them by the MSTs. There were two main reasons.  First, there was sometimes a lack of either water or availability of enough 
of a key input, such as Kali, one of the sometimes recommended fertilizers.
22  Second, farmers 
are not used to following such recommendations, so they might need more time to further 
experiment. Nonetheless, in the aggregate the intervention did not appear to change knowledge 
among farmers relative to the control group, and so lack of aggregate changes in input use not surprisingly do not  appear to have much effect on input use by farmers  or final outcomes .  
7.4.2  Qualitative Analysis  
Experience with Extension 
Our focus groups included a set of questions meant to stimulate discussion about farmers’ 
experience with extension. Prior to the ePADEE intervention, farmers reported that contact with agricultural extension workers has been irregular and minimal (even within PADEE).  Farmers 
state d that the district official comes  to their commune once a year for agricultural development 
                                                
22 Kali was not included in the quantitative work except as “other”.  57 planning.  If there is financial support , the official would then provide some extension services as 
well. However, farmers expressed that the content of any such extension they have received in 
the past from was very general and not terribly relevant.  For example, they mentioned general 
information being disseminated, such as how to apply inputs such as fertilizer and pesticides. 
However, they did not know exactly the types of inputs to apply, not anything about how to time 
the application of fertilizer to optimize its effectiveness. I n general, though farmers apply inputs, 
they do not necessarily know how to best apply them.  
Whereas farmers appear to know of more recently disseminated techniques to grow rice, they 
perceive that the effort to apply them is too high relative to the benefits.  As a result, they have 
not be gun to use such techniques. Rather, they are happy to continue following traditional 
practices, which minimizes the effort in cultivating rice. Weedin g (especially removing grasses)  
and newer water supervision techniques that are time consuming tend not to  be used.  
 With respect to e -PADEE, farmers appreciated their  tailored recommendations , which allowed 
them to know exactly what inputs to use and the amount of inputs required for  each unique case.  
Farmers that tried to precisely follow the recommendations stated their rice grew better than in 
previous years and perceived higher yields They also stated they  learned a great deal.  However, 
for two reasons many  farmers admitted that they could not follow all the procedural steps given 
to them by the MSTs.  First, there was sometimes a lack of either water or availability of enough 
of a key input, such as Kali, one of the recommended fertilizers. Second, farmers are not used to 
following such recommendations, so they might need more time to further experiment.  
 
Perhaps not surprisingly, farmers are uncertain about continuing to use these techniques once 
PADEE and e -PADEE are gone. While farmers  perceive that the s oil test was important, and they 
do not know where to get the soil testing service , and the groups made it relatively clear that 
farmers are not  committed to pay for such services. In terms of where to get advice, farmers did 
realize they can call their MS T, but not a single farmer in any focus group had ever placed a call 
to an MST.  As a result, at endline the enumerators for the ICT and ICT Plus villages were asked 
to read a short script at the end of the interview stating that the fertilizer recommendati ons they 
had received were still valid, and that they should feel free to call the MSTs for additional help.  
 
In general, farmers in the focus group discussions tended to split farmers in the village into two groups – the first group are farmers who work hard at farming, and so they are interested in 
learning and applying new technologies or techniques to try to make their lives better.  A second group of farmers are not as interested  in farming  and are perceived to  just try to farm just to grow 
enough food  and minimize effort.  These farmers, it was argued, simply do not care much in 
improving their livelihoods , though they may have other sources of income.  Targeting these 
projects might be instrumental to their success;  in our case, we relied fully on the targeted that 
was conducted earlier by MAFF.  
 
Finally, we were interested in whether farmers would trust people other than MSTs, who tend to be district agricultural officers. In determining that the  initial e-PADEE program would work with 
MSTs, SNV and MA FF had determined that Community Extension Workers (CEWs) would not 58 be trusted enough; however, M STs do not exist in ASPIRE, so any extension like e -PADEE would 
need to occur through CEWs.  Farmers in the focus group discussions stated that they were not 
concerned about who was teaching extension techniques, so long as the extension worker  has 
relevant skills and experience.  So long as CEWs or those they facilitate in conducting extension 
can convince farmers they have relevant skills, the absence of MSTs s hould not present a 
problem.  
 
Crop Decisions and Income  
In general, farmers want to grow both rice and cash crops. Cash crops are, according to farmers, 
a potential  source for supplemental income,  as they perceive the main source of income as rice 
producti on. So farmers perceive vegetables in particular as an attractive cash crop, for interesting 
reasons. The groups tended to suggest vegetables are attractive as  the growing period is shorter 
than for  rice, and therefore they receive income more quickly.  Moreover, they perceive that 
growing vegetables typically uses less labor than rice.    
 
That said, in some villages farmers have experimented with growing vegetables, but they have 
stopped for a few reasons.  First, some claim to lack enough water.  Second, vegetables have 
different diseases than rice, and farmers do not know how to deal with them when they come about.  Third, similarly farmers lack knowledge about how to deal with pests that attack 
vegetables.  As a consequence, vegetable production is not as lucrative as it could be.  
 
On the output side, farmers feel like it is easier to try to develop crops beyond rice if there is a 
formal network linking them to agricultural markets. Farm ers in places that are not so far from 
cities or provincial seats (around 10 km or below) have no problem selling livestock and 
vegetables.  However, the price is not guaranteed. On the other hand, farmers in villages farther 
from cities or provincial seat s have a major issue in trying to sell livestock or vegetables. Farmers 
in such villages state they do not want to grow more vegetables,  as there is no market.  So, they 
grow only a small amount for own consumption.  Some farmers can sell their products wi thin their 
village, but the market is very small.  
 
When conversations turned to discussing the best strategies for generating a household income, 
and whether or not that includes farming, most of the farmers stated that they thought that off -
farm work was  not for them.  Many of them had worked as unskilled labor migrants elsewhere for 
a time, but they did not find that the wages were providing attractive incomes.  However, this 
condition might be due to the timing of that migration, which often occurs amon g younger people; 
migrant opportunity appears to have increased within Cambodia. Also , migrant perspectives  were 
not represented in these discussions,  as they are not regularly present  in the village .  Rearing 
livestock is also an opportunity for supplemental income generation.  So long as chickens are for 
sale, farmers state that middlemen will come to collect them at the farm gate.  The problem is that 
most farmers do not have “technology” to raise chickens, and they sometimes do not  raise 
livestock in the closed household system.  
 59 Farmers who were present stated that so long as they have agricultural land and there is sufficient 
water, they prefer to stay put in their village.  A concern is whether there will continue to be enough 
water.  Moreover, they are concerned about the price of inputs, which might not be profitable to 
use given the marginal increase in production and prevailing prices for outputs.  
 
Phone Call Reactions  
Finally, we asked farmers to react to the phone call interviews that occurred in one of the treatment groups. Some farmers found the first call was a bit confused. It could be that interviewers were 
not used to asking questions by phone; most interviews are conducted with pen and paper in the households. However, farmers who received calls reported that after t he first call, they got used 
to answering questions in this manner, and the calls were relatively “normal.”  However, they did state there were problems recalling some of the information that was asked.  This problem might occur, of course, in a standard i nterview within the household as well.  
 
Software  
A further question of interest based on the MST interviews is whether the MSTs find e- PADEE 
useful in providing recommendations.  Recall that the e- PADEE software is predicated on initially 
conducting a soi l test. The MSTs interviewed acknowledged that the tool was quite effective at 
providing tailored recommendations to farmers, that it is fast and easy to use, as inputs just need 
to go into the apps and the recommendations come out. A challenge was that a very small 
proportion of farmers had already planted when recommendations came about, so they were 
unable to follow seed recommendations.  
A larger challenge for a handful of MSTs (no more than four) was that their tablets did not work very well; e.g. they would crash if on -line with the software open.  They had to use the e- PADEE 
apps offline, and then load the data to the server when connectivity improved. Another suggestion 
made by a few MSTs is that an additional meeting in the middle of the project woul d have been 
helpful to increase discussion about how people were using the software and could have helped 
with some of the ongoing problems. In ASPIRE, during 2017 it was planned that all CEWs would 
receive tablets with several different options for extens ion software; we recommended to the 
government that they set up Whatsapp groups for the CEWs to correspond with one another 
about potential problems, as communication across extension workers can be quite beneficial and the technologies already exist to fa cilitate that communication.  
7.5 PADEE Heterogeneity 
We complement the impact analysis of the complementary innovations implemented under 
PADEE with a heterogeneity analysis related to MST characteristics. We present the 
heterogeneity by estimating the difference in the impact estimates for farmers that share a given 
characteristic.  
First, we present heterogeneity across social connectedness , which we define as the MST 
knowing more than 10% of the farmers in the village before starting to work as an MST. Table 28 60 shows the estimated impacts among farmers  with high social connectedness . Among the ICT 
group, there are clear differences between impacts among those with low social connectedness 
and the higher social connectedness, as demonstrated by the significant coefficents on the 
interaction term between ICT group and MSTs with high connectedness. The incentive 
intervention may have manipulated this effect; we see fewer significant coefficients in the 
interaction term for the ICT plus group, while the basic coeffiicents remain significant as they were 
in the previous subsection. The exception is in column (4), as high social connectedness MSTs 
were  more likely, apparently, to bring their tablet as they visit.

Table 29 shows the impact estimates for extensions services received. These estimates differ 
from the previous table, as they show social connectedness mattering in both treatments.  
Estimates indicate  that farmers under high social connectedness MSTs are less likely to have 
received extension; although the main effect among both treatment groups remains positive. In 
additions, high social connectedness seems increase the impact estimates for receiving 61 extensions through the government or the PADEE program. The estimates suggest that a sense 
of familiarity between the MSTs and the village farmers decreases the likelihood of delivering 
services and that this was counterbalanced by the ICT and incentive sc heme that was tested.

We next disaggregate the impact estimates by incentives received.  MST s who received  incent ives 
above the median put more effort into implementing than those who received incentives below 
the median, so we effectively disaggregate the ICT plus group only . We find t he MSTs in the ICT 
plus group t hat received a larger incentive were the ones that farmers report were more likely to 
visit them, had the tablet with them and the farmers believes that the technology helped the MST 
give better advise (Table 30). While the differences in impacts between those above and below 
the median incentives at the end of the program are not large (statistically different), the estimates 
suggest the boost in ef fort among MSTs in the incentive group that is described in the theory of 
change.

Similarly, we estimate the impact disaggregating by this effort measure in Table 31, for the 
extension services received by farmers. Consistent with the what we observed before, M STs with 
above the median incentives generally have impact estimates of larger magnitude, though in this 
context the difference is not statistically significant. As a consequence of these two sets of tables, 
we observe that the incentives did have some effect; they broke any effects of social connectedness on visits undertaken by MSTs, and those who put in more effort appear to have 
also been more visible to farmers. However, that visibility was not enough to generate stronger 
impacts.

7.6 ASPIRE Main Impact Analysis 
In this sub- section, we follow the pre -analysis plan closely to estimate impacts of the basic 
message, enhanced message, and enhanced message plus treatments.   
7.6.1  Impacts on ASPIRE Knowledge and Receipt of Calls   
First, we examine outcomes related to knowledge of the program ( Table 32).23 We expect that 
households have no increased interact ion with the ASPIRE program, as the phone calls did not 
specifically promote any of ASPIRE.  We find that none of the treatment arms have a significant 
relationship with knowledge of ASPIRE. This result is not entirely surprising, since we do choose 
both A SPIRE group members and non -members in the same proportion in each treatment. Note 
that household membership of ASPIRE groups is lower than expected; it should be 42%, but the 
average is 35%. Only 16% of households have been visited by a CEW, though more have attended a meeting or training during the previous 12 months.  
  
                                                
23 At present, all regressions only include regional fixed effects and do not include baseline control variables.  64 Table 32. Impacts of Direct Calls on knowledge of ASPIRE Program, by treatment status

respectively. Baseline controls include household head's age, gender, whether the head is literate, and 
household's non -agricultural wage income.  
 
We next examine household experience with receiving phone calls related to rice ( Table 33), 
since almost all households that received phone calls received calls about rice. First, we ask if 
households ever received a call. We find that the basic treatment arm households are 7.7 
percentage points more likely to state they received calls than the control group, and the 
enhanced arm households are 12 to 15 percentage points more likely to receive calls. According to the schedule, basic message farmers should have received them in September; although their 
recall is not perfect, they are much more likely to report receiving messages in September than 
other months. Enhanced message farmers are more likely in all months to report receiving 
messages than the control group.  Finally, it is notable that households feel like the rice messages 
helped them inc rease production on the margin; 5.8 percentage points more farmers in the basic 
treatment arm and 10- 12 percentage points more farmers in the enhanced treatment arms 
answered that they felt the phone calls helped their rice production increase.

We find similar coefficients for impacts of the treatments on receipt of messages about chicken 
production ( Table 34). As with the rice messages, farmers in the enhanced message groups are 
twice as likely to repo rt ever receiving messages than the basic message groups, but both are far 
more likely to report receipt than the control group. Messages to the basic group went out in both 
September and October, and that is reflected in the coefficient estimates, though they are higher 
for each month among the enhanced message groups. Notably some farmers in all three groups 
report than the voice messages helped their chicken production; the difference is 4.8 percentage points for the basic message group and between 7.8 and 9.2 percentage points for the enhanced 
message groups.

Finally, we examine the impacts of the treatments on the receipt of calls about cucumber and 
long bean production ( Table 35).  Somewhat surprisingly, the coefficients are lower than those 
for chickens. Farmers have a harder time recalling in which m onths they received calls, and 
farmers are less likely to report that they ever received voice messages about cucumbers and 
long beans. Although literally true (recall, only 602 farmers in the treatment groups were 
targeted with vegetable messages, and not  all such farmers are in our sample), this finding is 
surprising relative to the chicken messages, since those were received by even fewer farmers.  Finally, the farmers suggest that the voice messages were not terribly helpful in increasing 
production, th ough the coefficients in the enhanced treatment arms for cucumbers suggest 
some of those farmers found the messages subjectively useful.

In sum, we find that farmers in the enhanced message groups were more likely to report that they had received calls than farmers in the basic message group, and they were more likely to report 
that the messages helped them increase production, at least in a subjective manner. However, it 
is worth discussing the magnitude of estimates.  Certainly, not all farmers should have been 
receiving calls, based on the set up of the experiment. However, we might have expected larger 68 coefficients on the “ever received”  variables than we find.  Some of the difference between what 
we might have expected from administrative data and what we found comes from the fact that we 
may not have interviewed the person who received messages; however, these treatment effects 
are quit e small. Second, it is worth mentioning there is some clear measurement error; the control 
group means should have all been zero, since we never gave any phone numbers from the control 
group to VOTO mobile. The subjective measures of production are nice; however, they are not 
necessarily positive for finding impacts in measured intent -to-treat effects unless those farmers 
reporting subjectively positive impacts had really large increases in production.   
7.6.2  Impacts withi n Social Networks  
A major goal of the pho ne calls was to provide additional information into the community about 
farming practices for rice, cucumbers, long beans, and chicken rearing, so they would spread into communities.  Hence, we next measure whether the direct calls affected any farmers gav e or 
received advice from others . Recall, some of the farmers in our data set did not receive messages, 
but they may have benefitted from farmers who did.  
We start by examining the impacts of treatments on whether farmers shared messages related to rice ( Table 36). We find that there appears to be an impact on sharing messages within villages, 
though the magnitude is small.  For the basic message group , the increase in sharing advice over 
the control group is 1.9 percentage points; it is between 3.8 and 5.7 percentage points for the enhanced groups. The changes among the enhanced groups leads to more sharing within the village; both of the enhanced groups suggest sharing advice with an average of 0.3 to 0.4 more 
people.  Sort of interestingly, the enhanced group has a larger magnitude coefficient than the 
enhanced plus group, which had a larger number of farmers overall receive calls.

The enhanced message treatments w ere more effective in creating networks around the rice 
messages that were received ( Table 37).  We next measure whether farmers knew someone who 
recei ved a message, the number of people known, whether techniques were learned from those 
who received messages and whether those techniques were again shared, and then the number 
of households with whom production improvements were discussed.  In the first th ree cases 
(columns 1- 3), the enhanced message treatments had positive impacts; these effects are not 
surprising, given that those treatments occurred more frequently and in the case of the enhanced message plus group, more farmers received the message.  If  farmers learned techniques second -
hand from the messages, only in the enhanced treatment plus do they appear to then share those techniques forward; the coefficient is quite small, however.

We next repeat the previous two tables  for chicken messages ( Table 38 and Table 39).  Just as 
with rice, the chicken messages appear to have stimulated some discussion within villages. Again, 
as with the rice messages, there is a small, significant coefficient in the basic message group on 
sharing advice; coefficients are larger for the enhanced message group. The coefficients suggest 
that an additional 0.2 people on average received advice within the enhanced treatment groups. Notably, there are also coefficients significan t at the 10 percent level for advice given outside the 
village.  For receipt of advice, we find small but significant coefficients on the number of people known who received messages and whether techniques were learned from others only in the enhanced call s plus group, suggesting that the additional saturation of chicken calls in those 
villages might have had an effect above the smaller number of calls received within other villages.

 72 Finally, we examine whether long bean or cucumber messages affected networks; given the small 
magnitude of coefficients on farmers recalling they received messages, this component seems 
unlikely.  In terms of sha ring from the messages, indeed we find only two weakly significant 
coefficients among the enhanced plus group (Table 40), in terms of whether messages were 
shared with others and the number of people with whom advice was shared.  We include estimates 
on receipt of advice on long beans or cucumbers in appendix tables (Tables C.2 and C.3).  The coefficients are small and largely not different from zero.

The implications of our findings are that the rice and chicken messages certainly catalyzed some 
conversation around the phone messages and limited sharing with farmers who did not receive the calls. The intensity of calls (e.g. the enhanced versus the bas ic messages) appears to have 
more of an impact on the amount of sharing than the saturation of calls within a community. In 
sum, though, we do find that the calls have impacts on the use of social networks for farming advice.  
7.6.3  Impacts on Knowledge of Practices  
We next use questions that were asked in the endline questionnaire to understand whether farmers learned about specific practices related to rice production, chicken rearing, and vegetable 73 production.  The questions were derived specifically from  the messages that were delivered; since 
we know that farmers in the enhanced groups were likely to have listened to more of the 
messages, we might expect larger coefficients among the enhanced treatment groups.  
First, we examine 16 variables related to ri ce production techniques .  The first set of variables 
relates to land and seed preparation ( Table 41). We do not find any significant coefficients on 
variables related to land or seed preparation, suggesting that farmers have not changed 
techniques or beliefs about how they would prepare land for planting in the future.

We next examine variables related to both weed removal and an initial set of variables related to 
fertilizer use for rice  (Table 42). In this context, we find two significant coefficients, both among 
the enhanced group; the enhanced group appears to become more likely to apply fertilizer to their 
rice fields.  Note that t he control group mean is much lower among these farmers than those from 
the PADEE sample, so there is more scope for improvement in fertilizer use among the farmers 
in this sample. The point estimate suggests that in the enhanced group the share of farmers  
applying fertilizer on rice increased by 12 percentage points. I t is somewhat curious that the 
enhanced plus treatment did not have the same effect as the enhanced group (4 percentage 
points, and it is not statistically different from zero) , given the lar ger saturation of calls in those 
villages.

Last in this category, we examine the impacts on two more variables related to fertilizer use,  
specifically urea,  and the use of pesticides ( Table 43). As with the previous variables, we find 
some si gnificant coefficients among the enhanced message treatment group, but no others.  The 
enhanced message group is 15 percentage points more likely, for example, to apply pesticides 
for rice cultivation, and they appear more likely to use protective gear when applying pesticides. Households in the enhanced group become 13 percentage points more likely to apply urea, and 
15 percentage points more likely to apply pesticides, over control means of 68 and 63 percent, 
respectively.  Coefficients for the other two g roups are not statistically different from zero. If 
anything, the enhanced messages appear to have improved knowledge of techniques, but 
surprisingly the same is not true among the enhanced plus group.

Next, we examine 17 practices related to chicken rearing that were covered in the chicken 
messages. Recall, only 500 households received messages, so we again might only expect to 
find significant coefficients among the treated groups. To ensure sample bal ance, for variables 
that are conditional we fill in zeroes where appropriate.  For example, if households did not face 
a disease outbreak, we code the “consulted vet” variable as zero.  
We begin by examining 5 variables related to disease prevention among c hickens ( Table 44).  
Note that we asked about the previous 12 months, which includes a few months before the 
messages were sent.  We examine whether or not chickens were vaccinated, whether the farmer 
faced a disease outbreak in the past twelve months, and then steps that were taken to deal with 
outbreaks in columns 3 through 5. We find no significant differences between treatment groups 
and the control group.  The sixth column examines a variable measuring whet her farmers reported 
spreading compost to grow or attract insects for chickens; we find a statistically significant and negative coefficient, but it is quite small (1.6 percentage points).

Next, we consider variables related to the way that chickens are kept, information about breeding 
cocks, and the number of eggs being generated by laying hens ( Table 45). We find negative 
coefficien ts for the enhanced treatment group only on the variable measuring whether or not rice 
husks or the like are used on the chicken house floor to reduce the spread of potential disease 
and to ease cleaning; very few households use this technique regardless o f the negative 
coefficient s.

Finally, we examine a set of variables that measures chick selection and feeding practices ( Table 
46). Once again, we find no significant differences between groups, with one exception which is 
only marginally significant.  So whereas there are some interesting coefficients related to rice 
practices , we find little related to chicken rearing.

We then  examine impacts on 10 variables related to vegetable production.   First, we examine 
variables related to seedling production, watering vegetables, and fertilizer ( Table 47). We find 
that the basic and enhanced plus treatment arms appear to have led to more seedling production,  
though the number of farmers underlying the treatment effects are fairly small. Other coefficeints 
are not significantly different from zero.

With the next set of variables, which are related to disease treatment or prevention, we again find 
only one significant coefficient, for not taking action at all to deal with a disease; again, it is not 
significant for the enhanced group, but is for the basic and the enhanced plus groups ( Table 48). 
Note here that the negative coefficient implies households became more active in dealing with 
diseases. However, again the coefficient is quite small in relative terms, so it may not reflect a 
large number of households changing behavior.

In sum, we find that the farmer knowledge base appears to have changed due to the phone calls, 
but the most meani ngful changes in knowledge or practices occurred with respect to rice 
production.  There are some suggestive changes for vegetable production, but they are likely too 
small in magnitude to place much stock in. We next turn to changes in input use.  
7.6.4  Impacts o n Input Use  
We focus on input use in rice production, as it is challenging to break out input use for chicken 
rearing and vegetable production.  First, we find that there were positive impacts of the enhanced 
treatment on improved seed, NPK, and pesticide use ( Table 49). These findings are consistent 
with findings from the previous set of  regressions for rice production, which also highlighted the 
enhanc ed group relative to the other two groups.  The treatment effect is somewhat small for 
improved seed, but reasonable (more than 7 percentage points) for NPK use, representing slightly 
more than a 10 percent increase over the control group.

There are also some significant findings, among the same group, on the intensive margin ( Table 
50). Specifically, we find that the enhanced group appears to put more NPK on their rice per 
hectare. The mean here among the control group is much lower than in the PADEE sample, so 
the additional fertilizer should be helpful in this range; the coefficient is suggestive of a 20 percent 
increase in NPK use.24 There are no significant effects for the other two groups on chemical 
fertilizer.  Both the basic and enhanced groups appear to have negative ef fects on compost usage 
but note that compost usage per hectare is quite low in the sample in general.

7.6.5  Impacts on Production  
We next examine impacts on total rice production ( Table 51). First, we examine whether 
households became more likely to grow rice, and whether their total harvest changed .  We find a 
small portion of the enhanced message group start cultivating rice (3.2 percentage points) , but 
there are no production impacts for any of the groups.  These results are consistent when we use 
the logarithm of yields as the dependent variable, shown in the appendix (Table C.6), or median 
regression, also in the appendix (Table C.7).

respectively. Baseline controls include household head's age, gender, whether the head is literate, and 
household's non-agricultural wage income.  
 
We next examine impacts on the total sales during the wet season, and the total value of rice 
production ( Table 52). We find positive coefficients on wet season sales, but no changes in 
production value, with the exception of negative coefficients in the basic message group that are 
marginally significant . Note that the sales are a small proportion of overall production for most 
households, and wet season production, which is the timing of this activity, accounts for most rice 
production in terms of value.25 
  
                                                
25 We include regressions of rice productivity on the treatment variables in Appendix Table C.5; again, we 
do not find significant results.  84 Table 52. Impacts of direct calls to ASPIRE groups on rice sales and total rice production,

Next, we look at the value of poultry production ( Table 53). We find households in the treatment 
groups are no more likely to have additional poultry varieties, to sell poultry, or to have additional 
production value or income from selling poul try, with the exception of the basic treatment group; 
however, this coefficient is marginally significant . These findings are relatively consistent with the 
previous results, which show that whereas some knowledge has increased production patterns 
may have not.

Next, we look at the value of vegetable production ( Table 54). As with the other two tables, we 
find no significant impacts on vegetable production.  Note that we might not be surprised by this 
result; we are aggregating far more than just cucumbers and long beans, and the intervention did 
not affect all households in the treatment groups.

respectively. Baseline controls include household head's age, gender, whether  the head is literate, and 
household's non-agricultural wage income.  
 
Finally, we examine the impacts on overall agricultural income on a per hectare basis ( Table 55).  
We find no significant coefficients for the basic and enhanced treatment groups; however, the 
enhanced plus treatment group demonstrates significant coefficients at the 10 percent level. T he 
magnitude on both would suggest an increase in net agricultural income of 15 percent above the control group, or around $83/hectare. However, none of the results leading up to this result are suggestive of impacts, nor do we find significant coefficient s in either appendix table which use 
logarithms or median regression.  So we are somewhat skeptical of this result suggesting average impacts over that group. We conclude that although there are some interesting effects on knowledge, knowledge sharing and fertilizer use, there do not appear to be any really robust 
impacts on productivity or net agricultural income.

7.7 ASPIRE Heterogeneity  Analysis  
To begin to explore heterogeneity, here we try to understand whether the experience of farmer 
group and non -farmer group members differed. We initially present the difference in the impact 
estimates for ASPIRE farmer group and the non-farmer group members.  We examine whether  
households reported receipt of messages at different rates, to help us infer among whom gains 
were attained.  For rice production messages , considering the interaction effects, we observe to 
significant differences between coefficients for farmer group me mbers and non- farmer group 
members  (Table 56). This result is quite sensible, as both should have received messages at 
approximately the same rate.

We find a slightly differernt  story for chicken messages  (Table 57). Whereas  impact  coefficients 
are positive for all treatment group s, the  farmers in the enhanced plus treatment group have 
higher magnitudes among ASPIRE farmer group members ; impact estimates double for the  
probability of  ever receiv ing a message . The base coefficient of 8.7 percentage points increases 
by 9.8 percentage point s among those in the ASPIRE farmer group. It could be that these 
messages were more salient among ASPIRE farmer group members because they are more 
likely to actually keep chickens than non- farmer group members.  Farmers in the ASPIRE group 
are much more li kely to report the messages helped increase their production; the basic 
coefficient is 4.6 percentage points and  increases by 10.6 percentage points for the ASPIRE 
group. This result implies  that farmer group members within that specific treatment group found 
these particular  messages more useful than non -farmer group members , again likely because 
farmer group members were more likely to raise chickens . 89 Table 57. Impacts of direct calls to ASPIRE groups on receipt of chicken messages , by 
treatment status interacted with ASPIRE group membership  status

We exam ine treatment interacted with group status for vegetable messages ( Table 58).  We find 
fewer significant effects and no significant differences within treatment groups for cucumber 
(panel A) and some primarily marginal statistically  significant differences among farm er groups 
for long beans  (panel B ). We find significant coefficients  among farmer group members  in the 
basic treatment arm , implying that farmer group members within this treatment group found the 
messages more useful than non- farmer group members ; other c oeffic ients are positive but not 
statistically significant .  Except for  rice messages, it seems that farmer group members found the 
messages more useful. A speculative rationale might be that some of these farmers are already 
trying to improve their farming , and that some of these groups actually chose to work on chicken 
or vegetable farming, so they are better placed to find additional information useful.

and knowledge sharing within these networks (panel B) for the rice messages (Table 59). The 
estimates do not suggest large  differences among farmer ASPIRE farmer group members . The 
enhanced group is more likely to share messages with other farmers in the village while the 
enhanced plus treatment group is more likely to know people in the village who received the 
messages; consistent with the research design increasing the availability of information in those villages by increasing the number of people who were sent messages.

We present similar tables for the same effects on chicken messaging in Table 60 , for cucumbers 
in Table 61, and long beans in Table 62. For these other products we do not find consistent 
evidence that farmers  that belong to the ASPIRE farmer groups are more likely to share the 
information received thorough the voice messages. In the estimates suggest higher probability of 
knowing farmers who received the messages among the farmers in the ASPIRE groups for 
chicken; these effects are smaller for the vegetables regression and not statistically significant at 
conventional levels .26

with depending on how far the villages were from population centers with 25, 000 and above. Those results 
did not suggest that relative isolation affected the probability to receive or share a message among farmers

7.8 Cost Ana lysis  
While neither intervention was successful at raising rice yields or agricultural incomes in the short 
term, it is worthwhile considering the average and marginal costs of each intervention, as an 
addition to an extension intervention such as the expanded ASPIRE.  It could also be that a variant 
of one of the two intervention models, as will be discussed in the next section, would act as a 
compliment to current extension activities within ASPIRE. Hence, we discuss the costs of 
implementing the two models on both an average basis and a marginal basis.  
The ePADEE intervention was supposed to serve 800 farmers. There are several  important 
cost categories borne by a project like ePADEE.  First, there are fixed costs; we assume that the 
MSTs (or CEWs in an ASPIRE- type model) already have access to a motorbike to get to villages, 
and in this context we were able to use tablets already owned by MAFF.  However, there is a 97 maintenance cost to ensuring that tablet software is kept up -to-date.27 The main costs f rom the 
implementation perspective are then soil testing for as many tests as take place, and all visits that 
take place by extension workers  to villages, which include per diems for travel  (accounting for fuel 
costs, etc.) . For the purposes of this estima tion, we will ignore any opportunity costs for farmers, 
in part because prevailing wage rates one can impute from the data either on or off the farm are 
relatively low and would add a small percentage to the overall costs.  
First, consider a model with no bonuses; each MST should visit their village 5 times at 2 to 3 
days per visit ; in our meeting with MSTs, they argued that soil testing took longer, so 14 days 
were needed.  We assume here we can cut to 12 visit -days per village. The prevailing per diem 
is $15/day; so each village requires $18 0 in what can be consi dered extension costs. We add $1 
per farmer for soil testing, and we used Wing, a mobile money service, to transfer money to MSTs 
in three installments.  Running a similar project alongside government (or with a private sector firm) would likely do the same, so we add $4.50 per village in costs ($1.50 per transfer).  Finally, 
we add costs of maintaining software and data costs of uploading; in Cambodia, such costs should 
not be more than $5 per MST.  In total, then, the cost per village, excluding any incentives  or 
training costs (even refresher training costs) , is around $209.50; this amount works out to about 
$10.48 per targeted farmer.  We can consider $10.48 a low estimate of the average cost per farmer.  
However, recall from our qualitative results that there were farmers within farmer groups who 
were not very interested in farming anymore; they were more interested in finding off -farm 
opportunities. If we very conservatively estimate that 25 percent of farmer group members are 
simply not interested in farming, any advice is effectively lost on them, and average costs rise to 
$13.97 per farmer.  If that percentage is higher, then average costs rise even further, since it is 
not necessarily observabl e to the project which farmers would be interested in such an 
intervention.   
Finally, let’s consider marginal costs.  In this case, as noted in our discussion MSTs already 
felt that they were working with too many farmers. So,  an intervention in which more farmers 
would participate might actually require more MSTs.  In other words, the marginal cost of an additional farmer is exceptionally high under the assumption that MSTs are working under full 
capacity, since another MST is required to serve another far mer.  However, the next 19 farmers 
have a very low marginal cost (the soil test) since that MST would be working with another farmer 
group.  So , we can consider that the marginal cost is approximately the same as the average cost 
above, assuming that the m arginal concept can be extended to the marginal MST.  
Next, we turn to the costs of sending messages through Viamo mobile.  One -time costs 
included developing the messages and recording the messages as MP3s. There was an 
additional platform license ($750) and monthly platform management costs were paid 
                                                
27 Furthermore, extension workers either require good access to 3G connections (or better) or the ability to travel to a 
place with a good connection on a regular basis.  In fact, connectivity to strong, reliable connections is an issue in the 
PADEE provinces, so whereas the programs were updated, for some MSTs it took several tries just to upload the data 
into the Grameen Intel server.  98 ($1250/month).28 Then Viamo charged a fee of $0.08 per minute for messages, billed by the 
second, and all Viamo costs included an administrative fee of 12%. Although these costs are 
relatively high for Cambodia (airtime costs are much lower, even across mobile companies), we 
will go forward assuming these costs, as the government is continuing to work with Viamo. This project ended up sending messages to approximately 1200 farmers, and we will only consider extending the enhanced model with the option to repeat messages, since it was frequently 
requested by farmers in follow -up phone calls.  Opportunity costs to farmers are negligible since 
calls last less than two minutes and receipt of phone calls is free for all providers in Cambodia.  
Since we used the platform for 5 months, we assume the total cost is $6720 for platform 
management .  Taking the phone calls made and scaling them to all be enhanced, we would have 
spent $2389.93 on calls. Even if we add a repeat option and assume that 20 percent of farmers use it, the cost of calls would be $2867.91.   Therefore, the average cost per farmer is $7.98, 
assuming the repeat option is added. So direct phone calls are substantially cheaper than the e-PADEE intervention, even though we have made assumptions inflating the average costs of the direct calls and minimizing the costs of the ePADEE intervention.  
However, the marginal costs of adding farmers to the model are much lower.  We’ve assumed 
that we make calls about 2 cr ops to each farmer above, and the platform management costs 
would be spread across more farmers if additional farmers were included.  So marginal costs are 
$2.39 per farmer, using the number of minutes used by our project as a guide. Average costs per 
farmer simply decline as more farmers are added, since the monthly management costs can be 
spread over a larger number of farmers.  
To give some context to these numbers , the ASPIRE budget for extension at the provincial 
level was $3.37 million in 2017. By the end of 2017, the project planned to be working with 198 farmer groups (or smallholder learning groups). If we assume an average of 25 members, which is relatively high, there would be a total of 4,950 beneficiaries; so total spending is presently 
projected  at a very high $682 per beneficiary. This amount seems high and is affected by 
continuing capital expenditures to ramp up the project. However, even if the project was reaching 
something closer to the projected 60,000 beneficiaries in the initial five provinces, the spending 
per beneficiary remains at $56 on average. Therefore,  the marginal cost of phone calls, under 
assumptions that likely inflated those costs, represent less than 5% of overall  average annual 
expenditures by ASPIRE on direct extension.  
In sum, the direct messaging intervention is a cheaper alternative on a per farmer basis, and 
its average costs decline as more farmers participate because the marginal costs are much lower 
than average costs.  Further, set up costs are lower, as tablets and their maintenance are 
substantially more expensive than updating messages related to basic advice.  Though neither 
intervention appears to have affected productivity in the short term, since farmers appear to like the direct call intervention it appears t o have more potential for scaling throughout the project . 
                                                
28 For this project, we negotiated a discount but we want to assume a scale up, so we assume a discount 
is not possible here.  99 8 Discussion  
We focus our discussion first on understanding threats to the validity of our results, and then we 
include a further brief discussion of the results. First, we examine attrition in more detail in both 
the PADEE and ASPIRE contexts. Second, we discuss whether other agricultural programs in 
Cambodia might have existed on a scale that could have affected our results.  Third, we discuss 
limitations of the P ADEE and ASPIRE pilots, respectively . Finally, we summarize the results and 
contextualize them. Given that the control groups could not have known much about the intervention in either case, we are not concerned about John Henry effects; given that we do not 
find productivity impacts, and the treatment was cluster randomized, Hawthorne effects should not have any impact.   
8.1 Attrition in PADEE  
The data collection team was able to revisit 1127 of the original 1200 households in the baseline 
data set, implying t hat the overall attrition rate was 6.1 percent. We are particularly interested in 
whether the attrition is related to either membership in the ICT or ICT Plus groups; if so, one might 
be concerned that differential attrition might affect our results. There fore, we first describe the 
attrition in more detail, and then regress an indicator for households that attrited on the two indicator variables for treatment status, a set of provincial dummy variables, and other household 
baseline characteristics.  
First, we note that the attrition in the PADEE data set is not geographically balanced (Figure 
15). Attrition was as low as 1 percent in Kandal, and as high as 11 percent, i n Prey Veng province. 
In analyzing in collaboration with CDRI, there is quite a bit of seasonal migration from Prey Veng 
into Phnom Penh, which borders it. Other provinces have attrition rates similar to the overall average.  
  100 Figure 15. Attrition Rate by Province, PADEE Sample  
 
Source: Authors’ Calculations, PADEE data set.  
Next, we examine attrition in a multivariate framework (  
  00.020.040.060.080.10.12
Kampot Kandal Prey Veng Svay Rieng Takeo TotalAttrition Rate
Province101 Table 63). Using a probit model, we regress a dummy variable for households that attrited on the 
two treatment group indicators (column 1), the treatment indicators and province indicators 
(column 2),  and then the variables in column 2 and a set of baseline control variables (column 3). 
In all three cases, we find no correlation between attrition and either of the treatment indicators. As the attrition is not correlated with either of the treatments, r egardless of the variables for which 
we control, we can conclude that attrition did not affect the PADEE analysis.

8.2 Attrition in ASPIRE  
The research team was somewhat concerned that the PADEE attrition rate was high. Therefore, 
IFPRI worked with CDRI prior to the collection of the ASPIRE baseline to improve tracking 
procedures throughout. The resulting attrition rate in the ASPIRE sample between 2017 and 2018 is much lower than in PADEE, at 2.4 percent, demonstrating that improved tracking procedures 
helped lim it attrition.  
Not surprisingly, the attrition rate does not appear to differ by treatment status, given the low 
overall rate. The treatment group specific attrition rates vary between 1.6 percent (control group) and 3.2 percent (basic messages).  Clearly,  this variation is not large enough to affect any impact 
estimates, so we do not conduct any further analysis.  
8.3 Potential Influence of Other Projects  
Another concern is whether other projects in the intervention areas might have affected the results.  There have been few ongoing agricultural projects during the study period, but major ones 
can be identified fairly easily.  USAID’s Helping Address Rural Vulnerabilities and Ecosystem 
Stability (HARVEST) project ran from 2011 to 2016; it worked in a different set of provinces than 
the PADEE project. The follow up project, HARVEST II, only began in April 2017, and although it 
is working in Pursat and Battambang, it is unlikely that project activities were mature enough to 
affect our study. Similarly, the primary A sian Development Bank on agriculture, the Tonle Sap 
Poverty Reduction and Smallholder Development Project, is managed by the government and therefore by definition works in different places than are covered through PADEE or ASPIRE.  
Unfortunately, our surveys did not collect information about whether households were 103 participating in any other projects that might have indirect effects on households in either pilot 
project.  
Nonetheless, we can use the data to measure whether treatment groups had received 
differential attention either fro m NGOs (which would likely be smaller projects if so) or from the 
private sector, from the perspective of  agricultural  extension. We measured the proportion of 
farmers in each treatment group that report hearing at least two ext ension messages from either 
an NGO source (rather than the government) or a private provider  in baseline data from both 
projects.  For PADEE, we focus on rice messages.  We find that almost no farmers who grow rice 
report having received extension from sources other than the government; 12 of the 1007 farmers who reported growing rice at the baseline received such extension. Clearly, outside forces did not 
directly affect the PADEE pilot.  
For the ASPIRE project, we find slightly rates of contact with extens ions from NGOs or the 
private sector than among the PADEE sample. About 5 percent of the ASPIRE sample have 
experience with messages coming from outside government related to rice production, and about 
2 percent have some experience with vegetable extension messages. Whereas these rates are fairly low and are not likely to materially affect the results in aggregate, it could be that the rates 
differ between treatment groups and therefore could plausibly affect the results in section 7.  
We therefore next com pute the treatment group specific rates at baseline ( Table 64). We find 
that we cannot reject the hypothesis that the rates are all the same, nor that a hypothesis that any 
pair of rates are the same. Thus, we conclude that the low rates of contact with extension 
messages outside ASPIRE are not likely to affect the project either.

Note: Standard errors in brackets. Size of each group are in italics. For no pair can we reject the null that the two

As noted in the cost effectiveness section, the ASPIRE intervention appears quite scalable with 
low marginal costs; some care should be placed in considering whether the vegetable messages 
were good enough, since they were clearly less effective than the r ice and chicken messages. 
Whereas there are no short term productivity impacts, farmer perceptions of impacts suggest they 
might be measurable in a much larger sample.  104 8.4 Limitations: PADEE  
There are some specific limitations to each component of the study t hat are worth again 
highlighting. First, the type of extension that was offered was limited by the e -PADEE software.  
As discussed earlier, an initial limitation is that the software gave somewhat automated 
recommendations once the soil characteristics wer e measured. It was not designed to be 
interactive for good reason—there are other tools, such as WhatsApp, Viber, and Line that all can 
be used in association with e- PADEE. However, it might have been more useful to MSTs if they 
had been further trained to ask their peers for help answering interesting questions.  
Second, the software was, as of the implementation in this project, limited to a rice module. Rice production in Cambodia could increase substantially in the aggregate agronomically, but it is not  
entirely clear that doing so would be economically optimal, meaning that the costs of additional 
inputs (or effort) might exceed the potential additional revenues from increasing yields. An alternative way to make more money at the farm level would be thr ough growing more vegetables; 
however, vegetable value chains are more complex as they spoil quickly, and more importantly 
the vegetable module had not yet been developed when the pilot was implemented.  
Third, the project might have been different had we been able to obtain extra funds for monitoring 
MST performance throughout the growing period. The MSTs essentially were asked to implement 
the e- PADEE pilot on their own, as the GDA did not provide their normal support due to budget 
limitations. However, th at would have greatly affected the project costs as well, making any 
impacts less cost effective. Alternatively,  the incentives for the MST group could have been made 
larger, but it is not clear whether that would have induced more visits or not.  
Fourth,  recall that in subsection 7.3 we found that the ICT group was more likely to have used 
fertilizer, in larger amounts, than the other two groups at baseline. Had we found statistically 
significant impacts on production, this difference might have been meaningful for the analysis. 
However, we found no such impacts; as such, it is hard to argue that accounting differently for 
this difference would have meaningfully affected the results.  
Fifth, recall that all 60 MSTs originally selected for the project were ini tially trained to use the 
ePADEE software, a year before the trial began, and could have been implementing on their own; randomization took place at the MST/cluster pair level. There could have been MSTs that 
implemented some of the recommendations with farmers in the control group; the evidence would 
be that we do note that some portion of households within the control group state that MSTs 
brought tablets with them. However, the software had not been updated, so it is not clear how 
effective such extension would have been. Moreover, given that we found more intensity of 
farmers worked in with extension in the treatment groups, it should not have had a major effect 
on top -line results.  
Since MAFF has made tablets available to all CEWs working in ASPIRE, which includes the Grameen Intel tool as well as others, further use of tablet -based extension is already being used.  
We are not aware of much tablet -based extension that has been very effective, with the exception 
of video (van Campenhout et al., 2017).  We therefore suggest that MAFF consider finding ways 105 to try to pre- load videos with tailored messages onto tablets held by CEWs prior to sending the 
tablets into the field (or refreshing them at any province level meetings), so that they can best 
make use of this technology.  We return to this issue in the subsection on key lessons.  
8.5 Limitations: ASPIRE  
As with the PADEE pilot project, there are some limitations within the ASPIRE context.  Similar to 
the PADEE context, one obvious limitation is that we could not establish a “pure” control group. 
The results are therefore additional to what can be considered ASPIRE as usual. A concern might 
be that some CEWs worked quite extensively with thei r ASPIRE groups; if so, then one might be 
concerned that the phone calls provided no new information. We attempt to limit this concern through the stratification at the CEW level, but it could limit the treatment effects.  
Second, the phone calls were limit ed as they did not have repeat options. We were concerned 
that farmers would tire quickly of the calls when setting them up, and in fact did a review at 4 
weeks to see how many farmers were continuing to listen to calls; we assumed there would be a relativ ely large group of farmers who never listened to calls. Instead, the information was much 
appreciated. We did give information about the CEW’s phone number at the end of each call but 
a repeat option and potentially a call -in for the same information would have likely enhanced 
impact at little cost.  
Third, the sample design limited how much we were able to find. We called a substantial number of farmers who never appear in our data set, particularly in the enhanced plus group. As a result, 
we are “missing” a deeper understanding of impacts among farmers who received the calls. 
Indeed, the proportion of farmers in the treatment groups who reported receiving them in the 
survey appears quite low, so our intent -to-treat effects are dampened by the proportion of farmers 
who actually received calls. Some portion of farmers in the sample did not have valid phone 
numbers; in retrospect, an easy way to have increased statistical power in the sample would have 
been to survey only farmers who had valid phone numbers (al though that could have created an 
alternative type of selection bias in the result, selecting on valid phone numbers).    
Fourth, recall that our sample included both farmer group and non- farmer group members. 
Whereas including both helped us begin to expl ore how information moves around communities 
in the social network section, it reduces the eternal validity of the pilot from the perspective of ASPIRE. We were also not able to include as many provinces in the ASPIRE pilot, since there 
were few CEWs in the other three provinces and the sample exclusions necessitated removing 
them from the sample. So before extending the pilot to other areas, it might be worthwhile to 
further explore other secondary sources of data to assess how comparable the farmers in ou r 
sample are to others.  
An alternative way to design this pilot would have been to work with a much larger sample and to conduct shorter phone surveys rather than long form household visits as were conducted, though it is not clear that a larger sample was  actually available to us for the pilot.  The benefit would 
have been to be able to identify smaller impacts. However, that type of design was not clearly 
available to us in this context, given that we worked in nearly all the appropriate CEW groups that 106 were available to us.  We could have intensified some of the data collection within groups (e.g. 
among farmer group members who did not participate in the survey), but it would not have been 
possible in 2017 to massively increase the sample size.  
8.6 Key Lesson s 
Now that we have discussed threats to the validity of our results, we summarize and contextualize  
them in this section. As with other sections, we start with PADEE and follow with ASPIRE, and 
then we place them in the context of the literature.  
8.6.1  Results Summary: PADEE 
Within the PADEE intervention, we broadly find evidence that the use of the software was effective 
at teaching farmers additional rice extension messages, some of which were put into place by 
farmers. Farmers in the two treatment groups were about 50 percent more likely to report 
receiving agricultural extension than the control group, and the percentage of farmers reporting 
using seed and fertilizer recommendations increased by about 5 and 12 percentage points, 
respectively. However, we do not find any impacts on  the extensive margin for fertilizer; 
households in the treatment groups do not appear to have increased the intensive of fertilizer use 
on average. We do not find impacts on either  rice production or productivity.  
The heterogeneity r egressions we ran suggest some interesting differences between the ICT and 
ICT plus treatment groups. Social connections appear to have been important in determining 
impacts in the ICT group, but this relationship was broken in the incentives treatment. These 
results suggest that changing incentive structures within the Cambodian extension system could 
broaden the types of farmers who receive extension.  
8.6.2  Results Summary: ASPIRE  
In the ASPIRE pilot, the monitoring results show that households in both the basic and enhanced 
groups list ened to entire calls about 60  percent of the time, throughout the period in which calls 
were implemented. Within the sample, farmers in the two enhanced treatment groups were more 
likely to report having received the calls than the basic treatment group, and about twice as many 
farmers perceived the calls had production impacts in the enhanced treatment groups (8-9 
percentage points over the control group for rice) than the basic treatment group (about 5 
percentage points). Though more farmers received calls on vegetables than on chickens, by this 
measure farmers found the chicken messages more useful, perhaps because more of them were 
already keeping chickens. Importantly, for most of these measures heterogeneity is not an issue; 
since calls were made to farmers both in and outside of farmer groups set up for ASPIRE, it is 
useful to know that farmer group members and other farmers responded to the calls at approximately the same rates.  
We further find that the information that w e sent through calls spread somewhat through the 
village.  At least for rice and chicken messages, farmers who received calls were more likely to share messages with others in the village who had not received calls. As with the receipt of 
messages in gener al and the perceived impacts on productivity, farmers in the enhanced 
message groups were about twice as likely to report having shared messages than those in the 107 basic messages group, and farmers were more likely to have shared or heard about the rice and  
chicken messages.  
We find some mixed results related to either techniques applied or input use in response to the 
treatment, and we do not find strong positive results on changes in productivity. Among the 
enhanced message group only, we find impacts on the use of improved seed, NPK, urea, and 
pesticides in rice production. We do not find similar results for the enhanced plus group. However, 
these effects do not appear to translate over into increased production or income among farmers, 
nor do we find changes for chicken or vegetable production.  
8.6.3  Context  and Going Forward  
The PADEE and ASPIRE pilots that were implemented in Cambodia  fit well into what is a 
developing body of evidence about how ICT can be used to enhance agricultural extension. In 
general , technology is increasingly being used in propagate information in a fast and cost -effective 
manner (Aker 2011; Nakasone et al., 2014; Nakasone and Torero, 2016). However, the best 
methods for using ICT and the extent it can help are still uncertain.  
Our r esults on the e- PADEE pilot demonstrate that we may have been using the wrong 
technology. An alternative that demonstrates promise is ICT-mediated extension with video. 
Recent randomized trials in Ethiopia, India and Uganda have demonstrated effectiveness in 
achieving outcomes such as increased knowledge and awareness of agricultural practices, higher rates of technology adoption, better crop yields, higher farm incomes, or improvements in 
household welfare, (Van Campenhout et al., 2018 ; Vasilaky, 2015; Aba te 2018). The results we 
show in the PADEE heterogeneity analysis suggests that the type of farmer that can be helped 
by tablet -based  extension may change; an interesting extension of this work might be to test using 
video- based extension along with varying extension worker incentives and monitoring.  
Our ASPIRE results are most similar to related messages that have been sent by SMS in other 
countries (e.g. Feder et al., 2004). As in those models, we find modest changes in knowledge and 
practices. Cambodia is a bit of a unique case, in that SMS is not an effective way of trying to 
convey modest messages; however, as smartphones continue to spread, it may become effective 
in the relatively near future.  Therefore,  push voice messages  may not work in other contexts  as 
well, though we think they are well placed to work in other parts of Cambodia just as well.  
In this context, because the government was the implementing partner, we ensured that 
messages were salient. Other studies have shown that affinity between the messenger and the 
expected audience plays an important role in ensuring impacts (e.g. Vasilaky et al., 2015; Abate 
et al., 2018). The challenge in using both types of extensi on in the future— whether tablet -based,  
or voice or SMS based—is to tailor more generic messages to both differing and changing agroecologies, while harnessing existing social str uctures and customs to appeal different types 
of farmers.  
9 Findings for Policy and Practice  
Our main findings only suggest changes along part of the theory of change, rather than moving all the way to productivity and farmer income. However, we need to plac e our results into the 108 policy discussion. Based on ASPIRE budgets, a substantial amount of money is still being spent 
per pr ospective beneficiary . Second, there is a feeling that the government should get “out” of 
extension in the medium term. In other wor ds, policy discussions suggest that the private sector 
become more involved with providing extension and finding ways for farmers to pay for it. Along 
a similar line of reasoning, it is believed that farmers would pay more for customized extension. We briefly describe main messages for policy makers and then for implementation, which largely 
suggests further research.  
9.1 Implications for Policy  
Our findings have at least two important implications for policy.  First, there is clearly a revealed desire among farmers for more access to basic extension information, based on the monitoring 
results for ASPIRE. As a result, the government should consider ways to continue to provide basic 
information to farmers using cheap methods. We tested direct voice messages in t he ASPIRE 
pilot in part because SMS messages were not possible in this context; an alternative is to provide 
a call -in service for farmers to get information through a menu driven system.
29 We think  our 
results suggest that  both are potentially promising wa ys to deliver basic messages to farmers (the 
former we have demonstrated; the latter would still need further evidence). W e understand that 
the government is continuing to work with Viamo mobile on a call -in service that is already 
available.  We note that continuing to make phone calls or providing support to a call -in system 
would represent a very small share of the annual ASPIRE budget.  That said, more monitoring 
and evaluation would be worthwhile to understand whether these information systems can lead to increased production or income among farmers.  
Second, in a related recommendation, we believe it is important to think about the definition of the private sector in this context. Cell phone and other technology companies may have good incentives to offer access to call -in systems or even to sign up fa rmers for direct call extension, 
as these services represent ways to maintain their customer base, which often switch companies when better offers become available. These companies are potentially a better bet than working directly with input suppliers, fo r example, who could bundle extension with other services. A 
problem with that type of extension is that it is often narrow relative to what government agents 
or NGOs provide (e.g. de Brauw et al., 2018).   
On a third note, if CEWs are to be provided with t ablets, we believe that whereas systems like e -
PADEE can be effective, there are other systems that appear to provide more promise at the 
moment. Specifically, we think recent evidence from trials using video- based extension on tablets 
might hold more prom ise than e- PADEE or something similar for delivering impacts. We suggest 
at least exploring the development of videos that could be placed on CEW tablets when they are in places for meetings with better network coverage.  
                                                
29 Many rural farmers in Cambodia have cell phones that cannot text with the Khmer script; hence they tend 
to use phones for calls rather than text messages.  109 9.2 Implications for Implementation  
As noted several times in the report, we did not find impacts on final outcomes, such as 
agricultural production or income. However, the relatively cheap model of ICT (direct calls) 
appeared more promising on a cost effectiveness, basis, and it could be that with a longer trial, impacts on such out comes could have materialized. O ne potential implication is that it would be 
worth continuing to send messages such as these, or at least the rice and chicken messages, to 
ideally test for impacts from repeated exposure.  One could improve the system to allow for either 
callbacks or repeated messages in doing so.  
An interesting test might also be to test direct calls against encouragement to use a call -in service. 
Whereas the direct call requires no effort, a call -in service requires the farmer to call the number 
and go through whatever process exists to find the message that they would want to hear. Such 
a test would be both interesting behaviorally but would also potentially help explore w hether call -
in services can be as effective, as it is easier to ask the private sector to provide them. One way 
to achieve a cheaper way to conduct such an evaluation would be to use a larger sample and 
phone surveys. a model of such a survey might be to s end a data collection team to the field just 
to gather phone numbers, and then to conduct a short phone survey; our experience in the e-
PADEE evaluation shows that phone surveys in Cambodia are well received.  With such a model, 
a fairly large sample size could be achieved at fairly low cost. An alternative would be to try to 
provide pamphlets with the same information, but doing so would require a quality assurance 
process that could be complex in Cambodia; for example, the initial e- PADEE trial was held up 
due to long discussions about which words to use for different aspects of rice production.
