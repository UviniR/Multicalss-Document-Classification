Abstract
Background: Uganda’s maternal mortality rate remains unacceptably high. Mobile phones can potentially provide afford-
able means of accessing maternal health services even among the otherwise hard-to-reach populations. Evidence about the
acceptability and feasibility of mobile phone-based interventions targeting illiterate women, however, is limited.
Objective: To assess the acceptability and feasibility of a mobile phone-based multimedia application (MatHealth app) to
support maternal health amongst illiterate pregnant women in rural southwestern Uganda.
Methods: 80 pregnant women initiating antenatal care from Mbarara regional referral hospital were enrolled in a pilot
randomized controlled trial and followed until six weeks after delivery. The 40 women in the intervention group received a
MatHealth app composed of educational videos/audios, clinic appointment reminders, and the calling function. Qualitativeinterviews on acceptability of this technology were carried out with 30 of the intervention participants. An inductive, content
analytic approach was used to analyze qualitative data. Quantitative feasibility data were recorded and summarized
descriptively.
Results: Participants reported that the intervention is acceptable as it enabled them adopt good maternal health practices,
enhanced social support from spouses, provided clinic appointment reminders, and facilitated communication with health-care providers. Challenges included: phone sharing (74%), accidental deletion of the application 15 (43%), lack of electricity
15 (43%), and inability to set up a reminder function 20 (57%).
Conclusion: The MatHealth app is an acceptable and feasible intervention among illiterate women, in a resource limited
setting. Future efforts should focus on optimized application design, spouse orientation, and incorporating economic
support to overcome the challenges we encountered.

Background
Maternal health issues
Compared to high income countries, maternal and
child mortality rates remain unacceptably high inmany low and middle income countries (LMICs).
Globally, 300,000 women die annually from avoidable
maternal health-related complications, 99% of whichhappen in LMICs with Sub-Saharan Africa aloneaccounting for 66%.
1Uganda’s maternal mortality
rate is estimated at 343 maternal deaths per 100,000
live births, which is one of the highest rates in theworld.
2Over 17 women and 106 children die every
day from maternal and child health issues in
Uganda.3Many of these deaths happen in rural areas
especially among poor and illiterate women, who com-pared to educated women are less likely to receive ante-natal care and deliver at the clinic.
4The World Health
Organization (WHO) envisions a world where every
pregnant woman and new born baby receives qualitycare through pregnancy, child birth and postnatal peri-ods.
5The health and well-being of pregnant women has
far-reaching impacts—it does not only ensure the
health of mothers, but also warrants the health oftheir babies, and the rest of their family members.
6,7
Many of the maternal and child deaths could be
avoided given timely access to the right care and
resources during pregnancy, at a time of delivery, andafter delivery.
8Illiteracy, lack of reliable information,
poverty, distance to health care centers, and cultural
practices are some of the barriers that limit access to
quality maternal health care.9,10In Uganda, only 58%
of pregnant mothers attend at least four antenatal visitspreviously recommended by WHO
11(WHO currently
recommends eight visits) while over 30% of women
deliver outside the facility without a skilled birthattendant.
12
Mobile health technologies for maternal health
Given widespread telephone adoption and mobile net-work coverage in sub-Saharan Africa,
13mobile tech-
nologies (such as mobile phones) can provideaffordable means of providing maternal health services
to women including those that would otherwise find it
challenging to access the services. This approach isreported to be acceptable and feasible in extendingother health services such as HIV,
14tuberculosis,15
and sexual health16care to rural poor populations in
the same setting—Uganda. However, in low resourcesettings (LRSs), studies reporting about the applicationof mobile technologies in maternal health are limited.
The modest existing studies report some promising
results e.g. mobile tools enabled access topregnant-related information,
17and increased service
utilization.18Besides, the prevailing studies mainly uti-
lize Short Messaging Services (SMS) which are not
appropriate for illiterate women since they unable to
read.19,20This approach leaves out a significant
number of women since 41.2% of women in Ugandaonly completed some primary level education.
12
Overall, there is need for more research documentingthe application of mobile health technologies to sup-port maternal health among illiterate women especiallyin low resource setting. This paper documents how illit-
erate women (not having studied at all or not having
studied beyond primary seven or elementary education)perceive a mobile application composed of maternalhealth-related tailored video and audio messages,
appointment reminders and calling function. This
application is known as the MatHealth app for thepurpose of this paper.
Methods
Study design and setting
The study utilized a mixed methods study design.
Participants (pregnant mothers) were recruited from
mbarara regional referral hospital (MRRH), which is
the largest hospital in rural southwestern Uganda.According to the hospital records, the MRRH employs11 obstetricians and 22 midwives and performs over
10,000 deliveries annually with a maternal mortality
rate of 270/100,000 live birth, caesarean section rateof 30% and a perinatal mortality rate of 56/1000.
21
Sociodemographic and basic health data are captured
from pregnant women during their first visit, and
stored in paper-based antenatal registers. Eachwoman is given an antenatal card that contains herbiodata as well as the date of the next appointment.
Women are expected to attend at least eight antenatal
appointments, and they are supposed to bring theirantenatal cards on every visit. The clinic verbally pro-vides group-based maternal health talks to pregnant
women scheduled according to the trimesters—first tri-
mester talks are offered on Tuesdays, second trimestertalks are offered on Wednesdays, while third trimesterhealth talks are offered on Thursdays. Topics covered
in these talks include nutrition and birth preparedness.
There are currently no follow-up mechanism for preg-nant women who miss their antenatal appointments.
Selection of study participants
Between Jan 2019 and Dec 2019, we purposively select-ed pregnant women receiving antenatal care fromMRRH. Inclusion criteria were as follows: a) initiatingantenatal care at MRRH at the earliest presentation in2 DIGITAL HEALTHthe first or second trimester, b) being illiterate (not
having studied beyond primary seven or elementaryeducation), c) 18 years and above, d) residents ofMbarara (within 20 km of MRRH), e) ability to use
mobile phones, f) willing and able to give informed
consent, g) able to speak Runyankole (local language).We excluded women who did not qualify per the inclu-sion criteria or who were not able or willing to giveinformed consent.
The MatHealth app
The MatHealth app was developed using Java pro-gramming language, while the database that hosts mul-timedia messages was developed using SQlite. It is anoffline (stand-alone) application which does not run on
the internet. The development of the MatHealth app
followed an iterative and approach that involvedengaging potential users (women and healthcare pro-viders) in series of focus group discussions (FGDs) tosuggest and review the app designs.
20,30These discus-
sions included letting the prospective users suggest con-
tents of messages, as well as practically logging in and
navigating the app. Each FGD informed further refine-ment of the app until users reported being comfortablesatisfied and comfortable with the design. A pictorialpassword enabled access to the application. The app
was installed on low-cost smart phones provided by
the project at enrollment. MatHealth app was devel-oped to entirely run on android smart phones due tomultimedia videos/audios compatibility. Women wereprovided with solar chargers to supplement electricity
charging. The app has three major functionalities;
a. The video/audio function; which provides 30 locally
customized videos and audios (in the local lan-
guage—Runyankole) with personalized maternal
health information sent monthly to the womenbased on their pregnancy stages and babies’growth. Content for multimedia videos/audios weredeveloped by a senior obstetrician and gynecologist
and a nutritionist from MRRH drawing from the
approved Ugandan Ministry of health/WHO mater-nal health guidelines. Contents of the videos/audiomessages include; nutrition, breast feeding, HIV test-ing, spouse involvement, family planning, danger
signs, preparing for child birth, care during pregnan-
cy, care during delivery and postnatal care.
b. The appointment reminder function that allows the
women to set the dates and reminders for their nextantenatal care appointment.
c. The calling function through which the women can
communicate with the maternal health specialist(gynecologist) who was a co-investigator on thisstudy.There is also a login module which uses pictorial
password to allow access to the app.
Study procedures
This paper reports a qualitative evaluation of a ran-domized trial (results of which are being analyzed)
composed of a total of 80 study participants (pregnant
women) who were enrolled and followed until six weeks
after delivery. A simple random number generator(https://www.random.org/) was used to determine
study arm assignments of the participants. After
screening and consenting, participants were random-
ized 1:1 (NCT04089800) as follows:
1. Maternal health application arm – Study partici-
pants received a mobile phone-based MatHealth
app that enabled them to receive tailored monthly
maternal and child health-related video and audio
messages, set clinic attendance appointment
reminders, and talk to an obstetrician and
gynecologist.
2. The routine care only arm (control arm) – Study
participants in this arm did not receive the
MatHealth app. This group didn’t participate in
interviews for assessing the acceptability and feasi-
bility since the investigators were interested in
assessing the user experiences of the application.
Each participant in the MatHealth app arm was
trained at enrollment about the mobile app and received
a relatively low cost smartphone (about USD 60 per
phone) with the MatHealth app installed on it.
Participants were informed that they could retain the
phones after the study closure. The research assistant
(whose has an MSc in health informatics) and the app
developers (researchers) explained and demonstratedhow the app works including how to login to access
the app, view the multimedia videos, audios, set ante-
natal appointment reminders, and call in to talk to the
obstetrician and gynecologist. Participants were then
given the app and asked to explain what it does and
to practically demonstrate how it works to the RAs.
Data collection
This is a qualitative inquiry within a pilot randomizedtrial. From a private space at a research office near the
MRRH (recruitment site), the research assistant WT
carried out semi-structured face to face interviews
with pregnant mothers from the intervention arm(those that used MatHealth app) until reaching themat-
ic saturation (at the 30
thparticipant) when no new
information arose from the interviews.” Each interview
lasted between 40 and 50 minutes. All questions in theMusiimenta et al. 3interview guide were translated into the local language
(Runyankole) and back-translated to English by a dif-ferent translator, after which the two versions were
compared for accuracy. The interviews were carried
out in Runyankole (local language), digitally recorded,transcribed, and translated to English. Interviewsmainly elicited information about participants’ under-
standings and experiences of the key components of the
app (videos/audios, appointment reminder function,and the calling function). Following each interview,researchers AM and GM reviewed transcripts for qual-
ity, clarity, and detail. WT administered surveys to
pregnant women to collect information on socio-demographics, socio economic status, food security,and basic health. Quantitative feasibility data were
recorded.
Analysis
We used inductive content analysis22to derive catego-
ries describing and summarizing how participants per-ceived the intervention. Initially, AM, and WT, and
GM reviewed and discussed 20% of transcripts for
content relevant to participants’ experiences of theintervention. AM and WT then assembled a codebookfrom the identified concepts, using an iterative process,
which included developing codes to represent content,
writing operational definitions, and selecting illustra-tive quotes. Researchers NP, JK, and ACE reviewedand discussed the codebook. Following completion of
the codebook, AM and WT applied codes using
NVIVO 11. Differences in coding were harmonizedthrough discussion. WT used STATA 13 to describestudy participants’ characteristic, their socio economic
status, food security, basic health, and feasibility data.
Results
Survey results: Participant characteristics
Of 113 screened pregnant women, 33 (29%) were
excluded. Participants were excluded for (individualscould have >1 criterion): not initiating antenatal care
at the earliest presentation in the first or second trimes-
ter; i.e. women in the third trimester ( n¼13; 12%),
literate (studied beyond primary seven) ( n¼6; 5%),
living beyond the study catchment area; 20 km from
the MRRH ( n¼11; 10%), being <18 years old ( n¼1;
1%), and/or inability to provide informed consent(n¼2; 2%). A total of 80 (71%) pregnant women, of
whom 9(11%) were persons living with HIV/AIDS,
enrolled in the study as shown in Table 1 below. The
majority of participants were in their mid-20s, had nosource of income, and did not have enough food intheir households.As indicated in Table 2, the majority of the women
shared their mobile phones, and used the app to con-
sult the gynecologist.
Interview results
As explained below, participants (pregnant women)reported that the MatHealth app was beneficial in var-
ious ways including: 1) enabling the adoption of good
maternal and child health practices e.g. adherence to
antenatal/postnatal care, and exclusive breast feeding,
2) enhancing spouse support and involvement e.g.
being escorted to the clinic for antenatal care, 3)reminding them attend antenatal/postnatal appoint-
ments, and 4) facilitating communication with health-
care providers. Additionally, participants reported that
the app was easy to use, and that the multimedia infor-
mation contained in the app was easy to understand
and recall. Participants reported that the functionality
of the app was limited by socioeconomic issues, and
technological challenges.Table 1. Socio-demographic and basic health status characteristics

maternal and child health practices: Participantsreported that watching the videos contained in theMatHealth app enabled them adopt good maternaland child health practices such as saving money to pre-pare for delivery, adoption of malaria prevention strat-egies (e.g. use of mosquito nets, cutting bushes),attending antenatal and postnatal appointments, pre-
paring for facility-based delivery, exclusive breastfeed-
ing, as well as proper nutritional habits.
I increased on the number of times I breastfeed my baby.
The baby that follows this one used to fall sick manytimes, but this one has not fallen sick may be because Ifollowed the videos to exclusively breast him (Breastfeeding mother, 30yrs)
I have learnt that I am supposed to go for antenatal
because with my first pregnancy I could do only oneantenatal checkup throughout the nine months but with
this one I have been able to do antenatal checkups on a
monthly basis. /C24(Breast-feeding mother, 40yrs).
Women described adopting good maternal health
practices compared to their previous pregnancies.
Enhances spouse support and involvement: Some
participants reported watching the videos from theapp with their spouses which enabled them obtain var-ious social support. This included being escorted to theclinic for a maternal and child health-related appoint-ments, providing nutritional and feeding support,purchasing essentials required for delivery, as well as
providing transport/permission to the clinic for antena-tal services and delivery.
I shared with him the video that tells us to go with our
husbands for check-up. After watching the video, he was
convinced, and we agreed and went together, carried out
check-up together including for HIV and we produced ahealthy baby. /C24(Breast feeding mother, 30yrs).
The video that specifically demonstrates the need for
spouses to take an active role in maternal and childhealth encouraged spouses to support their wives.
Reminds attending clinic appointment: Participants
reported being reminded to attend their clinic appoint-ment by the app’s reminder function. Consequently,some participants never missed any clinic appointment.
R: The app has been beneficial to me because it reminds
me to attend my clinic appointments. Because of thereminder messages, I did not miss attending any of myappointments. /C24(Breast feeding mother, 30yrs).
Participants reported feeling obliged to comply with
these reminders in order not to disappoint the studyteam and healthcare providers who minded abouttheir health by giving them the app.
Facilitates communication with healthcare workers:
Participants reported using the calling function of theapplication to consult healthcare providers aboutmaternal and child health-related issues such asTable 2. Technical feasibility of the maternal health application.
Issues Comment (n ¼35 (%))
Phone charging 15 (43%) of participants reported not having electricity for charging phones in their homes.
Phone sharing 26 (74%) of the participants reported sharing their phones with other people especially spouses.
Two of these participants’ study phones were in possession of their spouses at time collectingthis study, who were not staying with the participants during the study time.
Phone selling 3 (9%) reported having sold their phones to raise some money for basic needs.
Setting of reminding 20 (57%) reported having not used the application to set antenatal/postnatal reminders. The study
team set the first reminders, but all participants had to set subsequent reminders. Althoughparticipants were oriented in setting reminders, they later confessed having failed to set thereminders. Some of them resorted to coming to the study office monthly for assistance withsetting appointment dates.
Calling function 23 (66%) of the women used the app to call the maternal health specialist (gynecologist)
Re-installing the application 15 (43%) of the participants had their applications re-installed by the study team due to accidental
deletion by either the participants themselves or the ones they shared the phones with.
Lost follow-up 5 (13%) of participants were lost to follow up due to non-functioning phone numbers.Musiimenta et al. 5inquiries about potential danger signs, confirmation of
labor signs, as well organizing for facility-baseddelivery.
I used the call function to call a doctor when I started
feeling some pain in my lower stomach, I suspected some-
thing, so I called the doctor and he told me to come to the
hospital and they worked on me, so if I didn’t have thisphone I wouldn’t have been helped. I really thank you
people for giving me this phone and its contents. /C24
(Breast feeding mother, 34yrs).
Some participants reported that mobile phone-based
consultations saved them the cost of having to come tothe clinic for inquiries that can easily be done onphone.
Challenging issues. Socioeconomic issues: Some partici-
pants reported lacking money to cover maternal and
child health-related costs such transport to the clinic,
buying the required foods and drinks, purchasingrequirements for delivery as well as meeting the cost
of delivery especially in case of delivery by operation
which involves extra costs. These constraints limitedthe adaption of good maternal and child health practi-ces advocated by the mobile health application.
The contents on the phone are good, but sometimes I
don’t have money to buy the foods/drinks recommended.
Also sometimes even if I am reminded to go the clinic, I
don’t have transport to take me there. Although I some-times I walk to clinic, it is a long distance. My husband
has no job, he just makes ropes and the little he gets is for
buying basic food for the family. /C24(Breast feeding
mother, 33 years).
A few participants sold their phones before study
closure. Others reported being mocked for havingsmart phones yet they cannot afford basic costs such
as transport to the clinic, and purchasing requirements
for delivery.
Technological challenges: Some participants that
lacked electricity in their homes found it challenging
to charge their phones. Before the study provided sup-plementary solar chargers, these participants whoresorted to taking their phones for charging at public
charging points reported unauthorized utilization of
their phones resulting in accidental uninstallation ofthe maternal health application, as well exchange
of their phone batteries.
When I took my phone to the center for charging, they
opened it, deleted your videos and audios, and they also
exchanged my battery and gave me a dead one. /C24
(Breastfeeding mother, 28yrs).The challenge of phone sharing was highlighted by
some participants who reported sharing the phones
especially with the spouses. A participant narrated
how phone sharing resulted in accidental deletion ofthe app (despite being password protected), and alsolimited her access to, and usability of the app particu-
larly when the phone was with her spouse.
I use it [phone] with my husband. He used to disturb me
[by using the phone] but when I came to your officesyour colleague talked to him and he no longer disturbs
me like before. He used to take it away from me, but now
days he put his line in my phone, so I give it to him whensomeone calls him but the challenge is that sometimes Icannot find my videos when he gives me back the phone .
/C24(Breastfeeding mother, 34yrs).
Some participants changed their sim cards (tele-
phone lines) attached to the phones that containedthe app. Attempts to reach them through the telephone
numbers of the contacts persons they had provided at
enrollment failed—the numbers of their contact peoplecould also not go through, while those that wentthrough claimed that they are no longer in contact
with the participants, resulting in lost to follow ups.
Discussion
In this study, participants (illiterate pregnant women)
reported that the MatHealth app composed of videosand audio, appointment reminders, and the callingfunction was acceptable. They reported that the appli-cation enabled them adopt good maternal and child
health practices (such as adherence to antenatal/post-
natal care, exclusive breast feeding, preparing forfacility-based delivery, malaria prevention strategies,proper nutritional habits) that they would otherwise
find challenging to adopt without the app.
Additionally, some women reported intentionally shar-ing the contents of the app with their spouses, whichtriggered their spouses’ support and involvement in
their prenatal and postnatal care. For instance, some
spouses started escorting their wives to clinic for ante-natal care for the first time in their lives, while othersbought foods they had never bought before as a result
of watching educative contents provided by app.
Through the reminding function of the app, partici-pants were reminded to attend antenatal appointments.Also, through the app’s calling function, women
reported being able to make pregnancy and child-
related inquiries communicate to healthcare providersin cases of. They found the app easy to use, and itscontents easy to understand and recall. However,
socioeconomic challenges, and technological issues
(e.g. charging the phones, phone sharing, and changing6 DIGITAL HEALTHphone numbers) limited the feasibility of the
application.
After watching video and audio messages about
breasting contained in the MatHealth app, participantsgained knowledge about proper breasting practices andexclusively breastfeed their babies for the first
6 months, which improved the health of their babies.
They enjoyed watching the videos while at the sametime learning from them. Information recall was
enhanced by the opportunity to replay the videos/
audios several times at their own convenient times.Adopting exclusive breastfeeding is an important mile-
stone in these illiterate population, since, compared to
educated women, women of low literate levels are notlikely to exclusively breast feed their babies.
23This
could be attributed by the possible lack of accurate
information such as information about the benefits of
exclusive breasting. Having accurate information is keyto adoption of sound breastfeeding practices.
24
Breastfeeding is an optimum source of nutrition forchildren, which can ensure child health and survival,and lead to life-long health and well-being. Despite
the benefits, worldwide, only 40% of infants are exclu-
sively breastfed within their first six months.
1
Educational interventions especially those targetingilliterate women are needed to create awareness about
the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding. As reported in
the current study, these interventions can be successful-ly delivered via mobile phones in video/audio formats
that illiterate women can easily understand.
Women used the MatHealth app to share maternal
health-related videos and audios with their spouses. In
particular, the app’s video that demonstrates the need
for spouses to take an active role in maternal and childhealth motivated spouses to provide pregnancy-relatedsupport such as escorting women to the clinic, provid-
ing nutritional and feeding support, purchasing essen-
tials required for delivery, as well as providingtransport and permission to the clinic for antenatal
services, delivery, and postnatal services. Although
not necessarily mobile phone-assisted, evidence sug-gests that spouse involvement can improve maternal
health outcomes in developing countries,
25where
most men are key decision makers and providers intheir families.
26Mobile phone-based SMS texting is
associated with utilization of maternal health services
in Uganda.27Since the majority of women could read
Runyankole (local language), SMS texts in local lan-guage could potentially be used as alternative
approaches to disseminate maternal and child health
information to these women. Although they are notas interactive as videos and audios, their compatibility
with feature phones makes them more affordable in
this low resource setting. However, studies utilizingSMS texts to support maternal and child healthamong rural, poor, and illiterate women are generally
lacking. Such studies can potentially reach populationsthat would otherwise be hard to reach by traditional
face-to-face approaches which often involve huge
transport costs and significant time commitments.
Through the reminder function of the MatHealth
app, participants got reminded of their clinic appoint-
ment dates, which resulted in adherence to antenataland postnatal appointments. This could potentially
improve maternal and child health.
28The utility of
adhering to clinic appointment as a result of usingthe app could address the current gaps between the
number of antenatal visits recommended by WHO,
and the current practices in Uganda. Only 58% ofwomen from rural areas attend the four antenatalvisits previously recommended by WHO.
12(currently
recommends eight visits). Associating the use of the
app with adherence to antenatal appointment is partic-ularly important given the evidence that compared to
educated women (72%), few illiterate women (53%)
attend the recommended four antenatal visits.
12
The calling function enabled women call a maternal
health specialist (gynecologist) whose number was
included in the application. This helped women makeimportant inquiries about their pregnancies includingasking for more information in case they needed more
clarifications in the video/audio contents, as well as
inquiring about suspected pregnancy danger signs.Rather than physical meetings, mobile telephone-
based communication is time and cost saving since
there are no physical movements involved. Thisapproach could also give women confidence to inquire
about sensitive issues that they would otherwise not be
confident to talk about face-to-face at the facility.Information communication technologies are reportedto facilitate confidential sharing of sexual health infor-
mation in the same setting.
16Using mobile telephone-
based communication approaches could supplementthe existing face-to-face approaches that have long
been criticized for being unfriendly
29—subject to
unkind words, refusing to attend to pregnant womenwhen they reach late at health facilities
10in low
resource settings.
Despite the identified benefits of using the
MatHealth app to support maternal and child health,
the reported financial challenges limited the function-
ality of the application. Providing educational videos/audios, appointment reminders, and the calling func-tion is not sufficient if there is no money to purchase
nutritional supplements required by pregnant/breast
feeding women, transport women to the clinic for ante-natal/postnatal appointments, buy air time to call and
consult a maternal health specialist, or/and afford
potential out of pocked medical expenses. Sellingstudy phones by some women in order to meet theMusiimenta et al. 7basic needs of life suggest the need to incorporate eco-
nomic interventions to enable women overcome theidentified financial challenges while addressing poverty
as the root cause poor maternal and child health out-
comes. Although studies utilizing economic interven-tions to support maternal and child health, especially
in low resource settings are rare, the modest existing
ones demonstrate promising results in improving accessto maternal and child health services in Uganda.
30,31
Despite the promising results, the impact of these stud-ies is limited by providing incentives face-to-face; theyare thus restricted by geographical boundaries, are timeconsuming, and involve transport costs. Alternatively,
mobile services could be used to provide financial sup-
port. Indeed, use of “mobile money” (money accessedthrough mobile phones) services is nearly ubiquitous in
Uganda, and has provided access to financial transac-
tions to people that were otherwise unreached by con-ventional banks.
A few technological issues limited the feasibility of
the application. Some participants lacked electricity tocharge their phones, others shared their phones espe-
cially with their spouses, while others changed their
phone numbers. In Uganda, many people in ruralareas still lack access to electricity.
32Providing compat-
ible solar chargers could address this challenge. To
make it more affordable, a few solar charges could be
put to designated charging stations where participantscould charge their phones. Sharing mobile phones in
this population is not uncommon.
14Women’s practice
of giving spouses control over their phones might be areflection of the prevailing gender imbalances in this
setting. Phone sharing could be minimized if spouses
are oriented about the need for their wives to have fulltime access to the study phones. For participants whosephone numbers were unreachable, it is not clear wheth-
er they changed the phone numbers deliberately—even
after being assured that they will remain with themobile phones after study, some of these participants
could not imagine being given free smart phones in this
low resource setting, so they could have changed theirtelephone numbers so that the study team could not
reach them. This could have been minimized by incor-
porating a run-in period for a couple of weeks prior torandomization. The run-in period could contain partic-ular study-related activities that prospective partici-
pants must adhere to before randomization. The
compulsory run-in activities could include brainstorm-ing sessions to discuss appropriate contents for the
video/audio messages, as well as issues of application
usability. This approach minimizes dropouts after ran-domization by identifying participants who are likely to
honestly take up the intervention.

The main strength of this study is that it identifies
important insights about the experiences of illiteraterural women in using a mobile multimedia application
to support maternal health in a sub-Saharan Africansetting. Findings has implications for similar settings.
However, results may have limited generalizability
since they are based on responses of 30 participantsthat used the MatHealth app and were followed-upfor six months. It is not clear how they manifestin larger, diverse contexts, and with longer-termfollow-up.
In conclusion, we found that the mobile multimedia
application (composed of educational video/audio mes-sages, appointment reminders and calling function) tosupport maternal health in rural illiterate women was
largely acceptable and feasible in a research context
within a low resourced setting. The application wasbeneficial in enhancing the adoption good maternaland child health practices such as exclusive breastfeed-ing and adherence to antenatal appointments. It alsoenhanced spouse support and involvement, and facili-
tated communication with healthcare providers. The
analysis of data to assess the impact of the app onmaternal health outcomes (e.g. adherence to prenataland postnatal clinic appointments) is on-going and willbe reported in a separate paper. Future efforts shouldfocus on optimized application design (e.g. making theappointment setting function more user-friendly,
including a functionality that detects application
usage), spouse orientation/gender considerations,incorporating economic support, as well as organizingpre-randomization run-in sessions to overcome thechallenges we encountered.
