Abstr act
Backgr ound: In resource-poor settings, lack of awareness and low demand for services constitute important barriers to expanding
the coverage of effective interv entions. In India, childhood immunization is a priority health strate gy with suboptimal uptak e.
Objecti ve: To assess study feasibility and key implementation outcomes for the Tika Vaani model, a new approach to educate
and empo wer benef iciaries to impro ve immunization and child health.
Methods: A cluster -randomized pilot trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio was conducted in rural Uttar Pradesh, India, from January
to September 2018. Villages were randomly assigned to either the interv ention or control group. In each participating village,
surveyors conducted a complete enumeration to identify eligible households and requested participation before randomization.
Interv entions were designed through formati ve research using a social mark eting approach and delivered over 3 months using
strate gies adapted to disadv antaged populations: (1) mobile health (mHealth): entertaining educational audio capsules (edutainment)
and voice immunization reminders via mobile phone and (2) face-to-f ace: community mobilization activities, including 3 small
group meetings offered to each participant. The control group recei ved usual services. The main outcomes were prespecif ied
criteria for feasibility of the main study (recruitment, randomization, retention, contamination, and adoption). Secondary endpoints
tested equity of coverage and changes in intermediate outcomes. Statistical methods included descripti ve statistics to assess
feasibility , penalized logistic regression and ordered logistic regression to assess coverage, and generalized estimating equation
models to assess changes in intermediate outcomes.
Results: All villages consented to participate. Gaps in administrati ve data hampered recruitment; 14.0% (79/565) of recorded
households were nonresident. Only 1.4% (8/565) of households did not consent. A total of 387 households (184 interv ention and
203 control) with children aged 0 to 12 months in 26 villages (13 interv ention and 13 control) were included and randomized.
The end line survey occurred during the flood season; 17.6% (68/387) of the households were absent. Contamination was less
than 1%. Participation in one or more interv entions was 94.0% (173/184), 78.3% (144/184) for the face-to-f ace strate gy, and

RenderX67.4% (124/184) for the mHealth strate gy. Determinants including place of residence, mobile phone access, education, and female
empo werment shaped interv ention use; factors operated differently for face-to-f ace and mHealth strate gies. For 11 of 13 intermediate
outcomes, regression results showed signif icantly higher basic health knowledge among the interv ention group, supporting
hypothesized causal mechanisms.
Conclusions: A future trial of a new interv ention model is feasible. The interv entions could strengthen the delivery of
immunization and universal primary health care. Social and behavior change communication via mobile phones proved viable
and contrib uted to standardization and scalability . Face-to-f ace interactions remain necessary to achie ve equity and reach,
suggesting the need for ongoing health system strengthening to accompan y the introduction of communication technologies.

Introduction
Backgr ound and Rationale
Expanding coverage of effective interv entions is a critical
challenge for many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
In addition to technical impro vements in service delivery,
impro ving coverage often hinges critically on enhanced
awareness and demand for services on the part of benef iciaries.
Furthermore, in settings of low literac y, deep poverty, and poor
access to information, behavior change is extremely challenging.
Immunization is a priority health strate gy for LMIC polic y
makers seeking to advance the 2030 United Nations (UN)
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) due to its inherent
value in reducing the burden of disease and its potential role as
a lever for health system strengthening. Immunization reaches
more households than any other health service, bringing
communities into regular contact with the health system [1].
The immunization platform can potentially be used to strengthen
the delivery of universal primary health care, universal health
coverage, and meet other SDG targets [1]. This approach may
be particularly salient in areas where vaccination delivery
systems function reliably , but important gaps exist in the
delivery of other health services. In these conte xts, increasing
immunization coverage offers a potential pathw ay to expand
the range and reach of health services and to advance a holistic
health agenda.
In India, the government has prioritized immunization, making
remarkable gains in recent years. However, coverage continues
to fall short of the target to fully immunize 90% of India’ s
infants against 7 vaccine-pre ventable diseases by 2020 [2].
Nevertheless, immunization delivery now outperforms other
services, offering a potential lever for system strengthening. In
rural north India, for example, research shows that high-priority
primary care interv entions, including vaccination, are being
delivered quite well, whereas other basic health promotion and
prevention services are largely not provided, constituting a
critical missed opportunity for population health [3]. On the
basis of analysis of Indian immunization program data,
achie ving and sustaining vaccine coverage targets especially
requires new strate gies to address gaps in benef iciary demand[2]. Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have
demonstrated that knowledge translation and education
strate gies, such as those offering education at village meetings
or at home, are likely to impro ve vaccination coverage [4,5].
However, strate gies based on face-to-f ace communication may
be challenging to standardize and deliver at scale.
The widespread availability of mobile phones in LMICs has
stimulated interest in the potential of mobile health (mHealth)
interv entions to achie ve health objecti ves. A recent systematic
review found that mHealth interv entions can impro ve maternal
and neonatal service delivery and that text-based vaccination
reminders are associated with impro ved vaccination coverage
[6]. Although their potential for scalability at low cost is
attracti ve, whether mHealth interv entions can be effective for
highly disadv antaged populations facing substantial barriers
due to poverty, low literac y, and gender norms is uncertain.
Goal of This Study
We developed the Tika Vaani (vaccine voice in Hindi) model
to educate benef iciaries about immunization and basic child
health themes, dispel misinformation, and empo wer households
to better care for their children and themselv es. A key
distinguishing feature of the model is that it integrates an
mHealth component to increase standardization and scalability
of social and behavior change communication. The interv entions
were delivered through small face-to-f ace meetings and via
mobile phone using strate gies (conte xt-appropriate audio
messages delivered via automated phone calls) adapted to
disadv antaged populations. We conducted a pilot randomized
controlled trial (RCT) applying an implementation research lens
to inform a future large-scale RCT. This paper presents the main
(quantitati ve) evaluation of the pilot trial focusing on two
objecti ves: (1) to assess the feasibility of processes critical to
the success of the main study (recruitment, randomization,
retention, and contamination) and interv ention uptak e (adoption)
and (2) to study key implementation outcomes to optimize
successful delivery of the interv entions at scale [7]. Objecti ves
pertained to cluster and individual levels. A companion paper
presents findings related to interv ention fidelity , acceptability ,
and appropriateness using mixed (qualitati ve and quantitati ve)
methods (Pérez et al, unpublished data, 2020).

Trial Design
In keeping with the plan for the main study , this pilot study
adopted a cluster -randomized design with a 1:1 allocation ratio.
A cluster design was chosen owing to the nature of the study
interv entions: face-to-f ace interv entions are structured around
communities rather than individuals, whereas mHealth
interv entions have a possibility of contamination. Clusters were
rural villages in a district of Uttar Pradesh (UP), India. Villages
were randomly assigned to either the interv ention or control
group (CG). The protocol was registered in a WHO International
Clinical Trials Registry Platform-compliant registry
(ISRCTN44840759 doi.or g/10.1186/ISRCTN44840759). There
were no important changes to methods after trial
commencement. We originally sought to register the trial in the
Clinical Trials Registry–India (CTRI), which is free of charge
and has as the mission to enroll all clinical trials conducted in
India. The CTRI took several months to follow-up; in the
interim, we applied to a different registry . Owing to the delay
caused by waiting and changing registries, the trial was
registered shortly after patient enrollment was completed.
Participants
Setting and Location
India’ s most populous state of over 200 million residents, UP
is an area of national focus due to lagging health and
development indicators. Hardoi (population 4 million; under -5
mortality rate 118 per 1000; cf. UP under -5 mortality rate 90
per 1000, India under -5 mortality rate 57.3 per 1000) [8,9]) is
a low-performing, rural district within UP comprising 19
administrati ve blocks. Thanks to recent Government of India
(GoI) initiati ves, the proportion of fully immunized children
aged between 12 and 23 months in Hardoi district rose from
26.5% in 2007-2008 [10] to an estimated 65.9% (95% CI
62.0%-69.8%) in 2018 when this study was conducted [2]. A
single administrati ve block of the Hardoi district was selected
for this pilot based on criteria reflecting logistics and needs.
Eligibility Criteria
Villages (clusters) were eligible for inclusion if they had less
than 4000 inhabitants and were located in Bawan Block, Hardoi,
UP. In participating villages, interv entions were offered to all
residents. Participants in the baseline survey were consenting
primary caregivers of children aged between 0 and 12 months
residing in a study village. We excluded those who were not
able to understand and speak Hindi or Urdu or those who did
not intend to reside in the village for the study duration (6
months). The same individuals were approached for the end
line survey.
The survey sampling unit was the household. We conducted a
door-to-door census of the village and cross-check ed
administrati ve records from the Anganwadi workers (AWW)
and Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) to identify all
households containing a child in the age range of 0 to 12 months
within each village. These households constituted our primary
target group.Inter ventions
Formativ e Researc h
From January 1, 2017, to January 10, 2018, we conducted
formati ve research using a social mark eting approach to inform
interv ention design [11]. An iterati ve, participatory approach
involving cocreation was favored to validate the need for the
interv entions, to make the interv entions more compelling and
linguistically and culturally appropriate, and to tailor approaches
to different user segments [11]. Content was designed by Gram
Vaani, an Indian social enterprise specializing in community
media platforms for low-literac y rural populations, and Jagriti,
a local NGO. Content fostered equity , empo werment, and social
inclusion through positi ve portrayals of diverse characters.
Technical experts assured information quality , including
members of the research team and India’ s Ministry of Health
and Family Welfare [11]. Extensi ve adaptations to interv entions
were made to meet target population needs during the formati ve
research phase [12]. During the pilot RCT, all interv ention
components were frozen for evaluation, and deviations to
interv ention fidelity were systematically monitored (Pérez et
al, unpublished data, 2020.
Pilot RCT
The study interv entions took place over a 3-month period and
offered social and behavior change communication (SBCC) for
members of the general public in rural Indian villages,
addressing topics related to child health. The primary target
group was families residing in a selected village with a child in
the age range of 0 to 12 months. Although vaccination was the
primary focus of the study , the SBCC interv entions addressed
additional areas stipulated to be co-deli vered with immunization
during Village Health and Nutrition Days (VHNDs), such as
health education related to health care entitlements; prevention,
recognition, and management of common infectious diseases
(diarrhea, pneumonia, dengue, and chikungun ya); nutrition; and
water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH).
SBCC materials were delivered through 2 channels: (1)
mHealth: educational audio capsules in entertaining formats
(edutainment) and voice reminders for immunization sessions
broadcast via mobile phone and (2) face-to-f ace: community
mobilization activities, consisting of 1 large introductory
meeting to introduce the project to communities and 3 small
meetings offered to each participant covering specif ic themes.
For the mHealth component, push messages (automated dial
outs) and voice-based reminders were privileged owing to low
education level and comfort with technology . For the
face-to-f ace component, small group meetings were held
separately for men and women and in different geographical
locations within villages to ensure ease of communication.
mHealth vaccination reminders were based on the child’ s
birthdate and offered only to the target group; however, other
interv entions (mHealth edutainment and face-to-f ace meetings)
were open to all village residents. Community workers (AWW
and ASHAs) were encouraged to participate and recei ved
advance access to interv ention materials. All interv entions were
free of charge to end users. The CG recei ved standard GoI health
and welfare services.

RenderXThe mHealth strate gy (Tika Vaani SBCC Version 1.5, released
on July 7, 2017) was designed and delivered by Gram Vaani,
a social tech startup incubated out of the Indian Institute of
Technology Delhi, using the Mobile Vaani Interacti ve Voice
Response System. Access was free and open to anyone who
called the number . The participants could give a missed call to
access the platform, and as a result recei ve a callback enabling
them to access all content, record any queries or feedback, or
be connected to a live expert. To simplify access, consenting
households in interv ention villages with children aged less than
12 months at baseline recei ved automated outbound calls twice
per week. In total, 26 content pieces were offered. In addition,
child vaccination reminders were sent to target grouphouseholds. Small group meetings lasting approximately 1 hour
involving 2 trained facilitators with a minimum of 12 years of
education were held once per month and open to all village
residents. The access number was shared at each meeting. A
video describing Mobile Vaani is available [13]. Additional
information relevant to scale up and replication of the Tika
Vaani system is available [11] and content is accessible [14].
A comprehensi ve interv ention description is provided in
Multimedia Appendix 1[15]. The evaluation was conducted
by a team of academic specialists distinct from the developers.

As health interv entions must achie ve sufficient uptak e to impact
population health, we also established minimum criteria for
participation in the new interv entions.
Secondary Outcomes
We present quantitati ve findings for 2 secondary outcomes: (1)

We constructed a logic model describing the hypothesized
program impact pathw ay and mechanisms of action (Figure 1)
and adapted an established vaccination communication
taxonomy to define indicators [17]. We compared treatment
groups on outputs (intermediate outcomes, such as knowledge
and attitudes) related to the interv ention theory of change.

Data Sour ces
Quantitati ve data were collected from the following sources:
•Face-to-f ace surveys: Intervie wer-administered household
surveys were conducted in all participating study villages.
Surveys were administered at baseline before random group
assignment and approximately 5 months later following
interv entions at end line.
•Project administrati ve records: Standardized forms to assess
delivery of study procedures and interv entions were
maintained by field staff to facilitate structured observ ation
and data capture.
•Interacti ve voice response (IVR) system: The IVR system
automatically recorded all calls to the platform. IVR data
can be disaggre gated by various fields including caller
phone number , date, time, frequenc y, duration (seconds),
call type, content type, and user characteristics. IVR data
were linked to phone numbers provided by target
households during the baseline survey to map calls sent
and/or recei ved.Variables
We measured the use of the IVR through the number and
duration of calls from a unique phone number . We considered
that an mHealth item was received if the caller remained
connected for 80% or more of the item duration. Contamination
was defined as the proportion of calls originating from control
villages and assessed using 2 data sources: (1) the IVR system
to identify unkno wn numbers and trace nonre gistered callers to
identify call origin and (2) questions were included about
interv ention use in the end line survey administered to the
treatment and CGs (Multimedia Appendix 1). To construct
wealth quintiles, we performed principal component analysis
to create a relati ve index of household wealth from a list of
assets used in major household surveys [10,18]. We used this
index to divide the sample into quintiles [19]. A similar approach
was used to construct women’ s empo werment terciles. Caste
was represented in 4 categories (general, other backw ard caste,
scheduled caste, or scheduled tribe) ranging from most to least
advantaged, as for Indian national surveys. By convention, caste
categories are applied to all population groups, irrespecti ve of
religion. For interv ention group (IG) households only,
implementation teams assessed whether households were able

RenderXto attend small group meetings based on geographical distance
from their place of residence to anticipated meeting sites. This
categorization was made at the study baseline, before
undertaking interv entions.
Sample Size
Although the pilot was a cluster -randomized two-group study ,
the study size was based on the rate of contamination among
controls. We estimated the required sample size needed for the
CG using methods for a one-group descripti ve study . We
assumed that the true proportion of contamination (calls
originating from controls) was 10%, that contamination was
most likely to arise from parents of young children, and that
there would be 20 households with children aged less than 12
months per village. On the basis of these inputs and using a
binomial (exact) calculation, we would require 200 households
in the CG to detect a 95% confidence interv al of 6.2% to 15.0%
[20]. The total sample size for the pilot was therefore set at
double this number or 400 households.
Village Selection
The sampling frame was informed by the 2011 census [21],
which indicated that the Bawan Block had a total population of
approximately 234,000, including 217,000 rural residents
distrib uted among 143 villages. We eliminated 3 urban villages,
11 villages with a population exceeding 4000, 15 villages
recorded as having 0 population, and 57 villages in which we
had previously worked (so as to gain experience in a
treatment-naï ve population). This left a sampling frame of 57
villages, from which an initial 20 villages were randomly
selected using Microsoft Excel. The number of children in the
target age range per village was not known in advance of the
baseline survey. As villages vary in size, to attain our sample
size target, we decided a priori that (1) any village with more
than 1 but less than 10 children in the target age range would
be retained and another randomly selected village would also
be added and (2) villages with no children in the target age range
would be dropped.
Randomization
Sequence Generation and Allocation Concealment
Villages were assigned to either interv ention or control using
simple randomization with a 1:1 allocation following a
computer -generated randomization schedule. The random
allocation sequence was generated at the Centre de recherche
du Centre hospitalier de l’Uni versité de Montréal by a
professional statistician (MPS) using commands for random
samples and permutations in the R environment for statistical
computing [22] and kept in a passw ord-protected computer .
The statistician was not involved in study implementation.
Before the release of the randomization code, only the
statistician had access to the allocation sequence. Randomization
code was released all at once, and treatment groups were
assigned only after completing all recruitment procedures and
baseline measurements.
Implementation
Field team leaders enrolled clusters by contacting village
officials in person to explain study aims and activities andrequest consent to participate. Subsequently , in each
participating village, surveyors conducted a complete
enumeration to identify all households with children in the target
age range and directly approached all such households to request
participation in the baseline survey and pilot study . Consent
was sought before randomization. No advertisements were used
for recruitment, and no incenti ves or rewards were offered for
participation. Surveyors communicated group assignments
personally to households.
Blinding
Due to the nature of the interv entions, neither participants nor
those delivering interv entions were blinded to the group
assignment. We hired independent surveyors at end line to assess
study outcomes. These surveyors were not informed about study
aims or group assignments.
Statistical Methods
Descriptiv e Analyses
We used counts, frequencies, and proportions to summarize
categorical data, and means and standard deviations for
continuous variables. We assessed bivariate associations using
univariable logistic regression for continuous variables and the
chi-square test for categorical variables.
Multivariable Analyses
Coverage
We studied the degree to which target benef iciaries (IG
households with a child aged less than 12 months at baseline)
recei ved the interv entions.
To investigate patterns of uptak e, we developed separate models
for each interv ention component: immunization reminders
(mHealth), edutainment capsules (mHealth), and small group
meetings (face-to-f ace). Outcomes were modeled as binary (0
uptak e vs 1 or more instances of uptak e). We followed guidance
for the use of logistic regression in small data sets [23,24]. To
identify candidate predictors of uptak e and use, we developed
a conceptual frame work informed by the scientif ic literature
and expert knowledge (Multimedia Appendix 1). The conceptual
frame work considered socioeconomic determinants, physical
and infrastructure barriers, access barriers related to mobile
phone use within households, and women’ s empo werment.
Together , these variables represented 17 degrees of freedom.
To develop the full models for implementation, we empirically
refined the choice of variables to respect a minimum of roughly
10 events per variable for accurate prediction of binary outcomes
[23]. Specif ically , we excluded candidate variables if the
bivariate chi-square test showed no relationship between
predictor and outcome at the level of P<.25. We fit full statistical
models using the Firth (penalized maximum likelihood) logistic
regression to avoid overfitting [23] and handle data separation.
The final models were fit within a cluster bootstrap algorithm
(1000 iterations).
To study the determinants of intensity of participation, we
repeated analyses specifying ordered logistic regression models
for 2 outcomes: (1) the number of mHealth items heard and (2)
the number of small group meetings attended. We tested the

RenderXproportional odds assumption using an approximate likelihood
ratio test [25]. All models used robust standard errors to account
for clustering.
Adequacy of the Program Theory
We studied interv ention impact on intermediate outcomes using
generalized estimating equations (GEE): (1) we used the
differences-in-dif ferences method to study changes in variables
measuring immunization knowledge in the 2 study groups
between the baseline survey and the end line survey using
unadjusted regression coefficients (with their 95% CIs) for the
interaction between group (interv ention or control) and time
period (end line or baseline) [26]. (2) To assess knowledge of
other basic health topics (assessed only at study end line), we
estimated the probability of correct responses at the end line
among those recei ving the interv ention (vs controls). All GEE
models estimated binary outcomes with an exchangeable
correlation structure adjusted for village-le vel clustering and
robust standard errors. We ran crude models and models
adjusted for unbalanced variables following randomization and
prespecif ied potential confounders.
Feasibility outcomes were assessed using the intention-to-treat
(ITT) sample; no clusters and no participants were excluded.
Analyses of interv ention uptak e and coverage used the ITT IG;
no clusters and no participants randomized to the IG were
excluded. To assess the program theory , we analyzed
intermediate outcomes using the sample that participated at both
baseline and end line, for which 0 clusters, 68 households, and
69 caregivers were lost to follow-up, which is equivalent to an
observ ational sample. For 2 households, missing data on caste
were imputed based on the locality of residence within the
village. There were no other missing data. Analyses were
conducted in Stata 15 (Stata Corporation).Resear ch Ethics and Informed Consent

(29/29) consented to participate. Recruitment of individual
participants was complicated by gaps in administrati ve data, as
13.9% (79/565) of recorded households were in fact nonresident.
Only 1.4% (8/565) of the candidate households did not consent
to participate. A total of 391 (185 IGand 206 CG) caregivers
of children aged 0 to 12 months in 387 (184 IG and 203 CG)
households in 26 (13 IG and 13 CG) villages were included in
the study (Figure 2). Interv entions were delivered from March
21 to July 9, 2018. The end line survey took place from July 17
to August 20, 2018, during the annual monsoon floods. Many
households (17.6%, 68/387) were absent during the study end
line; loss to follow-up was non-dif ferential (31 IG and 37 CG).
The trial ended when planned activities were successfully
completed; Figure 2describes the progress of participants
through the trial.
Characteristics of the participating individuals (Table 2) and
villages (Table 3) were similar across treatment groups at
baseline. The CG was advantaged in terms of assets (wealth
quintiles) and cell phone netw ork quality .

Primary Outcomes
Ex-ante criteria were fully satisf ied (Table 4). Results from 2
independent sources demonstrated a very low (1% or less) rate
of contamination (Table 4; Multimedia Appendix 1). Uptak e
of interv entions (adoption) was very high; overall participation
in one or more new interv entions was 94.0% (173/184), 78.3%(144/184) for the face-to-f ace channel, and 67.4% (124/184)
for the mHealth channel (Table 4). A total of 38.0% (70/184)
of participating households used the mHealth interv ention
weekly . Together , these results confirm the feasibility of the
future main study and demonstrate the potential to impact
population health.

Secondary Outcomes
Coverage
Uptak e of the 3 interv ention channels (mHealth vaccination
reminders, mHealth edutainment capsules, and face-to-f ace
small group meetings) differed among user segments (Tables
5and 6present modeled results; Supplementary Table 1
provides bivariate associations).
The ownership of a mobile phone was common among IG
households (173/184, 94.0%) and a critical precondition for
uptak e of both mHealth strate gies. Owing to the very few (n=11)
households without a mobile phone and the prognostic
importance of this variable, effect size estimates for mobile
phone ownership are unreliable. However, estimates for other
variables are, in principle, unbiased:
•mHealth audio vaccination reminders were accessed by
62.5% (115/184) of households. In addition to mobile phone
ownership, 2 factors predicted higher uptak e: high maternal
education (secondary 9 years or higher vs none; OR 4.45,
95% CI 1.17-16.88; P=.03) and mothers’ ease of access to
the mobile phone (OR 3.55, 95% CI 1.08-11.71; P=.04).•mHealth edutainment capsules were accessed by 60.3%
(111/184) of households. In addition to mobile phone
ownership, interv ention uptak e was predicted by high (as
compared with low) women’ s empo werment (OR 3.29,
95% CI 1.28-8.47; P=.01), with some evidence of greater
uptak e by the lowest castes (members of scheduled castes
vs general castes; OR 2.79, 95% CI 0.95-8.21; P=.06).
However, poor phone netw ork quality impeded the uptak e
of edutainment capsules (OR 0.29, 95% CI
0.12-0.71; P=.01).
•Face-to-f ace small group meetings were attended by 78.3%
(144/184) of households. Living far from the meeting site
reduced the uptak e of small meetings (OR 0.07, 95% CI
0.02-0.33; P<.001); no other factor predicted uptak e.
We also studied factors shaping the intensity of uptak e. In
modeled analyses, the number of mHealth items heard was
influenced by 3 factors: mother’ s possession of a mobile phone,
mother’ s ease of phone access, and women’ s empo werment.
The number of small group meetings attended was influenced
by 2 factors: living far from the meeting site and women’ s
empo werment (Multimedia Appendix 1).

Adequacy of the Program Theory
Immunization knowledge was low at baseline in both study
groups. For 3 of the 4 indicators studied, knowledge impro ved
in the IG at end line (Table 7). Differences-in-dif ferences
estimates of impact suggest that observ ed impro vements were
owing to the study interv entions (Table 8). Effect sizes increased
after adjustment for baseline imbalances.For 8 of 9 intermediate outcomes, the regression results showed
signif icantly higher basic health knowledge among the IG at
end line (Table 9). For one topic (whether subjects had heard
of diarrhea), knowledge at end line was equal for both treatment
groups (P=.44). This was likely owing to an independent
immunization and hygiene interv ention in the study area run
by the Gavi Alliance and Unile ver.

Discussion
Principal Findings
We conducted a pilot trial of SBCC interv entions focusing on
immunization and other basic themes important for child and
family health. Interv entions were delivered through small
face-to-f ace meetings and via mobile phones using pushed audio
messages and other strate gies suitable for disadv antaged
populations. The pilot trial aimed to assess the feasibility of a
future planned main study and to draw lessons to optimize
delivery of the interv entions at scale.
This paper offers 4 salient findings: First, all ex-ante feasibility
criteria related to recruitment, randomization, retention, and
contamination were satisf ied, providing compelling evidence
that the planned future main trial is feasible as planned. Uptak e
of interv entions (adoption) was near universal (50% ex-ante vs
94% in practice), demonstrating strong interest and acceptability .
Second, analyses of uptak e and use demonstrated that
interv ention use was shaped by social determinants but that the
chosen combination of strate gies reached all population groups,
even the most vulnerable. Third, constellations of determinants
differed by interv ention delivery channel. Ownership of a mobile
phone was critical for participation in mHealth (vaccination
reminders and edutainment) interv entions, whereas distance
from place of residence to the meeting site was important for
small group meetings. mHealth vaccination reminders were
taken up preferentially by more educated women and those with
easy phone access within the household, whereas mHealth
edutainment capsules were favored by more empo wered women
and by lower caste groups, for whom the content was likely
novel and useful. Face-to-f ace meetings were the most equitable
interv ention channel; participation was equal or higher among
those with greater needs. Women’ s empo werment was animportant transv ersal determinant, increasing uptak e and
intensity for all interv entions. Fourth, we found that the study
interv entions lead to measurable impro vements in basic health
knowledge, supporting the potential for impact at scale. Changes
in intermediate outcomes are consistent with the interv ention
theory of change.
Limitations
At least five important caveats should also be considered. First,
an important potential bias relevant for the future definitive trial
relates to vaccination coverage assessment. As documented in
our pilot study and elsewhere, the population denominator used
in administrati ve estimates is often inaccurate (and the reported
number of doses unreliable) [27]. Although household surveys
are considered superior , they are also affected by seasonal and
chance variations and do not shed light directly on population
immunity gaps. Impro vements in vaccination coverage
assessment methods would strengthen the ability of the main
trial to assess immunization program performance. Second,
those delivering and receiving interv entions could not be blinded
due to the nature of the interv entions. We attempted to limit
potential bias due to lack of blinding by hiring independent
outcome assessors unaware of study purpose and group
assignment, using indicators based on objecti ve measures where
possible, and triangulating between multiple measures and data
sources to strengthen inference. Third, although interv entions
were able to achie ve widespread reach in highly disadv antaged
populations to ensure equity and impact, these findings are
limited by the relati vely small size of the IG. Fourth, quality of
interv ention delivery may be more difficult to achie ve in a
routine care setting. The personnel delivering the RCT
interv entions were highly motivated, well trained, and closely
supervised. It may be difficult to maintain delivery quality at
scale, particularly for face-to-f ace components. Fifth, the pilot
study duration was too short (and sample size was too small)

RenderXto assess definitive changes in health outcomes. Future research
is required to demonstrate whether these gains in health
knowledge result in impro ved vaccination coverage and child
health.
Generalizability
We highlight 3 insights relevant to the future definitive trial and
other studies: The first relates to adapting mHealth interv entions
for highly disadv antaged populations. In rural India, mobile
phone penetration and infrastructure is increasing rapidly ,
reducing barriers to delivering mHealth interv entions. Our
experience demonstrates that mHealth interv entions can achie ve
reach and impro ve knowledge even in highly underpri vileged
populations, but that technical delivery and content must be
substantially adapted. Although mHealth interv entions using
SMS have shown promise [6], we privileged audio messages
with pushed dial outs owing to the low literac y, numerac y, and
technological comfort levels of our target benef iciaries. We
found that engaging story formats inclusi ve of diverse social
groups were appreciated and that pure informational approaches
such as vaccination reminders were taken up preferentially by
the (relati ve) elite. As compared with SMS, audio messaging
is more amenable to culture-specif ic conte xtualization and an
edutainment approach. The second insight concerns how
gender -related barriers shape immunization access [28] and
affected the study interv entions. Participation in mobile phone
interv entions was limited by women’ s ease of access to mobile
phones, and, to a lesser degree, with technological familiarity .
Participation in face-to-f ace meetings was limited by norms
governing women’ s freedom of movement. Barriers were
mitig ated over time as families came to understand and valuethe interv entions (Pérez et al, unpublished data, 2020).
Unexpectedly , men, particularly fathers, were highly active
participants. Future interv entions should include a focus on men
and families to strengthen inclusion and mitig ate gender barriers.
The third insight concerns the complementarity of mHealth and
face-to-f ace communication: Although mHealth audio
messaging is a promising strate gy to deliver basic health
information, our experience shows that it must be accompanied
by face-to-f ace contact to enhance uptak e [29] and equity . An
mHealth strate gy can extend the reach of face-to-f ace
communication at high fidelity and low cost. Particularly among
vulnerable populations, it is unlik ely to fully replace in-person
interaction. Future research exploring innovative delivery
modalities while considering potential trade-of fs between equity
and efficienc y (cost-ef fectiveness) is recommended.
Conclusions
A novel SBCC interv ention model using face-to-f ace and
mHealth approaches is feasible to evaluate in a future
randomized trial and has the potential to strengthen the delivery
of immunization and universal primary health care. The
interv entions achie ved widespread reach in a highly
disadv antaged population and showed early evidence of impact
on participants’ knowledge, supporting the interv ention theory
of change. Beha vior change communication via mobile phones
proved viable and contrib uted to standardization and scalability .
Face-to-f ace interactions remain necessary to achie ve equity
and reach, suggesting the need for ongoing health system
strengthening to accompan y the introduction of promising
mobile phone technologies.
