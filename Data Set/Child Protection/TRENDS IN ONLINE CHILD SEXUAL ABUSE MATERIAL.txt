CSAM crimes are varied and subject to 
change, terminology differs across researchers 
and practitioners, and inconsistent ways of 
operationalising and measuring CSAM make 
comparison across studies difficult. This has had a 
negative impact on global efforts at data collection 
across different forms of child sexual abuse and 
exploitation and is the case with online CSAM.
Our capacity to evaluate the scale of the problem in 
terms of the quantity of CSAM is compromised by 
the volume of online content in the open, and also 
hidden, Internet and the reality that content may be 
removed but not destroyed.
Criminal justice data from public records, as well 
as research surveys, would suggest an increase 
over time in the number of CSAM crimes. 
Youth-produced images pose a problem for law 
enforcement in terms of resource demands 
alongside their ability to determine the age of the 
child and whether they have been produced as part 
of coercive activity by adults or peers or represent 
behaviour that is consistent with adolescent 
development and risk-taking. 
Mapping of existing national and international CSAM 
databases would suggest that they fall largely into 
two groups: hash collections and image collections. 
While there are a number of databases globally, there is limited connectivity between them. 
Differences in how data is defined and recorded 
means that it is impossible to draw firm conclusions 
as to whether there have been changes in the 
gender, age and level of violence within recorded 
CSAM. However there is some converging evidence 
that the percentage of egregious images has 
increased over time. 
Across three studies, younger victims are associated 
with greater levels of sexual violence, produced 
within a family context and more likely to be widely 
distributed. However, the preponderance of images 
are of pubescent and pre-pubescent children and 
the numbers of images of very young children 
(infants and toddlers) remain relatively low. This is in 
contrast to the views of experts interviewed in the 
current study.
The majority of victims and offenders are white 
Caucasians, and while there has been an increase 
in other ethnic groups, these numbers remain 
disproportionately small. This does require further 
investigation given the increasing availability of 
Internet connectivity through hand-held devices 
across hand-held devices and the concerns 
expressed about, for example, live streaming of 
abuse. TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL6Definitions of what constitutes online-facilitated 
child sexual abuse and exploitation are both varied 
and subject to change, and as noted by a recent 
study,1 the terms used in research are often different 
from those used for legally defined crimes, which 
also differ between, and on occasions within, 
countries. Differing terminology makes comparison 
across studies difficult, and this is reflected in the 
decision by ECPAT International to work with other 
stakeholders to develop terminology guidelines, 
as absence of consensus about the terms used 
has had a negative impact on global efforts at data 
collection across different forms of child sexual 
abuse and exploitation.2 These forms may include: 
the production, dissemination and possession of 
child sexual abuse material (CSAM: which are known 
in many jurisdictions as ‘child pornography’); online 
grooming or active sexual solicitation of children; 
sexting; sexual extortion of children (also known 
as ‘sextortion’); revenge pornography; exploitation 
of children through online prostitution, and live 
streaming of sexual abuse.3 We can also make a 
distinction between cyber-enabled and cyber-
dependent crime: for example CSAM would fall into 
the first category, whereas live streaming of sexual 
abuse would be in the latter as it is only possible 
because of the technology.4 It would be true to 
say that online-facilitated child sexual abuse and 
exploitation has been seen as both a public health 
and criminal justice problem.5 There is a perception 
that with each new technological advancement, law 
enforcement, researchers, and advocates

8 Crimes Against Children Research Center, accessed 18 December 2018, http://www.unh.edu/ccrc/. find themselves out-paced as they combat ever-
changing and ever-growing problems. Due to the 
multi-faceted nature of online-facilitated child 
sexual abuse and exploitation, there are significant 
gaps in the way these crimes are understood. In 
her December 2014 report to the Human Rights 
Council, the Special Rapporteur on the sale and 
sexual exploitation of children called on States 
to “conduct research […] in order to obtain a 
comprehensive picture of the phenomena […]” and 
to “establish a reliable and standard information on 
the phenomena”.6 The same month, taking place in 
London, the #WePROTECT Children Online Global 
Summit that was convened by the government 
of the United Kingdom clearly highlighted the 
need for development of indicators and further 
collection of data.7 Global indicators and standards 
in data collection would provide clear language 
and metrics for law enforcement, researchers, and 
advocates to communicate more effectively about 
the phenomena. Currently, there is a growing 
body of data which show evidence of emerging 
trends in several key areas of online-facilitated 
child sexual abuse and exploitation. However, the 
preponderance of empirical studies has taken place 
within high income countries and, outside of the 
research from the Crimes Against Children Research 
Center,8 there is a paucity of longitudinal data to 
help us understand changing patterns of offending 
and victimisation in this area. To date, bids to 
quantify the scale of online-facilitated child sexual 
abuse and exploitation have counted the number  
 
 1. INTRODUCTIONTRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL7of: identified offenders or suspects, as well as 
young people who have engaged in harmful sexual 
behaviour; identified victims; reported offences 
(including public reports as well as crime statistics), 
and the number of confirmed CSAM (images and 
videos). By far the greatest number of publications 
identified in Wagner et al.’s rapid evidence review 
related to self-report victimisation studies.9 
THE AMOUNT OF CHILD  
SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL
The focus of this report is CSAM and questions 
about how much of it exists and whether there are 
changing patterns in the amount of new material 
being identified globally. In absolute terms, we can 
never quantify the amount of material that has 
been created or is in circulation on the Internet, 
because new content is constantly being added and 
only a proportion of older content (some of which 
predates the Internet but has been scanned and 
uploaded) will have been identified and taken down. 
Even with the use of custom-made web crawlers 
to aid notice and takedown of CSAM,10 there is 
no guarantee that it will not be uploaded again. 
However, common metrics to assess CSAM include 
reports from hotlines e.g. the absolute number of 
reported cases analysts have determined to contain 
illegal content over a period of time, and criminal 
justice records (e.g. how many individuals have been 
arrested for possessing CSAM): both methods have 
their limitations. Anecdotally, it is understood that 
material is traded across multiple platforms, and 
that the volume of material outstrips the resources 
available to law enforcement and hotline analysts to 
fully investigate or analyse. So, understandably, the 
number of arrests and reports can never accurately 
represent the actual amount of CSAM in circulation 
at any given time. 
Additionally, parsing out what method or 
terminology to use when measuring the amount 
of identified CSAM is difficult. Material could be 
examined by the number of children victimised in 
a series of images or case, the absolute number of 
images in a collection, or the number of offenders 
responsible for a series of images (either

pubmed/21349830. perpetrating the behaviour, producing the content, 
or distributing the material). An added complication 
is the number of unidentified offenders and victims. 
There are many offenders and images that will 
remain undetected by law enforcement or hotline 
analysts. These offenders are not missed only 
because law enforcement may have limited capacity 
to investigate them, but rather because they may 
use techniques to encrypt or anonymise their 
activities,11 or as with the case of new commercial 
websites, payment is only accepted by digital 
payment systems such as Bitcoin 12 as an emergent 
trend to avoid detection by offenders. 
Other limitations to gauging the amount of CSAM 
from these common metrics are the biases in the 
protocols and laws governing different jurisdictions. 
For example, some countries limit how proactive law 
enforcement agents can be in their investigations, 
requiring them to wait until material is reported 
to their departments before they can begin an 
investigation. Other countries have introduced 
legislation that allows law enforcement and hotline 
analysts to review areas of the Internet that are 
considered popular trading platforms (i.e., forums 
on the dark net). Some evidence has documented 
that the amount of arrests or reports stemming 
from the latter method of investigation has made 
a significant difference in the number of offenders 
detected.13 
PUBLIC REPORTS
Using the number of reports made by the public 
within a given time period to hotlines (a hotline is 
a national online resource that offers members of 
the public to report what they perceive as illegal 
online content) as a metric for the amount of CSAM 
in circulation, would suggest an incremental growth 
in these crimes over the total period that data has 
been collected. However, Donosa (2016) argues for 
caution when interpreting the number of public 
reports as evidence of an increase in the amount 
of CSAM. An increase in reporting may be due to 
other factors, such as an improvement in rates of 
detection because of technological tools, or because 
there has been an increase in human resources  
 
 TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL8available to manage it. It may also be the case that 
in some countries there is growing awareness of 
the problem and a willingness to report suspected 
CSAM. She concludes that because of the nature of 
the content being dealt with, and the impossibility 
of most hotlines to collect data directly from the 
source, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions: “As 
long as we are unclear how much child sexual 
abuse material is being produced, distributed and 
consumed out there, we will not be able to know for 
sure whether the problem has worsened or not”.14 
There are therefore caveats on how we should 
interpret public reporting of content, not the least 
because in 2015, in addition to receiving reports of 
online CSAM, 85% of hotlines in 2015 also accepted 
other types of reports, which included for example 
racism/hate speech (69%), adult pornography 
(64%), bullying (62%) and self-harm/suicide 
(44%). However, in this global study of hotlines, 
approximately one-third of those surveyed indicated 
that CSAM reports made up the majority of their 
workload.15 The National Center for Missing and 
Exploited Children (NCMEC), serves as the United 
States of America’s clearing house for CSAM through 
the CyberTipline. This provides an online mechanism 
for members of the public and electronic service 
providers (ESPs) to report incidents of suspected 
child sexual exploitation. This includes CSAM, 
sexual exploitation of children in travel and tourism, 
online enticement, trafficking of children for sexual 
purposes, child sexual molestation, misleading 
domain names or words, and unsolicited obscene 
material sent to a child. In the report to the United 
States House of Representatives Subcommittee in 
March 2017 it was noted that over recent years, the 
volume of CyberTipline reports received by NCMEC 
had increased from over 1.1 million reports in 2014, 
to more than 4.4 million reports in 2015, to more 
than 8.2 million reports in 2016. By the time of the 
report in 2017, NCMEC had already received over 
2.3 million CyberTipline reports.16 It was suggested

adoption by electronic service providers (ESPs) of 
new technology (such as PhotoDNA17) to enable 
the removal of child exploitation content from their 
platforms. In 2016 it was estimated that 94% of the 
reports submitted to CyberTipline by US-based ESPs 
involved someone outside of the United States. 
In the 2016 Annual Report from the Internet Watch 
Foundation (IWF),18 whose remit is to remove 
CSAM hosted anywhere in the world, including 
non-photographic CSAM hosted in the United 
Kingdom, of the 105,420 reports processed in 2016, 
57,162 were received from public sources with 
the remainder identified through analysts actively 
searching the open Internet using a combination 
of analyst searching and bespoke web crawlers. 
Of these, 57,335 URLs contained CSAM, twenty-
eight per cent of these reports were confirmed 
as containing CSAM.19 INHOPE (a global network 
of hotlines from 49 members whose remit is 
to deal with illegal content online and remove 
CSAM from the Internet),20 reported that they 
received 9,357,240 reports in 2016, with 8,474,713 
confirmed as containing CSAM.21 Cybertip.ca, the 
hotline hosted by the Canadian Centre for Child 
Protection processed 40,251 reports in 2016-17, 
49% of which were forwarded to law enforcement, 
child welfare and (or) INHOPE, or a notice was 
sent to an ESP to report CSAM hosted by a service 
provider in Canada or the United States.22 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE RECORDS
The extent of Internet-mediated sexual abuse 
and exploitation has also been examined through 
police data. The most substantial data set comes 
from the US longitudinal National Juvenile Online 
Victimisation (NJOV) study.23 This arrest study 
collected data in 2000, 2006 and 2009. These 
studies included two phases of data collection:  
 
 TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL9a postal survey of state, county and local law 
enforcement agencies in the US, of arrests made for  
technology-facilitated sexual crimes against children 
over a specified period of time, and telephone 
interviews concerning cases identified in the 
survey. There was a substantial increase in the 
number of arrests (from 2,577 in 2000 to 7,010 in 
2006 and 8,144 in 2009), although this may not 
indicate an actual increase (as there was an overlap 
in the estimated ranges at the 95% confidence 
interval). Approximately half of the arrests were for 
possession of CSAM (defined as ‘child pornography’ 
in the study). Arrests for crimes where the victim 
was known to the police (through CSAM production) 
increased by approximately 30% between 2000 
and 20006, and doubled between 2006 and 2009. 
This reflected a large increase in offenders who 
were known to their victims and described in the 
study as family and acquaintance offenders. Arrests 
that were made through proactive policing (police 
posing as children online) went down in 2009, 
although arrests for proactive investigation of CSAM 
offences increased in 2009 (2,353 compared to 880 
in 2006).24 The majority of people arrested in each 
wave of the study were male white Caucasians, 
although by 2009 a higher proportion arrests (16%) 
were members of minority ethnic groups. 
The increase in arrests for the production of child 
sexual abuse materials appeared to be largely 
driven by ‘youth-produced sexual images’ which 
were taken by children 17 years or under and 
which met the legal definitions in the US for ‘child 
pornography’. In most of these cases the person 
arrested was an adult who had solicited images 
from a minor. This was also reflected in the fact that 
there were more adolescent victims in 2009 and 
ones where they were face-to-face acquaintances 
with the person arrested. Adult-produced images 
were more likely than the images produced by 
adolescents to be taken by a family member (51% 
as opposed to 6%) who was aged 26 or older, with 
victims younger than 12 years. Adult producers were 
likely to possess additional CSAM which had been 
downloaded from the Internet, and to be discovered 
through law enforcement activity. One quarter 
of the adults producing images distributed them

had produced the images, 83% were distributed, 
mainly by adolescents who had taken pictures of 
themselves and sent them to others (over half by 
mobile phones).  
 
In 2009 the majority of the victims of CSAM 
production were aged 13–17, and overall more than 
half of the producers arrested had committed a 
contact sexual offence, documented in the images 
taken.25 
 
This data is now quite old, and there is a paucity of 
comparable offence data outside the US, as many 
countries do not have the resources to research 
this area or do not disaggregate their sexual offence 
data. 
In the UK, it was reported that the number of 
offenders convicted of taking, making or distributing 
child abuse images increased by 35%, from 921 in 
2005/06 to 1,247 in 2012/13, with 2,515 offences 
reported in 2012/13 for possession.26 The Rapid

possessing or distributing CSAM) has doubled 
across the UK between 2010/2011 and 2014/15 
and that these increases have been attributed to an 
increase in the creation or distribution of indecent 
or pseudo-photographs of adults and children using 
Internet and mobile technology.28 However, others 
have argued that these increases may be due to 
more targeted and coordinated activity by the UK 
National Crime Agency and other law enforcement 
agencies.29 Earlier threat assessment reports by 
NCA-CEOP Command (2010-2012) noted changing 
patterns in the types of victimisation within seized 
images (increases in the egregiousness of the sexual 
assaults) and the ages of the children becoming 
younger and involving more females. However, 
these studies provide limited information as to the 
methodology involved in these estimates.30 
Police data from the Netherlands was used to 
examine the attributes of seized CSAM and the 
characteristics of arrested offenders. Their data was TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL10drawn from 159 police files involving 172 suspects 
investigated in 2007.31 The majority of their suspects 
(93.6%) had only one victim, and where  
there were cases of multiple suspects, these 
did not appear to be part of organised criminal 
networks. Over 98% of the suspects were male 
and ranged from 14-83 years of age, but 35% were 
under 18. Often, these were young people who 
had taken sexualised pictures and/or videos of 
themselves and/or each other. However, it has to 
be acknowledged that these were largely samples 
of convenience and are likely to represent only a 
proportion of those involved in CSAM. 
PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF 
ABUSIVE IMAGES
A US study of arrests for CSAM production at two 
time-points (2000/2001 and 2006) indicated an 
increase in adolescent victims, but no increase 
in the proportion involving very young victims.32 
Many of the cases involved self-produced sexual 
images by adolescents and involving adult sex 
offenders. A third sample indicated that arrests for 
CSAM production quadrupled between 2000-2009 
which was attributed to cases of self-produced 
sexual images solicited from minors by adult 
offenders.33 However, of note is that in 2009 most 
youth-produced images were distributed, usually 
by youth who took pictures of themselves and 
sent them to others. Images were uploaded to the 
Internet in approximately 1 in 10 cases. Although 
there has been an increase in the amount of CSAM 
produced by adolescents in the context of coercive 
relationships, the NJOV-3 survey indicated that most 
CSAM was still produced by adult offenders. Adults 
either created images of minors themselves (37%) 
or enticed minors to produce images (39%). Adult-
produced images were more likely to be perpetrated 
by a family member, have victims younger than 
12-years of age, be perpetrated by offenders aged 
26 or older and who also possessed CSAM images

Of importance in relation to deterrence was that 
the authors concluded that increases in arrests were 
related to high levels of law-enforcement activity by 
agencies trained to respond to technology-facilitated 
crimes. 
The introduction of technological landmarks such 
as the Internet, digital cameras, and smart phones 
over the past two decades has radically altered the 
way offenders sexually exploit children.34 Currently, 
researchers have looked at the difference between 
offenders using ‘active, real-time’ platforms (i.e. 
live streaming and webcams) to transmit material 
versus those who use passive platforms (i.e. 
Torrents) to distribute CSAM. The complexities 
around determining the amount of CSAM that 
exists can be explored through image production 
through commercial exploitation. An example of 
live streaming of child sexual abuse for payment is 
provided by Terre des Hommes Netherlands who 
conducted research in nineteen English-language 
public chat rooms where four researchers posed 
as pre-pubescent Filipino girls. The researchers 
then waited for people to make contact and 
request a webcam sex performance. Contacts were 
reminded that they were interacting with a pre-
pubescent child. If they continued to request a sex 
show, researchers began working to identify them. 
During the 10-weeks observation 20,172 offenders 
attempted to engage in live streaming of sexual 
abuse.35 A systematic study of US Internet-facilitated 
sexual exploitation was examined through data 
from 569 arrests in 2006. 36 Offenders either used 
the Internet to purchase or sell access to identified 
children for sexual purposes, including CSAM 
production (36%), or used the Internet to purchase 
or sell images they possessed but did not produce. 
A qualitative study of Swedish youth commercially 
exploited online indicated that this included the 
purchase of CSAM, ranging from semi-nude pictures 
to live-streaming.37
 
 TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL11CHARACTERISTICS OF OFFENDERS
It has been consistently noted across studies 
that CSAM offenders represent a heterogeneous 
group, who display wide variation in their sexual 
preoccupation with CSAM and their motivation to 
offend. 38 In relation to this, it has been observed39 
that a fundamental problem with prevention  
policy in the criminal justice system is that it is 
largely based on stereotypical, and often mistaken, 
characterisation of sex offender populations — for 
example the common view of them as exclusively 
adult males who have a sexual orientation towards 
pre-pubescent children (paedophiles) and who are 
strongly motivated to offend. While the majority 
of offender-related research has used samples of 
people convicted of technology-mediated abuse and 
exploitation, there have been a few studies drawn 
from general population samples as well as people 
who were seeking help. For example, an online 
survey of 8,718 German men, found that 4.1% 
reported sexual fantasies involving prepubescent 
children, 3.2% reported sexual offending against 
prepubescent children, and 0.1% reported a 
pedophilic sexual preference.  Men who reported 
exclusive use of CSAM were identified as a subgroup 
who differed from contact sexual offenders against 
prepubescent children and men who reported 
both CSAM use and contact sexual offenses against 
prepubescent children.40 A further US study 
recruited 262 females and 173 males through an 
online survey to examine sexual interest and adverse 
childhood experiences. Six per cent of men indicated 
some likelihood of having sex with a child if they 
could get away with it (as did 2% of women)

likelihood of viewing CSAM on the Internet.41 In  
offender samples, differences have been found  
between CSAM offenders and contact offenders 
in relation to higher levels of Internet use,42 lower 
levels of anti-social behaviour,43 differences in 
empathy44 and evidence of compulsive or addictive 
behaviour.45 However, much of the offender-related  
research has focused on risk of a CSAM offender 
either having a prior history of contact offending or 
whether they will go on to commit a further contact 
offence.46 Two significant studies in relation to risk 
come from Canada, with the development of the 
Child Pornography Offender Risk Tool (CPORT),47 and 
the UK (KIRAT: Kent Internet Risk Assessment Tool).48 
THE SEXUAL CONTENT OF ABUSIVE 
IMAGES
One area that has been standardised is the 
terminology used to grade the sexual activity 
depicted in CSAM. An example of this would be the 
COPINE scale developed by Quayle and colleagues 
that sorts sexual activity into ten categories.49 This 
scale was later adapted to a 5-point scale to grade 
images by the Sentencing Advisory Panel.50 However, 
the scale has not been incorporated into many law 
enforcement and hotline databases and, instead, is 
used more for prosecution and academic purposes. 
Researchers have coded samples of images and 
reported trends within specific databases over a 
given timeframe, but there has yet to be a global 
effort to code and report trends in sexual activity.  
 
 TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL12While anecdotally, law enforcement and hotline 
analysts have expressed concern over sexual content 
of the material becoming more aggressive51 and 
the proportion of violent material increasing,52 
there is little consistent empirical evidence. Though 
reporting the sexual activity in CSAM may appear 
straightforward, a given cases could involve multiple 
victims, as well as multiple offenders, there are 
tensions around what exactly is recorded. Some 
victims may experience different levels of abuse  
or violence. Likewise, not every image or video 
may contain the same level of sexual activity. 
Additionally, when reporting trends, it is not always 
clear whether only new material during a timeframe 
will be used to generate estimates on the amount of 
violence, or all the material seen circulating during 
the timeframe. For instance, if there is a greater 
market for violent imagery, law enforcement may 
find that offenders are recirculating older material 
that is extremely violent, which would be missed if 
only new material was used to examine trends.
CHARACTERISTICS OF VICTIMS
While there is extensive research on offenders, 
very little is known about the children depicted in 
sexually abusive material, especially in the global 
landscape. To date, much of the research has 
involved identified victims within law enforcement 
databases, which may not be representative of the 
general population of children who are sexually 
exploited online, particularly as a limited number 
of countries are compiling databases of CSAM and 
where they do exist these tend to be from the global 
north. We also have very little evidence to help us 
differentiate between identified and non-identified 
children who have been abused in the production 
or exchange of CSAM. Studies of the databases that 
do exist, suggest there are more female victims 
than males, significantly more white than non-
white victims, and that most children featured in 
material are prepubescent.53 CSAM can, however, 
be produced across different contexts which, as 
previously discussed, may reflect changes in our 
relatively recent ability to create digital content. A 
study of 3,503 Swedish 18-year-old youth, indicated

59 IWF (2014), “IWF Operational trends 2014: Overview”.that 6.5% of those who reported sexual abuse had 
also experienced the abuse being documented in  
pictures or videos.54 In an early study by the same 
researcher, children identified in seized CSAM 
were interviewed and their images analysed. All 
of these were taken during acts of sexual abuse 
by the perpetrators who, in some cases, had also 
distributed the CSAM. No images were produced by 
the children.55 A further study from Turkey 56 (2015) 
examined the medical records of 662 sexual abuse 
victims referred through the courts to a Child and 
Adolescent clinic. Ninety-three reported at  
least one of the following: online/offline sexual acts 
through e-mail, cell phones, text messages, and 
Internet sites; an image of the victim of a sexual 
nature or of the sexual abuse itself recorded on a 
mobile phone/camera, with threats of distribution 
if s/he did not continue sexual acts; the image 
shared online/offline; and the victim subjected 
to online harassment or offline sexual abuse by 
other offenders that knew about the image.57 For 
these children, digital technology was significantly 
associated with more severe forms of abuse, such as 
penetrative sex, recurrent sexual abuse and multiple 
offenders.
This victim-focused research reflects evidence also 
seen in offender studies of the production and use 
of CSAM images as part of the offence process.58 
By the end of 2015, the International Child Sexual 
Exploitation Database (ICSE DB) included data on 
more than 8,000 identified victims from nearly 50 
countries, but still little was known about these 
children. ChildBase is a database developed by the 
Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre 
(CEOP) and consisted of CSAM images gathered 
from police seizures across the United Kingdom. In 
a randomised sample of 24,550 unique sexualised 
images of children from the database (approximately 
10%), it was found that the images contained 
four times more girls than boys and almost 10 
times more white than non-white children. The 
UK Internet Watch Foundation reported that after 
analysing all child sexual abuse URLs in 2014, 80% 
of all the children were 10 years or younger.59 The 
Interpol Child Sexual Exploitation Image Database 
(ICSE DB) contains important information about  
 TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL13child abuse image crimes. A recent study quantified  
the characteristics of 687 children in identified  
illegal images, from the UK claimed cases from the 
database, and described the differences between 
cases of self-taken images and those whose images 
had been taken by others.60 The analysis showed 
an increase in identified victims during the study 
years 2006-2015. Almost two thirds of the children 
identified were female, the majority were white and 
44.3% were self-taken (34.4% taken in a coercive 
and 9.9% in a non-coercive relationship). The data 
also indicated that since 2010, the number of self-
taken images each year exceeded more than 40%  
of the total number of images in the database. 
Although self-taken images could potentially be 
perceived as less worrisome, two-thirds of all the 
images within this study were classified as coercive. 
However, the yearly reports of organisations such 
as the Internet Watch Foundation would suggest 
that there are fluctuations in the characteristics 
of the children depicted in CSAM. In 2015 the IWF 
reported that material involving prepubescent 
children made up a smaller fraction of all reports 
(69%) than was seen in 2012 (81%), with pubescent 
victims increasing; however, the amount of material 
involving children two years old or younger 
remained constant over the same four-year span 
(about 3-4%).61 By 2016 the IWF had seen a further 
overall drop in the children assessed as being 10 
or younger and an increase in reports of children 
11-15. This proportionate drop was felt in part to 
be related to the increase in self-produced content 
which had been shared online, alongside of the fact 
that the IWF also actively searches for images (which 
exceeded public reports in 2016) and therefore were 
more likely to encounter more images of 11-15-year 
olds. In their report there were also fewer images 
falling into categories A (penetrative sexual activity) 
or B (non-penetrative activity) in either 2014 or 
2015. Differences were also seen between data from 
the Canadian Centre for Child Protection in 2008 
which showed that 49.64% of child victims were 
under the age of eight years old62 when compared 
with the ChildBase study which showed relatively 
low numbers of very young victims (only 0.7% of 
females and 1.6% of males were infant/toddlers).63

UNIDENTIFIED-VICTIMS-IN-CHILD-SEXUAL-EXPLOITATION-MATERIAL.pdf. A further study examined two different datasets 
from the NCMEC database of identified children.64 
This included actively traded cases (518 cases 
involving 933 victims which were seen in 5 or more 
reports to NCMEC) from 2002-2013 and identified 
child victims (1,965 cases including one offender 
and one victim and 633 cases involving multiple 
offenders/victims from July 2011-June 2014) 
whether traded or not. The most notable finding 
from the first dataset was a trend towards more 
egregious sexual content over time (more abusive 
sexual content in later years), but with no obvious 
trends in relation to child victim age or gender. In 
the second dat set involving a single offender and 
victim, cases that were actively traded involved 
pre-pubescent victims, more egregious sexual 
content, and more likely to involve familial offenders 
(particularly nuclear family members). 
However, in the second dataset of 1.965 cases 61% 
of cases involving single victims and 42% where 
there were multiple relationships the children were 
pubescent. Most cases involved male offenders who 
were unrelated to the child, but cases that involved 
female offenders, younger children or more extreme 
content were likely to involve family members. In a 
further analysis of the ICSE database of unidentified 
victims conducted by ECPAT International and 
Interpol,65 64.8% were girls, 31.1% were boys and 
the remaining 4.1% included children of both 
genders. Where boys were depicted the content 
was more egregious. Within this dataset 93.9% of 
the children were white, and where age could be 
determined, the largest group were pre-pubescent 
(56.2%). Similar to the NCMEC analysis there was 
also a relationship between the age of the victim 
and the severity of the abuse. Across the three 
studies ( NCMEC, ICSE UK and ECPAT/Interpol) very 
young children were in the minority (6% and 3% of 
the second data set from NCMEC; 4.3% in the total 
ICSE DB unidentified children and approximately 6% 
of the ICSE UK claimed cases of identified children). 
In the first dataset from NCMEC of only actively 
traded cases between 2002-2013, the number of 
infants victimised varied between years (6.5-12.4%), 
but the lowest value related to 2013. 
 
 
 TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL14OBJECTIVE
The objective of this report was to speak with 
experts in this field to uncover why trends in 
the data may be occurring. We were particularly 
interested in experts’ opinions on trends in the 
age of victims of online child sexual exploitation 
(OCSE) and the severity of the sexual activity being 
depicted in CSAM. Furthermore, we intended to 
explore national databases in order to contribute 
to establishing standards and global metrics of 
CSAM to promote evidence-based advocacy 
and programming. We wished to document 
the interaction between key variables (amount 
of material, the production and distribution of 
material, offender characteristics, the sexual content 
of material, and victim characteristics). 
MAPPING EXISTING DATABASES  
Collections of data that relate to CSAM fall largely 
into two groups: hash collections and image 
collections. The hashing process is a mathematical 
algorithm that produces a hexadecimal numeric 
value relating to binary data. A hash value is a 
small, convenient number used to track or sort an 
arbitrary block of data. Each image file hash value 
is represented by a unique string of 32 characters, 
effectively without visible order, sequence, or 
connection to the actual file name or content of 
the image.66 According to Microsoft, data can be 
compared to a hash value to determine its integrity. 
Usually, data is hashed at a certain time and the 
hash value is protected in some way. At a later time, 
the data can be hashed again and compared to the 
protected value. If the hash values match, the data 
has not been altered. If the values do not match, 
the data has been corrupted. For this system to 
work, the protected hash must be encrypted or kept 
secret from all untrusted parties.67 However, it is also 
important to distinguish between image databases 
and image libraries. The former is fully searchable 
and contains associated metadata related to cases 
within data, (such as hash sets) that can be exported 
and shared with others. An image library is more 
akin to a flat file/folder structure where material 
may be grouped together on a case by case basis, 
but cross-comparison of the data is not really 
possible, and there are significant limits to what can 
be exported from it.68 There are

some smaller police agencies around the world, or 
those who are just starting a victim identification 
unit. Other organisations maintain their own hash 
sets, which may facilitate workload management 
in terms of recognising material that has already 
been seen so that it can either be discounted from 
the victim identification process or that it can be 
precategorised for the court process because it has 
already been categorised previously (for example 
through determining the age of the child or the 
nature of the image content).69 At present there is 
limited connectivity between databases. 
At an international level, as referred previously, 
INTERPOL houses and maintains the ICSE Database, 
and also the ICCAM database on behalf of INHOPE. 
EUROPOL hosts and maintains IVAS (Investigation 
Video and Audio System), which is a database 
of material generally seized by law enforcement 
agencies in EU member states or countries with 
third party agreements with EUROPOL (e.g. 
Australia, Canada or the USA) or seized as a result 
of joint investigations in these countries. Project 
Vic70 maintains a hash (and associated meta-data) 
database for material seized and held in the US 
and administers rules of engagement for the 
various Project Vic members around the world 
(Law Enforcement Agencies, Non-Government 
Organisations, Industry etc.). While there is no 
international hash database provided by Project Vic, 
international collaboration may take place under 
the auspices of Project Vic, but this currently take 
place on a bilateral basis.71 The National Center for 
Missing and Exploited Children acts as the clearing 
house for seized material from federal and local  law 
enforcement agencies in the USA and in  
doing so contributes to both NGO and Industry 
hash-sharing platforms which extend beyond the 
USA into International organisations.
At a national level, of the countries currently 
connected to ICSE, the following maintain databases 
of seized material: Australia (the Australian Police 
and the Queensland Police Service both have  
 
 
 TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL15separate databases, and there is a project in place 
to provide a national solution giving direct access 
to all states and territories); Belgium; Canada (the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police maintain a national 
database which has limited functionality from the 
various provincial and regional agencies in Canada. 
The Ontario Provincial Police and Toronto also 
maintain their own collections to assist with their 
victim identification function); Denmark; France; 
Germany; Netherlands; New Zealand; Sweden; 
United Kingdom (UK Child Abuse Images Database: 
CAID); United States (Homeland  
72 Ibid.
73 Howard, D. (2018, personal communication). Network Services & Training Manager, INHOPE.Security Investigations and the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation also have their own collections, as do 
other agencies such as the US Postal Service and 
the Department of Justice). It is likely that there are 
other image libraries in Austria, Finland, Ireland, 
Israel, Italy, Japan, Moldova, Norway, Spain and 
Switzerland used as an aid to victim identification.72
 
An example of a hash database is provided by 
INHOPE, an international network of hotlines, as 
described below.73
BOX 1: INHOPE and the ICCAM system  
INHOPE is the global umbrella organisation uniting national Internet hotlines engaged in combating online 
child sexual exploitation and child sexual abuse material. The mission of INHOPE is to support and enhance 
the work of these hotlines to strengthen international efforts to combat child sexual abuse using a multi 
stakeholder approach. The network consists of 51 hotlines in 45 countries worldwide. When members 
of the public come across child sexual abuse material on the Internet, they can anonymously report the 
suspected illegal content to the hotline in their country. The aim of the INHOPE Hotline Network is to 
streamline processes for reporting illegal online content when it involves the sexual abuse or exploitation 
of a child. Hotlines often encourage reporting even for suspected exploitation, such as ‘child modelling’ 
(INHOPE, 2016). 
In 2015 INHOPE with the support and funding from the European Commission developed and launched the 
ICCAM (I-‘’See’’ (c)-Child-Abuse-Material) system initially as a pilot project and ultimately was rolled out to 
the full INHOPE network. The Hotlines receive reports from the public on potentially illegal content. These 
reports that contain a URL pointing at the content, are entered in the ICCAM system. 
Crawling and assessment:  ICCAM crawls the URL and downloads images and video to a centralised 
infrastructure based in INTERPOL. The system then allows the Hotline analyst via a browser to remotely 
classify the content under predetermined criteria (e.g. baseline and national). Once the content has been 
confirmed as child sexual abuse material the relevant elements of the report are forwarded to the INHOPE 
Hotline in that country. 
Hashing technology: As part of this, hashing technology is deployed to ’finger-print’ reported images and 
video, which allows for more rapid action in the work flow and automatic flagging of ‘new’ confirmed 
CSAM content that has not been reported to or seen by law enforcement previously. ‘New’ confirmed 
CSAM content is automatically flagged to law enforcement victim identification team in INTERPOL. This 
also minimises duplication of effort as analyst can see what has already been assessed as illegal (baseline 
or national) even if the content reported was a totally separate report to another Hotline at any point 
in the past. All of these elements speed up report handling plus reduce the amount of traumatic CSAM 
material that Hotline analysts must view. A simple reflection of these factors is the ‘’Notice & Takedown 
statistic’’ which has improved dramatically to where 75% of confirmed CSAM reports were removed from 
the Internet within 72 hours (INHOPE 2016 Annual Report).
Data:  ICCAM has the ability to gather almost real-time global data on the trends and statistics on the 
dissemination of online CSAM and the consequential actions by hotlines (e.g. notice and takedown times). 
This allows for period-by-period comparison and analysis. TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL16An example of an image database is provided below.
BOX 2: Interpol ICSE Database 
The Interpol Child Sexual Exploitation Image database (ICSE database). It was launched in March 2009 as the 
successor to the Interpol Child Abuse Image Database (ICAID), which had been in use since 2001. To meet 
the challenges of technological change the ICSE-DB has been updated on several occasions and version four 
of the database is currently under development, through financial support from the European Commission, 
to enhance connectivity with national child abuse material databases. ICSE-DB is the only global platform of 
its kind which enables specialist law-enforcement officers to use image and video comparison software to 
identify victims, abusers and locations through an analysis of images, videos and hashes. 
The ICSE Database is available through INTERPOL’s secure global police communications system, I-24/7, and 
certified users in member countries can access the database directly and in real time, providing immediate 
responses to queries related to child sexual exploitation investigations. This both facilitates the identification 
of children but also manages potential duplication of efforts that would occur if multiple law enforcement 
agencies were attempting to identify the same victim or victims. Countries seeking access to the database 
need to demonstrate the existence of national legislation in relation to child sexual abuse material (CSAM), 
a specialist national victim identification unit, and sufficient connectivity to support the use of the database. 
This database is managed by Interpol and provides a powerful intelligence and investigative tool that 
allows specialised investigators to share information with colleagues on a global basis. The information 
in the database relates to children, identified through image analysis and specialist and routine policing, 
whose images meet the criteria for indecency across most jurisdictions (see Gillespie, 2010) as well as 
indicative material that may not meet these criteria but may be a valuable source of intelligence. In 2015, 
the ICSE DB included data on 8,000 identified victims from more than 50 countries, as well as data related 
to numerous unidentified victims, whose cases are yet to be investigated (http://www.interpol.int/Crime-
areas/Crimes-against-children/Victim- identification). By January 2017 Interpol reported that the network 
of 53 countries had identified 10,000 sexual abuse victims in the last seven years (https://www.interpol.int/
News-and-media/News/2017/N2017-001). Images or videos that are uploaded to the ICSE-DB are verified 
as to whether they are already known to the system, or whether the child or children within the media, or 
the suspect or offender, is already known to the system. These constitute known cases. 
As can be seen from the previous section on 
public reports, a number of the hotlines provide 
yearly information on public reports and proactive 
searching. A brief overview of this data from the 
IWF, CyberTipline and Cybertip.ca is presented here.
IWF: In 2016 59,550 reports were received which 
were assessed as criminal content from a total of 
105,420 reports, representing a 12.5% decrease 
from 2015. Age profiles of children suggested an 
increase in self-produced content, with public 
reports more likely to be of children 10 years old 
and under. The IWF classification of the images 
indicated that nearly half of children under 15 
years of age were in either Category A or B (the 
two most egregious categories), although this 
represented a decline from previous years. Their 
report indicated an increase in the number of 
domains hosting CSAM, and of these 80% of all 
webpages that contained CSAM were concentrated 
across five domains: .com; .net; .se; .io, and .cc. Social networks were the least likely to contain 
CSAM and image hosting sites the most consistent 
for hosting CSAM. 2016 saw Europe hosting 
more identified pages containing CSAM than any 
other region , representing a 19% increase for 
2015. The top five countries hosting CSAM URLs 
were: the Netherlands; the US; Canada; France 
and Russia. There was a decline in the number 
of newly identified hidden services and a large 
decrease in the number of web pages deemed to be 
commercial. 
CyberTipline: This is a US-based service and is 
hosted by NCMEC. Their data showed an increase 
of 90% between 2014 to 2015 in reports alleged 
child sexual exploitation or sexual extortion, with 
1,428 sexual extortion reports being made between 
October 2013 to April 2016. The majority of these 
reports came from Internet companies, but 24% 
came from child victims. TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL17Cybertip.ca: This is operated by the Canadian Centre 
for Child Protection. Between 2002-2009 the hotline 
responded to over 215,000 CSE reports from the 
public (with 514 arrests).74 Data from their Survivor’s 
Survey of 150 adults indicated that all had been 
subjected to child sexual abuse and video-recorded. 
61% of those responding to the online survey felt 
that it was likely their images had been distributed. 
The primary perpetrators were family members or 
part of the extended family (82%), 87% said they 
were under 11 years when the abuse started and for 
42% the abuse lasted over ten years. Over the last 
15 years, over 266,000 reports had been received 
by cybertip.ca, with over 19,000 forwarded to a 
Canadian law enforcement agency. 
74 Bunzeluk K. (2009), “Child Sexual Abuse Images: An Analysis of Websites by cybertip.ca”, Winnipeg: Canadian Centre for Child 
Protection, accessed 20 January 2018,  https://docplayer.net/19341017-Child-sexual-abuse-images-an-analysis-of-websites-by-
november-2009.html. INHOPE Foundation: In 2014, 89,758 URLs were 
reported to this global network of hotlines, which 
was a 63% increase from 2013. In 2014 most CSAM 
was identified on image hosting sites, websites, file 
hosting sites, social networking sites and banner 
sites. Ninety-one per cent of images were hosted for 
non-commercial purposes. The INHOPE 2016 report 
indicated that the network received 9,357,240 
reports with 8,474,713 confirmed as CSAM and 
suggested that the majority of CSAM encountered 
by hotlines depicted predominantly pre-pubescent 
females. TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL182. STUDY DESIGN AND RATIONALE
There have long been calls for global metrics for 
CSAM but these are very difficult to establish given 
the complexity of these crimes. Specifically, global 
metrics would aid in evidence-based advocacy and 
programming. Research continues to be limited by 
lack of standards, size of sample, or generalizability 
of findings. For a range of reasons, most research 
and analysis of CSAM has previously focused on 
single databases or even subsets of images from 
within a database. However, as technology rapidly 
advances, CSAM is more and more becoming a 
globalised concern and the need for bigger picture 
analysis is strong. This study therefore aimed to 
frame the analysis of CSAM trends in a much more 
global perspective. 
The design therefore was to broaden our net as 
much as possible for a global perspective. We aimed 
to gather detailed perspectives from a sample of 
CSAM experts from all over the world. We sought 
to establish and understand trends in victim, 
offender and content characteristics over time. 
We sought also to examine the trends identified 
in our qualitative data with preliminary analysis of 
complementary quantitative data from multiple 
sources wherever we could.
QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS
Semi-structured expert interviews with the primary 
objective of investigating perceived trends in the age 
of victims and the severity of the sexual activity in 
CSAM formed the basis of this study. 
An interview guide was developed that covered a 
breadth of topics thought to impact OCSE (Appendix 
A). The interview guide covered victim profiles, 
common characteristics of CSAM, offender profiles, 
changes in the sexual content of CSAM, changes in 
production and distribution methods, and questions 
about how policy and practice around online sexual 
exploitation could be improved. We chose these 
topic areas given their relevance to developing 
global metrics as well as their potential to identify 
both the age of victims and the sexual activity in the 
material. We wished to explore whether there were 
 
 
75 Bryant, Antony and Charmaz, Kathy (Eds.) (2007), “The SAGE Handbook of Grounded Theory”, Los Angeles: Sage, accessed 3 
February 2018, https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/the-sage-handbook-of-grounded-theory/book234413. changes in the ages of the children or the severity of 
sexual activity as evidenced in CSAM. 
We interviewed law enforcement agents and hotline 
analysts who had at least one year of current 
experience working with CSAM since they would 
be able to speak to current incidents and recent 
changes. This population was also selected because 
they would be familiar with material involving 
both undetected and detected offenders as well as 
unidentified and identified victims.
Respondents were recruited with invitations and 
flyers that were distributed to key stakeholders and 
organizations. Once participants were recruited and 
screened for eligibility, they were consented into the 
study. Studies were primarily conducted in English, 
with a small portion being conducted in Spanish. 
While it was a requirement that the participants 
fluently speak English or Spanish, it was often not 
the participants’ primary language. Two participants 
used professional translators to participate in the 
study. Interview extracts from all the participants 
have been edited with brackets for readability.
The research team was composed of a Research 
Leader and a Research Assistant. Both team 
members had Master’s degrees in public 
health or health sciences and several years of 
research experience. Both team members had 
conducted national and international research 
on the prevention of child sexual abuse and were 
knowledgeable in OCSE. They both were certified 
in ethical human subject research and had previous 
training in qualitative interviewing, transcription, 
and analyses. The Research Assistant had 
professional qualifications in Spanish language skills 
and had conducted previous interviews in Spanish. 
Interviews were analysed using the grounded-
theory method.75 The team members were trained 
to conduct semi-structured interviews following 
the interview guide (Appendix A). Interviewers 
walked the participant through a series of discussion 
topics related to the study goals and objectives but 
had flexibility to probe further on topics in which 
the participant was particularly knowledgeable. 
Interviews took approximately thirty minutes to one  
 
 TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL19hour. Following the interview, audio files were  
transcribed. In the case of Spanish interviews, 
transcripts were also translated. Two initial  
transcripts were coded line by line, and then  
line codes were compiled into a codebook. After 
the codebook was developed, three transcripts 
were double coded to check for consistency and 
understanding in applying codes. Codes were then 
applied to the remaining transcripts. These codes 
were analysed and organised to identify emergent 
themes.
A total of 18 qualitative interviews were conducted. 
Participants were from EUROPOL and INTERPOL, as 
well as hotlines and agencies in Australia, Colombia, 
Finland, France, Mexico, New Zealand, the United 
Kingdom, Slovenia, Spain, South Africa, and Taiwan. 
COMPLEMENTARY QUANTITATIVE DATA
Our search for such quantitative data encountered 
some expected barriers. Many agencies around 
the world simply lack the resources to generate 
and maintain complex databases, and where they 
do, data provides a particular picture based on 
local priorities. Where databases do exist, access 
is usually closely limited for obvious and justified 
reasons. Comparisons between these sources 
can also be complicated given it is collected along 
procedural rather than research priorities.
76  See e.g. NetClean (2016), “10 important insights into child sexual abuse crime: the NetClean report 2016”.Invitations and flyers were initially distributed to law 
enforcement and hotline agencies around the globe 
requesting data on CSAM. This recruitment method 
failed to yield significant data. The team then instead 
asked law enforcement and hotline analysts who 
participated in the qualitative portion of the study 
to provide quantitative data. Four agencies agreed 
to supply data for the project. These agencies 
varied greatly in the type of data they shared. See 
Appendix B for added detail of what was supplied by 
the four agencies. 
Cautions on the reliability of existing CSAM 
databases being used to draw conclusions 
about trends have been noted previously.76 The 
quantitative data that we were able to collect for 
this study therefore doesn’t allow for representative 
conclusions. However, it is presented throughout the 
results section in parallel to the trends identified by 
the experts in the qualitative data.TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL203. RESULTS
Qualitative interviews with 18 experts from around 
the globe were used to discuss trends in OCSE, 
specifically, interviews were focused on trends in the 
age of victims of OCSE and the severity of the sexual 
activity being depicted in CSAM. To fully understand 
how and why these changes were taking place, 
the qualitative interview guide sought to develop a 
framework around participants’ background and  
experience working with CSAM, characterise the 
‘typical’ victim depicted in material, discuss changes 
in the sexual content, production, and distribution 
methods of material, and review current policy and 
practice methods that could be improved or built 
upon. Below, each component is further explored.
 
UNDERSTANDING WHO  
PARTICIPATED
Participants were law enforcement agents 
and hotline analysts who had at least a year of 
experience working with child sexual abuse material; 
however, most of the participants had served their 
departments considerably longer, with the upper 
limit being approximately 20 years of service. 
Participants described their roles as incredibly 
demanding, with many taking on far more 
responsibilities than merely investigating or 
analysing material. They often worked with small 
teams of individuals and felt their departments 
were underfunded or in need of additional staff. 
The individuals spoke to the variety of activities 
they performed, including analysing material, 
investigating perpetrators, identifying victims, coding 
material, and educating the public. Below one 
investigator describes the educational aspect of his 
position:
“[in my department] we are also 
responsible for going out to provide 
public education where we are warning 
the public about the dangers of cyber 
space; clearly emphasising the issue 
of distribution of ‘child pornography’, 
creation of ‘child pornography’, and, 
also, production…” 
 
 
 
 
77  Netclean (2015), “Eleven Unbelievable Truths: The NetClean Report 2015”, 39, 40.Similar demands on law enforcement were noted in 
NetClean’s qualitative study, with one of their eleven 
truths being supported by the fact that “17% 
of [police] say identifying victims is not prioritized 
in their organization” and “63% say they have too 
much material to go through to have time to work 
on identifying victims”.77 Being responsible for so 
many different aspects of the investigation greatly 
affected what participants could accomplish. 
We asked our participants about their current 
caseload, and they ranged widely in how many 
cases they investigated the past year. Some 
participants reported their teams focused on a very 
small number of cases (30-50), while others had 
the resources to analyse hundreds of reports. We 
discussed whether the current caseload was similar 
or different than previous years, and most agreed 
they were receiving more material, but were not 
always able to investigate more cases. They felt that 
advances in technology and changes in reporting  
procedures had led to their agencies receiving more 
reports or uncovering more imagery than they had 
previously. As one hotline analyst described:
“I suppose the workload increases […] 
because we do a lot of work where we 
will work with our local police forces, 
who may come to us for advice and 
assistance. As we’ve become a more 
established team and people know 
who we are and the mechanisms are in 
place for people to make referrals, […] 
we see an increase in the work because 
more people want to come and ask for 
our help basically.”
While an increase in reports seems like a good 
thing given the apparent increase in material being 
circulated, participants felt they could not keep 
up with the demand. Consistently, lack of funding 
prevented law enforcement from investigating the 
additional reports: 
 
 
 
 
 
 TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL21“The amount of referrals that are 
coming in [are] increasing. From an 
output capability point of view, because 
our resources haven’t increased, we 
haven’t been able to increase the 
number of investigations that we’ve 
done, which are tied to the level of 
[resources] that we have. […] If we 
had more staff, we would have greater 
output. As I said, certainly  
the number of cases that have been 
through, to us, has increased over the 
last three or four years.”  
Some participants described hierarchies their 
agencies had in place for prioritising cases. 
Investigators discussed new material and younger 
children as the main reasons to prioritise a case. 
It is important to note that some participants did 
not prioritise any case over another since they felt 
any material featuring a subject who was under the 
age of eighteen necessitated an investigation. The 
following quote gives an example of the investigative 
hierarchies that one team leader used:
“We look at a variety of factors. We 
look at, for example, any new material, 
so if there’s content that we haven’t 
seen before, where there’s a potential 
for abuse taking place, we look at the 
severity of the material, we look at the 
number and unity of subject matter. If 
somebody’s presenting initially from 
intelligence as a clear, established boy 
lover, for example, into very young 
children, into babies, that kind of thing, 
those sorts of elements get prioritised. 
Acting in a distribution capacity, that 
would get priority over a position 
element. The lifelong extent and length 
of offending type of material, those 
would be the main [priority]. And 
ultimately if we identified that the 
username has been seen before, or the 
person has been seen as a previous 
offender, or had previous criminal 
behaviour, we would look to prioritise it 
as well.”Prioritising cases only makes sense if there are 
victims or offenders that pose greater risks to 
community safety. However, the interaction between 
these variables has not been well-documented or 
standardised. Clearly this department saw a benefit 
in prioritising cases based on a hierarchy, but that 
was not always the case. Understanding risk profiles 
or the interaction between variables (such as victim 
age, the newness of the material, or the distribution 
method used) and their potential to lead to an 
arrest or identified victim would help establish a 
best practice.
CHARACTERISING THE TYPICAL VICTIM
Every participant agreed that victims were 
predominantly white. Some participants reported 
they handled a small number of cases involving 
Asian and Hispanic children as well, but black 
children were by far the rarest. No explanation was 
given for the race disparity amongst victims. Also, 
despite the recent abundance of teen imagery 
and underage self-produced material, participants 
still anecdotally reported most victims were 
prepubescent children. 
The profile described by the reports and our 
participants did differ on the gender of victims. 
The three reports consistently show more female 
victims. However, some of our participants noticed 
that in their experience there was an even split 
between male and female victims, while others 
reported that their cases were mostly female. 
Participants were also quick to point out each 
perpetrator typically had a type and that the online 
location at which the perpetrator was discovered 
corresponded to certain gender preferences, i.e. 
being on a ‘boy-lovers’ forum. 
The majority of our participants reported that they 
had witnessed a decrease in the average age of the 
victim, or alternatively stated this as an increase in 
very young victims, although proportionately there 
were still more prepubescent and pubescent victims. TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL22WHY AND WHEN DID THE AGE OF 
VICTIMS CHANGE?
Participants were unable to give an exact time the 
perceived change had taken place, but it seems to 
have been very recent. For example, one participant 
attributed the change to being within the past few 
years:
“I would say that there are more 
offenders who are interested in 
prepubescent [children] and, now, 
increasingly in the last number of years, 
in younger than prepubescent - so in 
infants and children basically.” 
Another participant described the same change in 
victims’ ages, but instead of an increasing amount, 
the participant saw it as a widening of an age 
preference that already existed amongst offenders:
“I think initially the ages were 
probably in, [or] heading towards, just 
[prepubescent] – probably in the 10 
to 14 kind of age group. We’re now 
seeing a lot that are shifting slightly 
downwards towards the 6 to 8 age 
group, and again, a slightly smaller 
portion that are under that, infants and 
toddlers. If you […] consider it a bell curve type of situation, the ages have 
shifted slightly younger, simply because 
in the early days, the bulk of the 
material presented was in that higher 
age group and now we’re looking at 
them being younger and, in many 
cases, [prepubescent].”
Another participant attributed the change to being a 
global phenomenon:
“…lately the victims are at younger 
ages. There is a tendency, I would 
say an early sexualisation of children, 
and it is true that we are seeing victims 
of increasingly early ages. […] that has 
also been the case [elsewhere].”
Given the international perspective of this project, it 
was interesting that some participants distinguished 
between the materials being produced in their 
country versus abroad. A participant from Colombia 
remarked: 
“[Younger material] is produced in 
other countries. It’s not Colombian 
pornography […] the pornography with 
younger kids are always produced in 
other countries.”BOX 3: CHILD CYBER CRIME GROUP
(Colombia)
The Child Cyber Crime Group within the Colombian National Police is a law enforcement agency dedicated 
to investigate online sexual exploitation of children in Colombia.
The Group provided us with a database of thousands of victims of commercial exploitation. Our analyses 
were limited to the 696 cases that involved victims of child sexual abuse material. The average age of 
victims is presented as well as the proportion of male versus female victims in the table below. Victims’ 
ages ranged from 2 years old to 17 years old with the total average age of victims being 13 years old across 
all five years. Also of note, the majority of their victims were female with only a total 13% of victims being 
males across all five years.

(France)
Point de Contact is a hotline agency in France that was established by the Association of French Internet 
Providers to enable the reporting of CSAM. The organisation works in conjunction with the INHOPE network 
to combat OCSE. 
In the year 2015, French Point de Contact handled 4,547 cases of online child sexual abuse material. Of 
these, the victims’ ages were categoriaed as infant in 96 (2.1%) cases, prepubescent in 1,836 (40.4%), 
pubescent in 1,924 (42.3%), and indeterminate in 691 (15.2%). The victims’ gender was determined in 
4,226 (92.9%) cases, and skewed heavily towards female victims, with 3,883 (91.9%) of cases involving 
girls, 233 (5.5%) involving boys, and 110 (2.6%) involving both. Age by gender was not available from the 
summary report.
Likewise, some participants felt changes in the age 
of victims might be because the laws in their country 
surrounding CSAM and the subsequent enforcement 
of those laws were the reason they were seeing 
certain types of victims. As one participated 
explained:
“In [redacted], we see more kids 
because sometimes they can avoid 
being caught. Because, usually, they 
upload the content over a foreign 
website or crowd-host platform, so they 
can easily get away [with distributing 
material without] being caught. […] 
According to our law, child sexual abuse 
content, if your only possession, is a 
very minor crime [and] the penalty is 
you just have to pay a fine.”78
When asked why they thought the age of victims 
was getting younger, there was not a consistent 
answer as to why this change occurred. A notable 
response was the appearance of new forums on 
the Dark Net targeting those with attractions to 
very young children. The following are participants’ 
commentary on the appearance of new forums on 
the Dark Net:  
“On most of the boards, it is actually 
forbidden to post anything under 
two, but in this board, [redacted], it’s 
actually the only thing that you can 
post. You have two categories. You have 
the babies, which is between zero and 
two, and then you have the toddler 
category, which is between two and 
five. This is new, actually. […] Maybe 
there were boards [before] I didn’t 
know of, but this very popular board 
dedicated to baby lovers is kind of new.”
 
 
78  The name of the country has been redacted to keep perpetrators from further exploiting this country’s laws. “I would say we’re seeing more new 
material than we have ever seen 
before. That is down to a number of 
factors. It’s down again to the increased 
access to the Internet and increased 
access to devices through which it can 
be produced. That’s one of the less 
important factors for this material. 
What’s more important is I call it the 
focusing factor. When you have facilities 
or services like we have on the Dark 
Net and have had for the last number 
of years where individuals can come 
together. They can talk about their 
sexual preferences openly. They can  
admire the abuse that each other have 
perpetrated on children through the  
material that they’re able to contribute 
to one another and to distribute 
between one another. When you have 
forums and website available where 
they cannot be, or at least believe that 
they cannot be, traced, then those 
factors all become multiplied. The 
willingness of individuals to encourage 
others to produce material, to produce 
the material themselves, and to post it, 
and then to talk about that among each 
other is increased in those forms.”
Further discussion around Dark Net forums 
dedicated to extremely young victims suggested 
that they did not exist a few years ago and 
investigators are only now uncovering these sources 
for younger content. Furthermore, participants 
implied perpetrators might feel a sense of safety 
in discussing their attraction to extremely young 
children within these forums as well as encouraging 
each other to produce this material since such topics 
had previously been too taboo to even discuss on 
prepubescent forums.  
 TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL24However, the Dark Net was not the only reason 
cited for the decrease in age. Another participant 
reported that the change may be due to ‘mandatory 
reporting’ laws. Mandatory reporting laws require 
individuals to report if they learn or suspect a child 
has been abused or neglected. These laws have led 
to a significant increase in reports of child sexual 
abuse. The rationale is that perpetrators might find 
it is easier to molest a child who is too young to 
speak and, thus, cannot complain or suggest they 
have been abused. If they are unable to express 
that they have been abused, an adult or caregiver 
in that child’s life is unlikely to make a report to the 
authorities. 
Another explanation was that perpetrators and 
consumers are seeking new and more extreme 
content. 
“The victims can only get so young. We 
have seen the abuse of babies and very, 
very young toddlers depicted. That’s going to play off because they can’t get 
any younger than that. We’re seeing 
that it has. [We are at] that point where 
the material is depicting the abuse for 
what it is, rather than trying to sugar 
coat is as smiling, happy faces, happy 
family time kind of thing.”
We also asked about the youngest victim 
participants had seen, and every participant had 
come across material involving an infant or toddler  
during their career, even those who did not think 
there had been a change in the age of victims. 
Several participants reported that the youngest 
child they had seen was days, weeks, or only a 
few months old. These extremely young children 
prompted the law enforcement agents to prioritise 
cases that involved younger children, especially 
when they believe the content was new or that the 
child may still be alive.

Mantel-Haenszel Chi-Square p < 0.001BOX 5: GUARDIA CIVIL
(Spain)
The Technical Unit of the Judicial Police within the Civil Guard – Division of Children and Sexual Exploitation 
of Children, is a law enforcement agency in Spain.
Only partial descriptive analysis was possible with this limited dataset. While conclusions should not be 
drawn, the analysis did not seem to indicate an increase in the number or proportion of cases involving 
infants. The first table below shows infant cases as a percentage of total cases over a six-month period. 
Overall, among unique hashes, 8.7% had an infant victim. Victims again skewed towards being female, and 
cases involving infants even more so. 72.4% of non-infant cases were female, compared to 85.0% of infant 
cases. 19.2% of non-infant cases were males and 8.5% had victims of both genders, compared to 8.8% male 
and 6.3% both for infant cases.
The Guardia Civil uses a 6-tier severity score to rate child sexual abuse content. Cases involving infants tend 
to feature more severe content, i.e. penetration and adult on child activity instead of suggestive posing 
and/or child on child activity. These differences were statistically significant using the Chi-square test (see 
bottom table).TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL26EXPLORING CHANGES IN THE SEXUAL 
CONTENT OF MATERIAL
In addition to the age of victims decreasing, there 
may be a connection between younger victims and 
more aggressive sexual content. Egregious sexual 
content was often limited to investigations on 
more private platforms or platforms that protected 
offenders’ identities, such as the Dark Net. The 
Canadian Centre for Child Protection also found 
a correlation between the age of victims and the 
severity of content in their report79 They found that 
younger victims experienced higher proportions of 
explicit and extreme sexual assault. Similar findings 
have been reported by the recent study conducted 
by ECPAT and Interpol on unidentified victims in 
child sexual exploitation material stored in the ICSE 
Database.80
Descriptions of the sexual behaviour perpetrated 
against younger children by our participants ranged 
from close-ups of genitals to forceful and sadistic 
activity. Some investigators felt there had been a 
shift from ‘older’ CSAM methods that would involve 
dressing up children and making the engagement 
seem enjoyable or pleasurable for the child whereas 
images nowadays depicted the abusive nature of act 
themselves.
“I would say that [the material] is 
becoming more and more aggressive. 
For example, […] before August 2015 
we didn’t analyse any images in TOR, 
so that might change my opinion. 
Because in torrent, 90% of content is 
[...] penetrative. In TOR, the images and 
the videos are […] the worst.”
Differences in distribution methods have been linked 
to differences in offenders and offense types in USA 
based investigation81 Likewise, NetClean’s qualitative 
study similarly found that “63% of [police] say 
anonymization technologies were a crucial challenge 
to identifying offenders who have produced child 
sexual abuse material”.82 They specifically comment 
on the difficulty that TOR presents, which was 
expressed by some of our participants as well. 
Several participants attributed the more aggressive 
activity to the false sense of security that the Dark 
Net gave them.

law enforcement. They do [enforce the 
law] and work there, and they try to 
get the offenders caught, but it’s really 
difficult, because it’s difficult to trace. 
In a way, you can share totally illegal 
material, and it’s not safe, but, in a 
way, it’s easier. You don’t get caught, 
so it’s easy. […] Why is it aggressive? 
They have the opportunity to produce 
aggressive material, and they think 
it’s really difficult to get caught. I think 
[it’s also the fact] somebody will pay a 
great amount of [money] if you produce 
aggressive material.” 
One participant perceived the online culture as 
apparently rewarding the production of younger, 
more aggressive material. The participant described 
the behaviour by saying:
“I think the more you can produce or 
exchange, the worst you can show 
to your other groups or to the other 
members of these groups, you can 
rise in the ranking or you get more 
members.”
Beyond sexual activity alone, another noticeable 
change was perpetrators disgracing their victims’ 
bodies with words:
“In recent years, the content, the 
photos by themselves are getting 
high, and the sexual activity is getting 
lewd, so we can see [offenders] put 
objects into children’s vaginas, or they 
will over... We saw some cases lately, 
[offenders] writing some words on 
children’s bodies, not good words, 
[words] like ‘bitch’. […]’She loves to 
be doing this’. So it’s not just sexual 
activity, it’s getting cruel.”
Writing words, phrases, and usernames on children’s 
bodies was also suggested as a way to prove to 
other members the material was new, belonged 
to a certain producer, or fulfilled a sort of bragging 
right. Anecdotally, it has been suggested that 
producers are scrubbing images of identifiers and 
EXIF data to protect themselves from being traced, 
so it is surprising that producers would be willing 
to risk purposefully placing an identifier to recruit 
new members or achieve a higher rank within their 
member groups.TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL27BOX 6: CHILD RESCUE COALITION
(USA)
Child Rescue Coalition is a non-profit organization that partners with US and non-US investigators, police 
officers, and other key stakeholders to aid in the apprehension and conviction of child abusers. They mainly 
provide technological assistance as well as host a large database of CSAM hash values.
The US Child Rescue Coalition were able to provide us with a summary of categorised, new file hash values 
for the past 12 years across five categories, summarised in the table below. A hash value, in this context, 
represents an image that is known to contain illegal content. The data show the proportion of child notable 
material compared with other categories of values. Child notable material involves children age 12 and 
under. However, the organisation primarily focuses their investigative efforts on prepubescent children. 
Therefore, it is expected that the majority of images they collect will be denoted as child notable.

While the majority of participants felt the sexual 
activity had become more severe, some felt there 
had not been a noticeable difference. They still 
saw aggressive sexual activity being perpetrated 
against victims of all ages, but not a stark increase 
in violence or violence against a specific age group. 
A participant who felt the activity had remained 
constant (no more or less aggressive than in 
previous years) described content relating to age in 
the following way:
“We’ve seen cases of toddlers being 
abused. Rarely, rarely to the point of 
actual penetration, but clearly the 
offenders genitals are visible, placed 
somewhere over the victim. That is 
the kind of aggressive material we 
can witness with regards to toddlers. 
I find that the content involving male 
offenders and young prepubescent 
victims particularly aggressive because 
of the nature of the act. Because 
these children are clearly under age. 
In comparison it does seem a lot more 
shocking than when you see a

 pubescent victim who could be 18,  
but appears to be a minor. We are 
still obliged to qualify it as child abuse 
material. It’s not exactly the same type 
of abuse we witness in that case.”
 
Differences in experience and perspectives of the 
trends such as these highlight the utility in assessing 
sexual activity with the scales that have been 
developed. 
UNCOVERING THE TYPICAL OFFENDER
While the literature has focused on convicted sex 
offenders, the law enforcement agents and hotline 
analysts we spoke with gave insight into both 
detected and undetected offenders. They suggested 
offenders continue to grow more and more 
protective of their identities as technologies and 
investigative techniques advance. Every participant 
said it was rare to see an offender’s face nowadays, 
and when an offender’s face is visible, those tend to 
be adolescent offenders or ‘rookie’ offenders. For 
the most part, offenders only showed body parts  
 TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL28and made sure no personal identifiers (i.e. scars, 
tattoos, deformities) were visible. 
“It’s extremely rare that we can see the 
offender. If we can see him, it’s only 
parts of his body, or if it’s the whole 
silhouette his face will usually be hidden 
under a mask. We hardly ever see the 
face of an offender.”
Consensus amongst interviewees was that most 
men acted alone – either purchasing sex from 
children (a problem in low-income countries), 
extorting children online through social media, or 
grooming children they were close to (i.e., family 
members). The relationship between offender 
and child changes depending on which of the 
aforementioned situations is taking place. Offenders 
of younger children tend to be intimate, with one 
participant acknowledging:
“You know, with younger kids, it 
often is either some kind of a familial 
relationship or something close to 
that like a boyfriend or something, in 
terms of having actual access to the 
child, especially at a younger age, or 
maybe we’ve seen a couple where it’s 
babysitters, but I’d say mostly it’s more  
familial relationships for the younger 
ages because of course, as soon as you 
get into the online abuse and grooming 
and things like that, it’s going to be 
total strangers rather than somebody 
that they actually know”.  
Unlike victims where participants discussed common 
characteristics, giving profiles that were supported 
by other reports, many participants felt there was 
no common characteristic amongst offenders. The 
participants who gave an offender profile often 
mentioned older males, probably in their 30s to 50s, 
who were white - a typology of convicted offenders. 
Women appear to be very rarely involved in the 
production of material, though some said they were 
starting to see women produce CSAM, especially 
when being coerced by a man (such as a boyfriend) 
or for money. One participant echoed this notation, 
stating:
“I would say [there is a] tendency for 
female offenders to accept for profit, 
because we now see an area where 
mothers are abusing children on 
[webcam] or live shows for money. 
[…] I would say the [CSAM] produced 
by women is always --as I know of— 
[coordinated by a man].”
 
 
84  Netclean. “Eleven Unbelievable Truths”. 16A few participants did imply there were times they 
saw women acting of their own volition, but again 
women were considered maybe ‘1 in every 100’ 
offenders, if that. Some participants reported that 
they never actually saw women.
IDENTIFYING PRODUCTION AND 
DISTRIBUTION METHODS
Though it is generally understood that child sexual 
abuse material is produced and distributed in a 
variety of ways, participants described investigative 
efforts as being a constant race to outpace new 
methods. 
A notable difference between today’s producers 
and old producers, are the number of mediums 
available. Participants mentioned that technology 
like digital cameras, laptops, and cell phones have 
greatly influenced who produce images. Though 
there may be some evidence that higher quality 
images are considered more valuable, cell phones 
and webcams seem to have become the norm. This 
finding is again supported by the qualitative study 
of police that found “mobile phones and videos are 
becoming increasingly common in investigations”.84 
In particular, they allow perpetrators to offend in 
their own homes and at their convenience, which 
may contribute to the age of children decreasing.  
 
A participant explained the biggest change he had 
experienced: 
“From the top of my head, I’d say 
more and more amateur content [is 
being produced]. Meaning home, self-
produced content, unfortunately. This is 
parting with the given impression that 
CSAM is something that you maybe 
find in more exotic countries, typically 
Eastern Asia with sex tourism. The 
fact is, we see more, if we’re talking 
about ethnicity here, we’ve seen a lot 
of Caucasian / white children being 
abused by what seems to be a parent 
or a close relative within the framework 
of a household. That’s what I refer to 
when I say amateur content.”
Likewise, distribution methods have grown. 
Distributors were characterised as being fluid and 
a step ahead of investigators. They often exploited 
new technologies and deftly used apps’ and other 
networks’ privacy policies to their advantage. A 
participant described distribution in the following 
way:  
 TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL29“It changes all the time. I mean, the 
last couple of weeks we had a high 
number of cases in Snapchat. It’s very 
newly used by [offenders]. Yeah, I think 
it changes a lot. It changes every week, 
I think, by the numbers, and every 
application. […] I think [the dark net] 
is still a high number. Peer to peer is 
same, constantly used.”
Another participant explained the popularity of live 
streaming, a distribution method that has only very 
recently become prominent: 
“I think yes, [distribution] changed a 
little bit. Not just a little, quite a bit. 
Live streaming is I think a big issue. A 
live stream abuse, or a distance abuse, 
when children are put into prostitution 
or forced into prostitution in different 
parts of the world – Southeast Asia, 
Africa, South America – things like that. 
And somebody in other continents 
would pay to view this. […] So those 
observers, payers, watchers, whatever, 
they would gather those videos for their 
own purposes, as they paid for them.”
Live streaming presents a particularly challenging 
situation to law enforcement, because if produced 
properly, there is no evidence that the crime ever 
existed, even though law enforcement may see 
evidence of money transfers and call times. Likewise, 
without witnessing the abuse, it is difficult to charge 
consumers with ‘possession’ of CSAM since there 
is no actual recording left. Furthermore, it has the 
potential to cross international jurisdictions as well 
as involve requesting assistance from the webcasting 
service. 
There also seems to be vast differences in the type 
of content hosted on each platform. As mentioned 
earlier, more aggressive and younger content are 
found on more secure places, like the Dark Web.
“The younger victims would tend to 
be in the areas that have the greater 
levels of security, and that community 
element. The overt kind of open 
platforms such as social networks and 
your standard Internet platforms would 
tend to be slightly older victims. It 
comes down to the degree of comfort 
that the individual has in terms of the 
platform they’re using and the way they 
discern the age of the victim.”
 
 
 
 “Interviewee: it has differences, because 
the pornography or the materials that 
you can find on the deep web, on the 
dark web is [more] aggressive than the 
pornography that you can find on the 
social media.
Interviewer: Are they different with 
ages and gender as well, not just sexual 
content?
Interviewee: They are younger.
Interviewer: Why [do you] think that 
they are different? Why is social media 
different than the other places?
Interviewee: It depends. […] On the 
social media they have to be more 
discreet. They have to be careful with 
the things that they are doing versus 
[other areas of the web]. Because on 
the other [websites] they don’t have to 
be careful because […] the material is 
very dark, like they are very safe.”
Anonymity, sense of safety, and more extreme 
content tend to be common characteristics of 
material distributed on the dark web. Social media 
seems to be a place where participants found older 
victims or less aggressive CSAM. These differences in 
content and victims suggest that there may be room 
for further investigation to develop risk profiles and 
investigative hierarchies.  
 
IMPACTING POLICY
Participants expressed improving policy on three 
levels: globally, nationally, and locally. Globally, 
participants wanted greater collaboration between 
law enforcement agencies during investigations. 
Some investigators related frustrations over their 
inability to secure search warrants in a timely 
manner, or hitting severe roadblocks due to 
paperwork and legalities that inhibited them from 
effectively cooperating with other investigators on 
cross-boarder cases. Furthermore, participants had 
mixed feeling about industry partners. Some felt 
they made their job easier, while others found them 
to be obstacles. A participant eloquently stated his 
opinion on the topic:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL30“We’ve all heard the phrase ‘You can’t 
prosecute your way out of this issue’. 
There is a need for a multi-disciplinary 
approach to looking at this type of 
thing, especially where we overlay 
the idea that a lot of the material is 
generated out in areas where extreme 
poverty exists, and this is a way of 
remedying that poverty, as a way 
of physically trafficking children, or 
digitally trafficking children through, 
like webcams. In terms of the offending, 
there needs to be tools that allow law 
enforcement to work together across 
jurisdictional boundaries much more 
effectively. There needs to be tools 
in place that allow the investigations 
to be done in a timely and effective 
way. There needs to be tools that 
allow case referrals to happen very 
quickly. Legislative tools that allow 
law enforcement to get subscriber 
information from other jurisdictions 
easily and quickly, and get information 
out of service providers easily and 
quickly.”
Nationally, participants wanted databases to be 
implemented and maintained. They also desired 
stricter laws for people who perpetrate these 
crimes. They felt they were often stunted by the 
ways they were allowed to investigate material 
online in comparison to other fields and wanted to be given more freedom in their approach to taking 
down material, conducting sting operations, and 
probing leads. A participant highlighted this notion:
“This is a topic I really feel that it hurts 
everyone, that as societies makes us 
look very bad. And, at the end of the 
day, the effort and the sum of all, 
not only the police. This is a job that 
must be done from different areas, 
from different strata. Both in society 
and government, and industry in the 
private sector, in companies. We all 
have a substantial responsibility in 
this. And I think that the dissemination 
of information of what is happening 
really is fundamental. Let people know 
that simply downloading a single 
image containing such is a crime and, 
therefore, can go to jail. I think that is 
fundamental. I think people need to 
know that this is a crime, a crime that 
is paid and paid dearly. People go to jail 
for doing this kind of behaviour.”
Locally, participants consistently brought up needing 
more resources and funding. They felt that while 
many people and politicians recognise online child 
sexual exploitation as a problem, they never allocate 
the appropriate funds for training, staffing, and new 
technologies. Addressing those concerns would be 
paramount in ensuring that law enforcement can 
effectively do their jobs. TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL31As noted across the reviewed literature, the 
interviews with law enforcement and the limited 
complementary quantitative data presented 
here, CSAM crimes are varied and subject to 
change, terminology differs across researchers 
and practitioners, and inconsistent ways of 
operationalising and measuring CSAM makes 
comparison across studies difficult. This has had a 
negative impact on global efforts at data collection 
across different forms of child sexual abuse and 
exploitation and is evidenced to be the case with 
online CSAM. Our capacity to evaluate the scale of 
the problem in terms of the quantity of CSAM is 
compromised by the volume of online content in 
the open, and also hidden, Internet, and the reality 
that content may be removed but not destroyed and 
copied endlessly. To date we have been dependent 
on criminal justice records and public reports to 
hotlines (as well as proactive searching) for data, 
but both are subject to biases, and are likely to 
underestimate the volume of CSAM in circulation. 
Studies using data sourced from existing databases 
(such as ICSE) also face challenges as the data was 
not collected for research purposes but rather for 
operational reasons and reflects the vagaries of 
reporting and managing missing information. 
What we can conclude is that criminal justice data 
from public records, as well as research surveys, 
would suggest an increase over time in the number 
of CSAM crimes. However, some of this data is now 
quite old, and public records also reflect changes in 
legislation and recording of crimes across different 
jurisdictions. It is also difficult to unpick whether 
the increases in recorded CSAM crimes reflect 
an overall increase in these crimes, or a greater 
investment by law enforcement (possibly aided by 
technological tools) to detect and prosecute them. 
Youth-produced images also pose new challenges 
for law enforcement in terms of resource demands 
alongside their ability to determine the age of the 
child and whether they have been produced as part 
of coercive activity by adults or peers, or represent 
behaviour that is consistent with adolescent 
development and risk-taking. 
Mapping of existing national and international 
CSAM databases would suggest that they fall 
largely into two groups: hash collections and image collections. While there are a number of databases 
globally, there is limited connectivity between them. 
Differences in how data is defined and recorded 
means that it is impossible to draw firm conclusions 
as to whether there have been changes in the 
gender, age and level of violence within recorded 
CSAM. There is some suggestive evidence that the 
percentage of egregious images has increased over 
time, but inconclusive evidence in whether there are 
changes in the ages of children, except that since 
2011 there appears to have been an increase in 
the volume of CSAM involving pubescent children, 
thought to be linked with trends in growth of self-
produced content (facilitated by wider access to 
new technologies). Across three studies, younger 
victims are associated with greater levels of sexual 
violence, produced within a family context and 
more likely to be widely distributed. However, the 
preponderance of images is of pubescent and pre-
pubescent children and the numbers of images of 
very young children (infants and toddlers) remain 
relatively low. What is consistent across different 
datasets is that the majority of victims and offenders 
are white Caucasians, and while there has been 
an increase in other ethnic groups, these number 
remain disproportionately small. This does require 
further investigation given the increasing availability 
of Internet connectivity through hand-held devices 
and the concerns expressed about, for example, live 
streaming of sexual abuse. 
The qualitative results from expert interviews 
confirm the study hypothesis that victims of OCSE 
appear to be getting younger, and the decline in age 
has happened recently. However, this is far from 
clearly confirmed. The 2016 report from the IWF 
suggested a decline in the percentage of reported 
images of children under 10 from 80% in 2014 
to 53% in 2016, and a corresponding increase in 
victims aged 11-15 (18 to 45% respectively). The 
IWF concluded that this may relate to the increase 
in youth-produced images alongside the fact that 
since 2014 IWF analysts have been allowed to 
proactively search for content. The public are more 
likely than analysts to report children under the age 
of 10, and where there is more severe abuse. When 
IWF analysts find a forum with thousands of images 
of child sexual abuse, they work to remove the 
forum as well as capture the URLs of every image 4. CONCLUDING DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONSTRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL32on there (which might be pulled from another site). 
They then seek to remove each image hosted on 
the other sites as well. The IWF conclude that this 
technique appears to be associated with finding 
more images of 11 to 15-year-old children.
The experts within the study had not reached a 
consensus as to why they concluded that the age 
of victims is decreasing, but one suggestion was 
the appearance of new forums on the Dark Net 
specifically dedicated to younger children, which 
did not previously exist. Such a market place was 
thought to naturally encourage the production 
of new material as well as facilitate its sharing. 
The Dark Net is seen as a notorious safe house 
for some of the most egregious content, and as 
law enforcement and hotline analysts begin to 
specifically target these forums, it is speculated 
that they will undoubtedly see an increase in 
young victims. Another explanation given for the 
decreasing age of victims was that offenders have 
gained a sense of safety and confidence on private 
platforms (e.g. live streaming) that make it easier to 
produce violent material. 
When participants discussed distribution methods, 
some mentioned outdated policies and legislation 
that inhibited them from being proactive in 
investigations. Similarly, a few participants suggested 
that investigative efforts have continued to be 
blocked by companies and countries that do not 
fully cooperate with law enforcement. Despite the 
ongoing international dialogue around child online 
sexual exploitation, participants believed that the 
public appears to misunderstand the gravity and 
implications of restricting investigations.
 Participants also emphasised the fact that additional 
funding would significantly help their investigative 
teams. Funding would address the majority of issues 
participants had with current practices; it would 
allow them to add staff members, in turn processing 
more cases, build national databases of images 
and videos, and appropriately train staff. It was 
felt that drastic increases in the number of cases 
reported each year and lack of funding have left 
professionals with little ability to implement valuable 
resources, such as the development of a national 
image databases, as well as annual staff training. 
Furthermore, it was suggested that efforts should 
be made to encourage collaboration between 
researchers, advocates, and law enforcement agents 
so that the field can continue to grow and promote 
best practices.
LIMITATIONS
When recruitment began for the quantitative 
portion of the study, invitations and flyers were 
distributed to law enforcement and hotline agencies 
around the globe requesting data on online sexual 
abuse images. These initial invitations yielded very 
few responses. Upon further probing, it appeared 
many countries lacked the funding and staff 
needed to maintain national databases, especially 
databases that would retain the level of detail our 
research team desired to establish standards for 
evidence-based advocacy and programming. As 
one agent acknowledged, even if his department 
was presented with additional funding, he would 
probably dedicate the funds to more investigative 
staff rather than sacrifice a team member to data 
entry and management. Other departments and 
organisations were advocating for or had recently 
received funds to establish national databases but 
were still in the beginning phases of designing and 
implementing their databases.TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL336. RECOMMENDATIONS
Law enforcement agents and hotline analysts are 
seeing changes in CSAM. However, expert opinions 
are not sufficient to establish global metrics; 
substantial quantitative data is necessary. As the 
limitations of this study suggested, there are still 
many barriers to overcome before global metrics 
and/or indicators can be developed.
 
RECOMMENDATION 1:  
Invest in the development and maintenance of a 
national database of CSAM in each country.
It is difficult to determine the cost-benefit ratio of 
agencies dedicating staff time as well as their often 
limited funds to maintaining a national database. 
However, to more effectively establish global 
trends in OCSE, it is crucial that law enforcement 
agencies throughout the world have databases or 
the ability to track relevant information about the 
material they process and investigate, including 
characteristics of offenders, victims, and the sexual 
activity depicted in the imagery.
RECOMMENDATION 2:  
Track and analyse trends in CSAM data nationally 
and globally.
Governments must track and analyse trends 
in CSAM data both at national levels and in 
cooperation with international law enforcement to 
better understand and therefore more effectively 
fight OCSE.
 
RECOMMENDATION 3:  
Promote participation in research by law 
enforcement agencies.
The benefits of evidenced-based advocacy and 
action are far reaching but collaboration is often 
restricted by the need to negotiate complex ethical 
processes associated with sharing sensitive data, 
or simply from a lack of resources. There are clear 
opportunities to foster collaboration between law 
enforcement agencies and professional researchers that would benefit both partners. Researchers 
and advocates should work to strengthen their 
relationships with law enforcement agencies and 
hotlines in order to facilitate such projects.
RECOMMENDATION 4:  
Move towards standard variables for collecting, 
storing and analyzing CSAM data.
Analysis of limited quantitative data allowed the 
research team to test assumptions about how law 
enforcement agencies collect and store CSAM data. 
It was assumed that agencies would vary slightly in 
how they collected, coded, and defined variables. 
However, vast differences were noted in what 
organisations considered important to include in 
their databases and how they maintained them. 
Some variables will need to be standardized across 
databases for global metrics to be achieved.
RECOMMENDATION 5:  
Consult stakeholders from around the globe 
to develop a set of basic shared variables and 
promote agreement to store CSAM data in line 
with these.
Bringing together key stakeholders to define 
variables and standardise the way data is captured 
within databases would assist investigators, 
advocates, and researchers in establishing and 
comparing trends. It is not enough to have large 
databases with lots of variables, rather we need 
robust databases with useful, and carefully defined 
variables to better understand and more effectively 
act to prevent this crime from happening.

Point de Contact (France)
Point de Contact is a hotline agency in France that was established by the Association of French Internet 
Providers to enable the reporting of CSAM. The organisation works in conjunction with the INHOPE network 
to combat OCSE. 
Point de Contact provided a summary report on cases reported to the hotline by year from 2010-2015. This 
report describes: a) the total number of reported cases by Internet service type (e.g. website, P2P , forum, 
etc.), b) the number of cases in each broad content category (e.g. ‘child pornography’, child nudism, adult 
pornography accessible to children, etc.), c) the number of cases from each country of origin, and d) the 
action taken by the agency on each case. 
Point de contact was unable to provide victim details (such as age or gender). However, these data can be 
used to inform how CSAM comes to the attention of a national reporting hotline, and to help identify gaps 
that might exist in law enforcements’ current approach to identifying exploitive images. 
Point de Contact also provided a summary report of information hosted in France provided by INHOPE for 
the months of Jan-Nov 2015. The report describes the total number of actions taken by French authorities, as 
well as the gender and age distributions (infant, prepubescent, pubescent) of cases. The data supplied only 
spans the past year, so it was impossible to determine temporal trends. 
Guardia Civil (Spain)
The Technical Unit of the Judicial Police within the Civil Guard – Division of Children and Sexual Exploitation of 
Children, is a law enforcement agency in Spain.
Guardia Civil provided a partial database from 2008 to 2016 that describes online material that the police 
have investigated. At the time of data collection, this agency is in the process of categorising their data, and 
so additional data might be available at a future point. From the data provided it was unclear how much data 
from each year had been included in the dataset.
For all investigated material, this database included the six-month window in which the material 
was identified (e.g., July-Dec 2014), both a broad content description (e.g., ‘sexual activity between 
children’,’sexual activity between an adult and child’) and more specific content description, victim age 
categories (0-13 years, 13-18 years) and whether an infant appears in the content. 
These data are the most pertinent to the primary research question. While offender information and other 
victim demographic information (e.g. race) are missing, the content descriptions may provide an opportunity 
to examine temporal trends in content severity and the presence of young children. 
Child Cyber Crime Group - Colombian National Police
The Child Cyber Crime Group within the Colombian National Police is a law enforcement agency dedicated to 
investigate online sexual exploitation of children in Colombia.
The Child Cyber Crime Group provided a database of Colombian victims of sexual exploitation from 2010 to 
July 2016. Given that not all the cases pertained to online child exploitation, our investigation was limited to 
cases denoted as victims of CSAM. Victim age and gender are summarised by year. These data are extremely 
useful for our primary research question; however, there are too few cases to detect statistically significant 
differences. However, we do see agreement between interviewers and the national database. TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL41Child Rescue Coalition (United States of America)
Child Rescue Coalition is a non-profit organization that partners with US investigators, police officers, and 
other key stakeholders to aid in the apprehension and conviction of child abusers. They mainly provide 
technological assistance as well as host a large database of CSAM hash values.
Child Rescue Coalition provided us with a brief data summary from 2004 to June 2016 that describes the 
number of new image hash values they categorised each year from law enforcement. While this agency has 
access to millions of hash values of CSAM, they do not collect detailed information on victims and, therefore, 
could not help us answer our primary research question. The summary data they provided us categorises 
material into five areas: 
 Child notable – abuse imagery depicting visually prepubescent children, 
 Age difficult – abuse imagery depicting post-pubescent victims still believed to be under 18 years of 
age, 
 Child erotic – imagery depicting nude children not considered to be a lewd display, and 
 Child cartoon erotic–cartoon images produced to show children (or children characters) in sexual 
situations. ECPAT International
