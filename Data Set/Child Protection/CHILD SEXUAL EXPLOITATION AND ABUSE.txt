WeProtect Global Alliance brings together experts from government, the private sector 
and civil society to develop policies and solutions to protect children from sexual 
exploitation and abuse online. 
The Alliance generates political commitment and practical approaches to make the digital 
world safe and positive for children, preventing sexual abuse and long-term harm.
ECPAT International is a global network of civil society organisations working towards the 
vision of ending the sexual exploitation of children. With over 30 years of experience in 
engaging with and managing multi-stakeholder processes and alliances across national, 
regional and global levels; ECPAT is considered to be at the helm of all issues and 
manifestations pertaining to the sexual exploitation of children. With a Secretariat based 
in Bangkok (Thailand), driving strategic direction, producing key research and working on 
global advocacy; together with the on-the-ground efforts of 122 members in 104 countries, 
the network approach bridges local communities, governments and the private sector; 
offering a global approach combined with customised national actions. 
In recent years, important achievements have been made in the areas of prevention, 
legislative protection, child participation, research as well as collaboration with private 
companies in the travel and tourism sector in the fight against the sexual exploitation of 
children in such context, both at the national level and in the main tourist destinations of 
the country.
Fundación Renacer  is a non-governmental organisation active since 1988 in Colombia to 
prevent and eradicate the commercial sexual exploitation of girls, boys and adolescents 
in any form. The work of Fundación Renacer follows three lines of action: comprehensive 
care for victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation, prevention and research. This social 
organisation is a pioneer in the country, due to the development of comprehensive care 
and protection models and also protection environments, from a rights, gender and 
differential approach and from multisectoral and inter-institutional actions. Fundación 
Renacer has managed to develop advocacy actions to strengthen public policies to 
address these issues and has consolidated strategies in an articulated manner with the 
government sector, private sector, community, civil society and adolescents and young 
leaders in various departments, cities and municipalities of Colombia.FUNDACIÓN

Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaDefining child sexual exploitation and abuse online
Child sexual abuse refers to various sexual activities 
perpetrated against children (persons under 18), regardless 
of whether the children are aware that what is happening to 
them is neither normal nor acceptable. It can be committed 
by adults or peers and usually involves an individual or group 
taking advantage of an imbalance of power. It can be committed 
with or without explicit force, with offenders frequently using 
authority, power, manipulation, or deception.¹
Child sexual exploitation involves the same abusive actions. 
However, an additional element must also be present - 
exchange of something (e.g., money, shelter, material goods, 
immaterial things like protection or a relationship), or even 
the mere promise of such.²
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online includes an evolving range of practices including: 
Child sexual abuse material: The production, distribution, dissemination, importing, 
exporting, offering, selling, possession of, or knowingly obtaining access to child sexual 
abuse material online (even if the sexual abuse that is depicted in the material was carried 
out offline). 
Grooming children online for sexual purposes: Identifying and/or preparing children via 
online technology with a view to exploiting them sexually (whether the acts that follow are 
then carried out online or offline or even not carried out at all). 
Live streaming of child sexual abuse: Sexual exploitation which involves the coercion, 
threat or deception of a child into sexual activities that are transmitted (‘streamed’) live via 
the Internet for viewing by others remotely. 
Other practices: Related concepts can include online sexual extortion, the non-consensual 
sharing of self-generated sexual content involving children, unwanted exposure to 
sexualised content, among others.³Child sexual exploitation 
and abuse online refers to 
situations involving digital, 
Internet and communication 
technologies at some point 
during the continuum of 
abuse or exploitation. It can 
occur fully online or through 
a mix of online and in-
person interactions between 
offenders and children.

Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaBackground
Research about child sexual exploitation and abuse online 
has received increased attention recently – particularly as our 
lives shifted further online during responses to the Covid-19 
pandemic. Research from global north countries is over-
represented on this topic, with far fewer studies taking place 
in low- and middle-income countries. A continuum exists 
for our online and offline lives which also impacts this issue 
- with blurred boundaries between our physical and digital 
worlds. Sexual violence is also taking place in different ways: 
online, as well as in situations involving online and in-person 
elements of grooming, facilitation and sharing. 
Furthermore, children’s voices about their experiences of 
these crimes continue to be rarely centralised in the dialogue 
- there is surprisingly little research directly conveying their experiences of child sexual exploitation 
and abuse online nor the responses they receive. Much of the existing research has also focused on 
identifying potential risks to children rather than directly measuring the evidence of harm that some 
have faced. This is understandable, as its ethically more complex to conduct research with young 
people who have experienced harm. Yet fully understanding online harms is important to inform 
preventions and responses. It must also be remembered that in reality, the vast majority of cases of 
child sexual exploitation and abuse go unreported, making it difficult to truly determine the scope of 
this problem in the first place. 
Researchers have used qualitative methods like online surveys to examine childhood experiences 
of sexual exploitation and abuse online – predominantly focused on survivors of child sexual abuse 
material production. In one such study, approximately half of those who responded felt that the images 
were associated with specific problems that were different to those caused by the actual abuse. Nearly 
half of the respondents worried that people would think that they were willing participants or that people 
would recognise them. Interestingly, in this study, one-third refused to talk about the images and 22% 
denied that there were images. Three themes were identified from the data: guilt and shame, their 
ongoing vulnerability and an empowerment dimension the images sometimes brought. An additional 
study of adult survivors came from the Canadian Centre for Child Protection, who conducted an online 
survey with 150 female respondents whose child sexual abuse was recorded and/or distributed online.  
Seventy per cent of that sample also expressed anxieties about being recognised from the images. 
A further qualitative study of 20 children who were referred following suspected online sexual abuse 
found that only 12 were willing to talk about what had happened. The remainder denied that anything 
had taken place in spite of the fact that there were digital images of their abuse. The interviews with 
these 12 children indicated that they were very critical of themselves, and often had strong feelings of 
loyalty towards their offender.  
The reluctance to accept, disclose, and attributions of self-blame have been evidenced in other 
research with children who have experienced online sexual exploitation, both in relation to abuse 
through sexual image production as well as online grooming. These are important lessons not only for Children’s voices about 
their experiences of sexual 
crimes continue to be rarely 
centralised in the dialogue 
- there is surprisingly little 
research directly conveying 
their experiences of child 
sexual exploitation and 
abuse online nor the 
responses they receive.8
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in Colombiaresearch studies with these hard-to-reach populations, but also in relation to the recovery needs of 
these individuals. Breaking down these common phenomena - which may be heavily internalised - is 
clearly required.
These studies notwithstanding, qualitative research with children who have experienced sexual 
exploitation and abuse online is still relatively rare. Such children are difficult to both identify and 
recruit, which in part may reflect the ethical challenges of approaching children directly, and also 
because many professionals act as gatekeepers to children and are reluctant to approach them for 
research due to justifiable fears of further traumatisation. Crucially, any such research must also be 
completed using ethically appropriate and safe techniques for engaging survivors. 
However, growing numbers of children are being supported by support services around the world for 
issues related to child sexual exploitation and abuse online. Seeking to understand and build on the 
strengths of such services and address their weaknesses is a priority. Amplifying the voices of young 
people who have had these experiences is vital for this work. 
The increasing problem of child sexual exploitation and abuse online requires detailed, extensive and 
sustained attention. This is especially the case in middle- and low-income countries, where the issue 
often lacks visibility and few studies have been conducted to date. 
Specific evidence about the quality and effectiveness of support services will enable targeted 
responses in which governments, non-governmental organisations and the private sector can 
cooperate to address this problem. 
Ensuring that the voices of children who have had experiences of child sexual exploitation and abuse 
online are part of the evidence – as was achieved in this project - enables child-centred and informed 
approaches that better prevent this issue from occurring, and better support those young people 
subjected to these crimes.9
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaThe project in Colombia
To explore child sexual exploitation and abuse online in Colombia, this project undertook two research 
activities: 
The conversations with young survivors focused on their recommendations for improving prevention 
and support services for children (not their abuse, as explained below). The approach ensured that the 
research was informed directly by survivors who were drawing on their own experiences of harm from 
child sexual exploitation and abuse online. Including their perspectives in the research bridges the 
conspicuous gaps noted above that sometimes persist in the evidence in this sensitive area.
Surveying frontline support workers aimed to provide a substantial and nuanced understanding of 
how child sexual exploitation and abuse online is presenting in social support services. Data from 
these professionals indicates knowledge and perceptions of the problem amongst workers, caregivers 
and the general public; identifies key vulnerabilities for children; and assesses accessibility of care to 
support children subjected to child sexual exploitation and abuse online. 
Data from Colombia was presented – alongside data from five other countries involved in the project4 
to a panel of experts at an online roundtable held on 26th July 2021. Insights from the roundtable 
helped frame the data in the overall project report and this and other countries’ national reports.Qualitative one-on-one

Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaConversations with survivors
The conversations with young survivors of child sexual exploitation and abuse online are of foremost 
importance to this project. They were conducted with the intention to shed light on the conspicuous 
gaps that persist when survivors’ perspectives are excluded from work to shape policy and legislation 
in this area. The conversations explored the survivors’ perceptions of the quality and effectiveness of 
existing support services, and gathered recommendations for improvements.
Rationale
Engaging survivors of child sexual exploitation in research requires substantial care to accommodate 
a range of ethical considerations.⁵ Such research must place significant value on survivors having the 
right to safely, actively and meaningfully participate in discourse on issues that impact upon them. 
Therefore, the design for the survivors’ conversations in this project was built on the principle that the 
participants had, and perceived themselves to have, significant control over the process, including 
the decisions of what they shared. A range of measures were taken that reinforced that survivors had 
full control over sharing their perspectives on their terms. 
To ensure that the perspectives of young survivors were meaningfully included in this project, ECPAT 
International developed a comprehensive, participant-centred, ethically sound, and trauma-informed 
approach to engaging them with the help of an expert who had extensive experience working with 
survivors of sexual abuse and exploitation. The ‘conversations’ approach is thus a dialogue with young 
survivors on issues which matter to them, and which explore their experiences of the support that 
they received.  
Participants were invited to speak freely about their personal experiences of support services through 
their recovery process and the facilitators used active listening to engage with the young persons and 
understand their story – exploring particular gaps in understanding and drawing out the detail needed 
to represent young people’s perspectives of these issues. Probing questions eliciting narratives across 
their experiences were only done responsively and to prompt discussion. This was not a structured 
interview with set questions – which can feel like an interrogation. Participants were invited to tell only 
the parts of their story that they wanted to. 
The conversations in Colombia were facilitated by two psychologists, a male and a female, all with 
experience in therapeutic care for child and adolescents survivors of sexual exploitation.
Sample
In Colombia, the facilitators carefully identified possible young people that could be invited to 
participate. Inclusion criteria included, inter alia, being aged between 18 to 24 years old, having had 
an experience of online sexual exploitation and abuse before turning 18 years of age as well as a need 
for participants to have current access to support structures, and for adequate time to have passed 
since the exploitation occurred.

Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaOf those identified and reached out to by the facilitators and their networks, nine survivors of child 
sexual exploitation and abuse online, 4 young women and 5 young men between the age of 18 to 23 
years old, agreed to take part in the conversations. The participants were identified through the work 
carried out by Fundación Renacer in association with the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare.
Conversations approach
The conversations were carefully planned to be conducted in an interactive and unstructured style, 
rather than a traditional form of research interview. The advantages of this design are that it is attentive 
to the nature and sensitivities of the topic, and promotes choice and empowerment, placing high 
value on the fact that participants have, and perceive themselves to have, significant control over 
what they share with the researchers.
Participants were also asked if they preferred to take part in conversations one-on-one or in small 
groups (for example in case they already knew some of the other participants because of participation 
in the same support groups). The nine young people decided to conduct one-on-one conversations.  
Following initial agreement to take part, conversations were then held in two stages – a ‘pre-meeting’ 
was carried out and then the ‘main conversation’ a few days later. This two-stage process was 
deliberate, symbolically indicating a trusting relationship controlled by the participant from the outset. 
The pre-meeting involved explaining the process, answering queries about consent, and seeking any 
preferences that the facilitators could accommodate in setting up the ‘main conversation’ (e.g. time 
of day, room and seating preferences, who was present etc.). Arrangements remained flexible and up 
to the local facilitators and the young people to determine together, also in light of the fast-changing 
contextual circumstances caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Facilitators took every measure to make sure that the survivors felt as comfortable as possible 
during the course of conversations. The conversational nature, open questions, allowing enough 
time to respond, regularly giving permission not to respond, all helped shape the outcomes of 
the conversations. As per the conversations’ approach, the young people were able to contribute 
verbally, but also encouraged to use a range of visual tools to facilitate the conversations (‘Past, Now, 
Future’ flip charts, speech/thought bubbles, emoji, drawings, etc.). The possibility of carrying out 
the conversations in three moments – past, present and future ¬– seemed to be appreciated by the 
participants as it represented an opportunity to verbalise their empowerment processes. The visual 
representation method, however, was not applied in all cases, as some of the participants were more 
comfortable with verbally expressing their thoughts. Their choices were fully accepted and respected. 
While the Covid-19 pandemic meant lots of interactions had to be virtual, the researchers were 
adamant that psychological safety would be hard to maintain in such an approach. Conversations 
were therefore all held face-to-face.⁶ Although the research did not seek to determine the specifics 
of the exploitation and/or abuse that the young women were subjected to, in this way the facilitators 
– trained and experienced in working with trauma – were physically present to provide psychological 
support if distress was encountered.
6. Some flexibility was needed to adapt to changing movement requirements and Covid-19 safety plans were applied.13
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaAnalysis
Following the conversations, the facilitators reflected on what they had heard, their notes, and 
recordings of the sessions. They developed a brief preliminary report – in Spanish – that focused on 
specific themes across the seven conversations, such as barriers to disclosing, the quality, usefulness 
and accessibility of services, and summarised the young women’s recommendations for improvements. 
This preliminary report was then reviewed and discussed between the facilitators, the project expert, 
and the ECPAT research team. Once finalised, it was made available to those participants who had 
indicated they wanted to see the output to offer their feedback and additional inputs.
Ethical considerations
Before beginning the research activity, ECPAT International convened a panel of three global experts 
for an independent third-party review of the proposed methodology. A detailed research protocol that 
included mitigations for ethical risks was developed, along with draft tools. Detailed feedback from 
the panel was accommodated in two rounds of review before the project commenced. 
As detailed above, the local facilitators participated in extensive preparations together with the project 
expert prior to conducting the conversations. Moreover, the process for obtaining informed consent 
was conducted in two steps – so the young people had time to consider their involvement (not signing 
consent just prior to commencing) and could control some of the circumstances of the conversations.
Frontline support workers’ survey
The engagement of frontline support workers through completion of a workforce survey was aimed 
at adding data to ‘flesh out’ a comprehensive picture of child sexual exploitation and abuse online by 
exploring the perceptions, knowledge and practices influencing disclosure and support provision.
Rationale
Workforce surveys have increasingly been used in research to gain an understanding of the 
effectiveness of social support systems. Most commonly these surveys are used by health7 and social 
work professions8 to measure service delivery effectiveness.
Social support to children who are subjected to sexual exploitation and abuse is generally provided 
within the broader context of child protection. We therefore developed and delivered a survey for child 
protection workers. The survey explored perceptions related to the sexual exploitation of children 
– in general and online; factors related to children’s access to support services; perceptions of the 
quality and effectiveness of such services; as well as details about the nature of their direct work with 
children.

Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaSample
Fundación Renacer utilised their national contacts to identify organisations supporting children from 
which to invite staff working at the frontline of providing support. 
While the research focus was child sexual exploitation and abuse online, very few services focus 
exclusively on support for child sexual exploitation and abuse with an online component, or even 
exclusively on general child sexual exploitation and abuse. The sample therefore included a range of 
frontline support workers who had supported at least some children subjected to sexual exploitation 
and abuse over the last year.  
A convenience sample of 89 Colombian frontline workers was surveyed. The sample should not be 
considered representative of the diversity of frontline workers in the country, however, attempts to 
represent different types of services, both in terms of geographic location as well as type of services 
were made.
In order to be eligible to complete the survey, frontline workers needed to be: 
• Over 18 years of age; 
• At least last 12 months working in the field of social work, psychology or other social support; 
• At least last 12 months managing own case load directly; 
• Case load over last 12 months included at least some children; 
• Case load over last 12 months included at least some cases of sexual exploitation and abuse of 
children.
The survey
Self-administered online surveys (emailing a link) have notoriously low participation rates. Thus, 
the design for this project opted for in-person administration ¬– though using an online tool with 
limits and designated required items for a clean dataset. While restrictions related to the Covid-19 
pandemic meant the Colombian administrators, staff members from Fundacion Renacer, had to 
support participants remotely via an introductory Zoom or phone call and then remained on standby 
to support, offer guidance and troubleshoot as the participants completed the survey. The personal 
connection helped motivate participants to complete the survey. Data collection took place between 
April-June 2021. 
The online survey consisted of 108 multiple choices and short open-answer questions. The draft 
tool in English language was translated to Spanish and ECPAT International and Fundacion Renacer 
collaborated to check and contextualise the survey, which was then pilot-tested with a small number 
of frontline workers in the country before being fielded. 
The full survey in English and Spanish can be provided on request.15
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaAnalysis
Following data collection, data was cleaned, and open-ended responses were translated to English. 
Survey output was integrated into a custom analytical framework where analysis was then conducted 
based upon exigent themes and patterns that arose from the data. Qualitative analytical components 
were then added. 
Quantitative and qualitative themes and patterns were explored, with direct (translated) quotes from 
the open text responses used to illustrate dominant narratives emerging from the quantitative data, 
along with occasional dissenting views. Care was taken during analysis not to present any qualitative 
responses that may have identified participants.  
It should be noted that the data are not statistically representative of the experiences of all frontline 
support workers in Colombia. However, the estimates, perceptions and experiences reported here 
offer valuable insight into the access and quality of social support for Colombian children who have 
experienced sexual exploitation and abuse.
Ethical considerations
Informed consent was obtained as an integrated part of the online survey tool. To protect confidentiality, 
names were not requested at any stage of completing the survey. Care is also taken when presenting 
qualitative data in this report so that participants are not identifiable by the content of the quotes.16
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaChallenges and limitations 
The Covid-19 pandemic meant movement restrictions varied at different times during the data 
collection period which had an impact both on the survivors’ conversations as well as the frontline 
workers’ survey. The facilitators overcame this challenge for the conversations with survivors by 
conducting the pre-meeting on the phone two weeks before the main conversation.
Survivor conversations were audio-recorded, but transcriptions were not completed – with the 
intention that as facilitators themselves were producing the preliminary reports, key insights would 
be easily surmised. However, in hindsight, and as the young people’s direct words were a focus, 
transcriptions would have helped to facilitate direct quotes being incorporated more easily.
The team in Colombia also noted that while the approach to conversations was carefully created to 
centre the participants, this was challenging for the facilitators to negotiate. The team suggested that 
key lines of enquiry are maybe considered as a basis for future use of the approach.
Regarding the frontline workers’ survey, a limitation occurred as a result of our inclusion criteria. Our 
intent was to include support workers who worked directly at the frontline (not higher up managers). 
Thus, a hurdle question sought experience of working directly with children “within the last 12 
months. ” As data collection occurred in the first half of 2021, the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic had 
restricted some frontline workers from doing direct client work for some time, so it is likely that some 
of the 40 participants who began the survey but were disqualified by hurdle questions may have been 
false positives. Weak Internet connections in areas such as La Guajira and the Amazon resulted into 
difficulties in administering and completing the survey. Connection issues also extended dramatically 
the time to complete the survey for some respondents, rather than 30 minutes, some reported it had 
taken them as much as 90 minutes or more to complete. 
For some government respondents working from the office at the time, an additional challenge was 
gaining access to the survey online platform as their work computers blocked access to the website.  
Finally, during the data collection period, widespread national protests were occurring and some 
potential respondents lost their employment. Rescheduling appointments was necessary throughout 
this time to meet the sample requirements. Photo by Yaopey Yong
FINDINGS18
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaThe perspectives of the young people who had direct experiences of harm from child sexual exploitation 
and abuse online are the primary data used to structure this report. Quantitative and qualitative 
data from the surveyed frontline support workers is then integrated amongst their perspectives to 
enhance a comprehensive picture of the on-the-ground situation for preventing and responding to 
child sexual exploitation and abuse online in Colombia. Public perceptions and beliefs, the knowledge 
and practices of workers, availability and quality of reporting mechanisms and the resource levels of 
support services are all presented. The report concludes with recommendations for action – these 
stem primarily from what the young people told us but are expanded in places with other data and 
analysis from the project partners.
Trends in child sexual exploitation and abuse online  
in Colombia
Gender
The survey data suggest that there is a higher proportion of girls than boys utilising formal reporting 
mechanisms and accessing support services in Colombia. In an open question, participants were 
asked if they thought there were trends related to gender and sexual exploitation (generally and 
online). Figure 1 shows that almost a half (48%) indicated that they perceived more girls than boys 
were affected:

9. Please note that text in green boxes refers to quotes from the young survivors who took part in the conversations. Text in purple boxes 
refers to the qualitative input shared by frontline workers who completed the survey.A number of respondents assumed that the low access of support services by boys would probably be 
because girls are overwhelmingly seen as more at risk in the country – for a full range of concerns, but 
also for sexual exploitation. One of them commented that:19
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaHowever, it seems that despite the perception that girls are more at risk, boys too are clearly seeking 
assistance for a range of things, including for child sexual exploitation and abuse online. Indeed, 
survey data also show that most of the frontline workers had provided some support for boys. Eighty-
three percent of the respondents (n=74) said that they had boys among their caseloads and of these, 
62 workers (84%) said that they had supported boys for sexual exploitation and abuse online. This 
was actually quite similar to the participants who had provide support to girls (87%, n=77) and most 
(n=70) had supported girls related to online forms of sexual exploitation and abuse. In line with global 
research,10 these numbers confirm that while perspectives might be boys are less impacted, caseloads 
suggest more boys than is commonly thought are impacted. 
On top of that, there were some interesting departures from expectations in the Colombia data. A 
number of respondents said that “[…] non-binary people are identified” within the support services. 
They also mentioned that 
These data confirm other research indicating that young people with diverse sexual and gender 
identities are vulnerable to sexual exploitation.11 In some cases, their diverse status may contribute 
to risks. Indeed, in the conversations, one young man who identifies himself as gay said that the 
feeling of loneliness led him into risky situations. He was manipulated by older men and got involved 
in relationships that he could not identify as abusive due to the need to reaffirm his sexual identity. 
Age
The 62 frontline workers who had worked with boys for online forms of sexual exploitation and abuse, 
reported that nearly half (47%) were targeted between the ages of 11-15 years old. The five young men 
who took part in the conversations were at a similar age to this majority when they were abused (all 
were between 13 and 17).“[…] there are confusions on sexual orientation in many of the children and 
adolescents served” and that “it is harder for the LGTBTQIA+ population to recognise 
their vulnerability [to sexual exploitation and abuse]. ”

However, the data showed that a greater proportion of the impacted boys were younger. Eighteen 
percent of the reported cases involving girls involved children under the age of eleven years old, 
compared with 27% of the cases involving boys. As one worker said, while violence against girls is 
mostly based on gender, age is what makes boys more vulnerable to sexual exploitation and abuse. 
“Yes, there are more women and girls victimised with sexual exploitation; by saying 
this, I don’t mean to say that there are no cases with boys or men; however, these are 
evidenced in relation to age, that is, there are more boys compared to adult men. ” 
Reporting mechanisms
Awareness
Conversations with the young survivors generally illustrated little awareness of the formal reporting 
mechanisms that are available. During the conversations, all the young people said that they had not 
received information about where to look for help when they were subjected to sexual exploitation and 
abuse. 
“There is no information on how to report. The girls and boys don’t report, it scares 
them, because of the process they are going to face […] One must have support 
in order to report, someone to accompany the survivor. Family support and 
psychological help are needed. ” 
(VoS-COL-06)
They also demonstrated fear of facing the bureaucratic processes often involved in formal reporting 
mechanisms. Five of the nine young people spoken to had disclosed sexual exploitation to school 
or community members who, at the time, were in charge of promoting awareness campaigns about 
this form of violence. The young people said that, once they reached out, these adults not only 
demonstrated empathy but also acted to end ongoing situations of exploitation and abuse. Non-
judgemental attitudes, careful and genuine listening, persistence, patience and friendly treatment 21
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaThe family and community members acted as mediators between the children and the formal reporting 
mechanisms, so they could gain access to the support they needed.
Unfortunately, a sense that these issues were well understood was not the rule within the young 
people’s communities. In fact, in the conversations the young people pointed out the needs to raise 
awareness and promote knowledge on how to disclose.
The lack of general public awareness was reiterated by the frontline workers who participated in 
the survey. When asked about the level of public awareness regarding online forms of child sexual 
exploitation and abuse in Colombia, the majority (74%, n=66) considered it “poor” . A smaller fraction 
of the respondents answered that it was either “fair” (17%, n=15) or “good” (8%, n=7), while only 
one person (1%) considered it “excellent” . Although this question was not specifically related to the 
awareness of reporting mechanisms, the fact that most of the frontline workers who responded to 
the survey believed that there is little awareness of child sexual exploitation and abuse online in the 
first place confirms what survivors explained – that there is likely to be very little knowledge on how 
to report if it occurs.
An interesting finding was that respondents with more years of work experience were particularly 
negative about public awareness, as shown in Figure 5 below. This could be an indication that their 
perceptions about how informed is the society changes over time, as they gain more experience in the 
field.were some of the characteristics mentioned by the young people when describing those who received 
their disclosures. One young woman said that her family members told her:
“’Always count on us, here we will be a family waiting for you so that you can recover. ” 
(VoS-COL-09)
“Because I can tell you, if a case happens in the neighbourhood, they choose violence, 
because they don’t know what else to do. If they call the police, the police in some 
cases do almost nothing, people make violence justice by their own hands. ”

A number of surveyed frontline workers proposed that more education and training is needed in order 
to increase public awareness in Colombia: 
In fact, this was a recurrent topic on survey qualitative responses as well as in the conversations. Both 
sources of data strongly suggest the need for knowledge and skills development amongst frontline 
support workers on how to identify and work with online forms of sexual exploitation and abuse: 
Another frontline worker said that:“From the training academy of the universities, there should be a chair covering 
awareness in this dimension of protection towards children and adolescents. ” 
“The challenges in terms of care is training for public servants and identification of 
cases to ensure they do not get confused with other types of violence. Having the 
support of reporting portals creates awareness among the police and state agencies 
to address these problems. ” 
“It is about the lack of knowledge about the crimes classified as sexual violence; it is 
important to provide support from prevention in order to gradually mitigate cases of 
sexual violence in a joint manner; this includes the family, the state and the society. ”23
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaIn the conversations the young people consistently mentioned the need to promote information 
and prevention on topics related to the use of digital environments. A number of them believe that 
information about it is not disseminated widely and, as a consequence, it does not reach those who 
are most at risk of online forms of sexual exploitation and abuse.
Some young people specifically raised the need to inform parents and adult family members so they 
become able to educate their children about the risks involved in the use of the Internet. According to 
one young person, the usage of mobile phones and particularly of social media should be monitored 
by caregivers, who are the utmost responsible for children’s safety online.
One young person said that promoting information about this type of violence is useful not only to 
alert people of the risks, but also to increase the reports: “Knowing about cybercrimes - that would have made me stop a bit and I would have 
realized that what was happening to me was that I was being the victim of a crime. For 
us as young people it is important to recognise the strategies that these people use to 
manipulate and deceive and thus achieve to identify and stop them. Not knowing how 
they act gives them an advantage to be able to deceive us. ” 
(VoS-COL-05)
“Parents give their children access to a cell phone to entertain themselves and they 
use it for other things; it’s a way for exploiters to get closer. Parents need to pay more 
attention and have more communication with their children. They need to teach them 
the risks of communicating with strangers; When creating an account on Facebook, 
how to use it and how to be careful (protect themselves) with social networks. ”  
(VoS-COL-06)
“The mayor’s office and the government institutions and social organisations must 
create digital programmes or permanent institutional radio or television spaces 
where they warn about the risks. More information [means] more cases reported. 
Community leaders need to be trained to help protecting children. They can identify 
victims, facilitate victims’ access to institutions. ”   
(VoS-COL-03)24
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaBarriers to disclosure
Seeking help may be a challenge due to the stigma and judgments surrounding reporting mechanisms 
and support services. Unfortunately, this stigma can come from those who were supposed to protect 
and support children subjected to sexual exploitation and abuse. Fear of being recognised, judged and 
stigmatised were main barriers to disclosure that came up in the conversations with young people. 
They described situations where they were blamed by frontline support workers while reporting:
Fear of re-victimisation and distrust of formal reporting mechanisms were also mentioned by the 
young people as barriers to disclosure. They mentioned situations in which they were forced to repeat 
their statements due to the high turnover of frontline workers, and consistently referred to fears of 
their abuse and/or exploitation being reduced to a ‘scandal’ as one of the reasons that led them to 
think: 
The barriers to disclosure were also explored in the survey with frontline workers, as indicated in 
Figure 6. The respondents were presented with a list of 18 factors that could potentially limit children’s 
disclosure of online sexual exploitation and abuse. By far, the two most commonly selected barriers 
to reporting were related to a pervasive culture of silence (“the stigma and shame that victims often 
experience”) at 58% (n=52), and to “fears about how others will respond to disclosure” , (54%, n=48). 
These accounts confirm the fears of anticipated shame and stigma associated with sexual exploitation 
and abuse. The attitudes and responses of those people charged with receiving these disclosures 
may have enormous impacts on children.“A cousin sought help for me and I went to the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare. A 
psychologist who was there offended me and told me that I was the only one to blame 
for what had happened to me. I started crying, I felt hatred for her. How is it possible 
that you go to seek help and she tells you: ‘it’s your fault?’ , That’s unethical. ”  
(VoS-COL-04)
“The fear of the report has to do with the fear of scandal. The relevant agencies 
(Colombian Institute of Family Welfare, Police, Courts) need to have more bonding 
with the victims, more support; victims don’t easily access services; they aren’t well 
cared for. Officials don’t have empathy, they don’t understand the consequences of 
violence, they re-victimise them. They lack training. There is no psychological support 
for girls and boys to come and report. ”  
(VoS-COL-10)“it’s better if I don’t report. ”

Child sexual exploitation and abuse online:

blackmailed by the offenders. One young woman said that over time, children subjected to online 
forms of sexual exploitation and abuse 
As shown in Figure 7, coincidentally, psychological support was one of the most common services 
provided by the frontline workers. When asked about the different types of direct support services 
provided by their organisations to children who have experienced sexual exploitation, two-thirds 
(66%, n=59) reported offering one-on-one counselling. The other most common service provided was 
support for families and caregivers (65%, n=58). Describing the type of service provided, one surveyed 
frontline worker said: She said that although she recognised the situation of sexual exploitation and abuse and wanted to 
escape, she could not disclose because the offender threatened her and her family.
Support services
It is essential to understand the perceived quality, usefulness and accessibility of support services 
related to child sexual exploitation and abuse online. This section presents some insights on these 
elements, followed by a more detailed overview of the different types of support services provided in 
Colombia, taking into account both the experiences of young survivors within these services as well 
as the views of frontline workers providing them.
Usefulness, quality, availability and awareness of support services
All of the young people who engaged in the conversations accessed support services from Fundación 
Renacer and Colombian Institute of Family Welfare in the city of Cartagena. They said that, once they 
knew about and accessed the services, the availability of support was very useful for them to recover. 
One young man said that the psychological support was what helped him the most:“Are trapped in fear of harming their families. ”   
(VoS-COL-07)
“I came to Renacer through a friend. At first, I didn’t want to come; but I wanted to see 
the light at the end of the tunnel. The attention was excellent. What helped me the 
most as a person was the therapeutic part, [learn] how to become a better person, 
how to love yourself, how to value yourself. ”   
(VoS-COL-03)
“Counselling is provided; they are later taken to a medical centre, followed by the 
report to the authorities; rights will be restored, and finally, family members are 
accompanied to file a complaint with the nation’s attorney general. ”27

Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaWhen asked about the quality of government activities to address child sexual exploitation and abuse 
online in Colombia, frontline workers provided some criticisms, particularly of government financial 
support. Most of the respondents (78%, n=58) rated the quality of government funding on this topic 
as either “poor” or non-existent.
The frontline workers also expressed dissatisfaction with both the availability and quality of medical, 
psychological, legal and reintegration services for children who have experienced online forms of 
sexual exploitation and abuse in Colombia. Responses on medical and psychological services were 
more positive, with around 26-32% of frontline workers rating the availability and quality of these 
services as either “good” or “excellent” . However, all four sets of services were rated as “poor” in 
terms of availability and quality by between 38%-56% of frontline workers, suggesting a broad need for 
improvement. One of them commented: Figure 8: Frontline workers’ views on the quality of government activities.

Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaTypes of support services
Psychological support 
As previously mentioned in this report, psychological support was very much appreciated by the 
young people who engaged in the conversations. All of them recognised this type of support as key to 
helping them overcome the impacts of online sexual exploitation and abuse. In the conversations, the 
young people expressed appreciation and emphasised the importance of these services for survivors 
in terms of rehabilitation and reintegration. Referring to his psychologist, one young man said: 
“She arrived and brightened my life. ”  
(VoS-COL-07)
“She [the psychologist] treated me like a human being, she made me understand that 
I was important, she showed me the things I had to overcome, she touched my heart. 
We made a good connection, it helped me to tell my mother that I was homosexual, it 
helped me to be free. ”   
(VoS-COL-04)They mentioned personal growth, self-acceptance and self-knowledge as the main accomplishments 
after going through psychological assistance. 
Indeed, surveyed frontline workers said that children who experienced online sexual exploitation and 
abuse most commonly identified counselling among their biggest needs (49%, n=45). A respondent 
elaborated that children need 
“Psychological assistance - Protective environment where children and adolescents 
feel safe from their offender. ”

Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaPsychological support was also considered essential by the frontline workers who responded to the 
survey. In the hypothetical scenarios, counselling/psychotherapy was frequently noted. For example, 
providing qualitative input on one of the scenarios,12 a worker said that 
In Colombia, it was really encouraging to see that in some cases, family members also had access to 
psychological support. In the conversations, one young woman said that in a family therapy session 
she could tell her mother about the sexual exploitation that she had been subjected to. Another one 
mentioned that all members of her support network – including mother, father, siblings and aunt – 
participated in psychotherapy sessions, which she considered essential for her recovering process as 
they created a caring and trusting relationship: 
A young man mentioned that the psychological support that he and his family received helped them 
to accept his sexual orientation and understand his situation. Describing the impact of the family 
therapeutic process, he said: 
Commenting about a situation where the family members were not involved, one young person 
mentioned feeling lonely and, once their father was included in the sessions the situation became 
better. However, some young people felt that family members could be better supported and 
monitored, particularly when they lived in other cities or were not motivated in participate in the 
therapeutic process.
12. Scenario question: Bernard, who lives in Australia, pays a 16-year-old in Colombia, Ana, to undress while they are on a video call. Do you 
believe that Ana is a victim of online child sexual exploitation or abuse? […] What practical steps would you take if you were the service 
provider supporting 16-year-old Ana?“A therapy process would have to be carried out with the adolescent so that she 
can understand that she was sexually exploited online, taking into account that 
they used this medium to obtain the material as well as a psychosocial process that 
allows the adolescent to be in a safe space. ”
“They care about me, but they give me freedom, I can go out alone; they trust me. ”   
(VoS-COL-17)
“Thanks to that, I am who I am. ”    
(VoS-COL-10)
“My family wasn’t there at the beginning, nobody found out. I had no one, I was on 
the street. Later my father got involved thanks to the intervention of social workers. 
They improved many things. The involvement of the family changed a lot; however, the 
families lacked more follow-up after discharge; a telephone call isn’t sufficient. ”    
(VoS-COL-03)31
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaThe psychological support services secured the young people’s emotional and psychological state 
in the aftermath of the online sexual exploitation and abuse experiences and were considered 
essential for their recovery process. It is worth noting, however, that the young people also noted 
that psychological services are not sufficiently accessible and available to all children who have gone 
through the experience of online sexual exploitation and abuse:
Indeed, this was the case for a number of young people who engaged in the conversations who lost 
interest in studies after facing such trauma. Some young people mentioned in the conversations that 
as part of the psychological support that they accessed, they were encouraged to go back to school 
and to improve their academic performance. 
Emphasising the importance of the personal growth obtained in her recovery process, one young 
woman said: 
The young people highlighted in the conversations the need to strengthen sexual education in schools. 
One of them described the type of sexual education that she had at school as only focused on avoiding 
pregnancy, with no mention to the risks involved in the use of the Internet or how to identify a situation 
of sexual exploitation and abuse. “There were a lot of children and very few psychologists; more therapy which is 
more continuous, intense and frequent was needed. A single psychologist had to 
attend many children. This [having more psychologists] would have helped them to 
overcome their problems more quickly. ”     
(VoS-COL-10)
“If they prepare our personal growth, we have a solid basis to go out into the world 
later on […] Personally I want to finish school, study interior design or psychology. ”     
(VoS-COL-10)
“Apart from studies and professional training, first you have to be a person”     
(VoS-COL-03)Educational and pedagogical support 
When asked what were the biggest problems shared to them by children who experienced sexual 
exploitation and abuse online, most of the surveyed frontline workers mentioned fear, trauma and 
anxiety (25%, n=23), followed by social isolation/marginalisation (25%, n=23) and lack of assistance/
information/services (18%, n=19). Providing qualitative inputs to the survey about social isolation, one 
frontline worker commented that it is 
“Not easy to go back to school. ”32
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in Colombia“Sexuality is not discussed in the family, between parents and their children, at 
school, with teachers. If sexuality was discussed more frequently, children would not 
see it as sin, as bad thing and they would not be deceived so easily. ”    
(VoS-COL-04)
“The school can play an important role; psychologists can train students as peer 
support. Older students can train children; among young people they understand 
each other more, but they must be supervised by someone. ”     
(VoS-COL-01)The frontline workers’ survey included a hypothetical scenario involving educational institutions.13 A 
quarter of the frontline workers (26%, n=24) expressed that the school should be informed whenever a 
child is subjected to sexual exploitation and abuse. When asked about the practical steps that should 
be taken to deal with such situations, one of the respondents answered:
The import role that schools could play in preventing child sexual exploitation and abuse online was 
mentioned in the conversations. One young woman proposed that educational spaces could organise 
peer support trained by specialised psychologists: 
Unfortunately, school teachers and the pedagogical staff were mentioned as not supportive of 
or cooperative with children in their experiences. One young woman told us that she used to go to 
school to escape from situations of violence within her family, but no one at school was attentive to 
the changes in her behaviour at the time. She did not know the school psychologist and did not have 
anyone to talk. School psychologists are often the first point of call for young people and can facilitate 
referral to other services. Additionally, the education system should work as a protection mechanism 
for children, enabling a sense of belonging and stability.14 Without easy access to these professionals, 
gaining entry to the support structures can be difficult, particularly as children simply do not know 
how and where to start.
13. Scenario question: Carmen is a 17-year-old student. Carmen has struggled to make good grades this year and is worried that Juan, a 
teacher who is a close family friend, will tell Carmen’s dad. Carmen offers to send Juan naked pictures if he promises not to talk to the 
family. Do you think that Carmen is a victim of online child sexual exploitation or abuse?
14. London Metropolitan University. (2017). Key messages from research on child sexual exploitation: Professionals in school settings. 5.“Psychosocial approach to obtain data on the exploitation situation; report to 
directors of the Institution; carry out an approach with the family; activate legal 
channels; awareness so that Carmen is recognised as a victim and establish the 
relevance those practices. ”33
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaLegal support 
Even though all nine young people who engaged in the conversations had received legal support, only 
three mentioned this type of assistance. In all these three cases, the young people said that the legal 
support helped them to understand that they had been subjected to a form of sexual exploitation 
and abuse. For instance, one young woman said that the legal support that she received helped her 
to feel relieved and to recognise herself as a victim, after a long time of self-blaming and self-harming 
behaviour. In another situation, a young man considered that the police and prosecutors acted 
diligently, initiating the process of restoration of his rights and prosecuting the offenders, who were 
arrested for these crimes.
 Unfortunately, noy all the experiences involving legal support were positive. One young man mentioned 
that although he did have access to this type of support, he felt left in the dark about the process, as 
those providing legal services did not communicate often with him or his family. 
As shown earlier in this report, in Figure 7, 46% (n=41) of the surveyed frontline workers reported that 
their organisations offer legal support for children who have experienced sexual exploitation and 
abuse. 
Legal assistance was among the very first steps that should be taken, according to the surveyed 
frontline workers, in all the scenario-based questions, which involved cases of child sexual exploitation 
and abuse online. When asked about the practical steps to take as service providers to help a fictitious 
female adolescent subjected to live streaming of child sexual abuse,15 legal action was raised by 60% 
of the surveyed frontline workers (n=51). Describing the necessary steps, one respondent listed:
“Immediate activation of the health channels; Initial care; Guidance to the family 
on legal actions (complaint) and process for the restoration of rights; Referral to 
psychotherapeutic care. ”

Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaFinancial support 
Frontline workers were asked whether child victims of online sexual exploitation and abuse have the 
possibility to seek formal financial compensation via civil or criminal court proceedings, whether from 
convicted perpetrators or country-managed funds. More than a half of the respondents (55%, n=49) 
indicated that they did not know the answer, while 26% (n=23) responded positively. In Colombia, 
article 11 of the Code of Penal Procedure states that all victims of any crime, once the conviction is 
final, have the right to receive compensation for the crime suffered.16

RECOMMENDATIONS 36
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaThe recommendations presented below are primarily drawn from the conversations with the young 
people who took part in the conversations. While the survey with frontline workers raised important 
issues and supported the analysis, this report seeks to privilege the voices and perspectives of 
survivors. Additional clarification and explanations from the analyses are provided in places from the 
project partners contributed during the analysis and write-up stage.
Recommendations on reporting mechanisms
1. Promote information and awareness about risks in the online environment 
related to sexual exploitation and abuse, as well as about reporting 
mechanisms and available support services when harm occurs.
It is necessary to
2. Provide educational programmes for communities and family members 
about prevention of online forms of sexual exploitation and abuse. 
For all of the young people who engaged in the conversations, the family plays an important role both 
in the prevention and protection of children. Therefore, it is crucial that family members have the 
capacity to educate children about the risks of Internet usage. It is also important that they create 
spaces of dialogue where children feel confident to disclose, and know how to guide children subjected 
to sexual exploitation and abuse in the process of reporting.“Reach the communities with the message of prevention, recognition of these 
crimes and promote reporting, allowing more and more people to learn about the 
issue, commit themselves and support the defence of children’s rights and the 
report of the offenders. ” 
(VoS-COL-02)
“Today it’s easier for the problem to arise because parents ignore the role of 
educating their children; they don’t see the dangers on social media. ”          
(VoS-COL-01)This recommendation was supported by the surveyed frontline workers. When provided the opportunity 
to share any last thoughts at the end of the survey, almost a half (45%, n=40) emphasised the lack of 
general public awareness related to this topic as a major issue in Colombia. One of them said that:
“It is about the lack of knowledge about the crimes classified as sexual violence; it is 
important to provide support from prevention in order to gradually mitigate cases of 
sexual violence in a joint manner; this includes the family, the state and the society. ”37
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaThe surveyed frontline workers also mentioned family members need to be better informed in order 
to prevent such crimes: 
In order to create these resources, one frontline worker recommended consulting children to make 
sure that their needs are taken into account.3. Improve the availability and dissemination of reporting mechanisms, 
creating child-friendly tools and making use of digital methods. 
The reporting mechanisms should be as accessible as possible and available in easy-to-use online 
formats. 
4. Impose legal duties on and promote collaboration with Internet service 
providers and social media companies. 
These requirements ensure that providers will promptly comply with law enforcement requests for 
takedown of child sexual abuse material as well as to comply promptly with law enforcement requests 
for information. This will assist investigations into crimes and limit the wide distribution of child sexual 
abuse material.  
In the conversations, young people said that social networks and other digital media do not display 
any prevention suggestions. According to the young people, they also do not respond to complaints 
other than sometimes blocking content. They therefore recommend that Internet providers should 
have visible information on the risks associated to Internet usage.“I believe that victims should be heard. Many formulations are made based on the 
thoughts of some people, without considering the needs of the victims. Resources 
for the care of children and adolescents are scarce and governments are resorting to 
stringer campaigns to position themselves politically, and to ensure resources reach 
the childhood. ”“To a large extent, crimes related to technological means give merit to the lack of 
knowledge from the legal, assistance, and guidance perspective, and the support 
that the family provides and to prevent children from becoming network victims. ” 
“Information must be increased, the permanent dissemination of digital channels or 
complaints. Create an easily accessible chat to report or make an application. ”
(VoS-COL-10)38
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaRecommendations on support services
5. Better promote the availability of a full range of specialised support 
services for children subjected to sexual exploitation and abuse online.
Any child who goes through such an experience should have access to specialists who can help them. 
These professionals should be specialised and know the specifics of these cases.  
“The care programmes which exist are insufficient, there is a need for more, 
because there are many children who come to services for help and information, 
and they don’t know how to talk and who to tell. Care centres should be developed 
in the most vulnerable sectors. ”

Lack of specialised support services was also highlighted by one surveyed frontline worker: 
A surveyed frontline worker emphasised the limited trained professionals: “One of the challenges that children and adolescents, victims of sexual abuse or 
sexual exploitation face is the late psychology support from the health sector due to 
the poor quality provided by this service and they do not have a professional hired to 
do so. ”
“The challenges in terms of care is training for public servants and identification of 
cases to ensure they do not get confused with other types of violence. Having the 
support of the pages for the reporting purposes creates awareness among the police 
and state agencies to address these problems. ”“Officials don’t have empathy, they don’t understand the consequences of violence, 
they re-victimise. They lack training. ”

and that those who have been subjected to such crimes are able to access compensation and other 
legal remedies. This would also encourage other children to report sexual abuse and exploitation.
“I believe that for this crime, despite the increased number of victims, the actions 
implemented are insufficient; the victims are unknown; there is lack of commitment 
of parents regarding prevention; there is lack of reaction of legal entities for 
the prosecution of the offenders and this last point involves a series of terrible 
consequences for the victims, on how much the population believes in the importance 
of the complaint and increases the probability of having new victims. ”You can ﬁnd more information on our website
