INTRODUCTION
Developing countries are facing the impact of mental health pro blems while confronted with
limited resources and inequities in access to mental health care (1–5). The use of Internet and
digital technologies has the potential to address these gaps, facilitating the development of more
equitablemodelsofcareinavarietyofcontexts( 6–8).
Internet and digital technologies could be a powerful strate gy for the delivery of mental health
services in low-resource settings. Although Internet-bas ed and digital interventions have shown
their potential beneﬁts in developed countries ( 8–10), there is a lack of studies in developing
countries. In particular, randomized controlled trials (RC Ts) investigating the eﬀectiveness of
Internet-basedanddigitalinterventionsindevelopingcou ntriesislacking( 11–13).Itis,therefore,

Chile is a developing Latin American country with a high
prevalence of mental disorders and marked socio-economic an d
geographical inequities in access to health care ( 14–17). Since
the 1990s, Chile has developed community-based mental healt h
services throughout the country to reduce the gap between
mental health needs and access to treatment ( 18). The public
health system, which serves approximately 70 per cent of the
population including the most at-risk groups in Chile, between
the years 2000 and 2010 increased the amount of human
resources for specialized mental health care and the number o f
mental health centers, especially in primary health care ( 18,19).
In addition, in 2006 Chile introduced a policy that guarantee s
access to and quality of care, as well as ﬁnancial protection
for prioritized diseases ( 20), including four mental pathologies
(depression in people over the age of 15, bipolar disorder,
addictions in people under 20 years of age, and ﬁrst episode
of schizophrenia). In this way, Chile provides one of the ﬁrst
examples of an evidence-based depression intervention being
scaledupinresource-constrainedsettings( 21,22).
However, after 25 years of relatively successful mental hea lth
policies, mental health in Chile still presents serious deﬁci encies
andcontinuestobeconsideredagreatchallengeforpubliche alth
(23). There is still a striking imbalance between government
spending on mental health and the related disease burden in
Chile (4). Thus, the treatment gap remains high: only 38.5% of
those with a diagnosis receive any type of mental health servi ce
(17),andtherearelongwaitinglistsforpsychologicaltreatme nts
in primary health care settings ( 23,24). This gap is unequally
distributed among social strata. Multiple socioeconomic and
territorial inequalities persist, with a high concentratio n of
specializedmentalhealthservicesinthecapitalcity( 18).
Digital technologies are highly utilized across all social strata
in Chile ( 25). This high level of digital connectivity ( 26)
has recently facilitated the development of e-mental health
interventions in an eﬀort to improve access to treatment
for diﬀerent populations across the country and to utilize
preventativemethods.
The aim of this article is to provide a description of the use
of Internet and digital technology in mental health through a

METHODS
We conducted a literature search of available source descri bing
the use of Internet and digital technologies in mental healt h
in Chile. Anticipating a small number of randomized clinical
trials, we decided to do a narrative mini-review of the liter ature.
A systematic or scoping review method was not used because
it would have required greater consideration of interventi on
eﬀectiveness. A mini-review allowed for greater discussion of
important areas in which we believe that Internet and digital
technologies could yield considerable gains toward addres sing

Study Selection and Data Collection
Process
Study selection and data collection were carried out by team s
of two reviewers in an independent manner (GR and VM, AJ-
M and PF). Study records were compiled and duplicates were
removed. The study selection process was documented using
thePRISMAExtensionforScopingReviews(PRISMA-ScR)ﬂow
diagram ( Figure1) in order to achieve a correct organization of
the procedure ( 27). If the information was insuﬃciently detailed
in the original article, we contacted the corresponding auth or
asking for the preliminary study results. Narrative technique s
were the selected approach for data analysis and synthesis, wit h

RESULTS
After the full-text eligibility assessment, we found three RC Ts
(28–30), three acceptability and/or feasibility studies [( 31,32);
Martínezetal.underreview],andthreeon-goingstudieswi thout
published results [( 33,34); Irarrázaval et al. under review]. The
responsible researcher from three studies (Gaete et al., und er
review; Martínez et al., under review; Irarrázaval et al., u nder

maincharacteristicsofeachstudyarepresentedin Table1.
Remote Collaborative Depression Care
Programs
Rojas et al. ( 28) tested the feasibility, acceptability, and
eﬀectiveness of a remote collaborative depression care (RCDC )
intervention for patients living in rural areas. The RCDC
methods used Web-based shared electronic health records
(SEHR) between primary care teams and a specialized mental
health team, remote supervision by psychiatrists through the
SEHR and/or telephone, and telephone monitoring of patients.
Once a week, the specialized mental health team reviewed data
entered into the SEHR by the primary care team, and provided
remote assistance by entering suggestions into the platform ,
and in special cases by giving indications over the telephone.
Their results showed that the RCDC program achieved higher
user satisfaction (odds ratio [OR] 1.94, 95% CI 1.25–3.00) an d
better treatment adherence rates (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.02–3.19 )
at 6 months compared to usual care. There were no statically
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in depressive symptoms between the

Martínez et al. ( 29) tested the feasibility, acceptability, and
eﬀectiveness of a RCDC intervention for adolescents with
depression. The intervention group received periodic remote
supervision by psychiatrists located in Santiago, through SE HR
and phone patient monitoring. The SEHR functioned as a
discussion forum allowing for specialists to assist primary c are
teams during diagnostic processes and treatment during the
acute phase of disorders through personalized, conﬁdential, and
real-time interaction. Phone calls to adolescents and his/ her
primary caregiver included monitoring of diﬀerent aspects
(e.g., adherence to pharmacological treatment). Primary ca re
clinicians were satisﬁed with the RCDC intervention, valui ng
the usefulness of receiving timely specialized support. Howev er,
there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in depressive symptoms or
health-related quality of life between groups. The adolesce nts
in the RCDC intervention group were more satisﬁed withpsychological assistance than those in the enhanced usual car e
group. Satisfaction with psychological care, in both groups, wa s
related to a signiﬁcant change in depressive symptomatology a t

Prevention Programs for Children and
Adolescents
In the study of Gaete et al. ( 30), researchers from Chile and
Finland collaborated on adapting Finland’s KiVa anti-bullyi ng
program ( 35) for 4th and 5th grade students in Chile and
on evaluating its eﬀectiveness in this new context. KiVa is an
evidence-based program to prevent bullying and tackle bullying
cases. Students in the full and partial KiVa groups received

Feasibility and Acceptability Studies for
Depression Management
Carrasco ( 31) studied the acceptability of an online adventure
video game as a psychotherapeutic tool for female adolescents
in psychotherapy for mild or moderate depression. As part of
the game design process, the author conducted focus groups
with adolescent females. In the game, players follow the stor y
of a female adolescent, who gets involved in interpersonal
situations that require psycho-social reasoning. The scori ng
system provides cues about positive game behavior in the
areas of: recognition and modiﬁcation of negative cognitiv e
bias; interpersonal skills and interpersonal problem solving ; and
behavioral activation and a healthy lifestyle. Fifteen ado lescent
femalesplayedthegameassuggestedbytheirtherapists.Pati ents
could play the game as many times as they wanted. The average
playtime was 11:57min ( SD=03:42). Most patients played
once, four patients played twice. The majority of patients ( n

=11) reported positive acceptability rates. This indicates tha t
most of them valued the game and that they thought that they
could obtain mental health-related beneﬁts from playing it. The
patient’s therapists were also interviewed, and all gave posit ive
feedback on the game and felt the game was useful for various
reasons (e.g., that it was possible in post-game sessions to re late
elementsofitwithaspectsofthepatients’lives).
Espinosa et al. ( 32) studied the feasibility and acceptability of

Study Protocols
The Rojas et al. ( 33) project aims to study the eﬀectiveness
of a technology-assisted training and supervision program to
enhance depression management in primary care clinics in
Santiago. In order to develop a comprehensive supervision
program, trained administrative staﬀ will contact patients
from a call center to support treatment adherence, and
psychiatrists will supervise the primary care team, using a
web-basedplatform.
The Mascayano et al. ( 34) project aims to develop and
evaluate an online intervention for preventing suicide and
improving mental health among adolescents. The program uses
a web-based platform and a mobile application to cultivate
a virtual community. It includes both informational and
interactive features, ranging from suicide prevention stra tegies
(e.g., a chat with a psychologist), to components designed to
increase interactions between participants and promote a sens e
of belonging and connection. During the intervention, two
psychologists will monitor the platform, identifying behavi ors
associated with suicide risk and proceeding to an establishe d
emergency protocol. A group of adolescents played a role in
the creation of the program and have access to the platform to
facilitatediscussions.
The Irarrázaval et al. (under review) project aims to
implement a telepsychiatry service to enhance the provision of
primary care mental health for children and adolescents livi ng
in substitute care facilities. Two primary care mental healt hteams,whoprovidementalhealthcaretovulnerablechildrena nd
adolescents, will receive bimonthly videoconference superv ision
from psychiatrists located at the Faculty of Medicine of the
UniversityofChileovera6-monthperiod.
DISCUSSION
This mini-review shows that Chile has presented a slow but
progressive development of e-mental health research. Nine
studies that used Internet and digital technologies to addr ess
mental health are presented: three RCTs, three acceptability
and feasibility studies and three on-going studies without
published results. The interventions included are heteroge neous
in terms of participants and contexts (e.g., adolescents, adu lts,
patients, professionals, rural, urban), aims (e.g., collabo rative
care treatment, monitoring relapse prevention) and modaliti es
(e.g., website, online games). This demonstrates the divers ity of
interventions that can be made through digital technologie s to
meet diﬀerent needs. Despite this heterogeneity, the majorit y of
the interventions reported in this study are meant to reduce t he
burden of depression, the most worrying mental healthproblem
inChile( 16).
Studies have prioritized the use of digital technologies to
assist vulnerable groups in low-resource settings, especiall y in
primary care. This is especially relevant for low-resource hea lth
services located in rural hard-to-reach areas where there i s no
specializedmentalhealthcarenearby.Remotecollaborative care
andtelepsychiatryinterventionsreviewedinthisstudysho wthat
it is feasible to use technologies for collaborative care in t his
particular context, with adequate acceptability and satisfa ction
levelsamonghealthcareteamsandpatients.
The reviewed studies are addressing not only adult
populations but also children and adolescents, who are in
a critical period where many mental health disorders arise.
Implementing Internet-based interventions to prevent or trea t
mental health problems in this age group can be a reasonable
way of dealing with the severe scarcity of mental health care
resources in developing countries, considering that this age
group is familiar with digital technologies. The reviewed s tudies
show that Internet-based interventions are feasible in chi ldren
andadolescents,withadequateacceptabilitylevels.
Despite the recent growth of this ﬁeld, the number of
conducted and on-going studies is still low when compared
to developed countries. Most studies are mainly concentrated
on the feasibility and acceptability of the interventions. T he
few eﬀectiveness studies (RCTs) show that the interventions
supported by digital technologies are feasible, but failed to
demonstrate their eﬀectiveness in reducing symptomatology.
Demonstrating signiﬁcant diﬀerences between intervention s
and control conditions is hindered by low sample sizes that
lead to low statistical power. Therefore, there is a need to
develop more eﬀectiveness studies with larger sample sizes an d
substantial follow-up periods. Likewise, studies need to dev elop
understanding on how interventions work, for whom, and why
(mechanisms of change) they work. Given that one of the main
arguments for introducing Internet-based interventions i s their
Frontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 6 December 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 391Rojas et al. Improving Mental Health Through Technologies
cost-saving potential, cost-eﬀectiveness evaluations are a lso of
crucialimportancetotheﬁeld( 37).
Some of the reviewed studies reported particular concern for
the social adaptation and cultural sensitivity of intervent ions,
highlighting that the involvement of participants (patients a nd
providers) in the design of interventions could be crucial fo r
theirsuccess.Forexample,intheMascayanoetal.( 34)study,the
investigators included peer-adolescents in their research team as
“expertsbyexperience”toadvisethecreationoftheinterven tion.
Similarly,Carrasco( 31)conductedfocusgroupswithadolescents
in order to get information for the design of their video game
intervention. The Martínez et al. (under review) study also
concluded that it is necessary to involve the target users in the
designoftheinterventioninordertoencourageparticipatio n.
The studies reviewed consistently show a gap between
acceptability and usability/adherence of interventions. I n this
regard, future studies need to address challenges associat ed with
high attrition in these programs. In the CTA program, in order
to improve user retention, the authors suggested adding more
personalizedandinteractivecontent,andmoreconcretetas ksfor
users to perform during their interaction with it. Furthermo re,
in the evaluation of this program, Parada et al. ( 38) suggested
using a persuasive systems design approach. Likewise, in the
study of Espinosa et al. ( 32) participants who had completed the
intervention suggested diversifying the monitoring asses sments
and having the possibility to interact with a therapist from th e
treatment center where they underwent face-to-face treatm ent.
Both Martínez et al. (under review) and Espinosa et al. ( 32)
suggested enabling peer communication. ASCENSO and CTA
studies showed that email does not seem to be a good way
to contact and monitor participants ( 27,29). A possible way
to improve the usability and eﬀectiveness of e-mental health
interventions is to facilitate access to the content of progr ams
usingmobiledeviceslikesmartphones( 8,9).
The case of ASCENSO and CTA reveals that it is probably
relevantforparticipantstoknowthatonlinepersonalizedcon tact

withoutdisproportionatelyincreasingcostsforhealthserv ices.
A critical issue in mental health research is the gap between
what is known about interventions and what is provided
in daily care routines. To ensure the scaling-up of the
interventionsreviewed,itisnecessarytoproducemethodol ogical
developments in eﬀectiveness and cost-eﬀectiveness studies, but
also in implementation methods ( 40). Since a key strategy
for increasing the use of digital technologies in mental hea lth
programs includes the development of translation-focused
research, studies need to place greater emphasis on facilitato rs
and (structural and cultural) barriers to the implementatio n of
these technologies in the Chilean health system, especially in
primarycareservices.Most developing countries do not have suﬃcient mental
healthresourcesorhighlytrainedprofessionalsinmentalh ealth.
The accelerated growth in mobile and Internet connectivity
witnessed in the recent years have boosted the development
of the e-mental health ﬁeld in order to reduce this gap. The
lessons learned in the Chilean context can provide local
evidence for persuading policymakers and other stakeholders
to support Internet-based interventions, which is critical t o

to widely disseminate and scale up these interventions.
The Chilean case can also inspire initiatives in other
developingcountries.
CONCLUSIONS
Internet-basedinterventionsareatanearlystageofdevel opment
in Chile. There are few studies on eﬀectiveness and no studies
on cost-eﬀectiveness, which makes it diﬃcult to disseminate
and scale up these interventions. However, the growing amou nt
