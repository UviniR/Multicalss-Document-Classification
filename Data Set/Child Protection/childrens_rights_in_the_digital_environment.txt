14 October 2020, 8.30am -10.00am  NY time  
 
Online interactive panel, via zoom hosted by UNICEF  
 
Convened by The Delegation of the European Union to the United Nations, the Permanent Mission of Uruguay to the United 
Nations, and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)  
 
 
 
On 14 October 2020, the  EU Delegation to the UN and the Permanent Mission of Uruguay to the UN, in collaboration with UNICEF, 
hosted a forward -looking side event panel discussion in the margins of the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly on the 
Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Children. The panel discussion followed the 12 October Interactive Dialogue, where 
UNICEF Deputy  Executive Director Charlotte Petri Gornitzka presented the  Report on the Status of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child  and other child rights reports at the Third Committee.  
The panel focused on  children’s rights in the digital environment .  
 
This topic is particularly relevant today with the global COVID -19 pandemic that has resulted in millions of children increasingly relying 
on online tools, systems and platforms in multiple ways important to  their lives. These range from the infrastructural — facilitating 
education, healthcare, and food reaching plates — to the social – children connecting to learn, to play, and to stay in touch with their 
family and friends. This increased reliance also cont inues to expose children to the risk of violence, exploitation and abuse (including 
sexual exploitation and abuse) and has made explicit the existing ‘digital divide’ and deep -seated and systemic inequalities.  
 
This topic was  prominently reflected in the Secretary -General's report on the Rights of the Child and will be the focus  of the upcoming 
General Comment 25 of the Committee on the Rights of the Child.  
The event  was moderated by Mr. Andrew Morley, President and CEO of Worl d Vision International and attracted over 80 participants  
from Member States, Civil Society Organizations, UNICEF and other UN entities.  
 
 2 In their opening statements both the EU and Uruguay representatives noted that the biennalisation of the GA resolutio n on the 
promotion and protection of the rights of children does not mean that it should disappear from our radar screen, and that on the 
contrary it is   crucial to maintain the space for child rights, including through this type of events.  
The panelists touched on a range of opportunities and risks for child rights as induced by the digital environment.  
 
Mr. Manus de Barra, Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary -General on Violence against Children  focused his 
intervention on the protectio n of children online and the need for an inclusive and empowering digital agenda for children.  
 
Ms. Amal Aldoseri, Vice -Chair, Committee on the Rights of the Child  gave an overview of the upcoming General Comment on children’s 
rights in the digital enviro nment that the Committee on the Rights of the Child is currently preparing.  
 
Mr. Robert Jenkins, UNICEF Associate  Director, Education spoke about the opportunities to advance quality learning and education 
through the use of digital technologies and platforms but also the inherent inequalities in terms of access to tools, technologies, and 
learning support.  
 
Mr. Ahmed Mihaimeed, Project manager of Digital Village, SOS Children’s Village  International  shared the experience of Digital V illage 
which helps provide access to technology for vulnerable children and their caregivers in order to bridge the digital divide a s well as 
support to ensure that their online safety remains a priority.  
 
Mr. Kenneth Brent Villa, Trust & Safety Counsel i n Adobe, and President of the Technology  Coalition ; and Ms. Alicia Blum -Ross, Public 
Policy Lead, Kids and Families in Google, and  Research Chair of the Technology Coalition  shared their perspectives on the role of the 
private sector in regard to the promotion and protection of child rights in the digital space with a particular focus on init iatives in place 
to fight sexual exploitation and abuse online .  
 
The main takeaways of the discussion included:  
 
• We need to build a safe, secure, inclusive digital environment for all children that is also human rights compliant.  
• Internet was not created for children but has become an essential tool for their development.  
• Member States have a primary role to play in  promoting and protecting child rights online.  
 3 • The rights of the child in the digital environment are the same as in real life but to be able to guarantee them we need a de ep 
understanding of the complexities brought in by the digital world.  
• Technology and  digital tools can help children reach their potential, but safe digital spaces for children are needed. This 
requires governments, private sector, and civil society working together. Supporting children’s rights online is truly a 
partnership effort.  
• We ne ed to put the participation of children in the heart of any process that we get engaged in.  
• ‘There is no one country or stakeholder that can ensure child safety online by itself; and there is not one specific way that  we 
should follow”. It is important tho ugh that we systematically bring in a multi -stakeholder approach and use a child -rights 
framework.  
 
The discussion was followed by a rich Q and A session.

protecting children online during the covid pandemic; and the GC will bring an authoritative guidance 
on what a ri ght- based approach involves  
• Children’s views and concerns must be heard : The empowerment of children must be at the heart of 
our approach; we should provide enabling pathways for children to become agents of change in that 
context; they need access to res ources which is also the case of caregivers and parents.

Robert Jenkins,  
Associate Director 
Education, UNICEF  • Opportunities to advance learning and education through digital but also challenges that come along  
• Highlighting the potential of technology in the context of education  
• Global learning crisis prior to pandemic  (great success with increasing access to school that did not 
necessarily translate into learning outcomes that we had hoped for); Covid 19 e xacerbated the 
learning crisis, and will have potentially life long implications for children with 24 million children that 
may not be returning to school  
• But it also presents opportunities. “UNICEF believes...that we are presented with a once in a 
generat ion opportunity to leapfrog education opportunities into the future.”  
• Can seize this moment  
• Strong partnerships across world, countries and communities to address learning crisis  
• Renewed commitment to reach the most marginalized children  
• New openness of go vernments, ministries of education, partners, to reimagine education  
• We can “transform and revolutionize education” – provide a modern education  
▪ More interest -based, self -paced (meet individual needs of child, child’s context)  
▪ Shift towards more skill-focused (foundational, transferable, digital, entrepreneurial, 
job-specific)  
▪ Platform to offer a  holistic range of support, leveraging school s (education is the most 
widely spread government service reaching children)   7 • Including psycho -social, mental,  physical, nutritional needs (school meals)  
• Pandemic has impacted these services  
• Increasing inequalities and vulnerabilities, need to promote universality in future, reaching all 
children and youth  
• Employing effective and appropriate technology = key for f uture of education  
• Eliminate digital divide, connect all children  
 
Vina Barahman, 
UNICEF  (taking 
over for Rob)  • Partners are critical  to reimagine education  
• ED note: “ how important the moment is to leverage the possibilities offered to us by technology which 
can be an  incredible and historic equalizer if we get it right”

c. Monica Nascimento e Silva, Human Rights Officer (OHCHR)  
 
• Question about the work of the Technology coalition on harmful commercial marketing  
 
Response: Alicia Blum -Ross  
 
This is an aspect that the different members of the Techology Coalition work on on an individual basis and it is an important  issue to 
be tackl ed. But it is not the main focus of the Technology Colaition which is combatting sexual exploitation and abuse  online. There 
are links though in terms of tackling ‘advertising” for sexual exploitation; financial transactions occurring around sexual a buse e tc.
