Background : This study examined the cyberbullying experience and coping manners of 
adolescents in urban Vietnam and explored the mediating effect of different support to 
the associations between cyberbullying and mental health issues.
Methods : A cross-sectional study was performed on 484 students at four secondary 
schools. Cyberbullying experience, coping strategies, psychological problems, and family, 
peer, and teacher support were obtained. Structural equation modeling was utilized to 
determine the mediating effects of different support on associations between cyberbullying 
and psychological problems.
Results : There were 11.6 and 28.3% of students who reported that they experienced 
and observed at least one cyberbullying act in the last 3 months, respectively. Among the 
victims, only 48.2% tried to stop the perpetrators. Meanwhile, the majority of observers 
belonged to the “Intervene” group who tried to report cyberbullying acts or help victims. 
Family support was found to partially mediate associations between cyberbullying 
experience and observation with levels of psychological problems among adolescents.
Conclusion : The 3-month rate of cyberbullying experience and observation among urban 
adolescents aged 11–14 was low. However, current coping strategies against cyberbullying 
were not sufficient. Family support is an important factor that should be considered for 
designing interventions to mitigating the impacts of cyberbullying on the mental health 
of adolescents.

Cyberbullying has been well-documented as a global public 
health problem. Cyberbullying includes acts such as posting 
publicly available information on the Internet, being called or 
receiving messages that threaten or being harassed on the Internet, 
and others ( Patchin and Hinduja, 2006 ). Compared with traditional 
bullying, cyberbullying can occur every time and everywhere, 
and the identity of the perpetrator may not be disclosed ( Patchin 
and Hinduja, 2006 ). Therefore, cyberbullying may be  more 
frequent and have more serious consequences for the victim. 
Studies show that cyberbullying significantly affects adolescents, 
such as increasing the risk of depression, anxiety, and suicidal 
ideation ( Klomek et  al., 2010 ; Schneider et  al., 2012 ; Nixon, 
2014 ; Fahy et  al., 2016 ; Pabian and Vandebosch, 2016 ; Yuchang 
et  al., 2019 ), as well as causing physical and psychosomatic 
problems such as difficulty sleeping, headache, and loss of appetite 
(Beckman et al., 2012 ; Schneider et al., 2012 ; Schultze-Krumbholz 
et  al., 2012 ; Kowalski and Limber, 2013 ). Cyberbullying is also 
associated with the onset of substance use, traditional and 
cyberbullying perpetration, and delinquency ( Mitchell et  al., 
2007 ; Wong et  al., 2014 ; Chan and Wong, 2020 ; Estévez et  al., 
2020 ). These consequences have been observed in all perpetrators, 
victims, and observers of cyberbullying ( Beckman et  al., 2012 ; 
Wong et  al., 2014 ; Panumaporn et  al., 2020 ).
Cyberbullying among adolescents is a prevalent phenomenon 
across nations. A prior systematic review showed that 20 to 
40% of adolescents experienced cyberbullying at least once in 
their lifetime ( Aboujaoude et  al., 2015 ), and this rate tends to 
increase with increasing Internet and social media accessibility 
(Hamm et al., 2015 ). In the United States, the rate of adolescents 
who were victims of cyberbullying was from 3 to 72% ( Selkie 
et  al., 2016 ). A study conducted in seven European countries 
showed that 13.3–37.3% of adolescents aged 14–17  years were 
victims of cyberbullying ( Athanasiou et  al., 2018 ). In the Asian 
region, a review in Chinese populations revealed different 
prevalence of cyberbullying victimization in adolescents, ranging 
at 14–57% in mainland China, 13–35% in Taiwan, and 12–72% 
in Hong Kong ( Chan and Wong, 2015 ). In Korea, 14.6% adolescents 
were cyberbullying victims ( Lee and Shin, 2017 ). Coping strategies 
when having cyberbullying experience may vary and can 
be  classified into four groups: (1) directly reacting against 
cyberbullying acts (such as retaliation or constructive feedback); 
(2) ignoring the cyberbullying behaviors (such as avoidance or 
doing nothing), (3) seeking support from other sources (such 
as parents, friends, or teachers), and (4) utilizing technological 
solutions (such as blocking senders; Perren et al., 2012 ). A study 
in Hong Kong indicated that older male adolescents were more 
likely to have an active approach to cope with cyberbullying 
such as informing to adults, parents, or teachers; while adolescents, 
having limited experience with their schools, tended to have 
avoid (e.g., ignore the cyberbullying behaviors) approaches ( Chan 
and Wong, 2017 ). Another study in Czech adolescents found 
that technological strategies were the most common, following 
by avoidance and finding support ( Machackova et  al., 2013 ).
The proliferation of cyberbullying requires accelerating efforts 
to explore approaches to prevent and mitigate its consequences. Global studies showed that social support is an essential component 
in protecting adolescents from the consequences of traditional 
bullying ( Kochenderfer-Ladd and Skinner, 2002 ; Davidson and 
Demaray, 2007 ; Rothon et  al., 2011 ). Social support refers to 
instrumental support (such as providing the victim with helpful 
solutions or resources) or emotional support (such as spiritual 
encouragement, belongingness, or value recognition; House et al., 
1988 ; Kerres Malecki and Kilpatrick Demaray, 2002 ). In literature, 
many studies have shown that family and friends support can 
play an important role in protecting adolescents from becoming 
victims of cyberbullying ( Price and Dalgleish, 2010 ; Fanti et  al., 
2012 ; Hellfeldt et  al., 2019 ). In addition, adolescents who are 
of school age can get help from teachers. Previous research has 
shown that victims and perpetrators of cyber-violence possibly 
knew each other at school, and parents, friends, and teachers 
are important sources of information and support for teens 
dealing with cyberbullying ( Slonje and Smith, 2008 ).
Although many studies showed that social support helps 
to prevent cyberbullying among adolescents, its effectiveness 
in minimizing the psychological consequences of cyberbullying 
among victims or observers has been in debate. An earlier 
study found that support from friends alone was effective in 
reducing psychological problems among victims of cyberbullying 
(Holt and Espelage, 2007 ). Another research found that both 
support from family and friends played an important role in 
preventing victims from the mental consequences of cyberbullying 
(Rothon et al., 2011 ). These results concluded that social support 
held the potential for minimizing the cyberbullying-related 
psychological problems in youths. However, the evidence for 
this effect in different population groups (such as victims, 
perpetrators, or observers) is limited.
In Vietnam, evidence about cyberbullying among adolescents 
as well as the impact of social support on cyberbullying is 
currently limited. Only one previous study was conducted on 
215 adolescents and youths aged 13–18  in Hanoi, Vietnam, to 
measure the cyberbullying experience in these groups ( Chi et al., 
2020 ). By using the modified Patchin and Hinduja’s scale, this 
study found that 45.1% of sample had experienced cyberbullying 
at least once, with being called by names as the most typical 
form ( Chi et  al., 2020 ). The common responses to cyberbullies 
included ignoring cyberbullying behaviors and not telling family 
or teacher ( Chi et  al., 2020 ). To date, none of the studies were 
conducted about the mediation effect of social support on mental 
disorders in adolescents who were victims or observers of 
cyberbullying. Therefore, our study was conducted to examine 
the experience of adolescents aged 11–14  in urban Vietnam, 
determine how they coped with this issue, and explore the 
preventive mediation effect of social support to the associations 
between cyberbullying and mental health issues.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Theoretical Framework
In this study, we  employed stress buffering hypothesis  
(Cohen and Wills, 1985 ), which perceived social support that could  
mediate the relationship between stressors (i.e., cyberbullying in  Ngo et al. Cyberbullying in AdolescentsFrontiers in Psychology  | www.frontiersin.org  3 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 661919this case) and their negative consequences (i.e., mental 
problems). In other words, a higher level of social support 
could more weaken this relationship. Cohen and Wills in 
their study suggested that social support could diminish 
people’s perceptions about the threat of given stressors, or 
offer coping options or other necessary resources to individuals 
against the stressors ( Cohen and Wills, 1985 ). Via literature 
review, we  hypothesized that support from family, peers, 
and teachers might play a buffering role in mediating the 
effect of cyberbullying experience on the mental health of 
adolescents ( Holt and Espelage, 2007 ; Rothon et  al., 2011 ). 
Therefore, we  examined the direct effect of cyberbullying 
experience on adolescents’ mental health, as well as the 
indirect effect of social support in buffering relationships 
between cyberbullying and mental health.
Study Design
Data of this paper were collected through a cross-sectional study 
conducted in Hanoi, Vietnam, from January to September 2020. 
Four secondary schools were randomly selected in this study 
from a list of secondary schools in Hanoi. The school principal 
and teachers were approached by the research team and informed 
of the research content. The questionnaire used in this study was 
submitted to them for approval before implementing data collection.
Participants included students aged 11–14  years, attending 
four selected secondary schools; and they, as well as their 
parents and teachers, agreed to be  enrolled in the study. This 
study used a formula to estimate a population proportion with 
specified relative precision to calculate the essential sample, 
with p = 0.45 (according to previous research in Hanoi, Vietnam; 
Chi et  al., 2020 ); confidence level α  =  0.05; relative precision 
ɛ  =  0.2. The sample size needed for a school was 118 students 
or 472 students/4 schools. An additional 10% sample size was 
added to prevent participants from dropout or nonresponse, 
resulting in 520 students (or 130 students per school) being 
invited to respond to questions about cyberbullying.
A multi-stage sampling method was applied. First, the 
research team randomly selected two classes in each grade of 
each school, resulting in 32 classes being selected for the 
sample. Next, in these 32 classes, 520 students were randomly 
selected to participate in the cyberbullying survey. There were 
36 students who did not agree to participate, leading to a 
total of 484 students (response rate of 93.1%). These students, 
along with their parents or guardians, were provided written 
informed consent with brief information about research 
objectives, eligible criteria, research process, and benefits and 
requirements during study participation. This research protocol 
has been approved by the institutional review board of Hanoi 
Medical University (Code 22NCS17/HDDDDHYHN).
Data Collection and Measurement
Students participating in this study were asked to complete 
an anonymous survey questionnaire. The research team 
directly distributed the questionnaires to students. During 
the survey, parents, teachers, and unselected students did 
not present at the site of the survey to avoid their influence on the participants’ responses. Each student spent 15–20 min 
completing the questionnaire. A structured questionnaire 
was used for this study. The content of the questionnaire 
was developed under the guidance of child violence experts. 
The questionnaires were pretested on 10 adolescents to 
ensure understandability, expression, and logic, which aimed 
to avoid misunderstanding or confusion to study participants.
Variables
Cyberbullying Experience/Bystander and Coping 
Strategies
In this study, we  used the Cyberbullying Test instrument to 
identify the individual’s experience and observation of 
cyberbullying ( Garaigordobil, 2017 ). Originally, this tool asked 
participants to answer 45 items about 15 cyberbullying acts in 
three roles (15 items per role): perpetrators, victims, and observers. 
Examples of items in the instrument included the following: 
“Have they ever sent you  offensive and insulting messages by 
cellphone or Internet?” “Have you  ever received offensive and 
insulting calls on your cellphone or by Internet (Skype …)?” 
“Have you  ever been assaulted to tape the assault and hang it 
on the Internet?” Each question had four options about from 
0 “never” to 3 “always. ” In this study, we  used only two parts 
of the instrument: for victims and observers (or bystanders). 
Moreover, in the pilot, we  observed that it was difficult for our 
participants (i.e., secondary school students) to respond to the 
questions with these four options. Thus, we decided to ask them 
a series of yes/no questions to determine whether they experienced 
cyberbullying acts as victims and observers in the last 3 months. 
This recall duration was applied to minimize the potential recall 
bias. Participants were categorized into “Cyberbullying experience” 
or “Cyberbullying observation” if they reported “yes” for at least 
one cyberbullying act. The Cronbach alpha values of “Cyberbullying 
experience” and “Cyberbullying observation” items were 0.8830 
and 0.8993, respectively.
In this study, for people experiencing cyberbullying, we asked 
them to recall the impacts of these cyberbullying acts, coping 
strategies against cyberbullying, supporters when facing 
cyberbullying, and reasons for not reporting cyberbullying 
experience. Meanwhile, for those ever observing cyberbullying 
acts, participants were asked to report their reactions toward 
these behaviors. These reactions were classified into three groups: 
“Intervene, ” “Ignore, ” and “Join in. ”
- “Intervene” included (1) “oppose acts of cyberbullying, ” (2) 
“try to help or comfort the victim, ” and (3) “report online 
violence to people able to help the victim (e.g., teachers 
and parents). ”
- “Ignore” included “leaving cyberspace. ”
- “Join in” included “Encouraging cyberbullying behaviors” and 
“Enjoys cyberbullying acts, and wants to learn more, but 
does not participate or promote publicly. ”
In addition, we  asked them to explain the reasons if they 
did not report the observed cyberbullying acts. We  also asked 
all participants to express their attitude toward cyberbullying 
by asking them a question: “What extend do you  agree or Ngo et al. Cyberbullying in AdolescentsFrontiers in Psychology  | www.frontiersin.org  4 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 661919disagree with cyberbullying?” The students rated their attitude 
with an 11-point Likert scale from 0 “Totally agree” to 10 
“Total disagree. ”
Psychological Problems
To evaluate the psychological problems, the Depression, Anxiety, 
and Stress Scale—21 Items (DASS-21) was utilized. This 
instrument included 21 items regarding depression (seven items, 
range score 0–21), anxiety (seven items, range score 0–21), 
and stress symptoms (seven items, range score 0–21) in the 
last 7 days ( Le et al., 2017 ). Examples of items in the instrument 
included the following: “I found it hard to wind down” (stress 
domain), “I was aware of dryness of my mouth” (anxiety 
domain), and “I could not seem to experience any positive 
feeling at all” (depression domain; Lovibond and Lovibond, 
1996 ). Participants responded to each item on a four-point 
Likert scale from 0 “Did not apply to me at all” to 3 “ Applied 
to me very much or most of the time” ( Le et  al., 2017 ). A 
higher score in each part indicated a higher severity of this 
psychological problem. The Vietnamese version of this instrument 
had been validated elsewhere ( Le et  al., 2017 ). The Cronbach 
alpha of this instrument was 0.8523.
Social Support
Support from family (two items), peer (two items), and teacher 
(three items) was measured by using seven items, as below:
 1. My parents do not understand me or care about my feelings.
 2. My parents do not listen to me or do not pay attention 
to the problems I  have.
 3. My classmates are very friendly.
 4. My classmates respect me and listen to my opinion.
 5. My teachers help me when I’m sad or having problems.
 6. My teachers take care of me and support me in achieving 
the best results.
 7. My teachers respect me and listen to me.
Students rated each item on a five-point Likert scale from 
1 “Totally disagree” to 5 “Totally agree. ” The score of each 
domain was computed by dividing the total scores of items 
in this domain by the number of items. Scores of questions 
1 and 2 were reversed before computing the score of parental 
support. The score of each domain was from 1 to 5, with a 
greater score meaning a higher level of support. The Cronbach 
alpha of this instrument was 0.8205.
Sociodemographic Characteristics
In this part, we collected data about age, gender (male/female), 
and type of family (nuclear/multi-generations/others).
Statistical Analysis
A p-value of <0.05 was used to detect a statistical significance. 
Stata 16.0 software was used for analyzing data. A listwise 
deletion approach was applied to handle missing data. 
Descriptive statistics were performed for all variables of interest. 
Statistical tests including chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests were used to examine the difference between sociodemographic 
characteristics, social support, cyberbullying attitude, and 
psychological problems between cyberbullying experience/
non-experience and cyberbullying observation/non-observation. 
Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify 
the factors associated with cyberbullying experience (yes = 1/
no  =  0, model 1) and cyberbullying observation (yes  =  1/
no  =  0, model 2). Independent variables included 
sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, and types of 
the family), support from family/peer/teachers, cyberbullying 
attitude, cyberbullying experience (for model 2), and 
cyberbullying observation (for model 1). Moreover, among 
those ever observing cyberbullying acts in the last 3  months 
(n  =  136), we  performed the multivariate logistic regression 
models to determine factors that were related to “Intervene” 
(yes  =  1/no  =  0, model 3) or “Ignore” (yes  =  1/no  =  0, 
model 4) behaviors. Independent variables for models 3 and 
4 included sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, and 
types of the family), support from family/peer/teachers, 
cyberbullying attitude, and cyberbullying experience. We  did 
not perform the regression analysis for the “Join in” outcome 
because only nine students had these behaviors, which might 
not be  a large enough sample size for the analysis.
Finally, structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to 
examine the mediation effects of family, peer, and teacher 
support on the relationships between cyberbullying experience/
observation and psychological problems. The roles of 
cyberbullying (cyberbullying experience and observation) were 
coded as binary variables (yes = 1, no = 0), while the depression, 
anxiety, and stress variables were treated as continuous variables. 
The mean- and variance-adjusted maximum likelihood test 
statistic (MLMV) was performed for the SEM, given its robustness 
for data with non-normal distribution ( Maydeu-Olivares, 2017 ). 
Multiple goodness-of-fit indices, including the root-mean-square 
error of approximation (RMSEA), the comparative fit index 
(CFI), and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) 
were examined. RMSEA lower than 0.08, SRMR lower than 
0.08, and CFI higher than 0.09 were considered acceptable 
model fits ( Kline, 2015 ).
Ethical Approval
Given highly sensitive information collected from adolescents, 
we  performed the following actions to ensure the rights and 
benefits of participants. First, we  provided an information 
package to students and their parents/guardians before the 
survey implementation. This package had detailed information 
about the purposes of the study, study designs, eligible criteria, 
rights, and benefits of study participants. It was also emphasized 
in the information package that the participation of students 
was voluntary and that relationships between the students and 
teachers/schools would not be  affected in any way if they did 
not participate in the survey. No individual data were collected 
to protect students’ privacy; thus, it was impossible to re-identify 
the participants based on the current dataset. Students and 
their caregivers were also informed that they could skip any 
questions that they felt uncomfortable or they could withdraw 
from the study at any time. We  offered the helpline in the Ngo et al. Cyberbullying in AdolescentsFrontiers in Psychology  | www.frontiersin.org  5 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 661919information package for students who needed help to address 
cyberbullying-related issues. Contacts of the principal 
investigators and coordinators of this study were provided to 
answer all questions raised about the study.
RESULTS
The characteristics of participants are presented in Table  1 . 
Among 484 secondary school students, the mean age was 
12.6 ( SD  =  1.2) years. There were 11.6 and 28.3% of students 
reporting that they experienced and observed at least one 
cyberbullying act in the last 3  months, respectively. No 
difference was observed regarding gender, age, and type of 
family between those with and without cyberbullying experience 
(p > 0.05). Meanwhile, the rate of females in the cyberbullying 
observation group (68.6%) was significantly higher than that 
in the non-cyberbullying observation (56.2%). A significant 
age difference was also found between these two groups 
(p  <  0.001).
Table  1  also reveals that people who experienced 
cyberbullying showed significantly lower levels of attitude 
against cyberbullying ( p = 0.022) and lower levels of perceived 
family ( p  <  0.001) and teachers support ( p  =  0.007), but a 
higher level of perceived peer support ( p = 0.005) and higher depression ( p  <  0.001), anxiety ( p  <  0.001), and stress scores 
(p  <  0.001) than did those not experiencing cyberbullying. 
These differences were also observed between participants 
with and without cyberbullying observation ( p < 0.05), except 
for the level of cyberbullying attitude.
Figure  1  illustrates the 3-month rate of each cyberbullying 
behavior in terms of experience and observation. “Stole password 
to prevent access to blog/email” was the most common behavior 
when 6.6 and 18.4% of participants ever experienced and 
observed this behavior, respectively. “Received offensive & 
insulting messages on cellphone/by Internet” and “Slandered 
through the Internet, telling lies or spread rumors” were the 
second and third most common acts.
Among participants experiencing cyberbullying as victims, 
Table  2  indicates that 26.8% of students felt anxiety and fear 
and did not want to be  close to anyone. Over 21% of victims 
had reduced study performance, 12.5% had suicidal ideation, 
and even 10.7% had suicidal attempts. However, only 48.2% 
tried to stop the perpetrators, and 35.7% told this experience 
to their friends. None of them told teachers, parents, or relatives. 
“Try to cope by myself, ” “I think my parents, teachers or 
adults do not understand or believe me, ” and “I think there’s 
nothing my parents, teachers or adults can do to help me” 
were the three most common reasons for not reporting 
cyberbullying acts among victims.

grouped into the “Intervene” category; 56 students (40.9%) 
and nine students (6.6%) were classified into “Ignore” and 
“Join in” categories, respectively (one student could do more 
than one act toward cyberbullying observation). Being afraid 
of having limited use of the Internet if they reported cyberbullying 
behaviors, thinking that adults did not understand or believe, 
and thinking that adults could not do anything for victims 
were the three most popular reasons for not reporting the 
cyberbullying behaviors among observers ( Table  3 ).
Table  4  shows associated factors with cyberbullying 
experience and observation. Cyberbullying experience was 
only found to be  associated with cyberbullying observation 
(OR  =  5.86, 95% CI  =  3.06–11.21). Meanwhile, being female 
and of higher age were positively related to cyberbullying 
observation, whereas having a higher level of support from 
family (OR  =  0.76, 95% CI  =  0.61–0.94) was negatively 
associated with the cyberbullying observation.
In regression analysis, only cyberbullying attitude was found 
to be  associated with “intervene” behaviors (OR  =  1.53, 95% 
CI  =  1.10–2.12). Participants having a higher level of peer 
support were more likely to ignore the cyberbullying acts 
(OR  =  1.78, 95% CI  =  1.08–2.93), while those having a higher 
level of teacher support were less likely to ignore these acts 
(OR  =  0.64, 95% CI  =  0.42–0.98; Table  5 ).
The SEM is illustrated in Figure  2 . The goodness-of-fit 
indices were acceptable with RMSEA  =  0.052, CFI  =  0.983, 
and SRMR  =  0.026. The model shows that only cyberbullying 
experience showed a significantly positive direct effect on 
psychological problems. The cyberbullying experience group 
was significantly related to family and peer support, while the 
cyberbullying observation group was only significantly associated with family support. Only family support showed to be negatively 
associated with psychological problems, whereas peer and teacher 
support showed positive relations with psychological problems.
Table  6  determines the mediation or indirect effects of 
different types of support. For both cyberbullying experience 
and observation, only family support was found to partially 
mediate associations between cyberbullying experience and 
observation with levels of psychological problems among our 
participants. Regarding cyberbullying experience, the indirect 
effect of family support accounted for 18.3% of the total effect 
and 22.4% of the direct effect. Meanwhile, regarding cyberbullying 
observation, this indirect effect accounted for 32.5% of the 
total effect and 48.1% of the direct effect.
DISCUSSION
Our study contributed to the current literature about the 
experience and coping strategies of adolescents toward 
cyberbullying and the potential effects of different support to 
mitigate the psychological consequence of cyberbullying. Our 
study suggested a low rate of cyberbullying experience and 
observation in secondary school students, as well as a high 
risk of psychological problems among those experiencing 
cyberbullying. Moreover, family support was an important 
protective source and helped mediate the relationship between 
cyberbullying and psychological problems.
The rate of adolescents involving in cyberbullying as victims 
over the past 3  months in our study was low, according to 
the self-report information from the participants. This rate 
was much lower than previous research in Hanoi, Vietnam, 
which showed that 45.1% of adolescents aged 13–18 were 
FIGURE 1 |  The 3-month rates of different cyberbullying behaviors in the study population ( n = 484).Ngo et al. Cyberbullying in AdolescentsFrontiers in Psychology  | www.frontiersin.org  7 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 661919victims of cyberbullying in the past 12 months ( Chi et al., 2020 ). 
Our result was equivalent to a previous study in the United States 
with 11% of adolescents who studied grades 6 to 8 being 
bullied online in the past 2  months ( Kowalski and Limber, 
2007 ). Overall, the estimated prevalence of cyberbullying varied 
significantly between different studies and countries due to 
the difference of cyberbullying definition, time frame, and 
methods of measurement ( Berne et  al., 2013 ; Selkie et  al., 
2016 ; Brochado et  al., 2017 ), which results in the problematic 
study comparisons. Indeed, using the Cyberbullying Test, which 
was a valid scale to measure cyberbullying ( Garaigordobil, 
2017 ), was advantageous to our study compared with other 
prior research. This measure contains 15 cyberbullying behaviors, 
enabling us to capture more comprehensive aspects that 
participants might suffer or observe during the recall period 
than other previous studies ( Hellfeldt et  al., 2019 ; Livazović 
and Ham, 2019 ; Chi et  al., 2020 ; Panumaporn et  al., 2020 ).
Notably, our results showed that though the impact of 
cyberbullying was significant, the proportion of participants 
taking specific actions against cyberbullying was not high. In 
addition to the impact on academic performance, there was 
a high proportion of individuals who experienced cyberbullying suffering the negative psychological effects such as anxiety, 
fear, and even suicidal thoughts. This was similar to previous 
studies showing the serious consequences of cyberbullying on 
the lives of victims ( Schneider et  al., 2012 ; Nixon, 2014 ). 
Nonetheless, the findings showed that only nearly 50% of the 
victims tried to stop this act of the perpetration, and 33.9% TABLE 2 |  Impacts, reactions, supporters, and reasons for not reporting

shared with friends about the issue of cyberbullying but did 
not share it with parents or teachers. The most common reasons 
for not sharing with parents or teachers were because the 
adolescents were afraid that the adults did not believe or the 
adults will not be  able to do anything for the adolescents. 
Another reason was that the victims wanted to solve this 
problem themselves. In a previous study in Vietnam, it was 
found that ignoring this behavior and blocking the perpetrator’s 
account were the two most common measures (58.8 and 54.6%, 
respectively; Chi et  al., 2020 ). However, problems caused by 
cyberbullying were not easy to deal with because these behaviors 
can occur at any time and can reach large numbers of audiences in  a short period of time ( Patchin and Hinduja, 2006 ), causing 
a feeling of stigma and isolation among victims ( Bossler et  al., 
2012 ; Burton et  al., 2013 ) and, in turn, worsening the 
consequences of cyberbullying. Therefore, equipping adolescents 
with appropriate coping strategies against cyberbullying is 
essential and should be  prioritized in school and family.
Our study also examined the rate of cyberbullying observers 
among adolescents and identified how they reacted to 
cyberbullying behaviors. As expected, we found that the majority 
of observers were in the group “Intervene” who responded to 
the cyberbullying acts by reporting these behaviors or helping 
victims. This result was similar to the study in Thailand showing 
that most observers belonged to the “Intervene” group 
(Panumaporn et  al., 2020 ). However, our study was different 
from study results in Belgium, where the authors show that 
most adolescents belonged to the “Ignore” group when observing 
cyberbullying behaviors ( Van Cleemput et al., 2014 ). We assumed 
that the cultural factors might be attributable to this difference. 
While the Western culture highlighted individualism, the Asian 
culture emphasized the role of collectivism, which might motivate 
them to help others when they faced problems ( Sittichai and 
Smith, 2015 ). On the other hand, similar to the victim group, 
the main reasons that participants in the observer group did 
not report violent cyber behavior included (1) being afraid of 
limited Internet use and (2) believing that adults were unable 
to address this issue. This result suggested a huge gap in the 
relationships between parent-teacher and adolescents, especially 
among cyberbullying victims or observers. Interestingly, results 
of the multivariate models indicated an opposite trend between 
peer and teacher support, when higher peer and teacher support 
were associated with higher and lower likelihoods of being 
“Ignore” people. This phenomenon could be  justified that 
adolescents’ peers might not perceive this issue as a problem 
as adults did (i.e., parents and teachers; Slonje and Smith, 2008 ). TABLE 5 |  Associated factors with different types of cyberbullying observation.

they could not provide adequate support due to the lack of 
knowledge and resource needed. Therefore, instead of 
recommending interventions on the issue, they were more likely 
to advise to ignore cyberbullying behaviors. It should be  noted 
that the attitude against cyberbullying played an important role 
among adolescents in the “Intervene” group. This finding was 
consistent with previous studies on both cyberbullying and 
traditional bullying ( Y ang and Kim, 2017 ; Panumaporn et  al., 
2020 ). Therefore, campaigns to motivate adolescents to intervene 
in cyberbullying are critical to diminish this behavior and 
its impacts.
The findings of this study echoed previous evidence showing 
that cyberbullying experience was associated with psychological 
problems ( Beckman et  al., 2012 ; Schneider et  al., 2012 ; Nixon, 
2014 ; Wong et  al., 2014 ; Panumaporn et  al., 2020 ). Moreover, 
our study underlined the protective mediation effects of family 
support on the association between cyberbullying experience 
and observation with psychological issues. Unlike traditional 
bullying where parent, friend, and teacher support helped to 
mitigate the impact of bullying acts on victims’ lives and mental 
health ( Price and Dalgleish, 2010 ; Fanti et  al., 2012 ; Hellfeldt 
et  al., 2019 ), in our study, friend and teacher support did not 
buffer against the psychological problems among cyberbullying 
victims and/or observers. In literature, adolescents are concerned 
that sharing their experience with the teacher was an ineffective 
strategy ( Price and Dalgleish, 2010 ), and reporting the problem 
to their parents could hinder their freedom in Internet use (Hoff Dianne and Mitchell Sidney, 2009 ). However, in a previous 
survey in Sweden, parent and teacher support was found to 
buffer against depressive and anxiety symptoms in cyberbullying 
victims and bully victims ( Hellfeldt et  al., 2019 ). Another 
longitudinal study found that adolescents who were victims 
of cyberbullying had lower levels of depressive symptoms if 
they had family support ( Machmutow et al., 2012 ). As discussed 
above, we believed that parents could offer appropriate emotional 
support to help adolescents in controlling the psychological 
distress caused by cyberbullying behaviors ( Livazović and Ham, 
2019 ). Moreover, they may be more likely to perceive accurately 
the problem of cyberbullying, while friends might not fully 
recognize the trouble of cyberbullying involvement, resulting 
in the provision of inadequate support ( Slonje and Smith, 
2008 ). This result is critical since most of the victims in our 
study sought help from friends rather than their parents. Thus, 
parents should be  proactive in building a strong bond with 
their children ( Nixon, 2014 ; Slonje et  al., 2017 ). On the other 
hand, our finding partially affirmed that peer support might 
not be  the best focus to address cyberbullying and its 
consequence ( Hellfeldt et  al., 2019 ). However, further 
longitudinal studies should be  performed to test the effect of 
peer support on buffering the relationship between cyberbullying 
and psychological impairment in different contexts.
The current study indicated several implications. First, 
educational campaigns should be performed to raise adolescents, 
parents, and teachers’ awareness and attitude toward 
cyberbullying, motivating them to become involved to intervene 
and prevent cyberbullying behaviors. The contents of these 
interventions should include knowledge and practices on 
cyberbullying, communication and Internet use skills, and 
prosocial behaviors, empathy, and coping strategies with 
cyberbullying ( Hutson et  al., 2018 ). Regular training sessions 
should be  performed to help adolescents in acquiring skills 
and abilities to actively cope with cyberbullying, help other 
victims, and prevent them from joining in cyberbullying. 
Previous studies found that active strategies to cope with 
cyberbullying victimization were effective to address the 
cyberbullying-related issues ( Ybarra et  al., 2007 ; Riebel et  al., 
2009 ; Chan and Wong, 2017 ). Second, according to the study, 
leaders in schools and communities should implement activities 
that increase parents’ roles in addressing cyberbullying and 
its consequences among adolescents. Positive parent-children 
relationships could encourage adolescents to find support when 
dealing with difficult situations ( Chan and Chui, 2015 ; Chan 
and Wong, 2017 ). Finally, given that cyberbullying is an emerging 
problem but school regulations for this issue do not exist in 
Vietnam, current policies should consider this type of bullying 
and its impact, especially among adolescents.
Interpretation of the study results should be done cautiously 
with the following limitations. First, given that cyberbullying 
is a sensitive issue, relying on only self-reports from participants 
may underestimate the actual rates of cyberbullying in 
adolescents. In literature, approaches that used information 
from multiple sources such as peers and teachers would 
be  recommended ( Brochado et  al., 2017 ). Further studies 
that involve multiple reporters to measure the prevalence of TABLE 6 |  Standardized indirect effects of cyberbullying experience and

the cross-sectional design, which limited our ability to establish 
the causal associations. Thus, conclusions about the associations 
and effects in this study cannot be  definitely drawn. Future 
studies should use longitudinal designs to investigate the 
influence of cyberbullying and social support on psychological 
well-being in middle school adolescents. Third, the rate of 
cyberbullying experience and observation was low, resulting 
in a small sample size for statistical tests. Moreover, we  used 
a modified instrument to measure cyberbullying experience 
rather than use the original one, which might underestimate 
or overestimate the rate of cyberbullying victimization and 
observation. Finally, other characteristics such as traditional 
bullying exposure, the Internet or social media use, and 
cyberbullying perpetration were not fully investigated. These 
factors were found to be  associated with cyberbullying 
victimization in previous work ( Beckman et  al., 2012 ; 
Athanasiou et  al., 2018 ; Chi et  al., 2020 ). Hence, further 
studies should be  elucidated to measure these relationships 
between these factors and cyberbullying experience.
CONCLUSION
Our study suggested that the 3-month rate of cyberbullying 
experience and observation among urban adolescents aged 
11–14  in Vietnam was low. However, current coping strategies 
against cyberbullying in this group were not sufficient. Family 
support is an important factor that should be  considered for 
designing interventions to mitigate the impacts of cyberbullying 
on the mental health of adolescents.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT
