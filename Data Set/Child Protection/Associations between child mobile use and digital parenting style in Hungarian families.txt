ABSTRACT
Mobile touch screen device (MTSDs) use is becoming widespread in
children and has negative and positive consequences. Yet, factors
associated with greater use remain unexplored, despite the impor-
tance of their identi ﬁcation for intervention purposes. It stands to
reason that parents can in ﬂuence child MTSD use, via their attitudes,
beliefs, role-modelling, and style of parenting. Here, we examined the
associations between these parental characteristics and child MTSD
use and whether parenting styles speci ﬁcally with regard to child
MTSD use exist. Hungarian parents ( N= 1283) were surveyed about
their children ’s digital activities, their own attitudes and beliefs regard-
ing the child ’s MTSD use, and their own attachment to- and use of
mobile phones. Taking a data-driven approach, distinct “digital par-
enting styles ”were identi ﬁed and these resembled general parenting
styles. Findings further suggeste d that children spent more time with
MTSD use if their parents: were more permissive, more authoritative
and less authoritarian; had a lower educational level; exhibited greater
attachment to their mobile phones; and had more positive attitudes
towards, and attributed less harm and more bene ﬁts to, early device
use. These results are the ﬁrst evidence for existence of digital parent-
ing styles and suggest that parental characteristics are potential pre-
vention and treatment targets.ARTICLE HISTORY

1. Introduction
Mobile touch screen device (MTSD) use is becoming increasingly widespread among
children (Common Sense Inc., 2017 ). Children can use touchscreen devices, even before
they develop advanced motor skills, as they do not need to use controllers as they do with
personal computers or videogames. Consequently, children can begin MTSD use at an
increasingly early age. According to a US survey, the average daily time children spend with
mobile device use is almost an hour for 2 –4-year-olds and 7 minutes for children under the
age of 2 (Common Sense Inc., 2017 ). Comparable trends are apparent in Hungary (Pintér,
2016 ; where access to internet and use of digital technologies is comparable to the
European average; Hungarian Central Statistical O ﬃce,2017 ). Yet, relatively little research

TV) has (mainly negative) e ﬀects on child development (Chonchaiya & Pruksananonda,
2008 ; Zimmerman & Christakis, 2005 ). Arguably, early MTSD use (i.e., in infancy, toddlerhood
and preschool years) is likely similarly important from a developmental perspective, with
potentially both negative and positive e ﬀects (e.g., Bedford, Saez de Urabain, Celeste,
Karmilo ﬀ-Smith, & Smith, 2016 ; Li, Subrahmanyam, Bai, Xie, & Liu, 2018 ). As such, better
understanding of the characteristics and factors that are associated with earlier or more
intensive use may have implications for psychoeducation as well as prevention and inter-
vention e ﬀorts.
1.1. Direct and indirect links between parenting and child behavior
Children ’s behavior, development, and sociali zation are supposed to be directly in ﬂuenced by
their microsystem (i.e., family, p eers, and school; Bronfenbrenner, 1979 ). Especially during
early developmental stages (e.g., prior to start ing school), the family, and in particular the
parents have perhaps the greatest in ﬂuence on child behavior, relative to later developmental
stages (e.g., adolescence) which are characterized by increased peer in ﬂu e n c e( L a i b l e ,C a r l o ,&
Raﬀaelli, 2000 ). It has been hypothesized that parents directly in ﬂuence child behavior via rule
setting (Steinberg & Darling, 2017 ) and also indirectly via various other means. For example,
parents play a large role in creating a home environment and di ﬀerent aspects of that
environment promote certain behaviors and not others (e.g., whether or not there is a TV
or a PC at home, if there is one in the child ’s bedroom). Parental attitudes and behaviors
(including role-modelling) are also related to c hild habits and lifestyle, such as with regard to
amount of physical activity (Arredondo et al., 2006 ) or sedentary behavior, including as a result
of screen time (Xu, Wen, & Rissel, 2015 ). Beyond shaping and reinforcing speci ﬁc behaviors,
parenting also involves creation of a socioemotional environment through speci ﬁcparenting
styles that may a ﬀect child behavior (Rhee, 2008 ).
1.1.1. Parenting styles in the context of MTSD use
Parenting styles are strongly related to child development and outcomes (e.g., Kordi &
Baharudin, 2010 ). Parenting styles correspond to the emotional climate in which parents
raise their children (Steinberg & Darling, 2017 ) and can be characterized by dimensions of
responsiveness/warmth (responding to the child ’s needs in a supportive, accepting, nurtur-
ing and involved manner) and demandingness/control (setting demands, rules, control,
expectations, boundaries to integrate the child into the society; Baumrind, 1991 ; Spera,
2005 ). Four parenting styles can be formulated along these dimensions: authoritative (high
warmth, high demand), permissive (high warmth, low demand), laissez-faire (low warmth,
low demand) and authoritarian (low warmth, high demand).
Authoritative parenting involves high warmth, sensitivity, responsiveness and involve-
ment, as well as high expectations and high demands for maturity and self-control from
the child. Authoritative parents respect the child ’s opinion, but also maintain clear
boundaries. They foster their demands through bidirectional communication (e.g., expla-
nations of rules) and encouragement of independence.
Permissive parenting corresponds with high warmth but low demand. They set few
rules or boundaries and do not have high expectation for maturity. They refrain from
confrontations with their children, and rarely give guidance.92 V. KONOK ET AL.Parents with a laissez-faire parenting style show low warmth, responsiveness and
emotional involvement. and also have low demands. They do not set rules, do not provide
guidance and discipline. They make no demands for maturity, and impose few controls on
their child ’s behavior.
Authoritarian parents are not warm and responsive. They have high maturity demands,
are strict, expect obedience, and assert power. They express their expectations through
orders and do not explain to their children the rationale behind these rules.
Speciﬁc parenting styles in relation to certain areas or domains of parenting may exist
and these may not necessarily be the same across domains or even as general parenting
styles, they may nevertheless a ﬀect children ’s behavior or functioning in that domain (e.g.,
eating behavior; Vereecken, Legtest, De Bourdeaudhuij, & Maes, 2009 ). With regard to
media-related behaviors, parenting styles may also be expressed through levels of warmth
and demandingness. Parental responsiveness/warmth may manifest in parents supporting
their child ’s desired digital activity, e.g., letting the child watch videos or play games, helping
the child engage in certain activities (e.g., launching an application) or teaching the child
how to engage in such activities on their own. Parental demandingness, on the other hand,
may manifest in parents controlling and setting limits over the child ’s digital activities or in
supervising such activity. Indeed, parenting styles related to children ’s internet use were
found to statistically predict that use in school-aged children (Valcke, Bonte, De Wever, &
Rots, 2010 ). Children whose parents had a permissive Internet parenting style used the
internet the most and those whose parents adopted an authoritarian or authoritative
Internet parenting style used it the least. Similarly, stricter parental rules regarding TV
watching were found to be negatively associated with children ’ss c r e e nt i m e( C i l l e r o&
Jago, 2010 ). Neither the presence/nature of parenting styles related to children ’sM T S Du s e
(digital parenting styles) nor the associations of those with children ’s actual use have been
investigated to date. Identifying and better understanding these are timely, given the ever-
growing presence of digital media in the daily lives of families and society and thus its
potential to impact child development.
Digital parenting styles may not only in ﬂuence the time children spend with MTSDs, but
also the way they use it. For example, parents who expect maturity from the child or who are
involved in their child ’s MTSD use may teach the child how to use the MTSD in a functional
way. Alternatively, children whose parents onl y give them the device as a form of engagement
o rw h or e s t r i c tt h eu s em a yu s et h eM T S Df o rs i m pler activities or in a non-functional way.
The importance of parents for children ’s media use has been addressed in several
studies on parental mediation. Parental mediation includes a set of strategies used by
parents “to control, supervise or interpret media content for children ”(Warren, 2001 ,
p. 212). Previous research has suggested th at use of parental mediation is associated
with less overall time spent with, and less negative outcomes of media use (Gentile,
Nathanson, Rasmussen, Reimer, & Walsh, 2012 ; Kalmus, Blinka, & Olafsson, 2015 ).
However, the concept of a digital parenting style is broader than parental mediation
as it includes amount of guidance and inv olvement with child digital device use.
Additionally, the parenting style concept o ﬀers a dimensional view in which parental
behavior can be placed along the dimensions of warmth and demandingness. This also
emphasizes the emotional nature of these parenting styles rather than focusing solely
on parental behavior (as in case of parental mediation).JOURNAL OF CHILDREN AND MEDIA 931.1.2. Role-modelling in the context of MTSD use
Children learn observationally (social learning theory; Bandura, 1977 ) by attending to and
imitating people in their surroundings. They identify with the model and take on
observed behaviors, values, beliefs, and attitudes of the person. People in the immediate
surrounding of the child, especially parents, can more easily become role-models for the
child and role-modelling is an important aspect of parental in ﬂuence (e.g., on child eating
habits and obesity; Brown & Ogden, 2004 ). This is applicable to media consumption, as
parental media use has been shown to predict child media habits (Bleakley, Jordan, &
Hennessy, 2013 ; Lauricella, Wartella, & Rideout, 2015 ) especially in case of heavy parental
use (Rideout, Foehr, & Roberts, 2010 ; Woodard & Gridina, 2000 ). Examples include asso-
ciations between family TV time and child TV time (Cillero & Jago, 2010 ; Duch, Fisher,
Ensari, & Harrington, 2013 ) or parental smartphone or tablet-use and child device use
(Lauricella et al., 2015 ). Of note, it is not only overt parental behavior (i.e., digital device
use) but also attitudes and emotions that can be modelled for children to imitate. Yet, no
study focused on whether parental attachment to these devices is associated with child
MTSD use to date. Furthermore, beyond role-modelling, parental media use can also
inﬂuence child behavior insofar as it corresponds to less parental attention and other
resources allocated to the child. For example, parents who watch more TV (Kirkorian,
Pempek, Murphy, Schmidt, & Anderson, 2009 ) and who are heavy mobile users (Radesky,
Schumacher, & Zuckerman, 2015 ) engage in less parent –child interaction.
1.1.3. Other parental factors in ﬂuencing child MTSD use
1.1.3.1. Parental attitudes. Parents ’attitudes toward certain activities or habits predict
whether/to what extent/how their children will engage in those activities (e.g., eating
behavior; Scaglioni, Salvioni, & Galimberti, 2008 ). Parental role-modelling, practices, rules
and parenting style may all be in ﬂuenced by parental attitudes (as attitudes predict
behavior; Fishbein, & Ajzen, 1974 ). Parental attitudes toward child media use are mixed
and largely depend on media type (Rideout et al., 2010 ): while parental attitudes toward TV
use are mixed, they are more positive toward computer use (Rideout & Hamel, 2006 ). In
turn, more positive parental attitudes toward media are associated with longer child time
with those media (Cingel & Krcmar, 2013 ; Vandewater et al., 2007 ). However, to our knowl-
edge, only two studies examined this association in case of MTSDs (Lauricella et al., 2015 ;
Nikken & Schols, 2015 ;s e eb e l o wi nt h e “Parental Beliefs ”section). Furthermore, there is
disproportionate focus on cognitive aspects of attitudes, i.e., opinions about MTSD use at
the expense of focus on emotional aspects of those (Pooley & O ’Connor, 2000 ).
1.1.3.2. Parental beliefs. Beliefs are the cognitive source of attitudes (Fishbein, & Ajzen,
1975). Parental beliefs regarding child media use (traditional and digital) –such as whether
and at what age the media have negative or positive e ﬀects on the child –may in ﬂuence
the degree to which parents allow or encourage their children ’s media use, which in turn,
can in ﬂuence how much the child uses these devices. For example, parents who attribute
positive e ﬀects to digital media engage in co-use and active mediation, whereas parents
who are concerned about negative e ﬀects are more likely to restrict their child ’sm e d i au s e
(Nikken & Jansz, 2006 ; Nikken & Schols, 2015 ). In support, parents ’belief that TV can be
helpful is associated with increased child screen time (Vandewater et al., 2007 ) and parents
who think that media provide a source of entertainment/relaxation and who think that it94 V. KONOK ET AL.has positive e ﬀects tend to have children who spend more time with MTSD use (Lauricella
et al., 2015 ; Nikken & Schols, 2015 ). In addition to these aspects of parental attitudes and
behaviors, other aspects of the microsystem within which youth function, such as socio-
economic status (SES) and parental education, can also impact child habits, including
screen time or MTSD use. For example, higher SES and parental education are related to
less time child spent with mobile media (Common Sense Inc., 2017 ; though others did not
ﬁnd such association in a much less representative sample; Kabali et al., 2015 ).
Taken together, some data on the associations between parental attitudes, beliefs, and
role-modelling and child media use (including MTSD use) are available, but no studies to
date have focused on the existence of digital parenting styles or the associations thereof
with child media use. In addition, in most studies, children ’s media use was measured only
in terms of amount of use. However, the type of use, e.g., what kind of activities children
are doing on these devices is also comparably important, as di ﬀerent activities (e.g.,
watching videos, taking photos, playing games) could have di ﬀerent e ﬀects on cognitive
development. Additionally, the relationship between parental factors and these speci ﬁc
activities is also important to explore, e.g., whether certain parental attitudes are related
to more advanced activities.
1.2. Aims and hypothesis
Our main aim was to reveal whether parents ’digital parenting style, general attitude , and
beliefs regarding early MTSD use and role-modelling as indicated by their own mobile
attachment and use are associated with child digital activity indexed by the amount of
time and type of activity children engage in MTSD use.
1.2.1. Exploratory research questions
To this end, we ﬁrst identi ﬁed types of MTSD use (and user types) in children (Exploratory
Research Question 1 a, b) and investigated (Exploratory Research Question 2) whether
digital parenting styles can be identi ﬁed (and conceptually determine whether these
correspond to general parenting styles as described by Baumrind, 1991 ). Following an
explorative design, we relied on a data-driven analytic approach involving principal
component analysis (PCA) using items selected based on high-frequency responses in
an open-ended questionnaire survey.
Also exploratorily, we aimed to identify di ﬀerent kinds of parental beliefs regarding the
potential bene ﬁcial and harmful e ﬀects of early MTSD use (Exploratory Research Question 3).
1.2.2. Hypotheses
We hypothesized that children engage in MTSD use for a greater amount of time and in
a more active/advanced manner, if their parents: ( H1) have a permissive digital parenting
style, ( H2) have a more positive general attitude toward early MTSD use, ( H3) have more
positive cognitive concepts or beliefs (i.e., they attribute more bene ﬁcial and less harmful
eﬀects to early use), ( H4) also use their own mobile phone for greater amounts of time,
and ( H5) are more attached to their phone.
Variables that may have confounding e ﬀects on child MTSD use, such as parental
educational level and child age and sex (Kabali et al., 2015 ; Lauricella et al., 2015 ) were
accounted for.JOURNAL OF CHILDREN AND MEDIA 95Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, no data are available about how the age of
onset of MTSD use changed over the past years and it was our aim to investigate the
existence of such trends. Parents were asked to retrospectively report on when their child
ﬁrst engaged in MTSD use. We hypothesized (H6) that the age of onset of MTSD use has
been becoming earlier, and thus that younger children are more likely to be an MTSD user
by a given age than older children.
2. Method
2.1. Participants and procedure
Participants were recruited online, through F acebook and the website of a Hungarian online
magazine, where the study questionnaire ( Digital Kids Questionnaire ; see below) was adver-
tised. Parents were included if they had a child aged between 0 and 7 years. This age group
was chosen because we were interested in MTSD use in early childhood (Nores & Barnett,
2010 ): in this age, the e ﬀects of MTSD use on development could be bigger and more long-
lasting (Schoenmaker et al., 2015 )a n dt h ei n ﬂuence of parents on their child behavior is
relatively greater (Laible et al., 2000 ) than during later ages. Additionally, based on results of
our open-ended survey (see below), we assumed that in children older than 7 years, there
would be less variability in experience with MTSD use. A total of 1283 parents completed the
Digital Kids Questionnaire ;1 3w e r ee x c l u d e dd u et oi n c o n s i s t e n tr e s p o n d i n g .T h e ﬁnal sample
thus consisted of 1270 parents who reported on 680 boys and 590 girls (see Table 1 for
descriptive statistics). Parents with more than one child in this age group were asked to

Parents who completed the questionnaire were entered into a lottery involving two
drugstore vouchers (5000 HUF).
The study sample was di ﬀerent from the average Hungarian population ( http://www.ksh.
hu) insofar as female respondents (82.8%), thos e with at least a college degree (74.3%) and
those living in the capital city (55.2%) were overrepresented.
Completing the questionnaire took approximately 20 –30 minutes. Data collection took
place between May and August of 2016.
2.2. Measure: Digital Kids Questionnaire
This questionnaire was based on the earlier open-ended survey completed by parents
(N= 96) of children aged between 0 and 10 years. Based on open-ended survey responses,
an inductive content analysis (Elo & Kyngäs, 2008 ) was conducted, via compilation of a code
book from each unique response and creation of higher-order categories from these (if ≥5%
of the respondents gave the respective answers, a category was created). The obtained
categories were then used in the Digital Kids Questionnaire as forced-choice (yes/no) items of
the digital parenting style and parental beliefs questions.
Theﬁnal version1was comproed of questions about the following (variable names
indicated with italics).
Demographics: We asked about age and sex of the child ( child age, child sex) , age and
sex of the child ’s parent who completed study questionnaires (parental age and parental
sex)and the highest level of education of the child ’s both parents (parental education).96 V. KONOK ET AL.Table 1. Independent and dependent variables: de ﬁnitions, measurements, and descriptive statistics, where applicable/interpretable.

Parental education Variable with 6 levels: 1 = elementary school; 2 = technical school; 3 = high school; 4 = bachelor ’s
degree/college; 5 = master ’s degree/university; 6 = doctoral degree/postgraduate. A mean
score was computed from the two parents ’educational levels, when available.1 6 4.25 0.83
Digital Parenting Styles Variable with 16 response choices2(based on the obtained categories of the open-ended version
of the questionnaire) and an “other ”option. A principal component analysis was carried out,
and PCA scores were used for subsequent analyses.N/A (principal component scores)
Parental Mobile Use Activities of interest were: web-browsing, listening to music, watching movies or videos, reading
books, editing/reading documents, reading/sending e-mails, accessing social networking sites,
camera, games, chat. Parents had to rate on a 5-grade scale how frequently (from “never ”to
“daily ”) they use their phone for the activity.
A total Parental mobile use score ( α= 0.802; good) was computed and used in analyses.1 5 2.98 0.89
Parental Mobile Attachment Variable included four items from the Mobile Attachment Questionnaire (Konok et al., 2017 ), one
from each subscale3. Parents had to rate each statement on a 5-grade –scale, based on how
characteristic it was for them.
A total Parental mobile attachment score ( α= 0.742; acceptable) was computed and used for
analysis.1 5 2.35 0.95
Parental Attitude Variable expressed as agreement with either that it is better for a child to start MTSD use “as late
as possible ”(negative attitude, 1 point) or “as early as possible ”(positive attitude, 3 point), or
with neither (neutral/mixed attitude, 2 point). This three-level ordinal variable was used in
analyses.NNegative attitude = 408
NNeutral/Mixed Attitude = 589
NPositive Attitued = 273
Beliefs about harms Parents were asked whether there are any harmful/bene ﬁcial consequences of early MTSD use
and, if yes, what those are (with 194and 135response options, respectively, based on the
obtained categories of the open-ended version of the questionnaire). For the analyses, a total
Beliefs about harms (α= 0.803; good) and Beliefs about bene ﬁts(α= 0.774; acceptable) score
was computed (but a PCA was also carried out). Responses indicating that early MTSD use has
no potential harmful/bene ﬁcial consequences corresponded to a score of zero on Beliefs about
harms/Beliefs about bene ﬁtssubscale.0 16 6.13 4.23
Beliefs about bene ﬁts 0 13 4.70 3.74
Dependent variables Amount of MTSD use Parents were asked about the frequency (with 8 levels) and duration (with 7 levels) of the child ’s
MTSD use. The combination of these two data was used as a dependent variable in the
analyses6(minutes/day).0 360 13.01 30.84
Type of user Parents were asked about the activities their child engages in on the device/s (hereafter labelled
“Activities ”): with 33 response choices, e.g., “uses touchscreen ”,“plays with games ”,“watches
movies ”and an “other ”option). We ran a PCA on these items, and a cluster analysis based on
the PCA scores. Cluster membership was used as dependent variable in analyses.See Supplemental Material 3 for
cluster frequenciesJOURNAL OF CHILDREN AND MEDIA 97Characteristics of the Child MTSD Use : Parents were asked whether their child uses
a tablet/smartphone regularly, and if yes, about the frequency and duration of the child ’s
MTSD use (amount of MTSD use) , and the typical activities the child engages in on the
MTSD (activities).
Digital Parenting Styles: Parents were asked how they react to situations wherein the
child showed interest in an MTSD device (digital parenting style).
Parental Role-Modelling: Questions were asked about the frequency of parental mobile
use for various activities (based on Konok, Gigler, Bereczky, & Miklósi, 2016 ; Konok, Pogány, &
Miklósi, 2017 ;parental mobile use) , and about parental behavior and feeling characteristics of
attachment to their mobile phones (based on Konok et al., 2017 ;parental mobile attachment).
Parental Attitude: We assessed parents ’general attitude toward early MTSD use
(parental attitude) .
Parental Beliefs: We asked parents about their opinions about possible harmful and
beneﬁcial consequences of early MTSD use (beliefs about harms, Beliefs about bene ﬁts).
For the exact measurements of these questions (presented according to whether they
were used as dependent or independent variables in the analyses) see Table 1 .
2.3. Statistical analyses
Assumptions of statistical tests were considered prior to analyses (SPSS 22.0.0.).
Four principal component analyses (PCAs) with Varimax rotation were conducted on
the Activities (Q6), Parenting styles (Q8), Beliefs about harms (Q11) and Beliefs about
beneﬁts (Q13) items, separately. Although PCA is generally suggested for continuous
data, it is considered appropriate for binary data as well (Gower, 1966 ; Jolliﬀe,2002 ; Vyas &
Kumaranayake, 2006 ).
Items with a 0.4 or greater loading on a particular component were retained
(Tabachnick & Fidell, 2001 ). Items with a 0.4 or greater loading on more than one
component were considered to cross-load and removed. The number of ﬁnal components
was determined based on both the eigenvalues (greater than 1) and the scree plot.
A two-step cluster analysis (distance: log-likelihood, clustering: BIC) was carried out to
classify children into groups on the basis of their activity types (Activities principal
component scores) and amount of MTSD use. The validity of the clusters was checked
using discriminant function analysis with leave-one-out cross-validation. Clusters were
also compared on each predictor variable using Kruskal –Wallis tests to see what level of
these variables characterise the clusters.
The association between Parenting styles principal component scores (independent vari-
ables; IVs) and children ’sAmount of use (dependent variable; DV) was examined using
a General Linear Model (GLM) ( n= 535; as parenting styles questions were only asked of
parents of regular MTSD users). A separa te GLM was carried out on the total sample ( N= 1270)
with parents ’scores on the Parental attitude, Beliefs about harms total score, Beliefs about
bene ﬁtstotal score, Mobile use ,a n d Mobile attachment total scores, parental education, child
age and sex as IVs and children ’sAmount of use as the DV (see Table 1 for list of IVs and DVs).
For those who responded that their child do es not regularly use MTSDs, the value for Amount
of use was set to zero.
To determine the extent to which parent variables ( Parental attitude, Parenting styles
principal component scores, Beliefs about harms, Beliefs about bene ﬁts, Mobile use, Mobile98 V. KONOK ET AL.attachment total scores and parental education) and child variables (age and sex) as IVs are
associated with child cluster membership ( Activities , DV), an ordinal logistic Generalized
Linear Model (GzLM) was estimated for the regular MTSD user subsample ( n=5 3 5 ) .
All GLM and GzLM initial models included main e ﬀects but not interactions. Stepwise
model selection with backwards elimination was used based on p-values.
To test whether children start using MTSDs earlier today than a few years ago, the ratio
of children who had and who had not started MTSD use before their 3rd birthday (Q5)
were compared between age groups using Chi-square tests (age group and MTSD use
before the 3rd birthday were the categorical variables, and Chi-square tests were ran
separately for mobile and tablet use). Only data of children at least 3 years old were used
in the analysis. The third birthday was chosen because setting this limit at an older age
(e.g., age 4), there would have been too few groups to compare (i.e., 4-, 5-, 6-, and 7-year-
olds), but setting it at a younger age (e.g., 2), there would have been too few children who
started MTSD use before their second birthday.
2.4. Ethical statement
This study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and national and
international guidelines (i.e., the Hungarian and the American Psychological Association)

3.1. Identifying types of MTSD use/users
3.1.1. Types of use (exploratory research question 1a)
For descriptive statistics on the ratio of regular MTSD users to nonusers, and regular users ’
average time spent with MTSD use across di ﬀerent age groups, see Supplemental Material 1.
The PCA of the Activities items indicated three components (Supplemental Material 2).
Items 8, 13, 21, 26, 16, 29, 6, 15, and 28 were removed iteratively (in the listed order) due to
poor or to cross-loading. The three components were interpreted as Non-functional use (the
child uses the MTSD not for its designated functions, but as a toy or object generally, e.g.,
chews it or randomly pushes the buttons), Functional-active use (the child uses the MTSD for
its designated functions, autonomously and ac tively, e.g., launches applications or makes
calls) and Functional-passive use (the child uses the MTSD for its designated functions, but in
a passive way, i.e., participates in an activity tha t is typically initiated by someone, e.g., watches
videos but does not launch them). The three components together explained 45.5% of the
total variance.
3.1.2. Types of users (exploratory research question 1b)
The cluster analysis indicated three clusters (Supplemental Material 3): Beginners (children
who use the MTSD for short amounts of time and mainly for non-functional activities),
Passive/light users (who use the MTSD for moderate amounts of time, and mainly for
functional-passive activities), and Active/heavy users (who use the MTSD for long amountsJOURNAL OF CHILDREN AND MEDIA 99of time and mainly for functional-active activities). The three clusters were well distin-
guishable (discriminant analysis with cross-validation: 98.8% success rate) from each other
based on the types of use (principal component scores) and amount of use. The three
clusters di ﬀered from each other on Activities principal component scores and amount of
MTSD use variables (Kruskal –Wallis tests, all ps<0.01). Pairwise di ﬀerences are indicated in
Supplemental Material 3.
3.2. Parents ’behavior and attitudes toward their child ’s MTSD use
3.2.1. Digital parenting styles (exploratory research question 2)
The PCA of the Parenting styles items indicated four components (Supplemental
Material 4). Items 11, 12, 16 were removed iteratively (in the listed order) due to cross-
loading. The four components corresponded to established parenting styles and were
thus interpreted as Permissive (the parent not only permits the child to use the MTSD, but
also shows how to use it or gives information), Authoritative (the parent permits the use
but with some limitations/conditions), Authoritarian (the parent restricts/prohibits the
usage or permits it only sometimes), and Laissez-faire (the parent permits the child to use
the MTSD in order to engage him/her). The four components together explained 48.3% of
the total variance.
3.2.2. Parental beliefs about potential harms and bene ﬁts of early MTSD use
(exploratory research question 3)
The majority (66%) of parents agreed both with the statement that MTSD use has
negative e ﬀects and the statement that it has positive e ﬀects on children.
Parents who agreed that using a tablet/smartphone in early childhood can have harmful
consequences (82%, n= 1041), were asked in what way they believed MTSD use can
potentially harm their children (see Table 1 for descriptives). The PCA on Beliefs about harms
items indicated three components (Supplemental Material 5). Items 17, 6, and 15 were
removed iteratively (in the listed order) due t o cross-loading. The three components were:
Disturbs development (early MTSD use disturbs/does not improve normal development/can
cause problems in development), Takes time from other things (early MTSD use takes time and
inclination away from other areas of life and/o r reduces interest or motivation to engage in
other developmentally typical activities) and Danger/addiction (early MTSD use is dangerous or
can be addictive). The three components toget her explained 40.7% of the total variance.
Parents who agreed that using a tablet/smartphone in early childhood can have
beneﬁcial consequences (77%, n= 981), were asked in what way they believed MTSD
use can potentially bene ﬁt their children (see Table 1 for descriptives). The PCA of Beliefs
about bene ﬁts items indicated four components (Supplemental Material 6): Openness/
entertainment (MTSD use makes the child more open to the world/new things and
provides an opportunity for entertainment), Skill-improvement (MTSD use improves gen-
eral skills), Information/learning (MTSD use aids learning new things/obtaining informa-
tion about the world) and Digital skills (MTSD use improves digital skills/aids learning
informatics). The four components together explained 53% of the total variance.100 V. KONOK ET AL.3.3. Associations of child and parent variables with the extent and type of child
MTSD use
3.3.1. Associations of child and parent variables with amount of use
Theﬁrst GLM supported H1: children of parents who have a permissive (parameter
estimate = 4.407; SE = 1.61; Wald χ2₁= 7.490; p= 0.006) or authoritative (parameter
estimate = 3.848; SE = 1.61; Wald χ2₁=5 . 7 1 2 ; p= 0.017) digital parenting style, engages
in more MTSD use whereas children of pare nts who have an authoritarian digital
parenting style (parameter estimate = −8.812; SE = 1.61; χ2₁= 29.947; p< 0.001) engage
in less MTSD use.
The second GLM supported H2-H5 except for H4: if the parent has a more positive
attitude toward early MTSD use ( H2), considers early MTSD use less harmful and more
beneﬁcial ( H3), has higher mobile attachment ( H5), then the child spends more time with
MTSD use. Contrary to hypotheses, parental mobile use was not associated with child
Amount of use in ( H4). Regarding the confounding variables, older children and children
of less-educated parents spend more time with MTSD use, but child sex was not asso-
ciated with Amount of use (Supplemental Material 7).
3.3.2. Associations of child and parent variables with types of users (clusters)
Findings suggested that if the parent is higher on permissive or the authoritative digital
parenting style and lower score on the authoritarian style ( H1), if (s)he attributes more
beneﬁcial eﬀects to early MTSD use ( H3), is less educated and if the child is older, then the
child is more likely to be a more advanced user (i.e., to belong to higher cluster). Sex of the
child had no association with Amount of use. H2, H4 , and H5were not supported as
Parental attitude, parental Mobile usage and Mobile attachment were not associated with
Amount of use in the child (Supplemental Material 8).
3.4. Change in the age of ﬁrst MTSD use over the last years
Whether or not children started using mobile phones ( χ2= 78.44; Φ= 0.31; p< 0.001) or
tablets ( χ2= 52.78; Φ= 0.26; p< 0.001) before their 3rd birthday depended on age groups:
in support of H6, younger children were more likely an MTSD user by their third birthday
than older children ( Figure 1 ).
4. Discussion
4.1. Digital parenting styles and their associations with children ’s MTSD use
To our knowledge, the current study is the ﬁrst to provide evidence for the existence of
digital parenting styles and for the association between such styles and amount and type
of child MTSD use. Taking an explorative approach, we identi ﬁed comparable parenting
styles in relation to children ’s MTSD use as those identi ﬁed in case of internet (Valcke et al.,
2010 ) and general (Baumrind, 1971 ) parenting styles.
Parents displaying a permissive digital parenting style allow their children to engage in
MTSD use, but they are also nurturing and inter active. For example, parents with this style
show their child how to use the application/device and answer the child ’s questions. As such,
permissive digital parenting is associated with low levels of demandingness and high levels ofJOURNAL OF CHILDREN AND MEDIA 101involvement/warmth. From the perspective of a parental mediation framework, permissive
parents likely engage in active/interactive mediation (Nikken & Jansz, 2006 ).
Conversely, authoritative digital parenting refers to a parenting style where MTSD use is
permitted but only under certain conditions (e.g., only after the child has attended to his/her
chores and obligations) and/or with certain limitations (e.g., time limits). Authoritative
digital parenting is thus characterized by high levels of demandingness and high levels of
involvement/warmth. Additionally, consistent with authoritative parenting involving
encouragement of child autonomy (Baumrind, 1971 ), parents with an authoritative digital
parenting style tend to not lock the device screen when they give it to the child or strictly
supervise use. Authoritative parents use some mixture of restrictive and active/interactive
mediation (setting limits and conditions; Nikken & Jansz, 2006 ).
Parents exhibiting an authoritarian digital parenting style restrict/prohibit child MTSD
use and this parenting style is thus associated with high levels of demandingness and low
levels of involvement/warmth. Only one item that loaded strongly onto this component
describes some level of parental involvement, but even this item is a combination of
statements re ﬂecting di ﬀerent degrees of involvement ( “We do not give it to her/him, we
only show it/we watch the pictures/videos together ”). Therefore, authoritarian parents
use restrictive mediation and supervision (Nikken & Jansz, 2006 ).
Parents who adopt a laissez-faire digital parenting style allow their children to use the
device in order to engage him/her, suggesting that –at least in this context –they are not
nurturing or interactive. This digital parenting style is thus characterized by low demand-
ingness and low involvement/warmth. Laissez-faire parents do not engage in mediation.
Parenting styles are related to child development and outcomes (e.g., Kordi & Baharudin,
2010 ) yet little is known about the associations between digital parenting styles and child
digital device use. Consistent with our hypotheses, parents ’digital parenting style is
associated with amount and type of child MTSD use. Furthermore, it appears that this
association is driven primarily not by degree of parental demandingness, but by parental
Figure 1. Ratio of children who had and had not used mobile phone/tablet before their 3rd birthday in
diﬀerent age groups, reported by Hungarian parents. The ratios were calculated retrospectively from
parents ’reports about the age when their child started to use the devices.102 V. KONOK ET AL.involvement/warmth. Permissive and authoritative parenting was associated with longer
durations of MTSD use and more active or advanced use in children. In case of authoritarian
digital parenting, children use MTSDs for shorter durations of time and in a rather passive or
non-functional way. The degree to which parents exhibited a laissez-faire style was not
associated with amount of child MTSD use. This is in contrast with ﬁndings on school-aged
children ’s internet use, whose parental demandingness (permissive and laissez-faire styles)
was shown to be negatively associated with increased internet use (Özgür, 2016 ). However,
in contrast with older children and adolescents who possess the necessary skills and
knowledge to use Internet or digital devices (including MTSDs), and only need parental
permission to do so, young children may need guidance and support to learn MTSD use
and, as such, use them more if their parents have a warmer parenting style.
4.2. Associations of parental attitudes, beliefs, and role-modelling with children ’s
MTSD use
As expected, the more positive attitude the parents have regarding early MTSD use, the
more time the child spends engaging in such use. This result is consistent with earlier
ﬁndings indicating that positive attitudes toward media were related to higher rates of
child media consumption (Cingel & Krcmar, 2013 ).
Parental attitudes may be in ﬂuenced by parents ’beliefs about potential bene ﬁts and
harm of early MTSD use. In the current study, the positive and negative e ﬀects parents
attributed to early MTSD use were similar to those reported by Nikken and Schols ( 2015 ): it
improves the child ’s knowledge and skills, is an entertainment opportunity, but it can also
be dangerous (e.g., inappropriate content or inappropriate use, abuse by others) and
developmentally inappropriate. Parents in the current sample additionally reported that
a disadvantage of MTSDs is that they take time away from other activities.
In line with our hypotheses, we found t hat parents who attribute more bene ﬁts and less
harm to early MTSD use have children who spen dm o r et i m ew i t hM T S Du s e .T h i sc o r r e s p o n d s
to prior data on TV and media, which suggest th at parents who believe TV can be helpful have
children who watch more TV (Vandewater et al., 2007 ) and also that parental worries about
media are negatively related to chi ld TV consumption (Cingel & Krcmar, 2013 ). The majority
(66%) of our participants reported that they believed early MTSD use has both positive and
negative e ﬀects which are also consistent with earlier ﬁndings (Radesky et al., 2016 ).
Additionally, we found that parents who are less educated have children who spend
more time with MTSD use, consistent with what has been found with regard to child TV
screen time (Hesketh, Ball, Crawford, Campbell, & Salmon, 2007 ). Better educated parents
may be more aware of the problematic aspects of (TV or) mobile phone use and thus
consider these in their parenting (Roser, Schoeni, Foerster, & Röösli, 2016 ). Thus, educa-
tional background may in ﬂuence child MTSD use through in ﬂuencing beliefs and atti-
tudes with regard to early MTSD use.
Contrary to hypotheses and the ﬁndings of Lauricella et al. ( 2015 )a n dP e m p e ka n d
McDaniel ( 2016 ), amount of parental mobile use was not, but degree of parental mobile
attachment was, associated with amount of child MTSD use. This may be because it is not only
through their behavior but also through their attitudes and emotions that parents can be
role-models for their child. Parents ’higher mobile attachment may contribute to children
developing positive attitudes toward MTSDs and, as their parents are also more likely to allowJOURNAL OF CHILDREN AND MEDIA 103device use, to children using MTSDs more freque ntly. From another perspective, parents who
are highly emotionally involved in digital media may have less attentional resources to interact
with their child, resulting in the child engaging him/herself via some other means (e.g., with
MTSD use). Investigating these and other putative mediating mechanisms (e.g., role-
modelling, parenting styles and practices, h ome environment) between parental mobile
attachment and child MTSD use are important nex t steps for future research. Additionally,
some parents may refrain from using the smartph one in front of the child, while others do not,
and this may depend on their mobile attachme nt: those who have high mobile attachment
may not be able or willing to control their mobile use in front of the child. This can explain why
only parental mobile attachment, and not mobil e use is associated with child MTSD use. In the
future, parental mobile use should be investig ated separately based on whether it occurs in
front of the child or not.
4.3. Age of onset of MTSD use
Our results support the hypothesis that chil dren are starting to use MTSDs at a younger age
than was the case earlier (insofar as older children were less likely to have started MTSD use
b e f o r et h ea g eo f3t h a ny o u n g e rc h i l d r e n ) .I nc o n trast to the professional recommendations
to discourage or prohibit digital media use in c hildren under the age of 2 (American Academy
of Pediatrics, 2016 ;2018 ), more than one-third of the chil dren between the ages of 1 and 2 in
our sample were reported to have started MTSD use. Given signi ﬁcant neural plasticity at this
age (Schoenmaker et al., 2015 ), the observed trend calls for increased empirical study of the
various e ﬀects of early MTSD use.
4.4. Association of children ’s age with their MTSD use
Results show that as children get older, they spend more time with MTSD use (as in Kabali
et al., 2015 ; Lauricella et al., 2015 ; Roser et al., 2016 ). The proportion of regular MTSD users
also considerably increased with age, perhaps because MTSDs o ﬀer more opportunities
for older children who have more advanced cognitive and motor capabilities: the results
show that they typically use the MTSDs in a more advanced way.
4.5. Limitations and future directions
Although our ﬁndings establish important associations, our research design is not suitable for
causal inferences. Of note, we cannot rule ou tt h a ts o m ev a r i a b l e s ,s u c ha sc h i l dM T S Du s e
aﬀects parenting style, parental attitude/bel ief or parental mobile attachment and not the
other way around (or that there is a bidirectional e ﬀect). For example, it is possible that if the
child uses MTSDs more, parents develop more positive attitude and beliefs, either because
they experience positive/no negative consequ ences of the MTSD use or because of cognitive
dissonance reduction (Festinger, 1957 ). Similarly, not only can parenting style in ﬂuence child
characteristics, but the reverse is also possible (P adilla-Walker, Carlo, Christensen, & Yorgason,
2012 ). Additionally, it is also possible t hat parent variables indirectly a ﬀect children ’sM T S D
use. We referred to the possibility of di ﬀerent mediating and moder ating mechanisms. These
alternatives are hardly observable as experim ental studies in this topic are not possible to
carry out, but longitudinal studies may clarify some of these questions.104 V. KONOK ET AL.Another limitation to our study is that we observed digital parenting styles (parental
reactions to child MTSD use) only in parents who reported that their child shows interest
toward MTSDs. However, parents may o ﬀer MTSDs to the child even if he/she does not show
interest toward it, so parents can be proactive, not only reactive in their behaviors regarding
child MTSD use. This experimental consideration should be addressed in the future.
One of the strength of our study is its data-driven approach. Instead of pre-selected
questions (i.e., a theory-driven approach), we explored parents ’attitudes and behaviors
exerting as little in ﬂuence on those as possible. Nevertheless, the questionnaire will need
further validation in the future.
Although a recent study showed that when people are asked about how often they use
their mobile phone, the correlations are quite high between self-report and objective log-
data (Boase, & Ling, 2013 ), parents might have distorted their responses regarding their
mobile use and mobile attachment, especially given that these questions were asked after
parents described their opinions, attitudes and parenting behaviors related to child MTSD
use. Therefore, the order of questions may be bene ﬁcial to reverse in future studies.
Variables not assessed in this study may also be linked to child MTSD use. For example,
although we measured how much the parent uses their mobile phone and to what extent
they are attached to it, it would be also important to measure how much time the parent
uses their mobile phone (or other devices) in front of the children.
Parental mediation techniques could be also investigated in relation to digital parent-
ing styles, e.g., are digital parenting styles involve certain speci ﬁc mediation techniques as
we hypothesize above? To what extent are the two phenomena overlapping?
Additionally, a possible contribution in future studies could be to investigate whether
parents ’general parenting style and digital parenting style correspond or diverge. For
example, is it possible that a parent has a permissive digital parenting style, but an author-
itative general parenting style?
4.6. Conclusions
In conclusion, results suggest that parents may in ﬂuence their children ’sM T S Du s e ,t h r o u g h
modelling behavior, digital parenting style, attitudes and beliefs about early MTSD use, and
their educational level. Future studies should clarify how these variables are related, includ-
ing by assessing potential mediating and moderating mechanisms, and examining whether
digital parenting styles explain child MTSD use above and beyond other parental factors.
As children start to use MTSDs at an increasingly early age, and for increasing amounts
of time as they get older, it is predictable that MTSD use will further intensify in children
during the upcoming years. Adults exhibit attachment to their mobile devices (Konok
et al., 2017 ) and this attachment is not only also observable but may be more pronounced
in youth and this may potentially result in youth spending less time spent with other
(developmentally appropriate and important) activities and toys. Thus, there is urgent
need to examine possible e ﬀects of MTSD use on development. If ﬁndings indicate that
early MTSD use has some negative consequences on child development, in combination
with the current results, the data may suggest that a reduction in child MTSD use can be
achieved via changes in their parents ’attitudes and knowledge, i.e., parental education
(Hinkley, Cli ﬀ, & Okely, 2015 ).JOURNAL OF CHILDREN AND MEDIA 105Notes
