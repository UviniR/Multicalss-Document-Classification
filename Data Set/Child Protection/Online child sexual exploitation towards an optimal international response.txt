ABSTRACT
Eﬀorts have been made in recent years to ensure there is su ﬃcient
capacity within nation states to respond to, and combat, Online
Child Sexual Exploitation (OCSE). The UK-led WeProtect Global
Alliance initiative has outlined a Model National Response (MNR),to which a large number of nations have already committed.
OCSE, like cybercrime, is very often a crime with international
dimensions. If we could start again knowing what we know now
about OCSE, what would a model international response look like?
Does this help us identify gaps in the existing internationalresponse that can be opportunities for improvement? This article
maps an optimal international response to the problem of OCSE.
Drawing on and complementing the We Protect Global Alliance
Model National Response (MNR), it highlights aspects peculiar to
the international nature of OCSE and suggests areas for futureoperational coordination and research.ARTICLE HISTORY

Setting the scene - what is online child sexual exploitation (OCSE)?1
The group of criminal activities today commonly referred to as ‘online child sexual exploi-
tation ’may be most easily –if at times arti ﬁcially –categorised as content-related or
contact-related. Content-related activities have traditionally focused on the production,
distribution and possession of what is often called ‘child pornography ’in national legisla-
tive instruments and by the popular media, but which is classi ﬁed as ‘child sexual abuse
material ’by those working in child protection.2Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) may
be broadly de ﬁned, currently, as photographs or videos that depict children in erotic
poses; child nudity with focus on the genital area; and children engaged in sexual activity
–be this with peers, adults or alone.
Contact-related activities, meanwhile, can be classi ﬁed most simply as serious sexual
oﬀences against children, such as rape and sexual assault. While these o ﬀences are by
no means new, it is generally agreed that over the last 10 –15 years, mobile phone and
internet technologies have a ﬀorded much greater opportunity than before for individuals
to make contact with children for sexual purposes (Baines 2008 ; Quayle and Koukopoulos
2018 ; UNODC 2015 ).
This article considers international responses to the interrelated activities shown in

https://doi.org/10.1080/23738871.2019.1635178While due consideration has been given to some countries ’recent moves to criminalise
‘sexual chat ’between adults and minors, this is not included in the schema above due to
an absence of international consensus on its criminal status.
What are the goals of combating OCSE?
Researchers have used a number of approaches to assist in the formulation of response
measures to child sexual exploitation. Considering OCSE as a crime problem naturally
prompts responses whose chief objectives are crime prevention, detection and control.
This is an approach with which law enforcement intelligence analysts and child protectionspecialists will be familiar. Since the scope of this research is content and contact widelydeemed to be criminal, a response model focused on criminal justice and crime prevention
is therefore an obvious choice.
A growing number of researchers have proposed, as an alternative, the public health
model, which views OCSE as a societal problem.
3As Wortley and Smallbone ( 2012 )
explain, the public health model provides for three levels of prevention:
.Primary, targeting whole populations;
.Secondary, targeting at-risk groups; and
.Tertiary, targeting those already identi ﬁed as having a problem.
Existing prevention measures, such as online safety tools, awareness programmes and
removal of CSAM are population-based strategies that sit ﬁrmly within primary prevention
of OCSE.4Support services for those at risk of o ﬀending or victimisation would constitute
secondary prevention, o ﬀender treatment programmes and victim support tertiary
prevention.
Considering the wide range of activities shown in Figure 1, it seems helpful to develop
responses that combine both public health and criminal justice approaches, and to ensurethat speci ﬁc functions and measures are aligned to the following high-level goals:
Figure 1. Online Child Sexual Exploitation activities.2 V. BAINES.Protect children
.Control o ﬀending5
Under these functional headings can be housed an array of responses from the ﬁelds of
public health, criminal justice and crime prevention. For example, ‘protecting children’ can
describe the work of law enforcement o ﬃcials, social workers, and educators. ‘Controlling
oﬀending ’can be the work of prisons, but also of therapists providing support to individ-
uals seeking to manage their sexual interest in children. As the response to OCSE is cur-
rently organised at national and international levels, some stakeholders are actively
involved in both protecting children and controlling o ﬀending.
A related approach that sees OCSE as a commodity-based activity –be this in the form
of CSAM or o ﬄine contact with children and young people –would set the goals in the
context of economic theory, as follows:
.Reduce supply (of children for online and o ﬄine sexual contact, and of CSAM); and
.Reduce demand (for online and o ﬄine sexual contact with children, and for CSAM).
This is closer to some of the models applied to organised crime, which view illegitimate
business structures as functioning in a broadly similar fashion to legitimate business. Thecomparison is sound in so far as CSAM is commoditized (produced or distributed forpayment, or as a currency in itself) and in as much as production and distribution may
involve online networking of like-minded individuals.
OCSE conforms to the principles of supply and demand to some degree, but there are
diﬀerent emotional a ﬀordances at work, not least sexual gratiﬁ cation in many (but not all)
cases. Application of the organised crime model is stretched, particularly in those cases of
one-on-one sexual exploitation of a child where there is no ﬁnancial element, and no
apparent attempt to further commoditise CSAM produced. But even here, we may posit
that equipping children to avoid victimisation would help reduce levels of o ﬀending.
Closer parallels can be found in the online coercion of children and young people to
produce further self-generated sexual content, and the production of sexual content inreturn for inducements. In either scenario, the threat of public exposure or the promise
of gain helps to ensure compliance with an o ﬀender’ s wishes.
Each of the theoretical approaches discussed above can be used to inform the develop-
ment of e ﬀective responses to OCSE and to align with the two high-level goals of protecting
children and managing o ﬀending. The international response model proposed in this article
draws on them directly, presenting an ideal against which existing policy responses can be
measured, free from the constraints of established organisational structures.
The WeProtect global Alliance model national response (MNR)
The WeProtect Global Alliance is the result of the merging of two international initiatives tocombat OCSE: the UK-led WeProtect, launched in 2013, and the joint US/EU Global Alliance
Against Child Sexual Abuse Online, launched in 2012. It is ‘an international movement
dedicated to national and global action to end the sexual exploitation of children
online ’, and now counts 82 countries, 20 technology companies and 24 civil society and
international organisations among its members.
6JOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY 3The initiative ’sﬂagship document is the WeProtect Model National Response (MNR), the
intention of which is to ‘help a country evaluate its current response, identify gaps, prior-
itise national e ﬀorts to ﬁll those gaps and, by establishing a common set of aspirations for
all countries, enhance international cooperation ’.7It sets out 21 desired capabilities for sig-
natory countries8:

It is not the intention of this article to subject the MNR to a full critique, not least because
its professed scope of ‘Preventing and Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse ’is wider
than online child sexual exploitation. Nevertheless, one can observe from the above that the
MNR groups responses variously, according to function (governance, communication),approach (societal, criminal justice), sector (industry) and individual stakeholder (victim).
From a methodological perspective it is therefore something of a hybrid, perhaps re ﬂecting4 V. BAINESthe complexity of the issue and of the measures already being delivered in countries whose
responses are deemed to be the most advanced or sophisticated.
By design, the MNR makes recommendations for national sovereign capabilities. But
since the majority of OCSE has an international component9, it may be asserted that
national capabilities alone are insu ﬃcient to combat OCSE e ﬀectively. As the 2018 WePro-
tect Global Threat Assessment acknowledges:
Solely focusing on a national level response will not meet the international challenges of this
global threat. Recognition of this fact is the ﬁrst step to developing more collaborative and
therefore e ﬀective approaches to safeguarding and justice.10
Accordingly, this article proposes a new model for responding to OCSE that outlines the
optimal response functions with particular focus on the international level.
An optimal international response to OCSE
Modelling method
A review was conducted of academic publications; grey literature, such as law enforcementthreat assessments and reports by non-governmental organisations; and open sourcematerial including public statements and media coverage. From this were identi ﬁed estab-
lished and emerging trends in OCSE, proposed approaches to combating them, progress todate and operational challenges. This in turn enabled mapping of both the functionsrequired for an optimal international response ( Figure 2 ) and the existing stakeholder
environment ( Figure 3 ). The free software SimpleMind was used to map the models.
11
Figure 2 was then circulated among professionals with specialist experience of combat-
ing OCSE in law enforcement, industry, non-governmental and other international organ-
isations. Review by this group validated the model, and a number of amendments were
made based on their feedback.12
The model
Figure 2 maps the functions identi ﬁed as optimal for combating OCSE e ﬀectively, in line with the
top-level goals of protecting children and controlling o ﬀending. The choice of a function-based
approach, rather than one based on stakeholders o r capabilities, is deliberate. The aim is to envi-
sion an ideal response informed by what we know about OCSE in 2019, independent of the
organisational structures hitherto developed to respond to the problem. It makes the assump-
tion that even the proudest and most partisan of stakeholders can identify things that couldhave been done di ﬀerently or better, had the various national and international responses to
OCSE not developed rapidly in reaction to a large and unforeseen increase in such crimes.
Consequently, this research does not take as a given that the existing structures for
responding to OCSE are optimal, even in those countries with the most extensive or soph-isticated provision.
Discussion
The model comprises a single global set of responses, to be delivered at national and inter-national levels to varying degrees. This approach has been chosen to maximise utility for
all specialist stakeholders and non-specialists alike.JOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY 5Figure 2. Proposed international model for responding to Online Child Sexual Exploitation.6 V. BAINESMapping functions in this way highlights a number of aspects worthy of further con-
sideration. In the ﬁrst instance, viewing existing policy responses through a lens of the
ideal allows for the identi ﬁcation of gaps and opportunities for improvement. In the
second, numerous overlaps between functions make evident that none of them can
operate in isolation. For example, victim identi ﬁcation is an activity of law enforcement
in the course of a criminal investigation but may also be part of an international crisis
response in the event of a live instance of sexual extortion of a child.
The goal of controlling or managing o ﬀending sits across disruption, therapeutic
support, criminal justice and awareness/prevention to varying degrees. Technical measuresto prevent convicted o ﬀenders, or those exhibiting o ﬀending behaviours, from accessing
online services through which they can contact children; legal approaches that impose
oﬄine restrictions and requirements in order to reduce opportunity and therefore risk;
behavioural therapy and live advice from a helpline such as StopItNow!, may all assist an
individual at risk of o ﬀending against children to manage their own impulses. Law enforce-
ment initiatives such as the European Union ’s Police2Peer may seek to divert suspected
downloaders of CSAM towards support services by intervening directly on peer-to-peerﬁlesharing platforms.
13In order to be accurate and useful, Insight & Analysis will necessarily
rely on intelligence and information from all of the other functions.
Prevention is a fundamental theme of several of the top-level functions and numerous
response measures shown. It inevitably dominates the awareness/prevention responseslisted, especially target hardening, in the form of safety programmes for children and
their guardians, and capacity building, for educators and other practitioners coming
into contact with children, in accordance with the public health model of combatingoﬄine child sexual abuse; technical measures, for example age veriﬁ cation, can help to
ensure children have access to age-appropriate online environments and content,where their risk of sexual contact with adults can be reduced; and therapeutic providerscan also assist children in reducing their vulnerability to victimisation.
Some of the functions have less obviously international dimensions than others. Thera-
peutic support will, for the most part, be delivered at national level, but capacity buildingfor practitioners in this ﬁeld may well be provided by or under the auspices of international
organisations. Delivery of technical prevention and disruption measures at scale almost
always has an international dimension, not least when they are deployed on global
online platforms.
The international dimension of responding to OCSE is most evident in the Criminal
Justice and Crisis Response functions, where government authorities in one countryrequire the timely assistance of entities in another. Two scenarios will serve to illustratethe character and pressing nature of the challenges.
Criminal justice
The victimisation of a child in Country A is reported to the local police. In accordance withthe WeProtect Global Alliance MNR, Country A has a national specialist law enforcementunit dedicated to the investigation of CSE. Initial investigation reveals that the child has
been encouraged to expose themselves online to an unknown person. In order to identify
this person, police in Country A need to request data pertaining to their registration on,and usage of, several online services. A typical scenario would be for a request to be
made to a social media provider for the subscriber and login information for anJOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY 7account. This most often includes registration data, phone and email identi ﬁers attached
to an account, and IP addresses for recent activity. If the provider is based in Country A and
the data is stored there, domestic legislation will su ﬃce to compel the production of the
information sought in a timely manner. This is typically the procedure for requests to local
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) for metadata concerning home internet usage. If,
however, the provider is located and the data stored in another country, the legislationof Country A has no extraterritorial force to compel the data ’s production. This has histori-
cally been the case for law enforcement agencies outside the US seeking data from large
US-based online providers. The process is further complicated where cloud storage may
hinder attempts by authorities to identify the location of data at a speci ﬁc time (Gillespie
2012a , 358f.).
The importance of communications data to OCSE investigations is re ﬂected in its
inclusion in the regularly updated model legislation and global review of instruments pro-duced by the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children (2016). Remedies
exist in the diplomatic sphere, most notably the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties
(MLAT) agreed between countries for bilateral assistance in criminal investigations. Butthe majority of these agreements were made before the mass adoption of internet tech-
nologies and the misuse of instant communication for serious crimes such as OCSE
(UNODC 2015 , 48). While some countries, such as the US, have exceptions that permit
emergency disclosure in circumstances indicating a threat to life or limb, on the whole,national legislations either do not provide for –or may strictly prohibit –direct disclosure
of personal data held in one country to government authorities in another.
14
Various initiatives are currently underway to modify individual agreements or inter-
national legislation. At the time of writing, the UK is seeking to conclude an agreement
with the US which will permit UK law enforcement authorities to request personal data
directly from US providers; the European Commission has announced plans for EuropeanProduction and Preservation Orders to enable member states to request data directly from
providers operating a service in fellow EU member states, and the recently enacted CLOUD
Act empowers federal US authorities to obtain data held by US companies on serversoutside the US.
15
Crisis response
The WeProtect MNR highlights the need for legislation that enables data to be requestedinternationally, including from third countries, but does not fully re ﬂect the complexity
inherent in that process, nor the speed at which OCSE can now be committed and become
life-threatening. Sexual extortion of children can rapidly progress from initial contact to
crisis. A child in Country A exposes themselves online at the request of an unknownperson. That unknown person threatens the child that they will publish the material receivedor recorded unless more (often more abusive) material is produced or monies are paid within a
short time, typically a couple of hours, a day at most. If the child has the courage to tell a parent
or guardian, this may be reported to the local police. In cases where the chief harm is causedby the publication of the CSAM, authorities may prioritise prevention and disruption over
identifying the o ﬀender. Country A has a national specialist OCSE unit as recommended by
the WeProtect MNR. The only identi ﬁers for the suspect relate to an account for a video
chat platform based in another country, Country B. The alleged victim is in crisis and hasexpressed suicidal thoughts. The most urgent priority is to locate the suspect account and8 V. BAINESremove the possibility for publication of the CSAM. Information will then be sought with the
aim of identifying and locating the suspect. If the suspect is located in a country other than
Country B, where possible, the information will be shared with authorities in that countryto assist in the suspect ’s apprehension and prevent further victimisation.
For authorities responding to OCSE, the above scenario is not uncommon. As will be
evident, there are several possible points of failure that could result in direct physical harmto the child. The child may not disclose but su ﬀer in silence; the parent/guardian may not
report to the police; local police may not understand the urgency of the situation; the
country may not have a specialist unit with key contacts in other countries and online provi-
ders; the online provider may not have the capacity or legal basis to respond to emergencyrequests from foreign authorities. Where disruption and harm reduction are successful, they
rely more on interpersonal relationships than on a tested or agreed process (UNODC 2015 ).
Practitioners and researchers alike have recognised the potential of sexual extortion for
psychological damage, self-harm and suicide.
16Crisis intervention has historically been
the remit of social workers and therapeutic providers and is a key feature of the increasingly
popular Barnahus inter-agency model for responding to child sexual exploitation andabuse.
17But in a hyperconnected world where children are encouraged to interface directly
with others on global technology platforms, ﬁrst responders may also be peers, parents,
helplines, hotlines, educators, law enforcement and online service providers –all of whose
actions may impact on the mental and physical wellbeing of a child in potential crisis. Thepublic health model requires a community response, and the internet-mediated public is
a global community. There is, therefore, an opportunity to establish an international and
multi-agency emergency response that reduces the immediate harm of OCSE for childrenin crisis, enabled by an agreed operational framework and resourced for rapid action.
It should be emphasised that crisis response is also necessary for OCSE o ﬀenders and
potential o ﬀenders. Individuals struggling to control, or come to terms with, their urges to
commit OCSE o ﬀences will often require urgent live support. Adequate resourcing for help-
lines is therefore essential to prevent harm to o ﬀenders, as well as reduce o ﬀending.
Why has a focus on crisis response largely been absent, to date, from strategies to combat
OCSE? A possible explanation lies in the fact that both legal measures and research have his-torically been focused primarily on CSAM and not on the full range of OCSE o ﬀences (Europol
2017b , 9). The requirement for criminalisation of non-image-based OCSE activities, such as
grooming, is a comparatively recent development. The Lanzarote Convention, enacted in2010, and the 2011 EU Directive on Combating the Sexual Abuse and Sexual Exploitation
of Children and Child Pornography, are the landmark international instruments in this
regard.
18In 2019, some signatory countries are yet to ratify the convention and fully transpose
the directive into their national legislations. Continued policy focus on technical measures for
eradicating CSAM is well founded, aimed as it is at reducing supply and revictimisation,
improving practitioner resilience and coordinating responses. But its emphasis on ﬁles,
rather than live scenarios involving children, has not kept pace with the changing methods
of victimisation. There is a further opportunity to recalibrate international responses to
ensure they meet the goal of protecting children (Phippen 2017).
Legislative measures alone cannot ensure a timely international response to OCSE
emergencies. Human capacity is required to maintain international relationships, not
only within national law enforcement authorities, but also in the companies receiving
emergency requests for assistance. The major US tech companies publish transparencyJOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY 9reports that include statistics on the number of data requests they receive from each coun-
try’s law enforcement agencies. These numbers do not necessarily include the number of
times a company is called upon to disrupt or prevent OCSE, or the time taken to build
relationships often with multiple law enforcement o ﬃcers in every country policing OCSE.
Recent recommendations by the European Commission that EU member states desig-
nate Single Points of Contact (SPOCs) for data requests to US providers will doubtless bewelcomed by online service providers, and this re ﬂects the identi ﬁed need for greater
coordination in international evidence gathering, including in relation to OCSE. This is
especially the case for smaller providers who may lack the capacity and resources to
assist global law enforcement to the extent of the large global technology companies.
19
Insight and analysis
The MNR identi ﬁes research, analysis and monitoring of child sexual exploitation and abuse
(CSEA) as a desired capability: ‘Action to prevent and tackle CSEA is intelligence and evi-
dence-led. The nationally-agreed view is used to inform the development, prioritisationand implementation of the country ’s CSEA response and related policy and practice ’.
20
The ability to review progress and adapt responses to changes in the operating environmentis no less important at international level, given the transnational nature of Online ChildSexual Exploitation. Just as the MNR highlights that legal de ﬁciencies in one country may
lead to crime displacement
21, so too do trends in victim and o ﬀender behaviours and
also good practice in protective measures need to be shared globally, and in a timelyfashion, to ensure consistent and e ﬀective responses across countries and sectors.
Advances in international research and analysis of trends in OCSE have, to date, been
sporadic and largely sector-speci ﬁc. Notable examples of international law enforcement
analysis of OCSE include the Virtual Global Taskforce (VGT) Environmental Scan, an assess-
ment of trends in OCSE based on the contributions of law enforcement specialists in VGT
member countries and organisations.
22First produced in 2008 for the World Congress III
Against the Sexual Exploitation of Children, it largely re ﬂects trends as observed in law
enforcement workloads and includes consideration of possible future developments,
demonstrating a level of foresight not required by the WeProtect MNR.23
In terms of international reach, the VGT assessments are perhaps the most representative, but
they are representative only of the VGT members hip (including EU member states via Europol).
They cannot be said to accurately re ﬂect African law enforcement ’se x p e r i e n c eo fO C S E ,f o r
instance, since no African country is a VGT m ember. Other research, such as Europol ’sInternet
Organised Crime Threat Assessment ,r eﬂects law enforcement ’s assessment of OCSE in a speci ﬁc
geographical region.24Further phenomenon- or capability-based analyses add to our under-
standing, including those of the various ﬁnancial coalitions on commercial OCSE, the US National
Center for Missing and Exploited Children on sexual extortion, the International Center for Missing
and Exploited Children on legislation, ECPAT International and Interpol on CSAM, and the Cana-
dian Centre for Child Protection ’sInternational Survivor ’s Survey.25What has been lacking is analy-
sis that synthesises these ﬁndings into a global assessment, with regular updates.
There is therefore an opportunity for a truly international and multi-stakeholder assessment
of OCSE that enables all countries and sectors to anticipate risks and threats on a regular basis.
In this respect, research and analysis has an important role to play, not only in reporting andlearning, but also in the primary and secondary prevention of OCSE. This is no small undertak-
ing given the number of countries to be surveyed –Interpol member countries alone number10 V. BAINES192. The MNR ’s recommendation for national research and analysis capabilities would
perhaps go some way to ﬁlling these gaps and generating the necessary data, if all 82 WePro-
tect Global Alliance countries were to commit to their establishment. As recent strides in the
coordination of victim identi ﬁcation illustrate, technology can assist the international coordi-
nation of the ﬁght against OCSE. Just as Interpol ’s International Child Sexual Exploitation (ICSE)
database now enables investigators, hotline analysts and other authorities to focus on uniden-tiﬁed children by ﬂagging material already investigated by the international law enforcement
community, so too can technological tools automate at least part of the process of data gath-
ering and qualitative and quantitative intelligence analysis.
The WeProtect ( 2018 ) Global Threat Assessment is the most recent move towards ﬁlling
this analytical gap. Furthermore, it highlights the need for ‘consistent global assessment of
the threat from CSEA and its impact ’and to ‘keep up with the changing nature of such a
diverse, complex and fast-moving threat ’.
26Beyond general reporting of projected smart-
phone adoption, however, its foresight is currently limited.27
Cross-cutting challenges and enablers
A number of prerequisites underpin the delivery of the optimal international response to
OCSE mapped in Figure 2.
International coordination
International coordination is perhaps the most prominent theme of this research. Theabove discussion of crisis response highlights the need for fast-time international and
multi-stakeholder coordination. At an investigative level, international coordination
ensures essential information exchange and evidence gathering, often despite legalobstacles. It also streamlines operational activity, minimising duplication of e ﬀort and
avoiding cross-contamination by multiple law enforcement authorities. At the strategic
level, international coordination can target capacity building where it is most needed
(Gillespie 2012a , 359) and enable both measurement of impact and sharing of valuable
insights. The problematics of international coordination relate to ownership and leader-
ship. When it comes to OCSE, national sovereignty is not the only challenge. As UNICEF
(2011 ) notes, ‘The borderless nature of the Internet makes it hard for both national govern-
ments and inter-governmental agencies to speak directly to what has now become a
highly di ﬀuse and widely dispersed set of interests ’.
Legislation
Legislation is required speci ﬁcally at international level to ensure approximation or harmoni-
sation of criminal o ﬀences; a common understanding on jurisdiction and extraterritoriality;
and to provide for evidence gathering and information exchange, amongst other aims.28
As discussed above, legislation can itself pose a challenge in urgent situations where swiftinternational responses are required. At a strategic level, instruments such as the United
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Lanzarote Convention, the 2011 EU Direc-tive and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child set international standards
in this regard to which communities and advocacy groups can hold governments to account.JOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY 11A presumption of partnership
Mapping functions rather than stakeholders has revealed that the majority of the
optimal international response activiti es rely on the contribution of more than one
stakeholder, and, in some cases, several. For example, while criminal investigation isthe natural preserve of law enforcement , feedback contributors noted that non-
governmental organisations, including hotlines for illegal material, child helplines andﬁeld missions, play an active role in identifying o ﬀenders and victims. Accurate analysis
of victim and o ﬀender behaviours will necessarily requ ire the sharing of information and
intelligence between governments, industry and non-governmental organisations. In acrisis response scenario involving the publication of CSAM, law enforcement, platformproviders, hotlines and helplines may all be active in removing the immediate harm
to a child. As Figure 3 illustrates, the international st akeholder environment for OCSE
is complex.
In full recognition of the challenges of ownership at international level, UNICEF ( 2011 )
has called for ‘a collective e ﬀort by policymakers, law enforcement agencies, social
workers, teachers, parents and the private sector to systematically protect children ’.
Until now, the public discourse in relation to OCSE has often characterised this collective
eﬀort as a series of one-way relationships. As Phippen ( 2017 ) observes, the dominant
policy response in some countries has been to look to technology to solve a societalproblem. This is echoed in media coverage of the relationship between some governmentauthorities and online platform providers, where the tone is more often punitive than
collaborative.
29
The question of progressing OCSE stakeholder relationships from cooperation to part-
nership is not merely semantic. Cooperation, as outlined in the MNR and currently prac-tised by stakeholders in the ﬁght against OCSE, is predominantly transactional: for
example, industry or hotlines reporting illegal material to law enforcement, law enforce-
ment asking industry for data or to remove material, non-governmental organisationsreporting intelligence in the ﬁeld to the relevant parties. Cooperation gives every stake-
holder a role, but not necessarily an equal voice. True partnership in the ﬁght against
OCSE, in which all stakeholders have a part to play in shaping the response –not just in
delivering it –would arguably engender not only greater ownership and investment
from individual stakeholders, but also more innovative solutions in the interests of protect-ing children and controlling o ﬀending. The involvement of all stakeholders is also in the
spirit of the public health model for crime prevention. To this end, following a survey of
practitioners in multiple sectors, Davidson et al. have identi ﬁed the need for ‘a real
joined up partnership ’between law enforcement and industry that is ‘visible, functional,
eﬀective and seen as legitimate ’, and ‘the development of systematic policing and industry
collaboration ’.
30
Communities and constituents
To the stakeholders identi ﬁed as professional contributors to the ﬁght against OCSE must
be added also the ‘targets ’of these responses. Smallbone, Marshall, and Wortley ( 2008 )
identify four ‘essential targets for preventing child sexual abuse: victims or potential
victims; o ﬀenders or potential o ﬀenders; situations in which sexual abuse has occurred
or is likely to occur, and communities ’.12 V. BAINESFigure 3. Select stakeholder groups in the ﬁght against online child sexual exploitation. Note: this map is not exhaustive and is intended to serve solely as an illustration of the
complexity of the stakeholder environment. Omission or inclusion on the map should not be interpreted as indicative of any weight or value of contribu tion.JOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY 13Article 3.1 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child requires that ‘In all actions
concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions,
courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of thechild shall be a primary consideration. ’Accordingly, UNICEF ( 2011 ) advocates for a
child-centred approach to online child protection, and there have been numerous callsfor law enforcement and criminal justice responses that are child-friendly.
31Asﬁndings
of the EU Kids Online project have consistently demonstrated, asking children whatbothers or upsets them online reveals diversity in how children feelabout OCSE-related
experience in di ﬀerent countries and socio-demographic contexts, often challenging par-
ental and policymakers ’perceptions of the problem (Livingstone et al. [ 2011 ], [2012 ],
[2014 ]).
Support services for children and child participation in the development of policy and
practice are key features of the MNR. Not so evident in the models to date are the voices ofoﬀenders and potential o ﬀenders. Approaching OCSE as a public health problem, rather
than a problem of public order, requires listening to o ﬀenders and potential o ﬀenders –
what works, what does not, their particular challenges and methods –in order to
develop preventative measures that are e ﬀective because they are representative.
To date, public discourse has shown itself to be intolerant, if not hostile, to OCSE o ﬀenders
and potential o ﬀenders. This is understandable, but potentially counterproductive to the
goals of protecting children and controlling o ﬀending, and has in turn made such support ser-
vices as there are even more essential for the health and wellbeing of o ﬀenders and potential
oﬀenders. Altering the public discourse in relation to o ﬀenders generally would seem to be
important, but particularly so in respect of juvenile o ﬀending and its prevention where
there is a recognised knowledge gap.
32Acknowledgment of the intersection between
target groups, namely that a child can also be an o ﬀender, should lead stakeholders to ques-
tion further the mainstream media ’s insistence on the demonisation of o ﬀenders.
Technology
Technical solutions play a role in several components of the optimal international
response to OCSE and are already used by several stakeholders including law enforce-
ment, platform providers and hotlines for illegal content (NetClean 2018 ; UNODC 2015 ).
To date they have been deployed most extensively in the processes of detecting and
removing CSAM, and in the investigation of OCSE by law enforcement authorities,
where they assist in the prioritisation of cases and victim identi ﬁcation.
Hashing of known Child Sexual Abuse Material with a unique signature for each image
has enabled platforms to automatically identify and report attempted uploads. This hasbeen seen as an important step forward for companies willing to demonstrate due dili-gence, with the added bene ﬁt that such measures aim to minimise revictimisation of chil-
dren and young people by reducing the ongoing circulation of identi ﬁed material. The
practice is largely adopted by US companies, in line with a national statutory reportingobligation. Hash sharing and related technologies also improve personnel resilience, inindustry, law enforcement and hotlines, by reducing the amount of material that needs
to be manually reviewed.
Given the identi ﬁcation above of gaps in relation to international crisis response, insight
and analysis, and timely evidence gathering across jurisdictions, it is reasonable to suggestthat automation of some tasks may improve responses in these areas.14 V. BAINESPolitical will
The international response to OCSE relies on adequate funding by nation states. Without it,
individual countries risk becoming hotspots in the production and distribution of CSAM –
be this by live streaming, online solicitation or other means, as a location for suspects,victims or both. A number of countries around the world could already be said to be in
this situation due to lack of resources. Their lack of response in turn weakens the inter-
national community ’s ability to combat the problem, creating a perception of ‘safe
havens ’and additional victims and suspects in other countries.
Support from international organisations in the form of ad hoc training or donated
equipment can only ever be a small part of a country ’s response to the problem. This is
a key message of the MNR: establishment of the desired functions outlined for signatory
countries necessarily entails the provision of funding for national specialist law enforce-
ment units, hotlines/helplines and so forth. Logic suggests that political will shouldresult in the allocation of resources, but in the ﬁeld of OCSE, the relationship appears to
be more complex. There is currently no publicly available information on the progressof signatory countries towards implementing the WeProtect commitments. It is evident,however, that many signatory countries have made no obvious progress towards theestablishment of specialist law enforcement units, youth awareness campaigns or thera-
peutic support for victims and o ﬀenders.
Whether their basis is political, charitable or focused on enforcement, international
organisations have a role to play in lobbying for change, political will and increasedresources. This in turn can enhance coordination and reduce duplication of e ﬀort, again
ensuring that resources are distributed where they are most needed.
Concluding remarks
OCSE is a complex and dynamic phenomenon. The optimal international response pro-
posed in this article and the subsequent discussion cannot hope to cover all aspects ofthe topic in the detail they deserve, nor was this the intention of the research. Rather, it
is anticipated that the relevant stakeholders will take forward the various items worthy
of further consideration.
In deliberately choosing to map the gold standard for combating OCSE in all its forms at
international level, the research highlights opportunities for improvement in all countries.Based on assessment of the current state of o ﬀending and victimisation and contributions
from stakeholders, it is reasonable to assume that no one country would boast su ﬃcient
law enforcement resources or ongoing therapeutic support for o ﬀenders and victims.
From the international perspective, the most obvious gaps to be transformed into
opportunities are in:
.Establishment of a procedure for fast-time response to OCSE events in which childrenand young people experience crisis;
.Streamlined cooperation and information exchange in the realm of criminal justice; and
.Regular insight and analysis that ‘future proofs ’OCSE responses as far as possible.
In terms of a general global strategy, the author has asserted that greater international
coordination and true partnership across stakeholder groups have the power to createJOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY 15more e ﬀective and innovative countermeasures whose secondary impacts are foreseen.
Mapping of currently observed and emerging OCSE activities in particular has cast light
on interdependencies between them. These in turn suggest that an optimal internationalresponse is one that approaches OCSE holistically, rather than focusing on a single aspect
or activity, and as both a crime problem and a public health issue.
The author is duty bound to acknowledge that the discussion in this article is inevitably
coloured by her own professional experience combating and analysing OCSE in law enfor-
cement and industry and working closely with non-governmental organisations. Every
attempt has been made to ensure that the perspectives of all relevant stakeholder
groups were included in the research, not least by soliciting feedback on the optimal inter-national response. It is hoped that this article will prompt further stakeholder and public
debate on how OCSE is tackled globally.

Notes
1. Throughout this article, and in this section in particular, attention has been paid to the termi-
nology used to describe activities deemed to be Online Child Sexual Exploitation. Reference
has been made to the terminology guidelines produced by ECPAT Luxembourg/ECPAT Inter-national ( 2016 ), to ensure the use of appropriate and recognised terminology wherever
possible.
2. Those seeking to consign ‘child pornography ’to obsolescence quite rightly draw attention to
the implication of consent in the use of the term ‘pornography ’, which does not accurately
reﬂect the status of the material in question as a record of a sexual assault.
