 Abstract  
Background : Excessive digital media use is prevalent and has a negative impact on sleep, 
daytime functioning, and mental health in adolescents. We examine d the prospective 
associations  between digital media use and subsequent suicidal and non -suicidal self -harm . 
Methods:  Shandong Adolescent B ehavior & Health Cohort  (SABHC)  is a longitudinal study of 
adolescent behavior and health in Shandong, China . Participants included for the analysis were 
7,072  SABHC adolescents  who were initially assessed in 2015 and were reassessed in 2016. A  
self-administered structured questionnaire was used to measure digital media use  (i.e., television 
watching, internet use, and mobile phone use ) on weekdays and at the weekend , mental heal th, 
and self -harm.   
Results : Multi variable  logistic regression analyses s howed that daily internet use ≥ 2 hours on 
weekdays ( odd ratio ( OR)=1.86, 95%  confidence interval (CI)=1.25 -2.76)  and ≥3 hours at the 
weekend (OR= 1.46, 95%CI =1.06 -2.00) and daily mobile phone use 2-4 hours at the weekend 
(OR=1.46, 95%CI =1.02 -2.10) were associated with increased risk of recurrent self -harm . Daily 
internet use ≥ 2 hours on weekdays (OR=1.81, 95%CI=1.20 -2.74) and ≥3 hours at the weekend 
(OR=1.55, 95%CI=1.12 -2.15), daily mobile phone use 1 -2 hours on weekdays (OR=1.47, 
95%CI =1.02 -2.12) and ≥4 hours at the weekend (OR=1.93, 95%CI =1.31 -2.85) were  associated 
with increased risk of recurrent non-suicidal self -injury .  
Limitations:  All data were  self-reported  and had no information about  digital media 
consumption.   
Conclusions : Excessive use of internet or mobile phone appears to be a significant risk factor of 
self-harm , suggesting that  limiting adolescent use of internet and mobile phone may be beneficial 
to reduce risk of self -harm.

 1. Introduction  
Self-harm refers to intentional self -poisoning or self -injury, irrespective of type of motive 
or the extent of suicidal intent  (Hawton et al.,  2003 ), including suicide  attempt  and non-suicidal 
self-injury  (NSSI) . Self-harm among you th is prevalent , with  2% to 15% of adolescents having 
attempted suicide or afflicted self-harm (Hawton et al, 2012, Kann  et al., 2016, Liu et al., 201 9). 
Although most self-harms  are low in lethality, they are associated with clinical and functional 
impairment s and are a significant predictor of future s elf-harm and suicide  (Gould  et al., 2003 , 
Hawton et al., 2012) . It is therefore essential to identify modifiable risk factors  to develop 
effective intervention programs for youth self -harm prevention.  
In the modern society, digital media transmitted over the internet, computer network , 
mobile/ smart phone, tablet , and /or television ( TV) has become an essential source f or 
communication, socialization and education. Internet use in the world has increased considerably 
over the past few decades , especially among youth  (Kaess  et al., 2014) . According to Per 
Research Center, 92% of teens in the U.S. report going  online daily - including 24% who say 
they go online ―almost constantly ‖ (Lenhart  et al., 2010) . Digital media use has a mixed effect on 
pediatric population ’s well -being, with evidence of increased self -esteem and perceived social 
support alongside harmful effects such as increased exposure to graphic content, cyber -bullying, 
and risk of developing online addictive behaviors  (Best et al., 2014 ; Kaess  et al., 2014, Tonioni  
et al., 2012) . Excessive digital media use may have a detrimental impact on adolescents’ 
psychosocial development  and mental health  (Kaess  et al., 2014) , school performance (Liu et al., 
2020), sleep disturbances, and multiple risk -taking behaviors such as disordered eating  and 
substance abuse  (Levenson  et al., 2016, Park et al., 2018) . High profile cases of cyber -bullying 
and suicide over the past decade (L ester et al., 2013) and reports of suicide clusters facilitated by 
         
         8 
 social media ( Robertson et al., 2012)  have caused an increas ed attention to  better understand  the 
association  between internet use and self -harm /suicide.  
Recent studies have demonstrated significant associations between pathological internet 
use or i nternet addition and self -injury (Lam et al., 2009)  and suicidal behaviors  (Kaess  et al., 
2014, Lin et al., 2014, Marchant  et al., 2017) . It has also been reported that rates of internet use 
were higher among adolescents who self -harm than their peers  who d o not use the internet as 
much  (Daine  et al., 2013) . A study examined the social dynamics surrounding media reporting 
on suicide in a suicide -prone community  (Poplar Grove, USA)  with an enduring adolescent 
suicide  problem  and found that suicide deaths that were covered by digital media triggered 
significant  cognitive dissonance , which may generate opportunities  for peer role modeling of 
suicide  (Mueller , 2017) . Celebrity suicides that generate a large reaction from users on Twitter 
can also increase suicide r isk (Ueda , 2017).  
These findings  suggest that  excessive digital media use may be a significant risk factor of 
self-harm . A recent review  of the association between  social media, internet us e, and suicide 
attempts in adolescent  includes  nine cross -sectional studies published between 2012 and 2018 , 
and concludes  an independent association between problem atic use of social media/internet and 
suicide attempts in young people ( Sedgwick  et al., 2019).  However, to our best knowledge, most 
previous studies are cross -sectional  so that the direction of causality, if any, remains unclear , as 
such further evaluation through longitudinal studies is warranted ; and they have  been focused on 
pathological internet use or internet addiction  (Lam et al., 2009, Liu et al., 2017, Park et al., 
2013) , and their findings are not consisten t. To address th ese limitations , we conducted a 
longitudinal study w ith a large community sample of adolescents in China (n=7,072)  to examine  
the prospective association  between digital media use (television watching, internet use, and 
         
         9 
 mobile phone use ) and subsequent self-harm, including  suicid e attempt  and NSSI over a 1-year 
follow -up. 
 
2. Method  
2.1. Parti cipants and procedure  
Shandong Adolescent Behavior & Health Cohort (SABHC) is a  longitudinal study of 
adolescent behavior and health in Shandong, China. A total of 11,83 1 adolescent students 
participated in SABHC baseline survey . Detailed sampling and data collection have been  
published  elsewhere  (Liu et al., 2018 ; Liu et al., 2019 ). In brief, participants were sampled from 
5 middle and 3 high schools  in 3 counties of Shan dong  province , with consideration s of 
representativeness of the schools across the counties , prior study collaboration, convenience, and 
budget for at least 3 waves of data collection. The study was approved by the research ethics 
committee of School of Public Health at Shandong University , China . We obtained permission to 
conduct the study from all the target schools  and informed consent from participants before 
baseline survey.  
Figure 1 shows SABHC study flow chart. The b aseline survey was conducted amongst  7-
11th graders in Nov ember -December  of 2015  (n=11,831 ) (Liu et al, 2017, Liu et al., 2018 , Liu et 
al., 2019 ). A self-administered, structured adolescent health questionnaire (AHQ)  was used to  
assess suicid e attempt , NSSI, mental health, digital media use, and psychosocial factors  (Chen  et 
al., 2017, Liu, 2004, Liu and Tein, 2005, Liu et al., 2008). Trained public health workers  or 
master  public health  students administered AHQ to participants in their classrooms during 
regular school hours. Before filling out the questionnaire, participants were instructed to read the 
instructions carefully and were informed that the survey was anonymous, their responses were 
         
         10 
 blind to teachers , and their participation was voluntary without any penalties for nonparticipation.  
It took about 45minutes to complete the survey. All 9th and 11th graders were not followed up 
(n=3,202) because they were preparing for high school and college entrance exams, respectively.  
According to our study design, 7th, 8th, and 10th graders at baseline (n = 8,629) were resurveyed 
one year later in 2016. The final analysis included 7,072 participants who were initially assessed 
in 2015 and were reassessed in 2016.   
 
2.2. Measures  
2.2.1 Self-harm  
Self-harm was assessed using questions about suicide attempt and NSSI. Suicide attempt 
was measured with the question: ―Have you ever tried to kill yourself  in your whole life ?‖ for 
lifetime suicide attempt and ―Did you try to kill yourself  during the past year ?‖ for last -year 
suicide attempt. NSSI was measured with the question: ―Have you ever tried to hurt yourself 
deliberately without intention to kill yourself in your whole life? ‖ for lifetime NSSI and ―Did 
you ever try to hurt yourself deliberately without intention to kill yourself during the past year?‖ 
for last -year NSSI. If a respondent answered ―yes‖ on the question, he or she was considered to 
have the behavior. These questions have been used in our studie s to assess suicidal behav ior and 
NSSI  in Chinese adolescents  (Liu, 2004, Liu et al., 2017).  
  
         
         11 
  
 
2.2.2 Digital media use  
Three types of digital media exposure at baseline were surveyed, including  TV watching, 
internet  use for entertainment or v ideo game playing, and mobile phone use.  Respondents were 
asked the number of  hours per day on weekdays and at the weekend that they had spent using 
each media in the past month , which should be very different in weekdays ( at school) and 
weekdays ( at home ) and may have diff erent effects on sleep  and mental health (Liu et al., 2019).  
The following questions were specifically asked :1)―On an average school day, how many hours 
do you watch TV? ‖, 2)―On an average school day, how many hours do you use the internet  for 
entertainment or video game  playing ?‖, 3)―On an average school day, how many hou rs do you 
use mobile /smart  phone? ‖, 4) ―On an average weekend day, how many hou rs do you watch 
TV?‖, 5) ―On an average weekend day, how many hours do you use the i nternet  for 
entertainment or video game playing ?‖, and 6) ―On an average weekend day, how many  hours 
do you use mobile /smart  phone?‖.  
 
2.2.3 Covariates  
The following covariates were selected in the current study based on  literature  (Hawton 
et al., 2012, Kaess et al., 2014, Liu and Buysse , 2006, Liu et al., 2019) and/or if p-values were 
less than 0.2 in the univariate analysis  for the a ssociation between  digital media use and self -
harm  (Lauw et al., 2018) .  
Anxio us/depressive symptoms. The Chinese Youth Self -Report (YSR)  of Achenbach’s 
Child Behavior Checklist was  used to measure anxious/depressive symptoms  (Achenbach , 1991, 
         
         12 
 Liu et al., 1997) . The YSR anxious/depressed subscale consists of 16 items that are rated on a 3 -
point scale: ―0‖ = not true, ―1‖  = somewhat or sometimes true, and ―2‖ = very true or often true. 
The Cronbach alpha  with the present sample was 0.8 8 for the subscale. For the  present  study, 2 
items concerning s elf-harm were dropped when calculating the subscale  score . 
Impulsiveness . The Eysenck I7 impulsiveness scale was used to assess adolescent’s 
impulsivity  (Eysenck  et al., 1984) . The scale is composed of 19 items with a modified response 
format from 1 = never or rarely , 2 = sometimes, 3 = often, to 4 = always. Example items are ―Do 
you often get into trouble because you do things without thinking?‖ and ―Are you an impulsive 
person?‖ The Cronbach alpha was 0.92 with the current sample.  
Other a dolescent covariates  were age, gender , chronic disease, insomnia symptoms, 
cigarette  smoking , and alcohol  use. 
Family factors included father  education  (primary school, middle school, high school, 
professional school, or college or above) , family history of suicide or attempt, self-reported 
family economic status  (excellent, good, fair, poor, or very poor) , and interparental relationship  
(excellent , good, fair, poor, or separated/divorced /died ). 
 
2.3. Statistical analysis  
Based on the history of self-harm at baseline and at 1-year follow -up, participants were 
categorized into 4 groups: never self -harm, baseline self -harm only, recurrent self -harm, and new 
self-harm. Chi-square tests were used to examine the differences in self -harm across digital 
media use (TV, internet , and mobile phone) on weekdays and at the weekend. Univariate and 
multi ple logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the associations between 
individual media use on weekdays and at the weekend and recurrent self -harm and new self -
         
         13 
 harm, respec tively. In the multivaria ble models, covariates were adolescent factors 
(anxious/depressive symptoms, impulsiveness, age, gender, chronic disease, insomnia symptoms, 
cigarette smoking, and alcohol use) and family factors (father education, family history o f 
suicide or attempt, self -reported family economic status and inter -parental relationship).   Primary 
statistical analyses were performed f or self-harm . Secondary analyses were performed for suicide 
attempt and NSSI, respectively . All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 
Statistics for Windows, Version 2 2.0 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp) .  
 
3. Results  
3.1. Sample characteristics  
Of the 8,629 7th-8th graders and 10th graders  who participated in the baseline survey, 
7,072 (82.0%)  were re survey ed at the 1-year follow -up and were included for the analysis . The 
primary reason for loss to follow -up was that some participants  went to different classes/schools.  
However, b aseline adolescent and family demographic characteristics (including age, gender , 
smoking, drinking, family history of suicid e, father ’s education  and occupation, and family 
economic status ) were similar between participants who were re survey ed and those who were 
expected to be re survey ed (all P> .05) . Of the 7,072 participants, mean age was 14.59 years (SD 
= 1.45) at baseline and half were males.  Table 1 presents detailed sample characteristics at 
baseline.  
 
3.2. Digital media use in Chinese adolescents  
On weekdays, the mean time of digital media use at baseline was 0.45 hours (27 min) /day 
for watching TV, 0.38 hours (23 min) for internet use, and 0.50 hours (30 min) for mobile phone 
         
         14 
 use, respectively. At the weekend, the time of digital media use at baseline substantially 
increased: 2.6 hours (156 min) /day for watching TV, 2.1 hours (126 min) for internet use, and 
2.6 hours (156 min) for mobile phone use. In other words, 20% watch ed TV, 17% used i nternet, 
and used mobile phone  for at least 1 hour /day on weekdays; 64% watch ed TV, 48% used internet, 
and 52% used mobile at least 2 hours/day at the weekend  (Table 1) . 
 
3.3. Self-harm at 1 -year follow -up 
At 1-year follow -up, 10.2% participants engaged in self -harm , with 4.2% for new self -
harm and 6.0% for recurrent self -harm . As shown in Figure 2, the incidence  rates  of new NSSI 
and suicide attempt w ere 3.5% and 2.1%, respectively; and the incidence  rates  of recurrent NSSI 
and suicide attempt w ere 5.2% and 0.6%, respectively.  
 
3.4. Associations between digital media use and self -harm  
Table 2 shows baseline digital media use on weekdays and at the weekend by self-harm. 
On weekday s, internet use and mobile phone use were positively  associated with self -harm (both 
P<0.001). At the weekend, watching TV, internet use, and mobile phone use were all positi vely 
associated with self -harm (all P<0.001).  
Table 3 shows crude and adjusted odds ratios of self-harm at 1-year follow -up associated 
with each digital media use. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that internet use ≥ 2 
hours/day on weekdays (OR=1.86, 95%CI=1.25 -2.76)  and ≥3 hours /day at the weekend (OR 
=1.46, 95%CI =1.06 -2.00), mobile phone use 2 -4 hours /day on weekends (OR =1.46, 95%CI 
=1.02 -2.10) and ≥4 hours/day  at the weekend (OR =1.74, 95%CI =1.20 -2.51) were significantly 
         
         15 
 associated with increased risk of recurrent self -harm after adjusting for adolescent and family 
covariates.   
For NSSI, baseline internet use ≥ 2 hours/day on weekdays (OR=1.81, 95%CI=1.20 -2.74)  
and ≥3 hours /day at the weekend (OR = 1.55, 95%CI =1.12 -2.15), mobile phone use 1 -2 
hours /day on weekdays (OR =1.47, 95%CI =1.02 -2.12) and 2 -4 hours /day (OR=1.49, 
95%CI=1.01 -2.19) and ≥4 hours/day  at the weekend (OR =1.93, 95%CI =1.31 -2.85) were 
significantly as sociated with increased risk of recurrent NSSI after adjusting for adolescent and 
family covariates (Table  4).   
For suicide attempt, baseline internet use 1 -2 hours/day on weekdays and 2-3 hours/day 
at the weekend were significantly associated with 1.8-fold increase in risk of new suicide attempt 
(OR = 1.80, 95%CI = 1.07 - 3.03) and an approximately  6-fold increase in risk of recurrent 
suicide attempt (OR = 6.26, 95%CI=1.31 -29.88), respectively.  
Watching TV at baseline was not independently associated with either subsequent NSSI 
or suicide attempt . 
 
4. Discussion  
To our knowledge, this is the first study to prospectively examine the association s 
between  digital media use and subsequent  self-harm in a large sample of Chinese adolescents. 
Our major findings are 1) internet use ≥ 2 hours/day on weekdays and ≥ 3 hours at the weekend 
were associated with an increase d risk of recurrent self -harm at 1-year follow -up after adjusting 
for adolescent and family covariates ; 2) mobile phone use ≥ 2 hours/day on weekends were 
associated with increased risk of recurrent self -harm; 3) f or suicide attempt, internet use ≥ 1 
         
         16 
 hours /day on weekdays and ≥ 2 hours/day at the weekend  were associated with increase d risks 
for new suicide attempt  and  recurrent suicide attempt , respectively . 
On average  in 2015,  American  8-12-year-olds spent  4 hours  36 minutes  per day on a 
screen  whilst  13-18-year-olds spent  6 hours  40 minutes  per day on a screen  (Rideout,  2015 ). 
According  to the Royal  College  of Paediatrics  and Child  Health  (2018),  children  and young  
people  from  the UK aged  11-24 years  old on average  spent  2.5 hours  on a computer/  laptop/  
tablet,  3 hours  on their phone , and 2 hours  watching  TV on a typical  day (Viner  and Firth,  2019 ). 
Compared  to Western  adolescents,  the averages  of minutes  of TV, internet  use, and mobile  
phone  use are lower in adolescents  in China , possibly  due to authoritarian  parenting,  health  
homework,  restriction  or limited  permit  of using  mobile  phone  at school  and at home .  
Despite relatively shorter time of digital media use in Chinese adolescents than Western 
peers, our findings support the positive association of self -harm/suicidal behavior with internet 
use, particularly with internet addiction, high levels of internet use, and websites with self -harm 
or suicide content  (Marchant  et al., 2017) . Although the mechanis m between digital media use 
and self -harm is not yet clear, there are several potential explanations. First, excessive digital 
media use and/or internet addiction are associated with mental health problems, such as 
depression, hostility, aggressive behaviors, and ADHD symptoms  (Ko et al., 2009, Lin et al., 
2016, Yen et al., 2007 , Liu et al., 2019 ), all of which can increase risk of self-harm  (Liu et al., 
2005, Liu et al., 201 9). Second, internet use or s ocial media  exposure may cause cyber -bullying  
or peer harassment , leading to depression , decreased self -worth, hopelessness, and loneliness —
all of which are precursors to suicidal behavio r (Hinduja  et al., 2010, John et al., 2018, O'Keeffe  
et al., 2011) . For example, a recent study of cyber -victimizat ion across seven European countries 
found that cyberbullying is linked to higher use of social network sites in adolescents aged 14 -17 
         
         17 
 years (Athanasiou  et al., 2018). In addition, the feeling of lack and dissatisfaction when scrolling 
through newsfeed often results from constant life/success comparisons, e.g., comparing 
individuals’ true reality to their peers idealized (e.g., perfectly Wechat or Instagr amed 
realities).These may result in having devastating consequences including self -harm.   
Third , sleep insufficiency and sleep disturbance have been demonstrated to be associated 
with self -harm  (Liu, 2004, Liu and Buysse, 2006, Liu et al., 2017).  Excessive digital media 
exposure may cause sleep loss and sleep and circadian rhythms disturbance s (Cain and Gradisar, 
2010, Chang et al., 2015, Higuchi et al., 2005).  Fourth , many adolescents may use the internet to 
look for information about sensitive top ics, such as mental health and behavioral problems, safe 
sexual practices, or contraception  and seek help online  (Collins et al., 2011 ; Srivastava et al., 
2018 ). For example, results suggest that there is a substantial amount of sexual content in teen 
chat rooms, both constructed  by teens (names, utterances) and present for teen users to be 
exposed to as observers . Internet sites and activities that resemble chats may include  discussions 
among participants in online video games, posted comments on YouTube, and comments on 
social networking sites  (Collins et al.,  2011) . Research  has shown  that having a sexual screen 
name or talking with peo ple known only online about sex  and using chat rooms were asso ciated 
with higher likelihood of self-harm (Mitchell and Ybarra, 2007).  The content  and veracity of 
information found online can be harmful ( such as information about pain/stress release via self -
harm and how to injure self or suicide)  (Belfort  et al., 2018) . Viewing images and reading 
information about self -harm in digital media can normalize self -harming behavior and 
discourage seeking professional help (Daine  et al., 2013) and lead to physical self -harm and 
suicidal ideation  (Patchin and Hinduja , 2017).  Fifth, recurrent self -harm or new suicide attempts 
can be prompted by viewing self-harm related stories in digital media  (Zahl and Hawton , 2004) .  
         
         18 
 Furthermore, excessive digital media use may cause fatigue and cognitive functioning 
impairment, poor judgement and impulsive behavior , all of which in turn can lead to suicidal and 
non-suicidal self -harm  (de Cates  et al., 2017, Liu et al., 2017).  Further research is warranted to 
examine the psychosocial pathways and biological mechanisms including mediators and 
moderators between digital media use and self -ham in adolescents.  
It is interesting to note that w atching TV was not independently associated with 
subsequent self -harm . This difference may be due to the inherent nature of watching TV  versus 
the use of  internet or smart phones. Watching TV does not require interacting with others, 
whereas using the internet and smart phon es does  (e.g., cyber  bullying,  constant  life/success  
comparisons) . On the other hand, TV programs may be more educational, entertain ing, enjoyable , 
and less violent and sexual  than contents in the internet or website.  
 
4.1 Clinical and public health implications  
In the technologically -driven digital era, the use of digital media will undoubtedly 
continue to rise. In the U .S., 84% of adults and 93% of teens ages 12 -17 have access to the 
Internet, and Facebook is currently the most commonly -used online social network  (Lenhart  et 
al., 2010, Perrin , 2015) . According to the 40th Statistical Report on Internet Development in 
China, the number of Chinese netize ns reached 751 million, mobile Internet users reached 721 
million, and the percentage of Internet surfing via mobile was as high as 96.3%  (CNNIC , 2017). 
Thus, mobile phone is not only used for phone call, but it is more likely used for internet and 
social communication. Although digital media can provide a wealth of information and resources 
that teens  can use to learn, socialize and communicate with peers and maintain their own health, 
digital media also has  a negative impact on teen’s psychosocial development and health  
         
         19 
 (O'Keeffe  et al., 2011).  Our study demonstrates that excessive digital media use w as associated 
with subsequent self -harm. Preventive strategies for self -harm and comprehensive intervention 
programs at school, family, clinical practice, and society levels are warranted. Intervention 
programs should be designed to prevent excessive digit al media use and internet addiction and to 
educate adolescents to avoid unhealthy, violent and sexual information when surfing the internet 
to improve adolescents’ mental health and reduce risk of self -harm. In the pediatric/adolescent 
medicine practice se tting, clinicians should engage in assessment and discussion about internet 
use, especially for adolescents who have engaged in suicidal and non -suicidal self -harm or have 
mental health issues  (Marchant  et al., 2017) . 
 
4.2. Strengths  and limitations  
This study has several strengths. First, this is a longitudinal study to examine the 
prospective association s between digital media use and self-harm  in a large sample of 
adolescents. Second, participants were  sampled from multiple counties and schools (n=8 ) to be 
representative of adolescent student s in the region. Third, the response rate of 82% was 
acceptably high. Fourth, weekday and weekend use of digital media was examined , separately. 
Fifth, multiple adolescent and family variables were statistically controlled for when examining 
the association s between digital media use and self -harm . Furthermore, it is particular ly 
important to examine suicide attempt and NSSI , respectively . 
Despite the strengths of the study, t hese findings need to be interpreted with considering 
the following limitations . First, all data were collected by self -report, which may have led to 
biased reporting of self-harm and digital media use. However, given that many individuals who 
have suicid e attempt s or self -injury may never seek medical help or result in hospitalization, self -
         
         20 
 report ed measures remain a valuable source of information about s elf-harm  (Hawton  et al., 2002, 
Owens  et al., 2015).  Objective measures of digital media use or diary are desirable, but self -
reports remain as the  typical method  in large -scale epidemiologic al studies . Second , data on the 
content of digital media consumption  were not collected . It is not possible to distinguish the 
effects of the contents , such as  cyberbullying, sexting, and self-injury encouraging  that may lead 
to self -harm. Third, internet addiction or pathological internet use is prevalent and is associated 
with mental health problems and suicidal behavior  in adolescents  (Lin et al., 2014, Marchant  et 
al., 2017, Tonioni  et al., 2012).  Although excessive digital media use is a symptom of internet 
addiction, the impact of excessive digital media use and internet addiction on mental health and 
self-harm may be different.  Fourth, although this sample is large , it may not be powerful enough 
for examining the association between digital media use and suicide attempt because the 
incidence of suicide attempt was low. 
 
4.3. Conclusions  
            Excessive use of internet or mobile phone appears to be a significant risk factor of self -
harm. Our study suggests that  limiting adolescent use of internet and mobile phone may be 
beneficial to reduce risk of self -harm.
