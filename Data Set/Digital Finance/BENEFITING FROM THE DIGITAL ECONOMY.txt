Cambodia Policy Note
July 2018
Cambodia Policy Note  | 4
Thanks to rapid and sustained growth, Cambodia has become one of the world’s leaders in poverty reduction and 
shared prosperity. Cambodia’s success so far has ridden on openness to trade and investment, preferential trade 
treatment, and an abundance of low-skilled, low-cost labor. This facilitated the establishment of an export-oriented 
and foreign-owned garment sector, which—together with tourism, agriculture, and construction—has been driving 
growth over the past two decades.
Several factors suggest that Cambodia will not be able to rely on its current drivers of growth going forward. With the 
country becoming more prosperous, it is receiving less generous donor financing, and preferential trade treatment 
is expected to phase out eventually. At the same time, rising wages are making it increasingly difficult for Cambodia 
to keep exporting unprocessed rice and low-end garments. Meanwhile, around the globe, automation is displacing jobs, and digital technologies are transforming certain sectors. Coinciding with the possibility of diminished economic 
prospects are the rising expectations of Cambodian citizens, fueled by the rapid spread of information through 
mobile phones, the internet, and social media.
In light of these factors, Cambodia’s current drivers of growth need to be diversified. While the country’s economic 
outlook remains positive, Cambodia could begin to explore new drivers of growth that will create jobs and boost 
prosperity over the next 20 years. The country’s next economic transformation will rest on its ability to empower 
domestic entrepreneurs and citizens with capabilities and tools for the modern economy of tomorrow. 
Drawing from the knowledge gaps identified in the Cambodia Systematic Country Diagnostic, the Cambodia 
Policy Notes assess four relatively under-analyzed policy areas: Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Digital Economy, 
Microfinance and Household Welfare, and Social Assistance. These topics are interrelated and will be crucial for 
catalyzing or complementing reforms in traditional sectors. For example, digital platforms are expected to play a 
key role in enabling local entrepreneurs to participate in global value chains more effectively. Financial technology 
(fintech) can provide expanded access to finance for both enterprises and individuals as well as facilitate the growth 
of e-commerce. Social assistance could help mitigate shocks for households and contribute to building a stronger 
human capital base to take advantage of new opportunities and safeguard the impressive economic gains of the 
last two decades.

Key Messages Digital Economy  | 7
Introduction
Following	 two	decades	 of	stellar	growth	 and	
poverty	 reduction,	 Cambodia’s	 next	wave	of	growth	
is	expected	 to	come	from	increasing	 value	added	
as well as nurturing new sectors such as the digital 
economy. Over the past two decades, facilitated by 
preferential trade treatment and strong foreign direct 
investment inflows, growth and job creation have taken 
place in activities with relatively limited value added, 
such as garment manufacturing, rice cropping, and 
construction. Now as a lower-middle income economy and in the context of rapidly increasing wages against 
stagnant productivity and rising external competition, 
Cambodia will need to develop new sources of growth. 
In particular, technological adoption by economic actors 
could play a critical role in boosting productivity and 
diversifying the economy. 
In	recent	years,	the	Cambodian	 authorities	 have	
issued	several	policy	documents	 related	to	digital	
development.	 Overall, the objectives and high-level 
program goals are generally consistent with international 
good practice and envisage partnerships between the 
Government and private sector at multiple levels. The 
Rectangular Strategy Phase III 2013-2018 highlights the 
need to further develop e-Government and encourage 
the private sector to invest in technology. This was 
followed in 2014 by the approval of the Cambodia ICT 
Master Plan 2020—which aims to improve ICT industry and human resources development, internet connectivity, 
cybersecurity, and government e-services—and in 
2016 by the Telecoms and ICT Policy—which outlines 
policy measures and associated targets to expand 
ICT infrastructure and develop ICT human capacity. 
In addition, the Cambodia e-Government Master Plan 
2017-2022 has been drafted, although not yet adopted. 
The draft outlines programs to provide quality information 
and digital services, in collaboration with prospective beneficiaries; connect with people on public policies 
1  World Bank Group, 2016.and decisions, in particular through social media; and increase government efficiency by establishing 
basic foundations for digital government (e.g., cloud, 
enterprise architecture, intensive staff capacity building) 
and a government portal on which ministries can host 
their services. 
Numerous	 institutions	 across	 the	Government	
are	tasked	 with	implementing	 these	policies	
and strategies. These agencies include: Ministry 
of Economy and Finance (MEF), Ministry of Post and 
Telecommunications (MPTC), Ministry of Commerce 
(MOC), Ministry of Information (MOI), and Council for the 
Development of Cambodia (CDC). A working committee 
on Digital Economy has also been established. While 
digital development is identified as a Government 
priority, an important next step would be a systematic 
assessment of potential economic and social benefits, 
review of the status of the measures proposed in these plans, and evaluation of any impacts they may have had 
to date.  
This	policy	note	responds	 to	a	request	 from	the	
Royal	Government	 of	Cambodia	 for	the	World	
Bank	to	assess	the	current	 state	of	Cambodia’s	
digital	economy	 and	identify	 policies	 to	develop	 it	
further. Firms and individuals need to prepare to face 
technological disruptions such as robotization, which are likely to affect the nature of production processes 
and jobs, even as they open new opportunities 
and markets. This policy note applies the analytical 
framework presented in the World Bank’s World 
Development Report 2016: Digital Dividends to identify 
challenges and suitable policy options, and it is intended 
to inform the preparation of the upcoming Rectangular 
Strategy Phase IV (2018-2023).

Context and Main 
Challenges 
Cambodia has made substantial progress in delivery of basic digital infrastructure, but provision of next-generation services is limited
Cambodians	 have	embraced	 mobile	technologies,	
with	a	dramatic	 increase	 in	subscriptions	 over	the	
past decade. With very little infrastructure remaining 
after the civil conflict, Cambodia bypassed rebuilding the fixed-line market and quickly launched into alternative 
technologies, jumpstarting its telecommunications 
infrastructure with mobile phones. Mobile cellular 
subscriptions in Cambodia increased from less than 10 
per 100 inhabitants in 2005 to 125 as of 2016, above the 
ASEAN average (Figure 1, left panel), although less than 
half of the subscriptions are estimated to be currently 
active. In contrast, fixed-broadband subscriptions, at 
0.6 per 100 inhabitants in 2016, were well below the regional and global averages (Figure 1, right panel).
Although	 basic	digital	infrastructure	 is	in	place,	its	
speed, quality, and capacity must be increased to meet	the	demands	 of	the	digital	economy. Most 
mobile broadband subscriptions operate in 2G and 
3G services since 4G coverage remains limited. At 
50 percent of the population, LTE/WiMAX coverage, bandwidth per internet user, and other indicators 
remain below regional and global averages (Table 1). 
Low fixed-broadband adoption in Cambodia may 
be due to a combination of factors, including limited 
availability of optical fiber in rural areas, the low number 
of households with a computer, and the relatively low 
price of mobile-broadband internet compared to fixed-
broadband internet.
Despite	 significant	 progress	 in	recent	 years,	
Cambodia still has a long way to go in digital adoption 
and technological readiness. The nature, pace, and 
extent of digital development will be determined by a 
combination of technical and non-technical factors, 
such as regulations, skills, and institutions (the so-called 
“analogue complements”). According to the World 
Bank´s Digital Adoption Index which measures the 
global spread of technology among people, businesses, and governments, Cambodia is currently at the lower 
end of the regional scale in the East Asia and Pacific 
(EAP) region, particularly with regard to adoption by 
businesses and government (Figure 2).

While digital adoption by people has surged in 
recent years, internet penetration remains low. As 
mentioned above, the expansion of fixed-line internet 
services in Cambodia has been largely overshadowed 
by the strong focus on mobile services. Cambodia 
currently has one of the lowest fixed internet broadband 
penetration rates in the region. While the number of 
internet users has increased in recent years to reach 
approximately one-quarter of the population, digital 
literacy remains low. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many users navigate exclusively through Facebook and 
are unlikely to fully exploit the potential of the World 
Wide Web. 
Digital adoption by firms is 
constrained by challenges in accessing financial services as well as by lack of skilled staff and an adequate legal framework
Little	quantitative	 information	 is	available	 on	
the	actual	size	and	scope	of	Cambodia’s	 digital	
economy today. The extent and composition of 
Cambodia’s digital economy has not yet been mapped. 
E-commerce platforms are available, including Alibaba, 
and locally based services for food delivery and ride-
hailing apps like PassAPP are increasingly popular. 
Social media influencers and new payment platforms are 
also emerging in Cambodia, particularly in Phnom Penh. 
However, no systematic information is available on the size of these emerging sectors and the employment 
generated. 
Digital	adoption	 at	the	firm	level	appears	 to	be	
lagging other countries. Fewer than one-quarter of 
businesses had a web presence in 2017, well below 
the world median of 46 percent. Cambodia also has a 
very low number of secure servers per million people 
(Figure 3).
2  Some of these aspects are discussed in more detail in a companion Policy Note on Microfinance and Household Welfare. Access to finance, 
particularly for tech entrepreneurs, is also a significant challenge and is discussed in greater detail in a companion Policy Note on Entrepreneurship 
and Innovation.  The Government has flagged this area as a priority and has established a Capacity Building and Research Fund (USD 8-10 million per year, sourced from a one percent tax on gross revenues of telecom services providers), but issues include governance, eligibility, monitoring and evaluation of firms, and how to meet the demand for technical assistance for participa ting firms.The	limited	uptake	of	digital	financial	 services	 in	
Cambodia	 is	likely	to	constrain	 the	development	
of	the	digital	economy. In 2016, only 1 percent of 
adults in Cambodia used a mobile phone or the internet 
to access an account at a financial institution—the 
lowest rate in the world, according to the World Bank´s 
Global Findex (Figure 4, left panel). Around 16 percent 
of Cambodians made a digital payment in 2016 using 
payment platforms like PiPay, which is still well below 
the EAP average of 58 percent. Cambodia´s lack of a guiding framework for developing digital financial 
services and digital payment services is a root cause for 
the low uptake. While some financial institutions have 
introduced mobile services, authorization is granted on 
a case-by-case basis due to the lack of transparent 
guidelines, which will likely delay the introduction of 
digital financial services by other operators. In addition, 
Cambodia does not have a National Payment System, 
which limits exchange among domestic operators.

Another	 challenge	 is	the	lack	of	a	workforce	 with	
sufficient	 IT	skills. According to Digital Rain, two-thirds 
of businesses in the IT sector reported being unable Note : The global median r efers to both 2015 and 2017.

to hire staff with adequate IT skills.3 The short supply 
of qualified employees at the senior and managerial 
level results in very high remuneration packages, which 
jeopardizes the potential to promote Cambodia as a 
new international outsourcing location for IT services. 
Moreover, most large firms in the sector reportedly prefer 
3  Markova and Wray, 2016. to hire individuals with soft skills and provide training in IT skills, which is not feasible for startups that do not have 
the resources to provide extensive training. Instead, 
they rely on the few experienced programmers who can 
work independently. This problem is compounded by 
low employee retention rates in the sector.  Source: World Bank Global Findex, 2017; Mastercard e-wallet survey , 2016. Figur e 4. Cambodia has been lagging in the use of digital payments

Finally,	digital	adoption	 by	firms	is	also	constrained	
by	the	lack	of	a	supportive	 legal	framework	 for	
e-transactions,	 data	protection	 and	privacy,	
consumer	 protection	 for	online	purchases,	 and	
cybercrime	 prevention.	 Cambodia´s incomplete legal 
and regulatory framework for e-transactions hurts 
consumer trust in digital services. In January 2018, 
the government issued a Decree on Digital Signatures, 
but the draft e-commerce and cybersecurity laws have 
not yet been adopted, and data protection and privacy issues have not been addressed (Table 2).
Digital government remains 
fragmented
The	current	 state	of	digital	government	 is	largely	
siloed	 and	fragmented. Two government-wide 
e-government programs have been attempted in 
Cambodia, with mixed results. At present, Cambodia 
does not have a unified national government portal. 
Instead, there are approximately 60 websites, all 
developed independently without reference to standards 
for user interface, look-and-feel, development approach, 
technical platform, or security. The result is a variety of 
user interface styles, many of which resemble earlier generations of website design. The typical government 
website is simple and focused on providing information. 
Although most have at least partial dual-language 
support for English, most of the content is in Khmer only. 
There are also no standards for website security. The 
Ministry of Posts and Telecom (MPTC) is using part of the 
Capacity Building and Research Fund (financed by a 1 
percent levy on the net revenues of telecom companies) 
to develop a Lab that will focus on website development, hosting, and standardization. Globally, Cambodia falls in 
the second quintile for online provision of government 
services according to UNDESA’s Online Service Index.  
The MPTC has established a National Data Center, 
but it is unclear whether it will be able to reduce 
fragmentation	 among	agencies. The National Data 
Center hosts the government email platform, a Content Management System, and some agency websites. 
4  Payment can be made offline, but the receipt must be physically submitted before registration can be completed.However, it is unclear whether MPTC has the capacity to provide large-scale data center services at a sufficient 
level. Other agencies are investing in their own data 
centers, and several use private cloud services for data 
storage. For example, the MEF is developing multiple 
data centers to support the Financial Management 
Information System as well as tax applications. 
Cambodia does not have an overall government data 
center or cloud services policy framework.
Some	online	services	 are	available	 to	citizens	 and	
businesses. The most mature of these services is 
the business registration process on the Ministry of 
Commerce website. The process can be completed 
entirely online, including payment.
4 Another end-to-end 
process available online is the issuance of single-entry 
tourist visas.  Visitors can apply for the visa online and 
pay with a credit card. The approval letter is emailed to 
the recipient, who can then present the letter upon entry 
into Cambodia. 
While	tax	registration	 and	payment	 can	be	
performed	 online	to	some	degree,	 taxes	cannot	
be	filed	electronically. Registration can be partially 
completed online, but the taxpayer still needs to visit the 
General Department of Taxation (GDT) to complete the 
process. An e-payment service is available but is limited 
to specific banks, and the service is only available to 
customers of specific ISPs: EZECOM and CellCard. 
E-customs is transactional but not connected with other 
systems.
The	absence	 of	a	centralized	 multilateral	 payments	
platform	 linking	all	banks	and	billers	is	a	key	
constraint	 to	more	versatile	 online	services	 delivery	
by	government	 and	private	companies. While power 
bills in urban areas and water bills in Phnom Penh can 
be paid online, this service is only available through 
certain bank channels (e.g., ABA Bank) and third-party 
payment facilities (Wing). The government and private 
companies could provide many more services online if 
a centralized multi-lateral payments platform linking all banks and billers could be developed. Digital Economy  | 13
Several	 institutions	 are	involved	 in	digital	
government	 development. The Department of 
E-government in MPTC’s General Department of 
ICT provides technical direction to implement the 
government’s agenda by supporting the efforts of an 
Inter-Ministry Technical Working Group—the platform 
for interagency technical collaboration that helped 
develop the draft E-Government Master Plan.5 The 
Ministry of Interior is responsible for policies and 
regulations related to identification, a central element 
in both digital government and the digital economy in 
general.6 A new identification card with a blank chip 
has been introduced, but functionality has not been developed, and there is no e-signature. Finally, the 
MEF serves as a gatekeeper for decisions on ICT 
investments across agencies. 
Overall	 planning	 and	budgeting	 for	digital	
government	 are	not	systematic. Cambodia has a 
decentralized Treasury Single Account. However, the 
Financial Management Information System does not have a budget planning and formulation module, and 
there is no e-procurement. In addition, each agency 
makes its own decisions on solutions and infrastructure 
investment and includes them as part of their budget 
proposals. These decisions are not discussed by 
an inter-institutional Committee or subject to central 
scrutiny, although funding decisions are ultimately 
processed by MEF. The absence of central review and 
coordination has resulted in redundant infrastructure and data communication channels, duplication of 
efforts, and inefficient deployment of software and 
licensing, which undermines data compatibility and 
system interoperability and makes re-engineering 
costlier. In addition, since ICT spending is spread across 
the entire government and appears in different spending 
categories, expenditure tracking and comparison to 
global benchmarks are more difficult.
5  The Technical Working Group reports to a nominal Inter-Ministry Policy Working Group comprising Under Secretaries of State from all ministries 
and chaired by the Minister of MPTC. In principle, this committee is expected to ensure cross-ministry ICT policy coordination, but its activities and 
impact are limited. In practical terms, the Policy Working Group largely defers to the Technical Working Group on digital government matters.6  The Minister of Interior chairs the National Steering Committee on CRVS and Identification (NSCI), and its General Department of Identification 
acts as the secretariat to the committee. In 2016, the NSCI put forward the National Strategic Plan of Identification (2017-2026), which proposed integrating and consolidating all current civil registration and identification schemes into a single structure, supported by a single ICT-based platform. However, funding to this has not yet been allocated.Policy Options
To	benefit	 from	the	digital	economy,	 Cambodia	
needs	to	establish	 several	 enabling	 factors. In 
addition to broader business climate reforms—including 
business registration, financing, and related reforms—it 
will be important for Cambodia to: (i) invest in connectivity 
infrastructure; (ii) develop digital skills; (iii) adopt a legal 
and regulatory framework for privacy, data protection, 
e-commerce (including e-transactions), and the wider 
“e-enabling” environment; and (iv) build institutions 
and leadership, as well as universal standards for e-government platforms and applications. Policies are 
detailed in Table 3 and discussed below.  
The	financing	 and	budget	 implications	 for	each	
policy option must be analyzed, especially to 
identify	 possible	 funding	 mechanisms	 and	the	
potential	 for	private	sector	private	financing.  Where 
public financing is mobilized because private sector 
engagement is not optimal or available (e.g., to catalyze 
the rollout of connectivity infrastructure), the investment 
and economic rates of return must be calculated to 
ensure value for money for the Government. Efforts to develop coordinated digital government platforms 
may trigger upfront capital costs, for example to build 
e-government platforms and applications, but will 
generate significant ongoing capital and operational 
cost savings. The wider net economic impacts from 
improved connectivity, widespread availability of efficient 
digital government services, and an expanding digital 
economy should also be calculated as part of the 
impact assessment for each Policy Area. In principle, policy options related to the adoption of regulation, 
such as those for the short term under Policy Area (iii), 
are expected to be broadly cost-neutral from a budget 
perspective. Cambodia Policy Note  | 14
In	the	first	policy	area,	new	investments	 are	needed	
in	the	infrastructure	 that	serves	as	the	foundation	
for	the	digital	economy. Cambodia has achieved 
widespread basic mobile connectivity but needs to 
meet rapidly rising demand for higher-capacity and 
faster internet services. Key challenges to be addressed 
include increasing mobile broadband provision for rural 
and remote areas and ensuring consistent quality of 
service; investing in fixed broadband in urban areas to 
meet the rapidly growing demand for high-bandwidth applications, including video streaming, large data 
processing, and e-government applications; and laying 
the groundwork for connected devices (internet of things), including sensor networks, transport systems, and security and logistics systems. 
Spectrum	 reallocation	 and	improved	 management	
are	required	 to	support	 further	mobile	broadband	
rollout in rural areas. This involves reassigning the 700 
Mhz band, which is currently used for broadcasting, 
and managing the reallocation of already assigned 
spectrum on a technology-neutral basis. In addition, 
the Government should mandate passive infrastructure 
sharing among operators, particularly for fixed broadband. Passive infrastructure accounts for up to 
80 percent of investment costs for infrastructure rollout. Table 3. Policy options to support digital development in Cambodia
Objectives Short-term options (1-2 years) Medium- and long-term options 
(3+ years)
i. Close the digital divide by 
coordinating investment 
in and use of connectivity 
infrastructure• Enhance spectrum reallocation and management to support further mobile 
broadband rollout in rural areas 
• Promote or mandate passive infrastructure 
sharing among telecom operators, particularly for fixed broadband
• Enable co-location of optical fiber during the planning and implementation of other infrastructure projects • Introduce fees or licenses for cloud service provision and 
software development
ii. Support the 
development of digital 
skills• Undertake a systematic assessment of the digital skills gap and develop a Digital Skills Readiness Strategy• Promote continued professional development and support cost-sharing and cooperation among 
firms
iii. Complete the regulatory 
framework governing the 
digital economy, to boost 
digital adoption by firms• Expedite the adoption of an up-to-date 
E-commerce law and Cybercrime law 
• Prepare a Data Protection and Privacy law
• Introduce a framework on the use of mobile banking and payments• Implement the national payment system strategy
iv. Align efforts toward 
the implementation of a Digital Government Strategy• Prepare a time-bound, costed implementation plan for the Digital Government Strategy
• Develop an integrated digital platform for 
government services, a data center, and a 
government cloud
• Consider establishing a Coordinating Agency for Digital Development• Integrate the national ID to support digital authentication of identity and facilitate e-transactions
• Streamline digital government-related investment decisions as part of the Public Investment Management discussions
• Introduce a core set of technical 
and functional standards for ICT 
investmentsDigital Economy  | 15
New infrastructure investments could also be better 
coordinated across sectors as part of project planning 
and implementation for transport or energy networks, 
to enable co-location of optical fiber and facilitate rights 
of way. Finally, authorities should carefully consider the 
need for multiple license requirements and new taxation.
The	second	 policy	area	focuses	 on	developing	
the	digital	skills	necessary	 for	the	benefits	 of	the	
digital economy to be shared widely. Authorities are 
considering deploying resources from the Capacity-
Building and Research Fund for Skills Development. In partnership with business community representatives, 
the Government should also undertake a systematic 
assessment of the skills gap and develop a Digital 
Skills Readiness Strategy to address current and future 
workforce needs. The assessment should include 
an assessment of the availability of IT skills in non-IT 
sectors to anticipate needs and prevent brain drain from an already under-resourced IT industry. Firms in the IT 
sector would also benefit from increased cooperation 
and cost sharing for training and professional 
development courses (Table 4). 
Within the third policy area, completing the legal 
and	regulatory	 framework	 for	e-commerce,	 privacy,	
and data protection and cybercrime—together with	other	measures	 aimed	at	improving	 the	
business	 environment—would	 encourage	 digital	
adoption by businesses. The incomplete legal and regulatory framework for e-commerce, including for 
e-transactions, undermines trust in digital services. The 
adoption of laws related to e-commerce and cybercrime 
should be expedited. The Government should also draft 
a law for data protection and privacy. In addition, the 
Government should introduce a framework for the use 
of mobile banking and payments and implement a national payment system.

The	fourth	 policy	 area	supports	 successful 	
implementation	 of	the	Digital	Government	 Strategy 	
by	aligning	 Government	 efforts	 and	improving 	
interagency coordination. E-government requires 
7 Vuorikari, et al., 2016.strong leadership, a high degree of coordination to provide the supporting infrastructure, and a combination 
of app development and business process changes 
to deliver services to people. The Government needs 
to prepare a time-bound, costed implementation plan 
for the Digital Government Strategy, focusing first on 
e-government enablers such as digital ID, payment 
platforms, and open data. This should be accompanied 
by a monitoring framework to review progress and 
outcomes on a systematic basis. It could be beneficial for the Government to establish a Coordinating Agency 
for Digital Development—similar to those established 
in the United Kingdom, Singapore, Malaysia, and 
Thailand—to drive the preparation of the framework 
and its implementation. Finally, investment decisions 
related to e-government should be streamlined and 
discussed within the public investment management 
process while considering alternative models for 
infrastructure and service delivery, such as public-private partnerships. 
Successful	 implementation	 of	the	strategy	 also	
requires	 reforms	 specific	 to	e-government. The 
Government should develop an integrated digital 
platform for government services, connecting all 
agencies. Population, business, and land registries must 
be current, secure, and interoperable. The government 
could facilitate this by establishing a central data center or cloud service that features public and private access, 
depending on the data management requirements. 
The Government also needs to integrate digital 
authentication of identity with the national ID to facilitate 
e-transactions, including the delivery of e-government 
services. In addition, a manageable list of priority apps 
and public services to be offered online, including at the 
subnational level, should be identified.
In	addition,	 to	ensure	effective	 returns	as	well	as	
the	interoperability	 needed	to	integrate	 government	
data	and	deliver	services,	 a	set	of	technical	 and	
functional	 standards	 for	ICT	investments	 should	be	
adopted. Virtually every government on a path toward 
successful digital transformation has established these Cambodia Policy Note  | 16
standards. For example, the United States and Australia 
have standards based on an Enterprise Architecture 
Reference Model, New Zealand and the United Kingdom 
have Interoperability Frameworks, and Vietnam’s 
eGovernment standard is based on the The Open 
Group Architecture Framework. The policy framework and specific standards developed by Cambodia need to be identified through further analysis, but the 
following areas should be considered: architecture, 
technical, networking, security, information, ICT service 
management, data management and sharing, and data 
center and cloud services.
