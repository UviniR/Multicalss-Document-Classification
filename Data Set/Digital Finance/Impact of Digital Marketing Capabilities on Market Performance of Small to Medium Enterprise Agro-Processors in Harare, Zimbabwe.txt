Digital data continues to provide information that 
remains central to market planning. However, marketers 
have to make huge decisions on the type of information 
to consider (Orlandi, 2016). The huge volumes of data is 
challenging traditional marketing capabilities (Day, 2011) 
yet information processing capabilities are critical (Day, 
1994) to any business. In addition, digital innovations 
have created a marketing capabilities gap that need to be 
closed (Orlandi, 2016). New technologies create markets 
and consumers with new sets of expectations resulting 
in new value creation processes (Gielens & Steenkamp, 
2019; Kotler et  al., 2017). Investments in technological 
resources alone cannot lead to superior market perfor -
mance, instead new marketing capabilities are required IMPACT OF DIGITAL MARKETING CAPABILITIES ON MARKET

Abstract. The importance of marketing capabilities continues to grow yet research remains concentrated in developed 
markets. Although several researchers provide evidence of the influence of marketing capabilities on market performance, 
very little of similar evidence exists in the digital marketing domain. Empirical evidence of the impact of digital marketing 
capabilities on market performance of small to medium enterprise (SME) agro-processors particularly from developing 
countries remains scarce.  The purpose of this paper was to investigate the impact of digital marketing capabilities on SME 
agro-processors’ both intermediate and final market performance outcomes. To achieve this, we conducted a survey of 298 
SME agro-processors’ managers and owners in Harare, Zimbabwe. A mixed sampling approach consisting of quota and 
stratified sampling approaches was adopted. We distributed a closed-ended questionnaire through the drop-off & pick-up 
and interviewer-based methods. The data was analysed statistically using STATA version 15. Multiple logistic regression 
was conducted to determine impact of digital marketing capabilities on market performance. Our findings indicate that 
digital strategy development & execution, digital market innovation, e-market sensing and leadership capabilities positively 
influence intermediate market outcomes of customer awareness, customer attitudes, availability, and brand associations. 
However only digital strategy development & execution capability was positively associated with final market performance 
outcomes of sales growth, market share and profitability. These results imply that agro-processors must develop digital 
marketing capabilities that enable them to move beyond intermediate market outcomes to attain the primary business 
objectives of profitability, sales growth and market share. Attaining intermediate market outcomes only is not enough for 
business sustainability. The study contributes to literature by extending the marketing capabilities discussion to the digital 
marketing environment in a developing country context. This was important because marketing knowledge is contextual, 
as such cannot easily be transferred from one market to the other.

Introduction and background
This paper extends prior studies on marketing capabili-
ties and market performance by empirically interrogat-
ing the impact of digital marketing capabilities on SME 
agro-processors’ market performance (both intermediate 
and final market performance outcomes). Existing knowl-
edge and practices have been challenged (Foltean, 2019; 
de Ruyter et  al., 2018; Wymbs, 2011) due to the strong 
and fast paced digital developments that keep changing 
markets. As changes in marketing environments occur, 
consumer needs change and marketers must find appro-
priate communication needs to satisfy their customers 
(Davidaviciene et al., 2019).Business: Theory and Practice, 2020, 21(2): 746–757 747
(Trainor et al., 2013). Digital marketing environments are 
highly dynamic, fast-paced and unstable therefore require 
dynamic and adaptive marketing capabilities. Digital mar -
keting capabilities are thus a class of marketing capabilities 
required in the digital marketing environment which are 
not the same as those required in traditional marketing 
environments. The variation originates from the applica-
tion of technology required to execute the same tradi-
tional marketing capabilities. For example, market sensing 
is required in all marketing environments, but in digital 
marketing environments there is more use of digital mar -
keting tools/technology than in physical environments to 
execute market sensing. That “extra” need for technology 
calls for a different set of capabilities which we are call-
ing digital marketing capabilities. Researchers are increas-
ingly realising the need for specific marketing resources 
and capabilities for the digital marketing environment. For 
example Habibi et al. (2015) suggested a move from tra-
ditional market orientation of Kholi and Jaworski (1990) 
and Narver and Slater (1990) to electronic market orienta -
tion that is developed to meet needs of digital marketing. 
Marketing capabilities such as intelligence gathering and 
information dissemination have been emphasised on be-
fore (Kholi & Jaworski, 1990), however the missing part 
is on how firms execute the same in digital marketing 
environments. Thus, the transformation from traditional 
markets to digital marketing requires new marketing ca-
pabilities (Gregory et  al., 2019) and new knowledge on 
the nexus between the digital marketing capabilities and 
market performance.
Marketing researchers have always linked marketing 
capabilities to market performance (Qureshi et al., 2017; 
Mathews et  al., 2016; Teece, 2016; Morgan et  al., 2009; 
Hooley et al., 2005). The prominence of the capabilities 
approach among marketing researchers resulted in sev-
eral studies substantiating the influence of marketing ca-
pabilities on market performance. However, the marketing 
capability approach has evolved in response to changes 
in technology and the general marketing environment. 
These changes brings to question existing evidence on the 
linkage between “traditional” marketing capabilities and 
market performance. In addition, disparate evidence was 
found on the linkage between different marketing capa-
bilities and market performance. For example, researchers 
found dynamic capabilities to differently influence market 
performance under different conditions. One stream of re-
search believes dynamic capabilities are more important in 
dynamic environments, another stream believes dynamic 
capabilities are relevant in moderately stable environments 
than in  stable and dynamic environments whilst the third 
stream believe they are relevant in both dynamic and sta-
ble environments (Zhou et al., 2019). There is therefore 
a general lack of empirical research on the link between 
marketing capabilities and market performance (Zhou 
et al., 2019) neither is there a widely accepted classifica-
tion of marketing capabilities (Kaleka & Morgan, 2019).  
Little is known on the influence of technology-based capabilities on market performance (Gregory et al., 2019) 
consequently posing a question on the identification of 
appropriate digital marketing capabilities to develop and 
deploy (Guo et al., 2018). Knowledge of appropriate digi-
tal marketing capabilities is important because not all ca-
pabilities contribute to market performance in the same 
way. In addition, marketing capabilities of large firms are 
widely known, whilst little is known in small firms (Khan, 
2017) particularly in the digital marketing context. This is 
despite the recognition that, SMEs require different capa-
bilities to those of larger entities (Khan, 2017). 
In the Zimbabwean SME agro-processors context, re-
search on the linkage between digital marketing capabili-
ties and market performance is scarce. Previous research 
has dominantly focussed on agro-processors challenges 
(Mhazo et  al., 2012), SME policy issues (Chigwenya & 
Mudzengerere, 2013), informal sector (Matsongoni & 
Mutambara, 2018), and government policies on SMEs 
(Bomani, 2016). Linking SME agro-processors’ digital 
marketing capabilities to performance is important in the 
Zimbabwean context and other developing countries with 
similar conditions. Zimbabwe is an agro-based economy 
therefore agro-processors significantly contribute to job 
creation, poverty alleviation and livelihoods (AfDB, 2018; 
ITAC, 2016; Ampadu-Ameyaw & Omari, 2015). The clo-
sure of large enterprises also left a huge gap that SMEs 
filled in, as such they are important to the economy. How-
ever, the SMEs digital marketing capabilities and market 
performance remains vague. Existing research rarely con-
sider traditional sectors such as SME agro-processors of 
developing countries (Zhou et  al., 2019; Wendra et  al., 
2019). Elsewhere, although researchers are recognising 
the need for new knowledge, and marketing capabilities 
in the fast-paced digital marketing environment, research 
in this area is still sparse. Extant literature is dominantly 
traditional marketing oriented except a few studies on in-
ternet marketing capabilities (Mathews et al., 2016; Jean & 
Kim, 2019), digital business models (Verhoef & Bijmolt, 
2019), and e-commerce marketing capabilities (Gregory 
et al., 2019). 
This study primarily interrogated the impact of digi-
tal marketing capabilities on market performance of SME 
agro-processors in Harare, Zimbabwe. To achieve this 
objective, the study adopted a cross-sectional survey that 
used a closed questionnaire for data collection. The data 
was collected from SME agro-processors’ marketing man-
agers or owners. To determine digital marketing capabili-
ties impact on market performance, a multiple logistic re-
gression was conducted using STATA version 15.
The study contributes to the marketing capability – 
market performance discussion by interrogating the im-
pact of selected digital marketing capabilities on market 
performance of SME agro-processors in Harare, Zimba-
bwe. In-depth knowledge on agro-processors is central to 
the economic development of Zimbabwe because of the 
country’s strong economic linkages with agriculture. Evi-
dence from a developing country context contributes to 748 M. Chinakidzwa, M. Phiri. Impact of digital marketing capabilities on market performance of small to medium...
the applicability and transfer of market knowledge since 
marketing is contextual (Sheth, 2011) thus the study pro-
vides an opportunity to validate theory developed from the 
West and generalise findings (Zhou et al., 2019).  Knowl-
edge on digital marketing capabilities of agro-processors 
in Zimbabwe also contributes to the body of knowledge 
on SMEs, agro-processors and market performance. 
The study offers a new integrative position on the link-
age between digital marketing capabilities and market 
performance of a relatively under researched industry 
(agro-processing). This is important because capabilities 
of larger enterprises are always different to those of SMEs 
(Khan, 2017). To the best of our knowledge, this study is 
the first to link digital marketing capabilities and market 
performance of agro-processors in Zimbabwe. The rest 
of this paper is structured as follows, section 1, theo-
retical framework, section 2,  conceptual and hypothesis 
development, section 3, methodology, section 4, results, 
discussion and conclusions, limitations and further re-
search. 
1. Theoretical framework
This study is anchored on the capabilities approach which 
is an extension of the resource based view (RBV). The 
RBV attributes performance differences in firms to dif-
ferences in resources possessed by the firm. According 
to the RBV , resources that are valuable, rare, inimitable, 
and organisable in a unique way (VRIO) leads to supe-
rior performance (Barney & Hesterly, 2015). However, re-
searchers criticised the RBV for being static, and internally 
oriented thus failing to explain performance differences 
in dynamic environments. Researchers further pointed 
that possession of resources alone is not enough, capabili-
ties are required to profitably convert resources into value 
(Trainor et al., 2013). Marketing capabilities are complex 
bundles of skills and concentrated knowledge that effec-
tively deploy and update existing resources (Day, 1994; 
Grant, 1991). Marketing capabilities are influenced by in-
ternal and external marketing conditions (Qureshi et al., 
2017). Therefore the marketing capabilities approach view 
performance differences in firms as a result of differences 
in ability to deploy and utilise marketing resources. Extant 
literature, (Hunt & Madhavaram, 2019; Bitencourt et al., 
2019; Zhou et  al., 2019; Teece, 2016; Day, 2014; Teece 
et  al., 1997) explain different types of capabilities rang-
ing from static, dynamic to adaptive that influence mar -
ket performance. Static capabilities are found in the RBV , 
thus are internally oriented and fail to recognise the need 
for agility in fast paced digital marketing environments. 
Contemporary marketing research has shifted focus to 
dynamic capabilities (Bitencourt et  al., 2019; Gregory 
et  al., 2019; Zhou et  al., 2019) and adaptive capabilities 
(Day, 2014). Dynamic capabilities emphasise the “key 
role of management in appropriately adapting, integrat-
ing, and reconfiguring internal and external experience, 
resources, and functional competences within a changing environment” (Gregory et al., 2019). Dynamic capabilities 
take the view that an organisation can swiftly adapt and 
alter its internal resource conﬁguration to support mar -
keting processes to demand after receiving clear market 
signals  (Morgan, 2012). Dynamic capabilities are those 
capabilities that “enable the firm to implement strategies 
using new and different combinations and transforma-
tion of resources” to match the changing market condi-
tions  (Teece, et al., 1997). Performance differences under 
dynamic capabilities are a result of dynamic markets and 
differences in capabilities that firms acquire and utilise 
to deploy resources instead of heterogeneous resources 
(Wang & Kim, 2017). Although dynamic capabilities take 
cognisance of environmental dynamism, they take an in-
side-out approach (Day, 1994) thereby risk missing some 
weak market signals. According to Day (1994), fast-paced 
unstable environmental conditions require adaptive ca-
pabilities that take an outside-in approach. By so doing, 
adaptive capabilities allows marketers to view the market 
with an open mind thereby increasing chances of pick-
ing weak market signals. Adaptive capabilities starts with 
the external environment, and takes a proactive approach 
(Guo et  al., 2018) enabling a deep focus into customer 
problems and issues before looking inside the organisa-
tion for solutions. Adaptive capability require “extensible 
ability to proactively sense and act on market signals, con-
tinuously learn from market experiments, integrate and 
coordinate social network resources to adapt to market 
changes and predict industry trends” (Guo et al., 2018). A 
study by Guo et al. (2018) testing the influence of the three 
capabilities found adaptive marketing capabilities to have 
the largest influence on market performance. 
Even though there has been a shift to dynamic and 
adaptive capabilities, little or no specific attention has 
been given specifically to digital marketing capabilities. 
This has led to lack of evidence on how SME agro-proces-
sors who are generally known to be resource constrained 
deploy and capture digital marketing capabilities’ influ-
ence on market performance. It is therefore necessary to 
develop new evidence for the linkage from a developing 
country context. The development of marketing capabili-
ties contributes to competitive advantage (Morgan et al., 
2009) and firms develop capabilities through repetition, 
constant application of skills and efforts (Qureshi et al., 
2017) but how does this happen in fast paced dynamic 
digital marketing environments? SME agro-processors 
require marketing capabilities to recognise, enhance, and 
evaluate opportunities and in turn to develop products 
that fulfil customer needs in selected markets (Day, 1994; 
Zhou et al., 2019). This entails appropriate pricing, real 
time communication that includes all aspects of interest 
to the customers and product availability in customers’ 
channels of choice. 
Although evidence of how marketing capabilities have 
evolved exist, no similar evidence exist on the linkage of 
digital marketing capabilities and market performance. 
While researchers seem to converge on the influence of Business: Theory and Practice, 2020, 21(2): 746–757 749
marketing capabilities to market performance (Zhou et al., 
2019; Qureshi et al., 2017; Morgan et al., 2009; Bitencourt 
et  al., 2019; Davick & Sharma, 2016; Cacciolatti & Lee, 
2016; Day, 2014), different perspectives with little empiri-
cal evidence exist on the contribution of different market-
ing capabilities. Further, extant literature on market per -
formance is characterised by conflicting definitions and 
views on concepts and drivers of market performance. 
The extent to which variables such as marketing capabili-
ties influence market performance differ from one mar -
ket to the other, and from one study to another. There is 
no agreement on the inclusion or exclusion of financial 
measures in market performance discussions. For ex-
ample Frosen et al. (2016) consider market performance 
measures of customers, competitors, and ﬁnancials whilst 
Milfelner et  al. (2008) consider market share, sales and 
loyalty. Whilst Frosen et al. (2016) included financials in 
market performance, Milfelner et  al. (2008) considered 
profit levels, margin and return on investment (ROI) as 
part of financial performance. In another definition Hom-
burg et al. (2007) clearly mixing financial measures and 
market measures considered market or marketing perfor -
mance as a measure of an organisation’s abilities to attain 
revenue, market share and growth goals through its activi-
ties and right use of resources in a cost-effective way. On 
the other hand Clark (2007) market performance meas-
urement framework splits market performance outcomes 
into two that is intermediate market outcomes and final 
market outcomes. Although the framework allows com-
bining financial and non-financial measures, it does not 
provide specific marketing activities or capabilities that 
can be linked to market performance. Therefore, no single 
approach can succinctly capture market performance, re-
searchers always need to carefully adopt a basket of meas-
ures (Sergie et al., 2007). 
Building on this theoretical background, the study 
views digital marketing environment as highly unstable, 
dynamic and unpredictable therefore requires a good 
balance of dynamic and adaptive marketing capabilities. 
This mix of outside-in and inside-out approaches equips 
marketers to create superior market performance that 
competitors cannot easily match. We take the view that 
dynamic capabilities enables a firm to develop capabilities 
to identify and respond to market opportunities (Gregory 
et al., 2019) which complements the RBV perspective of 
resource and capability exploitation based on market op-
portunities. Further, adaptive capabilities encourages ac -
tive sensing, experimentation and open learning which 
strengthens an organisation’s capability base. Because of 
its power to explain performance differences in dynamic, 
volatile and unpredictable digital markets, the marketing 
capability approach forms the theoretical foundation for 
our arguments. The study extends the marketing capability 
approach to dynamic digital marketing environments and 
links it to market performance. Considering the disparities 
in market performance measurement, the study considers 
market performance as a measure of intermediate market outcomes and final market outcomes (Clark, 2007). Final 
market performance outcomes blended financial and mar -
ket related measures of sales growth, revenue and profit-
ability whilst intermediate market performance measures 
considered consumer attitudes, awareness, availability, 
brand associations and customer satisfaction. 
2. Conceptual and hypothesis development
The first set of digital marketing capabilities examined in 
this paper are e-market sensing capabilities. Firms need 
market sensing capabilities to identify opportunities, and 
seizing capabilities to exploit the opportunities (Teece, 
2014). Market sensing are outside-in (adaptive) capabili-
ties (Day, 1994) that promote “free” exploration of the 
external environment. According to Day (1994), market-
sensing capabilities entail active gathering, interpretation, 
and dissemination of market information. The digital 
world gives customers a “voice” , more choices, and access 
thus empowering them (Chaffey & Ellis-Chadwick, 2016). 
In view of the empowered customers, it is imperative that 
marketers constantly monitor market changes and take 
proactive action. Digital marketing technologies allow or -
ganisations to easily sense and respond to market needs 
(Setia et al., 2013). Constant learning brings new knowl-
edge that is essential to market orientation (Day, 2011) 
and value creation processes. Although generally there is 
evidence of strong informal linkages among SME agro-
processors, their customers and suppliers, (Mhazo et al., 
2012) no evidence exist of their e-market sensing capabili-
ties. Therefore, we posit our first hypothesis as:
Hypothesis 1: E-market sensing capabilities positively 
influence agro-processors’ a) intermediate market perfor -
mance outcomes, and b) final market performance out-
comes.
The second set of digital marketing capabilities are 
digital strategy development and execution capabilities. 
This is firm’s ability to create and implement e-strategy 
for the attainment of marketing objectives (Chaffey, 2015; 
Vorhies & Morgan, 2005). Strategy formulation require 
an understanding of both internal and external environ -
ment (Barney & Hesterly, 2015; Chaffey & Ellis-Chadwick, 
2016) as such calling for dynamic and adaptive marketing 
capabilities. Digital market strategy options can include 
customer propositions, customer acquisition efforts, cus-
tomer conversion & experience ingenuities, development 
& growth, channel integration, and site improvements 
(Charlesworth, 2018). Failure to define clearly strategy 
can lead to missed opportunities, wrong direction, narrow 
integration, inadequate collection of customer data, and 
resource wastages (Chaffey, 2015). Vorhies and Morgan 
(2005) found strategy development and implementation 
capabilities to influence market performance. In another 
study, Abdullah et al. (2019) found e-strategy to influence 
consumers’ online banking adoption. Marketers cannot 
afford to ignore the value of research and strategy in the 
digital marketing environment (WSI, 2015). However, 750 M. Chinakidzwa, M. Phiri. Impact of digital marketing capabilities on market performance of small to medium...

 Leadership capability  Digital strategy develop ment & 
implem entation  there is no evidence or conceptualisation of digital strat-
egy development and execution capabilities in SME agro-
processors yet strategy development, and execution can 
provide causal ambiguities that competitors cannot easily 
imitate. We therefore posit that: 
Hypothesis 2: Agro-processors’ digital strategy de-
velopment and execution capabilities positively influence 
their a) intermediate market performance outcomes, and 
b) final market performance outcomes.
The third capability we interrogated in this study was 
digital market innovation capabilities. According to Cal -
antone et al. (2002), innovation is the development of nov-
el ideas, processes, models, products and their subsequent 
acceptance and implementation. Innovation is an outcome 
of learning process (Romijn & Albaladejo, 2002) that e-
market sensing capability can provide. Innovation capabil -
ity are the skills and knowledge required to successfully 
recognise, grasp, and enhance prevailing technologies, and 
develop new ones (Romijn & Albaladejo, 2002). Barrett 
et al. (2015, p. 45) deriving from Y oo et al. (2010, p. 726) 
defined digital innovation as the novel blending of digital 
and physical components to create products (services in-
cluded) as a result of  data gathered from different sourc-
es to deliver services that eliminate industry boundaries. 
Therefore this study considers digital market innovation 
capabilities to be the abilities to create value through the 
development of new digital market ideas, processes, mod-
els and products utilising digital market data and tech-
nologies.  Digital market innovation has the potential to 
contribute to the development of sustainable competitive 
advantage (Hooley et al., 2005), contribute to firm growth 
(Kyriakopoulos et al., 2015, p. 398) and  drive develop-
ment in developing countries regardless of infrastructure 
and other resource limitations (Barrett et al., 2015). Ac-
cording to Barrett et al. (2015) innovation in developing 
countries is not the same to that of developed markets 
due to resource differences. Barrett et al. (2015) found that 
innovators in developing countries are good at managing 
costs, small adjustments to products, & business models, 
and developing innovations using few resources because 
of the constraints that they face. 
In view of these innovation capability contributions in 
resource-constrained environments, it is important to es-
tablish the contribution of such capabilities in the digital marketing environment from a Zimbabwean context. Aca-
demic research on digital market innovations and market 
performance of agro-processors in Harare is missing. The 
study consider digital market innovation capabilities to 
be a crucial resource as the capabilities are complex, have 
causal ambiguity, are hard to copy and non-transferrable 
thus valuable to small firms. We therefore posit that:
Hypothesis 3: Digital market innovation capabilities 
positively influence agro-processors’ a) intermediate mar -
ket performance outcomes, and b) final market perfor -
mance outcomes.
The fourth capability examined in this study is leader -
ship capability. We consider leadership capability to be the 
ability to lead, manage, motivate, and coordinate activities 
within the organisation. Possession of exceptional human 
capital is not enough, there is need to bring that capital to -
gether to create value in the organisation. Managerial and 
organisational processes in an organisation influence its 
competitive advantage (Teece et al., 1997). Management of 
human capital and its development influence motivation 
and loyalty, which in turn affects strategy implementation. 
Unlike other studies, this study deliberately chose leader -
ship instead of managerial capability because most SMEs 
do not have clear organisational structures that clearly de-
fine management roles. Instead, a bundle of skills is gener -
ally available and the owner usually makes all the strategic 
decisions. As such, it is crucial to refer to capabilities to 
lead and direct all other activities. Therefore, we proposed 
the following:
Hypothesis 4: Leadership capabilities positively influ-
ence agro-processors’ a) intermediate market performance 
outcomes, and b) final market performance outcomes.
2.1. Model overview
Figure 1 shows the model of relations among the vari -
ables. On each variable, the model shows the linkage to 
a) intermediate market outcomes and b) final market 
outcomes. First the model shows the effect of e-market 
sensing capability on intermediate market outcomes (H1a) 
and final market outc omes (H1b). Second, the model de-
picts the effect of digital strategy development & imple-
mentation on intermediate market outcomes (H2a) and 
final market outcomes (H2b). Third, the model shows the Business: Theory and Practice, 2020, 21(2): 746–757 751
effect of digital market innovation on intermediate mar -
ket outcomes (H3a) and final market outcomes (H3b). 
Lastly, the model shows the effect of leadership capability 
on intermediate market outcomes (H4a) and final market 
outcomes (H4b).  In this study, intermediate market out-
comes constituted of awareness, customer attitudes, prod-
uct availability, brand associations, and customer satisfac-
tion whilst final market outcomes are sales growth, market 
share, and profitability. 
3. Methodology
We conducted a cross-sectional survey on 298 SME agro-
processors in Harare, Zimbabwe. A survey was necessary 
because no data was available in public sources for sec-
ondary collection. Although expensive and difficult to col-
lect (Moorman & Day, 2016), primary data remains viable 
option in this study. 
A closed-ended questionnaire was the primary data 
collection tool. We distributed the questionnaire to senior 
marketing executives and owners or other senior manag-
ers in cases where no proper marketing departments ex-
isted. Senior executives were more knowledgeable about 
their marketing capabilities, processes, and performance 
therefore relevant to the survey. We adopted two ap -
proaches depending on respondents’ availability, the inter -
viewer approach and the drop-off and pick-up approach. 
We selected our respondents through two approaches, 
stratified simple random sampling in samples that had a 
well-defined sampling frames, and quota sampling where 
sampling frames were scarce. 
All measures of the capability constructs were meas-
ured on a Likert scale ranging from one to five where one 
represented strongly disagree. Market performance con-
structs were measured on a one to seven Likert scale, and 
respondents judged their performance against the previ-
ous year. This subjective measurement or responses ap-
proach was useful because actual sensitive data could not 
be easily availed. Measures for all constructs were adapt-
ed from previous studies of Morgan et al. (2009), Barrett 
et al. (2015) and Calantone et al. (2002).
We analysed our data using STATA version 15. Initially 
we conducted descriptive analysis, followed by bivariate 
analysis and finally logistic regression to test our hypoth-
esis. The results are in the following section.
3.1. Questionnaire validity
Several approaches were taken to ensure validity of the 
questionnaire since validity issues were central to the de-
velopment and testing of the questionnaire. Validity was 
important in the study as it ensured the questionnaire 
measures what it was intended to measure (Saunders 
et al., 2016, p. 450). Since there is no single objective way 
of verifying what a researcher is measuring (Mooi et al., 
2018), it was necessary to adopt multiple approaches. Wide 
literature review was one key element of our validity ap-
proaches. The wide literature review contributed to clearly defining research constructs. In addition, we sought ex-
pert opinion in the development and testing of the ques-
tionnaire.  Expert opinion contributed to both face va-
lidity (expert validity) and content validity of measures.  
Content validity was essential to ensure the measurement 
questions in the questionnaire delivered adequate cover -
age of the required information needs (Saunders et  al., 
2016, p. 450). Further, we adapted market performance 
measures from O’Sullivan and Abel (2007), Hooley et al. 
(2005), Neely (2007), and Moorman and Day (2016). This 
contributed to construct validity. According to Garson 
(2013) construct validity is questionable if a researcher 
uses constructs that are at odds with literature because 
construct validity is indisputably connected to theory and 
hypothesis (Carmines & Zeller, 1979). Construct validity 
was also measured using Spearman’s correlation.  Before 
implementation, the questionnaire was pilot tested with 
workmates and conveniently selected agro-processors. The 
workmates who were researchers in marketing contribut-
ed to clarity, flow and general design of the questionnaire. 
This was part of face validity which sought to assess if the 
questionnaire made sense. Largely, pilot testing contrib-
utes to validity and reliability (Saunders et al., 2016).  
4. Results
4.1. Descriptive analysis
The results show that 54% of the respondents were male 
whilst 46% were females. Age composition of the respond-
ents stood at 58% of the respondents in the 31–40 year age 
group whilst only 15% where aged 41–50 years. Results in-
dicated that 28% of the respondents use websites and 84% 
did not have one. The majority of respondents, 35% had 
6-10 years of existence in the agro-processing business. 
The results also show that 66% of the agro-processors 
that participated in the survey had 6–50 employees whilst 
34% had 51–100. Food & beverage sector constituted 37% 
of the respondents followed by wood & furniture (34%), 
textiles and clothing (25%) and other (4%). Participants 
responded that they have on average 69% of both digi-
tal market innovation, and leadership capabilities of the 
required digital marketing capabilities. Respondents also 
indicated that they have on average 66% and 63% of digi-
tal strategy development & implementation and e-market 
sensing capabilities respectively. Generally, these results 
show that agro-processors have digital marketing capabili-
ties (average 66.8%) for the execution of digital marketing 
activities.
4.2. Reliability analysis
Table 1 shows the reliability analysis results. The research-
ers used the Cronbach’s alpha index to test whether the 
research instrument (questionnaire) was reliable.  In addi-
tion, the Cronbach’s alpha test provides a guide to whether 
further advanced tests from the data are possible or not 
(Sekeran & Bougie, 2016; Saunders et al., 2016). All con-
structs in this study had Cronbach’s alpha index above 752 M. Chinakidzwa, M. Phiri. Impact of digital marketing capabilities on market performance of small to medium...
0.75 indicating high reliability. The average alpha index 
was 0.895, which allowed the researchers to conduct fur -
ther tests on the data. According to Sekeran and Bougie 
(2016), a Cronbach’s alpha below 0.6 is poor, whilst an 
alpha around 0.7 is acceptable with alpha above 0.8 being 
very good.
4.3. Construct validity 
Construct and criterion related validity was tested using 
Spearman correlation tests. The results showed a statisti-
cally significant association between digital marketing ca-
pabilities (DMC) and intermediate market outcomes (IO) 
and final market outcomes (FO) (p < 0.001). As DMC 
increases, IO and FO increases with correlations 0.350 
and 0.227 respectively. According to Carmines and Zeller 
(1979, p. 23) if correlation results are positive and signifi-
cant then there is evidence to support construct validity. 
Further, correlation contributed to testing criterion-relat-
ed validity. Correlation had the power to tell if a variable 
predicted or was a valid measure for predicting market 
performance. According to Carmines and Zeller (1979, 
p. 18) variables that correlate highly predict outcomes bet-
ter therefore are a good and valid measure. However, to 
achieve discriminant validity (Bagozzi et al., 1991) valid 
measures of unique concepts should not relate too highly. 
In this study, correlations were low therefore achieved 
discriminant validity. Overall, putting together validity 
approaches adopted in the entire methodology, the study 
was justifiably valid.
4.4. Associations between digital marketing 
capabilities and market performance (t-tests)
4.4.1. Digital marketing capabilities and intermediate 
outcomes 
The results of t-tests showed that there was a difference 
in digital market innovation capabilities between those 
respondents >50% intermediate outcomes and <50% 
outcomes (p < 0.001), among those with >50% outcome 
they had 75% of the required digital market innovation 
capabilities compared to 40% among those with <50% 
income.  There was also a difference in leadership capa-
bilities between respondents who attained >50% outcomes 
and <50% outcomes (p < 0.001), among those with >50% outcomes they had 75% of the required leadership capa-
bilities compared to 39% among those with <50% income. 
Differences between respondents >50% income and <50% 
income (p < 0.001) were also found in digital strategy de-
velopment & execution and e-market sensing capabilities. 
Overall these results show that differences in digital mar -
keting capabilities influence agro-processors’ intermediate 
market performance outcomes.
4.4.2. Digital marketing capabilities and final market 
outcomes
There was a difference in leadership capabilities between 
those respondents >50% outcomes and <50% outcome 
(p < 0.001), among those with >50% final-outcomes they 
had 75% of the required leadership capabilities compared 
to 50% among those with <50% income. Results also indi-
cated differences in digital market innovation capabilities 
between respondents >50% outcomes and <50% outcomes 
(p < 0.001), among those with >50% outcomes they had 
75% of the required digital market innovation capabili-
ties compared to 50% among those with <50% outcomes. 
Other differences where in digital strategy development 
& execution capabilities between those respondents >50% 
outcomes and <50% outcomes (p < 0.001), among those 
with >50% outcomes they had 72% of the required digital 
strategy development & execution capabilities compared 
to 50% among those with <50% final-outcomes. Finally, 
results indicated differences in e-market sensing capa-
bilities between respondents >50% final market outcomes 
and <50% market outcomes (p < 0.001), among those with 
>50% outcomes they had 70% of the required e-market 
sensing capabilities compared with 42% among those with 
<50% final market outcomes. These results shows that dif-
ferences in digital marketing capabilities influence agro-
processors’ final market performance outcomes.

final market performance outcomes. On the linkage be-
tween digital marketing capabilities and market perfor -
mance, the results showed that there was a statistically 
significant association between intermediate market out-
comes and leadership capabilities after adjusting for other 
study variable (p = 0.002), for a unit increase in leadership 
capabilities score, the odds of obtaining >50% intermedi-
ate market outcomes increases by 17%. This means agro-
processors are expected to witness increased intermediate 
market performance outcomes by 17% for every increase 
or improvement in leadership capabilities. Digital market 
innovation capabilities also had a significant association 
with intermediate market outcomes after adjusting for 
other study variables (p = 0.005), for a unit increase in 
digital market innovation capabilities score, the odds of 
getting >50% increases by 52%. This result means that 
an increase or improvement in digital market innovation 
capabilities is expected to result in a 52% increase of in-
termediate market performance outcomes. Digital market 
innovations therefore contributes the most to agro-pro-
cessors’ market performance. There was also a significant 
association between intermediate-outcomes and e-market 
sensing capabilities after adjusting for other study vari-
ables (p = 0.009), and for a unit increase in e-market sens-
ing capabilities score, the odds of getting >50% decreases 
by 23%. The result means that although e-market sensing 
capabilities positively contribute to intermediate market 
performance, agro-processors’ market performance out-
comes are expected to decrease by 23% for every increase 
or improvement in e-market sensing capabilities. For 
digital strategy development and execution capabilities, 
the results showed that there was a statistically significant 
association between intermediate market outcomes and 
strategy development and execution  after adjusting for 
other study variables (p = 0.005), for a unit increase in 
digital strategy development and execution capabilities 
score, the odds of obtaining >50% outcomes reduced by 
30%. Therefore the results support all the hypothesis (H1a, 
H2a, H3a, and H4a) that linked digital marketing capabili -
ties to intermediate market performance outcomes.
On the linkage between digital marketing capabili-
ties and final market performance outcomes, the results 
showed that there was a statistically significant association 
between final market performance outcomes and digital 
strategy development and execution capabilities after 
adjusting for other study variable (p = 0.019), for a unit 
increase in digital strategy development and execution ca-
pabilities score, the odds of obtaining >50% decreases by 
11%. Therefore the results supported only hypothesis 2b.
Discussions and conclusions
The findings indicate that only 28% of agro-processors 
who participated in the survey have websites whilst 72% 
do not have. The results show a low website usage com-
pared to existing research, which show that 60% of small 
business globally do not have websites (Nordahl, 2017 cited by Charlesworth, 2018). The low website uptake is 
contrary to findings that websites are part of the most 
used digital channels in SMEs (Heini & Heikki, 2015). 
In the UK, about 2million, small businesses were found 
to be operating without websites yet websites could im-
prove their revenues (Enterprise Management, 360, 2017). 
These results strengthen the argument that majority of 
SMEs utilised digital marketing poorly compared to big 
organisations (Heini & Heikki, 2015; Gilmore et al., 2007). 
Although the study found male respondents (54%), domi-
nating compared to women (46%), previous research by 
FinScope (2012) found 53% of women to be engaged in 
agro-processing compared to 47% of men. The current 
study considered only participants who were in marketing 
executive positions or related, thus potentially excluding 
other women. However, the results shows that agro-pro-
cessing provides a source of income to women (Ampadu-
Ameyaw & Omari, 2015), constituting 59% of respondents 
in the 18–30 age group of this study. This implies women 
are getting into executive positions early than their male 
counterparts.
Results of the logistic regression shows significant 
associations between all tested digital marketing capa-
bilities and intermediate market outcomes. This means 
agro-processors in Harare have the abilities and skills to 
convert their resources and execute digital marketing ac-
tivities that create awareness, positive brand attitudes, and 
associations among other intermediate market outcomes. 
However, only digital strategy development and execution 
capabilities provided statistical evidence of significant as-
sociation to final market performance outcomes of sales 
growth, profitability and market share. These findings are 
contrary to previous research that concluded that SMEs 
(agro-processors included) lack market information, in-
telligence, and market sensing capabilities (Gilmore et al., 
2007; Mhazo et al., 2012; Heini & Heikki, 2015). Findings 
of this study support the capability approach that capa-
bilities contribute to market performance, unlike market-
ing resources or assets, capabilities offer superior perfor -
mance opportunities.  The confirmation of hypothesis 1a 
that, “digital strategy development and execution capabili-
ties positively influence intermediate market performance 
outcomes” is encouraging. This means agro-processors 
are developing and implementing digital strategies that 
are profitable in the sense that they are creating customer 
awareness, positive brand associations, positive attitudes, 
and availability of products and services. This a positive 
development considering that the Zimbabwean environ-
ment is very dynamic. This result confirms that agro-pro-
cessors in Harare are able to design, and execute profitable 
digital marketing strategies.  The findings support exist -
ing literature that strategy development and implementa-
tion capabilities influence market performance (Vorhies 
& Morgan, 2005). Organisations that fail to define clearly 
their strategies miss opportunities, and waste resources 
(Chaffey, 2015). In a study to assess adoption of online 
banking in Malaysia, Abdullah et  al. (2019) found that 754 M. Chinakidzwa, M. Phiri. Impact of digital marketing capabilities on market performance of small to medium...
e-strategy influence customer perceptions on intention to 
adopt online banking.
In addition, results of this study support the hypoth-
esis that, “digital market innovation capabilities positively 
influence intermediate market performance outcomes”. This 
means agro-processors in Harare are finding value in their 
pursuit of innovation capabilities. The results support 
findings of Barrett et al. (2015) that firms in developing 
markets innovate regardless of resource deficiences. The 
evidence of positive associations between leadership ca-
pabilities and intermediate market outcomes might signal 
that agro-processors in Harare have strong human capital. 
Although human capital is not enough on its own, it pro-
vides a strong base to build effective leadership capabilities 
(Teece et al., 1997). Corporate culture of SMEs is usually 
dominated by cultural perceptions and values of the own-
er or shareholders who tend to have more influence than 
in large corporates (Lynch, 2015). In some instances, these 
SMEs are owner managed, as such leadership capabilities 
become a key driver to success. The results affirms that 
agro-processors in Harare are able to bring together their 
human capital to coordinate, lead activities and processes 
in their organisations. 
The final revelation that “e-market sensing capabili-
ties positively influence intermediate market performance 
outcomes” is a positive outcome in the agro-processors 
capabilities research. Contrary to previous findings that 
agro-processors are not able to gather market intelligence 
(Zindiye et al., 2012) the study reveals that agro-proces -
sors are engaging in e-market sensing and benefiting from 
such capabilities. The power of digital technologies that 
agro-processors are implementing potentially explain this 
shift. Digital media facilitate easy market intelligence at 
a low cost (Charlesworth, 2018) thus reducing cost pres-
sures for SMEs (Heini & Heikki, 2015). However, results 
testing the influence of digital marketing capabilities on 
final market outcomes support only one hypothesis that, 
“digital strategy development and execution capabilities pos-
itively influence final market performance outcomes” . This 
implies that strategy development and implementation is 
critical to agro-processors. Capabilities remain valuable 
to Harare agro-processors though considering that they 
influence intermediate outcomes.
The study found that all the four digital marketing ca-
pabilities (strategy development & execution, innovation, 
leadership, and e-market sensing) to positively influence 
intermediate market performance measures. As such, the 
researchers concluded that digital marketing capabilities 
in agro-processors have a positive influence on intermedi-
ate market outcomes. However, only digital strategy devel-
opment & execution capabilities showed positive influence 
on final market performance outcomes. We conclude that 
only digital strategy development and execution give agro-
processors positive final market performance outcomes of 
profitability, market share and sales growth. Although the 
other capabilities are good for intermediate outcomes, 
they do not directly influence final performance measures. These conclusions imply that agro-processors must build 
digital marketing capabilities to improve both intermedi-
ate and final market performance outcomes. While inter -
mediate market outcomes influence final market outcomes 
(Clark, 2007), there is need for identification and devel-
opment of capabilities that directly influence final market 
performance outcomes. 
Limitations and further research
The researchers acknowledges some limitations to this 
study. Market performance studies are difficult to con-
clude in cross-sectional surveys. It is often difficult for a 
research to delineate cause and effect of interventions in a 
cross sectional study. In the context of the current study, 
it was impossible to link objectively identified market per -
formance outcomes to digital marketing capabilities. As 
such, the researchers relied on subjective measures. Al-
though, the researchers sought responses from two senior 
executives, the approach still give problems as judgements 
always differ. The use of a questionnaire as the sole data 
collection instrument brings weaknesses to the study. 
The questionnaire did not give the researchers a chance 
to probe certain responses especially in cases where the 
senior executives had tight schedules and requested to 
complete the questionnaire at their own time. The ques-
tionnaire itself was long (10-pages) for respondents to re-
main focussed on the questions. The researchers identified 
lack of concentration in the last segment where tendencies 
of straight lining were high. In addition, lack of complete 
sampling frame was a limitation to the study. The mixed 
sampling approached posed challenges of identifying 
respondents in sectors that had no complete sampling 
frames. The researchers developed constructs for this 
study from non-digital marketing resources and capability 
studies. The lack of existing well-defined constructs that 
the researchers could test or extend to the agro-processing 
sector posed a limitation of generalisability. 
For future research, while intermediate outcomes in-
fluence final market outcomes, there is need to link scien-
tifically the two outcomes. For example, how much aware -
ness is required to create a certain level of sales growth? 
Marketing researchers must test capabilities identified in 
this study in other markets and contexts. More research 
is required in the digital marketing capability area since 
the application of established capability frameworks has 
contextual limitations. More still, there is no agreement 
among scholars on resource and capability definitions, 
classifications and impact to market performance.  There 
is need for more research that employ new marketing re-
search techniques such as experimentation. Researchers 
must adopt more scientific, robust and objective means 
of establishing the cause and effect relationship between 
capabilities and market performance. Such studies can 
benefit from employing longitudinal perspectives so that 
researchers capture effects over a long period. In addi-
tion, studies of this nature must capture both objective Business: Theory and Practice, 2020, 21(2): 746–757 755
and subjective data. By so doing researchers eliminate bias 
of both respondents and the researcher.  Overall, there is 
need for more research in developing markets particularly 
in the African context that focus on digital marketing ca-
pabilities, activities, and market performance. Knowledge 
development in the digital marketing space is weak and 
the gap continue to grow with every technological devel-
opment.
