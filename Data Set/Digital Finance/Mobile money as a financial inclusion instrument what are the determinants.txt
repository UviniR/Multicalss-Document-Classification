Abstract
Purpose –This paper seeks to examine the motivating factors that propel people to use mobile money in the
Greater Accra Region (GAR) of Ghana. The authors posit that the behaviour of a person, in terms of the choiceand means of transaction, cannot be explained solely by utility-maximizing assumptions or rationality. Thus,
other socio-cultural and psychological factors are crucial in determining whether a person will use
mobile money.
Design/methodology/approach –This study uses a cross-sectional design to obtain primary data on 733
households from the GAR of Ghana to determine the drivers of mobile money use. Given the binary nature of
the dependent variable, a logit model and its marginal effects are estimated. Furthermore, parametric and non-parametric statistical tests are used to examine gender effect and mobile money use.
Findings –The study finds that technology savvy cohorts (youthful age cohorts), available services such as
phone credit recharge, education and income are among the key determinants of mobile money use in Ghana.Furthermore, parametric and non-parametric tests of mobile money use on gender show a statistically
significant difference in gender use of mobile money, albeit, marginal. The findings imply that consistent use of
mobile money to access social and economic services can go a long way in promoting financial inclusion,financial empowerment and general wellbeing of people.
Originality/value –Households in developing countries especially Ghana have rapidly embraced mobile
money technology. However, what determines the household level of adoption, to the best of our knowledge, isunknown and yet to be tested. This study bridges that gap in the empirical literature as well as contributes to
policy decisions.

1. Introduction
The rapid growth of mobile technology and innovation in the 21st century has brought about
a wide range of options to consumers in undertaking cashless transactions ( Maurer, 2012 ).
These developments have spread globally with some key success ongoing in Africa,
especially in Ghana where several electronic payment platforms (mobile money, e-zwich,
VISA, Mastercard, etc.) are now common ( Ozyurt and Beck, 2019 ). Since 2018, the central
bank in collaboration with several institutions and stakeholders has developed mobile money
interoperability to deepen financial inclusion, especially among the non-banked population
within the informal sector. Through this enhanced platform, users of mobile money can now
undertake transactions across telecommunication network providers as well as connect their
mobile money accounts with their traditional bank accounts, all at a reduced cost. The
International Finance Corporation (2018) market overview on Ghana reveals that mobile
money wallets have become a common, attractive and growing means of payments for utility
bills, treasury bills, salaries, wholesale and retail trading in goods, insurance, etc.
In as much as mobile money facilitates financial inclusion and convenience in
transactions, it comes with challenges such as security, regulation, adaptation, illiteracyThe use of

DOI10.1108/IJSE-05-2020-0271and network charges which can limit its overall acceptance and use in Ghana. Securing
payments and receipts using mobile wallets, with end-to-end-encryption is not yet
guaranteed, creating room for fraudulent opportunities. Regulation and monitoring of such
transactions are not directly within the jurisdiction of monetary authorities, hence creating
mistrust. Engaging and retaining the trust of customers, particularly those who are poor and
new to the technology, is vital to success ( Donovan, 2012 ). In addition, the technological
knowledge required to get familiarized with such platforms is not yet ubiquitous among all
categories of the population, especially the aged and less educated.
Despite these, payment system statistics of the Bank of Ghana (2019) show that mobile
money accounts are mainly used for transferring funds among users, with the total value of
all transactions reaching $46bn in 2018, representing 69% of nominal GDP in the same fiscal
year. In Ghana, such transfers attract two kinds of charges, which both the sender and the
receiver must pay. The first is a network charge of 1%, which is calculated based on the total
amount transferred from one account into another. Next is an additional 1% charge, which
the receiver pays, depending on the total amount to be withdrawn from their wallet.
Therefore, the charges are positively correlated with the total amount transferred or
withdrawn.
Such charges do no deter people from using the mobile money service and the evidence
suggests that the craze for its adoption is still on the ascendency in Ghana. Recent data from
the Bank of Ghana show that from 2012 to 2018, registered mobile money accounts and
agents increased drastically in cumulative terms by about 762 and 4,480%, respectively.
Within the same period, mobile money accounts and agents also rose by about 3,680 and
216%, respectively. Between the first quarters of 2018 and 2019, registered mobile money
accounts and agents grew by about 17 and 63% in that order and that of active mobile money
accounts and agents grew at the same rate by about 13%.
With such staggering adoption rates, this paper examines the motivating factors that
propel people to use mobile money transactions over traditional and other e-money services
in the Greater Accra Region (GAR) of Ghana. We posit that the behaviour of a person, in terms
of the choice and means of transaction, cannot be explained solely by utility-maximizing
assumptions or rationality. This suggests that other social, cultural and psychological factors
are crucial in determining whether an individual will prefer mobile money over others.
Following Onel and Mukherjee (2016) , we hypothesize that the youthful and literate cohorts of
the population are more likely to use mobile money because they are the technology savvycohorts. In addition, we argue that age and gender explain the choice of medium for
undertaking financial transaction, in line with earlier studies that show that being older or
female drives pro-environmental behaviour, which is associated with using eco-friendly
cashless transaction such as mobile money (see e.g. Kollmuss; Agyeman, 2002 ;S/C19anchez et al.,
2016;Blankenberg; Alhusen, 2018 ). This study therefore seeks to investigate how rationality
within the theory of consumer behaviour, intention of actions within the theory of planned
behaviour, and adaptation within technological innovation acceptance or adoption theory
influence mobile money use.
The paper is unique in several aspects. First, we use a cross-sectional study design to
obtain primary data on participants in the GAR of Ghana. It also attempts to explore the
determinants of mobile money use among rising middle-class population in Ghana from
social, cultural, economic and psychological perspectives. Finally, it contributes to bridging
the gap in academic literature by extending the scope of empirical study in financial inclusion
and the role of financial innovations.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section two presents related theoretical and
empirical literature. Section three describes the research approach and design while Section
four analyses and discusses the results. Section five presents the summary, conclusion and
recommendation.IJSE2. Review of previous studies
2.1 Theoretical review
Innovation and technology fit into the normal cycle of human behaviour. Indeed, some key
theories have been developed to explain why and how innovation and technology are adopted
or accepted as part of human life. For instance, the theory of reasoned action, theory of
planned behaviour and the technology acceptance model are important theoretical
explanations of the role of innovative technologies like mobile banking in modern life
(Nguena, 2019 ). In addition, other theories such as Rogers ’diffusion of innovation ( Rogers,
1995), unified theory of acceptance and use of technology and contextual factors of
technology acceptance, explain the motivating factors that encourage people to use and
accept new technology ( Charness and Boot, 2016 ;Barnard et al., 2013;Caine et al., 2006)[1].
However, out of all these theories, the technology acceptance model is the best fit for this
empirical study. The model is credited to the seminal work of Davis (1989) , which suggests
that two main factors influence a person ’s intention to use new technology: perceived ease of
use and perceived usefulness ( Charness and Boot, 2016 ). This suggests that people are more
likely to accept and use technology when they deem it to be easy to use and useful in their
daily activities. These attributes are the grounds on which mobile money technology has
been advertised, thus contributing to its fast penetration rate in the informal sector in
developing countries like Ghana. Following this theoretical position, it is expected that mobile
based technology in modern times will be accepted and adopted easily by younger residents,
because they can easily grasp the usefulness of new technology.
Many other recent studies have used the technology acceptance model to examine human
interaction with technology. However, not many studies focus on technologies like mobile
money in Ghana. At best, studies such as Okocha and Adibi (2020) andAsnakew (2020) focus
on mobile banking technologies for business executives and consumers of formal banking
products. This leaves a gap in the academic literature on financial inclusion and the role of
financial innovations like informal mobile technologies, to which further empirical work like
this is contributed.
2.2 Empirical review
Mobile “money ”and the associated financial services are regarded as some of the most
promising services in developing countries ( Donovan, 2012 ). Mobile money technology and
its use in developing countries capture two relevant issues in the development literature. In
several respects, the determinants of the choice for mobile money technology adoption can be
analyzed in light of the determinants of financial inclusion and financial innovations in
developing countries. Therefore, mobile money technology highlights the importance of
innovations in the financial industry that can help improve financial inclusion, especially of
low-income earners in developing countries.
First, regarding the determinants of financial inclusion, recent studies such as Irankunda
and Van Bergeijk (2019) show that social factors such as gender and the location of financial
services strongly influence financial inclusion in a developing country like Uganda. The
study focuses on transactions of low-income earners in Uganda. The study also controlled for
other demographic factors such as age, marital status and the level of education. The findings
showed that the education level of respondents was positively related to the level of financial
inclusion, suggesting that respondents who were more educated were more likely to be
financially inclusive.
Other studies like Mushtaq and Bruneau (2019) also highlight the positive influence of
information and communication technologies (ICTs) like mobile banking on household
welfare and poverty reduction. As an excellent option for accelerating financial inclusion,
mobile banking can connect people in remote areas, thus confirming the importance of
location as a determinant of financial inclusion ( Mishra and Bisht, 2013 ). Several other studiesThe use of
mobile money
in the GAR of
Ghanaalso confirm that mobile banking technology is a powerful instrument, which enhances
financial inclusion and is mainly used by low-income earners in rural communities ( Pradhan
et al., 2015 ;Sassi and Goaied, 2013 ;Vu, 2011 ;Mbiti and Weil, 2011 ;Shamim, 2007 ).
Furthermore, Soumare et al. (2016) examine the determinants of financial inclusion in
Central and West Africa. The findings of this study are similar to findings of the earlier
literature, because individual characteristics such as gender, age, education, income,
residence area, marital status and employment status are considered as key determinants of
financial inclusion in the central and western sub-regions of the African continent. In addition
to these, other factors such as the size of the household and the degree of trust in financial
institutions are identified as social factors that influence financial inclusion in the two
regions. Earlier studies such as Demirguc-Kunt and Klapper (2012a ,b)also confirm that
individual characteristics such as income, education and degree of trust are determinants of
financial inclusion in Africa. These determinants influence the choice for financial services
such as bank account transfers, credit union transactions or mobile phone banking. In most
cases, the choice of financial service is influenced by low account management costs,
geographical access of financial intermediaries and less strict document requirements during
account setup ( Allen et al., 2012 ). Similarly, Beck and Cull (2013) emphasize the importance of
financial innovations like mobile banking because it presents an opportunity for many people
in the informal sector, with low incomes, to have access to financial services at lower costs.
Klapper and Singer (2015) confirm this position in the literature by investigating the informal
methods used for borrowing and savings in African countries. Their results also show that
financial inclusion is enhanced with financial innovations like mobile money, which allow the
middle-aged, women, the poor, less educated, rural settlers and the unemployed to access
financial services at their convenience. These results are also consistent with findings of
earlier studies that show that demographic and social characteristics of people contribute to
financial inclusion in developing countries.
Second, the success of mobile money in developing countries also highlights the
importance of financial innovations and the need to understand the determinants of such
financial innovation in developing countries. This is because it is more likely that the
determinants of financial inclusion are similar to the determinants of financial innovation,
given the positive contributions that mobile phone banking has on inequality and poverty
reduction in developing countries. In addition, the determinants of financial innovations like
mobile money in Africa also include macroeconomic variables like human capitaldevelopment, accommodative monetary policy, openness to trade, gross capital formation
and credit from the baking sector ( Nguena, 2019 ). Mobile phone banking technology has
grown at a fast pace in African countries and has become a necessity for most people in
African countries because its penetration mitigates inequality in the informal financial sector
(Asongu, 2013 ).
Compared to earlier financial innovati o n sl i k et h ec h i pa n dp i nb a n kc a r d sa n d
automatic teller machines (ATMs), mobile phone banking technology has contributed
significantly to financial inclusion of t he informal sector in developing countries ( Donner,
2008 ). Earlier financial innovations had been more focused on formal sector dynamics and
were targeted mainly at improving environmental conditions, enhancing the customer
experience, enhancing technology diffusion within upper and middle-income brackets and
improving products, processes and o rganizational performance [ 2](Frame and White,
2004 ). Even so, not much literature exists on the de terminants of financial innovations and
those that existed focused on earlier technol ogies that could improve banking and business
in the formal sector, way before mobile money was launched ( Arhavein et al., 2005 ;Frame
and Woosley, 2004 ;Berger et al., 2005 ;Cornett
et al. ,2 0 0 2 ;Schroth, 2006 ;Lerner, 2002 ;
Mantel and McHugh, 2001 ).IJSE2.3 empirical literature on mobile money
Many empirical studies generally portray mobile money as beneficial for the social and
economic development of African people, particularly those with low and medium incomes.
Recent studies such as Riley (2018) have examined how mobile money helps to reduce the
impact of rainfall shocks such as flooding or drought on households that have access to
mobile money services in villages or rural communities. The paper focuses on examining the
impact of mobile money services on both mobile money users and households not using
mobile money services, following a rainfall shock. This method allowed the researcher to
assess the degree to which remittances obtained through mobile money were spread within
the villages, thereby reducing the risk to community households. The research found that
only mobile money users could prevent a decrease in their consumption after a rainfall shock,
with no spillover impact on other village members.
There is also evidence that mobile money has had a huge effect on poverty reduction and
the development of women ’s health in rural communities. According to Suri and Jack (2016) ,
access to mobile money services in Kenya [ 3] has increased consumption levels per capita and
lifted more than 100,000 households out of poverty. The paper argues that these mobile
money effects are seen more strongly in female-headed households, which display signs of a
shift in financial behaviour in terms of financial resilience rates, savings and buying
decisions. The study concludes that mobile money has had a long-term impact on household
consumption in Kenya and has affected labor allocation and poverty rates in the country.
Similarly, Adaba et al. (2018) focused on the effect of mobile money on the health and
wellbeing of residents in Ghana ’s Upper East region. The paper uses a qualitative study
approach and gathers data through organized interviews with mobile money operators as
well as consumers in three towns in the Upper East —Bolgatanga, Zebilla and Tongo. The
paper concluded that most people had enjoyed the benefits of using mobile money, although
some people suffered problems with the service (poor network coverage and inadequate
energy infrastructure). These benefits include the incentive to participate in the financial
system, improved capacity to manage family and personal commitments and motivate
respondents to make purchasing decisions for themselves and their companies.
In addition, Dong et al. (2018) focus on the effects of mobile money services on the value
chain, made up of mobile network providers, banks and end users. The analysis uses both
primary and secondary data to determine the effect of mobile money and potential impacts
from credit transactions on the value chain. The paper shows that the mobile money businesshas a positive impact on the productivity of the value chain, and these effects are constant
over time.
Amid these, mobile money ’s optimistic effects are not absolutely robust ( Aron, 2018 ). For
example, Cobla and Osei-Assibey (2017) argued that while mobile money supported students ’
financial purchasing decisions, it risked increasing student spending behaviour and lowering
the savings trend among these groups of individuals. Again, Akomea-Frimpong et al. (2019)
claim that Ghana ’s mobile money is being used to facilitate fraud due to inadequate internal
controls and processes, the lack of advanced detection software and the lack of
comprehensive education on service use. Their paper suggests that service providers
could combat the mobile money service ’s fraud-related issues by establishing a fraud
strategy that merchants and partner banks should follow, while merchants receive training in
public relations that can promote mass public education.
Although all these studies examine mobile money technology and adaption, studies that
focus on the factors that compel people to use mobile money are rare, leaving a gap in the
academic literature on mobile money in African developing countries. This study attempts to
contribute to filling this gap by presenting empirical evidence on the factors that influence
citizens ’choice for mobile money in the GAR of Ghana.The use of
mobile money
in the GAR of
Ghana3. Methodology
3.1 Fieldwork processes
In Ghana, the mobile money adoption craze started in the urban areas before finally trickling
down to the rural areas. One of such areas is the GAR, which is predominantly an urban area
and is the capital city of Ghana. In line with the last (i.e. 2010) Population and Housing Census
by the Ghana Statistical Service (2012) , the region was reported to have a total number of
1,036,426 households (urban and rural). To ensure a representative sample, we used the basic
formula of Yamane (1967) for computing the sample size, which yielded approximately 400
households. Given that for sample size, the-bigger the-better, we oversampled and used a
sample size of 733 households. To obtain this, each municipal area was sub-divided into their
respective strata (geographically identified communities). In each stratum, the housing units
were listed by the fieldworkers and randomly selected for the survey. This sampling
technique suggests that the sample was obtained using stratified random sampling.
The researchers employed 15 field assistants to assist in the data collection. This
comprises of three field coordinators and 12 data collectors who were all trained for the
data collection and observation of standard ethical and cultural issues relevant to the
research. The field coordinators were hired based on their experience in fieldwork and
supervision of fieldworkers. Each coordinator was supposed to supervise four data
collectors, so that each group consisted of one coordinator and four data collectors. In
addition, the data collectors were people who had completed secondary school and could
speak any of the common languages needed to interact with the households. The
researchers maintained an overarching oversight responsibility over the coordinators, data
collectors and all activities of the data collection from the commencement of the data
collection until the end.
Using a survey approach, the main instrument used for the data collection was a well-
structured questionnaire. The questionnaire was designed to follow the format used by the
Ghana Statistical Service. It was tested in a pilot survey with the help of field assistants
following successful training sessions. The needed amendments were made before the
commencement of the survey. The final draft of the survey instrument was peer reviewed by
an additional team of researchers and survey experts. During the administration of the
questionnaire, the coordinators were supposed to vet all questionnaires they collated from the
data collectors before they were given their remuneration. There was no single case where the
data collectors were denied their honorarium for poor work done. All vetted collatedquestionnaires were considered fit for use in the analysis.
Several data collection approaches have been suggested in the literature. However, this
study employs the face-to-face approach given its relative strength of high response rate. Lo,
the study recorded a high response rate of 98%. This is a common feature of most surveys in
Ghana particularly in the GAR. Respondents were randomly drawn and incentivized with
mobile phone credit worth GHS five. Most respondents sent messages to acknowledge receipt
of the credit and showed appreciation for the kind gesture. Examples of such messages
include “medaase ”to wit “Thank you ”,“you’ve made my day ”among others.
The survey questionnaire included two key sections that informed this study. For
simplicity, we summarize the questionnaire in relation to this study according to the two key
sections: socio-economic characteristics of respondents and mobile money as financial
inclusion related questions. The question used in teasing out the key research question was
“whether the respondent use mobile money or not ”. Responses confirming the use of mobile
money by the respondents were coded as 1, otherwise coded as 0. The respondents were given
the opportunity to either say “I won ’t answer ”,“I can ’t tell ”or“I refuses to answer ”.I n
addition, respondents were permitted to withdraw consent and exit the interview if they felt
unease to continue. That is, all respondents voluntarily and willingly provided the responses
without compulsion whatsoever.IJSEIn the second stage, another team of experts were hired to assist in the data entry. All
responses were entered under the supervision of the researchers. The researchers, after the
data entry, used the unique identifier to match the entries. This enabled the team to
crosscheck the entries to ensure that they were the same as what has been indicated on the
questionnaire. In addition, using STATA 14, the researchers did the data cleaning to ensure
that the data was ready for use. Further analysis and discussion of results were all
undertaken by the researchers. The data collection period, started from April 1, 2019 and
ended one the April 30, 2019.
3.2 Model specification
Following the binary nature of the dependent variable, we specify a logit model. Following
Gujarati (1995) andAmoah and Addoah (2020) , our model starts with a linear probability
model, as shown in equation (1) below:
Pi¼EðY¼1jXiÞ¼α1þα2Xi (1)
Where Xrepresents the vector of socio-economic covariates, while Y¼1 is the expected
probability that the respondent uses mobile money. We re-write equation (1) to take the
following representation
Pi¼EðY¼1jXiÞ¼1
1þe−ðα1þα2XiÞ(2)
Given that βi¼α1þα2Xi,equation (2) is simplified to take a cumulative logistic distribution
form:
Pi¼EðY¼1jXiÞ¼1
1þe−ðβ1Þ¼eβ
1þeβ(3)
Next, we specify the probability of not using a mobile money or the technology as:
1/C0Pi¼1
1þeβi(4)
Now, we present the odd ratio in favor of using mobile money. This is expressed as the ratio of
using mobile money to the probability that the respondent is not using mobile money. This is
specified as:
Pi
1/C0Pi¼1þeβi
1þe−βi¼eβi (5)
To transform the exponential function, we take the natural log to yield:
Li¼ln/C18Pi
1/C0Pi/C19
¼βi¼α1þα2Xi (6)
Equation (6) shows a linear expression that is both linear in variables as well as in parameters.
In addition, we follow Amoah et al. (2017) to specify the marginal effect as:
vβðyjxÞ
vðxÞ¼/C20vFðα0xÞ
vðα0xÞ/C21
α
For estimation purposes, we re-write equation (6) to include the covariates and an error term.
This is shown that in equation (7) .

of awareness in new technology use or adoption. Income represents the income dynamics of
the respondent and is measured in Ghana cedis (GHS). This variable captures the
contribution of the purchasing power of the respondent whiles its coefficient shows the extent
to which income influences mobile money use. MSis marital status, which seeks to measure
the role of respondents ’status on the use of mobile money technology. HHis household size,
which measures the extent to which different (larger or smaller) household size can influence

4. Results and discussion
We commence our analysis with the descriptive statistics of the variables used for the model
estimation in Table 1 . The dependent variable was obtained by asking the respondents
whether they use mobile money ( Momo ) or not. Initial descriptive statistics showed that on
average, 67% of respondents indicated that, yes, they use mobile money, as opposed to 33%
of respondents, who indicated that they do not use mobile money. This supports the
argument that there is high patronage of mobile money business in Ghana. Recent data from
the Bank of Ghana has shown that from 2013 to 2017, subscription to mobile money services
grew from 4.3 million users to over 23 million users. Based on the drive for financial inclusion
at the governmental level and recent incentive packages (access to loans, interest on deposit,
payment of bills etc.) available to users, it stands to reason that mobile money use is likely to
grow beyond 25 million in 2020.
First, Ageis measured as age of completed years of the respondent. The respondents ’ages
ranged from 18 years to 81 years, with a mean age of about 35 years. Recharge is a categorical
variable that represents the options available to mobile phone users in recharging their
mobile credit. In order of coding, these include using mobile money (1), using physical cash to
buy recharge cards (2) or other payment methods (3) like credit transfers, third party
applications, etc. The mean value of approximately 2, suggests that buying recharge card is
still dominant when people are recharging their mobile credit in Ghana. Next, Education is a
dummy variable to determine whether the respondent is educated or not. This was coded as
one for educated respondents and 0 for uneducated respondents. Consistent with national
data, majority of the respondents were found to be educated while a very small fraction of
them were found to be uneducated.

Descriptive statisticsIJSERegarding the gender of respondents, Males (54%) dominated the sample of respondents
as compared to females (46%). This is a clear characteristic of most Ghanaian communities
where the males dominate as household heads or representatives. Again, the results also
showed that the average take-home income of respondents was Ghs1093.97/month, with a
minimum of Ghs145/month and a maximum of Ghs6200/month. This gives a reasonable
spread of different classes of income groupings in the dataset. Furthermore, approximately
64% the respondents were married while the average household size of about 4.7, is very close
to the national estimate of 4.4 ( GSS, 2012 ).
We then undertake some diagnostic tests that are relevant to cross-sectional data analysis.
The two common identification problems considered in cross-sectional data analysis are
multicollinearity and heteroscedasticity. The pairwise correlation matrix presented in
Table 2 , shows the degree of correlation amongst the variables. The lowest correlation
coefficient of 0.00128 (app. 0.13%) is between gender and marital status (MS), while the
highest correlation coefficient of 0.5053 (app. 51%) is between MS and age. Although some
degree of correlation exists amongst all variables, we argue that the highest correlation
coefficient is not severe to bias the precision of our estimates.
In order to control for possible heteroscedasticity in the model, we estimated the models
with robust standard errors. In addition, we included the district specific effect to control for
possible biases because of differences in the districts included in the study (see model two in
Table 3 below). Against this background, we are confident that our results are not prone to
the biases that result because of these identification challenges.
We used the logit regression, given that the dependent variable is binary, as can be seen in
Table 3 . However, for simplicity of our analysis, we further estimated the marginal effects
using this margins command in Stata 14. We interpreted the margin estimates because these
were more consistent with probability theory and were easy to interpret statistically. That is,
the margins give the derivative of the probability that the dependent variable equals one with
respect to a conditioning variable. Therefore, the estimated margins coefficient for each
variable represents that the likelihood or probability that the dependent variable will be true,
holding all other factors constant.
Our results first show that the age of respondents is negatively related to mobile money
use. The mean of age shows a technologically savvy cohort (youthful and inclined to working
with computer systems). The results are consistent with theoretical expectations regarding
faster technology adaption of the younger cohort of respondents. From Table 3 , the results
suggest that older respondents are less likely to use mobile money as compared to the
respondents in younger age brackets, who are technologically savvy. That is, if age increases
by 1 year, the probability of using mobile money will decrease by 0.26%, ceteris paribus . This
negative coefficient is found to be marginally statistically significant.

Pairwise correlation
matrix testThe use of
mobile money
in the GAR of
GhanaIntuitively, one would expect that mobile money users are more likely to use mobile money to
recharge their mobile credit as compared to non-mobile money users. Physical cash and other
methods are found to be negative relative to respondents who use mobile money to recharge.The parameter estimate for physical cash is approximately /C00.38, implying that if those who
use physical cash should increase by one person, the probability of using mobile money will
decrease by about 38%. The parameter estimate for other methods is approximately /C00.45,
suggesting that if those who use other methods to recharge their mobile phones should
increase by one person, the probability of using mobile money will decrease by about 45%,
ceteris paribus . Our results suggest that relative to those who use mobile money to recharge,
people who used physical cash and other payments to recharge were less likely to use mobile
money in the GAR. This is confirmed by the negative signs of the coefficients of physical cash
and other payment methods, which are statistically significant at the 1% level, as seen in
Table 3 . This means that people who perceive services associated with mobile money as easy
to use and useful in their daily activities are inclined to use the technology relative to those
who see it as complex and useless. This is consistent with the technology acceptance theory.
In the empirical literature on use and adoption, education is considered as an essential
determinant. This is because one ’s level of education can influence his choice and adoption
decisions. That is, we expect that if respondents are educated, they would easily appreciate
new technology in the technology industry space. Informed respondents are expected to
make rational and efficient decisions as compared to the uninformed. The results show a(1) (1) (2) (2)

Logit regressionresultsIJSEpositive and statistically significant relationship between education and the adoption or use
of mobile money. Education is found to be positive and statistically highly significant. With a
marginal effect parameter estimate of approximately 0.24, it suggests that educated
respondents are 24% more likely to use mobile money as compared to the uneducated. Stated
differently, if the number of educated respondents should increase by one person, the
probability that mobile money use will rise is 24%, ceteris paribus . This result is consistent
with construct validity.
Gender differences matter in adoption decisions. So, we included gender and found it to be
negative and statistically significant. That is, with a parameter estimate of about /C00.081, it
implies that males are 8.1% less likely to use mobile money as compared to females.
Another driver of adoption that is in line with construct validity is household take-home
income. Under the consumer demand theory, a key determinant of consumer ’s adoption or
consumption behaviour is income. A priori , while lower income groups can easily be priced
out of an exchange, this is not applicable to higher income groups. Thus, the higher the
income of the consumer the more of a normal good he/she consumes, and the reverse is true.
Unexpectedly, we find income to be negative and statistically significant. This means that, if
income should rise by Ghs1, the probability that mobile money use will decrease is 3.69%,
ceteris paribus . Our results further suggest that the take-home income of respondents was a
significant driver of mobile money use in the GAR, in line with consumer demand theory.
This finding to a larger extent is plausible and not farfetched in that, mobile money services
have mainly been targeted at people in the informal sector, who fall into low and middle-
income brackets. The lower and middle-income groups are able to do business with mobile
money with ease because of the sums involved in their transactions unlike higher income
groups. The mobile money system has a cap on the amount of money that users can access
and dispense at a time. Also, financial predators with their financial burdens try to prey on
supposedly higher income groups by requesting mobile money transfers. Avoiding mobile
money use is now seen as a defensive mechanism to such financial predators.
Marital status and household size were also found to be positive, albeit insignificant. That
is, marital status and household size are not statistically significant drivers of mobile money
use in the GAR. This is because although their coefficients had positive signs, they were not
statistically significant. Suggesting that marital status and household sizes may matter in
other adoption decisions but not mobile money use.
In most developing countries, gender discrimination is still pronounced and worrying.
Toward enhancing financial inclusion, we investigated the role of mobile money use on
gender disparity. We hypothesize that, mobile money use by males is statistically different
from mobile money use by females. From Table 4 , using parametric and non-parametric tests,
we show evidence that there is a statistically significant difference between the males and the
females in mobile money use, albeit marginal. The results are robust as both parametric and
non-parametric tests provide similar results. This suggests that mobile money use has come
to bridge the hitherto huge gender disparity gap, and that, there is still room for more to be
achieved with mobile money with respect to financial inclusion and gender disparity gap.

Gender differences and
mobile money useThe use of
mobile money
in the GAR of
GhanaThis implies that mobile money use of respondents in GAR is almost similar, irrespective of
gender differences. Furthermore, the evidence adds on to the argument that innovative
technologies like mobile money contribute to universal financial access, which countries like
Ghana are working hard toward, as noted by the World Bank, “Ghana can reach universal
financial access across regions and key demographics using innovative technology ”(World
Bank, 2019 , p. 1).
5. Conclusion and recommendation
This study investigated drivers of mobile money use as a financial inclusion instrument
using primary data for 733 households resident in the GAR of Ghana. Based on the
dichotomous nature of the explained variable, a logit model with corresponding marginal
effects was employed in estimation and hypothesis testing. The study first finds that younger
respondents, i.e. technology savvy cohorts within the population, are more likely to use
mobile money. In addition, education, income and gender are key determinants of mobile
money usage of respondents living in the study area. Furthermore, parametric and non-
parametric test of mobile money use on gender revealed that there is a statistically significant
difference between male and female adoption decisions. Thus, these tests suggest improving
socio-economic characteristics of individuals could succeed in promoting financial inclusion,
financial empowerment and general wellbeing of people.
Mobile money users are generally inclined to use electronic money for transactions
compared with non-mobile money users. This is because patronage is mostly by the youth
who are technologically savvy and understand how it operates. Regarding income, mobile
money users are mostly individuals within low and middle-income brackets. Since mobile
money is a tool for financial inclusion, it is prudent to leverage its applications in extending
financial services to the poor. Through its application of technology, it has the potential to
lead an economic, social, cultural and institutional transformation through adoption and
usage among the youth. While extending financial services to the poor, mobile money can
improve efficiency and lower transaction costs. It can also bridge the gender gap in financial
access, which is biased against women.
These findings could inform policy to foster mobile money adoption in Ghana. Policy
measures to improve financial inclusion and drive technological innovation in the financial
system should focus on low and middle-income brackets who are mainly the youth. As the
study emphasizes that economic and non-economic factors such as income, education, age
and gender are important in making decisions on mobile money use, it calls for targeted and
multifaceted approach to poverty reduction by means of financial inclusion. Ghana ’s youthful
population has the ability to become more productive in the future with appropriate technical
education. This will lead to acquisition of relevant skills needed in the technological age to
raise income levels and thus enhance poverty reduction. Thus, the government must
implement policies that the youth will benefit from. In conclusion, we side with the opinion of
Carlos Vicente, World Bank Senior Financial Sector Economist, “The Government of Ghana
must lead the implementation of its financial inclusion strategy and digital finance policy; this
should be done in collaboration with the private sector. ”(World Bank, 2019 , Accra).
Notes
1. Contextual factors relate to environmental or personal characteristics that could influence
acceptance and use of technology. They could include factors such as access, motivation, ability,design, training, perceptions about compatibility, complexity, relative advantage and risk ( Charness
and Boot, 2016 ).
2. Such financial innovations were not targeted at the informal sector because of requirements such as
the depth of documentation and level of education that consumers were required to possess.IJSE3.Mugambi et al. (2014) conduct a systematic review of the business models and structure of the
M-Pesa system and highlight the benefits that have accrued to the Kenyan people by using M-Pesa.
