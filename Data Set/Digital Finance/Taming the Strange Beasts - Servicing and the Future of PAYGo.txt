Taming the Strange Beasts: Servicing and the Future of PAYGoEXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The emergence of pay-as-you-go (PAYGo) 
solar has been one of the most exciting 
trends in energy access over the past 
several years. It is a scalable model for 
distributed energy that could reach mil -
lions of off-grid households. At its core, 
PAYGo solar is an affordability solution 
that connects loan repayment to energy 
use. Over 2.5 million households have ac -
quired solar through PAYGo companies, 
but the sector needs more capital in the 
form of receivables financing to continue 
growing (Dalberg Advisors and Lighting 
Global 2018). 
What made the PAYGo sector successful 
is now holding back new firms and com -
mercial investment. The original model 
connected manufacturing, distribution, 
and financing activities to serve off-grid, 
unbanked customers (see Figure ES-1). 
This allowed firms to ensure quality ser -
vice and manage customer relationships.
As the quality of solar home sys -
tems (SHSs) improved and off-the-
shelf software platforms emerged, the new entrants left the design of hard -
ware and development to suppliers and 
turned their attention to distribution 
and financing. This new structure, called 
PAYGo 2.0 (Winiecki 2018), can be seen 
in Figure ES-2.
Similar gains can be made by decoupling 
the retail/distribution value chain from 
financing. This would allow debt inves -
tors (on or off balance sheet) to isolate 
receivables risk (i.e., customer nonpay -
ment) from the risks of the originating 
company (e.g., that they may not be 
profitable). It would also allow compa -
nies to outsource financing to financial 
institutions that have greater expertise 
in managing credit risk and larger bal -
ance sheets. We call this PAYGo 3.0, and 
an example can be seen in Figure ES-3 
(note that other versions could see the 
operator retain more control). 
Doing this means re-envisioning the 
engine of PAYGo success: servicing. In 
traditional credit sectors, loan servic -
ing means sending invoices, collecting

Taming the Strange Beasts: Servicing and the Future of PAYGopayments, reminding borrowers to pay, 
and acting when they don’t. PAYGo solar 
servicing is more complex. The con -
nection of financing and use means 
that collections are directly linked to 
device management. But the connec -
tion between use and loan repayment 
also means that any physical product 
issue—any loose wire—will lead to non -
payment and must be quickly addressed. 
These links, visualized in Figure ES-4, 
led to the creation of software platforms 
that manage financial records and track 
SHS performance—call centers that 
troubleshoot loose wires with custom -
ers and restructure their delinquent 
accounts. Because it is both high touch 
and technically complex, the quality of 
PAYGo servicing has an enormous effect 
on portfolio health.
Separating the retail and financial func -
tions of a PAYGo company will not be 
easy. It will mean accurately pricing inter -
nal transfers, deciding on a sustainable 
business model for both sides, creating 
centralized underwriting processes, split -
ting up customer service functions, and 
moving to more standardized systems and financial products. But these changes 
can bring substantial benefits. Investors 
are more likely to finance receivables 
when that’s all they are assessing. Third 
parties can potentially finance and ser -
vice PAYGo loans, but only if, at a mini -
mum, they have the option of servicing 
independently of the originating com -
pany. Even PAYGo firms that want to keep 
all elements of servicing in house would 
benefit from being able to analyze their 
respective units. And potential investors 
may value having a way to recover their 
capital, should the originator become 
insolvent. 
This is the risk that creditors are taking 
(or shrinking from) in the PAYGo sector. 
If only  an originator can service a port -
folio (largely the case) and that origina -
tor is not profitable (also often the case), 
then the value of its security (i.e., receiv -
ables) in the case of insolvency is likely 
to be severely impaired. Without a viable 
backup to the originator, any investment 
into PAYGo receivables is a bet on the 
financial health of the originator, even in 
structures specifically designed to avoid 
that risk. FIGURE  ES-3. PAYGo 3.0—Unbundling financing activities

V
Taming the Strange Beasts: Servicing and the Future of PAYGoThis is not a theoretical concern. We con -
tacted 12 leading PAYGo firms and asked 
them about their backup service arrange -
ments. Several had plans for investors or 
internal units to take over country opera -
tions and wind down a portfolio. One had 
taken over a competitor’s portfolio and 
run its systems, with some success. The 
rest had no backup plan. 
Luckily, there are several options that 
can be deployed in the short-to-medium 
term. 
■■Contingency plans where investors 
take control of the originator’s sys -
tems and rehire key staff can help to 
maintain continuity should the ser -
vicer falter or fail. 
■■Financial institutions—whether banks 
or nonbanks—can provide finance 
directly to PAYGo consumers and 
become the servicer.
■■Licensors of PAYGo software already 
have detailed knowledge of the most 
complex servicing component. They 
could explore offering backup ser -
vicing as an additional service. 
■■Competitors can arrive at bilateral 
agreements in certain markets to 
service each other’s assets under 
pre-agreed conditions. They can also 
purchase one another’s loan books 
and service active customers, if their 
systems are compatible. ■■As PAYGo solar and other asset 
finance sectors grow, there may be 
a large enough market to support a 
commercial backup servicer, which 
could operate on its own or as part 
of an investor or service company. 
Servicing is the beating heart of PAYGo’s 
strange beasts—companies that com -
bine elements of clean energy service 
companies, retailers that sell durable 
goods through diverse distribution chan -
nels, and financial institutions that pro -
vide leasing that makes valuable assets 
affordable for low-income customers.1 
As the sector grows and matures, we 
anticipate more specialization and stan -
dardization. The “beasts” are likely to 
get a little less strange, but they will be 
larger and more resilient. Reaching that 
stage may require separating SHS and 
loan service functions, without sacrific -
ing service quality or customer protec -
tion. For many companies, it will also 
require finding a backup to give inves -
tors the security they need. 
PAYGo solar is not an average oppor -
tunity. Distributed solar is becoming a 
viable energy option. Customers that 
have never seen the inside of a bank are 
being approved for loans they desper -
ately need. But this sector is too young 
and too strange to unnecessarily risk 
financial disruptions. Customers need 
this to work, and for it to work, there 
must be safeguards.

Taming the Strange Beasts: Servicing and the Future of PAYGoINTRODUCTION
The emergence of pay-as-you-go (PAYGo) 
solar as a viable channel for scaling dis -
tributed energy has been one of the most 
exciting trends in energy access over the 
past several years. For the first time, we 
have a potentially scalable model that 
could bring distributed, modern energy to 
millions of people. 
At its core, PAYGo financing for solar 
is not just an energy solution, it is an 
affordability solution. The upfront cost 
of distributed solar had been too high 
for decades. PAYGo solar companies 
borrowed a trick from mobile phone 
companies and electric utilities: they 
embedded lockout technology in solar 
home systems (SHSs) that allowed them 
to offer prepaid service to customers 
using mobile money. They connected 
usage payments to financing and 
extended that financing to unbanked, 
off-grid customers—both breakthroughs 
that have major potential for the financing 
of other assets. Over 3 million SHSs have 
been sold on PAYGo contracts in the past 
five years, thus unlocking modern energy 
and formal financing for people who had 
never had access to either.
But much more needs to be done for the 
sector to deliver basic energy access to 
the hundreds of millions of people who 
will remain off-grid for the foreseeable 
future. To truly scale up the PAYGo oppor -
tunity, the sector needs the following:
■■More companies operating in more 
markets. In a universal access sce -
nario for Africa, the Shell Foundation 
and Catalyst Off-Grid Advisors esti -
mate that nearly 300 new operating 
companies will need to reach scale 
across the continent.
■■Sustainable companies that demon -
strate an ability to produce profits 
without regular injections of equity 
or grants.■■Much more capital, especially debt. 
In its 2018 Off-Grid Solar Trends 
Report, Dalberg estimated that 
PAYGo providers will require about 
$3.5 billion in receivables financing 
between 2017 and 2022. Cumulative 
investment in the sector to date is 
still less than $1 billion.
Reaching those hundreds of millions will 
require more innovation. The title of this 
paper references “Strange Beasts: Mak -
ing Sense of PAYGo Business Models,” 
which shows how the original PAYGo 
model is a strange beast comprising an 
unusual combination of manufacturing, 
distribution, and financing activities 
(Sotiriou, Bardouille, Waldron, and Van -
zulli 2018). This vertically and horizon -
tally integrated structure was designed 
out of necessity, one that arguably no 
longer exists. We are already long past 
the point where PAYGo providers need 
to develop their own hardware or prod -
uct management software. Specialized 
partners can do this faster, better, and 
cheaper. And as the PAYGo solar sector 
continues to mature, greater specializa -
tion can enable broader participation 
from a wider range of actors. 
This separation and outsourcing, the illu -
sive “taming” of these strange beasts, is 
not easy. For some companies, it may not 
even be desirable. A series of existential 
decisions face PAYGo firms, new and old: 
■■What kind of company do we want 
to be? Where can we add the most 
value? 
■■What kind of financing will sus -
tainably fuel our growth, instead of 
impede it? 
■■How can we structure our company 
to attract that kind of financing? 
Companies that want all their opera -
tions under one roof will want to know 
which operations are performing well 
at a given time. Companies that want to 2
Taming the Strange Beasts: Servicing and the Future of PAYGooutsource financing or loan servicing 
will need to extricate those activities. 
And investors in the receivables of either 
type of company will want to know that 
outstanding balances can still be col -
lected should something happen to the 
originator. This is no trivial risk. 
Despite its tremendous promise, the 
PAYGo industry is still young and chal -
lenging. Entrepreneurs and investors 
should expect and prepare for some 
failures. To plan for the future and pre -
pare for unpleasant contingencies, there 
needs to be more focus on loan servicing 
in the PAYGo sector. It is the link between 
energy and finance, an area where 
uncoupling can unlock future growth—and a major risk for investors. If capital 
recovery depends on the originating 
company—which is the only entity that 
can service its units and loans—then 
receivables investors risk substantial 
losses should that firm become negligent 
or insolvent.
This paper explores the strategic impor -
tance of PAYGo servicing in detail. The 
next sections introduce the PAYGo solar 
model and revisit its value chains struc -
ture to highlight the strategic importance 
of servicing; look at the various receiv -
ables financing options for PAYGo firms; 
explore the risk of complete reliance on 
PAYGo originators for servicing; and con -
clude with recommendations.3
Taming the Strange Beasts: Servicing and the Future of PAYGoTHE VALUE CHAINS WITHIN PAYG o SOLAR
PAYGo solar is the common term for roof -
top SHSs that are sold and/or distributed 
on a financed basis, which lowers the 
upfront cost of a small-to-medium size 
SHS from $60–200 to $10–50. If custom -
ers can afford the upfront deposit and 
meet some basic criteria, the PAYGo com -
pany will lease them a system, usually on a 
lease-to-own basis. Once customers have 
an SHS, they prepay for days of energy 
use. When they run out of days, the system 
shuts off and cannot be used again until 
another payment is received. 
In a lease-to-own model, this continues 
until the customer has purchased the con -
tracted amount of days (anywhere from 6 
to 60 months of energy). At that point the 
SHS unlocks permanently, although the 
provider may offer an option to relock 
the SHS to finance another device, such 
as a phone or cookstove.
PAYGo is a capital-intensive business. 
Companies extend asset-based loans to 
low-to-medium income households for 
up to three years (more, in some cases). 
Although these loans may be highly 
profitable on a per-unit basis, the capi -
tal is not recovered for months or years. 
Like any lender, these companies will 
struggle to scale rapidly without capital 
to finance their growing receivables. 
This paper focuses on the PAYGo solar 
sector; however, entrepreneurs in Africa and Asia are already applying the same 
financing model to other types of assets. 
Companies around the world are running 
into the same challenge: there are no well-
developed ecosystems for small-scale 
consumer asset financing or equipment 
leasing in the places where people need 
those assets the most. This paper aims 
to be useful to entrepreneurs who are 
exploring ways of financing access to 
their products.
The most successful “first generation” 
PAYGo companies—which still account 
for about 90 percent of the sales in the 
sector—create their own PAYGo hard -
ware, develop software to manage it, 
build their own distribution networks, 
and finance their sales on their own bal -
ance sheets. The PAYGo firm is both dis -
tributor and underwriter, retailer and 
bank. Each of these two main businesses 
(three, if you include manufacturing), in 
turn, conducts many specialized activi -
ties (see Figure 1). 
Recently, the product/retail side of PAYGo 
solar has become noticeably “decoupled” 
as firms have outsourced activities to spe -
cialists. Two important trends have driven 
this shift:
1. Hardware . Solar manufacturers have 
begun licensing PAYGo-ready SHS. 
Local firms can order kits from qual -
ity manufacturers, white-label them 
FIGURE  1. PAYGo value chain framework 
Reference: Sotiriou, Bardouille, Waldron, and Vanzulli (2018)4
Taming the Strange Beasts: Servicing and the Future of PAYGowith a local brand or co-brand with 
the manufacturer, and focus on dis -
tributing and financing.
2. Management platforms . Concur -
rently, companies have begun to 
license PAYGo management software, 
which are closely linked to the hard -
ware. These software platforms han -
dle sales, registrations, billing, mobile 
money payments, system (un)locking, 
remote device monitoring, and more. 
They help distributors manage a large 
portfolio of distributed assets from 
several manufacturers. 
New firms now face a shorter path to 
market and can offer customers a wider 
range of off-the-shelf products at a 
variety of price points, all managed by 
off-the-shelf software. This is “PAYGo 
2.0,” where unbundling of the value 
chain reduces upfront costs and adds 
flexibility, which allows new operating 
companies to be created and to enter 
the market faster (Winiecki 2018). The 
value chain framework for a PAYGo 2.0 
provider can be seen in Figure 2. Whither PAYGo 3.0?
Although it may have gotten signifi -
cantly easier to get a product to market, 
there has been no equivalent change in 
the financing operations of the leading 
PAYGo companies. Providers have kept 
origination, underwriting, and servicing 
in house, and most PAYGo loans still sit 
on the balance sheet of their originators. 
PAYGo companies, new and old, could 
benefit from decoupling the retail/distri -
bution value chain from financing. This 
would allow debt investors (on or off-bal -
ance sheet) to isolate receivables risk (i.e., 
customer nonpayment) from the risks 
of the originating company (e.g., that 
they may not be profitable). It could also 
allow companies to outsource financing 
to financial institutions that have credit 
expertise and balance sheets. Looking 
at an example in Figure 3, one can see a 
PAYGo provider that manages distribu -
tion and owns the customer relationship, 
while being able to scale far more rapidly. 
Other versions of PAYGo 3.0 could see the 
operator retain more control. FIGURE  2. PAYGo 2.0—Unbundling manufacturing/development
FIGURE  3. PAYGo 3.0—Unbundling financing activities5
Taming the Strange Beasts: Servicing and the Future of PAYGoBut many factors have kept PAYGo solar 
providers from decoupling their financ -
ing operations in this way, including:
■■Unwilling partners.  With few excep -
tions, local banks and microfinance 
institutions have not been enthusi -
astic about financing PAYGo solar 
end borrowers. They often are not 
familiar with the sector or they lack 
the deep network penetration to effi -
ciently reach PAYGo customers. They 
are also wary of relying on PAYGo pro -
viders for underwriting and servic -
ing, and PAYGo customer relationship 
management (CRM) systems may not 
meet the regulated standards for core 
banking systems. 
■■Resource constraints . Internal 
restructuring to create legally distinct, 
financial institution-like subsidiaries 
is difficult and time-consuming. Given 
the many operational and finan -
cial challenges these firms face, such 
an effort may not be a top prior -
ity. Although some companies have 
started to go down this path, we may 
not see evidence of change for some 
time.
■■Customer ownership . Companies 
universally believe (and are likely to 
be correct) that there is significant 
value in their long-term relation -
ships with clients. After establishing 
a payment history, digital payment 
capability, and remotely securable 
collateral, they can continue to serve 
their customers at significantly higher 
margins—financing more assets like 
larger systems or cookstoves or offer -
ing nonasset financing for essential 
needs such as school fees. 
■■Moral hazard . Financial value chain 
decoupling may reveal misaligned 
interests. In an integrated business, 
there are incentives to sell as many 
systems as possible, but the com -
pany is also fully accountable for any decline in repayment rates. This is 
not to say that a short-term impetus 
to sell cannot overwhelm portfolio 
quality (arguably what happened in 
the early years of PAYGo). But credit 
losses should drive companies to bal -
ance growth with quality. Belief on the 
origination side of the business that a 
third party bears all receivable risk—
that it is no longer responsible for 
onboarding good customers that will 
repay—can be a recipe for disaster.
■■Loan and asset servicing linkages . 
When a customer’s lights stop work -
ing, they will stop paying. Conversely, 
when a customer stops paying, their 
lights must stop working. This connec -
tion of use to financing demands tight 
coordination across the value chains. 
Many of these barriers will fall with 
time. Partners will emerge as compa -
nies develop longer track records and 
more standardized business models. 
Resource constraints can be overcome, 
and companies can partner without 
losing the customer relationship or 
misaligning incentives. But servicing 
is the key to enabling PAYGo 3.0, which 
involves unlocking sustainable receiv -
ables financing and allowing new busi -
ness models to enter the PAYGo sector. 
Servicing 
“Servicing” can be defined as: 
“ All the various activities that the 
originator would have, in normal 
course of business, performed in 
relation to the obligors—sending 
invoices, monitoring collections, 
sending reminders, taking recovery 
action, and so on—and all the activi -
ties in relation to distribution of the 
cash so collected to investors are 
covered by the catchall word servic -
ing” Fabozzi and Kothari (2008).
Although this definition is slightly apro -
pos to asset-backed securities in the 6
Taming the Strange Beasts: Servicing and the Future of PAYGoUnited States, the core role of servic -
ing is well defined: a servicer acts as an 
intermediary between obligors (i.e., end 
borrowers) and investors. 
In the PAYGo solar sector, loan servicing 
narrowly means collecting payments, 
unlocking devices, restructuring delin -
quent accounts, repeatedly reaching out 
to delinquent customers, and repossess -
ing units in default. However, because 
use is linked directly to payment, PAYGo 
servicing effectively includes other 
activities, such as product repairs, trou -
bleshooting mobile money issues, cus -
tomer service, call center management, 
and unit monitoring. And as the sale of 
a PAYGo asset is also the origination of 
a PAYGo loan, sales and underwriting 
remain both tightly linked and constantly 
in tension. If Figure 3 represents a possi -
ble future, then Figure 4 is the present.
Servicing is the linchpin of PAYGo 
solar’s success
Although this claim may sound dra -
matic, we absolutely believe it to be true:
■■PAYGo solar is a combination of two 
businesses, with the customer-facing 
service function acting as the bridge 
between them. A PAYGo operator 
promises its customers that it will 
service their SHS, and it promises its 
investors that it will service the loans 
it has originated. These may sound 
like separate actions—in most credit 
sectors they are separate—but in 
this case, they are strongly linked. 
 The financing-to-use connection 
ties collections to device manage -ment. But the connection of use to 
loan repayment also means that any 
physical product issue—any loose 
wire—will lead to nonpayment and 
must be quickly addressed. Therefore, 
software platforms manage financial 
records and track SHS performance 
and call centers troubleshoot loose 
wires and restructure delinquent 
accounts. 
■■PAYGo servicing is technologically 
complex. The CRM platform at the 
core of PAYGo servicing monitors 
units, reconciles and processes 
mobile payments, and then trans -
mits unlock codes to the customer’s 
phone or other device. This requires 
several interactions with mobile 
network operators (MNOs) and 
aggregators of payment or SMS ser -
vices. Any operational issues with 
the CRM platform directly affects 
loan repayment.
■■PAYGo servicing is high touch. PAYGo 
customers’ revenues fluctuate and 
so do their payment patterns. Cur -
rently, most PAYGo “underwriting” 
involves ensuring the customer can 
pay an up-front deposit. As a result, 
even the best companies have rela -
tively high delinquency rates. To be 
successful, PAYGo companies need 
efficient call centers to contact cus -
tomers who are delinquent and to 
work with the customers to restruc -
ture their payment plans. In many 
cases, staff will need to visit delin -
quent customers to collect payments 
or repossess systems. This type of 
servicing has much in common with 
FIGURE  4. Servicing linkages between PAYGo value chains7
Taming the Strange Beasts: Servicing and the Future of PAYGomicrofinance, where “loans are cre -
ated, nurtured, and serviced by the 
field officer who maintains a regular 
franchise with the borrower” (Rozas 
and Kothari 2010). However, high-
touch models make any servicer 
migration difficult, and there are few 
if any examples of a successful ser -
vicer migration in microfinance.
■■The difference between a high- quality 
PAYGo servicer and a poor one is of 
massive financial consequence. It is 
generally true in most credit sectors that the quality of a servicer deter -
mines the value of the receivables 
they are servicing. The same is true of 
PAYGo, except more so, because of the 
sheer number of functions that affect 
customer repayment. 
There is no PAYGo solar without effec -
tive servicing. And for most companies, 
servicing continues to link the two value 
chains. This has enabled PAYGo firms to 
ensure quality and grow to where they 
are today. But it may act as a barrier to 
new forms of financing.8
Taming the Strange Beasts: Servicing and the Future of PAYGoOPTIONS FOR FINANCING PAYGO SOLAR
Four distinct models—on-balance, off-  
balance/capitalization, captive finance, 
and direct financial inclusion financ -
ing—have been used in similar indus -
tries to fund receivables. In this section 
we examine their applicability to the 
PAYGo sector. These models can be 
viewed on a continuum based on the 
extent to which the financing value chain 
is separated from the originating com -
pany, with on-balance sheet at one end 
and outsourcing financing to banks at 
the other end (see Figure 5).
There are trade-offs along this contin -
uum, and choosing a receivables financ -
ing strategy requires knowing where a 
company adds value and playing to those 
strengths. PAYGo receivables financing 
models need to be scalable in local cur -
rency. The models presented here are 
not mutually exclusive, and we would 
expect PAYGo solar to emulate microfi -
nance’s strategy of financing receivables 
with a mix of on-balance sheet debt and 
securitizations, with deposits possibly 
playing a role. 
When assessing the applicability of 
these models to the PAYGo sector, we 
consider three questions:
■■Will the financing structure create 
misalignment of incentives? ■■What are the strategic implications 
for companies’ business models?
■■What are the servicing requirements 
of each financing model?
On-balance sheet financing 
On-balance sheet borrowing facilities, in 
various forms, are the most basic form 
of debt capital. They are commonly 
structured as fixed-term or revolving 
loans of varying maturities. These facili -
ties typically focus on cash flow aspects 
of the business as a whole as the key 
credit criteria: how much cash does the 
business generate relative to its ongo -
ing loan repayments? This model is best 
suited for companies with a track record 
of cashflow and profitability that lend -
ers can assess and lend against. 
Asset-based lending (ABL)—a form of 
on-balance sheet lending—is increas -
ingly being used in the PAYGo sector. In 
ABL, the lender does not rely on corpo -
rate cash flows to secure loan repayment. 
Instead, it lends against the physical and 
financial assets of the company such as 
inventory and receivables. The company 
retains ownership of the receivables and 
uses them as collateral to raise finance 
on balance sheet. The key lender crite -
rion is an assessment of the value of the

against which they lend. Given that the 
assets of PAYGo companies are mostly 
its customer receivables, this financing 
model could be highly relevant. 
In on-balance sheet models, the PAYGo 
company is fully integrated with the 
originator and servicer under the same 
roof. Incentives should be fully aligned. 
Lenders under this structure are explic -
itly taking both operating company and 
receivables risk.
Off-balance sheet structures
In an off-balance sheet receivables struc -
ture, companies sell receivables to a sep -
arate entity—typically a special-purpose 
vehicle (SPV) or a factoring company—to 
separate the risk of the receivables from 
that of the originator/operating com -
pany.2 The core objective of this structure 
is to allow lenders to assess the receiv -
ables risk in isolation (i.e., there is no 
ongoing risk exposure to the originator), 
which enables companies to standardize 
their fundraising process to potentially 
attract different types of investors and 
achieve better terms. In factoring, the 
purchaser typically assumes the primary 
servicing role whereas, in SPV struc -
tures, the originator typically retains this 
function. Investors that buy receivables 
off balance sheet will focus on portfolio 
quality and the expected cash flow gen -
erated by the pooled receivables. Compa -
nies normally will also raise on-balance 
sheet corporate loans to fund different 
capital requirements. 
Off-balance sheet: Securitization
Securitization is a type of off-balance 
sheet structure in which the SPV raises 
debt by issuing receivables-backed 
securities or bonds. This has become a common way for companies to finance 
receivables in developed markets, with 
standardized structures for sectors such 
as mortgages and credit cards. Other 
sectors are starting to securitize as well. 
In developed markets, securitization 
functions within a robust ecosystem that 
includes third-party consumer credit 
scores, ratings agencies, and specialized 
backup servicers. Large volumes allow 
borrowers to amortize the high struc -
turing and service costs across a large 
ticket size.
SPV and securitization can create the 
greatest risk of moral hazard. In devel -
oped markets, consumer credit scores 
are important as a check on receivables 
quality at the time of purchase, while 
backup servicers mitigate the risk of a 
primary servicer (an originator) going 
under. Credit card and mortgage servic -
ing is highly standardized and thus can 
be easily replicated by one of several 
backup servicers, who can take the place 
of the originator with little to no impact 
on the value of the receivables. 
Captive finance companies 
Captive finance companies (FinCos) are 
wholly owned subsidiaries of manufac -
turing and distribution groups. Their only 
function is to finance customers’ pur -
chases of the group’s products, effectively 
acting as an in-house bank. The FinCo and 
the manufacturing and distribution group 
are operationally and financially distinct 
(i.e., each has its own balance sheet) and 
can be funded and analyzed separately. 
The FinCo can generate a significant pro -
portion of the group’s overall revenues.3
The use of captive FinCos is most com -
monly associated with vertically inte -
grated manufacturing companies (e.g., 
cars and agricultural equipment). Up 
2 For a more detailed discussion of securitization in general and as applied to distributed energy, see Aidun and Muench (2016).
3 Captives of U.S. auto companies contribute, on average, one-third of the group’s total profits (Deloitte n.d.).10
Taming the Strange Beasts: Servicing and the Future of PAYGoto 30 percent of all equipment pur -
chases (including cars) in the United 
States are now financed through captive 
FinCos, the largest of which include John 
Deere, Volvo, and Caterpillar (Frechette, 
Gerard, and Wiener n.d.). From a com -
pany perspective, this model means the 
servicing obligation stays within the 
group, and the customer relationship 
is also retained, which may be valuable 
for future sales opportunities. Since the 
product company and FinCo ultimately 
have the same ownership, some of the 
risks of misalignment that can exist with 
off-balance sheet receivables financ -
ing structures may be mitigated. Both 
subsidiaries are incentivized to gen -
erate sales volume, but also to ensure 
the quality of the loans. The FinCo, like 
any financial institution, may choose to 
finance its receivables with on-balance 
or off-balance sheet debt.
Outsourcing to banks and other 
financial institutions 
Most consumer finance in developed 
markets is provided by banks or non -
bank specialty finance companies. Once 
again, auto loans are a good example. As 
described earlier, in the United States, 
auto loans can be provided by captive 
finance companies, but banks and spe -
cialty auto finance companies that focus 
on consumers with poor credit ratings 
also provide financing. These lenders 
develop programs with dealerships that 
identify potential customers with the 
right credit profile and then sell cars to 
them. Customers make a down payment 
and finance the balance with a loan from 
the specialty lender, who purchases port -
folios of these loans in bulk. In addition to 
credit ratings, these lenders can use their 
own data analytics to further refine their 
underwriting process. 
From the dealership’s perspective, this 
is a purely cash sale, and it does not get 
involved in the financing value chain. 
Importantly, when the specialty auto lender takes on the consumer loan, it also 
takes on the loan servicing (monitoring, 
collections, repossession), which is a core 
business for it and the key to long term 
sustainability and profitability.
Trends in PAYGo financing
Most of the debt in the PAYGo SHS sector 
has been raised on-balance sheet. Lend -
ing structures range from corporate-type 
term loan facilities, ABL structures, and 
hybrids. In all cases, funds are primarily 
used to grow the receivables book, and 
the primary asset security available to 
lenders are these receivables. 
At the same time, alternatives have 
emerged over the past few years. Sev -
eral companies raised debt off-balance 
sheet in 2017 and 2018. In the long term 
this could allow them to develop scalable 
capital-raising programs and attract com -
mercial investors, although it is unclear 
whether commercial investors, partic -
ularly local ones that could lend in local 
currency, have the appetite for this type 
of asset. An important caveat to existing 
structures in the PAYGo sector is that 
most lenders still have recourse in various 
forms to the originator, in the case where 
repayment rates sink below certain tar -
gets. In a true off-balance sheet transac -
tion, that recourse would not exist.
Several PAYGo companies are also exper -
imenting with outsourcing the financing 
value chain so that they can reduce oper -
ational complexity and focus on prod -
uct development, manufacturing, and/
or distribution. Financial institutions are 
understandably reluctant to fund receiv -
ables on a nonrecourse basis without hav -
ing an active role in underwriting and/or 
servicing. In lieu of those, PAYGo opera -
tors have provided significant financial 
guarantees, thus limiting the immediate 
financial benefits of the partnership. As 
we’ve already highlighted, PAYGo com -
panies are often reluctant to give up their 
long-term relationship with the customer.11
Taming the Strange Beasts: Servicing and the Future of PAYGoTable 1 compares the various financ -
ing options across a range of variables. 
As the table makes clear, servicing the 
receivables portfolio is of utmost impor -
tance, no matter which finance option 
is used. Unfortunately, the servicing 
arrangement of most PAYGo models lim -
its their ability to create a captive FinCo, 
isolate receivables risk, or outsource 
financing to a third party. 
Isolating loan servicing from the man -
agement of physical products could 
yield sizeable returns. Investors are 
more likely to finance receivables when 
that is all they are assessing. Third par -
ties can potentially finance and service 
PAYGo loans, but only if, at a mini -
mum, they have the option of servicing independently of the originating com -
pany. Even PAYGo firms that want to 
keep all elements of servicing in-house 
would benefit from the ability to ana -
lyze the respective units separately. 
Separating the retail company from 
the financing entity will take time and 
experimentation. 
What would it take to get to 
PAYGo 3.0?
Some or all of the following steps may 
be needed to encourage more financial 
institutions and investors to participate 
in the sector:

Taming the Strange Beasts: Servicing and the Future of PAYGofor which parts does not matter as 
much as it does for separate enti -
ties. When financial statements are 
separated for the distribution and 
financing entities, accurate transfer 
pricing will be a precondition for 
any accurate analysis. 
■■Decoupling customer service.  It 
still may be helpful for customers to 
have a single point of contact with the 
PAYGo provider. But once customers’ 
issues are assessed and triaged by 
the PAYGo provider, separate service 
units may need to step in. Several 
companies already have established 
this approach for repayment issues, 
which allows for closer monitoring 
and potential transfer of the repay -
ment function to an external party. 
■■Centralized and automated under -
writing. Although not directly related 
to servicing, having a centralized, 
auditable process would give finance 
partners a better understanding of 
the customers they are financing. 
It can also give the credit operation 
more control over the growth of 
sales. If early portfolio quality is suf -
fering, then underwriting criteria can 
be raised on some or all customers. 
Credit scoring for established PAYGo 
customers is an important first step.
■■Discrete, small-scale pilots . Noth -
ing will replace the level of comfort 
that develops over time as two orga -
nizations work together. To expose 
new partners to their operations, 
PAYGo firms may want to share data 
on discrete pilots, or de-risk the par -
ticipation of potential partners.
■■Standardize operating systems. 
As a rule, traditional financial insti -
tutions struggle with custom soft -
ware integrations. Robust servicing 
ecosystems exist in other credit 
sectors because financial products 
and systems are harmonized across 
businesses. These steps will not only make it easier to 
attract financing and facilitate specializa -
tion, they will also make it far easier for 
investors to guard against possible shocks. 
Growth in receivables financing will 
require PAYGo providers to have 
another entity that is able to service 
their outstanding loans
Although servicing has been the linch -
pin of PAYGo’s success, further growth 
will depend on more standardization 
and greater security. 
■■To uncouple the financial value 
chain, which would enable inves -
tors to more easily assess receiv -
ables risk and providers to focus on 
activities where they have a compet -
itive advantage, the distributing and 
financing entities need to be sepa -
rated. Investors and partners need 
transparency on how the financing 
operation is run, particularly if they 
are going to run it themselves. 
■■Any investor that is taking receiv -
ables as collateral will need a strat -
egy to recover that capital without 
relying solely on the originator. If 
the originator becomes insolvent or 
delinquent in its duties, investors 
will require some type of backup 
servicer. Otherwise, the risk of cus -
tomer repayment will not be effec -
tively isolated from the risk of the 
originator, and all debt is effectively 
at the group level. Even in the case of 
a PAYGo operator that sees servicing 
as a core business  and is borrowing 
on-balance sheet, a credible backup 
servicing option would greatly 
improve the overall risk profile and 
lead to better borrowing terms.
The latter is a significant and under -
appreciated risk in the PAYGo sector. No 
matter how receivables are financed, it 
warrants both contemplation and miti -
gation.13
Taming the Strange Beasts: Servicing and the Future of PAYGoSTATE OF BACKUP SERVICING IN THE PAYGO SECTOR AND 
THE IMPLICATIONS FOR DEBT FINANCING
Transferring risk
In off-balance sheet financing and other 
transactions, assets must be moved off 
the books of the originator. That move -
ment takes place in a “true sale,” which is 
the legal term for a “sale of a receivable by 
the owner to another person, such that 
the receivable is protected from claims 
against the seller’s assets in the event 
of the seller’s insolvency” (Simmons & 
Simmons 2016). This transfer creates an 
important protection for debt investors.
From a customer perspective, nothing 
changes after a true sale has been made. 
Customers pay for solar, and the system 
turns on. Those payments go to the new 
owner of the debt, but that shouldn’t 
matter to customers; they don’t even 
need to change the number they send 
payments to or the account number they 
use. That’s because the payments don’t 
flow directly to the investor. Payments 
are still processed by the servicer, but 
they are automatically separated from 
the servicer’s revenue, and then collected 
and passed on to the investor. Legally, 
those loans do not belong to the origi -
nator anymore. Originators just handle 
the money. Making a “true sale” means that receivables become ring-fenced and 
bankruptcy- remote from their origina -
tor—the risk of customer nonpayment is 
now legally and financially distinct from 
all the risks of the originating enterprise.
But that is true only if another entity 
can service those loans. Otherwise, it is 
merely an “illusion”:
“Securitization transactions are pre -
sumably independent of the origi -
nator due to the legal isolation the 
transaction achieves due to ‘true 
sale.’ However, the truth of the sale 
might turn out to be a glib illusion 
if the servicing platform is so inti -
mately originator-dependent that it 
is difficult to perceive its transfer” 
(Fabozzi and Kothari 2008)
Unfortunately, servicing platforms that 
are “intimately originator-dependent” 
are exactly what we see in the PAYGo 
sector. Collecting payments is just one of 
many customer-facing functions that a 
PAYGo company carries out, and it is not 
easy to disentangle from the others. Fig -
ure 6 illustrates the customer’s perspec -
tive; they rely on a single point of contact 
for every interaction, which makes out -
sourcing just one of those problematic. 
FIGURE  6. The PAYGo provider-customer relationship14
Taming the Strange Beasts: Servicing and the Future of PAYGoCurrent backup servicing 
arrangements in PAYGo
We contacted 12 leading PAYGo compa -
nies and investors to ask them whether 
there was anyone else who could take over 
servicing outstanding loans/customers 
on short notice in case of a bankruptcy:
■■One company did not have a backup 
servicer in place but did have expe -
rience taking over the servicing of a 
competitor’s portfolio (see Box 1).
■■Three had “living wills” or rundown 
plans wherein the holders of senior 
originator or SPV debt have a pre-  
existing plan to take over and use the 
originator’s systems until the port -
folio was paid down (see Box 2). A 
“skeleton crew” of key staff would be 
retained at significantly higher sala -
ries, given the lack of future opportu -
nities at the defunct PAYGo company. 
They would keep the PAYGo provid -
er’s core CRM systems and call center 
running to provide a minimal level of 
customer service and loan servicing. 
■■Two of these companies had 
raised debt on their balance sheets, while the other had cre -
ated an off-balance sheet facility.
■■A company that had several local 
subsidiaries planned to use a group-
level expansion team that could func -
tion as a floating, backup servicer in 
the event of a national subsidiary 
becoming insolvent. The team could 
be onsite and integrated relatively 
quickly. An important assumption in 
this scenario is that the bankruptcy 
of the national subsidiary does not 
bring down the group. 
■■This company had raised debt 
both on- and off-balance sheet
■■The rest had no concrete plan in 
place for backup servicing: 
■■Roughly half had considered the 
problem and developed theoret -
ical solutions but had not been 
incentivized by investors to put 
them into place.
■■The other half were considering 
the problem for the first time 
during our conversations.BOX 1. Case Study of EcoEnergy
The PAYGo sector in Pakistan may be nascent, but with more than 65 million people 
living off-grid, it’s growing rapidly and proving to be an exciting area for experimen -
tation. When the Norwegian firm Brighterlite ran into financial difficulties, it looked 
for ways to guarantee service to its clients.
Not wanting customers or the sector’s reputation to suffer, and seeing an opportunity 
to grow its customer base overnight, EcoEnergy, which sells and services high-
quality solar solutions, purchased Brighterlite Pakistan’s portfolio of 3,000 customers 
for $100,000. This included 1,100 active customers, who EcoEnergy needed to 
service using Brighterlite’s own, noncompatible systems. Despite the systems issues, 
two-thirds of clients with working systems remain active with EcoEnergy, and the 
company plans to cross-sell products to the entire customer base.

Taming the Strange Beasts: Servicing and the Future of PAYGoBOX 2. Rundown scenario
What are the objectives?  The objectives are to maximize the value of a PAYGo 
receivables portfolio in the case of insolvency of the PAYGo company. In this situ -
ation, lenders will seek to extract as much value as possible from the physical and 
financial assets securing their loan, which for PAYGo companies are predominantly 
inventory and receivables. Lenders may develop a “rundown scenario” to better 
understand the capacity of the receivables base to pay down the loan balance, 
thus allowing for better credit risk analysis of a potential transaction. 
When would a rundown happen?  This would happen when the company is un -
able to service its debt because of a worsened financial situation and equity inves -
tors are unwilling or unable to contribute additional capital to service the loan. At 
this point, restructuring is no longer an option. 
What does it mean? When a rundown is activated, the company stops originating 
new loans or spending time and money on noncore activities, such as market -
ing, research and development, etc. Operating expenses and staff are drastically 
downsized to the strict minimum needed to liquidate remaining inventory through 
cash sales to customers or other companies and to maximize cash collection from 
current customers. 
Lenders can project the estimated cashflows that can be collected from custom -
ers (accounting for a potential increase in delinquency rates once the company’s 
bankruptcy becomes public knowledge and/or servicing quality deteriorates) and 
the time needed to pay down the outstanding debt with these cashflows. A dis -
counted offer for immediate purchase creates an initial influx of cash, while the rest 
trickles in over time. Overall recovery is about 90 percent.
Lenders can be given the right to initiate the rundown scenario within loan docu -
mentation.
What are the limitations? Assumptions on how delinquency rates will increase 
within a portfolio postcompany insolvency and on the company’s ability to liqui -
date inventories at a reasonable price are difficult to make ex-ante and have not 
been tested in practice. It also may be difficult to properly incentivize company 
staff and management to stay on to manage the portfolio through a rundown, 
although this could be mitigated by increasing short-term salaries.The existing options of investor-led 
rundown or group-level takeover are 
good first steps. If there is no backup 
servicer, the solution may be to recycle 
the pieces of the originator that would 
be needed by investors or other busi -
ness units to manage a rundown. But 
this solution still depends on backup 
systems being established in case of 
technical issues and employees having 
sufficient goodwill and/or short-term 
remuneration to stay onboard a sinking ship. These solutions are significantly 
better than nothing, but are not suf -
ficient to attract cheaper, commercial 
capital at scale. 
Can we have a “true” transfer of 
risk in PAYGo?
Whether financed on-balance, off-  
balance, or by a third party, the risk 
of customer nonpayment on PAYGo 
receivables is tied tightly to the risk of 16
Taming the Strange Beasts: Servicing and the Future of PAYGothe originator. If the originator becomes 
insolvent and a backup does not come 
online quickly, the value of those 
receivables will be severely diminished, 
if not wiped out. Given that no PAYGo 
originators are currently profitable and 
relatively few originators have a plan 
in place for backup servicing, this is 
clearly a problem. 
Muench and Aidun (2016) surfaced this 
issue when describing the benefits and 
risks of securitization for the off-grid 
sector: 
“For all practical purposes the origi -
nating DESCO is the only entity that 
can effectively serve as servicer to 
collect the SPV’s customer contracts 
and service the customers’ systems.” 
To be clear, Muench and Aidun argue 
that a backup servicing industry should 
emerge over time, but we are not there 
yet. The bottom line is that PAYGo 
receivables are not bankruptcy-remote 
just because a legal contract says they 
are or because they cannot be claimed 
by the originator’s creditors. They are 
bankruptcy-remote only if they still have 
value after an originator bankruptcy . In 
many cases, that value would be severely 
impaired—hence the “glib illusion” that 
Fabozzi and Kothari allude to. 
Some investors argue that rundown sce -
narios like the one described in Box 2 are 
viable mitigants. Others believe that the 
servicer risk has been adequately priced 
in, and/or that there are sufficient eq -
uity buffers acting as security. Although 
some may disagree on these points, 
all agree that a viable backup servicer 
would provide higher levels of security 
for the lender and would ultimately lead 
to a more resilient sector. 
Options to outsource and backup 
servicing in PAYGo
Decoupling the financial value chain and 
mitigating servicing risk are both criti -cal to reach the scale PAYGo solar can 
achieve by making companies more sus -
tainable, efficient, and resilient. Inves -
tors and companies need to prioritize 
viable servicing options. These options 
can vary greatly in the scope of services 
provided, which may affect repayment 
(see Box 3).
The ability to outsource debt collection 
to third parties is necessary to unlock 
investment. It is also a risk. Because the 
incentives to treat customers fairly and 
with respect may not be as well-aligned 
with third parties, industry stakehold -
ers need to supervise the conduct and 
operations of the third parties. Custom -
ers deserve transparency and fair treat -
ment from any servicer. 
Licensor-licensee arrangements
The uncoupling of the product value 
chain that was described earlier has 
been made possible by providers licens -
ing PAYGo-ready hardware and software 
management tools to numerous local dis -
tributors. These providers are well-po -
sitioned to offer a stand-alone servicing 
product that could operate in backup or 
primary mode. The offering might be an 
extension of CRM licenses and could in -
clude call center functionality and credit/
data analytics (Tiers 1-2 in Box 3).
A model more suited for backup ser -
vicing could be used by licensors that 
are running their own PAYGo opera -
tions. This would allow them to step 
in and provide servicing under certain 
circumstances. Licensors’ combination 
of hardware, software, and operational 
expertise makes them ideal backup ser -
vicers to their licensees, and they could 
potentially maintain a high-level of cus -
tomer service (Tiers 1-4) until a new 
licensee is found. To a lesser degree, this 
may also work with licensees acting as 
backups to the licensor. Conversations 
with both licensors and licensees indi -
cate that there is support for this idea. 17
Taming the Strange Beasts: Servicing and the Future of PAYGoPartnerships with established 
financial institutions
Existing financial institutions (whether 
banks, microfinance institutions, or 
other specialists) can and should play a 
bigger role in servicing financial assets. 
They have the expertise, systems, and 
capital that could bring large bene -
fits (Waldron 2018). At the same time, 
PAYGo companies could help finan -
cial institutions reach new customers, 
develop lower-cost digital delivery 
models, and better use data/technol -
ogy to manage credit risk. According to 
McKinsey (2018), these will be critical 
success factors for African retail lenders.
The idea is not new, but it is worth repeat -
ing.4 If PAYGo companies can collaborate 
and co-brand with mobile operators on 
the distribution side, why can’t they do 
the same with financial institutions on 
the servicing side? Collaboration could 
feature different levels of operational 
integration and transfer of responsibility, 
which could shift over time as collabora -
tion deepens. Depending on how they are 
structured, these partnerships could also 
allow PAYGo companies to decouple ser -
vicing without completely losing control 
of the customer relationship. Competitor arrangements 
The potential market for entry-level 
household solar is upwards of 50 million 
households. We’ve barely scratched the 
surface of that. If we accept that there is 
room for numerous companies in many 
markets and that servicing is a key part 
of solving the energy access challenge, 
then it might make sense for competi -
tors to work together. 
Bilateral arrangements are one option. 
Although execution may be compli -
cated, competing PAYGo companies 
could install backup systems and pro -
vide regular data updates to a trusted 
third party. If a predefined emergency 
(the terms of which would be spelled 
out in the loan agreement) occurs, the 
competitor could access those systems 
and begin servicing its competitor’s 
clients.
However, the preferred option is to 
enhance technical standardization and 
interoperability in the sector. If data 
structure and communication protocols 
in PAYGo systems are harmonized, one 
PAYGo company could simply purchase 
the portfolio of a struggling competi -
tor and seamlessly assume servicing its BOX 3. Backup servicing requirements in the PAYGo sector
Because PAYGo servicing comprises a wide array of functions, backup service 
arrangements may not need to replicate each of those functions. Backup services 
could be described as four tiers of activity. Additional services will be more 
expensive, but they could produce higher levels of repayment.
Tier 1.  CRM software, payment processing, and remote lockout. 
Tier 2.  Call-center operations and SMS updates (in addition to all functions of Tier 1).
Tier 3.  Physical maintenance and delinquency management (in addition to all functions 
of Tier 2). 
Tier 4.  Upgrades and cross-selling (in addition to all the functions of Tier 3).
4 See Muench, Waldron, and Faz (2016).18
Taming the Strange Beasts: Servicing and the Future of PAYGooutstanding clients and upgrade well- 
performing customers. 
Either of these options would provide 
high value for end-customers, because 
their new servicer would offer them 
more holistic service (Tiers 1-4) and 
additional financing. 
Specialized PAYGo servicer and a 
PAYGo bank
In the longer term, there may be a busi -
ness case for a dedicated backup servicer 
in the asset financing sector. Function -
ing like backup servicers in auto, mort -
gage, and credit card markets, this entity 
could have preinstalled backup systems. 
It would receive regular data dumps that 
would enable it to process payments and 
manage units on short notice (although 
the former may require more planning/
integration with the payment operator). 
The addition of a call center that could 
reroute service calls to the originator 
would be an important step in assuag -
ing customer concerns, as would a pro- 
active messaging strategy. A field service 
team with some backup inventory would 
complete the operation, but this may 
be unnecessary for shorter-term loans. 
Service options including Tiers 2, 3, and 
4 could all be made available on short 
notice.However, because the sector is small, 
the specialized servicer may have to be 
donor-supported initially or operate as 
a subsidiary of a larger organization. 
The first option could serve as an imme -
diate mitigant in core PAYGo markets. 
It could also transition into the second 
option: a servicing company operating 
within a bank for PAYGo companies. 
That PAYGo bank could have the follow -
ing attributes: 
■■Management by experienced PAYGo 
veterans
■■Mobilization of local deposits from 
PAYGo companies and other asset 
companies
■■Ability to raise wholesale debt from 
local banks to complement deposits
■■Core banking systems that are 
designed to handle PAYGo cash flows
■■Subsidiaries that support clients with 
a variety of business-to-business ser -
vices, such as backup servicing or 
credit analytics
Working closely with such a financial 
institution would help PAYGo compa -
nies to access cheaper funds, streamline 
their financial reporting, and optimize 
their operations.19
Taming the Strange Beasts: Servicing and the Future of PAYGoRECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSION
Our research and experience prompt the 
following recommendations:
■■Industry stakeholders need to rec -
ognize that expanding the servicing 
ecosystem beyond originators is a 
crucial step in the development of 
the PAYGo sector.
■■Donors should direct more fund -
ing to develop backup servicing 
arrangements. While this may not be 
as glamorous as deploying new solar 
units, it will better enable the sec -
tor to scale while also strengthening 
companies’ resiliency. 
■■Debt investors should understand 
the risks they are taking and how 
these relate to the rest of the PAYGo 
value chain. They should push PAYGo 
companies to better mitigate servic -
ing risk.
■■PAYGo providers need to find a way 
to standardize and outsource certain 
activities without disrupting their 
overall functions. Creating captive 
FinCos, developing partnerships 
with established financial institu -
tions, or even simply delinking their 
product and loan servicing are all 
viable ways to help the sector scale 
more sustainably.
■■Financial institutions that want to 
expand their retail operations need 
to develop partnerships with PAYGo 
companies to leverage their com -
bined strengths. Donors and devel -
opment finance institutions should 
use their funding to catalyze and 
support these partnerships.
■■Creating industrywide standards for 
PAYGo hardware and software would 
allow for rapid servicing migration and alleviate many of the risks pre -
sented in this paper.
Servicing is the beating heart of PAYGo’s 
“strange beasts.” Companies must deter -
mine how to retain the dynamism and 
quality service that enabled their suc -
cess, which may include letting go of the 
parts of their businesses that others can 
do better. These decisions will deter -
mine the optimal strategies for reaching 
tens of millions of off-grid and unbanked 
households. 
At the same time, investors and compa -
nies need to realize that, in the absence 
of a viable backup servicer, any invest -
ment in PAYGo receivables is a bet on 
the entire value chain. Servicer risk is 
endemic to this and other nascent credit 
sectors, regardless of financing modal -
ity. Whether extending a commercial 
loan backed by receivables, financing 
the receivables themselves, or even 
financing the end solar customer, cred -
itors will need to estimate probability 
of default and loss given default. To do 
that, they need to understand whether 
servicer risk means there is zero recov -
ery in the case of an enterprise collapse 
or if there are backup strategies that can 
collect on outstanding debt.
PAYGo solar is not an average opportu -
nity, and the risks associated with it are 
real. Distributed solar is, for the first time, 
becoming a viable source of energy for 
millions of people. Customers that have 
never and will never see the inside of a 
bank are being approved for the loans 
that they desperately need. However, this 
sector is both too young and too “strange” 
to risk financial disruptions, especially 
unnecessarily. Customers both present 
and future need this to work, and for it to 
work there must be safeguards. 20
