EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
FINTECH COMPANIES COMBINE TECHNOLOGY WITH ACCESS TO 
data to deliver new financial services and experiences to customers. They have been proliferating in emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs), and some are creating solutions specifically for underserved, low-income, or remote customers. Yet for all the general excitement that fintechs have generated in 
the global development community, there is little information available about how specific fintech innovations solve pain points in financial inclusion.
In 2016, CGAP launched a program to understand fintech innovations and draw clear links to 
financial inclusion, where they existed. We supported pilots with 18 fintechs in Africa and South Asia that targeted financial services to low-income or underserved customers. Our goal was to explain innovations in a detailed way and generate insight on whether the services (i) work as stated, (ii) create value for underserved customers, and (iii) ease age-old pain points in delivering financial services to underserved customers. 
This paper is written for funders—whether donors, investors, development finance institutions, 
or philanthropic organizations—who engage with fintechs to advance financial inclusion. Based on CGAP’s work, it identifies five types of fintech innovation that offer potential for financial inclusion. We also highlight challenges that these fintechs, particularly those in early stages, face that inhibit their ability to impact financial inclusion. 
Key Findings 
FINTECHS ARE BRINGING INNOVATION   
TO EVERY PART OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR
The excitement around fintech is not without merit. Fintechs are innovating at every step of the financial services value chain, often through new value propositions, including flexible products and better ways to address the financial challenges faced by low-income customers. They are making financial services more affordable and accessible. They are improving the customer experience of financial services and accelerating use and engagement. They are also building the groundwork—including easier digital identity verification, collaborative customer due diligence, data sharing, and payment schemes—that can catalyze a host of financial services. 2
FINTECHS AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION   |   Executive SummaryFIVE INNOVATION AREAS DISPLAY THE POTENTIAL  
FOR FINTECHS TO IMPACT FINANCIAL INCLUSION  
The following list is not an exhaustive set of innovations in the fintech space, but each 
represents a powerful idea for financial inclusion. While most focus on payments and credit today, we expect there will be a diverse array of products in the future, as providers capture more data about their customers and are able to provide other services at marginal cost: 
Interactive customer engagement.  Fintechs are using SMS and other communication 
tools to reduce the cost and effort of engaging with customers. These tools ease complaint 
resolution, feedback gathering, and information dissemination. The result is greater use, trust, and loyalty. See Table ES1.

Location-based finance.  Fintechs are using satellite data and machine-learning 
techniques to analyze physical location and offer insurance or credit at reduced cost to 
smallholders, who are some of the world’s most excluded groups. See Table ES4.

The funding that reaches EMDEs primarily goes to more established fintechs that have 
proven their business models. Without support from “angel” investors, many early-stage 
fintechs struggle even though they may have potentially game-changing ideas. Supporting 
these fintechs could unlock innovation and produce relevant lessons for the entire financial 
services m arket.
Howeve r, because their business models are unproven, they may be too risky for private 
capital. Global development and impact investing communities can invest patient capital, 
but they may need to take the following steps:
•Br
ing clarity to a crowded marketplace of ideas. Fintech innovation is varied, and
because much of it is new, there is a lack of universal understanding of new business
models and their potential to scale.
•Li
nk solutions to financial inclusion.  There are too few metrics for success and
impact on financial inclusion goals.
•Ex
tract lessons from successes and failures.  Global lessons about how fintechs
attempt to resolve pain points in financial inclusion would provide a realistic sense offintechs’ effects on financial inclusion.4
FINTECHS AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION   |   Executive Summary FINTECHS FACE A UNIVERSAL SET OF INTERNAL CHALLENGES  
Funders should be aware that all fintechs must overcome one or more of these four internal 
challenges, particularly during early-stage innovation:
• Develop a clear value proposition.  Since financial services for the poor are scarce in 
emerging markets and competition is low, fintechs often fail to invest enough time to test 
and articulate their value before launching services.
• Assemble the right human and technological resources. Having all three core 
skills and resources—technology, market insight, and leadership—can be rare for start-
ups in emerging markets. 
• Balance digital and in-person customer interaction.  Ensure underserved 
customers are comfortable using unfamiliar services or technologies that may require 
in-person interactions. However, a business model that relies heavily on physical 
interactions through stores and agents may limit the ability to scale. 
• Form strategic partnerships.  Many early-stage fintechs depend on partnerships to 
get their ideas off the ground, either because they lack scale, capabilities, or adequate 
licensing. However, their newness and size may make it difficult for them to forge 
equitable partnerships with established institutions.
Conclusion 
After two years of experimentation, we see preliminary evidence that fintechs have the 
potential to affect financial inclusion, but more granular research is needed. Going forward, 
CGAP will support the global development sector, policy makers, and the impact investing 
industry by facilitating a common understanding of emerging business models in fintech 
that have the potential to advance financial inclusion. We will also extract granular lessons 
from fintech innovations that can shed light on what creates value for the poor and on the 
limitations of new approaches.  5

INTRODUCTION
A NEW SET OF TECHNOLOGY-BASED COMPANIES ARE 
disrupting the financial  services market globally. Fintechs, as they are called, 
have developed a market presence in the decade since the 2008 financial 
crisis. They have garnered attention because they combine technology with 
access to alternative data and innovative approaches to deliver new kinds of 
financial products, services, and experiences to their customers. They have challenged 
business-as-usual by being nimbler, serving underserved segments, or improving unit 
economics. Their success is reflected in the number of customers that adopt their services 
and how they influence established financial institutions to compete with more innovation 
and more customer-centric features and services (PWC 2017). 
Fintechs often begin as start-ups, but many have scaled dramatically. SoFi, a credit 
marketplace founded in 2011 to offer digital, unsecured loans had issued more than 
US$9 billion in loans by 2016 and expanded to offer personal finance, billing, payments, 
insurance, and even pensions (CNBC 2016). Robo-adviser Betterment uses big data to 
reduce the cost of investing for a large base of U.S. customers.1 It charges customers 
just 0.25 percent of their assets every year and does not require a minimum balance—all 
offered through a user-friendly, interactive interface. After 10 years, Betterment manages 
US$13 billion in investments. 
Until recently, the fintech phenomenon was largely limited to 
developed markets. Now, fintechs are beginning to disrupt 
the financial ecosystem in emerging markets and developing 
economies (EMDEs) as well. While most solutions globally 
still focus on affluent customers who are well served by 
financial services, some fintechs are creating solutions 
specifically designed for underserved low-income customers. 
The rise of fintechs such as PayTM, Zoona, Jumo, and 
Cellulant in EMDE markets inspired CGAP to study them to 
understand their potential effects on financial inclusion. 
Fintech innovation and the role of fintech firms 
Fintechs are not alone in using technology to innovate. The term “fintech innovation” refers 
to activities by a broad range of actors, including incumbent financial institutions, and others. 
In fact, established financial institutions (e.g., banks, credit card companies) around the 
world are using innovative technologies for improving everything from customer complaint

human intervention. They provide digital financial advice based on mathematical rules or algorithmsSome fintechs

FINTECHS AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION   |   Introductionresolutions to fraud control. When innovation is combined with an established institution’s 
scale, brand recognition, and trust, the potential for impact can be high. In practice, however, 
adopting innovation has proven to be challenging for established organizations. Legacy IT 
systems, heavy operational processes that are difficult to change, and a business model that 
relies on physical infrastructure make the cost of transformation high and limits the potential 
for reaching underserved segments. Nevertheless, Equity Bank in Kenya, Capitec in South 
Africa, and DigiBank in South East Asia are examples of established financial institutions that 
use innovative technologies to grow and expand their offering in emerging markets.2
On the other hand, fintechs typically begin as small firms with an innovation culture. Their 
size and newness give them the agility to change and develop infrastructure built for 
digital operations. They have a consumer-centric perspective that is frequently lacking in 
traditional finance. Their survival depends on their effectiveness in bringing an innovation 
to market. Therefore, fintechs can be a driver of competition, diversification of financial 
services offering, and efficiencies in markets. 
A quick look at the kinds  of innovations brought by fintechs reveals another distinction from 
traditional finance institutions. Fintechs often focus on needs not addressed by incumbents 
in the markets they operate in, and therefore they tackle pain points for underserved groups 
(e.g., those without credit scores or those who have a history of default) or groups that are 
dissatisfied with current products (e.g., millennials). In emerging markets, fintech offerings 
often align with financial inclusion goals. 
Despite the distinct effect fintechs could have in markets through new technologies and 
approaches, they often need to partner with established financial institutions to scale. 
Some question whether the numerous and often narrow solutions brought about by 
fintechs could have substantive and cohesive impact. Because of the large number of 
companies and business models emerging, it’s difficult to assess which are most useful 
for financial inclusion. Nonetheless, through their iterations, these companies may open 
doors that have been closed to some customers. The success of a substantial mass of 
fintechs could influence established financial institutions to adopt more efficient approaches, 
broaden the markets they serve, and become more responsive to customer pain points. 
Fintech catalysts in EMDEs are unique 
In developed markets, fintechs benefit from widespread internet access, savvy digital 
customers, and prevalence of digital money. EMDEs generally lack these conditions, but 
fintechs have still managed to do well in several EMDE countries. Some of the following 
factors may explain why: 
• Widespread digital payment schemes have created an enabling infrastructure to bring 
new businesses to market.
• Third-party integration mechanisms have made it easier for innovation to reach customers.
• Rising smartphone penetration has improved customer experience.
• New data sources have enhanced delivery and reduced costs to serve.
• Regulatory sandboxes are beginning to enable safe experimentation.
2 In fact, even governments, most notably the Indian government, have used technology to offer digital 
solutions that enhance the entire national financial services architecture. 7
FOCUS NOTE   |  May 2019
WIDESPREAD DIGITAL PAYMENT SCHEMES
In the past decade, many emerging markets have adopted regulations that allow new 
entrants into the financial services sector, especially in payments. These new players range 
from mobile network operators (MNOs) and electronic money issuers that offer store-of-
value accounts and payments services accessible from any mobile phone. MNOs attract 
vast numbers of agents that conduct cash-in and cash-out functions on behalf of mobile 
money providers and aggregators that facilitate the integration with mobile money platforms. 
Fintechs have used this infrastructure to target customers (i.e., business-to-consumer 
services) or to conduct operations on behalf of large financial institutions (i.e., business-to-
business services). 
THIRD-PARTY INTEGRATION MECHANISMS
Banks and MNOs want to increase their customer base, build deeper customer loyalty, 
and expand use cases for digital transactions, and this has fueled interest to integrate with 
fintechs offering a variety of new services.3 MNOs have enjoyed a growing mobile money 
business, but in many markets, this is somewhat stagnant. Most transactions are focused 
on cash-in and cash-out, person-to-person (P2P) payments, and airtime top-ups (GSMA 
2018). Unless MNOs reach scale and partner with new actors to drive up digital transactions, 
research suggests that the unit profit of mobile money from these services will not justify 
underlying investments and operating costs (Osafo-Kwaako et al. 2018). 
GSMA (2017) reports that MNOs with the highest activity rates are integrated with seven 
banks, 95 billers, and 31 organizations for bulk disbursements and with 6,500 merchants 
(GSMA 2017). Other established financial institutions are doing the same. A PWC (2017) 
global survey of 1,300 senior managers across banks and asset management and 
insurance companies showed that the percentage of these companies partnering with 
fintechs rose from 32 percent in 2016 to 45 percent in 2017. On average, 82 percent of 
those surveyed expect to enter into more partnerships with fintechs over the next three to 
five years. In another example, Absa, a prominent bank in South Africa, announced in 2017 
that it is partnering with nine fintechs to develop a new digital identity that would help it to 
keep pace with growing millennial segments (ABSA n.d.).
The spread of open application programming interfaces (APIs) in EMDEs is likely to promote 
further partnerships between financial services companies and fintechs.4 Globally and across 
sectors, API architecture has dominated the evolution of digital services and is becoming 
increasingly visible in the financial services ecosystem. APIs can significantly reduce the cost 
and time of integration and, thus, reduce the cost of innovation. 
RISING SMARTPHONE PENETRATION  
Smartphone penetration is steadily growing in EMDE markets due, in part, to low-cost 
devices, low-cost data plans, and the availability of tools to compress the size of apps 
and allow for more data use. GSMA (2018) estimates that by 2025, three in four mobile 
connections will operate on smartphones. Smartphones enable services to more directly 
reach consumers through an engaging interface. They also enable more complex 
interactions and allow for more guided customer journeys. 
3 GSMA indicates that increasing the number of digital transactions conducted on accounts (as a ratio per 
cash-in) can generate EBITDA margins of up to 20 percent (Almazan and Vonthron 2014). 
4  APIs enable the interconnection of disparate systems to offer a seamless product or service that relies on 
capabilities of different firms. Open APIs offer commercial terms and conditions that are public, uniformly 
applied, and available to any individual or firm meeting eligibility criteria.8
FINTECHS AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION   |   IntroductionNEW DATA SOURCES  
Customers’ growing digital footprints mean that fintechs can leverage alternative data 
sources—ranging from digital payment records to satellite data to social media behavior—
to market to targeted segments and to build customized credit and insurance models. 
These efforts, when used responsibly, are cost efficient and can expand financial access 
to more people.
REGULATORY SANDBOXES  
Several regulators are allowing private firms to conduct small-scale, live testing of 
innovations in a controlled environment—called sandboxes—by providing a special 
exemption, license, or other limited, time-bound exception under the regulator’s supervision 
(Jenik and Lauer 2017). Countries that permit sandboxes include Sierra Leone, Kenya, 
Jordan, Mexico, and Thailand. These sandboxes encourage firms, including fintechs, to test 
innovative solutions in a safe and discreet environment to understand customers and adjust 
their business models before sorting out what kind of licensing scheme is needed, if any.
Yet, fintech investments in EMDEs are few 
The rapid rise of fintechs and the promise of financial returns have attracted private investors. 
Globally, total venture capital and equity investment going to fintechs have steadily risen at 
above 40 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in the past five years. In 2018, the 
total amount invested in fintech was estimated at US$40 billion across 1700 deals.5 
Most venture capital and equity investments in fintech are in the United States, Europe, 
China, and to a lesser extent in other developed markets (KPMG 2018). As fintechs appear 
the financial services markets in Latin America, Africa, and South Asia, they attract private 
investments, accelerators, and incubators. Notably, companies like PayTM (India), Cellulant 
(Kenya/Nigeria), and Mercado Libre (Argentina)—considered start-ups not long ago—have 
received considerable investment (Sen and Shrutika 2018; Bright 2018).
But much of this investment in emerging markets are in fintechs that are in a growth stage. 
Investment in seed and early-stage start-ups is low, and in the absence of angel and 
philanthropic investing in these markets, many start-ups struggle to survive during crucial 
periods of prototyping and establishing their value proposition. Skewed funding also forces 
companies to be cautious about sharing their data, leading to a dearth of industry-level 
lessons on successes and failures. 
Fintechs bring relevant innovations to the financial 
services sector
Fintechs are innovating at every step of the financial services value chain. Their innovation 
enhances access and use of financial services for underserved, low-income customers. 
They also resolve complex pain points in financial inclusion efforts in emerging markets.

FOCUS NOTE   |  May 2019
Fintechs potentially enhance financial services for the poor in the following ways: 
Better experience . Some fintechs offer services and applications (apps) that improve 
how customers experience financial services, increase their use, and increase trust and 
customer engagement. These services may be offered on smartphone apps or they may 
use simple SMS conversations to observe behavior, offer advice, or provide an interactive 
option for customers to resolve complaints. 
Improved products . Other fintechs improve financial services, such as credit, insurance, 
and pensions, by introducing digital features or creating operational efficiencies that could 
bring greater access and affordability for the end consumer. In the process, they often 
collect better data, which creates more options to further improve products. 
New value propositions . Some fintechs explore how they can combine improvements in 
products and experience to offer entirely new value propositions to underserved customers. 
These services might offer flexibility and customization that was not available before; they 
could also offer new and different solutions that address specific financial challenges 
experienced by low-income customers. 
Fintechs can add to market development in the following ways:
Sound financial infrastructures . Some fintechs help build a foundation that catalyzes 
other financial services. These include services that verify digital identity, ensure 
collaborative customer due diligence, and allow for data sharing and easier payments, 
including cross-border remittance solutions. Because these solutions may be offered to any 
entity within a market, they have a role at the ecosystem level. 
Greater competition and use cases . As fintechs scale, they create greater choice and 
competition in the market. By innovating around the products and experience, they create 
more use cases for digital accounts. 
Lessons from experiments
After our preliminary research, we sought to better understand fintech innovations on 
the ground and draw clear links to financial inclusion, where they exist. We wanted to 
understand innovations in a granular way and generate insights on whether the services 
(i) work as stated, (ii) create value for underserved customers, and (iii) ease age-old pain 
points in delivering financial services to the underserved.FIGURE 1.  Fintech’s effect on the customer and the market

FINTECHS AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION   |   IntroductionThrough a formal selection process that included a public call for proposals, we identified 
18 promising fintechs to study. Each company targeted underserved populations, and all, 
except for three, were based in Africa. The companies were early-stage start-ups; all of 
them, except for one, already had a financial service that had been designed but not tested. 
CGAP funded pilots with each company and provided technical assistance to design 
experiments and analyze results. Since most of these were early-stage companies, each 
pilot involved reaching an average of 1,000 customers. In addition, each pilot had differing 
metrics for success based on the nature of the product. Most pilots had quantitative 
metrics, but some testing was more qualitative. As is the nature of start-up innovation, not 
all pilots were successful. In fact, few were successful in exactly the way we envisioned. 
When successful, we saw the beginnings of an effective company and noteworthy value 
creation for an underserved customer. But some failures, too, revealed important directions 
for future strategy, and these were just as valuable. 
With seven of these start-ups, we also conducted an independent post-pilot evaluation, 
in collaboration with the Busara Center for Behavioral Economics, to measure the value 
created for customers, through interviews with customers and fintech staff. 
This paper details the lessons we learned through this two-year research, piloting,  
and interviews. 
In the first section,  we focus on the innovations, grouped into five innovation areas. Each 
area is connected to a pain point in financial inclusion, and we summarize lessons on what 
it takes for each group to work and scale. 
The second section  moves beyond innovations and discusses common challenges early-
stage fintechs face that inhibit their impact.11
FOCUS NOTE   |  May 2019
EMERGING AREAS  
OF INNOVATION 
We sorted the 18 fintechs we worked with into one of five innovation areas:
• Interactive customer engagement
• Smartphone-based payments 
• Connections-based finance
• Location-based smallholder finance
• De-risking unproductive expenses
These five areas do not encompass all the innovation in this space, but each represents 
an innovative idea for financial inclusion, brought to market through a variety of players in 
different ways, that is experiencing early traction. Table 1 shows the different innovation 
areas. A detailed look at the areas and the pilots follow.
Interactive Customer Engagement 
PAIN POINT
Digital financial services are not interactive because engagement is expensive.  
Early retail financial services were rarely interactive, and a decade ago, we would be hard 
pressed to find senior executives in finance who could talk about their engagement strategy 
with retail customers. In the past decade, fintechs have attracted customers by offering a 
service or product that is easy to reach and interactive. This 
has made incumbent financial institutions take notice and 
improve their offerings. 
But even today, a low-income customer with low-ticket 
transactions in Sub-Saharan Africa or South Asia is unlikely 
to engage with a customer service agent to resolve issues 
with her payment transactions or pensions account. The 
low-cost, no-frills business model employed by banks 
to serve low-income clients doesn’t leave much room 
for communication and engagement. It is expensive to 
ensure customers understand services and trust in them. 
Microfinance institutions (MFIs) and other local financial 
services with high-touch models find it difficult to scale. Fintechs use SMS, 
audio recordings, and 
video along with digital 
analytics and automa -
tion to interact with 
customers on the right 
topics at the right time.SECTION 112
FINTECHS AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION   |   Emerging Areas of Innovation  Low-income customers may experience stress when they use payment services. For 
example, if they mistakenly send half their salary to the wrong account, they may fear that 
they won’t be able to reach someone to help them. Or, they may fear that they won’t be 
able to access their own savings in an emergency. The cost and difficulty of interaction 
also affects products such as microcredit, pensions, and insurance. Either customers do 
not understand the products and stay away, or in-person interaction—which is crucial 
when assessing a low-income customer for a small and medium enterprise loan or when 
providing insurance products to farmers—becomes difficult to scale and therefore leads to 
limited access. 
THE INNOVATION
Fintechs in this area combine communication technologies like SMS, audio recordings, and 
video with digital analytics and automation to interact with customers on the right topics at 
the right time. This improves the customers’ experience with a product or service and can 
lead to the collection of more information, increased engagement, and fast resolution of 
customer complaints. These solutions include chat bots that use SMS and USSD to reach 
customers who do not have smartphones. 
Both business-to-business and business-to-customer variations exist. Some companies 
partner with banks and other financial services providers (FSPs) to improve their customer 
engagement and make their services accessible and targeted. Others target the end 
customer directly with engagement that acts as a gateway to other services. Still others use 
information and communication technologies to make complex financial services like credit, 
insurance, and pensions easier to understand and to use. In each case, the customer has 
greater access to information and an easy access point of contact should they have issues 
with their service. TABLE 1.  Innovations, fintechs, and services addressed in this paper

THE SERVICES  
Juntos 
Juntos  uses mobile messaging to interact with customers and build greater engagement 
between them and their FSP, such as a bank or a mobile money provider. Juntos does not 
offer financial services directly to customers. It has contracts with FSPs that need help getting 
over a pain point or that are launching a new product. Juntos helps these FSPs engage their 
customers more deeply, educate their customers, and improve use rates. 
Juntos uses a centralized and automated messaging service that sends messages to a large 
customer base. As customers reply, the service responds with individualized responses 
based on customer messages. Because more than 90 percent of messages are automated, 
providers can offer standardized information, with customized interaction, to their customers 
at a very low cost. Through these messages, Juntos establishes relationships with customers 
on behalf of the FSP, informs them about new services, and offers them tips and guidance 
to access and use a product effectively. Customers respond with questions or issues they 
face and receive real-time automated responses from Juntos. The pilot studied the effect of 
Juntos’ interaction with customers in their use of certain financial services. 
Arifu
Arifu in Kenya uses mobile messaging to offer topic-based learning to low-income customers. 
It partners with FSPs to offer their current and potential customers financial information in 
a cost-effective way and uses these interactions to direct customers to specific financial 
services offered by the FSP. Interactions with customers are structured around learning 
topics such as “setting financial goals” or “expanding your business.” Customers navigate 
content on their messaging app, which Arifu makes available in simple bits. At the end of 
an information module, customers take a test that measures and tracks learning progress. 
If an FSP partner can integrate its customer data with the Arifu platform, Arifu can tailor 
its messaging to suit specific business goals, such as reducing dormancy and increasing 
use. The pilot tested how well Arifu’s platform identified and profiled FSP customers and its 
potential to improve customers’ engagement with financial services and products. 
Services like Juntos and Arifu interact with customers and tailor communications based 
on customers’ responses. In places with deeper smartphone access among low-income 
customers, these services may begin to use more visual and video-based formats and test 
for greater engagement. 
People’s Pension Trust 
People’s Pension Trust (PPT), in Ghana, is a fully licensed pensions company that offers 
pensions to informal workers, ranging from urban market vendors to rural cocoa farmer 
associations. While PPT is not a conventional fintech, its core product (a long-term 
savings plan) depends on a digital customer interaction strategy to drive customers 
toward constant savings. 
Informal workers have volatile incomes and find it hard to save regularly for their old age. 
Without adequate information and interaction on how pension products work, saving for old 
age quickly becomes a low priority. On the other hand, with the prospect of a low rate of 
voluntary contributions, it is hard for pension companies to find a business model that works. 
Through its customer research, PPT found that low-income informal workers want to have 
safety nets for themselves. Workers who had access to a pension scheme often stayed 
away from it because they did not know how the schemes worked. PPT hypothesized that 14
FINTECHS AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION   |   Emerging Areas of Innovation  regular and low-cost interaction with customers would increase customers’ understanding 
of the value of pensions and help scale its business, albeit gradually. 
In our pilot, PPT conducted extensive behavioral testing to understand which digital 
strategies—SMS, calls, automatic deductions, etc.—would best complement physical 
interactions and be a low-cost way to encourage customers to use its pension product. At 
the end of the pilot, each of the treatment groups had greater engagement with PPT than 
the control group did, showing that digital nudges tailored to specific segments could 
improve contributions. 
This pilot showed that for a new and evolving product, an interactive channel can be used to 
support onboarding and respond to feedback and requests for new features from customers. 
Apollo Agriculture , a fintech that provides loans to farmers in Kenya, tested SMS and 
automated calls to nudge farmers to repay their loans and to offer agronomic advice. 
Although purely behavioral nudges were not effective at incentivizing early repayment, 
interventions involving lotteries where farmers participated by making a partial payment did 
prove to incentivize small prepayments. NALA , a fintech that provides a payments app in 
Tanzania, effectively embedded WhatsApp as a customer touchpoint. 
CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR SUCCESS
1. Safeguarding customer data. Since many of these fintechs communicate with 
customers of an established financial institution that has an established brand 
and fiduciary responsibilities, they need to be responsible communicators to their 
customers and keep customer data safe. FSP concerns around competition and 
customer ownership need to be resolved upfront, particularly if cross-selling is involved. 
Without adequate provisions and obligations, FSPs will find it difficult to trust a third 
party with customer communications. 
2. Integrating systems and data exchange. To demonstrate success, these fintechs 
need to measure the effects of their customer interactions along business metrics, 
whether for themselves or for their FSP contractors. If this is done in-house, the 
process is straightforward. However, if measurement involves a contractual relationship, 
then FSPs must provide adequate access to their data and the fintech must create the 
necessary infrastructure to enable dataset analysis. In the Juntos pilot, it was essential 
to test many iterations of messages, and this required frequent access to business 
data. System-level integration can increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the 
process of tailoring dialogues and maximizing impact. 
3. Choosing an appropriate channel.  Because appropriate channels, whether SMS, 
multimedia, or voice call, are important elements of this model, customer capability 
and existing infrastructure need to be assessed. Juntos and Arifu rely on simple SMS 
messaging while PPT uses different channels for different segments—one segment 
receives SMS messages and another receives voice calls and in-person interactions. 
Smartphone-based content can be more visually appealing, and it can be tested where 
smartphone prevalence among underserved customers is high enough. 
4. Iterative testing.  Even if the channel is right, messages need to be tailored to effectively 
communicate with a specific audience. Juntos invests considerable time on A/B testing 
to determine what content and language to use in different anticipated situations. 6 Arifu 
6 A/B testing is comparing two versions of a service to see which one performs better15

also conducts preliminary research with customers before it designs its learning content. 
In its pilot, PPT worked with four treatment groups, each with its own form of nudge or 
incentive, in addition to a control group to determine the right strategy. 
5. Determining an adequate price point for these services. The price for these 
services must be commensurate to the incremental value produced for the business 
by the interactions. Fintechs must be able to measure and track the impact of their 
customer engagement on the FSP’s business and price their services accordingly.
Smartphone-Based Payments 
PAIN POINT
Poorly designed user interfaces contribute to dormancy in payment accounts. 
Mobile money can reduce the operational costs for delivering financial services to the 
underserved. The proliferation of mobile phones and mobile money or bank agents has 
resulted in scores of mobile money accounts being opened. However, many of these are 
dormant, and dormant accounts erode the business case 
for serving the poor. In some cases, negative experiences 
from working through long USSD menus and clunky 
interfaces keep users away from digital financial services 
(Chen, Fiorillo, and Hanouch 2016). 
THE INNOVATION
The term “next billion” is used to define internet users 
coming online in the next few years. Most of these users are 
in emerging markets, and of these, most are low-income 
millennials who will go online using a mobile phone 
(Sengupta 2018). Google, the global search engine and 
creator of the Android Operating System, believes that, given their low literacy and lack of 
experience with digital technologies, most next billion users are unlikely to email or read 
content. Google predicts that, instead, these users will communicate in a combination of 
languages and consume services via voice recognition, video, and images. 
Low-end smartphones and low-cost data plans are spreading rapidly through Asia and 
parts of Africa, representing a significant opportunity for FSPs to create more compelling 
interfaces that can help users better understand and trust digital payments services. 
Fintechs are creating smartphone apps that are fun, simple, and engaging and that 
leverage intuitive user interface or user experience (UI/UX) to build user confidence in digital 
payments and encourage greater use. 
Some of these companies create payment services that use simple text and voice 
recognition and communicate with images. Others have tutorials and helplines built into 
their apps to help customers. Intuitive UI/UX helps users navigate the service despite 
poor literacy. While good visuals often require higher bandwidth, fintechs are creating 
visually compelling apps that work in environments with slow data connections and low 
storage capabilities (Bellman 2017). Most of these are payment apps, but intuitive UI/
UX methodology is increasingly being applied to other financial services offered on a 
smartphone (Chen 2016).Fintechs are deliver -

Wave Money
CGAP partnered with Wave Money in Myanmar to use principles of human-centered design 
to develop and test a mobile wallet app for smartphones (80 percent of mobile devices 
in Myanmar are smartphones). 7 (See Figure 2 for examples of Wave’s app interface.) A 
series of iterative tests was conducted to learn how low-income users understand the 
smartphone app interface and its features and to identify the interfaces users found to be 
easy to operate. The results led Wave Money to identify a set of principles that can help 
developers design apps that feel more natural for customers, especially for customers who 
are new to digital services.8 
FIGURE 2.  Wave Money screens
NALA
Some of the lessons learned from the Wave Money pilot were used in a pilot with NALA 
and Hover in Tanzania. NALA is a smartphone app that works offline (powered by 
USSD in the background) to encourage customers who have smartphones with limited 
data packages to make mobile payments. Its partner, Hover, provides developers the 
technology to integrate mobile money into their applications, even when APIs and for 
payment integration do not exist. 
The pilot tested how customers interacted with simple payment features, including 
budgeting tools, transaction history, and management of several SIMs securely—features 
not generally available on USSD menus. We used knowledge gathered from customer 
workshops and feedback from customers participating in the pilot to create an app that 
is tailored to meet customer’s needs and preferences. The app proved to be particularly 
useful for customers making complex transactions (such as bill payments, which requires 
capturing multiple data). The smartphone interface listed the services available and the

number or account number (see Figure 3).
FIGURE 3.  NALA application screens
Fundu
In another project, we worked with Eko Financial Services in India to pilot Fundu , an app 
that gives customers a secure and fast way to get cash from fellow Fundu users and cash 
points, on the go. The app uses the Unified Payments Interface and is targeted at India’s 
approximately 400 million customers who have recently acquired smartphones and have 
bank accounts, but who primarily earn and spend in cash because there are surprisingly few 
cash-out points (ATMs). 9 For these customers, daily access to cash is critical. In response, 
Fundu promises to facilitate cash-on-demand when and where the customer needs it. The 
app has the potential to build consumer confidence in other digital financial services. 
Fundu’s interface is designed to enhance and facilitate person-to-person interaction using the 
three key components that are typically available on any smartphone: location (Google Maps), 
relationships (contact book), and time (clock). The pilot tested how these features would help 
to facilitate key steps in the customer journey. Users make a request for cash, and the app 
finds another user who is physically near and willing to exchange e-money for cash (users can 
also exchange e-money for cash from someone in their contact book or an ATM or an Eko 
agent). Once a match is made, the app indicates how long it will take the seeker to reach the 
provider’s location. When the pilot launched, each point of customer drop-off was recorded, 
and the app designers iterated on design in response. (See Figure 4.) Note that because Eko 
marketed Fundu as an ATM, the company ran into regulatory issues, and Fundu is no longer 
functional in the market.
9 The Unified Payment Interface enables all bank account holders in India to send and receive money in-
stantly from their smartphones without the need to enter bank account information or user ID/ password

CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR SUCCESS
1. Intensive iterative testing . Since the success of each service hinges on users finding 
the app easy to use and intuitive, fintechs must invest in several rounds of direct user 
testing to determine how features look and feel to underserved customers and whether 
they encourage greater use. 
2. In-app assistance and validation for crucial steps. A key barrier for some 
customers is fear of making a mistake, such as typing the wrong number, and losing 
their money. Providing clarity and validation along the way is crucial. An easy-to-reach 
customer helpline can prevent drop offs. 
3. Data infrastructure . In many emerging markets, even if smartphone penetration 
is high, there might still be low connectivity where underserved customers live. Data 
packages may be expensive for the low-income customer, and customers may use 
data sparingly, which poses a challenge for these kinds of applications. Several fintechs 
try to mitigate this by having apps that run on low data or even use USSD infrastructure 
where connectivity is low. 
4. Networks . The success of apps like Fundu hinges on the availability of a large 
acceptance network that can make requests for cash and respond to them. This is 
often not easy to build from scratch, and while Eko was working to expand its user 
base, it also relied on an existing agent network to facilitate customer acquisitions in 
the beginning. 
5. Business models . Fintechs often begin with the design and experience of the 
app and the need to drive use and engagement. The business model is not always 
determined from the start, but soon enough, these companies will need to determine 
their revenue and cost factors to have a sustainable business model. This makes it 
hard to find early-stage funding for such innovations.19
FOCUS NOTE   |  May 2019
Connections-Based Finance 
PAIN POINT
Low-income people cannot easily access cheap, timely credit to fill cash-flow gaps.
Traditional financial institutions often view low-income people as uncreditworthy because 
they do not have formal credit or payment transaction histories. Nonetheless, low-income 
people often have complex financial lives that involve financial relationships with others in 
their community, their profession, or their families. These informal 
financial relationships are undocumented and deeply rooted in the 
social context. But as several studies based on financial diaries 
have shown, low-income people’s informal financial behavior can 
demonstrate financial acumen, application of complex strategies, 
and varied risk appetites. 
Low-income people often need small amounts of cash for 
emergencies and to smooth expenses in times of low cash flows. 
They often turn to savings groups where pooled savings offer 
access to finance when needed. Some experiments to formalize 
and scale these groups have succeeded, notably in India, but 
operation costs to scale are high, and many remain informal. The lack of access to a 
customer’s payments record inhibits linkages with formal financial institutions. 
THE INNOVATION
Fintechs in this group use digital technologies to create or leverage connections between 
individuals to build creditworthiness and offer  credit  to low-income people to fill cash-flow 
gaps. These fintechs help customers connect to their savings groups and keep an 
electronic record of their payment behavior. They also help customers connect with others 
in their network or beyond when cash is needed for an emergency. Some fintechs use data 
generated from these connections and transactions to help customers—whether individuals 
or entrepreneurs—to access small and timely amounts of credit. Small amounts keep credit 
risk low. The timeliness of credit is key to helping customers better plan for cash-flow gaps 
and emergencies. 
THE SERVICES
MaTontine 
MaTontine, in Senegal, uses a mobile payments platform to digitize traditional savings circles 
(known locally as “tontines”). Tontines typically involve a group of customers saving a fixed 
amount monthly and a given member receiving the ensuing lump sum on a rotating or 
random basis. These monthly contributions continue until every customer has “won” once. 
MaTontine adapts the natural pattern of payments and winnings of the tontine to provide small 
loans to regular members. Loans are repaid when customers win the lump-sum contribution. 
The MaTontine pilot tested whether the cost of borrowing could be reduced because of 
lower risk and whether, with regular payments, MaTontine could build payment histories 
of each customer and eventually offer larger loans and other financial services as the 
customer relationship grows. The pilot showed that the ability to borrow against a foreseen 
win allows customers to use part of the funds in a planned way that suits them (as opposed 
to waiting their turn, which could be January or December, and then hurriedly using the 
cash when it comes). This leads to more short-term stability in their homes and businesses. Fintechs are using 
digital technologies to 
connect individuals and 
to build creditworthi -
ness and offer credit  
to low-income people.20
FINTECHS AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION   |   Emerging Areas of Innovation  MaTontine relies on FSP partners to provide loans and other financial services. Once it 
builds the financial histories of its customers, it can create better, stronger partnerships or 
provide services directly. 
Social Lender
Social Lender, in Nigeria, offers digital credit based on social reputation. Typically, 
low-income customers in Nigeria must put up traditional forms of collateral to secure a 
loan. Social Lender asks customers for access to their social network instead of collateral. 
Applicants share their contact information, and in turn, these social contacts validate the 
applicant’s identity, and they sometimes agree to guarantee a portion of the applicant’s 
loan. The pilots tested two versions of the Social Lender product: an SMS-based product 
targeted at the lowest income customers and a web-based product (with Sterling Bank) 
that required customers to connect their social media accounts with a smartphone or 
computer. The latter targeted customers who had bank accounts but who did not qualify 
for the bank’s traditional credit products. The scores based on this social data appeared 
to correctly rank borrowers in terms of default risk: borrowers with higher social scores 
showed lower default rates on their loans. 
M-Changa
M-Changa is an online fundraising platform that allows customers to leverage their 
connections digitally to access funds. M-Changa does not offer loans; rather, it helps 
customers to source social giving (known as “harambees” in Kenya) from people on a digital 
platform, when they have immediate cash needs for life events like marriage or funerals. The 
platform makes it easy to crowdsource funds because customers can readily access their 
networks and even expand to their network’s network when a cash-flow emergency arises. 
In this pilot, M-Changa and the Busara Center for Behavioral Economics conducted a series 
of experiments with current and potential customers in Kibera, Nairobi, to better understand 
the factors that motivate people to contribute to harambees. The goal was to understand how 
technology can reduce costs and expand networks within harambees, without taking away 
core elements, such as the social connections and sense of giving, that have traditionally 
driven engagement within them.
Pezesha
A pilot with person-to-person lending company Pezesha, in Kenya, sought to better 
understand the value of peers as a source of capital for loans. The goal was to find out 
whether receiving a loan from a fellow Kenyan, rather than a bank, changed the likelihood of 
borrowers repaying the loan (e.g., because of people feeling more obliged to the lender). Pilot 
results did not support any statistically significant difference in repayment rates based on the 
origin of funds, though other peer-lending services with different features could prove to be 
successful. Since the pilot, Pezesha has shifted its business model to focus on a social-circle-
based marketplace for financial education to help underserved borrowers build their credit 
scores and to connect them with institution lenders to ensure long-term scale on both the 
demand and supply side of the marketplace. 
Patasente
Patasente is an online merchant platform in Uganda that connects different points of a 
goods and services supply chain so that participants can bring their businesses online, 
purchase goods, settle payments, and secure invoice financing. The businesses on 
Patasente’s platform range from smallholder dairy farmers to large corporations, but the 
pilot focused on microbusinesses. 21
FOCUS NOTE   |  May 2019
Microbusinesses often face cash-flow gaps if their buyers cannot pay them when the 
supplies they ordered are delivered. In turn, buyers struggle to find reliable suppliers that can 
deliver a product and wait 30–90 days for payment. Microbusinesses cannot access credit 
from their buyers or banks because they lack collateral. Patasente secures interim financing 
for suppliers by assessing the credit worthiness of their buyers through reverse invoice 
factoring. Funding is secured through private lenders who are offered competitive returns.10 
This pilot tested the strength of the credit score Patasente used to make its platform-
matching work. A USSD version of the platform was tested with dairy farmers to explore 
whether this service could be rolled out to customers who do not have smartphones. As 
in the Fundu pilot, the success of Patasente services is based on two-sided or multi-sided 
networks and depends on growing each side robustly and having adequate connections. 11 
The Patasente model also calls for building strong credit scores for each buyer and finding 
investors who agree to assess risk based on the credit score and lend.
CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR SUCCESS
1. Building a robust user network and credible scores. The biggest challenge 
for each of the companies is to prove its ability to scale its user networks and the 
connections between them and then to prove that the credit models based on the 
connected transactions are sound, to attract greater investment. However, this appears 
to be a chicken-and-egg dilemma, because to show scale and build strong credit 
models, companies need to have funds to iterate and pilot various models with various 
customer segments and to generate proof points to scale. 
2. Lending small. Since most services involve lending based on pooled risks or proxy 
scores and are geared at establishing identity and creditworthiness, they carry some 
risk and are generally better suited for quick, short-term cash flow issues rather than 
larger loans. 
Location-Based Smallholder Finance 
PAIN POINT
Most of the world’s 500 million smallholder households cannot be appropriately 
assessed by traditional credit and insurance service providers. 
More than 500 million families around the world rely primarily on smallholder agriculture 
for their livelihoods. Many are underserved by formal financial services. However, many 
financial institutions do not have the tools to properly assess risk in agricultural settings, and 
therefore, they devote disproportionately lower shares of their loan portfolios to agriculture 
compared to the sector’s share of GDP. 
Lack of access to finance, which is partly related to a lack of risk mitigation tools for 
weather, yield, or other risks, forces many farmers to purchase low-quality inputs or 
insufficient amounts, which limits yields and keeps their income low. Some smallholder 
farmers obtain loans from informal lenders or through buyer’s credit—both are expensive 
options that often require some form of collateral (assets or future crops). Since most 
10 For the pilot, Patasente had no history on these supply chains, so it used physical records from the past 
to build credit scores to test its platform through one round of invoice-based loans. 
11 Both Eko Fundu and Patasente need two or more distinct groups of users to join the platform. 22
FINTECHS AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION   |   Emerging Areas of Innovation  smallholders live in the informal economy, they make few formal financial transactions, 
which means that they don’t have the credit history needed to qualify for formal credit. 
Even when they have access to credit, many farmers hesitate to take loans to buy 
high-quality inputs. Many depend on rain-based agriculture, and the changing patterns 
in weather from climate change make them vulnerable not only to losing their inputs but 
to ending up in debt. Because of this, area yield insurance is important for smallholder 
farmers. It uses yield information to insure against weather patterns that reduce yields (e.g., 
little rain during the planting season). However, delivery models for area yield insurance are 
labor intensive, costly, and often unaffordable for smallholder farmers.
THE INNOVATION
Fintechs are using digital technologies and alternative data sources to reduce cost and 
expand access to financial and extension services to smallholder farmers. The specific 
digital technologies and sources of data can vary, from using machine learning on large 
quantities of payment data, to using remote sensing and 
geospatial technologies (primarily satellite images and Global 
Positioning System [GPS] coordinates) to improve credit-risk 
analysis, monitor yields to inform insurance payoffs, and provide 
agronomic advice to enhance farmers’ creditworthiness. 
The statistical models that drive these services require many 
years of varied data and application in different climatic regions 
to ensure reliable conclusions . These companies need to attract 
“patient” venture capital based on the strength of their ideas to 
test, apply, and scale their models. Even if only a few of these 
fintechs succeed, they will radically change access to finance 
for a large, chronically underserved population. 
THE SERVICES
For more than other innovations, the viability of these services depends on the quality of 
the data and the technologies and analytics applied to design the service. There is a wide 
variety of experimentation afoot in this space, which should render good lessons for the 
future. However, there are few examples of strong, scalable business models. 
Farmdrive
Farmdrive in Kenya provides loans to farmers. The pilot tested how satellite data could 
improve Farmdrive’s credit risk models. The biggest challenge was addressing inaccurate 
farmer locations. Because addresses in rural Kenya are not precise, a farmer’s plot cannot 
be pinned to a satellite map at a sufficiently granular level. Therefore, satellite data did little 
to help Farmdrive assess farmers for loans. However, data analyses did produce a model 
that was able to predict yields from maize crops—one of the most commonly planted crops 
in Kenya. The pilot tested the hypothesis that there is potential for satellite data to inform 
predictions of farmers’ income and repayment capacity if issues around farmer location 
could be resolved. 
Apollo Agriculture
Apollo Agriculture, also in Kenya, uses satellite imagery to assess credit risk for smallholder 
farmers. Apollo gathers data on the exact size and location of each farmer’s plot using 
the GPS on a smartphone to ensure that the farmer’s actual field is reviewed. The pilot 
was launched during Apollo’s first lending season, in which it used a minimal underwriting Fintechs are using

FOCUS NOTE   |  May 2019
process to establish an unbiased data set to develop its credit model. It then applied the 
credit model ex-post to assess its predictive power. Although satellite data performed well, 
results could not be fully generalized because they rely on a specific season and its weather 
pattern in that year. To develop robust models, Apollo will collect data from more seasons 
and geographic locations. It also plans to test other data sources that are less prone to 
sample biases, in addition to satellite data. 
Pula
Insurance businesses for smallholder households are mired with high operation costs. 
Current business models for yield-based insurance call for sampling agricultural yields 
at a community level.12 This involves high delivery costs and limits scale, leading to high 
prices for end customers. Pula is a fintech that is experimenting with satellite data to create 
efficiencies to achieve a lower price for the end customer. Like the credit companies, Pula 
sought to build a new algorithm based on existing yield and insurance data along with 
new satellite data to drastically reduce the need for yield sampling and to lower the cost of 
reaching smallholders in remote rural areas (Hernandez, Goslinga, and Wang 2018). 13 
The pilot initially focused on developing an algorithm that predicts individual farmer yields 
with satellite data. However, the data proved to be less predictive, and the focus shifted 
to creating an algorithm that defines larger units of area insured, which translates into 
important operational savings for area-yield index insurance products. 
CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR SUCCESS
1. Building strong models based on varied data and application. I t is difficult to 
reach robust conclusions on the predictive power of satellite data for credit risk analysis 
or for building yield models, especially for follow-up seasons after the pilot, given that 
start-ups are very new and have limited historical data. Although some of the tests did 
well, the results could not be generalized because of insufficient variability in datasets 
and concerns with overfitting to small amounts of data. 14 Therefore, the statistical 
models that drive such services require more years of varied data and application in 
different climatic regions before conclusions can be made.
 For example, to predict drought in an area, we will need to look at rainfall across several 
years along with any correlating factors. A model based on only one year of data will 
predict the same outcome for the following year, since it has no other data points to 
rely on. Because there is no variability in the data (i.e., if it rained, then it will always rain, 
if it didn’t, then it will never) the model will artificially look very accurate. The statistical 
models that were produced require more years of data and application in different 
climatic regions to ensure that conclusions are reliable. 
 In general, machine-learning models require a high volume of cross-section and 
temporal data at a relatively granular level. The results of the machine-learning-based 
models are difficult to interpret. Ways to explore and better understand the features of 
these models are yet to be proven. 
12 Generally, the field sampling required by insurers to determine average yields in each community or unit 
of area insured is costly and imposes a heavy logistical burden. In the Pula example, farm yield measure-
ments were notoriously expensive, with each costing US$25–50. 
13 Pula collected over 1,000 direct yield measurements across several North-Central Nigerian states and com-
piled about 15,000 yield measurements from the past seven years from local agribusiness partners who 
work with smallholders. The data included GPS coordinates and variables related to seed and fertilizer use.
14 In statistics, overfitting happens when the model uses data that are so specific that the analysis cannot be 
generalized to make reliable future predictions that use additional data that are subsequently generated. 24
FINTECHS AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION   |   Emerging Areas of Innovation  2. Bundling with other financial products to improve product economics. 
Bundling yield insurance with input credit improves the economics of agricultural 
products. In the case of Apollo Agriculture, bundling allowed it to recover losses from 
nonperforming loans to farmers who had poor yields due to severe droughts; this 
solution was highly valued by the farmers. However, bundling can also make it difficult 
to adequately explain the product to customers and to make sure they understand the 
features of the combined product. For instance, in the case of Apollo, some farmers 
who took loans did not fully understand how the insurance product worked, which 
sometimes led them to believe they did not need to pay back their loan if there was 
drought in their area (the insurance covered part of the loan depending on the severity 
of the loses caused by draught). 
De-Risking Unproductive Expenses 
PAIN POINT
Low-income people often must meet sizable, unexpected expenses that are hard 
to finance through traditional credit. 
Certain (often sizable) expenses cannot be avoided—paying a doctor when someone gets 
sick, buying seeds and fertilizer when planting season begins, or paying tuition fees at 
the beginning of the school year. Low-income people struggle to save the money to pay 
those expenses, even when these expenses are expected, but especially when they are 
unexpected. Irregular income flows and the sizeable nature 
of the expense often mean that funds are not available when 
payments need to be made. Not having access to finance can 
have dire consequences when low-income people are faced 
with a medical emergency or when a farmer misses a planting 
cycle. These needs underline the vulnerability of poor and 
low-income customers.
Providers lending for these needs take on higher risk because 
the size of the loan can be large and there is either no income 
or highly unpredictable income associated with the expense. 
Traditionally, this would constitute “consumer finance”; however, 
in the case of poor people, the term does not reflect the 
seriousness of these situations. Few business models serve 
customers appropriately in their time of need (better than informal sources) and recover 
these loans, maintain operations, and scale at the same time. 
THE INNOVATION
To counter this pain point, fintechs use technology to reduce the credit risk of financing big, 
unexpected expenses so that the end customers can access key services, such as farm 
inputs, education, or health services, when they need them. 
There are a few different ways to do this. They could reduce risk by preventing loan 
diversion (using money for a different purpose). For example, some services ensure that the 
customer never receives the actual loan in cash by enabling direct access to the service. 
For big expenses, such as farm inputs or solar energy units, companies may rely on proven 
capacity to save (deposits or collaterals). In other cases, the product allows funds to be 
used only at qualified locations, such as health clinics, or at a specific time, such as at the Fintechs are helping

start of the school year. Sometimes repayment is tied to digital or automatic mechanisms. 
In other cases, bundling finance with savings, insurance, and other products reduces risk 
and improves the business model. 
In each case, digital payments and mobile communications enable tailored product 
features, better data generation for future loans, and better timing and servicing to ensure 
the customer can access basic services or inputs when they need them, and investors’ 
finance is de-risked. These services leverage basic technology to help expand access to 
basic services. The pilots showed that customers repay their loans so that they can access 
loans later. While models are still emerging, and lessons are just beginning to take shape, 
these types of products have the potential for substantial development impact. 
THE SERVICES
MicroEnsure
MicroEnsure designed Fearless Health to help low-income customers manage minor health 
events that would otherwise disrupt their lives. This integrated insurance and credit product 
helps customers get the inpatient and outpatient care they need—without having to delay 
treatment because of costs. Fearless Health offers on-demand loans for primary healthcare 
at outpatient clinics, medical advice by phone (whereby customers use SMS to text their 
health questions and then receive a call from a doctor), and insurance for inpatient care 
that provides a cash payout if a customer or family member has a health emergency that 
requires staying three or more nights at a hospital. Limiting the insurance component to 
inpatient care only, while offering loans for outpatient needs, allowed MicroEnsure to keep 
premiums low because administrative costs related to outpatient claims tend to drive up 
premiums. By bundling financial products in this way, MicroEnsure hoped customers could 
experience the benefits of insurance without having to make costly, separate insurance 
premium payments.
MicroEnsure viewed the loans as the key way to introduce customers to Fearless Health’s 
other features. It marketed the loans at participating clinics to help patients cover the 
cost of their treatments. Borrowers were insured and had access to the telephone health 
information service during their loan repayment periods. Mobile money is essential to 
this model, and all payments to and from customers are digital. From MicroEnsure’s 
perspective, cash is not viable given the potential for making several payouts per client 
and receiving regular loan repayments from them. For customers, receiving loans and 
hospital cash payouts quickly via digital channels was critical so they could pay for 
immediate expenses. 
The pilot tested the bundle and identified areas for improvement. It showed that 
MicroEnsure’s plan to offer credit to patients when they were at the clinics and needed 
it most should be reconsidered. Most patients at clinics had already brought enough 
cash to cover minor outpatient expenses. The target market for Fearless Health did not 
bother going to clinics because they do not have the funds to pay for medical services. 
MicroEnsure learned from the pilot that it needs to find ways to market the product outside 
of clinics. 
Tulaa
Tulaa , a technology start-up in Kenya, provides inputs on credit to smallholder farmers and 
brokers the sale of their crops at harvest time. Its digital platform enables farmers to order 
agricultural inputs such as fertilizers and to apply for a loan to purchase the inputs. Tulaa 
conducts a credit assessment using a proprietary tool that is based on alternative data. If 26
FINTECHS AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION   |   Emerging Areas of Innovation  the loan is approved, Tulaa pays the nearest retailer for the stock and sends an electronic 
voucher to the farmer for collection. The average loan size is US$150 and is tied specifically 
to fertilizer, seed, and crop protection products. 
At the time the pilot launched, Tulaa was not underwriting the loans itself; rather, it worked 
through local MFIs. The pilot included determining Tulaa’s performance in sourcing loans 
and getting them sanctioned. The pilot used techniques that prevented loan diversion and 
nudges and incentives to save collateral and repay to measure how Tulaa could influence 
higher loan repayment. 
Biolite
Biolite is an energy company that provides low-income customers in Kenya, Uganda, 
and India access to cooking, charging, and lighting devices. At the time of purchase of 
the Biolite products, when customers owe the full payment, Biolite partner MFIs provide 
customers with financing to afford the devices. The pilot tested the predictive nature and 
effectiveness of credit underwriting based solely on the use of Entrepreneurial Finance 
Lab’s (EFL ’s) psychometric scoring tool. It would allow partner MFI Juhudi Kilimo to shorten 
loan processing time (because there would be no need for in-person credit assessment 
of home/business) and potentially reach lower-income rural segments. Although EFL ’s tool 
has proved successful in other tests, given several challenges around implementation, the 
sample generated through this pilot did not have a predictive value. It was difficult to test 
the tool because it was embedded into Juhudi Kilimo’s pre-existing process, which was 
designed for productive group loans, not individual consumption. 
Digital financial services that address basic needs can be a great onboarding ramp for 
other financial products. Many PAYGo companies, for instance, have found that a solar 
loan is a customer’s first experience with a formal financial service (Sotiriou 2017). PAYGo 
companies are beginning to offer other products to customers who have repaid their solar 
loan. What began as customers’ desire for energy access has the potential to lead to 
financial access. Other products can work in the same way: If the value proposition and 
initial product meet customers’ basic needs, they are likely to use other financial products 
that address their other needs. 
CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR SUCCESS
1. Portfolio management.  Since the risk profile of these loans is very specific and is 
likely different than traditional lending, providers should consider isolating this loan 
portfolio to effectively track performance and manage lending parameters. Because 
loans are often tied to specific needs in specific sectors, isolating the loan portfolio 
could help attract impact investors who may consider financing these portfolios 
because they suit their investment profile.
2. Debt financing . These models require investors who are willing to offer debt finance 
to these companies to enable them to expand their portfolios. The companies’ ability to 
attract and manage this debt is therefore crucial. 
3. Deep contextual knowledge and customer insights . Perhaps more than in 
other cases, this model requires a deep understanding of the value proposition and 
customer context so that the financial service can be tailored to fulfill the need, facilitate 
repayment, and reduce financial risk. 
4. Integration with digital payments. These loans involve  recurrent small payments, 
which can be expensive to manage unless there is significant investment in physical 27
FOCUS NOTE   |  May 2019
infrastructure. Therefore, most of these services rely on digital payments. A close 
integration with payments providers would allow a better customer experience, which 
would make it easier and compelling for customers to submit their payments via 
mobile money.
5. Partnership with service providers. Most of these companies provide bundled 
services with the loan, which involves setting up partnerships with schools, clinics, 
input sellers, or other FSPs. These partnerships need to be strong, and the companies’ 
operations need to be well-synced, for seamless service delivery.

FINTECHS AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION   |   Fintechs as Catalysts for Financial InclusionFINTECHS AS CATALYSTS 
FOR  FINANCIAL INCLUSION
SEVERAL CHALLENGES AROSE DURING THE 18 PILOTS IN THIS STUDY.  
Some related to a company’s strategies and internal processes and others related 
to a fintech’s external environment such as funding sources, regulatory rules, etc. 
Some challenges were innovation-specific, but most were common across all 
the pilots. We sorted the challenges into two broad groups: internal and external. 
Companies can overcome internal challenges, but s olving external challenges  may involve 
several actors in the fintech’s ecosystem. 
Internal challenges 
An innovative idea is only the first step on a company’s path to product development. 
The real challenge often begins when a new fintech starts to assemble the right team, 
partnerships, and technology to bring a service to market. All fintechs need to do the 
following, particularly during early-stage innovation: 
• Develop a clear value proposition
• Assemble the right human and technological resources
• Balance digital and in-person interaction
• Form strategic partnerships
DEVELOP A CLEAR VALUE PROPOSITION
To perfect the value proposition for its customers, companies need to experiment with the 
product and develop the right product-market fit . Fintechs often do not invest enough time 
and other resources to test and articulate their value proposition before launching services. 
They may feel pressured to accommodate preferences of investors. Sometimes the emphasis 
on the technology overshadows the needs of customers. 
Several companies have attempted to digitize savings groups around the world, but Bernie 
Akporiaye, founder of MaTontine, believes most of them fail because they focus on creating 
remote digital savings groups. Although remote groups may be convenient, they do not 
deliver on a core customer value: saving-group members derive great sociocultural value in 
meeting face to face. Even large groups of 120 members form subgroups and meet in their 
neighborhoods. A digital product must reflect a fintech’s understanding of what customers 
value. Even though digital payments do make things more convenient, MaTontine SECTION 229
FOCUS NOTE   |  May 2019
encourages face-to-face meetings. For a small commission, a few community members 
from within tontine groups represent MaTontine physically. Community members help solve 
complaints, train members in the beginning, and tell them about new product offers. 
George Bakka, CEO of Patasente, an online platform for 
microbusinesses, offers three value propositions on his merchant 
platform. He must simultaneously satisfy suppliers  seeking 
receivables finance, buye rs seeking digitized invoices and 
payments, and investors  looking to make money. His research 
has primarily focused on matching customer needs to a business 
model. On the one hand, he must keep invoice-based loans 
cheap for his supplier customers, who are largely low-income 
businessmen; on the other hand, he must keep these packaged 
investments attractive for investors who believe they deserve 
higher returns for riskier loans. 
Even if a company understands its customers, testing a product 
prototype could often reveal errors or assumptions in logistics 
and delivery models that must be improved. For example, one of 
the fintechs in our study faced delays and added costs because of incorrect assumptions 
about logistic requirements of delivering services to its customers. Although the team 
had extensive skills in finance and IT, it lacked crucial insights in the context of the rural 
customers it was trying to serve. Lean product or prototype design and testing helps to 
correct errors at the prototype stage, rather than during market roll-out (Grasser 2017). 
The PPT pilot in Ghana looked into the effect of different types of nudges on deposit 
frequency and amounts into customer pension accounts. PPT wanted to test three types 
of interventions, ranging from SMS reminders to direct deposit requests. However, since 
not all PPT agents were trained in the principles of behavioral research, some distortions 
occurred. There were some spillover effects where customers in different treatment groups 
were near each other. In a few cases, agents had made subjective decisions on how to 
deliver a treatment. 
Juntos designs a new set of interactions that are tailored for each new financial institution. 
With each financial institution, it programs a short qualitative research stint that is followed 
by many sets of interactions, each of which is tested on customers, before a final one is 
rolled out to all customers. (See Box 1 for more about A/B testing, which is commonly used 
by fintechs.)
ASSEMBLE THE RIGHT HUMAN AND TECHNOLOGICAL RESOURCES
A successful company is likely to be led by a strong and inspiring management team and a 
talented workforce. In the 21st century, this must be combined with technology, insight, and 
continuous innovation. Fintechs need to think carefully about their human and technological 
capital because it can translate into a valuable competitive advantage. This may be 
challenging because having all three core skills and resources—technical, contextual, and 
leadership—can be hard to come by for start-ups in emerging markets. 
Several incubator and accelerator organizations that support fintechs play a role in sourcing 
and training human capital. The skills required to run a successful fintech start-up are not 
surprising or unique—the right combination of leadership, market context, and technical 
and technological capabilities can distinguish a company in any sector. But often, fintechs 
do not focus on this aspect early enough, and they may fail as a result (see Box 2). Even if a company 
understands its 
customers, testing 
a product prototype 
could often reveal 
errors or assumptions 
in logistics and deliv -
ery models that must 
be improved.30
FINTECHS AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION   |   Fintechs as Catalysts for Financial InclusionBALANCE DIGITAL AND IN-PERSON INTERACTION
Fintechs that serve higher-income customers in developed markets like the United States, 
Europe, and increasingly India, Brazil, the Philippines, and China offer a fully virtual 
experience in which customers register for a service with a click of a button and conduct 
their entire relationship with the provider virtually. Many customers in these markets trust 
digital financial services, making this “low-touch” approach to customer relations possible. 
Conversely, with underserved customers, particularly those in developing markets, fintechs 
first need to help consumers become comfortable with unfamiliar services and technologies. 
At the same time, a business model that relies heavily on physical interactions through 
storefronts or agents may have a limited ability to scale. Every fintech must find its own 
balance between digital and in-person interaction, and this balance will need to evolve as 
customers become comfortable with digital services and as the company needs to scale. Start-ups frequently use A/B testing to choose one element over another and assess its effectiveness. 
Busara Center for Behavioral Economics advises start-ups to use A/B testing for deciding which (1) 
product features (incentive schemes, product design), (2) processes (sign-up processes, customer 
experience), (3) communications and customer engagement (SMS, emails, physical mail), and (4) 
marketing materials (website display, message framing) to use.
• Do ensure that the testing rigor matches the level of impact expected. Setting up rigorous tests 
for small effects on small samples likely won’t give you valuable results for the expenses incurred. 
• Do use testing to validate that data systems are functioning, dynamic, and reactive. Testing should be 
viewed not only to learn new things but also to ensure you can detect and monitor changes.
• Don’t  assume testing will solve all your problems. A broken product likely needs more than just 
some tweaks and nudges. 
• Do quantify and evaluate effects, even if small. Small, piecemeal changes are what drive bigger 
systematic progress, and it is critical to understand the value of each test. 
• Don’t  test everything at once. Even if you have a huge sample to deal with, interventions require 
time, energy, and patience, and it is better to focus on three to four interventions at a time, get 
feedback, and spin off another set.
• Do make sure to have a clear plan for evaluating tests. Without having some plan for how to 
evaluate the effectiveness of interventions with some data, the test could be wasted.
• Do set up tests to run one after another. Getting a test running takes time, but the investment can 
be worthwhile if another test is run immediately after.

FOCUS NOTE   |  May 2019
Using basic technologies for low-tech segments
Smartphone penetration in many parts of Africa is low, and most low-income customers still 
use basic phones. Fintechs need to create products and services that can work on SMS and 
USSD technologies if they want to reach a large part of the low-income segment.15 
MaTontine created a web version of its product, but quickly realized that its virtual savings group 
had to be accessible through USSD menus until more of its customers used smartphones. It 
now uses SMS to remind all savings group members (sometimes as many as 120 in a group) 
to make regular payments, identify members in default, and reward lump sum winners every 
month (see Figure 5). Customers make payments using mobile money, and they track their 
eligibility for additional loans and insurance by SMS or by dialing a call center. 
Sometimes app-based solutions are created not for the end user, but for the company’s 
field agents who use smartphones for a specific purpose in the business—e.g., to enroll 
and register customers in-person. In Kenya, Tulaa agents need to capture and sync 
detailed information to their databases for credit checks. Tulaa Product Manager Alex 
Royea points out that it is important for Tulaa’s customers, who may have never bought 
inputs remotely, to be able to see their inputs on a screen. USSD menus don’t have these 
capabilities, so Tulaa agents use a tablet or smartphone app for customer registration, input 
15 Three fintechs in the study—Fundu, Wave, and NALA—that focus on customers in India, Myanmar, and 
Tanzania exclusively use smartphone apps. The heavy focus on founders in the start-up world is not entirely unwarranted. A good leader can 
pitch an idea with passion, attract funding, and drive the company’s vision. In our pilots, we met 
several such leaders. They were especially effective when they had a clear understanding of their 
value proposition with their customers and when they could use this to inspire their staff. 
Nonetheless, while founders often have great ideas or deep knowledge about a sector, they may not 
have the financial and business skills to take an idea and build a business around it. The ability to 
pull together a credible business plan, be aware of assumptions, and find strategic investors are all 
critical skills a start-up needs. Some organizations that work with early-stage start-ups (e.g., Village 
Capital, LHOFT Luxembourg, among others) focus on creating these capabilities in the founding 
teams at an early stage.

FINTECHS AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION   |   Fintechs as Catalysts for Financial Inclusionselection, and loan application. Customers use their basic phones to make USSD-based 
payments and to interact with Tulaa via SMS.
Others, like NALA, which offers a smartphone app, include simple onboarding screens and 
instructional videos to help customers register. The app’s Mama NALA feature facilitates 
customer support via WhatsApp to provide one-on-one guidance for the many customers 
who struggle to onboard by themselves. See Figure 6.
Nudging customers toward the digital experience 
In areas where digital payments often fail or lead to fraud, fintechs may need a high-touch 
approach during acquisition and strategies to slowly ramp up digital interactions as 
customers become comfortable with the digital experience. For example, when Social 
Lender moved from its smartphone-based product to an SMS product to reach lower 
income customers, it realized it needed to change its marketing strategy as well. It hired 
agents to explain the product in-person at local markets and other busy areas. It also used 
a referral reward system to turn early customers into ambassadors who could explain the 
product to other potential customers in their communities. 
Beyond customer acquisition, face-to-face engagement is also important when training 
customers on how to use a complex solution. Bernie Akporiaye, who started MaTontine, 
says this kind of engagement is as necessary when finance is linked with strong communal 
ties and relationships as it is in savings groups and associations. Financial decisions are 
often done in the context of a group. “If the group doesn’t trust you, the solution doesn’t 
work,” he says.
Even in cases where customers receive money, as with Social Lender’s mobile loan in Nigeria, 
there can be skepticism. Customers in Nigeria are used to being asked for collateral, so FIGURE 5.  MaTontine SMS screens and USSD menus

when Social Lender offered a loan based solely on “social” collateral (references provided 
by the borrower) instead of physical collateral, many thought it was a scam. This was one of 
the reasons why Social Lender decided to include in-person touch points to its onboarding 
strategy and leverage early customers who could vouch for the validity of the product.
Getting to the right balance may also depend on the nature of the product, especially for 
complex services, such as pension, insurance, etc., that are being offered digitally. Apollo, 
which bundled insurance with its loan product to protect customers and its portfolio from 
weather conditions, found that customers had difficulty understanding its complex product 
in a digital setting. Almost half of Apollo’s clients had never received a loan and less than 
half had used insurance, so they had little or no experience with this type of bundling. 
PPT, which offers pensions in Ghana, knows it cannot avoid physical interaction during 
onboarding. Yet its business model relies on being digital to break even. At the outset, 
PPT works with cocoa associations and large savings groups to acquire customers when 
they are in large group environments they trust. Acquiring customers in mass also keeps 
operation costs down. PPT CEO Samuel Waterberg says building trust in-person during 
onboarding is crucial:
“Imagine being asked to save your hard-earned money digitally with a pensions 
company you don’t know and all year, you’ve heard of mobile payments frauds. You 
will get this money when you are 60, and you are told it’s not entirely certain how 
much you will get. Why would you save? We need to build a value proposition that is 
based on some transparency and flexibility of taking money in and out. Without the 
right incentives, we would be at a dead-end.”
Waterberg had been observing his operations and had sought constant feedback from his 
operations team. This, and what he learned from the pilot, gave him some indication of his FIGURE 6.  NALA onboarding screens

board meeting in May 2018, a “high touch-low touch” segmentation strategy was adopted. 
To keep costs in check and still do right by customer needs, PPT divided its customer 
base into three segments with different operational costs and considerations (see Table 3). 
PPT might even experiment with different pricing. In each of the two high-touch customer 
segments, agents would have targets to nudge customers toward digital payments.

Despite its name, fintechs need not always be hi-tech. Companies must be able to 
articulate how technology is key in serving poor customers, but also what its limits are. 
Many feel the pressure (or see the benefits) to pitch themselves as a technology company 
because they want to (i) follow the general “craze” (and are quick to use buzz words like 
artificial intelligence and machine learning) and (ii) make themselves more attractive to 
funders. In some instances, fintechs claim to have a technology 
that they do not have. In others, they do have the technology, 
but it does not actually play a key role in their product or service. 
Ultimately the right technology is simply what is necessary to 
serve customers and sustainably scale. Ultimately the right

FOCUS NOTE   |  May 2019
FORM STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS
Many early-stage fintechs need partnerships to get their ideas off the ground, either because 
they do not have scale or capabilities or because getting adequate licensing does not make 
sense until after they have proven their business.16 But because they are new and small, it 
can be difficult for them to forge equitable partnerships with more established institutions. 
Partnerships are often forged with incumbent FSPs, but they 
could also be with nongovernment organizations (NGOs), 
technology firms, and other institutions. Partnerships must 
be mutually beneficial—fintechs can leverage the existing 
infrastructure and brand of an established institution to deliver 
services or build a customer base, while FSPs can look to 
fintechs to bring innovation and diversity to their portfolios or 
access to new markets or customer segments. Establishing and 
managing early partnerships with FSPs and NGOs was key to the 
success of many fintechs in the study. 
Types of partnerships
Early-stage fintechs often partner with relatively small MFIs because these MFIs are more 
accessible than traditional banks. However, MFIs tend to lack robust IT systems and often 
rely on manual and paper-based applications. On the other hand, if fintechs partner with 
large incumbent FSPs like national banks or large MNOs, they often have the weaker of the 
two bargaining positions and find it hard to achieve their business goals. Large FSPs can 
be unwilling to dedicate the time and resources to establish customized operations (such 
as menus or screens) when the revenue stream from the fintech is small. 
Open APIs can play a big role in helping fintechs leverage various strengths and assets of 
more established players and prove their value proposition without a strain on either party.17 
By integrating their systems, information can flow seamlessly between platforms, so that 
clients can take advantage of the services of both partners. A key caveat is that the cost 
for linking APIs should be affordable for start-ups. Open APIs are not widely available in 
emerging markets, and fintechs will need ad-hoc integrations with partners.18 
Fintechs may also rely on farmers’ associations, savings groups, and other social 
organizations to sign up and manage relationships with large groups of new clients. These 
partners can help explain new financial services to a big group of new clients, thereby 
bringing down costs of face-to-face interactions. Working through these associations also 
helps fintechs to develop the trust of members. For example, Patasente, an online supply 
chain financing platform for small businesses, is working with a dairy cooperative in Uganda 
to help convene farmers for registration sessions and to collect data on milk supplies. The 
data on milk supplies increase the chance of farmers receiving a loan from the Patasente 
platform. The cooperative shares some of the costs in the hope that its farmers will receive a 
package of services that is more valuable than what they usually get from other cooperatives. 
16 Here we are not referring to business-to-business fintechs that act as vendors to FSPs, but to compa-
nies that partner with each other in a way that distributes risk between them. 
17 See “Open API Strategies: How to Plan for Success,” CGAP , https://www.cgap.org/topics/collections/
open-apis.
18 To address this gap, the Dutch Development Bank has launched Finforward in Africa to accelerate and 
reduce the cost of integration between financial institutions, mobile money providers, and fintechs (see 
https://www.finforward.tech/).Establishing and 
managing early part -
nerships with FSPs 
and NGOs was key to 
the success of many 
fintechs in the study.36

that it may not always be able to control, such as delays and lack of response, but it may 
still be the one to lose credibility with the customer. 
For example, Eko connects to the Indian UPI infrastructure and banking system through 
its app. There are often standard screens from the banks or from UPI that must be 
incorporated into the Eko app even though these screens may not be as user friendly as 
Eko’s own screens and may cause customers to drop off. See Table 4 for a brief look at 
Eko partnerships and those of other fintechs.
Unlike PPT, which partners with Vodaphone and has a unique short code for its customers, 
Patasente does not have a direct relationship with a mobile provider in Uganda; it works 
through a mobile-payments aggregator. Its short code is not easy to remember, which can 
be a problem for customers. 
Negotiating the right kinds of partnerships is crucial for fintechs. In cases where fintechs 
can convince FSPs of their value proposition, they can negotiate stronger positions for 
themselves in the partnership, including on factors such as data ownership and appropriate 
TABLE 4.  Sample partnerships across selection of fintechs
Fintech Partners Partnership Type
Tulaa—provides 
smallholder customers 
financing for inputs Input distributors and retailers and 
MFIs or any FSP authorized to 
provide credit. Tulaa intermediated 
between all. Heavy dependence—delays in approving loans 
or getting inputs ready jeopardized Tulaa’s credibili-
ty with the customer, which led the company to 
start its own lending.
Biolite—provides 
clean energy products 
(cookstoves, solar light 
systems)MFI that finances the purchase. Heavy dependence—delays in approving loans 
or rejecting potential customers directly impact 
Biolite’s ability to sell.
Eko Fundu—provides 
person-to-person cash 
exchange using app Banks. Eko cannot accept deposits, 
so it relies on the Indian UPI and 
connects to the banking infrastruc-
ture to withdraw and deposit funds 
into users’ bank accounts. It has a 
partnership with two banks that may 
hold deposits. Moderate dependence—the Indian UPI infra-
structure is largely independent and open, but 
apps still need to be approved after a long audit. 
It is at the individual banks’ discretion to offer cus-
tomized screens that are included on the Eko app. 
Farmdrive—offers digital 
loans to smallholder 
farmersPayments aggregator to process 
loan disbursements and repay-
ments.Moderate dependence—although the payments 
aggregation did not seem like a central strategic 
part of the business (there are multiple providers 
available), there were significant delays in the 
Farmdrive pilot because its payments aggregator 
went out of business, leaving FarmDrive without a 
way to recover or disburse loans while it set up the 
integration directly with the MNO. 
Patasente—provides 
online marketplace 
linking small investors 
to invoice factoring for 
microentrepreneursPayments aggregator. Low dependence—Patasente is licensed to lend 
and offer investment products directly. But it is a 
very young company, with a very small customer 
base. To scale, it would need partnerships with big 
FSPs and MNOs.37

access to customers. Tulaa in Kenya articulated key aspects of a partnership agreement 
with FSPs. Through its pilot, it learned that if it could not directly offer loans, contracts with 
FSP partners will need to include the following:19
• Complete system integration through an API. 
• Mandatory training of FSP staff, including those in branches, before launch. 
• Aligning incentives for branch staff and loan officers with the partnership objectives. 
• Clearly defined project governance structures.
External challenges 
Fintechs are also vulnerable to their external environment and require industry-level efforts 
from a broader set of stakeholders. Because most fintechs are small and often have limited 
influence in their early days, they are not likely to overcome these challenges on their own. A 
single fintech may not be able to convince a large African bank to open its APIs. Or, a single 
fintech may not be able to convince impact investors or development finance institutions to 
invest in early-stage start-ups. The pilots demonstrated three kinds of market-level, external 
challenges that inhibit the impact fintechs can have: (i) entering a crowded marketplace of 
ideas, (ii) translating ideas into capabilities, and (iii) extracting lessons, especially from failures.
ENTERING A CROWDED MARKETPLACE OF IDEAS
Fintechs offer a variety of financial products and services, through many delivery channels, 
ranging from mobile insurance to blockchain payments. Many of their business models are 
entirely new, too. Since much of this innovation is new, there are no universal classifications 
that delineate this space. 
With too many models, and too little clarity, funders who may be used to funding banks 
and MFIs with traditional business models in emerging markets don’t easily engage 
with fintechs. Funding for fintech is focused on familiar models, such as payments or 
traditional credit; frontier innovation tends to receive less funding. Partnerships between 
large banks and fintechs are ad-hoc, and in the absence of open APIs, only the influential 
fintechs break through. 
Without clear frameworks, regulators find it challenging to keep up with new models. This 
can have an effect at two extremes—it may impede innovation when regulations are too 
rigid or it may put customers at risk if regulations are too open. 
Translating ideas to capability
In a crowded space with many ideas, there are few metrics for success. Despite having 
a good idea, it is difficult to assess the operational performance of early-stage fintechs. 
Funders and established financial institutions that wish to partner with fintechs find it difficult 
to assess whether a start-up has adequate skills, knowledge, and execution capabilities 
to bring its idea to market successfully. We need greater clarity on how an idea translates 
into strong business models that can scale and impact financial inclusion to draw in key 
stakeholders (see Figure 7).
19 In the end, these conditions were very difficult to meet, which is why Tulaa opted to start lending from its 
balance sheet. Hillary Miller-Wise, Tulaa’s CEO, noted that, while this decision certainly increases financial 
risk for the company, it enables Tulaa to control the customer experience and ultimately the company’s 
reputation in the market. 38
FINTECHS AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION   |   Fintechs as Catalysts for Financial InclusionWithout metrics to assess a firm’s capabilities and risks, regulators will struggle to regulate 
and supervise new kinds of services. A regulatory sandbox—a space for testing innovative 
ideas in a live environment with time-bound permission—may be a viable solution (Jenik 
2017). Sandboxes allow regulators to test solutions, monitor risk, and assess impact before 
providing a full license. Regulatory sandboxes are growing in popularity, although mostly 
in developed financial markets. However, they are being considered in India, Malaysia, and 
other EMDE markets. (See Figure 8.) They have the potential to break down some barriers 
on innovation and experiences. They can gather lessons within a safe testing environment, 
without risks to consumers or the market. 
EXTRACTING LESSONS, ESPECIALLY FROM FAILURES
Global, detailed lessons about the progress fintech companies make in solving pain points 
in our sector would give the industry a realistic sense of their effects on financial inclusion. 
Lessons on success could crowd-in other innovators and incumbents.  Even lessons from 
failures may result in valuable learning for the market. New start-ups would benefit from 
lessons learned from other fintechs. However, such lessons are scarce. FIGURE 7.  Fintech and the “Valley of Death”Net cash flow

FOCUS NOTE   |  May 2019
A 2010 CGAP grant project tested a promising new digital credit product called Jipange 
Kusave (JKS) designed by start-up Mobile Ventures Kenya. The product launched 
successfully, but failed because of partnership dynamics and regulatory restrictions, and 
it shut down. In the process, lessons from this effort seeded ideas in the market that 
eventually contributed to Safaricom and CBA launching the very successful MShwari digital 
credit product. JKS’ failure affected its early investors but for the sector at large, it exposed 
a massive customer need and a market opportunity that incumbents had missed (Breloff 
and Gonzalez 2013). 
Each of these challenges, if not resolved, may curtail the overall impact of fintech innovation. 
In some mature fintech markets, like Latin America, fintech associations that represent the 
industry are springing up and have effectively clarified issues and created linkages. Where 
these associations don’t exist, there is a need for better connections between fintech and 
the broader ecosystem of funders, regulators, and established financial institutions. FIGURE 8.  Regulatory sandboxes around the world

FINTECHS AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION   |   ConclusionCONCLUSION
After two years of experimentation, we see preliminary indications that fintechs have the 
potential to advance financial inclusion. There is a cohort of companies beginning to 
emerge that focuses on underserved segments or solutions for complex pain points in 
financial inclusion efforts. 
Whether the innovation is simple or complex, fintechs will need to mature, prove their 
business models, and demonstrate impact. The financial services ecosystem, including 
funders, regulators, and established financial institutions, will need greater clarity on 
fintech business models, so they may create stronger connections, more effectively help 
underserved customers, and achieve financial inclusion goals. 
Going forward, CGAP will support the global development sector, policy makers, and the 
impact investing industry by facilitating a common understanding of emerging business 
models in fintech and their potential to advance financial inclusion. We will also work to 
extract lessons from fintech innovations that can help inform industry about what creates 
value for the poor and what the limitations of new approaches are.41
