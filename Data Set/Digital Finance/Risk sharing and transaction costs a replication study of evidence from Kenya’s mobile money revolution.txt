 About 3ie  
The International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie) is an international grant -making 
NGO promoting evidence- informed development policies and programs. We are the 
global leader in funding, producing and synthesi sing high -quality evidence of what works,  
for whom, how, why and at what cost. We believe that using better and policy -relevant  
evidence helps to make development more effective and improve people’s lives.  
3ie Replication Paper Series  
The 3ie Replication Paper Series is designed to be a publication and dissemination 
outlet for internal replication studies of developme nt impact evaluations. Internal 
replication studies are those that reanaly se the data from an original paper in order to  
validate the results. The series seeks to publish r eplication studies with findings that  
reinforce or challenge the results of an original paper. To be eligible for submission, a  
replication study needs to be of a paper in 3ie’s online Impact Evaluation Repository and 
needs to include a pure replication. 3ie invites formal replies from the original authors.  
These are published on the 3ie website toget her with the replication study.  
The 3ie Replication Program also includes grant -making windows to fund replication 
studies of papers identified on our candida te studies list. Requests for proposals are  
issued one to two times a year. The candidate studies list includes published studies that  
are considered influential, innovative or counterintuitive. The list is periodically updated 
based on 3ie staff input and outside suggestions. The aim of the 3ie Replication Program  
is to improve the quality of evidence from development impact evaluations for use in 
policymaking and program design .

i Acknowledgements 
First, I would like to thank the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie) and the 
Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation f or providing me with the support to conduct this 
replication study.  I wish to extent my great appreciation to 3ie’s team for Replication 
Window 4 (Financial Services for the Poor) –  Benjamin DK Wood, Eric Djimeu and Scott 
Neilitz – who helped me by providing invaluable guidance and support throughout the 
study. I also thank the internal and external reviewers and advisors and the selection 
panel for their constructive comments on the proposal and the final report. Finally, I am 
grateful to the original authors, professors William Jack and Tavneet Suri, who provided me with their code and data and were helpful in answering my questions.  
 ii Summary  
M-PESA, a mobile phone– based technology for transferring money, provides a gateway 
to formal financial services for populations who otherwise would not have access to 
those services. In a 2014 study, William Jack and Tavneet Suri  analyse a panel of 2,282 
Kenyan households over the 2008– 2010 period to estimate how M -PESA has enabled 
financial risk sharing.  They  focus on two types of negative shocks  – an overall negative 
shock and an illness shock –  and then analyse how family members and fr iends share 
financial resources during these adverse events. A key finding is that M -PESA users, 
relative to nonusers, are largely able to protect their consumption when faced with 
negative income shocks. They are more likely to receive remittances in the face of 
unexpected negative shocks, receiving both a greater number and higher value of remittances. They also receive remittances over greater distances and from wider networks.  
This replication study uses pure replication, robustness checks and additional model 
specifications to re-examine this recent work on the impact of transaction costs on the 
ability of households to share risk using a mobile money innovation, M -PESA.  
I conduct  the twin strategies of push -button replication and pure replication. For the 
push- button replication,  I use the code provided by the original authors . For the pure 
replication,  I use an independent coding method. With only a few minor differences, 
push- button and pure replication results both support the original authors’ findi ngs. I also 
find that the results are robust to various consistency and robustness checks , such as 
propensity score matching and Tobit model specification.  
Finally, I explore heterogeneous effects by comparing benefits across urban and rural 
residents. The latter are expected to particularly benefit from M -PESA, as they are more 
likely to be excluded from formal financial services. However, I  cannot confirm the effect 
is more pronounced in urban versus rural segment s. 
Jack and Suri’s  original findings and my  replication provide strong empirical evidence 
that M -PESA has had a positive impact on people’s financial health. The financial 
benefits derived from market -based mobile money innovations can play a vital  role in 
combating world poverty. Policymakers should take one crucial step : adopt enabling 
policies that allow competing firms to offer new technologies such as M -PESA.

 1 1. Introduction  
Mobile money, a f inancial inclusion instrument, has had a revolutionary impact on the 
lives of the poor, who previously had limited (if any)  access to formal financial services.  
This recent innovation has expanded the reach of financial services beyond the realm of 
traditi onal ‘brick  and mortar ’ banks. Mobile money , as a means to improve access to 
financial services in low - and middle- income  countries , is a key enabler  to most of the 
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals ,1 which  aim to end poverty, protect the 
planet  and ensure prosperity for all (GSMA 2017).  
A recent study by Suri and Jack (2016) found that within eight years, M -PESA lifted 
194,000 households –  2 per cent  of the Kenyan population –  out of poverty, helping 
people develop greater financial resilience and savings, especially among female-
headed households.  M-PESA also enabled 185,000 women to move out of subsistence 
farming into business or retail occupations. Thus, it contributes towards Sustainable 
Development Goal 1, eradicating poverty , and Sustainable Development Goal 5, 
achieving gender equality and economic empowerment of wom en (UNCDF 2018).  
Although  access to financial services has clearly grown in developing nations, evidence 
of its potential economic effects has been less clear . As a result , a growing body of 
recent academic research has focused on understanding the economic impact of mobile 
money as a poverty alleviation tool in developing economies (Aker and Mbiti 2010; Mbiti 
and Weil  2011; Jack and Suri 2011 ; Suri and Jack 2016;  Munyegera and Matsumoto 
2016).  
In low - and middle- income countries, high  income risk is an inevitable part of life 
(Alderman and Paxon 1992) . In addition to climate risks  and economic fluctuations, a 
large number of idiosyncratic shocks make these households vulnerabl e to sever e 
hardship. In Kenya, a large number of households are exposed to a variety of risks, 
including crop failure (as a result of drought, flood  and other climate events ), illness or 
job loss . In order to control risk and cope with these income shocks , households 
regularly make use of a variety of strategies . Given  poor access to formal insurance, 
informal networks , such as family members and friends , can play a crucial role in  sharing 
risks in the event of any negative shocks  (De Weerdt and Dercon 2006 ; Fafchamps and 
Lund 2003) .  
M-PESA,2 Kenya’s world- leading mobile phone– based service, has facilitated a range of 
financial transactions , including deposit, withdrawal and transferring capabilities. Despite 
the wide range of services offered, person -to-person transfers dominate M -PESA use , 
mainly due to the growing pace of the rural -to-urban migration,  which is accelerating 
demand for secure, fast and affordable means of sending  remittances home (Aker and 
Mbiti 2010).  
Jack and Suri (2014) explore the impact of mobile money on informal risk sharing. They use panel data to analyse how mobile money can improve the ability of households to 
                                                
1 The Sustainable Development Goals are a collection of 17 global goals to transform our world 
by the United Nations.  
2 M-PESA: M stands for mobile and pesa is Swahili for money.  2 smooth consumption in response to negative idiosyncratic shocks. They find that the 
introduction of M -PESA facilitates th e redistribution of finances across geographical 
distances . The success of M -PESA in improving households’ ability to spread risk is 
mainly attributed to a reduction in transaction costs. As a result, M -PESA has helped lift  
Kenyan households out of poverty  (Suri and Jack 2016) . 
To better understand the robustness of this promising evidence, this paper aims to 
investigate key findings Jack and Suri report in their influential American Economic 
Review  article , ‘Risk Sharing and Transaction Costs: Evidence fro m Mob ile Money 
Revolution in Kenya ’ (2014) . My replication proceeds as follows. In Section 2, I explain 
the twin replication strategies of push- button replication and pure replication. In this 
section,  I explain the data, methods  and assumptions I use to c onduct the replication 
research. In Section 3, I explore some of the alternate strategies to determine the 
robustness of the results to the analysis method. In Section 4, by changing the focus of 
analysis from the entire population (including rural and urban residents ) to the rural 
segment of the population supposedly excluded by formal financial services, I am able to 
assess whether M -PESA has abandoned its initial promise, ‘ banking for the unbanked’ . I 
then provide some limitations and conclusions at the end of the report.  
I have three main findings. First, w ith only a few minor differences,  both the push- button 
and pure replication results support  the original authors’ findings . Second, I  find that their 
results are robust to various consistency tests and robustness checks , such as 
propensity score matching and Tobit model specification. Third, I am not able to confirm 
that the effect of mobile money is more pronounced for urban than rural residents . My 
replication provides strong empirical evidence confir ming that M -PESA has had a 
positive impact on people’s financial health.  
2. Replication 
2.1 Push- button replication  
My replication study  (Alinaghi  and Reed 2017)  starts with push- button replication, in 
which  one attempts to ‘ push a button’  and reproduce the publi shed tables in the original 
study using the code provided by the authors. I downloaded the original data set and 
code available on the paper’s webpage at the American Economic Review .3 Although 
the original paper used two rounds of household survey data, t he extract available on the 
webpage did not include data from the first round. To obtain access to these data, I  
contacted the Financial Sector Deepening Trust Kenya (FSD Kenya),  as instructed by 
the authors ’ webpage. Once I received permission from FSD  Kenya, Jack and Suri  
provided the final extract used in the original paper.   
With only a few minor differences, my push- button replication was able to exactly 
reproduce the authors’ original results. A  few tables (such as part of Table 2, Table 7A 
and two tables in the Web Appendix) could not be reproduced,  since I was unable to 
obtain the associated data and code from the authors.  
                                                
3 Data and code can be found at https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.104.1.183.  3 2.2 Pure  replication  
Although a push -button replication seeks to duplicate a paper’s findings using the 
original data and code provided by the authors, pure replication attempts to reproduce 
the paper’s findings by reconstructing data and code,  following the descriptions and 
explanations supplied in the text.  
Two common methodologies for pure replication are code auditing and independent 
coding. I chose to implement the latter. To do so, I  read the description associated with 
each table and attempted to write the code to reproduce the corresponding findings. In some cases , the description provided in the paper gave insufficient detail. W hen this 
occurred, I referred to the original code to better understand the authors’ intent.  
2.2.1  The data 
Jack and Suri’s  study is based on a large panel household survey , conducted over a 
three -year period. The initial survey was conducted on 3,000 households  from August –
October 2008. Two follow -up surveys were conducted from October 2009 –January 2010 
and May –August 2010. Attrition was high. Although  the original study consisted of 3 ,000 
households, the number of households interviewed for the second and third rounds fell to 
2,105 and 1,531 . Notably,  265 households missing from the second round reappeared in 
the third round.  
The high attrition rate created a challenge, as only 1,266 households appeared in all 
three rounds of the survey. As a result, the author s decided to compress the panel into 
two rounds, taking the households included in the first and second rounds  and adding to 
them the 265 households that appeared in the first and third  rounds,  but not the second 
round. This allowed a balanced, two-period panel with a potential maximum of 2,370 
households, or 4,740 observations.  
The actual extract provided by the original authors  consisted of 5,281 observations, with 
2,999 observations from the first survey, 2,017 from the second and 265 from the third. 
The last two rounds were combined  and households not available in the second period 
were dropped from the first round, resulting in a balanced, two-period panel extract of 
2,282 households.  
2.2.2  Brief description of observational study  
Jack and Suri  motivate their  study using a theoretical framework to demonstrate how 
transaction costs can play a significant role in risk sharing. To empirically study how M -
PESA affected risk sharing, they use a difference -in-difference analysis to compare 
changes in consumption bet ween M -PESA users and nonusers in response to negative 
income shocks. They estimate the following specification:  
𝐶𝐶
𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖+ 𝛾𝛾𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜇𝜇𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝛽𝛽𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖×𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜃𝜃𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜋𝜋𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖+𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖, (1) 
where 𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is annual per capita consumption for household 𝑖𝑖  in location 𝑗𝑗 in period 𝑡𝑡, 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 is 
a household fixed effect, 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a dummy variable equal to 1  if the household 
reported experiencing a negative shock, 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a dummy taking the value of 1 if the 
household was an M -PESA user, 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a vector of contr ols and 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 and 𝜋𝜋𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖 are location-
by-time and rural -by-time dummy variables.  4 Since remittances is the hypothesi sed channel by which households can smooth 
consumption, Jack and Suri  estimate another version of the above estimation:  
𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖+ 𝛾𝛾𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜇𝜇𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝛽𝛽𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖×𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜃𝜃𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜋𝜋𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖+𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , (2) 
where 𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a measure of remittances over the previous six  months.  
To further control for any observable c haracteristics that could affect the ability of 
households to smooth consumption, Jack and Suri  provide a specification in which the 
interaction of the negative shocks with all observable covariates have been included:  
𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖+ 𝛾𝛾𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜇𝜇𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝛽𝛽𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖×𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜃𝜃𝑆𝑆𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖×𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜃𝜃𝑀𝑀𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+
 𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜋𝜋𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖+𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (3) 
As a further robustness check, Jack and Suri  use agent rollout data to estimate the 
following spec ification:  
𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖=𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖+ 𝛾𝛾𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜗𝜗𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑈𝑈𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑈𝑈𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖×𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜃𝜃𝑀𝑀𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜋𝜋𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖+𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,   (4)  
where 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑈𝑈𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a measure of access to an M -PESA agent.  
2.2.3  Replicated results 
I re-estimated the results in Jack and Suri’s  Tables 1– 9. Additionally, I  reproduced their 
Tables 1– 3, which appear in their Online Appendix. A further two tables were published 
in a web appendix ; however, I  was unable to reproduce these due to a lac k of data. My  
replication results are comparable with the original findings. Technically , however, my 
results must be categorized as incomplete,  as I was unable to replicate all the tables due 
to missing data. Each of the reproduced outcomes is  discussed b elow.  
Table 1A –1C: summary statistics  
I begin my pure replication by reproducing summary statistics for the full sample reported 
in the first table of the original paper. Appendix  Table A14 compares variables over the 
first two rounds of the survey (2008 and 2009). My  findings are identical to those 
reported in Table 1A  in the original paper . However, a notable omission from Table 1 
reported in the original paper is the age of the household head. If wealth correlates with 
the age of the household head, whi ch is plausible, more strategic remittances would be 
expected.  
Table 1B in the original study provides additional information on remittances over the two 
survey rounds.5 Appendix Table A2 reports the results obtained when I use my code,  
following Jack and Suri’s  descriptions in the text. The grey -highlighted section indicates a 
difference in the values produced by my code and the values reported in their paper. 
                                                
4 The results corresponding to pure replication are reported in Appendix Table A1– Table A25.  
5 Although Jack and Suri provide some detail on the nature of remittances in the Table 1B, further 
information, such as the recipients of remittances (to whom the remittances were sent), would 
have been helpful. This information is available in the raw data sets. The problem is taking these 
data and matching them to the extracts used for the American Economic Review  analysis. It was 
not possible to do this without further assistance from the original authors. Other information, such 
as the timing of remittances relative to the timing of the shocks, was not availabl e in the raw data.  5 Upon inspection of the code, I realized the discrepancy arose because the authors’  code 
converted zeroes to missing values for the first five variables. Although I am not sure 
whether they cleaned the data at this stage, once I  adjust my code accordingly, I  
reproduce Table 1B exactly ( Appendix  Table A3).  
Table 1C in the original study is based on an extract taken from the first survey round. 
This table compares transaction costs for various types of transfers. I was able to exactly 
replicate this table (Appendix  Table A4). I note that other than hand delivery and bus 
delivery by a friend or relative, the lowest transaction costs are associated with M -PESA.  
Table 2: agents’  characteristics  
In addition to surveying households, Jack and Suri  also report information about access 
to M-PESA agents. These results are reported in Table 2 of the original paper . The 
associated replication is reported in t he Appendix  Table A5. I was able to exactly 
replicate Panel s A and C of Table 2 in the original paper . However, I  was unable to 
reproduce Panels B (agent distribution) , because I could not obtain these data from  the 
authors .6 
Table 3: correlation of shock measures  
Table 3 in the original paper  summarizes correlations between the two shock measures 
(overall and illness shocks) and a number of household- level variables. Appendix Table 
A6 reports my respective repli cation. Note that ‘ Agents within 1, 2 and 5 km ’ actually 
refers to the square root of the number of agents. The reason for using the square root is that the number of agents has a long right tail. The grey-highlighted cells indicate minor 
differences in the partial R
2 produced by Jack and Suri’s  code and the values reported in 
their table.  
Basic specification  
Tables 4A and 4B: basic difference -in-difference results  
Jack and Suri’s  main results are reported in Table 4 of their paper, which is based on 
estima ting equation (1) above. The main conclusion to draw from this table is that M -
PESA users are better able to smooth their consumption in the presence of negative 
shocks (the coefficient on ‘ User × negative shock ’). Appendix Table A7 presents my 
replication results. These matched exactly after I  adjusted for a discrepancy between the 
authors’  code and their description of the table.  
In the process of replicating Table 4,  I uncovered a discrepancy between their code and 
their description of Table 4. In the notes below the table, Jack and Suri  state , 
‘Heteroscedasticity  - robust standard errors in brackets ’. However, the standard errors 
reported in the first column ( ‘OLS’) are conventional ordinary least squares (OLS)  
standard errors. When I estimated robust s tandard errors consistent with the table notes, 
the variable ‘ User × negative shock ’ lost its statistical significance. The 
heteroskedasticity -robust standard error was 0.0717, with a p -value of 0.201.  
Table 4B in the original paper  checks the results of T able 4A for robustness, varying the 
sample dependent variable and control variables. I  was able to exactl y match Jack and 
                                                
6 There is a minor difference for the total number of agents (light grey –highlighted area). The dark 
grey–highlighted cells show the cases I was unable to replicate due to data unavailability.  6 Suri’s results  (Appendix  Table A8 ). According to the title of column 4 in Table 4B and the 
corresponding explanation on page 20 of the original  paper, one would be led to believe 
that the only district excluded from the sample for this column was Mombasa, the second 
largest city in Kenya. However, it turns out that the sample corresponding to column 4 
excludes both Mombasa and Nairobi. A s a result, I  re-estimated the specification of 
column 4, excluding Mombasa but keeping Nairobi. The results are reported in column 
‘4-new’ (the grey -highlighted column). The coefficient on ‘ User × negative shock ’ is 
consistent with the other robustness checks of Table 4B.  
Table 4C: results for health shocks  
Table 4C in the original paper  continues to check for robustness by exploring the impact 
of health shocks. My  replication results, based on the authors’  descriptions, are given in 
Appendix  Table A9. Although  my results are generally consistent with Table 4C, I 
obtained different estimates . No significant difference can be observed between the 
results reported in Appendix Table A9 and Table A10. Whereas  the whole sample is 
considered in the former table, Nairobi is excluded from the latter.  Closer investigation 
uncovered that the results in the source table excluded Nairobi. However, this was not  
mentioned in the text. When I  excluded Nairobi, I  obtained results identical to Table 4C in 
the original paper (Appendix  Table A10).  
Mechanisms  
Table 5A: mechanisms  
One of the main channels by which households share risks is through remittances. 
Whereas equation (1) focuses on consumption outcomes, equation (2) tests whether 
remittances respond to negative shocks i n the manner predicted by the theory. Table 5A 
in the original paper  reports the results from estimating equation (2), and my replication 
results are reported in Appendix  Table A11.  
The results reported in the first two columns show the likelihood of recei ving remittances. 
The third column represents the frequency of remittances. In column 4, the dependent variable is total remittances received by households. To account for the extreme positive 
skewness of total remittances, Jack and Suri  worked with its sq uare root. In addition, 
they excluded outliers from their sample.
7 Results from excluding Mombasa from the 
sample are reported in columns 5 and 6. The last two columns focus on illness shocks. I  
was able to exactly reproduce their results.  
The estimates reported in Appendix  Table A11 confirm that M -PESA users are more 
likely to receive remittances in the event of a negative shock. All of the ‘ User × shock ’ 
coefficients have the expected (positive) sign and all are significant to at least the 10 per 
cent significance level.  
Appendix Table A12 in the original paper  reports estimates of the impact of M -PESA on 
the size and number of networks households have access  to in the event of negative 
shocks. Three measures of remittance networks are used: (i) the average distance 
remittances travelled to reach the target household,  (ii) the number of different 
                                                
7 According to Jack and Suri’s code, outliers are defined as those who receive more than 42,000 
Kenyan shillings.  7 relatives/friends from whom remittances were received and (iii) the fraction of networks 
remitting. Again, I was able to exactly replicate the original  results.  
Results using agent  data 
To control for potential endogeneity associated with being an M -PESA user, Jack and 
Suri used agent rollout data, replacing user with agent in the estimated specifications 
(see equation ( 4)). The corresponding results are reported i n their Tables 6A and 6B. My  
replication results are reported in Appendix  Table A13 and Table A14.  
The key variable in these tables is the agent variable. It generally measures the number 
of agents within a certain distance of the household (1 kilometer, 2 kilometer , 5 kilometer  
and 20 kilometer ). In columns 5 and 6 of Appendix  Table A14, the agent variable is 
measured by the log of distance of the closest agent, where distance is measured in 
meters. The ‘Agents × shock ’ coefficient always has the expected sign and is generally 
significant. I was able to exactly reproduce the original  results in b oth tables.  
Appendix  Table A 15 reports the correlation between agent rollout and household- level 
observables. The exogeneity of the agent variable is supported by the general lack of 
significant correlations between the presence of nearby agents and household variables. 
The grey-highlighted cells indicate cases in which the replicated results differ from the 
original estimat es. The discrepancies do not affect any of the qualitative conclusions 
from this table.  
Falsification test 
To further examine whether there is a systematic relationship between the rollout of M -
PESA agents and household characteristics, Jack and Suri  performed a falsification test 
using data prior to the introduction of M -PESA (1997– 2007) . As they explain in the 
paper, they make use of an entirely rural survey , in which the total consumption data had 
not been collected. As a result, they change the focus of  analysis from total consumption 
to a limited number of items in consumption,  including maize consumption and some 
other components of food consumption.  The results are reported in Table 7A  in the 
original paper . Unfortunately, I  was unable to obtain these data from the authors and,  
therefore , was unable to confirm their estimates ( Appendix  Table A16).8 
Table 7B in the original paper  tailors the post -M-PESA sample to match the pre -M-PESA 
sample used in the falsification test of Table 7A. My replication of t hese results are 
reported in Appendix  Table A17. I was able to exactly reproduce these estimates.  
Attrition  
A major concern in Jack and Suri’s  study is that their results may be affected by the high 
attrition rate in the panel surveys. This rate was initi ally about 33 per cent . As explained 
above, the interview strategy in the follow -up surveys was designed to reduce this rate to 
                                                
8 With respect to Table 7, Professor Suri communicated in private correspondence that the data 
were proprietary and she was, therefore, unable to share them. However, there was no indic ation 
of this in Jack and Suri’s published work. In fact, the accompanying ‘Data Read Me’ statement 
states that the Tegemeo Institute were in the process of making their data publicly available. 
Unfortunately, despite numerous attempts to contact the insti tute, I was unable to elicit a 
response.  8 a subsequent 24 per cent . For the non- Nairobi sample, the attrition rate was 18 per cent . 
Although  the authors  provide a discuss ion of the comparability of their attrition rates with 
other studies (footnote 19, page 192), they also conduct additional robustness checks to 
show that their results were not qualitatively affected by attrition.  
The first set of results are reported in t heir Table 8A. The results in the table come from a 
multivariate regression, in which  the dependent variable is a binary variable indicating 
whether the household did not attrite from the sample. My  replication results are reported 
in Appendix  Table A18. I am able to replicate all their results , with two exceptions: the 
estimates for ‘HH has a ROSCA account ’ and ‘HH has a SACCO account ’ are 
mistakenly switched in the results reported by Jack and Suri  (see grey-highlighted cells).  
The original authors  furthe r investigate the effects of attrition in their Table 8B. My 
corresponding replication results are reported in Appendix  Table A19. The first three 
columns address attrition , using the weighting strategy developed by Fitzgerald and 
colleagues  (1998). The remaining columns restrict the sample to communities with low 
attrition rates (the average attrition rate here is about 7 per cent ). Again, I  am able to 
exactly reproduce their estimates.  
Instrumental variable results  
The authors  take a further look at endog eneity in their Table 9. Here they address 
potential endogeneity concerns with M -PESA use by employing an instrumental variable 
(IV) procedure. Specifically, they instrument the two variables: M -PESA use and the M -
PESA interaction term. My replication results are reported in Appendix  Table A20. I was 
able to exactly reproduce their  estimates.  
Online appendix  
To further support the findings in their paper, Jack and Suri  provided additional analyses 
in their Online Appendix Tables 1– 3. Appendix  Table A21 reproduces their Online 
Appendix Table 1, which provides additional summary statistics by adoption status. They  
categorize three groups of households: early adopters, late adopters and non- adopters . 
Of the three, early adopters  – those who had adopted M -PESA i n period 1  – are 
wealthier, more educated and more likely to use formal financial services.  
Appendix Table A22 replicates Online Appendix Table 2 from the original paper . It 
reports the estimated effects of negative shocks on consumption and risk sharing a fter 
controlling for remittances. I  was able to exactly reproduce their estimates. Note that 
controlling for remittances reduces the magnitude of the ‘User  × Shock ’ coefficient and 
renders the estimates insignificant. Appendix  Table A23 reproduces Online A ppendix 
Table 3  from the original paper . The data come from rounds 3 and 4 of the survey. My  
replication exactly reproduces Jack and Suri ’s estimates.  
Web appendix  
The original paper mentions that some additional results using the unbalanced, three -
period panel data are  posted online.9 Unfortunately, I was unable to obtain these data 
                                                
9 These results are available at: 
http://mitsloan.mit.edu/shared/ods/documents/?DocumentID=2481  9 from the authors. Thus, I was not able to replicate the associated two t ables from their 
Web Appendix . 
2.2.4  Push- button and pure replication conclusions  
My analysis employ ed a push- button replication and the ‘ independent coding ’ method of 
pure replication to study Jack and Suri  (2014). I was able to reproduce all of the original 
paper’s  main findings, although I did discover some minor differences in the code and 
tables.  
Although  the authors provided us with most of the data I  needed to reproduce their 
results, they did not provide all the data required for a complete replication. As a result, I 
was unable to replicate all of their tables. Accordingly, my pure and push -button 
replica tion should be categorized as comparable but incomplete.  
Jack and Suri’s  original findings and my  replication provide strong empirical evidence 
that M -PESA has had a positive impact on people’s financial health. The financial 
benefits derived from such mobile money innovations can play a critical role in 
combat ting world poverty. To provide useful insights for future policy -making, there is a 
need for further robustness and sensitivity analyses of the original findings , as discussed  
in the following measure ment and estimation analysis  and theory of change analysis  
sections.  
3. Measurement and estimation analysis  
Although Jack and Suri (2014) conducted a thorough analysis, further robustness checks 
can be conducted to investigate the sensitivity of their finding s beyond the checks 
originally performed. In this section, I first look at the data and check the existence of 
outliers. I then asses s the strength of the original results to alternative statistica l and 
estimation methods . 
3.1 Detecting  outliers  
An outlier is considered as an observation that lies far outside the norm of a variable. The deleterious effects of outliers on statistical analysis have been discussed extensively by Osborn and Overbay (2004). The presence of outliers increases  error variance and 
reduc es the power of statistical tests. They can also distort regression estimates . There 
are many  reasons why outliers may arise,  but a common cause is  human error. Survey 
data seem particularly vulnerable to human error. For these reasons, an  analysis of 
outliers may prove insightful. My  analysis employ s a number of procedures available in 
Stata for the detection and replacement  or removal of outliers: discrepancy measures, 
leverage measures and influence measures (Williams 2016) . I consider both deletion of 
outliers and winsori sing of extreme values.  
3.1.1  Pre-estimation procedures 
Missing values  
Missing values are generally excluded from the regression analysis. However, since household surveys conducted between late 2008 and early 2010 (three rounds  or two 
periods ), two observations per household are available in the data  set. As a result, the 
households with missing values in one round are not fully dropped from the sample. This 10 could confound the results , as the change in the response of consumption and/or 
remitt ances over this period is of interest.  
To address this concern, households with missing values  in one round are dropped from 
the sample.10 Table 1 summarizes the results of this robustness check for OLS 
specification. It is worth mentioning that all the panel specifications  are robust to this 
alteration.  As Table 1 shows , the replication results are consistent with the original 
findings.

Extreme  values  
Extreme values are defined as observations in a sample that are highly unlikely to occur. 
A user -written command in Stata (Nick Cox’s extremes command, Cox 2004) provides 
an easy way of identifying the cases with the most extreme values (upper and lower 
bounds). Table 2  report s the lowest and highest values, respectively. T o decide how to 
handle these extreme values properly, I check the survey data for each round provided 
by the original authors.11  
                                                
10 There are two households with missing v alues in one round. I dropped these households (four 
observations) from the sample.  
11 These data sets are available at: 
https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse.xhtml?alias=mobil emoney  11 A closer look at the household with ID 1428005 reveals that the only reported 
expenditure for this household is monthly expenditures. Neither weekly expenditures nor 
annual expenditures are reported for this household;  as a result , the total expenditure is 
relatively low (6.174) with respect to its mean (10.859). T he weekly expenditures , 
according to the codebook , are defined as expenditures on foods.12 Therefore, I drop 
households for which no weekly expenditures are recorded.13  
As for other extreme values, except two cases highlighted in the  bottom panel of Table 2, 
all else seems  correct. The potential reasons for reporting as an unusual case are stated 
in the last column.  The extreme values can be easily detected by looking at the 
distribution demonstrated in Figure 1 . They are mainly located below the value of about 8 
and above 14 (the response variable is per capita consumption).

12 Total expenditures are defined as the sum of weekly, monthly and yearly expenditures.  
13 It might be acceptable not to have monthly and/or yearly expenditures, but it seems unusual not 
to spend on foods. Households with zero or missing weekly expenditures are as follows: 
1428005, 1433001 and 1280060 for zero values and 1603020, 1295003 and 112118 for missing 
values.  12 Figure 1: Distribution of per capita consumption, sample siz e 4,564 
 
Table 3  presents the results of Jack and Suri’s  basic specifications , once I drop all the 
households with zero or missing weekly expendi tures. The signs and sizes of the

In Table 5 , I show results for the sample,  excluding the common outliers explained 
earlier. The coefficient on the interaction of interest in column 4  – which shows the panel 
specification,  including the control for rural by time dummies and location by time 
dummies – is no longer significant at the 10 per cent  level. The main difference between 
this column (column 4) and the following column (column 6) is demographic controls. 
Although  the former is not controlling for household demographics, the latter control s for 
it. Thus, it could  indicate that when I exclude  the extreme values , the results are quite 
sensitive to demographic controls . The replication results for the other columns are 
consistent with the original findings.

The main challenge of a credible impact evaluation is to construct counterfactual 
outcome s; that is, id entifying  what would have happened to M -PESA users in the 
absence of M -PESA. Propensity score matching was developed to help design and 
analyse non- randomized observational studies so that they mimic  some of the 
characteristics of a randomi sed control led trial. It allow ed us to account for the possible 
differences in wealth, education and other socioeconomic characteristics between M -
PESA users and nonusers.  
As Table 6 shows , M-PESA users are wealthier, more educated  and more likely to own a 
cell phone, and  have better access to formal financial services , such as bank account.

Matching involves constructing a new control group using background characteristics , so 
that for every treated observation (M-PESA user) , there is an untreated one (nonuser) 
that is as si milar as possible in observable characteristics . Propensity score matching 
constructs a probability that a household adopts M -PESA conditional on its 
characteristics . This is done by running a binary probit regression of M -PESA users  and 
nonusers on the se t of observable baseline characteristics  (in particular , household 17 demographics, years of education of the household head, occupations for the household 
head, the use of bank accounts, the use of savings and credit cooperatives, the use of 
rotating savings  and credit associations , and cell phone ownership) . It can be written as:  
𝑃𝑃(𝑥𝑥)=𝑃𝑃𝑈𝑈𝑜𝑜𝑏𝑏[𝑇𝑇=1|𝑋𝑋=𝑥𝑥1,𝑥𝑥2,…,𝑥𝑥𝑘𝑘]=𝐸𝐸(𝑇𝑇|𝑋𝑋), (5) 
where 𝑇𝑇=1 for households using M -PESA and 0 otherwise, and 𝑋𝑋 is a vector of 
characteristics.  
To investigate the validity of the propensity score matching estimation, I need to verify  
the common support or overlap condition. This condition requires the  existence of a 
sufficient overlap between the propensity scores of treated and control groups. Through 
the following histogram ( Figure 2) and density distribution plots ( Figure 3 ), I am able to 
visually inspect whether  the matching is able to make the distributions more similar. F or 
the matching,  I use the nearest -neighbour matching method,  in which  each M -PESA 
user is matched to its nearest neighbour nonuser based on the propensity score. 
Performing 1:1 nearest -neighbour matching results in keeping , on average , 70 per cent  
of the sample. Increasing the matching ratio could increase precision but also bias.  
Figure 2: Histograms of matched sub- samples along common support  
 
18 Figure 3: Estimated probability of being an M -PESA user ( propensity score)  
 
First, the probability of being an M -PESA user , given the values of all potential 
confounders (the propensity score, PS, of being a user) , was es timated for each 
household in the sample. This was  done by estimating a probit regression model with all 
known confounders as predictors. Then, each user was  ‘matched’  with one nonuser, 
based on similar values of the propensity scores. This allowed construction of a control 
group as similar as possible to the treatment group of M -PESA users. In this way, 
propensity score matching tried  to mimic random assignment of households across 
treatment and control groups.  
Analytic weights were employed to account for  the fact that some nonuser households 
were matched to more than one user household. I then estimated  the specification in 
equation (3). 
Table 7  reports results of the basic specifications. From column (1), I see that a negative 
shock reduces per capita consumption of nonuser households by 21 per cent . This is 
consistent with the results reported in Table 4A. In contrast, households with M -PESA 
are better able to protect themselves against negative shocks. M -PESA users cut back 
consumption in the face of a negative shock by only 6 per cent  (–0.2127  + 0.1505). This 
figure is approximately half the size of the original paper but  still significant.  According to 
the last column , in which a  full set of controls is included, nonusers suffer from  
approximately  15 per cent  reduction in consumption (the corresponding figure is 7 per 
cent in Table 4A), whereas  users are able to smooth their consumption perfectly and 
experience no significant reduction in consumption. Across Table 7, the coefficient on 
the interaction o f interest is strongly significant. The results are robust to the new 
weighting system driven from propensity score matching.  Density

3.3 Tobit  model  
According to Jack  and Suri (2014) , remittances are  the main channel through which 
households can share risks in the event of any negative shocks. The role of remittances 
is examined by estimating the following specification,  reported as equation  (8) in the 
original paper:  
𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖= 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖+ 𝛾𝛾𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+ 𝜇𝜇𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+ 𝛽𝛽𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖×𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜃𝜃𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 +𝜋𝜋𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖+𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖, (6) 
where the dependent variable, 𝑈𝑈 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖, is a measure of remittances over the previous  six 
months. This variable can be measured as (i) the probability of receiving remittances , (ii) 
the number of remittances received or (iii) the total value of remittances received. It is 
worth mentioning that the last two outcome variables are not available (or , in other 
words , take the value of zero) for those households who never received any remittances.  20 Due to the censored nature of these two measures of remittances, common linear 
regressions  may produce biased estimates. The following graphs clearly demonstrate 
the frequency of zero observations ( Figure 4, sections A and B ).14 Given the zeros for 
nonusers, these variables have a skewed distribution.  
Figure 4: Number of remittances received (A) and total value received (B)  
 
(A)                                                                    (B)  
To avoid bias stemming from left -censoring in the dependent variable, I  employ a Tobit 
model , also called a censored regression model. Table 8 and Table 9 report the Tobit 
estimates of the number and total value of remittances received. Across the table, the 
interaction of interest is positive and significant, meaning that in the event of a negative shock , users receive more remittances in terms of the number received and total value. 
This conclusion i s consistent with the corresponding fixed effect model estimates from 
Table 5A.  
In fact , controlling for the censored  nature of remittance variables  increases  the size of 
coefficients on the interaction term.
15 In Table 8 and Table 9, I report the original  findings 
on the grey -highlighted columns. The next two columns report multilevel mixed effects 
Tobit regressions , with and without left -censoring limit.  
                                                
14 Due to the large frequency of zeros compared to the other values, the bar charts in the right -
hand side of Figure 4 (B) are not obv ious here.  
15 The reason why I also report the results corresponded to the Tobit without controlling for left -
censoring is to show that the estimated effects are not far from the original results, once the left -
censoring issue is taken into account. It is w orth mentioning that these estimates are not 
particularly large if they are compared to the average size: the mean values for ‘Number received’ 
and ‘Total received (square root)’ are 2.067 and 68.50, respectively.  0 .2 .4 .6 .8Density

3.4 Endogeneity and IV regressions  
Jack and Suri  provide a discussion of potential  sources of endogeneity in the basic 
specification ( equation 7 in the paper):  
𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖= 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖+ 𝛾𝛾𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+ 𝜇𝜇𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝛽𝛽𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖×𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜃𝜃𝑆𝑆𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖×𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜃𝜃𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+
𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 +𝜋𝜋𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖+𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (7) 
They then explain that, to identify the causal effect of M -PESA on risk  shari ng, I must 
assume the interaction term 𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖×𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is exogenous or uncorrelated with error 
term.  
3.4.1  Endogeneity of shocks  
The authors  emphasize that their identification assumption is satisfied if shocks are truly 
exogenous . They argue t hat this may be reasonable,  for two reasons:  (i) households 
were asked in the survey to report only unexpected events that affect ed them ; and (ii) 
reported shocks are not systematically correlated with a number of household- level 
variables.  23 Income shock s are correlated with consumption changes and remittances, as would be 
expected, but they are not correlated with other household characteristics , nor with 
access to agents or M -PESA use. They report these correlations in Table 3, page 202.  
3.4.2  Endogeneity of M-PESA use 
The authors  also argue  that any endogeneity of M -PESA use due to selective adoption 
associated with wealth or other unobservables should be absorbed in the main effect of 
being a user (self -selection effects into using M -PESA are absorbed into c oefficient 𝜇𝜇 on 
𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖). Although they do not report results relating M -PESA usage to household 
characteristics, they control for these by adding 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (a vector of controls  – in particular, 
household demographics, household head years of education and occupation dummies, 
the use of financial instruments  and a dummy for cell phone ownership) in all the 
regressions. They also control for unobservable characteristics of households by using fixed effects. They  argue that this approach allows for unobser vables to be correlated 
with M -PESA use, as long as those unobservables do not interact with the response to 
shock.  
However, fixed effects do not correct all sources of endogeneity . For instance, people 
who are especially innovative might  be more willing t o adopt M -PESA than their 
counterparts , while choosing strategies that minimize their exposure to shocks. 
Alternatively, people who  live in places that experience more shocks might be more 
willing to adopt M -PESA. In such cases, estimates of the interactio n coefficient for 
shocks and M -PESA use would be biased.  
To deal with endogeneity  concerns , Jack and Suri  propose two strategies:  (i) they extend 
equation (6) to include interactions of the shock variable with all observable covariates ; 
and (ii) they use a gent rollout data and incorporate that in a  standard IV procedure 
(equation (4)). They  argue that the agent variable (geographic proximity to the agents as 
indicators of access) is  exogenous.  
This latter statement is debatable. There are reasons to suppor t that M -PESA agents are 
not exogenously distributed across geographical areas.  M-PESA agents receive a 
commission on a sliding scale for deposits and withdrawals but not for transactions . 
Thus, there is an incentive for M -PESA agents to locate where they can gain the greatest 
profit. It seems likely that wealthier areas would provide greater profit opportunities , 
because there is the potential for larger sums of money to be handled.  
I first address this concern by controlling for the interactions between observable 
individual characteristics and shock s. The specification would then be as follows:  
𝐶𝐶
𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖= 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖+𝛾𝛾𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜗𝜗𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑈𝑈𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝛽𝛽𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑈𝑈𝐴𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖×𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜃𝜃𝑆𝑆𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖×𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜃𝜃𝑀𝑀𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+
𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜋𝜋𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖+𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (8) 
The results are presented in Table 10. As can be seen, whenever demographic controls 
are available, I  also control for the interaction of the shock with all observable covariates. 
This means I am not adding this control factor for column 2 (the grey -highlighted 
column). Of the eight coefficients on the interaction of interest, the first six remain 
statistically significant.  24 However, when I test for weak instruments, I find evidence of weak instrument s in every 
specification other than the  original paper’s specification (column 2) . For the Wald test, 
when there are two endogenous variables and four instruments, S tock and Yogo (2005)  
suggest a critical value of 11.16 In every specification other than column 2, the 
Kleibergen– Paap test statistic is less than the critical value, indicating the instruments 
inadequately address bias and size issues.17

16 The Cragg and Donald (1993) statistics can be used to assess the overall strength of the 
instruments, and Stock and colleagues (2005) have tabulated critical values of the minimum 
eigenvalue of the Cragg– Donald statistics for testing whether the instrument is weak. This critical 
value (which is  equal to 11) is reported in brackets for the comparison.  
17 Like Jack and Suri (2014), I also report the F -stat form of the Kleibergen –Paap statistic, the 
heteroskedastic and clustering robust version of the Cragg– Donald statistic suggested by Stock 
and co lleagues (2005) as a test for weak instruments. All statistics are well below the critical value 
(except the second column), confirming the possibility of weak instrument.  25 In the next step , I report results for some of the first -stage regression s. Although  Jack 
and Suri  do not provide the associated first -stage results in their paper, they do indicate 
that predicting M-PESA use is not  very precise in some cases. Table 11 reports my 
results . For space reasons, I show the first -stage results for cross -section and the most 
comprehensive panel (column 5,  above). I also report the first -stage regression s when 
the outcome variable is a measu re of remittances.  
I then evaluate whether the instrument applied in the original paper is weak . The 
proposed instruments for the use of M -PESA and their interactions with shock according 
to paper are as follows:  (i) distance to the closest agent , (ii) the number of agents within 
5 kilometres  of the household and (iii) the interaction of each with the shock . 
As observed from the first -stage results, distance to the closest agent and the number of 
agents within 5 kilometres  of the household are not very strong determinants of M -PESA 
adoption. This is confirmed by  small first -stage F -statistic. The Kleibergen –Paap F-
statistics for the weak instrument test are not always larger than critical value for the 
Stock –Yogo , which creates  the possibility of weak instru ment problem.  
As noted in my earlier discussion about legitimacy of the chosen instruments, I  planned 
to replace the instrument with potential alternatives. My  planned approach was to find an  
instrument (or a set of instruments) correlated with M -PESA use (relevant) but not 
affect ing consumption smoothing (exogenous). In the literature, Mbiti and Weil (2011) 
apply an alternative instrument for M -PESA use in Kenya. They focus on the 2006 
perception data (before the advent of M -PESA in 2007) and explain that the survey 
included  a question referring to the perceptions of the most common money transfer 
methods. The households were then asked to identify the slowest, riskiest  and most 
costly transfer methods. They conclude that those households who felt their means of 
transfer was not efficient were  more likely to adopt M -PESA after its introduction. I 
check ed the survey instrument (questionnaire) and codebook to see whether such a 
perception question was available. It turns out that there is a question asking about the  
method used to send money , followed by a  question on the reason why the method was 
used ( easy, cheap, safe, fast  and other). Unfortunately, I  was unable to construct this 
instrument , due to the unavailability of data . 
The combination of (i) concern over weak instruments and (ii) charac teristics differences 
between M -PESA users and nonusers serves to weaken the strength of Jack and Suri’s 
arguments.  26 Table 11: IV results ( cross- section and panel), first -stage estimations

Jack and Suri  conducted five surveys across Kenya between 2008 and 2014. These 
data sets are publicly available through the FSD Kenya website.18 Since the original 
study made  use of only the first three rounds (or two periods), my provisional plan was to 
extend the years of analysis to the most recent available (see Table 13). Unfortunately, 
data from round 4 is not publicly available. Despite data availability for round 5, I  was 
unable to match households over time.19 In addition,  as the authors  mention in the ‘ Data 
Read Me’  file, some variables that contain personally identifiable information are dropped 
from the data sets. As a result , this plan could not be completed . Instead, I dropped  265 
households cor responding to the third round. Therefore, no further control for the 
difference in the timing of the survey between rounds 2 and 3 is required.

Jack and Suri  provide a description of their survey data in Section III of the ir paper. They 
explain that the number of households surveyed in the first round (September 2008) was 
3,000. However, they were not able to find the original (full) sample in the follow -up 
surveys conducted in December 2009 and June 2010. As a result, the total number of 
households interviewed in 2009 was 2,017. This number dropped to 1,595 in the following year (2010), 265 of whom were not interviewed in 2009. In other words, there 
were only 1,330 (1,595  – 265 = 1,330) comm on among the three rounds.
20 This means 
an attrition rate of  about 56 per cent . In order to reduce the high attrition rate, the authors  
add two panels of 2,017 (from round 2) and 265 (from round 3) together , which are 
lumped together  as a ‘ second period’ . This strategy allows them to construct a balanced, 
two-period panel of 2,282 households. They distinguish the time differences in period 2 
by including a time fixed effect .21  
To check for robustness, I restrict ed my analysis to a sample comprising  those 
interviewed in the first two rounds. This allow ed me to construct a balanced, two-period 
panel of 2,017 households in lieu of 2,282. Table 14 and Table 15 report the results of 
basic specifications presented in Table 4A of Jack and Suri’s  paper , while using a 
restricted sample. Since the second period refers only to the second round (it previously 
referred to the second and third rounds), I do not control for round (time) dummies  
                                                
18 The data is publicly available at: http://fsdkenya.org/dataset/m -pesa- panel -survey -kenya -2014/  
19 I checked some demographics –  such as gender, which is fixed over time –  to see whether 
households could be matched through the unique household identifier (hhid)  provided for all the 
subsets. As it turns out, it could not be matched. This was also confirmed through private 
correspondence with Professor Suri.  
20 According to footnote 20, the three- period balanced panel includes 1,311 households.  
21 Period 2 involves rounds 2 and 3.  29 throughout the regression analysis presented in Table 15. On the other hand,  Table 14 
repor ts the results for this restricted sample,  while still including time (round) dummies.

According to the baseline results in Table 15 , the last two columns are identical. This 
means that once I am not controlling for time – and therefore its interaction with location 
and rural areas  – these additional dummies have no impact on my  results. Although  the 
general conclusions remain the same, the first column shows that in the event o f 
negative shocks , per capita consumption for users fall s by 15 per cent . The 
corresponding estimate from the full sample in Table 4A is 12 per cent .22

3.6 Multi level fixed effects with multiway clustering  
Finally, I conduct ed an additional robustness check to examine whether the main results 
are robust to an alternative estim ation that considers  multilevel fixed effects  – namely 
households, locations and time fixed effects. I  further included two-way clustering 
(households and locations). The corresponding results are reported in Table 16. As can 
be seen, these estimates are c onsistent with the original findings.  31 Table 16: Basic difference- in-differences results, multilevel fixed effects with multiway clusteri ng

Thus far, it is clear  that the results in Jack and Suri  (2014) are robust to alternative 
measurement and estimation analysis, confirming that M -PESA users , compared  to 
nonusers, are better  able to protect their consumption in the event of a negative shock . 
This is mainly attributed to associated reduction in transaction costs. The remaining 
question is whether the effect is heterogeneous , depending on the rural –urban status. In 
this section, I shift the focus of analysis to answer this question.  
The main focus  of the Jack and Suri  (2014) study is Kenyan households across a large 
part of the country , regardless of their residence locations (rural or urban area).23 
According to the discussion in the original study, urban households have higher rates  of 
attrition than their rural counterparts. For this and other reasons, most of the analysis is 
limited to the non- Nairobi sample.24 Although this concern has merit, less is known about 
the impact of M -PESA on the risk -sharing capability of rural households in particular . 
Table 17  reports summary statistics by rural –urban status over the two periods. These 
two groups are quite different in terms of variables such as demographics, financial 
services use and occupations. Most specifically, rural households’ access to formal  
financial services , such as  bank accounts , is relatively low. Interestingly, Table 17 shows 
there was a  small decrease in the use of bank accounts for rural households between 
the two periods (grey -highlighted rows). Given the heterogeneity observed in the 
availability of alternative financial services in rural and urban area, it would be of great 
interest to see whether the risk -sharing impact of M -PESA adoption differs depending on 
the residence location.  
There is relatively little  literature  that focuses on the use of financial institutions in rural 
areas. One exception is Munyegera and Matsumoto (2016) . Their study was motivated 
by the belief that most formal financial institutions are concentrated in the urban areas,  
where people are better  able to smooth their consumption against negative shocks. They 
find that remittances receipt is a crucial source of informal insurance for poor rural 
households in Uganda.  
  
                                                
23 Due to the limited coverage of cell phone towers and M- PESA agents, the residents of the north 
and northeas t parts of the country were excluded from the sample.  
24 Nairobi is the capital and largest city of Kenya.  33 Table 17: Summary statistics (period 1, rural v ersus urban )

In order to see whether the impact of M -PESA adoption on consumption smoothing 
differ ed among the households who reside in rural areas compared to their urban 
counterparts, I focus ed the analysis on an exclusively rural sample. Table 18 presents 
results of bas ic specifications for three different samples,  including full sample and rural 
and urban sub- samples. According to the baseline results, regardless of being an M -
PESA user  or nonuser , rural households experience similar reductions in per capita 
consumption (see the bottom rows). However, these two coefficients are not significantly 
different from zero.  
The coefficient on the interaction of interest is no longer significant in panels 2 and 3,  
once I look at the rural and urban sub- samples. However, once a f ull set of control 
variables is considered (panels 4 and 5), users in urban areas are able to smooth shocks 
perfectly , and even experience an 8 per cent  increase in consumption. Nonusers for the 35 same sub- sample, on the other hand, suffer a 6 per cent  (non-significant ) reduction. 
Looking at the rural sub- sample when a full set of control variables is included, I find that 
users are able to smooth consumption,  and experience a 3 per cent  increase in 
consumption (far lower than the urban counterparts) , whereas  nonusers suffer an 8 per 
cent reduction (none of these estimates is  significant).

Notes : Columns 10 and 11 are columns 4 and 5 in Table 4A. Given that I  run separate 
estimations for urban and rural sample, I  exclude the location- level control variables. As a result, 
panels 4 and 5 become identical.  ***, **, * Significant at 1, 5 and 10 per cent  levels. 
Given that households who reside within a village may experience village- level 
aggre gate shock s, I check the robustness of the research findings by clustering at the 
village level. The results are reported in Table 19. Looking at the last column,  which 
includes the full set of controls, I  find that the effects for users and nonusers are no 
longer significantly different from zero.   
Therefore, the theory of change analysis does  not support the idea that the risk-sharing 
impact of M -PESA adoption differs depending on the residence location.  37 Table 19: Basic difference- in-differences results, multilevel fixed effects with multiway clustering (clustered at households and

***, **, *  Significant at 1, 5 and 10 per cent  levels.38 5. Conclusions  
Jack and Suri (2014) explore the impact of mobile money on informal risk sharing. They 
find that the introduction o f M-PESA facilitates the redistribution of finances across 
geographical distances. This  has improved households’ ability to spread risk , which  is 
mainly attributed to the associated reduction in transaction costs. As a result, M -PESA 
has been able to lift  many Kenyan households out of poverty  (Suri and Jack 2016).   
My replication study consist ed of three parts : (i) push -button and pure replication,  (ii) 
measurement and estimation analysis and (iii) theory of change analysis. First, I 
employ ed the procedures  of push- button replication and the ‘independent coding ’ 
method of pure replication to study Jack and Suri  (2014). I was able to reproduce all of 
the main findings  from the original paper , although I discover ed some minor differences 
in the code and tables . Accordingly, my pure and push- button replication is categori sed 
as comparable but incomplete.  
Second, I examined  whether their results were  robust to a number of changes . I first 
looked at the data and check ed the existence of outliers. I  then assess ed the robustness 
of findings to alternative statistical and estimation methods. I interpret my results as 
indicating that the original results are robust to different specification and approaches.  
Finally, given the heterogeneity observed in the availability of alternative financial 
services in rural and urban areas , it is of great interest to see whether the risk -sharing 
impact of M -PESA adoption differ ed depending on the residence location. Therefore, I  
changed  the focus of analysis from the entire population , including rural and urban 
residents , to the rural segment of the population. The latter is of interest because this 
population is  supposedly excluded by formal financial services . This examination 
addresses M -PESA promise of providing  ‘banking for the unbanked’ . However, my 
analysis did not identify significant differences between urban and rural residents in the 
benefits received from M -PESA.  
Jack and Suri ’s findings and my replication provide strong empirical evidence that M -
PESA has had a positive impact on people’s financial health in Kenya. The financial 
benefits derived from such mobile money innovations can play a vital  role in combat ting 
world poverty. Policymakers should take one crucial step – to adopt enabling policies 
that allow competing firm s to offer innovative new technologies such as M -PESA.

  60 Appendix B: Proposed but undone robustness checks  
Since my analysis plan was written with minimum interaction with the data, I was unable 
to confirm with certainty whether I  am eventually able to obtain the data. These 
robustness checks are those I  initially plan ned to implement  but were unable to 
complete,  however, due mainly to the unavailability of data.   
Placebo test 
My next approach considered running a placebo test. The idea behind the  placebo test is 
that different outcomes between M -PESA users and nonusers could be due to 
unobserved factors that were correlated with the adoption of M -PESA. My planned 
approach was to analyse the period immediately preceding the introduction of M -PESA 
and compare outcomes between ‘ future M -PESA users ’ and ‘future M -PESA nonusers ’. 
If I observe differences between these two groups in the period before the advent of M -
PESA that suggests that subsequent differences might be due to factors other than M -
PESA.  However, if no differences are  observed in the pre -M-PESA period that supports 
the idea that subsequent differences are, in fact, due to the introduction of M -PESA.  
My planned approach was to use data from a four -period panel household agricultural 
survey  collected by the Tegemeo Institute over the years 1997– 2007  (Tegemeo n.d.) ,25 
which preceded the introduction of M -PESA. I would create a dummy variable for the 
households that would later use M -PESA after its introduction in 2007 and then estimate 
the fol lowing specification:  
𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖= 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖+ 𝛾𝛾𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+ 𝜇𝜇𝑀𝑀𝑃𝑃𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+ 𝛽𝛽𝑀𝑀𝑃𝑃𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖×𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜃𝜃𝑠𝑠𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖×𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+
 𝜃𝜃𝑀𝑀𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜂𝜂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 +𝜋𝜋𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖+𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,  (A – 1) 
where 𝑀𝑀𝑃𝑃𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a dummy variable which takes the value of one if a household later 
used M -PESA and zero otherwise. If the estimated coefficient for 𝑀𝑀𝑃𝑃𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 were 
insignificant this would support the hypothesis that the observed M -PESA effect was re al 
and not due to unobservable characteristics of households or the location of agents.  
Unfortunately, I was unable to run the test due to the unavailability of data. I  also tried to 
use FinAccess 2006, 2009 and 2013 surveys. However, the data on shocks were not 
collected in those surveys.26 
Heterogeneous slopes  
In order to address the potential bias resulting from unobserved, time- invariant 
household heterogeneity, the fixed effects model has been estimated throughout the 
original paper. However, as a further robustness check, I planned to allow for 
heterogeneous individual specific slope on the shock variable to examine to what extent 
                                                
25 The household survey data for 2006 has been recently publicly available 
(http://fsdkenya.org/dataset/finaccess -household- 2006/ ). Thus, I can see which of these two data 
sets may help me to conduct this test.  
26 FinAccess household surveys for several years are publicly available via: 
https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse.xhtml?alias=fsdkenya  61 the results on 𝛽𝛽 , the coefficient on the interaction of interest, are robust to this change. 
My planned approach was to add an interaction between household fixed effects, 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖, and 
shock variable, 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖. The following specification control for such possibility:  
𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖= 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖+ 𝛾𝛾𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+ 𝜇𝜇𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝛽𝛽𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖×𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜃𝜃𝑆𝑆𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖×𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜃𝜃𝑀𝑀𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+
𝜔𝜔𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖+𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 (A – 2) 
In other words, I would control for any effects unobservable time- invariant household 
specific may have had on the ability of households to smooth i ncome shocks. However, 
the major concern to regress the above mention specification is that the associated 
estimates might be biased due to the short time series available in the original study ( for 
example, three rounds of panel data). To avoid such a pot ential bias, my planned 
approach was to use five rounds of household panel survey data over the years 2008 
and 2014 conducted by the original authors  after this study for another research paper  
(Jack and Suri 2016) . Unfortunately, given that the T is small  and there is no access to 
the follow -up surveys, I  was unable to conduct this test.
