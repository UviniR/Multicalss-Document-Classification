Working Paper 506 
March 2019Midline Effects of a Randomized 
Controlled Trial to Increase the 
Utilization of Financial Services by 
Women Business Owners in Rural 
Indonesia
Abstract
This is the report of  a midline evaluation of  a randomized controlled trial to increase the 
utilization of  saving and other financial services by women business owners in Indonesia. The trial 
was motivated by a recent law in Indonesia supporting the development of  branchless banking 
services for a large unbanked rural population and by the results of  several studies suggesting 
that it is possible to stimulate savings and improve a range of  downstream outcomes with 
suitable interventions targeted to under-banked rural populations. The trial was conducted in 400 
purposively selected rural and semi-urban villages in five districts of  East Java province in which 
branchless banking services (including basic savings accounts accessible through mobile phones) 
were available. The randomized interventions supported by this trial include both supply-side 
treatments (higher agent incentives) and demand-side treatments (training and mentoring of  female 
business owners). The data analyzed include both baseline and midline survey data on female and 
male business owners and branchless banking agents. Implementation of  the trial was delayed due 
to difficulties in recruiting suitable agents in all 400 trial villages. Numerous supply-side problems, 
both technical and logistical, were also reported in the monitoring data. However, the midline 
results indicate that the interventions were successfully delivered, resulting in significant positive 
effects on key intermediate outcomes, including knowledge and use of  mobile banking services and 
initial take up of  a mobile basic savings account. Downstream effects indicate that the supply- and 
demand-side interventions, particularly in combination, increased women business owners’ savings, 
empowerment, self-confidence, and economic welfare.

  1 Preface  
In 2015, the Center for Global Development (CGD) launched a collaboration with research 
and implementing partners to conduct two complementary field experiments. The 
randomized control trials test the impact of mobile savings and business training on 
women ’s businesses and incomes in Indonesia and Tanzania. This study, by James C. 
Knowles, analyzes short -term results of the Indonesia experiment on women entrepreneurs, 
using baseline data and short -term survey results for over 2,300 men and women business 
owners and 200 bank agents, constituting half of the baseline sample in East Java. The study 
is part of the empirical work informing CGD’s Evidence -based Report Series on Women’s Economic 
Empowerment . 
The Government of Indonesia has encouraged the development of branchless banking 
services, but little is known about the actual impact on customers’ savings and business 
growth —particularly women customers. Evidence on what works to increase uptake of 
mobile financial services is also slim. This analysis shows h ow differing incentives for bank 
agents affect uptake of the mobile product and how business training may bolster this effect. Importantly, the study demonstrates that the combination of both supply -side and demand-
side treatments is the largest enhancer o f women’s total savings. It also increased women 
business -owners’ self -confidence, economic welfare, and empowerment, the last measured 
by reported independence in household decision -making. Annex E (not included in the 
report’s main body) shows that the e mpowerment effect was concentrated on women 
reporting low levels of empowerment at baseline. This suggests that the combined treatment 
has a real impact on women’s agency. Testing the sustainability of these effects is underway: 
a follow -up measure for the  full sample was completed early this year with financing from 
the World Bank East Asia and the Pacific Gender Innovation Lab, with results forthcoming later in the year.  
This work was funded by a grant from the ExxonMobil Foundation to CGD. Partners 
include the World Bank African Gender Innovation Lab, the World Bank East Asia and 
Pacific Innovation Lab, Mercy Corps Indonesia, J -PAL South East Asia, Technoserve, 
Vodacom Tanzania, Arifu and researchers at Northwestern University, the University of Pompeu Fa bra, and Australian National University. SurveyMeter Indonesia and Savannas 
Forever Tanzania undertook the field data collection. Our deep gratitude goes to the 
entrepreneurs in Indonesia and Tanzania who participated in the studies.

  2 1. Introduction  
This is the midline report of an impact evaluation of a trial (Mobile Financial Services for 
Female Business owners) to increase the utilization of saving and other financial services 
among women busine ss owners in 400 predominantly rural villages of five districts of East 
Java province, Indonesia.1 The available evidence indicates that Indonesian women business 
owners are substantially under -banked relative to male business owners, and possibly as a 
consequence, have lower savings, fewer business assets and lower business incomes (World 
Bank 2016, Buvinic, Knowles and Witolear 2018). Savings are important not only as a source 
of funds for investment and growth of businesses but also because of their role  in 
smoothing consumption spending over time and providing protection from shocks. 
Evidence from several studies suggests that improved access to savings accounts, through 
lowering transactions costs, leads to increased savings and, ultimately, to increase d business 
investment and higher incomes among female business owners (Ashraf, Karlin and Yin 2006, Burgess and Pande 2005, Dupas, Green et al. 2012, De Mel, McIntosh and Woodruff 
2013, Dupas and Robinson 2013, Schaner 2013, Prina 2015, Suri and Jack 2016) . However, 
the literature also indicates that there are several important constraints to the use of financial 
services and savings, including both pecuniary and non -pecuniary transactions costs, lack of 
trust in financial institutions, regulatory barriers,  information and knowledge gaps, social 
constraints and behavioral biases (Karlan, Ratan and Zinman 2014). Several of these 
constraints affect women in particular, who tend to have less free time and reduced mobility, less education, and whose financial re sources are more vulnerable to competing demands 
from spouses. Although many women save, they are more likely to use informal channels, such as ROSCAs, or to save in the form of assets (e.g., jewelry, livestock) that provide lower 
returns and greater risks.  
To promote financial inclusion, the Government of Indonesia has encouraged several large 
banks to develop branchless banking services, including basic savings accounts that are 
supported by village -based agents and that can be accessed using mobile phone s. However, 
little is known about the most effective ways to promote branchless banking services. The 
trial evaluated here helps fill that gap by supporting both supply -side and demand- side 
interventions designed, initially, to increase access to, take up and use of formal savings accounts and, ultimately, to increase women business owners’ savings and incomes. The 
interventions were randomized within an experimental design that makes it possible to assess the effectiveness  and cost effectiveness  of both the supply and demand -side interventions, 
both separately and in combination. Because the trial is limited to villages in which branchless banking services are available, the impact evaluation does not address the impact 
of establishing branchless banking se rvices in villages in which they do not already exist.

1 The districts include: Tuban, Bojonegoro, Ngawi, Lamongan and Gresik, with a combined 2010 population of 
5.56 million . 
2 It was decided not to include a set of pure control villages because the Government had already established a 
law promoting branchless banking.  3 This midline report is based on data collected both at baseline and after 2 -12 months of trial 
implementation in 200 of the 400 villages included in the trial. The report includes the 
following additi onal sections: background and justification, interventions, experimental 
design and random assignment, data, balance and sample attrition, analysis, discussion and 
conclusions.  
2. Background and Justification  
Indonesia has recently adopted a law to promote  branchless banking as a means to increase 
access to financial services among its large presently unbanked population.3 The Indonesian 
model of branchless banking ( Laku Pandai  or LP)4 uses village -based agents and mobile 
telephones to provide basic banking  services, including basic savings accounts , credit and 
financing for micro businesses, micro insurance and other government- approved financial 
products (Lytle 2018). The agents are mostly existing shop- owners  who are authorized  to 
accept cash deposits and  make cash disbursements from customers’ savings accounts , 
functions that are normally performed at branch offices or by ATMs . The LP basic savings 
accounts are free of account opening fees, have a maximum balance of Rp. 20 million 
(equivalent to roughly US$1,400), a monthly maximum cash withdrawal or transfer of Rp. 5 
million and are interest bearing. They are intended to supplement digital wallet (LKD)5 
products already offered by several banks and retail firms. Credit and financing for LP 
custom ers have a maximum loan period of one year and a maximum loan value of Rp. 20 
million.  
Indonesia’s branchless banking system has the potential to reduce substantially both the pecuniary and non -pecuniary transactions costs of opening and using savings acc ounts.
6 
Users are able to check balances and to make payments and transfers using their mobile phones, and they are able to use the expanding network of village agents to open accounts 
and to make cash deposits and withdrawals without having to travel to bank branches. Agents also assist users to prepare the paperwork necessary to open an account and are 
responsible for transmitting the completed paperwork to branch offices for processing. Only 
the account holders and their banks have access to account bala nces, which makes them less 
vulnerable to the demands of spouses and other social claimants.  
Five large Indonesian banks have already been approved to provide branchless banking, and more are expected to be approved in the future. Although branchless bank ing services have 
been established in some areas, take up has been slow. Constraints to take up include: (1) 
                                                      
3 OJK Regulation No. 19/POJK .03/2014 dated 18 November 2014 (“ Laku Pandai  Regulat ion”).  
4 “Laku Pandai” is an Indonesian acronym for the provision of banking and other financial services without 
branch offices.  
5 LKD is an acronym for layanan keungan digital , Indonesian for “digital financial services,” which is an electronic 
payment a nd transfer system already in wide use.  
6 A recent meta -analysis of the results of 13 randomized controlled experiments with interventions limited to 
reducing the transactions costs of opening and using basic savings accounts obtained a random -effects point 
estimate of the mean proportion of trial participants taking up an account of 0.46, with a 95 percent confidence 
interval of 0.26 to 0.65 (Knowles 2018).  4 poor and/or limited internet services in many rural areas, (2) the limited internet and 
financial skills of potential customers, and (3) insufficie nt training and lack of motivation of 
branchless banking agents. The trial whose midline effects are evaluated in this report is designed to increase the take up and utilization of basic savings accounts, particularly among 
currently under -banked women bus iness owners in predominantly rural areas through 
mutually supportive supply - and demand -side interventions. On the supply side, the trial has 
provided training and mentoring to all branchless banking agents while varying randomly the level of their financ ial incentives from enrolling new clients in a basic savings account. On 
the demand side, the trial has provided training, mentoring and follow -up contacts to 
randomly -selected female business owners in the villages in which branchless banking 
services are  available.  
Incentive schemes that reward good performance (bonus, promotion based on performance) 
have been shown to be effective  in many contexts. In Rwanda, for example , higher 
performance pay has been found to increase health workers’  effort and performance 
(Basinga et al 2010, Gertler and Vermeesch 2012, de Walque et al.  2015). However, there 
have been very few trials testing the effectiveness of supply -side incentives in financial 
services. One exception is an RCT conducted in India that included a t reatment arm 
providing a one -percent commission to agents enrolling customers in a long -run savings 
product (Basu and Bisht 2015). During initial piloting of the treatment, however, it was 
determined that agents would make no effort to promote the product in the absence of the 
one-percent commission. Accordingly, it was decided to provide the one percent 
commission to all agents, thereby eliminating the possibility of measuring its separate effect. The effectiveness of training is less well established (Kar lin, Ratan and Zinman 2014). In an 
RCT conducted on the island of Java in Indonesia, for example, a carefully designed 2 -hour 
financial literacy training had no significant effect on the take up of a basic savings account, whereas a small financial incenti ve (ranging from $3 to $14) had a large effect on the 
likelihood of opening an account (Cole, Sampson and Bia 2009).  
3. Description of the Interventions  
3.1 Supply -Side Interventions  
The supply -side interventions were randomly assigned to branchless banking agents in 
selected villages. The trial villages are rural or semi- urban villages in which the trial’s partner 
bank planned to establish (or in some cases had already established) branchless banking services. The bank’s branchless banking  savings accounts earn an annual interest rate of 0.15 
percent, which is substantially lower than that of a competing bank (4 percent). Accordingly, another criterion for village selection was that, to the extent possible, the competing bank 
was not provid ing branchless banking products in the village at the time. As previously 
mentioned, there is no control group in the trial for whom branchless banking services are 
not available.  5 In each sample village, the bank recruited a branchless banking agent using its standard 
selection criteria (the selected agents were in many cases clients with a good credit history).7 
The bank agreed to try to hire women agents whenever possible. It turned out that recruiting agents in the 400 trial villages and developing the m anagerial and supervisory capacity in the 
participating bank to support them was much more of a challenge than anticipated, and trial staff ended up having to assist the bank to recruit agents in many of the 400 villages.
8 It was 
originally planned to cond uct the study in only three districts (Ngawi, Bojonegoro and 
Tuban), but two additional districts were added in order to achieve the targeted number of 400 villages. A total of 400 a gents were recruited , trained and mentored in batches , 47 
percent of whom were women.
9  
All agents were trained and mentored by Mercy Corps Indonesia (MCI), the first batch 
during the period December 2016 to July 2017 and the remaining agents during the period 
August 2017 to June 2018.10 The agent training was provided in one per sonal (one -on-one) 
session that averaged about 3 hours in length (but that varied from 2.5 to 4 hours) in which 
the agent learned how to use the on- line branchless banking software and the features and 
relative advantages of the branchless banking products . These included the basic savings 
(LP) account as well as a digital wallet (LKD) account.11 The agent training also included a 
module on marketing that emphasized the potential value of marketing to under -banked 
groups, particularly women. Following the ag ents’ initial training, MCI and partner bank staff 
provided one -on-one mentoring in three subsequent visits during which monitoring data 
were also collected. The mentoring visits were intended to be provided at one -week intervals 
following the initial training. However, among the 94 percent of all agents completing the 
training and mentoring, only 19 percent completed it within 21 days, as planned, after having 
completed their initial training while 30 percent needed 43 or more days to complete it.12 
Due to the delays in recruiting and training the agents, 117 of the 200 agents in the midline 
sample completed their training and mentoring less than six months before the Midline 
Survey (February 2018).  
                                                      
7 The standard criteria are: (1) the owner is a previous borrower from the bank, (2) the business is  in a central 
location in the village, (3) the owner is mostly present at the business premises, (4) the owner has a good 
reputation among villagers (as confirmed by the village chief), (5) the owner is able to demonstrate sufficient 
financial liquidity, ( 6) the owner is not an agent for another bank, and (6) the owner is willing to participate as an 
agent.  
8 Most of the assistance was provided by the staff of the organization providing the training and mentoring, i.e., 
Mercy Corps Indonesia (MCI), with add itional assistance provided by staff of the Indonesia  regional office of the 
Poverty Action Lab.  
9 38 agents subsequently resigned, and one was terminated by the bank. Replacements were recruited during the 
period and subsequently trained and mentored.  
10 MCI monitoring data.  
11 Unregistered LKD accounts have a maximum balance of Rp. 1 million and can only be used for payments. 
However, when registered by an agent, the maximum balance is Rp. 5 million, and the account can also be used for transfers and withdrawals.  
12 In the midli ne sample, among the 100 percent of agents completing the third monitoring visit, only 13 percent 
completed it within 21 days, while 38 percent completed it within 43 days or more.  6 The duties of branchless banking agents include: (1) promoting the take up and use of 
branchless banking products in their villages, (2) identifying and enrolling new clients, and 
(3) supporting existing clients. Agents earn a fee for each new LP savings account client 
identified as well as a fee for each client’s  deposits and withdrawals. The standard agent fee 
for identifying a new LP client that deposits at least Rp. 20,000 (approximately US$1.54) and who maintains an average savings balance of Rp. 20,000 over two weeks is Rp. 2,000 (about US$0.15). This is the “low -incentive treatment” in the trial. The “high- incentive treatment” 
is Rp. 10,000 (about US$0.77) for each new client identified. In addition, all agents earn Rp. 
1,000 for each cash deposit of minimum Rp. 10,000 and Rp. 2,500 for cash withdrawals 
under  Rp. 200,000 and Rp. 4,000 for cash withdrawals of Rp. 200,000 and above.  
Because the level of incentives that agents receive may affect potential clients’ perceptions of 
the product, the trial also provided an informational treatment (orthogonal to the main agent 
incentive treatment) about the level of incentives in randomly selected villages. Under the 
‘private information treatment,” potential customers were not explicitly informed about the 
level of the agent’s compensation, whereas under the “public i nformation treatment,” 
potential customers were informed about the details of the agent’s compensation. The 
information about the agent’s compensation (under the “public information treatment”) was 
provided at the end of the baseline survey, along with inf ormation about the products. The 
“private information treatment” group also received information about the products, but 
without any information about the agents’ compensation. Due to the limited sample size of 
the Midline Survey, the effects of the public -private information treatment are not analyzed 
in this report.  
According to the agent monitoring data collected by MCI during mentoring visits, agents 
reported a total of 544 problems in using the bank’s mobile website at the time of the first 
mentoring v isit, the most frequently reported of which were “unstable internet coverage” 
(125 reports), “cannot access LKD service upgrade” (106 reports) and “website slow when accessed by phone” (72 reports) (Table A- 2). However, the number of reported problems 
decreased by 44 percent by the third mentoring visit. Many agents also reported that they 
had not mastered several website functions at the time of the first mentoring visit (Table A -
3). However, such reports had decreased by 65 percent by the third mentoring visit. Agents 
reported several challenges in marketing the mobile banking products (Table A -4), including 
most frequently the absence of product branding, shortage of marketing materials (flyers and brochures), lack of customers’ familiarity with and trust  in the products, and preference for 
the products of another bank, with the number of reported challenges decreasing only by 15 
percent between the first and third mentoring visits. Agents reported a total of 259 customer 
complaints at the time of the firs t mentoring visit (Table A -5), including most frequently not 
having received a brochure and inability to upgrade LKD service, with the number of client complaints decreasing by only 14 percent between the first and third mentoring visits. 
Despite these obs tacles, agents reported steady increases in the number of clients and client 
transactions both for the LKD (digital wallet) and LP (basic savings account) products between the first and third mentoring visits, which were typically about two weeks apart 
(Table A- 6). Unfortunately, it is not possible to compare these reported outcomes to similar 
outcomes reported in the Midline Survey because the time periods are not comparable.  7 3.2 Demand -Side Interventions  
The demand -side interventions were targeted to wome n business owners in each trial village. 
Seven women business owners were randomly selected in each village from a list of all 
business owners operating in the village, four of whom were randomly assigned to receive 
training and follow -up mentoring from Me rcy Corps Indonesia (MCI) with the remaining 
three women business owners and five randomly selected male business owners not receiving any training or mentoring.
13 According to the MCI training manual, the training 
focused on personal financial management (tracking income and expenses, setting priorities, 
the importance of saving, financial planning), business financial management (basic 
bookkeeping, cash flow planning, record -keeping), and description of branchless banking 
products (LP and LKD). The initial training was conducted in village groups and lasted for about 3 hours (but ranging from 1 to 4 hours) and was followed up by three group 
mentoring sessions that focused on addressing any questions from the trainees and on actual 
practices using their own individual businesses as cases. Both the initial training and follow -
up mentoring sessions were well attended, with the initial training attended by 91 percent of the randomly selected sample women business owners and with 80 percent completing all 
three m entoring sessions. However, only 15 percent of women business owners completed 
their training and mentoring within 21 days of having completed their initial training, as 
planned, while 29 percent needed 43 or more days to complete it.
14 In addition, follow -up 
“reinforcement” calls were made in two phases (20 December 2017 -12 January 2018 and 17 
April -19 May 2018) by JPAL staff to all 12 of the randomly selected female and male 
business owners in each village (as well as to a randomly selected sub -sample of t he other 
female and male business owners who were identified in initial village listings of business 
owners).  The purpose of these calls was to remin d the business owners about the mobile 
financial services currently available in their villages, given that  the products were initially 
unavailable in many villages due to technical problems.  
4. Experimental Design and Random Assignment  
4.1 Experimental Design  
The main focus of the impact evaluation is on the effectiveness of the supply -side 
interventions, part icularly on the effects of high versus low agent incentives. The inclusion 
of the demand -side intervention was mainly to see whether the anticipated supply -side 
effects are increased in the presence of the demand -side training and mentoring of business 
owners. In order to preserve the maximum power to estimate the effects of the supply -side 
incentives, it was decided to nest the demand -side intervention within each village. In doing 
                                                      
13 In addition to the 1,554 randomly assigned women business owners actually trained, 1,228 additional women 
business owners were trained and mentored by MCI, none of whom were among those randomly assigned not to 
receive the training and mentoring (i.e., the controls).  
14 In the midline sample, only 3 percent of women business ow ners completed their training and mentoring 
within 21 days, while 41 percent needed 43 or more days.  
 8 so, it was recognized that there was a risk of spillover effects from femal e business owners 
sharing their knowledge with sample female business owners who did not receive the trial -
supplied training and mentoring.15 However, this risk was considered acceptable, particularly 
because interest in the demand -side intervention was sec ondary, and because possible 
spillover could be monitored by collecting additional data. In fact, the analysis of the midline 
data on business owners shows clearly the effects of the demand -side training and mentoring 
on various intermediate outcomes (e.g. , knowledge of mobile money, knowing the identity 
of the agent, initial take -up of the LP savings product), suggesting that any spillover effects 
of the training were small.  
Table 1 shows the random assignment of 400  agents to  one of four supply -side treat ment 
groups in a 2x2 design: (a) low vs. high incentive s, (b) public vs. private incentives .

Agents and female business owners were randomly assigned to their respective treatments prior to the corresponding baseline survey interviews in 23 steps as the agents were 
                                                      
15 According to the baseline survey data, almost 90 percent of the sample women business owners knew at least 
one of the seven other sample women business o wners, while almost 40 percent knew four or more. About 70 
percent of the women knowing one another reported that they saw each other at least once per month and about 
20 percent talked about their business when they met.  
 9 recruited.16 In the case of agents, the first step was to list the sample agents in strata defined 
on the basis of three criteria: (1) number of households in the village (based on 2011 
PODES data), (2) distance of the village from the nearest bank branch (based on 20 11 
PODES data), (3) and the number of agent competitors in the village.17 The agents were 
ranked within each stratum on the basis of the value of a random number generated for each 
agent from a uniform distribution (using Stata software) and were then assig ned to the 
treatment cells in the proportions indicated in Table 1 above. Similarly, the women business 
owners were listed by village and ranked within each village on the basis of a similarly 
generated random number and assigned to the treatment cells in the proportions indicated in 
Table 2 within each village. No adjustments were made to the original random assignments. 
The balance achieved in the random assignment of both agents and women business owners 
is evaluated and discussed in Section 6.1.  
5. Data  
Two sources of survey data are used in this report: (1) baseline and midline survey data for the 7 female and 5 male business owners in each sample village; and (2) baseline and midline survey data for the branchless banking agents in each sample vil lage.  
5.1 Baseline Survey Data  
Baseline data were collected for 4,828 business owners and 476 agents in a Baseline Survey 
that was conducted in two phases (during November 2016 -February 2017 in 107 villages and 
during July -November 2017 in 294 villages).
18 The Baseline Survey collected extensive data 
on both business owners and agents. The business owner data were collected in a single 
household questionnaire that required about 1.5 hours to administer and that included modules on (1) location, (2) basic ba ckground characteristics (e.g., age, sex, education, 
marital status, number of children), (3) mobile phone usage, (4) connections (if any) with the village bank agents, (5) knowledge about other villagers’ earnings, (6) trust in financial 
institutions, (7)  knowledge and use of mobile and other financial services, (8) savings and 
credit, (9) non -farm businesses owned, (10) other economic activities, (11) voluntary 
activities, (12) connections with the seven sample women business owners, (13) housing 
                                                      
16 The first six random assignments  of both agents and business women were done between November 3, 2016 
and January 3, 2017, prior to the corresponding interviews during the first phase of the baseline survey 
(November 2016 - February 2017), with the remaining 17 random assignments done bet ween April 25, 2017 and 
November 10, 2017, prior to the corresponding interviews during the second phase of the baseline survey (July-
November 2017).  
17 The actual strata were defined on the basis of the following three binary variables: (1) one if the dist ance of the 
agent’s village to the nearest bank branch exceeded the median value for nearby villages , and zero otherwise, (2) 
one if the number of households in the village exceeded the median value for nearby villages , and zero otherwise, 
and (3) one if t here were one or more competitors in the same village, and zero otherwise.  
18 The 476 surveyed agents included both “operating” and “registered” agents in the sample villages in which 
these functions were performed by different individuals. Only the “primar y” agents (those actually doing the 
work) were trained and mentored. The baseline agent and household survey also included one agent/village in 
which the agent refused to participate in the survey. In this case, the village was replaced by another village.  10 characteristics, (14) consumer durable ownership, (15) business assets, (16) intra -household 
decision -making, (17) business practices, (18) risk aversion and time preference, (19) 
potential demand for a mobile savings product, (20) perceptions and expectations about the 
product in their village, (21) feelings about the agent, (22) attitudes about inequality and 
financial disclosure, and (23) and cognitive skills.  
The sample means and standard deviations of baseline business owner characteristics both 
for the total  sample and separately by the business owners’ sex are presented in Table B -1 
(Annex B). These data indicate that there are very sharp gender differentials favoring male 
business owners in household headship, having a bank account registered in one’s name,  the 
number of paid workers in the primary business, number of customers in the primary business, average monthly profit in the primary business, total average monthly earnings from all sources, total value of business assets, total savings in the last 12 months, and in any 
money borrowed during the past 12 months. There are also smaller gender differentials 
favoring males in willingness to take risks, ownership of a smart phone, use of a phone to 
access the internet, any voluntary activities during the pas t year, registration of the primary 
business, and in having a second business. The only indicators in which there are 
differentials favoring female business owners are number of unpaid workers in the primary 
business, any savings during the past year, and whether another person is involved in deciding how to spend business earnings.
19 Characteristics in which gender differentials are 
quite small include highest completed level of schooling, cognitive ability, currently married, household size, knows bank’s mobile agent, trust in state -owned banks, safety of bank’s 
mobile savings product, reliability of bank’s mobile savings product, and spouse present in household.  
The baseline agent data were collected in a similar -sized agent questionnaire that also 
require d about 1.5 hours to administer and that included modules on (1) location, (2) basic 
background characteristics, (3) mobile phone usage, (4) work experience, (5) agent job 
expectations and perceptions, (6) attitudes about inequality and financial disclosur e, (7) 
prosocial motivation and identity, (8) knowledge about villagers’ earnings, (9) trust in 
financial institutions, (10) knowledge and use of mobile and other financial services, (11) 
savings and credit, (12) liquidity, (13) non -farm businesses owned, (14) other economic 
activities, (15) voluntary activities, (16) connections with other bank agents in nearby villages, (17) housing characteristics, (18) consumer durable ownership, (19) business assets, and (20) 
cognitive skills. The sample means and stan dard deviations both for the total sample and by 
the agent’s sex are presented in Table B -2. These data show that even among agents there 
are large gender differentials favoring male agents in business assets, business revenue, 
number of paid workers, number of customers, amount of idle money and amount saved 
during the past 12 months. There are also smaller gender differentials favoring males in the 
use of mobile phones for banking, number of minutes of mobile phone use per typical day, internet access at the workplace, ever applied for a loan, number of currently outstanding 
loans, and in any voluntary activities conducted during the past year. The only large 
                                                      
19 See Buvinic, Knowles and Witolear (2018) for more information on gender differentials in the baseline data on 
business owners.  11 differential favoring female agents in the baseline agent data is the percentage of female 
custome rs (56 percent versus 45 percent male). Agent characteristics in which gender 
differences are quite small include highest level of schooling completed, cognitive ability, currently married, household size, owns smart phone, uses phone to access the interne t, has 
store, expected performance in agent job, safety of bank’s mobile savings product, reliability of bank’s mobile savings product, preference for female boss, agent sees self as caring, any saving during past 12 months, has second business, number of hours worked in primary 
business on typical day, and number of unpaid workers in primary business in typical month.  
5.2 Midline Survey Data  
The Midline Survey was conducted in 200 villages of Ngawi, Tuban and Bojonegoro districts 
in February 2018 in which the training and mentoring of agents and business owners and 
follow -up “reinforcement” calls had been completed. Data were collected for 2,319 business 
owners (1,344 females and 975 males) and for 215 agents from 189 of the 200 sample 
villages.
20 The target  was to interview 2,399 business owners and 231 agents who had been 
interviewed in the Baseline Survey, but 93 business owners and 16 agents could not be re -
interviewed for various reasons (sample attrition), including relocation, temporary absence, 
illnes s or persistent refusal to be re -interviewed. The characteristics of those not able to be 
re-interviewed are analyzed in Section 6.2.  
Both the agent and household questionnaires used in the Midline Survey were significantly shorter than those used in the B aseline Survey, requiring only about one hour to administer. 
The midline agent questionnaire includes modules on (1) location, (2) detailed information about the job as agent (i.e., satisfaction, work activities and time use, job training and 
mentoring rec eived, job expectations, perceptions of the bank’s mobile savings product, 
number of customers, earnings from the agent job, motivation, trust in financial institutions), 
(3) prosocial motivation and identity, (4) trust in financial institutions, (5) volun tary activities, 
(6) risk taking and time preference, (7) personality traits, and (8) logical skills. The midline 
survey data on the branchless banking agents are analyzed in Section 7.1.  
The midline household questionnaire administered to business owners includes modules on (1) location, (2) identification (age and ID card number), (3) mobile phone usage, (4) use of 
mobile and other financial services, (5) connections with the agent, (6) trust in financial institutions, (7) savings and credit, (8) non -farm businesses owned, (9) household income, 
(10) ownership of consumer durables, (11) business assets, (12) household decision making, (13) willingness to pay for the bank’s mobile savings product, (14) perceptions and 
expectations about the bank’s mobile sav ings product, (15) feelings about the agent, (16) 
subjective well -being, (17) assertiveness, and (18) persistence. The midline survey data on 
business owners are analyzed in Section 7.2.  
 
                                                      
20 26 of the surveyed agents were “secondary” agents. See footnote 18.  12 6. Balance and Sample Attrition  
6.1 Balance  
Balance was assessed by simple linear regressions of the baseline values of large numbers of 
covariates for both business owners and agents on the randomly assigned treatments. The 
balance tests are done both for the random assignment of the total baseline sample and 
separately f or the villages included in the midline sample and for the villages not included in 
the midline sample (i.e., the non -midline sample). Table B -3 reports the results of balance 
tests for the random assignment of female business owners to the training and me ntoring 
treatment (columns 1 -3) and to the high agent incentive treatment (columns 4 -6). The 
overall results of the balance tests, based on the binomial distribution, are reported in the bottom rows of the table. They indicate that the numbers of statistic ally significant 
coefficients, both at the 0.05 and 0.01 levels, are not inconsistent with a null hypothesis that 
the coefficients are equal to zero at conventional levels of significance. Table B -4 reports the 
results of similar balance tests for the rand om assignment of agents to the high incentive 
treatment. The results indicate that the number of statistically significant coefficients are 
inconsistent with a null hypothesis that the coefficients are equal to zero in two cases: (1) for 
the total sample a t the 0.05 level (p=0.026) in column 1 and (2) for the non -midline sample 
at the 0.05 level (p=0.008) in column 3. Accordingly, the regression models used in the 
analysis of agents reported in section 7.1 include baseline covariates to help control for 
possible bias in the random assignment of agents.   
6.2 Sample Attrition  
There was some sample attrition between the baseline and midline surveys in both the data 
on business owners and the data on agents, i.e., 93 of 2,399 business owners in the midline 
samp le (3.88 percent) could not be re -interviewed in the Midline Survey, while 16 of 230 
baseline agents in the midline sample (6.96 percent) could not be re -interviewed. Although 
such levels of attrition are relatively low, they nevertheless raise the possibility that the Midline Survey data might be a biased sub -sample of the Baseline Survey. This problem is 
potentially most serious with respect to the randomly assigned treatment variables because random assignment is used to control for both observed and unobserved variables.  
Tables B -5 and B -6 report both simple regressions of an indicator of attrition (equal to one if 
the baseline observation was not re -surveyed in the midline, 0 otherwise) on dichotomous 
variables representing each of the randomized treat ments (unadjusted models) and adjusted 
models including a broad range of covariates. The results indicate that there is no evidence 
of selective attrition with respect to the randomized treatment variable in either the 
unadjusted or adjusted models. There is also no evidence that agent attrition is related to any 
of the covariates, i.e., the single statistically significant covariate in the adjusted model 
reported in Table B -6 (the agent has a shop) could easily have occurred purely by chance 
(p=0.283, base d on the binomial distribution). However, the three statistically significant 
covariates in the adjusted model for the female training and mentoring treatment (column 2 of Table B -5) and the two statistically significant covariates in the adjusted model fo r the 13 high agent incentives treatment (column 4 of Table B -5), both of which are significant at the 
0.01 level, imply rejection of the null hypothesis that there is no attrition bias. Moreover, one 
of the covariates (the business owner knows the bank’s mobile agent) is significant at the 
0.01 level in both columns 2 and 4 and is theoretically reasonable (i.e., business owners who 
know their agent are less likely to attrit). Accordingly, the regression models used in the 
analysis of business owners reported in section 7.2 include a rich set of baseline covariates (including the baseline values of the dependent variables when available) to control for any 
bias due to sample attrition.   
7. Analysis  
7.1 Agent Data Analysis  
This sub -section of the report discuss es the analysis of midline survey data for 214 
branchless banking agents working in 189 villages of three districts (i.e., Ngawi, Bojonegoro 
and Tuban districts). The 214 agents include both “operating” and “registered” agents in the 
25 sample villages in which these functions were performed by different individuals.21 The 
data were collected as part of the Midline Survey conducted during February 2018 . All but 
one of the surveyed agents are among the 230 agents from 199 villages for whom baseline 
data were previously collected. However, 16 of the agents from 9 villages included in the baseline survey could not be re -interviewed at midline, as previously discussed (section 6.2). 
The sample means and standard deviations of the agent outcomes by treatment categ ory are 
presented in Table C -1 (Annex C). Several of the outcomes are winsorized (highest 2 percent 
of reported values) and/or transformed to inverse hyperbolic sine values, as indicated in the 
tables.   
Midline effects on agent outcomes are hypothesized to  result from the randomized 
treatment of high versus low agent incentives, i.e., randomly selected agents received higher 
incentives from enrolling new LP customers, with other agent fees (e.g., fees for processing 
customer withdrawals) the same for all ag ents. The following agent- level statistical model 
was estimated:  
y = β
0 + β 1T1 + β  2S + Σδjzj + ε       
 (1) 
where y refers to a given agent outcome (e.g., the number of training visits received), T 1 
indicates the randomized treatment of high agent incentives, S indicates a female agent, z  is a 
vector of up to six additional covariates (z =z1, z2,…z 6), ε is a random disturbance term and β  
and δ are vectors of fixed parameters.22 One covariate of special interest is the agent’s sex 
                                                      
21 Most of the “operating” agents (agn_no=”001”) are also  “registered” agents, whereas most of the “registered” 
agents (agn_no=”002”) are not also “operating” agents.  
22 If equation (1) included no covariates, the control value (T 1=0) would be equal to the intercept (β 0). However, 
with covariates (adjusted models ), the control value is estimated as the average of the predicted values of y with 
T1=0 and with the observed values of S and z . 14 (S). As part of the experimental design the participating bank agreed to make a special effort 
to recruit female agents, and indeed, 47 percent of the recruited agents are female (Table B -
2). The outcome s of agents may vary by sex, especially given the fact that special efforts were 
made to recruit female agents. However, it would be inappropriate to give such differences a 
causal interpretation, given that female participation was not randomized. The other 
covariates include: the agent is the operating agent  (z1), the agent’s age (z 2), the highest level 
of schooling completed by the agent (z 3), indicators that internet services are available in the 
village (z 4) and that the mobile signal in the village is  strong (z 5), and the baseline value of the 
dependent variable (z 6), when available.  
The model in equation (1) was estimated as a linear regression model for continuous or dichotomous outcomes, as a Poisson regression model for count outcomes (bounded at zero) or as an ordered logit model for ranked qualitative outcomes. Consistent estimates of 
the parameters of the linear regression models were obtained by applying OLS directly to 
equation (1), while consistent estimates of the parameters of the nonlinear  Poisson and 
ordered logit models were obtained using maximum likelihood estimation. All estimates are intention -to-treat estimates.  
Equation (1) is estimated and reported for a large number of agent outcomes that are 
grouped into the following categories:  (i) general agent outcomes (Table C -2), (ii) agent time 
use (Table C -3), (iii) agent training and mentoring (Table C -4), (iv) LP demand and 
utilization (Table C -5), (v) agent earnings (Table C -6), (vi) agents’ reasons for liking their 
agent jobs (Table C -7), (vii) agents’ perceptions of how they are viewed by other people 
(Table C -8), (viii) agents’ trust in financial institutions (Table C -9), and (ix) agents’ prosocial 
outcomes (Table C -10). In addition to the estimated control values, the tables in Annex  C 
report the estimated marginal effects ( δy/δx) of higher agent incentives and results of a test 
of the joint significance of the additional covariates (z ).
23 The tables C -2 to C -10 use a 
common format. The estimated control value of each outcome (the adju sted mean of the 
control group T 1=0) is presented in the second row of each table (following the unadjusted 
control group mean).24 The next row provides estimates of the average marginal effect of 
higher agent incentives (T 1=1). The average marginal effect is shown instead of the 
estimated parameter ( β1) because it is easier to interpret in the nonlinear Poisson and ordered 
logit models (the two are identical in the linear regression models).25 The next six rows 
(seven, if the baseline value of the dependent variable is available) present the estimated marginal effects of the covariates (S and z ). They are followed by the p -value of the joint test 
that the coefficients ( δ) of the additional covariates (z) are equal to zero. The last two rows 
                                                      
23 The estimated marginal effects are estimates of δ y/δx averaged over all observations (i.e., not estimates at the 
sample means) and are identical to the estimated coefficients in the linear regression models.  
24 The control value is estimated as the average predicted value of the outcome y with T 1 equal to z ero and using 
the actual values of the covariates (not their sample mean values).  
25 The estimated marginal effects of the ordered logit models refer to the estimated probability that a given 
observation is in the highest observed category of the dependent variable (e.g., 10 for a variable with observed 
values ranging from 1 to 10).  15 in the tables pres ent estimates of the unadjusted R -squared (or pseudo R -squared, in the case 
of the nonlinear models) and the number of observations used to estimate each model.  
Because there so many outcomes, it is useful to analyze summary indices of the outcomes in 
each category (the results for the individual outcomes are discussed below). For example, the 
category of general agent outcomes includes the following seven outcomes: number of 
months as agent, agent satisfaction (1 -10), whether the agent’s spouse helps the agent (0 -1), 
whether the agent visits households to promote LP (0 -1), likelihoods that the agent will quit 
in the next three months (1 -10) or in the next six months (1 -10), and whether the agents 
think their agent job helps their main business (0 -1). Use o f a summary index based on these 
seven outcomes increases statistical power to detect effects that go in the same direction (i.e., positive or negative). To make this possible, in this example, it is necessary to change the definition of outcomes 5 and 6 s o that they refer to the likelihoods that agents will remain  in 
their jobs rather than leaving them. Following Kling, Leibman and Katz (2007), the summary 
index used is the equally weighted mean z- score of each outcome (re -defined, as in the 
preceding exam ple, so that higher scores correspond to more beneficial outcomes). The z -
scores are calculated by subtracting the control group mean and dividing by the control 
group standard deviation, so that each component of the index has mean zero and standard 
devia tion of one for the control group.
26  
Table 3 shows the results of linear regressions of the z- score indices using the model in 
Equation (1). The results indicate that higher agent incentives do not have a significant effect 
on any of the agent outcomes. In a few cases, higher agent incentives have both positive and 
negative offsetting effects on the summary index. For example, in Table C -3, higher agent 
incentives have significant positive effects on the percentages of agents’ work time spent 
promoting LP in their shops (column 5) and assisting bank customers (column 7), but 
significant negative effects on the percentages of their work time spent promoting LP outside their shops (column 6) and doing other activities (column 8). Similarly offsetti ng 
positive and negative effects are also observed in Table C -4. Several of the additional 
covariates are also significant with some indices, particularly in the absence of baseline values of the dependent variable (for which they may be proxying).

Note: Estimated standard errors are in parentheses. The outcomes represented by the indices in columns 1 -9 are 
the outcomes in the corresponding annex tables  C-2 to C -10, with the outcomes in columns 5 and 6 of Table C -2 
re-defined to be positive and with the outcomes in columns 1, 3 and 4 of Table C -3, in column 4 of T able C -6, 
and in columns 2, 4, 6 and 8 omitted from the corresponding indices.  
Only 12 of the 65 estimated effects of T 1 in Tables C -2 to C -10 are statistically significant at 
the 0.10 level or higher. However, several of the insignificant effects are also  informative, as 
discussed below.  
General agent outcomes  
None of the estimated effects of agent incentives on general agent outcomes in Table C -2 is 
statistically significant at even the 0.10 level, including the effects on agent satisfaction with 
their jo b (column 2), on whether the spouse helps the agent (column 3), on whether the 
agent visits households to promote LP (column 4), on the agent’s reported likelihood of 
quitting in the next 3 or 6 months (columns 5 and 6), or on whether agents perceive that 
their agent jobs help to grow their main businesses (column 7). The fact that none of these agent outcomes were significantly affected by higher agent incentives is surprising.  
Agent time use  
One might expect higher agent incentives to have a positive eff ect on the time spent 
working as an agent and that the effects of higher incentives on the percentages of agent working time spent in different activities would reflect agents’ perceptions about which 
activities would be most effective in increasing their earnings. Although five of the eight 
estimated effects of agent incentives on agents’ time use outcomes are statistically significant (Table C -3), the estimated effect of higher incentives on agents’ hours worked as an agent is 
negative and statistically insignificant. The five statistically significant effects include offsetting positive and negative effects. Taken together, these results indicate that higher 
agent incentives did not affect the number of hours agents worked as agents but that higher 17 incent ives did significantly affect the allocation of their work time across various agent 
activities.  
The relationships between five of the eight outcomes and female agents are also statistically 
significant, including positive relationships with hours per day doing housework (column 4) 
and the percentages of agent work promoting the LP product outside the agent’s shop 
(column 6) and doing other agent work (column 8) and negative relationships with the 
number of hours per day spent doing other work (column 3) and the percentage of agent 
work time spent promoting the LP in the agent’s shop (column 5).  
Agent training and mentoring  
The training and mentoring was to be provided equally to all agents. However, the results in Table C -4 indicate that the estimated effe cts of higher incentives are statistically significant in 
three cases, i.e., positively in the case of whether the agents received any mentoring from their partner bank employers and whether the agent was visited by a bank supervisor (8.5 
percent and 8.6 p ercent more likely respectively but only significant at the 0.10 level in both 
cases) and negatively in the case of the number of mentoring visits received by the agent (1.6 
fewer visits on average compared to the estimated adjusted control value of 6.0 vi sits with 
T
1=0 and significant at the 0.01 level). The results also indicate that female agents received 
significantly more training visits, mentoring visits and bank supervisor visits, other factors 
equal (i.e., 0.8, 1.6 and 0.4 more on average respective ly, compared to estimated adjusted 
control values of 2.6, 6.0 and 2.3 visits respectively).27 In addition, the results indicate that 
the training and mentoring outcomes of operating agents are uniformly higher, as expected (and significantly so in 5 of 7 ca ses). 
LP demand and utilization 
It was expected that the demand for and utilization of the LP product would be positively 
related to higher agent incentives (i.e., that agents facing higher incentives would work 
harder to increase the demand for the LP pro duct). In fact, the results in Table C -5 indicate 
that the effect of higher incentives is significant (at only the 0.10 level) in only one case (i.e., 
the number of people opening and saving in LP accounts during the past month) and that 
the estimated effe ct is negative .
28 In particular, the estimated effect of higher incentives on the 
cumulative number of LP accounts opened is negative and statistically insignificant. Two of 
the six outcomes are significantly related to female agents, with one positive (the number of 
peopl e opening and savings in LP accounts in the past month) and one negative (the 
expected number of LP account openings in the next year). The results in Table C -5 also 
provide some evidence that the demand for and utilization of LP accounts are positively 
related to internet access and to the strength of mobile signals in villages.  
                                                      
27 The estimated relationships with female agents were also positive in the case of 3 of the 4 remaining training 
and mentoring outcomes.  
28 Five of the six estimated effects of higher agent incentives on the LP demand and utili zation outcomes are 
negative.  18 Agents’ earnings  
It was expected that agent earnings would be positively related to higher agent incentives. 
However, the results in Table C -6 indicate that only one of the estimated effects of higher 
agent incentives on agent earnings outcomes is statistically significant (the minimum monthly 
earnings that would satisfy the agent, with the estimated effect negative). Although the 
estimated effect of higher agent incentives on agent s’ monthly earnings is positive (column 
1), the estimated effect is quite small (+0.03 compared to the estimated adjusted control 
value of 2.72) and is not even marginally significant. The relationships between all four of 
the agent earnings outcomes and a gent’s sex (as well the agent’s age and education) are 
statistically insignificant.  
Agents’ reasons for liking their jobs  
One might expect that higher agent incentives would have a positive effect on some of the 
reasons agent give for liking their jobs (e. g., “ability to earn more money”). However, the 
results in Table C -7 indicate that agent incentives have no effect on the stated importance of 
any of these reasons. Similarly, none of these outcomes vary significantly with the agents’ 
sex. 
Agents’ percepti ons about how they are viewed by others  
One might expect that higher agent incentives would affect some of their perceptions of how they are viewed by others (e.g., “more motivated by money”). However, the results in 
Table C -8 indicate that agent incentives have no significant effects on any of these 
perceptions, nor are any of them significantly related to the agent’s sex.  
Agents’ trust in financial institutions  
One might expect that higher agent incentives might affect some aspects of agents’ tru st in 
financial institutions (e.g., “confidence that the agent’s bank is a good employer”). However, 
the results in Table C -9 indicate that higher agent incentives have no effect on any of these 
outcomes. However, one of the outcomes (i.e., “the agent’s pa rtner bank employer mainly 
aims to promote financial inclusion”) is significantly higher among female agents.  
Agents’ prosocial outcomes  
Expectations are that the effects of higher agent incentives on agents’ prosocial outcomes are likely to be negative. I ndeed, the results in Table C -10 indicate that 8 of the 9 estimated 
effects are negative, with two being statistically significant (i.e., agent sees self as caring at the 
0.10 level and the number of hours volunteered by agents in a typical month at the 0. 01 
level). The latter estimated effect is substantial in magnitude (i.e., - 3.3 hours compared to an 
estimated adjusted control value of 5.6 hours). The results also indicate that female agents 
are both significantly less likely to report any voluntary activity in the last year and to report 1.8 fewer hours volunteered in a typical month, other factors equal. Both internet availability 
and a strong mobile signal in an agent’s village are negatively and significantly related to the 
number of hours volunteered  in a typical month, whereas both education and age are 
positively related to the same outcome (as well as to the amount of money contributed).  19 7.3 Business owner data analysis  
This sub -section of the report discusses the analysis of midline survey data on  2,319 business 
owners (1,344 females and 975 males) from 200 villages. Midline effects are assumed to 
result from two separate randomized treatments (T 1 and T2), where T 1 is the village -level 
treatment providing higher incentives to agents in randomly sel ected villages and T 2 is the 
business -owner -level treatment providing training and mentoring to randomly selected 
women business owners in all sample villages. No male business owners received any training or mentoring, while all agents received training a nd mentoring. The following 
owner -level statistical model is used to estimate the trial’s midline effects:  
y = β
0 + β 1x1 + β 2x2+ β 3x3 + β 4x4 + β 5x5 + Σδjzj + ε     
 (2) 
where y refers to an owner outcome (e.g., whether a savings account was opened), z  is a 
vector of K covariates ( z=z1, z2,…z K), ε is a random disturbance term, β and δ are vectors of 
fixed parameters and x is a vector of six treatment categories defined in Table 4 below.  
Table 4 . Definition of treatment categories  
Treatment category  Sex T1 (higher  agent 
incentives)  T2 (business owner 
training and mentoring)  N 
x0 Female  0 0 300 
x1 Female  1 0 272 
x2 Female  0 1 411 
x3 Female  1 1 361 
x4 Male  0 0 514 
x5 Male  1 0 461 
Total     2,319  
 
The omitted category x 0 in Table 4 represents the control value of y for a female business 
owner residing in a village with low agent incentives and not receiving any training or 
mentoring (T 1=T 2=0).29 The remaining elements of β (β1, β2…, β5) are the marginal effects 
of the other treatment categories ( x= x1, x2,…x 5) relative to the control category ( x0). 
Hypotheses concerning T 1 and T 2 involve differences in the elements of β. For example, the 
hypothesis that the agent incentive treatment (T 1) has no effect is equivalent to the joint 
hypothesis (β 1 – β 0) = (β3 – β2) = (β5 – β 4) = 0, the hypothesis that the female business owner 
training and mentoring treatment (T 2) has no effect is equivalent to the joint hypothesis (β 2 – 
β0) = (β3 – β 1) = 0, the hypothesis that there is no interactive effect between T 1 and T 2 is 
equivalent to the hypothesis ( β3 – β 2)=0, while the hypothesis that the effect of agent 
incentives (T 1) does not differ between female and male business owners is equivalent to the 
joint hypothesis that (β 1 – β 0) = (β3 – β 2) = (β5 – β 4). 
                                                      
29 If equation (3) included no covariates, the control value  would be equal to the intercept. However, with 
covariates specified (adjusted estimates), the adjusted control value is estimated as the average of the predicted 
values with x 1 ,  x2, …,  x5=0 and with the observed values of z . 
 20 The model in equation (2) is estimated as a linear regression model for continuous or 
dichotomous dependent variables, as a Poisson regression model for count dependent 
variables (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3,…)30 and as an ordered logit model for dependent variables with 
ordered qualitative responses. OLS is used to estimate the parameters of the linear regression 
models, while maximum likelihood estimation is used to estimate the parameters of the 
nonlinear Poisson and ordered logit models. The covariates include the baseline value of the dependent variable (or a close substitute) when available as well as baseline values of 
business owner characteristics.
31 The sample means and standard deviations of the outcomes 
by treatment category are presented in Table D -1 (Annex D). Several of the outcomes are 
winsorized (including their corresponding baseline values) and in some cases transformed to 
inverse hyperbolic sine values, as indicated in the tables. All estimates are intention -to-treat 
estimates. The estimated standard error s are adjusted for clustering at the village level, 
reflecting the village -level treatment of agent incentives.  
The estimation results for multiple outcomes (grouped into broad categories) are presented 
in Tables D -2 to D -15. The tables use a common forma t. The estimated control value of 
each outcome (the adjusted mean for the control group x 0) is presented in the second row of 
each table (following the unadjusted control group mean).32 The next five rows provide 
estimates of the average marginal effects of  the five treatment categories (x 1 ─ x 5) relative to 
the estimated control value (x 0). The average marginal effects are shown instead of the 
estimated parameters ( β) because they are easier to interpret than the estimated parameters in 
the case of the nonl inear Poisson and ordered logit models (the two are identical in the linear 
regression models).33 The next four rows of the table present the results of the hypotheses 
tests described above. The last two rows in the tables present estimates of the unadjuste d R-
squared (or pseudo R -squared, in the case of the nonlinear models) and the number of 
observations used to estimate each model. The estimated marginal effects of the covariates 
are not reported in tables D- 2 to D -15 due to their large number.  
As in sect ion 7.2, there are multiple outcomes in each broad category. Summary indices of 
the outcomes in each category (i.e., average z- scores) are therefore analyzed before 
discussing the results for individual outcomes. Table 5 shows the results of linear regress ions 
of the z -score indices of business owner outcomes using the model in Equation (2). In this 
                                                      
30 Poisson regression models, which are robust for bounded dependent variables, are also estimated in the case of 
a few continuous dependent variables that are bounded (e.g., the percentage of spouse earnings that are not 
known to the entrepreneur).  
31 The baseline values of near substitutes for the dependent variable are used in a few cases when baseline values 
are not available (e.g., any amount borrowed during the past 12 months for amount borrow ed during the past 3 
months). The covariates include the baseline values of the entrepreneur’s age (7 categories), highest completed 
level of schooling (5 categories), number of the entrepreneur’s children residing in the household, the 
entrepreneur’s cognitive ability, willingness to take risk, indicators of whether the entrepreneur is married, is the 
head of the household, and resides in an urban area, household size, and the value of the household’s asset index.  
32 The adjusted control value is estimated as the average predicted value of the outcome y with T 1 and T 2 equal to 
zero and using the actual values of the covariates (not their sample mean values).  
33 The estimated marginal effects of the ordered logit models refer to the probability that a given ob servation is in 
the highest observed category of the dependent variable (e.g., 10 for a variable with values ranging from 1 to 10).  
 21 case, the 14 categories of outcomes are mapped into nine summary indices.34 The joint tests 
reported in Table 4 indicate that higher agent incentives (T 1) have a significant positive effect 
on three of the summary indices (i.e., household decision -making, saving and general 
welfare), two of which are limited to female business owners.35 Female business owner 
training and mentoring (T 2) has a significant positive ef fect on six of the summary outcomes 
(knowledge of MM, relationships with MM agents, household decision -making, spousal 
roles, saving and general welfare). These estimated positive effects are also relatively large 
compared to control values. In addition, t here are significant positive interaction effects 
between higher agent incentives (supply side) and female business owner training and mentoring (demand side) for two summary outcomes (household decision- making and 
saving), with four additional interaction  effects being positive, but not significant (columns 1, 
3, 5 and 9).

The results for individual outcomes are discussed for the following groups of related 
outcomes: (i) knowledge and use of mobil e money products, (ii) intra -household decision 
making and gender roles, (iii) business outcomes, (iv) saving and borrowing, and (v) indicators of general welfare. Estimates of the trial effects on 89 individual outcomes are 
presented. One general impressi on that emerges from the analysis of the individual 
outcomes is that the estimated effects of the demand -side treatments are more often 
statistically significant than are the estimated supply -side effects. Specifically, only 9 of 89 
estimated supply -side e ffects are statistically significant at the 0.10 level or higher, compared 
to 22 of 89 estimated demand -side effects. However, the results also indicate that several of 
the demand -side effects are stronger in the presence of high agent incentives.  
7.3.1 Kn owledge and Use of Mobile Money Products  
Table D -2 reports estimates of the effects of T
1 and T 2 on the following intermediate 
outcomes related to the knowledge and use of mobile money (MM): whether the business 
owner “knows about” (1) mobile money (0 -1), (2) digital wallet products (LKD, 0 -1), and (3) 
mobile saving products (LP, 0 -1), (4) whether a business owner who has not yet signed up 
for a mobile savings product cites “lack of information” as one reason (0 -1), and whether 
the business owners use their  mobile phones (5) to access the internet (0 -1), (6) for mobile 
money (0 -1), and (7) for banking (0 -1). The results in Table D -2 indicate that higher agent 
incentives had a marginally significant effect (positive) on only one of these outcomes: use of 
mobi le phone for banking. However, the results indicate that T 2 had a significant positive 
effect on most outcomes related to knowledge of mobile money (MM).36 For example, the 
results in Table D -2 (columns 1 -3) indicate that the training and mentoring of women 
business owners (T 2) had a highly significant positive effect on their knowledge of MM in 
general, and more specifically, of digital wallet (LKD) product s and mobile saving  (LP) 
products, suggesting that the training and mentoring of women business owners (T 2) was 
effective. Although the estimated effects are small, they are large relative to the adjusted control values. For example, a woman business owner  residing in a low (high) agent 
incentive village who received training and mentoring is 0.12 (0.16) more likely to report 
knowing about MM, 0.06 (0.05) more likely to know about digital wallet products, and 0.08 
(0.11) more likely to know about mobile sav ing products, other factors equal, compared to 
the adjusted control values of 0.08, 0.00 and 0.00 respectively. Although the estimated 
                                                      
36 An exception is that neither T 1 nor T 2 had a significant effect on “lack of informati on” as a reason cited for not 
signing up (a negative outcome). A relatively high percentage of respondents (43.6 percent) cited “lack of 
information” as one of the reasons that they did not sign up. The only reason more frequently cited (by 52.8 
percent of  respondents) was “lack of money to save.”  23 effects of T 2 are larger in combination with T 1 in columns 1, 3 and 6, these interaction 
effects are not statistically si gnificant.  
Table D -3 reports estimates of the effects of T 1 and T 2 on the following intermediate 
outcomes related to the business owner’s relationships with MM agents: (1) whether 
business owners know the agent’s name when asked (unprompted, 0 -1), (2) whe ther they 
know the agents when told their names (prompted, 0 -1), (3) whether the agents provided 
information on LP products (0 -1), (4) whether the business owner would be willing to lend 
money to the agent (0 -1), (5) whether a business owner who has not ye t signed up for a 
mobile savings product cites “lack of trust in agent” as one reason (0 -1), (6) the agent’s 
perceived level of effort in providing information about LP products (1 -10, with 10=”much 
effort”), and (7) the agent’s perceived competence (1 -10, with 10=”highly competent”). The 
results in Table D -3 indicate that higher agent incentives did not significantly affect any of 
these outcomes. However, the results indicate that T 2 had a significant positive effect on 
whether women business owners reported knowing the mobile money agent (columns 1 and 2) and whether the agent provided information on the mobile saving product (column 3). 
The estimated effects of T
2 on knowing the agent (unprompted) are large (x 2: +0.26; x 3: 
+0.29) compared to the adjusted control value of 0.29, while the estimated effects of whether the agent provided information on the mobile saving product (x
2: +0.06; x 3: +0.04) 
are also relatively large compared to the adjusted control value of 0.03.   
Table D -4 reports estimates of the effects of T 1 and T 2 on the following intermediate 
outcomes related to a business owner’s demand for MM products: (1) whether the business 
owner obtained MM services from the agent (0 -1), (2) whether a business owner who has 
not yet signed up for a mobile savings product cites “lack of trust in the bank” as one reason 
(0-1), (3) perceived popularity of the LP product (1 -10, with 10=”very popular”), (4) 
perceived safety of LP product (1 -10, with 10=”completely safe”), (5) perceived reliability of 
the LP prod uct (1 -10, with 10=”completely reliable”), (6) degree of confidence in state -
owned banks (1 -5, with 5=”extremely confident”), (7) degree of confidence in non -state-
owned banks (1 -5, with 5=”extremely confident”), and (8) perceived potential number of LP 
customers. The results in Table D -4 indicate that higher agent incentives (T 1) did not 
significantly affect any of these outcomes. However, the results indicate that the training and mentoring of female business owners (T
2) had a significant positive effect on whether a 
female business owner obtained MM services from the agent (column 1) and the degree of trust in state -owned banks by female business owners (column 6). However, the estimated 
effect of T
2 on actual use of MM agent services (column 1) is quite small (x 2: +0.02; x 3: 
+0.01), compared to the adjusted control value of 0.00. The estimated effect of T 2 on trust 
in state -owned banks is larger (x 2: +0.07; x 3: +0.09) but is significant at the 0.10 level. When 
business owners who had not yet used the agen t’s services were asked why they had not, the 
results in Table D -4 (column 2) indicate that neither T 1 nor T 2 had a significant effect on the 
frequency with which “lack of trust in the bank” was cited as a reason for not signing up.   
7.3.2 Intra -Household  Decision Making and Gender Roles  
Table D -5 reports estimates of the effects of T 1 and T 2 on the following outcomes related to 
the business owner’s role in making household decisions: (1) the business owner alone 24 decides whether to buy a new appliance (0 -1), (2) the business owner alone decides whether 
to work outside the home (0 -1), (3) the b usiness owner alone decides whether to support 
other family members (0 -1), (4) the business owner alone decides whether to save for the 
future (0 -1), and (5) the business owner alone decides whether to sign up for a new banking 
product (0 -1). The results i n Table D- 5 provide consistent evidence that both higher agent 
incentives (T 1) and the training and mentoring of female business owners (T 2) had a 
significant positive effect in combination on the likelihood that female business owners 
reported that they a re the sole decision -maker in several household decisions. In the case of 
the decision whether to work outside the home, for example, the estimated positive effect of training/mentoring combined with high agent incentives is equal to 31 percent of the 
adjusted control value.  
Table D -6 reports estimates of the effects of T
1 and T 2 on the following outcomes related to 
the roles of the business owner’s spouse: (1) percent of business earnings known to the spouse (0 -100), (2) percent of household expenses fina nced from the spouse’s earnings (0 -
100), (3) whether the spouse has income (0 -1), (4) whether the spouse has asked the business 
owner for money during the past 12 months (0 -1), (5) whether the business owner has sole 
control over her/his earnings (0 -1), (6 ) whether the business owner has sole control over the 
spending of some money (0 -1), and (7) whether the business owner and spouse have equal 
say over the spending of the spouse’s earnings (0 -1).
37 The results in Table D -6 indicate that 
T1 and T 2 had a posi tive effect in combination on whether a female business owner has sole 
control over her business earnings (column 5). In addition, the results indicate that the 
training and mentoring of female business owners (T 2) had a significant negative effect on 
the percentage of business earnings known to the spouse  (column 1) . What is most striking 
about the results in Table D -6, however, is the sharp gender differences in most outcomes, 
independent of the treatments (the exception is responses to the statement “Bus iness owner 
and spouse have equal say over spending of the spouse’s earnings”), even with the baseline values of these outcomes specified,
38 suggesting that most of these gender differences 
(although unrelated to T 1 or T 2) increased in magnitude between the  baseline and midline.  
7.3.3 Business Outcomes  
Table D -7 reports estimates of the effects of T 1 and T 2 on the following business outcomes: 
(1) whether the business owner has a second business (0 -1), (2) the number of unpaid 
workers in a typical month in the business owner’s primary and second business, (3) the number of paid workers in a typical month in the business owners’ primary and second 
business, (4) the total current value of the business owner’s business assets, (5) total average monthly reported profits in the last year in the business owner’s primary and second 
businesses, (6) total average monthly profits in the last year in the business owner’s primary 
and second businesses calculated from reported business revenue and itemized business 
expenses , and (7) total average monthly business revenue in the last year in the business 
                                                      
37 The outcomes related to the spouse (columns 1 -4, and column 7) are not reported if the entrepreneur has no 
spouse (N=232).  
38 All of the baseline values of the spousal roles outcomes were highly significant (p=0. 000, results not shown).  25 owner’s primary and second businesses. The joint tests reported in Table D -7 indicate that 
neither T 1 nor T 2 had a significant effect on any of the individual business outcom es among 
female business owners. However, the estimated effects of high agent incentives and training 
and mentoring of female business owners in combination are positive for the number of 
paid workers, total business assets, and total reported business pro fits (columns 3, 4 and 5). 
The positive estimated combined effect of T 1 and T 2 (+0.05 compared to an adjusted 
control value of 1.16) is marginally significant (p=0.111) for total reported business profits 
(column 5). The estimated effects of T 1 and T 2 on the number of unpaid workers are 
uniformly negative among female business owners. Sharp gender differences are again present in four of the outcomes (columns 2 -5) even after adjusting for baseline differences, 
suggesting that these gender differences i ncreased over time (although these increases were 
not significantly related to T
1 or T 2).  
7.3.4 Saving and Borrowing 
Table D -8 reports estimates of the effects of T 1 and T 2 on the following saving and 
borrowing outcomes: (1) any saving during the past 3 m onths (0 -1), (2) amount of total 
savings during the past 3 months (including zero savings), (3) ratio of savings in the past 3 
months to total average monthly profit during the past year, (4) total current savings balance, 
(5) any borrowing during the past 3 months (0 -1), (6) amount borrowed during the past 3 
months, and (7) amount of currently outstanding loans. The joint tests in Table D -8 indicate 
that T 1 had a marginally significant positive effect on the reporting of any saving during the 
past three mo nths (column 1). However, the positive estimated effect of T 1 is mainly present 
among male business owners (i.e., the estimated marginal effect of x 5 minus the estimated 
marginal effect of x 4), as indicated by rejection of the joint test for equality betwe en female 
and male business owners in the effect of T 1.  T1 and T 2 in combination had a large but only 
marginally significant positive effect on current savings balances (column 4), i.e., +0.25 compared to an adjusted control value of 2.13. It is also note worthy that the effects of T
2 on 
all four savings outcomes in Table D -8 are positive. Lastly, neither T 1 nor T 2 had any 
significant effects on any of the borrowing outcomes (columns 5 -7).  
Tables D -9 to D -11 report estimates of possible effects of the trea tments on saving by 
source (i.e., in formal bank accounts, in e -savings products, savings at home, savings in a 
ROSCA, savings in the form of real assets, or savings in other forms).39 The results in Table 
D-9 (columns 1 and 2) indicate that both T 1 and T 2 had positive effects on any formal 
savings and on any e -savings for women during the past three months as well as on the 
corresponding savings indicators in Tables D- 10 and D -11. Although the estimated positive 
effects of T 2 on e -savings (column 2) are ind ividually statistically significant, they are not 
jointly significant at conventional levels (p=0.244). T 1 and T 2 in combination had a 
marginally significant negative effect on any savings in real assets (column 5), suggesting that 
                                                      
39 Other forms of savings include informal saving networks, BMTs (Islamic financial institution), saving with 
other household members and all other forms of saving.  26 at least some of the red uction in any women’s savings in real assets may have been re -
channeled into e -savings.  
The results in Tables D -10 and D -11 indicate that T 1 and T 2 in combination had a significant 
positive effect among female business owners on both the amount of savings  at home 
during the past 3 months (Table D- 10) and on the value of current savings balances at home 
(Table D -11).40 In addition, T 2 had a significant positive effect among female business 
owners both on the level of savings during the past 3 months in ROSCAs (Table D -10) and 
on the value of current savings balances in ROSCAs (Table D -11). In addition, the results in 
Table D -11 (column  2) indicate that T 1 and T 2 in combination had a significant positive 
effect on the value of women’s current e -savings balances.  
Tables D -12 to D -14 report estimates of possible effects of the treatments on borrowing by 
source (i.e., from a formal bank, fr om friends and family, from a cooperative, from a BMT, 
and from other sources).41 The results in Tables D -12 and D -13 (column 1) indicate that T 1 
had a significant positive effect on reported borrowing from a bank among female business 
owners. None of the other borrowing outcomes were significantly affected by either T 1 or 
T2.  
7.3.5 General Welfare  
Table D -15 presents estimates of the effects of T 1 and T 2 on the following outcomes of 
business owners’ general welfare: (1) whether they have a bank account in their name, (2) an 
index of their overall happiness (1 -5, with 5=”very happy”), (3) an index of satisfaction with 
their current jobs (1 -5, with 5=”very satisfied”), (4) an index of assertiveness (i.e., the sum of 
responses indicating degree of comfort whil e engaging in six potentially stressful activities, 
with the responses ranging from 1 to 5, with 5=”yes, very comfortable), (5) an index of positive attitudes (i.e., the sum of responses indicating degree of agreement with 10 
statements relating to traits of persistence, determination and organization, with the 
responses ranging in value from 1 to 5, with 5=”strongly agree”), (6) reported per capita total household income in the last month,
42 and (7) a household asset index.43 The results in 
Table D -15 indica te that both T 1 and T 2 had generally positive effects on all these outcomes 
among female business owners (19 of the 21 estimated effects are positive, including 11 that are statistically significant). T
1 and T 2 in combination had a statistically significan t estimated 
effect of +0.10 on job satisfaction (compared to an adjusted control values of 0.531) among female business owners (column 3). The positive effects of T
2 on the assertiveness index and 
                                                      
40 The results in both Tables D -10 and D -11 indicate that T 1 also had significant positive effects on both of these 
outcomes among male business owners.  
41 BMT’s are Islamic financial institutions. However, no information was collected on the composition of other 
sources of loans.  
42 In cases where the entrepreneur could not provide a single estimate of household income (N=154) but was 
able to provide a low and high estimate (N=37), household income was assumed to be the average of the two.  
43 The household asset index is the first principal component of the number  of 20 consumer durables owned by 
the household. The baseline household asset index is the first principal component of 0 -1 indicators of the 
ownership of the same 20 consumer durables and of housing characteristics (no data on housing characteristics 
were collected in the Midline Survey).  27 the positive attitude index among female business owners ar e also jointly significant 
(p=0.031 and p=0.025 respectively). T 1 and T 2 in combination had a statistically significant 
estimated positive effect on household total income per capita of +0.03 among female 
business owners (compared to an adjusted control va lue of 0.407). Lastly, both T 1 and T 2 
had strongly positive and highly significant effects on the household asset index (e.g., +0.24 in combination, compared to an adjusted control value of - 0.23 and a standard deviation of 
1.47).  
8. Discussion  
The task of  identifying and “fielding” 400 agents took far longer than expected. 
Consequently, more than half of the agents in the midline sample had been in their jobs for less than six months at the time of the Midline Survey. In addition, the monitoring reports 
from agent mentoring visits indicate that there were many technical and logistical problems 
involved in establishing branchless banking services in the sample villages (although the 
monitoring data also indicate that rapid progress was being made toward redu cing most of 
these problems). Though similarly delayed, the demand -side interventions were successfully 
implemented. Participation in the business owner training and mentoring was above 90 percent (with a completion rate of 80 percent). Analysis of the mid line data indicates that the 
demand -side treatment, particularly in combination with the supply -side treatment, positively 
and significantly affected key intermediate outcomes among female business owners, 
including knowledge of mobile money, knowledge of the participating bank’s mobile 
products, provision of product information by agents, knowledge of the identity of the 
mobile banking agent, use of mobile phones for banking, and initial uptake of the basic 
mobile savings account. Differences in these outc omes between those who received the 
demand -side treatment and those who did not (including male business owners) are quite 
sharp, suggesting that possible spillover effects between women business owners who 
received training/mentoring and those who did not receive it were not present at midline.  
The report also finds evidence that both the demand -side and supply -side treatments, 
particularly in combination, had a uniformly positive estimated effect on total savings for 
women that was largest and statistica lly significant (+0.25, compared to an adjusted control 
value of 2.13) in the case of the total current savings balance. The report also finds 
consistent evidence of a positive and statistically significant effect of the demand - and 
supply -side treatments in combination on women’s e -savings. However, the estimated 
effects on e -savings are too small to account alone for the large estimated effect on the total 
current savings balance. Instead, the results suggest that women business owners increased 
their sav ings mainly in formal savings accounts, ROSCAs and real assets.  
The report also finds consistent evidence of positive effects of both demand -side and 
supply -side treatments, particularly in combination, on female empowerment. For example, 
the results show consistently positive and significant effects of the demand -side and supply -
side treatments in combination on the likelihood that a female business owner is the sole decision maker in decisions about work outside the home, whether to support other family 
members, whether to save for the future or whether to sign up for  a new banking product. 
The analysis also finds significant positive effects of the demand -side treatment on women 28 business owner’s self -confidence, as measured by indices of women business owners’ 
assertiveness and positive attitudes.  
Further downstream, the report finds evidence of significant positive effects of the demand - 
and supply -side treatments in combination on both women’s household total income per 
capita (+0.03 compared to an adjusted control value of 0.41 and a standard deviation of 
0.24) and more strongly on the household asset index (ranging from +0.20 to +0.24, 
compared to an adjusted control value of - 0.23 and a standard deviation of 1.47). Total 
household income is based on a single question and is therefore unlikely to yield reliable data  
in a predominantly rural setting.44 However, the household asset index is usually considered 
to be a robust measure of household welfare. The midline household asset index is the first 
principal component of the number of twenty different household durable s owned by the 
household.45 The data in Table 6 indicate that ownership of most items (shaded) follows a 
similar pattern among female business owners as the overall index in Table D- 15 (column 7).

44 No baseline value for total household income per capita is a vailable. The top 2 percent of values of the 
household income variable were winsorized and that the variable was converted to inverse hyperbolic sine values.  
45 The household asset index was also winsorized (top and bottom 2 percent of values). In addition , the baseline 
value was based on several additional housing characteristics for which data were not collected in the Midline 
Survey.  
 29 These results could be explained by a causal chain running from the treatments (i.e., training 
and mentoring of female business owners and higher agent incentives) to incre ased 
knowledge and improved business practices among female business owners and to improved performance of MM agents, leading in turn to increased saving and profitability of the 
female- owned businesses and ultimately to enhanced female empowerment and inc reased 
household incomes and assets. However, the analysis finds only weak support for a positive 
effect of the treatments on the profitability of female -owned businesses.
46 Although the 
combined effects of the training and mentoring and higher agent incentives had modest 
positive effects on the number of paid workers, the total value of business assets and 
reported profits, the estimated effects are not statistically significant. However, a direct 
causal link between increased saving and household assets, r ather than an indirect effect 
mediated by increased business profits, may explain the strong positive effect of the 
treatments on women’s household assets. Many sample business owners report that they 
accumulate household assets as a way of saving for emer gencies.47 The increased savings 
resulting from the treatments may have enabled some households to avoid having to sell assets to meet emergencies. The changes in female empowerment may also be directly linked 
to the reported increases in saving.  
It is tem pting to conclude that the reinforcing role of the supply -side treatments in these 
results was due to agents being motivated to target traditionally under -served female clients 
with more information and attention. However, the evidence in support of this 
interpretation is mixed. Although women business owners receiving training/mentoring 
were more likely to know about mobile money and the two mobile money products (LKD and LP) in villages with high agent incentives (Table D -2, columns 1 -3), they did not rep ort a 
higher perceived level of effort by agents to provide information about LP (Table D- 3, 
column 6). Agents themselves receiving higher incentives were not more likely to report that they visited households to promote LP (Table C -2, column 4), that they  worked more hours 
per day as agents (Table C -3, column 2), that their customers had opened more LP accounts 
either in total or during the past month (Table C -5, columns 2 and 4) or even that their 
earnings as agents were higher (Table C -6, column 1). Howe ver, many of the agents 
surveyed at midline had only been in their jobs for a few months and faced numerous 
technical and logistical problems initially with the branchless banking services.  
9. Conclusions  
At the time the Midline Survey data on which this report is based were collected both the 
supply -side and demand- side treatments had only recently been completed in many of the 
villages included in the midline sample, and the process of resolving technical and logistical 
constraints on the supply side was  still a work in progress. Moreover, uptake of a new 
                                                      
46 Unfortunately, no data were collected on business practices in the Midline Survey, so no evidence is available 
on the ef fects of the treatments on this important intermediate outcome.  
47 Thirteen percent of respondents in the Baseline Survey cited “acquiring assets for sale” as a primary way of 
saving for emergencies, exceeded only by “using a hiding place at home” (26 perce nt) and by saving in a “formal 
bank account” (17 percent).  30 product such as mobile banking in a rural setting would be expected to require some time. 
Accordingly, it is appropriate to view the findings in this report as preliminary.  
Subject to this qualification,  the analysis and monitoring data indicate that the demand -side 
interventions were effectively implemented and that, though nested within villages, there is 
no evidence at midline of a spillover effect from women business owners who were treated 
to those i n the same village who were not. The analysis of the business owner data finds 
consistent evidence of short -term effects on key intermediate outcomes, particularly when 
demand -side treatments (training/mentoring of women business owners) were combined 
with supply -side treatments (high agent incentives). The analysis also finds consistent 
evidence of the combined positive effects of demand and supply -side treatments on business 
owners’ reported savings, on female empowerment in household decision making and in measures of self -confidence, and on household asset ownership. Although the report finds 
only weak evidence of positive effects of the treatments on key business outcomes, including 
the number of paid workers, the total value of business assets, total business profits and total 
business revenue, the strong downstream effects on female empowerment and household 
assets may be directly linked to the observed increases in savings. However, the mechanisms 
by which these effects were produced as well as whethe r or not they are likely to endure over 
time is unclear at this time and can only be more thoroughly understood after the planned 
endline data have been analyzed.  
One important issue which this report does not address is the trial’s external validity. Firs t, 
the considerable time and resources required to recruit the agents and to develop the 
necessary bank support systems suggests that the treatments, even if found to be ultimately 
effective, could not be easily rolled out on a broader scale. Second, the v illages participating 
in the trial were not randomly selected. The trial villages are instead those in which it was 
possible, after considerable effort, to identify agents meeting the bank’s criteria as well as 
some special criteria imposed by the impact e valuation (e.g., that to the extent possible, the 
village should not have any competing branchless banking agents). Under these circumstances, it might be problematic to infer from this trial the likely effects of a rollout of the same interventions to a r epresentative sample of rural Indonesian villages.

The results in Table 5 (column 4) and Table D -5 (Annex D) indicate that higher agent incentives and the 
training and mentoring of women business owners (WBO) in combination had a consistently positiv e effect 
on whether the WBO indicated that she was the exclusive decision -maker in the following decisions:  
• Whether or not to buy an appliance for the home, such as a TV or microwave  
• In the way household members may work outside the home (in which jobs, how many hours, where, 
etc.) 
• Whether to support family members, such as her parents, siblings, or in- laws 
• Whether to save for the future  
• Whether to sign up for a new banking product  
This annex reports on further analysis to obtain answers to the following qu estions:  
1. How do the estimated effects in Table 5 and Table D- 5 vary if the WBO reports that instead of 
being the sole decision -maker, she reports that she is either the sole decision -maker or only 
“participates” in the decision along with her spouse or along with another household member?48 
2. How do the estimated effects in Table 5 and Table D- 5 vary if the sample is divided into two parts, 
one (n=1,025) with weakly empowered WBOs (i.e., those who identify themselves as other than the 
sole decision maker in  all five decisions ) and the second (n=1,291) with more strongly empowered 
WBOs (i.e., those who identify themselves as the sole decision -maker in one or more of the five 
decisions)?  
3. Are the answers to question #2 robust with respect to the choice of depen dent variable and statistical 
model, given the highly skewed distributions of the z -scores (Figure 1)?  
To answer the first question, Table E -1 presents results similar to those in Table 5 and Table D -5 for 
outcomes based on whether the WBO is either the sole decision -maker or only a participant in the decision . The 
results indicate that the pattern is similar, although the combined effect of higher agent incentives and WBO training and mentoring (x
3) is generally smaller, as evidenced by the estimated effec t on the z -score in column 
6 (e.g., +0.087, compared to +0.149 in Table 5). Accordingly, the remaining analysis in this annex focuses on the more sharply distinguished outcomes based on whether the WBO is the sole decision- maker, as in Table 
5 and Table D -5. 
Tables E -2 and E -3 address the second question. The results in Table E -2 are based on the sub -sample of 
WBOs that were weakly empowered at baseline, whereas the results in Table E -3 are based on the sub- sample 
of WBOs who were more strongly empowered at  baseline. The results indicate that the combined effects of 
higher agent incentives and WBO training and mentoring (x
3) are uniformly positive in both Tables E -2 and 
E-3. However, the estimated effects of x 3 are statistically significant for three of the five outcomes among 
weakly empowered WBOs. Not surprisingly, given the small differences in the estimated positive effects in relation to the estimated standard errors, the cross -equation tests of the hypothesis that the effect of x
3 is the 
                                                      
48 The remaining two choices are that the WBO’s spouse or another household member is the sole decision -maker.  78 same for both g roups of WBOs (reported at the bottom of Table E -3) cannot be rejected for any of the 
outcomes at conventional levels of significance.  
Table E- 4 presents estimates of the effects of the treatments on z -scores based on the responses for all five 
decisions for both groups of WBOs. To answer the third question, given the highly skewed distributions of 
the z- scores (Figure 1), the estimates are presented for the following four alternative z- score measures and/or 
statistical models: untransformed z -scores in a linear regression model (columns 1 and 5); an inverse 
hyperbolic sine (IHS) transformation of the z -scores in a linear regression model (columns 2 and 6), 
untransformed z -scores49 in a Poisson regression model (columns 3 and 7); and the change in the z -scores 
between the baseline and the midline in a linear regression model (columns 4 and 8).50 The results indicate 
that all four of these alternative statistical models lead to similar estimates of the marginal effects of x 3, i.e., all 
positive, with those for the weakly empowered group of WBOs (columns 1 -4) larger than those for the 
strongly empowered WBOs (columns 5 -8). The hypothesis that the effect of x 3 does not vary between the 
two groups of WBOs is rejected at the 0.05 level (p=0.025) only in the Poisson regression model applied to 
the untransformed z -scores (with the test reported in column 3 of the third from the bottom row of Table E -
4).

49 The Poisson regression model requires that all observations are non -negative. Accordi ngly, a constant is added to the estimated z -
scores so that their lowest value is zero. The z -score is used as the dependent variable in the Poisson regression model, rather than the 
count of sole decision -maker responses, in order to make the estimated ma rginal effects directly comparable across the models. The 
cross -equation test is unaffected by whether the dependent variable is the z -score or the count of sole decision -maker responses.
