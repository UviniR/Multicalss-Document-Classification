IN LEBANON AND JORDAN, HUMANITARIAN AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES 
have been working hard to manage the on-going humanitarian crisis stemming from the 
Syrian civil war. Cash and voucher assistance (CVA) have been central to government and 
humanitarian agency response efforts, resulting in two of the largest CVA programs in history. 
The value of CVA as a proportion of total humanitarian assistance in these two countries far 
surpasses the global figure of 10.3 percent at 30–38 percent ($400–500 million) in Lebanon 
and 28 percent ($252 million) in Jordan (CaLP 2018).1 
Furthermore, humanitarian agencies in both countries have made important investments to 
move away from in-kind assistance and to digitize CVA by using cards and biometrics to deliver 
cash and vouchers, which are maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of cash programs. 
These actions mirror the widespread global move toward cash-based assistance,2 as 
evidenced by commitments made during the High-Level Panel on Humanitarian Cash Transfers 
(2015) and at the World Humanitarian Summit (2016).3
Financial inclusion may help bridge the gap between cash transfers and  
long-term resilience.
Practitioners, donors, and governments recognize the benefits of cash assistance and 
are increasingly seeking to link cash transfer programs to a broader set of development 
interventions focused on building long-term resilience (CaLP 2018). Humanitarian crises, 
especially those that cause forced displacement, are becoming more frequent and protracted. 
At the same time, budgets for humanitarian programming, though increasing, remain 
insufficient to cover total funding needs with a 54 percent reported gap in funding needs in 
2019.4 Growing evidence on the role of financial services in humanitarian crises shows that 
households that have access to financial services, whether formal or informal, are more resilient 
against negative shocks than those that do not. Evidence also suggests that financial services 
help stimulate economic activity after a crisis.5 
1 Development Initiatives (2019) estimates that cash represents 16 percent of global aid. 
2 The Cash Learning Partnership (CaLP) defines “cash transfers” as “the provision of assistance in the form of money—
physical currency or electronic cash—to recipients (individuals, households, or communities).” Cash transfers do not 
come with any restriction on use and, in that sense, differ from restricted transfers that include vouchers, electronic 
vouchers, and in-kind assistance. Unlike in most financial inclusion literature, CaLP’s definition of “cash” includes digital 
transfers. For more, see “Glossary of Terms,” https://www.calpnetwork.org/learning-tools/glossary-of-terms/ .
3 The 2016 World Humanitarian Summit established the Grand Bargain—an agreement between some of the world’s 
largest donors and aid providers to get more means into the hands of people in need. See “Grand Bargain,” Agenda for 
Humanity, https://interagencystandingcommittee.org/grand-bargain .

HUMANITARIAN CASH TRANSFERS AND  FINANCIAL INCLUSION
The lack of fin ancial inclusion is due to the fac t that CVA progra ms do not lin k transfers 
to an account. CVA recipients o ften do not have financial accounts  or accounts under 
their name.
Case studies from Lebanon and Jordan test how cash  transfers could lead to such long-term 
resilience, looking specifically  at financial account ownership, account use, and a broad array 
of financial se rvices, i ncluding s avings, i nsurance, a nd credit t o support e conomic a ctivity a nd 
resistance to shocks. Howeve r, data collected through field visits and interviews over 2018–2019 
found that, despite the size and level of digitization, cash transfer programs in Lebanon and 
Jordan have n ot led to financial i nclusion several y ears after the humanitarian r esponse t o the 
Syrian crisis. This is important  for building  a financial history.  In addition, when credit or insurance 
was available, it was not connected to cash transfer programs.
The cases of Jordan and Lebanon highlight some of the key challenges governments, 
humanitarian agencies, and financial sector actors face in linking cash transfers to financial 
inclusion more broadly. These two countries have some of the largest, and likely most digital, 
humanitarian cash and voucher programs in history and more robust payments infrastructures 
than many other conflict-affected countries. They also have made considerable progress in 
digitization and collaboration  among h umanitarian a gencies a nd the government. H oweve r, 
financial inclusion is not yet a reality for refugees and vulnerable host communities who receive 
cash  assistance. 
The audience f or this paper i ncludes go vernments, fi nancial s ector r egulators, fi nancial 
institutions, and humanitarian agencies on the front lines of crisis response. This paper delves 
into these issues and examines why the potential pathway to financial inclusion has not yet 
materialized in Jordan and Lebanon, outlines models for strengthening links between CVA and 
financial inclusion, and addresses how efficient and effective CVA programs could be created.
Key F indings
1.A n enabling environment for digital financial services (DFS) is a critical factor in
connecting CVA to financial inclusion.6
•First, a country’s regulatory framework should enable widespread use of DFS.
Ideally, the regulatory framework supports financial inclusion, permits nonbank e-money
issuance, allows use of third-party agents, encourages risk-based customer due
diligence (CDD), and establishes consumer protection rules (Staschen and Meagher
2018). While such provisions are in place in Jordan, it is not the case in Lebanon, whereregulations limit the role of nonbanks in the financial sector by specifying that transactionaccounts may be offered only by banks. Hence, DFS through nonbanks do not exist inLebanon today.
6 See, e.g., Staschen and Meagher (2018).3
ExEcutiv E Summ Ary• Second, there is robust global evidence that an adequate core national payments 
infrastructure  is the foundation for large-scale CVA delivery and subsequent financial 
inclusion.7 A well-established core payments infrastructure allows CVA providers to 
leverage the financial system and distribution networks that already are in place. If the 
distribution network is weak, CVA programs can bring financial services access points 
to areas where recipients live. This can lead to continued access to financial services 
even after the program ends.
• Overall, Jordan and Lebanon have made considerable progress in leveraging 
infrastructure and technology to digitize cash transfers. Although they have yet to 
achieve financial inclusion, their efforts have built awareness, use, and trust in 
digital payments . Recipients gain awareness and trust from interacting with digital 
infrastructure, such as automated teller machines or point-of-sale devices.
• Yet, infrastructure is just part of the answer. To reach financial inclusion, recipients need 
to go beyond payment and cash-out transactions and use fully functional accounts. 
Interviews and market research suggest several other factors affect the ability to 
build financial inclusion through CVA programs, including  (i) leadership, resource 
mobilization, and clear prioritization by key decision makers and (ii) support 
to develop the market and build the business case for financial services 
providers (FSPs).
2. Based on global best practices and the experiences of Jordan and Lebanon, we have 
identified the following factors that are critical to connecting CVA to financial inclusion and 
long-term resilience:
• Donors and governments must make financial inclusion a priority.  They need 
to provide adequate financial and technical resources to support innovation. Through 
development programs and smart subsidies, donors and governments can promote 
piloting and programs to link digital CVA and financial inclusion. They also need to 
invest in new skills training for the humanitarian assistance community—as it is, only 
40 percent of organizations involved in humanitarian assistance have the capacity to 
implement CVA programs (CALP 2018).
• FSPs must be willing to have a direct relationship with cash transfer 
recipients,  who often are the poorest and most vulnerable people and who do not use 
formal financial services. Currently, most cash transfers are channeled through banks, 
which otherwise limit their outreach to low-income people because many believe that 
there is no business case in directly servicing these segments. The FSP revenue model 
thus mostly relies on fees for processing large humanitarian transfers. FSPs usually are 
contracted through a tendering process that often rewards the lowest bidder. FSPs 
that use this model do not see cash transfer recipients as potential clients who have an 
array of financial needs. Development finance institutions can play an important role in 
7 According to the Bank of International Settlements and the World Bank, the overall national payments system is the 
foundation of a country’s financial system and comprises all institutions, information, technologies, payment instruments, 
rules, and standards that enable exchange of monetary value. Key elements of a payments infrastructure can include 
automated clearing houses, large-value interbank settlement systems, and platforms for person-to-person transfers.4
HUMANITARIAN CASH TRANSFERS AND  FINANCIAL INCLUSION
changing this perception by providing FSPs with targeted subsidies that support them 
as they gain a better understanding of and build relationships with CVA recipients. In 
time, these recipients may earn enough to become sustainable customers.
3. Interagency collaboration among humanitarian agencies  and coordination with 
national social safety net systems  that run efficient and effective CVA programs are 
important to building pathways to financial inclusion and resilience. To achieve financial 
inclusion through CVA, we recommend that stakeholders, including FSPs, humanitarian 
agencies, donors, and governments, do the following:
• Advocate  for financial inclusion and resilience to the organizations’ senior leadership so 
that they understand the evidence behind financial inclusion and explicitly incorporate it 
as an objective funding consideration for humanitarian assistance.
• Ensure that regulation and infrastructure, key enablers of digital payments 
and financial inclusion, are in place:  allow e-money issuance, allow the use of third-
party agents, establish consumer protection frameworks, introduce risk-based CDD 
requirements, and build the digital payment rails. These enablers help to keep cost of 
compliance in check and make it easier to onboard new customers.
• Increase piloting and experimentation  to develop new financial products and 
distribution channels and to increase trust among stakeholders through opportunities 
to learn, adapt, and scale. Humanitarian agencies and FSPs need donors’ financial and 
technical resources to enable them to pilot and experiment. 
• Support a dynamic market for CVA and other financial services  by advising FSPs 
on business strategy and segmentation, providing smart subsidies and financing tools 
to mitigate potential risks, and piloting innovative approaches to CDD. These elements 
can make FSPs more willing to serve low-income individuals by lowering the costs of 
onboarding and monitoring for suspicious transactions (Lyman et al. 2018).
• Look to global standard-setting bodies  for technical guidance for regulators and 
FSPs on financial integrity standards and policies related to CDD and identification 
requirements. These standard-setting bodies, including the Financial Action Task Force, 
provide a regulatory architecture that can guide the financial sector’s response to forced 
displacement and balance financial integrity and stability priorities.5

THE SYRIAN REFUGEE 
CRISIS, DIGITAL CASH 
TRANSFERS, AND   
FINANCIAL INCLUSION
OVER 200 MILLION PEOPLE NEED HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE 
because of conflicts or disasters, and this number is growing (Development Initiatives 
2018). From the civil war in Syria to the exoduses from Myanmar and Venezuela to the 
famine in Yemen, global humanitarian crises persist. Indeed, the United Nations Secretary-
General in 2016 h ad already declared the situation to be unprecedented in terms of number 
of people affected. To quickly and decisively address these growing humanitarian needs, the 
international community has committed to increase the level of aid and improve its efficiency 
and effectiveness.
Cash and voucher assistance (CVA) has played a central role in the response to the Syrian 
refugee crisis and, starting in 2014, has been the primary aid delivery mechanism. (See Box 
1 for a definition of cash transfers.) Subsequently, there has been a global shift to prioritize 
the use of cash in humanitarian crises. This led the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) to 
convene the 2015 High-Level Panel on Humanitarian Cash Transfers. In addition, the Grand 
Bargain—an agreement between the world’s largest donors and aid providers—was launched 
at the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit.8 
CVA has grown 40 percent from 2015 to 2016, peaking at US$2.8 billion globally and 
representing 10 percent of humanitarian funding (CaLP 2018).9 Today, it is “widely recognized 
8 The Grand Bargain is an agreement between more than 30 of the world’s largest donors and aid providers who have 
committed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of humanitarian action. It comprises 10 commitments, including 
“Increase the use and coordination of cash-based programming.” See “Grand Bargain,” Agenda for Humanity, 2019, 
https://interagencystandingcommittee.org/grand-bargain.  
9 Statistics are available only for CVA, which includes both cash and vouchers. Estimates for 2018 put this figure at US$4.7 
billion or 16 percent of humanitarian funding (Development Initiatives 2019).6
HUMANITARIAN CASH TRANSFERS AND  FINANCIAL INCLUSION
as one of the most significant areas of innovation in humanitarian assistance, with huge 
potential to meet more needs, more efficiently and more effectively” (CaLP 2018). 
Cash transfers, as opposed to in-kind assistance or vouchers, can help meet the many 
immediate needs, including food, shelter, water, sanitation, and hygiene, of refugees and 
forcibly displaced people. A study in Ethiopia found that unrestricted cash was 25–30 percent 
more efficient than in-kind assistance, meaning that cash transfers lead to faster delivery, lower 
cost, and improved transparency (High-Level Panel on Humanitarian Cash Transfers 2015). The 
study also found that the viability of local markets and businesses grew. 
Cash also fosters recipient agency and choice: households can prioritize their needs and 
become empowered as they gain purchasing power. For example, a study in Iraq found that 
60–70 percent of households sold or traded in-kind aid to get cash to pay for more pressing 
needs (UNHCR and REACH 2014). In Jordan, cash assistance increased purchasing power 
by 15–20 percent over vouchers, enabling households to buy more food (Boston Consulting 
Group 2017). Cash transfers finance basic expenditures, particularly for displaced people who 
do not have access to public services. They can help households respond to shocks, and they 
have multiplier effects in a local economy.10 They are an important tool to promote resilience 
among refugees and forcibly displaced people.
As cash assistance grows, whether through humanitarian aid or government social safety nets, 
it is increasingly clear that it could lead to additional long-term benefits—in part because it is a 
critical link between the financial system 
and those traditionally excluded from it. In 
many cases, cash transfers are one of the 
few formal payment streams that reach 
households and individuals most affected 
by crisis. These households are most likely 
to have little to no access to formal financial 
accounts. A growing body of evidence 
shows that households that have access 
to financial services, whether formal or 
informal, are more resilient when faced 
with negative shocks and are better able 
to contribute to economic recovery after 
a crisis.11 Several humanitarian agencies 
and development actors recognized the 
potential for cash assistance to build 
pathways to financial inclusion and as a 
result drafted the 2016 Barcelona Principles 
on Digital Payments in Humanitarian 
Response (Tholstrup et al. 2017).
10 Researchers have calculated multiplier effects of up to 2.5 for vouchers and cash transfers, meaning that for every $100 
in cash assistance, $250 is generated in the local economy. See Kagin et al. (2014). 
11 See El-Zoghbi et al. (2017). BOX 1.   Cash transfers vs.  
cash and voucher assistance
According to the Cash Learning Partnership (CaLP), 
CVA refers to programs where cash transfers or 
vouchers for goods or services are directly provided 
to recipients, in either physical or digital form. In 
the context of humanitarian assistance, the term 
refers to providing cash transfers or vouchers to 
individuals, households, or community recipients, 
not to governments or other state actors. While 
unrestricted cash provides more opportunity 
for linking to financial services (as the recipient 
can choose to save or spend funds, unlike with 
vouchers), there are no disaggregated statistics 
for unrestricted cash versus vouchers. Thus, data 
used in this paper related to “CVA” include both 
cash and vouchers. For more, see the Glossary 
of Terminology for Cash and Voucher Assistance 
(http://www.cashlearning.org/resources/glossary ).7
thE Syri AN rEfug EE criSiS, Digit AL cASh t rANSf ErS, AND  fiNAN ciAL iNcLuSioN The Arab World has the lowest levels of financial inclusion globally—145 million adults do not 
have an account (Demirgüç-Kunt et al. 2018). The region is characterized by ongoing conflict 
and fragility, so linking cash transfers and financial services can be an important catalyst to 
reduce vulnerability and enhance the resilience of people affected by crisis. In Lebanon and 
Jordan, humanitarian and government agencies have exerted tremendous effort to manage 
the ongoing humanitarian crisis resulting from the Syrian civil war, which has displaced more 
than half of the Syrian population.12 The two countries’ experiences are particularly relevant for 
several reasons: 
• CVA programs are central to the response efforts in both countries. This is because markets 
in Lebanon and Jordan have well-developed financial infrastructures, including distribution 
networks for digital payments, such as automated teller machines (ATMs). People also 
are able to access goods in local markets. At the time this study was launched, CVA 
represented 10 percent of humanitarian assistance globally (CaLP 2018). In the same year, 
CVA in Lebanon was 30–38 percent of humanitarian assistance, and in Jordan it was more 
than 28 percent (Bailey and Harvey 2017; Sikander and Cuna Weaver 2017). In other words, 
CVA programs in the two countries are among the largest in history.
• Humanitarian agencies in Lebanon and Jordan have made significant strides in digitizing 
CVA, with widespread use of cards and biometrics to deliver cash and vouchers. 
• Agencies have pioneered models for interagency collaboration focused on CVA delivery and 
other functions in the CVA lifecycle. 
• Many humanitarian agencies in Lebanon and Jordan have begun to use unrestricted cash 
transfers, which, unlike vouchers, present opportunities for financial inclusion.
Against this backdrop, the World Bank Group and CGAP commissioned a comparative 
assessment of humanitarian and government CVA in Lebanon and Jordan. This paper explores 
the results of the assessment, how the links between cash transfers and financial inclusion can 
be strengthened when designing models for CVA delivery, and how implementing agencies—
government or humanitarian agencies responsible for the program—and financial services 
providers (FSPs) can maximize efficiency and effectiveness of such models. The paper then 
explores three building blocks for connecting cash transfers to financial inclusion: humanitarian 
and government prioritization of financial inclusion , enabling digital infrastructure and regulation, 
and a business case for FSPs. A fourth important building block, consumer demand, is not 
within the scope of this paper (see Box 2 on recipients’ preferences in digital cash transfers).
12 According to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), as of 2018, there were 13 million displaced Syrians—6.7 million 
refugees and 6.3 million internally displaced persons. The prewar Syrian population was 21 million according to the World 
Bank Development Indicators.8
HUMANITARIAN CASH TRANSFERS AND  FINANCIAL INCLUSION
SECTION 2
LINKING CASH TRANSFERS 
to FINANCIAL INCLUSION 
AND  RESILIENCE 
ALTHOUGH HUMANITARIAN AID IS UNLIKELY TO IMMEDIATELY LEAD 
to active use of financial accounts, humanitarian cash transfers  could lead to financial 
account ownership and subsequently to account use and access to a broader array of 
financial services, including savings, insurance, and credit. Evidence shows that these services 
can support resilience and create a pathway to financial inclusion (see Figure 1).
Creating the framework for this pathway begins with the operational and financial infrastructure. 
Strategic decisions are needed to ensure cash assistance enables financial inclusion through 
open-loop transaction accounts offered by local FSPs—rather than through new closed-loop 
systems to deliver aid.13 Tools and infrastructure that have survived a humanitarian crisis may 
include core telecommunications infrastructure, the national payment and settlement systems, 
an agent network facilitating digital payments, and government cash transfer systems such as 
social safety nets.
For cash transfers to lead to financial inclusion, a permissive regulatory environment needs 
to be in place—one that permits or at least does not preclude e-money issuance and digital 
transfers. In this environment, humanitarian and government agencies can select FSPs to 
disburse cash transfers through a transaction account in the recipients’ own name or allow 
recipients to choose which account should receive the disbursement. 
Cash transfer programs may be the incentives FSPs need to expand services and infrastructure 
to reach a large population that otherwise lacks access to financial services.14 As recipients use 
their transaction accounts not only to access cash transfer funds but also for other payment 
needs, they build a financial history, which opens doors to financial services beyond payments. 
Savings, insurance, and credit eventually can play a role in meeting the financial needs of crisis-
13 Recognizing that this may not be possible or appropriate in all humanitarian crises.

opportunities of the enabling environment, regulation, and market development.

SECTION 3
LEBANON AND  JORDAN: 
COUNTRY CONTEXT
LEBANON IS A SMALL OPEN ECONOMY OF HIGH MIDDLE-INCOME 
status with a resident population of 6.85 million people as of 2018.16 It is considered 
a fragile country because of its recent history of sectarian conflict (the 1975–1990 civil 
war) and more recently because of regional conflict and geopolitical tensions in neighboring 
countries. However, it has long been known for its human capital, strong educational institutions, 
a vibrant private sector comprising mainly small and medium-sized enterprises, and large 
diaspora community around the world that provides financial, economic, and cultural links.17
Traditional drivers of economic growth include real estate, construction, finance, and tourism, all 
of which have been affected in recent years by ongoing regional instability. Real gross domestic 
product (GDP) was estimated to have grown by only 0.2 percent in 2018, reflecting contractions 
in these key sectors and policy-based liquidity tightening from heightened macro-financial 
risks (fiscal and balance of payment deficits, historically funded through debt, leading to a high 
debt-to-GDP ratio).18 Before the large influx of refugees into Lebanon, the national poverty rate 
was 27 percent and was highly concentrated in the North and South and in dense pockets of 
certain urban areas. Unemployment (estimated at 25 percent) and the business climate remain 
key policy issues.19 According to the 2019 World Bank’s Doing Business Indicator, Lebanon 
ranks 142 of 190 economies and 15th among the 20 Middle East and North Africa countries in 
terms of ease of doing business.
The Kingdom of Jordan is a slightly larger country of nearly 10 million, as of 2018. While it 
has pursued structural reforms over the past 10 years in education, health, and the business 
environment (income tax, insolvency, regulation), a key challenge is reinvigorating its local 
economy in the context of a difficult external environment. Growth in GDP was estimated at  
2 percent in 2018, somewhat lower than in 2017, and is muted because of the unprecedented 
influx of refugees, disruption of trade routes (notably those with Iraq), and decreased

2017 and 2018).
Jordan heavily depends on external financing, including foreign savings, foreign direct 
investment, and remittances. Ongoing challenges include creating conditions needed to 
increase private investment and improving competition to create job opportunities, particularly 
given that 55 percent of the population is under 24 years of age and that overall labor force 
participation is relatively low at 28 percent. According to the 2020 World Bank’s Doing Business 
Indicator, Jordan ranks 75 out of 190 economies—29 ranks higher than in 2019. This is in part 
because it recently had implemented a unified legal framework for secured transactions and 
launched a collateral registry.
Lebanon and Jordan have been significantly impacted by the refugee crisis caused 
by the civil war in neighboring Syria. They rank the highest in the world by number of 
refugees per capita (UNHCR 2019). The rapid influx of refugees has strained their physical 
and social infrastructure, taking a toll not only on refugees themselves, but also on their host 
communities. Today, nearly one in every three people in Lebanon is a refugee. Similarly, 
Jordan has over 670,000 Syrian refugees, and while over 80 percent of them live outside of 
camps, just one camp, Zaatari, has become the equivalent of the fourth largest city in Jordan. 
Most refugees live below the poverty line in the two countries (see Table 1 ) (Verme 2016). 
Local economies are strained because of limited infrastructure and service access and an 
increase in supply of informal labor. This has placed great urgency on finding resilience-building 
interventions for both refugees and low-income host communities.
Lebanon and Jordan integrate humanitarian and development approaches to 
address the protracted humanitarian crisis.  Humanitarian agencies in these countries 
generally are supervised by each country’s ministry in charge of social affairs, with their 
corresponding central banks being informed on CVA operations. 
The Lebanon Crisis Response Plan, covering 2017 to 2020, is led by the Ministry of Social 
Affairs (MoSA) and focuses on humanitarian assistance to vulnerable communities while 
it seeks to expand investments, partnerships, and delivery models to transition to longer 
term development strategies. Similarly, the Jordan Response Plan (JRP) for the Syria Crisis 
(2018–2010) is led by the Ministry of International Planning and Cooperation (MoPIC). It aims to 
integrate a resilience approach that focuses on service delivery and infrastructure resilience.
CVA plays a key role in response efforts in both countries—even more so than in humanitarian 
assistance in other parts of the world, as described in Section 2 and illustrated in Figure 2 .20 
Lebanon and Jordan also use CVA in national-level social safety net programs for local 
vulnerable households. Lebanon’s social safety net is the National Poverty Targeting Program 
(NPTP). It was created in 2008 to provide health and education subsidies to the extreme poor. 
In 2015, it introduced food assistance to support Lebanese nationals using an approach like the 
one used for Syrian refugees. 
In Jordan, the National Aid Fund (NAF) provides vulnerable Jordanian households with

financial assistance for regular, emergency, and medical needs. Notably, NAF provides 
beneficiaries unrestricted cash, unlike Lebanon’s beneficiaries who receive only e-vouchers 
for food purchases. Nonetheless, using CVA in social safety nets presents the opportunity for 
governments to expand financial inclusion. 
In Lebanon, most vulnerable refugees receive CVA, for a total of US$400–500 million per 
year. While it is not possible to know the number of unique beneficiaries—households or 
individuals—the largest issuer, the World Food Program (WFP), reaches 140,000–190,000 
out of an estimated 240,000 refugee households. The households comprise primarily Syrians 
who are living below the poverty line. NPTP reaches just 10,000 Lebanese households with 
food e-vouchers for a total in CVA of US$17 million (3–4 percent of total CVA in the country).21 
Voucher recipients are selected among the poorest of the 43,000 households who receive 
education and health benefits (as in Annex A), themselves a small fraction of households living 
below the poverty line. In Jordan, vulnerable refugees and nationals receive similar coverage. 
21 NPTP recently was scaled up to 15,000 households.13

million—over half the population living below the poverty line.

SECTION 4
LESSONS LEARNED
A REVIEW OF THE CVA LANDSCAPE IN JORDAN AND LEBANON REVEALS 
the importance of collaboration and the increasing use of technology to improve scale, 
efficiency, and transparency of programs. This section provides an overview of CVA in 
Jordan and Lebanon programming, highlights the benefits of collaboration within CVA delivery, 
and discusses why CVA failed to create a pathway to financial inclusion.
4.1 Benefits of Collaboration
Humanitarian CVA in both countries required implementing agencies to closely 
coordinate and collaborate with each other. In Lebanon, humanitarian CVA is mainly 
implemented through Lebanon One Unified Inter-Organizational System for E-Cards (LOUISE), 
which is managed by WFP. WFP contracts a local bank through a bidding process, the latest 
of which was won by Banque Libano-Française (BLF). BLF issues Common Card, the prepaid 
Mastercard-backed chip cards on which CVA transfers are made. The card can be used to 
withdraw cash at any ATM or to purchase goods from 410 WFP-selected merchants. WFP 
manages the relationship with BLF through a master banking agreement. Partner agencies 
either can have a direct relationship with BLF through a partnership agreement or they can 
contract WFP to manage the relationship on their behalf.
Humanitarian CVA in Jordan is mainly implemented by the Common Cash Facility (CCF) 
and is delivered through Cairo Amman Bank (CAB). CCF was spearheaded by UNHCR (the 
United Nations Refugee Agency) and has been used by up to 22 other partners. CCF uses 
iris-scan technology, EyeCloud (provided by the biometrics company IrisGuard), to authenticate 
the identity of refugees, so that they can make cardless withdrawals from ATMs.22 UNHCR 
manages an overarching contract with CAB, but each humanitarian agency has a direct 
agreement with the bank. WFP also distributes cash and e-vouchers through a CAB-issued 
Mastercard prepaid card called OneCard and is piloting the use of iris scans in its 206 
merchant locations throughout Jordan.23 For a full list of CVA delivery mechanisms and an 
illustration of the main CVA programs in Jordan and Lebanon, see Annex A.
22 See UNHCR (2017).
23 OneCard is the CVA delivery platform managed by WFP in partnership with Jordan Ahli Bank and Middle East Payment 
Systems, a payment services provider.15
LESS oNS  LEArNEDCVA programs in Jordan and Lebanon are highly digitized compared to other CVA 
programs globally.  Humanitarian assistance programs in Jordan and Lebanon have rapidly 
evolved from several uncoordinated cash transfers to coordinated digital payments, with 
prepaid cards that can be used at ATMs or selected merchants. The cards use cutting-edge 
technology, such as biometric iris scans, to verify identity and access delivery channels such 
as ATMs and point-of-sale (POS) devices. (See Table 2  for a detailed list of mechanisms.) 
This rapid evolution has improved national assistance programs. NPTP in Lebanon also has 
leveraged digital tools for food assistance, working in partnership with WFP to allow recipients 
to use their cards at WFP-selected merchants. NAF in Jordan is currently shifting payments 
from physical cash or check to basic bank accounts or mobile wallets. Both NPTP and NAF 
have modernization and digitization plans. However, those fall outside the scope of this paper.

HUMANITARIAN CASH TRANSFERS AND  FINANCIAL INCLUSION
Although coordination mechanisms used in Lebanon and Jordan were not created to explicitly 
advance financial inclusion, their resulting cost reductions and efficiency gains have enabled 
cash transfer programming to pave the way to financial inclusion. The collaboration frameworks 
illustrate several key benefits that can help overcome challenges to linking CVA to financial 
inclusion. For details on CVA collaboration frameworks in Lebanon and Jordan, see Annex D. 
SIMPLIFIED PROCESS FOR RECIPIENTS
A shared cash delivery system enables people to receive transfers from several agencies 
through a single instrument, instead of having to go through several transfers and collection 
processes. Recipients and agencies benefit from this efficiency because everyone spends 
less time training, coordinating with multiple agencies, and managing different payments 
instruments. Recipients like consolidated payment instruments and streamlined operational 
processes (Creti 2015; Sikander and Weaver 2017). 
LOWER COSTS WITH CASH DISBURSEMENT
Humanitarian  agencies in Lebanon and Jordan have significantly reduced costs by sharing 
resources and increasing their negotiating power with FSPs. As a group, they have larger 
volumes of transfers and thus can negotiate discounted bulk pricing. For example, CCF in 
Jordan has negotiated lower bank fees by pooling CVA volume, which reduces costs from 
2.5–5 percent to 1.32 percent of the value loaded onto the card (Gilert and Austin 2017). 
Additionally, collaboration appears to reduce the cost and administrative burden associated 
with each agency tendering, contracting, and managing an FSP. For example, CCF allows 
organizations with one-off or short-term payments to use the system without having to build 
their own cash delivery system. Furthermore, interagency collaboration enables FSPs to 
streamline their engagement with several agencies through a single, coordinated banking 
relationship. This is in addition to efficiency gains from collaborating on other functions such as 
beneficiary communication and training.
LESS DUPLICATION
Collaboration between agencies provides an overall view of recipients, allowing agencies 
to minimize overlaps in households reached and improve targeting to reach the intended 
beneficiaries. In doing so, they can reach a larger population more efficiently, thereby enhancing 
the effectiveness of the humanitarian response. For example, the six members of the Lebanese 
Cash Consortium, which preceded LOUISE, divided coverage geographically, which allowed 
them to individually focus their efforts and resources in discrete regions, while collectively 
maximizing their reach (for more on the Lebanese Cash Consortium, see Annex D). LOUISE 
partners agree that, although it is resource intensive in the short run, collaboration across 
broader functions, such as vulnerability assessments and targeting, is the right approach for an 
effective and efficient humanitarian response, particularly in the case of protracted crises.
In both countries, there has been some level of coordination between humanitarian agencies 
and the governments’ respective social safety nets. This type of coordination is relevant in many 17
LESS oNS  LEArNEDmarkets, as it can go both ways, with the humanitarian agencies leveraging existing safety nets 
and safety nets leveraging humanitarian agencies. 
In markets where national systems for digital social payments are developed, they can be used 
for CVA. In markets where they are not in place, governments may adapt all or some aspects of 
platforms already established for humanitarian assistance to benefit safety nets. Both options 
save a lot of time and resources compared to setting up cash transfer delivery platforms from 
scratch. However, particularly in the case of adapting systems for government payments, 
maintaining a longer-term perspective is important to ensure that the government can take full 
ownership of the systems once crisis response ends. 
Lessons also can be learned from challenges in implementing CVA in both countries. First, 
comingling agency funds in the same wallet, while easier for the beneficiary who has to deal 
with only restricted and unrestricted funds on the same card, complicates the reconciliation 
process. The first-in-first-out method is used to calculate account balances, making 
accounting more complex as the number of agencies on the platform increases. Second, 
card management processes need to be streamlined to avoid lengthy delays. Under LOUISE, 
operations such as card blocking, activation, or re-issuance must be requested via WFP, and 
it may take up to two months to replace a card. During that time, beneficiaries may be forced 
to forgo their monthly assistance as funds get pulled back due to inactivity. However, using a 
single mechanism at the beneficiary level is a great starting point for programs that want to start 
linking to financial inclusion.
4.2  Why did CVA fail to create a pathway  
to financial inclusion?
The Syrian refugee responses in Lebanon and Jordan provide a large-scale experiment to test 
the pathway from CVA to financial inclusion.24 Yet, despite their size and level of digitization, 
these cash transfer programs have not led to financial inclusion several years after the response 
to the Syrian crisis began. This is for one overarching reason:  transfers are not disbursed 
into an account held in the recipients’ own name.  Rather, FSPs who facilitated the 
transfers opened a pooled account for the aid agency, which held the relationship with each 
individual recipient (see Figure 3).
24 There are non-Syrian refugees in both Jordan and Lebanon; however, this study focused on Syrian refugees and their 
host communities. 18
HUMANITARIAN CASH TRANSFERS AND  FINANCIAL INCLUSION
Using pooled accounts is expedient because FSPs do not need to conduct the full range of 
CDD, including know-your-customer (KYC) requirements,25 on thousands of refugees who 
may have limited identity documentation or accessible financial history. Benefits of a pooled-
account approach include:
• Shortens the time that it takes to set up payments, helping to get aid to those who need it as 
quickly as possible.
• Allows agencies sending the cash transfers to negotiate lower fees for bulk transfers with 
the FSP.
• Documents cost-effective delivery for agencies to donors and for donors to their taxpayers.
• Lowers cost and risk for the FSP.
25 CDD describes the full range of actions required of FSPs to comply with anti-money laundering/combating the financing 
of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards as set by the Financial Action Task Force, the global standard-setting body largely 
responsible for AML/CFT. CDD requires that FSPs take steps to identify and verify the identity of customers as well as of 
person(s) on whose behalf a transaction is being conducted (beneficial owners), to understand the purpose and nature of 
the financial transaction and to conduct appropriate ongoing monitoring of the customer to ensure that the transactions 
are consistent with the customer’s profile. While the term “KYC” is more often used, it does not cover the full scope of 
CDD obligations. See “Policy,” CGAP , https://www.cgap.org/topics/policy  and Staschen and Meagher (2018). FIGURE 3.  Typical flow of funds in cash transfer programming in Lebanon and Jordan

Note: In Lebanon, CVA disbursements are in U.S. dollars; however, the smallest amount in ATMs is US$50 and the standard value of transfer is US$175. 
This prevents beneficiaries from withdrawing the full cash transfer payment amount in one transaction. At the time of our study, the currency denomination 
was being reconsidered. Since then, CVA in Lebanon is disbursed in Lebanese pounds due to the deterioration of macroeconomic conditions.19
LESS oNS  LEArNED• Allows government and humanitarian agencies to see the amount of funds that remain in 
each recipient’s account so that they have the option to pull back funds not used within a 
certain time period. This level of oversight is not available if funds are sent to an account held 
by the beneficiary, which is subject to banking privacy regulations and prevailing financial 
consumer protection rules.
While pooling accounts decreases short-term, upfront costs, aid recipients do not 
gain access to a fully functional account, which in turn would make them financially 
included. Even if the transfer is delivered to a prepaid card, the card’s use is restricted to 
cash-out at ATMs and payment at POS devices. It cannot be used to save, send, receive, or 
store funds or to generate a transaction history necessary to access more complex financial 
services such as credit and insurance.26 As a result, money transfer operators (MTOs) and 
traditional microfinance institutions, rather than FSPs delivering CVA, have been the main 
providers of financial services to refugees and low-income host households. However, MTOs 
cannot hold funds, and microfinance institutions in both Lebanon and Jordan are credit-
only institutions that cannot accept deposits. Hence, there is a trade-off between short-
term benefits—such as low costs, reporting capabilities, and fast delivery—and longer-term 
development outcomes of individual and household resilience.
Although there are no clear links between cash transfers and financial inclusion 
yet, the experiences of Lebanon and Jordan show that digital transfers are effective 
channels for building awareness and trust in digital payments,  despite the limited 
functionality of prepaid cards. Agencies in the two countries noted improvements in recipients’ 
understanding of card, ATM, and POS use over time. For example, the number of problems 
with personal identity numbers (PINs) and attempts to withdraw from empty accounts have 
declined as recipients have become more comfortable using their cards. Lebanese recipients, 
who are relatively new to using cards, encounter more problems than refugees. The systems 
humanitarian agencies have established to provide training and respond to customer questions 
on card use—for example, call centers—have raised awareness of digital payments and may be 
used for other financial capability initiatives.
Despite some early success, more needs to be done to achieve financial inclusion. In the 
following section we address three key building blocks for moving toward this vision: 
• Humanitarian and government prioritization of financial inclusion and resilience.
• Enabling regulation and infrastructure. 
• A business case for FSPs. 
A fourth building block—recipient demand—is outside the scope of this paper; however, a brief 
description can be found in Box 2. 
26 Financial account ownership is a key aspect of increasing financial access and is critical for the long-term endeavor of 
creating robust and active financial inclusion. See Bull (2018). 20
HUMANITARIAN CASH TRANSFERS AND  FINANCIAL INCLUSION
BOX 2.   The demand for digital cash transfers: What do recipients prefer?
The preferences and needs of supply-side actors, 
including governments, humanitarian agencies, and 
FSPs, are important to consider. However, it is just 
as important, if not more so, to consider recipient 
experience and preferences. Research (unpublished) 
from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s “Mobile 
Money Solutions for Cash-Based Transfers Assessment 
Report” in 2017 sought to understand the recipient 
experience with cash transfers and digital financial 
products. The study found that aid recipients in 
Jordan preferred cash (hard currency) over vouchers 
because the latter limited choice and was associated 
with the stigma of receiving welfare. Furthermore, it 
was believed that stores increased prices for goods 
redeemable with vouchers. Recipients generally 
were satisfied with the digital tools, including cards 
and biometrics (iris scans), but they did face some 
challenges such as limited number of acceptance 
networks or ATMs being out of service.a
These findings echo the results of three case studies 
from Ethiopia, Bangladesh, and Zimbabwe that looked 
at the effects of financial inclusion on emergency 
cash transfers issued to account-based payment 
mechanisms (Bailey 2017). In these cases, emergency 
transfers did not significantly change financial behaviors: 
at the end of the program, just 10 percent of recipients 
across all three countries were able to independently 
conduct mobile money transactions. Recipients still preferred cash—they withdrew funds from accounts 
before saving, borrowing, or making purchases.
In Zimbabwe, however, a significant minority did choose 
to continue using their mobile money account after 
the program was over. Although no recipient reported 
saving via mobile money before the project, 25 percent 
did so after it. Enabling factors that encouraged use of 
mobile money after the project ended included trust in 
service providers and agents, multiple transfers through 
the same project to increase exposure, and technical 
support provided by the implementing NGOs. 
Similarly, user-centered research conducted in 2018 
found that recipients were less concerned with 
financial inclusion than with features that improved the 
immediate cash transfer experience, such as feeling 
that their input was considered in the design of the 
cash transfer program, receiving transfers through 
trusted entities, and knowing how to troubleshoot 
potential problems that might arise (Sagmeister and 
Seilern 2018). Thus, the report recommended that 
programs be designed to maximize communication 
and net benefits—and thus value for money—rather 
than focused primarily on operational efficiency and 
lower costs.
These case studies provide important lessons and 
programming principles for donors and FSPs to consider 
when piloting DFS programs linked to cash transfers.

BUILDING BLOCKS : 
LINKING CASH TRANSFERS 
to FINANCIAL INCLUSION 
AND  RESILIENCE
5.1  Humanitarian and government prioritization
To encourage CVA providers and FSPs to pursue financial inclusion objectives,  donors 
and governments must make financial inclusion an explicit priority, recognizing 
its importance in contributing to the resilience of recipients. High-level representatives and 
managers need to buy into this vision. This would allow programs on the ground to be 
developed with financial inclusion activities embedded from the beginning, which would prove 
particularly useful in protracted crises situations and for national social safety net programs. It 
also would allow agencies to align operational processes and make decisions that contribute to 
financial inclusion and longer-term resilience. For example, donors currently place a high priority 
on cost efficiency of humanitarian response efforts, which is important to ensure that as much 
funding as possible goes directly to recipients. However, if donors emphasize cost efficiency 
as a top priority, agencies may select an FSP purely based on cost, even if other providers 
may offer more sustainable or more inclusive payment solutions, improved data management 
platforms for beneficiaries, and better quality of service. 
In terms of funds scarcity, humanitarian agencies tend to view idle funds in a recipient’s 
account as a potential flaw in the targeting method, while an FSP would see any residual 
balance as a signal that the individual is trying to save. Current humanitarian processes 
incentivize recipients to withdraw the full transfer amount. However, this undermines potential 
savings and trust in digital services by reinforcing the belief that only hard cash, as opposed 
to an electronic balance, has permanent value. This is a missed opportunity, as illustrated by 22
HUMANITARIAN CASH TRANSFERS AND  FINANCIAL INCLUSION
a recent study that applied behavioral science to cash transfer programs. The study showed 
that an upfront investment of less than US$5 per beneficiary per year resulted in up to 41 
percent more individual savings (Ideas42 2019).
Prioritizing longer term development and financial inclusion also means investing in new skills 
for the humanitarian community. Only 40 percent of humanitarian organizations have the 
capacity to implement CVA, let alone advance financial inclusion (CaLP 2018). Recipients 
also need training on, for example, budget management to help households build savings for 
when cash assistance is no longer available. All this requires longer term funding cycles for 
humanitarian response. Recent trends are encouraging in this regard: multiyear contributions 
have more than doubled in two years, from 7 percent of humanitarian funding in 2016 to 17 
percent in 2018 (Development Initiatives 2019).
5.2 Enabling regulation and infrastructure
DFS can help overcome geographic and cost barriers to the formal financial sector.27 Global 
experience suggests nonbank payment service providers (PSPs) specializing in low-value 
person-to-person and person-to-government payments may be an entry point for unbanked 
people to access formal and regulated financial services. PSPs can be particularly useful in 
markets such as Lebanon and Jordan, where on the one hand, commercial banking services 
are expensive and cater to high-income customers, and on the other, CVA programs offer an 
opportunity to capture cash flows into payment and savings products. 
An enabling regulatory environment for digital financial inclusion needs to be in 
place to link digital cash transfers to financial inclusion.  CGAP has established four 
basic regulatory enablers for DFS: nonbank e-money issuance, use of third-party agents, 
risk-based CDD, and consumer protection rules (Staschen and Meagher 2018). These 
enablers help to establish a regulatory environment that is proportional—one that balances 
financial integrity, stability, and inclusion. This balance is particularly important and challenging 
to achieve in crisis-affected countries. Still, Jordan and Lebanon have made strides in 
implementing the basic regulatory enablers and have had varying degrees of success in 
achieving proportionality. A brief summary and comparison of each is presented in Table 3 . 
Jordan has established a framework that closely aligns with the basic regulatory enablers for 
DFS and thus should help the country achieve financial inclusion goals for both refugees and 
host communities. Highlights of this legal and regulatory framework that are particularly relevant 
to linking cash transfers to financial inclusion include: 
• Enabling both banks and nonbanks to participate in the national payments system (NPS).
• Allowing payment system actors to operate in a structured and transparent environment, 
with clear licensing requirements and scope of operations.
27 For more on the global framework for finance and technology and its ability to accelerate financial inclusion, see IMF (2018).23
buiLDiNg bL ock S:LiNkiNg cAS h trANS fErS to f iNANci AL iNc LuSioN AND  rES iLiENc E • Facilitating a wide range of digital channels and instruments (prepaid cards, mobile wallets, 
biometrics, and more recently basic bank accounts) to enter the market and be used for CVA.
• Establishing tiered KYC requirements and account balance and transaction limits.
Proportional regulation that balances financial integrity, stability, and inclusion 
objectives is a critical precondition for financial systems promoting inclusion 
through cash transfers. In Lebanon, financial inclusion is an important objective of the 
government and the central bank, Banque du Liban (BDL). However, the country’s regulatory 
framework prioritizes integrity and stability to maintain tight control over providers, products, 
and services in the market. Specifically, regulations limit the role of nonbanks in the financial 
sector, and transaction accounts may be offered only by banks. Also, there are restrictions 
on real-time electronic funds transfers, prepaid cards, e-money issuance, and agent banking, 
which leaves little space to develop financial products and services that are relevant and 
accessible to CVA recipients, including low-income Lebanese. There is no supervisory 
approach to financial technology and little acceptance of innovation surrounding financial 
services that are not bank based.

HUMANITARIAN CASH TRANSFERS AND  FINANCIAL INCLUSION
A robust digital infrastructure for national payments is needed to process cash 
transfers.  The central banks in Lebanon and Jordan have invested in NPS to build safe, 
secure, and reliable core payments infrastructures, thereby providing the pipes through which 
digital transactions flow. Payments infrastructure is typically built starting with systems to settle 
and clear large-value and bulk payments, and to eventually extend to low-value retail payments. 
While the former is key for cash transfer programs to be delivered digitally at scale, the latter is 
key for FSPs to develop payments services adapted to low-income segments. 
In Lebanon, BDL established its real-time gross settlement system (RTGS) in 2012 and its 
automated clearing house (ACH) in 2013. In Jordan, the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) upgraded 
its RTGS in 2015 and developed various other retail payment systems. It also unveiled the 
Jordan Mobile Payment (JoMoPay) switch in 2015, which provides payment interoperability 
between mobile wallets and bank accounts, as well as interoperability for ATM withdrawals and 
POS purchases through integration with other retail payment systems. In both countries, ATM 
switches are interoperable, allowing recipients to access funds through any ATM in the country 
(see Annex B for details of the NPS in each country). Because these systems are safe and BOX 3.   Refugees’ identification and access to financial services
Many refugees do not have the identification 
documents (IDs) necessary to open an account, as 
defined both by the government through its regulations 
and by each individual FSP through its internal 
procedures. Even if the government allows FSPs to 
accept a foreign ID or aid agency-issued ID, an FSP 
can choose not to accept it. 
For example, in Jordan, from a strictly legal perspective 
and in the absence of explicit prohibition, refugees 
are authorized to open accounts as foreigners using 
foreign IDs. However, such IDs often are unavailable or 
expired. Almost a decade into the conflict, many Syrian 
passports, which are valid for five years, have expired. 
Refugees have been unable to renew them because 
they can’t access an embassy or the cost of renewal is 
too high (US$200–400 in Jordan). 
Most Syrian refugees in Jordan have a UNHCR-issued 
Asylum Seeker Certificate (ASC), which serves as a 
de facto  form of identification. In addition, since 2015, 
the Ministry of Interior (MoI) has issued IDs for Syrian 
refugees, based on ASC information. The IDs have 
an expiration date and a magnetic strip with biometric 
information that can be accessed through an iris scan 
(MoI card).A MoI card helps refugees access financial accounts. 
However, ID-related requirements are not always clear, 
and they differ depending on the type of account:
• Bank accounts.  Starting in 2013, CBJ’s regulations 
make it mandatory for banks to recognize the 
MoI card as the only valid ID for Syrian nationals 
residing in Jordan after 15 March 2011. This does 
not apply to Syrian nationals who were residents in 
the country before that; they follow the same KYC 
requirements as any other non-Jordanian. 
• Mobile wallets.  Starting in 2017, JoMoPay 
instructions issued by CBJ state that both the MoI 
card and ASC are required to open mobile wallets.
Note that the MoI card is available only to Syrian 
refugees. Refugees from other countries may struggle 
to open an account, even if they have an ID. While 
a full assessment of the ID ecosystem in Lebanon 
and Jordan is beyond the scope of this paper, it is 
important to recognize that an enabling environment 
for financial inclusion requires robust access to and 
acceptance of IDs. National regulations and FSP 
policies about acceptable IDs to open an account 
need to be reviewed in light of barriers refugees or host 
communities face in accessing IDs.25

mostly through ATM and POS networks, as well as through mobile wallet agents in Jordan. The 
systems represent the foundation onto which both markets have been able to build large-scale 
digitized CVA programs. For details on NPS in Lebanon and Jordan, see Annex C.
5.3 A business case for FSPs 
Cash assistance addresses the basic needs of the poorest and most vulnerable 
people.  These segments typically do not use formal financial services, rather, they rely on 
informal mechanisms to manage their financial needs. Empirical evidence suggests that 
households at the bottom of the pyramid require interventions such as access to food, shelter, 
or skills. For example, evidence from the graduation approach shows that microcredit is far 
more effective at alleviating poverty when it is bundled with savings and nonfinancial services 
such as business training (Abed 2015).28 Formal financial services, even those meant for 
low-income customers, usually do not meet the needs of very poor people. Cash transfer 
beneficiaries who are targeted for their high vulnerability may not be the most obvious clients for 
FSPs (see Box 4).
Therefore, the FSP revenue model for cash assistance is based on bulk payment fees often 
paid by implementing agencies rather than on recipient transactions. In Lebanon and Jordan, 
banks have been the main FSPs channeling cash transfers to beneficiaries. As described in 
Section 4.2, on the front end, they may provide a prepaid card to each household. On the 
back end, instead of opening individual accounts for each recipient, they open a single pooled 
account for the humanitarian organization—the bank’s contractual client (either by itself or as 
lead in a consortium). In such case, the bank’s revenues stem from (i) providing and managing 
the card when there is one (called a card management fee, usually a fixed fee of US$4–5 
per card) and (ii) taking a fee for making the monthly transfer. The latter (referred to as a 
disbursement, loading, or transaction fee) is either a fixed fee below a certain threshold plus a 
percentage of the transferred amount or only a percentage of the transferred amount (usually 
0.5–2 percent of the transferred amount). See Annex E for more details on CVA pricing. 
In some cases, the implementing agency incurs additional costs from authentication, such 
as an iris-scan fee, which represents 15 percent of the transaction fee. There also are 
communication costs such as SMS notification costs of US$0.01–0.11 per message. These 
costs do not generate profits for FSPs, especially since they often are for services provided 
by third parties. FSP revenue from issuance or loading fees (bulk payment fees) are expected 
to cover all expenses, including physical cash management (e.g., maintaining cash availability 
at ATMs), ATM maintenance, and card management (e.g., customer service requests such 
as for a lost card or PIN.) This revenue model is different from the standard one in that banks 
may forgo many typical fees or offer significantly lower ones, such as fees paid by merchants 
per transaction (typically 3 percent) as well as fees paid by merchants to rent or maintain a 
28 Graduation refers to a sequenced series of interventions designed to help extremely poor households secure their basic 
consumption levels and move into sustainable livelihoods. 26
HUMANITARIAN CASH TRANSFERS AND  FINANCIAL INCLUSION
POS device. In addition, cash transfer recipients do not pay the ATM withdrawal fees charged 
to regular bank clients. As such, FSPs dealing with cash transfers for the first time may find it 
difficult to price their services appropriately and competitively.
Moving toward a cash transfer model that facilitates financial inclusion and thus 
greater resilience by providing recipients with individual accounts would require a 
dramatic shift where FSPs see recipients rather than the implementing agency, as 
their main clients. To provide individual accounts, the bank would need to conduct CDD 
procedures on each recipient, which would increase its operating expenses. The costs of 
CDD may not be justified for cash transfer recipients who likely will carry low- to no-balance 
accounts, which are not profitable to FSPs. BOX 4.   Financial lives of Syrian refugees and affected communities in Lebanon
In 2019, the World Bank Group and CGAP 
commissioned a qualitative demand-side assessment 
of refugees and their host communities’ access to and 
use of financial services in Lebanon.a The research 
provided insight into the following three segments:b
• Surviving.  Vulnerable refugee households with a 
negative net income most months; likely to rely on 
daily and seasonal labor for work; likely to live in 
informal accommodations; not likely to receive aid; 
have growing debt.
• Struggling.  Refugees and low-income Lebanese; 
more likely to have formal accommodations; likely 
to alternate between positive and negative net 
incomes, often because of seasonal fluctuations; 
mainly do not receive aid. 
• Managing.  Middle-income Lebanese households 
with more stable income sources. 
Access to finance was extremely low in the sample. 
Loans were needed to finance expenditures for 
low-income Lebanese, particularly in winter. Debt was 
accessed mainly through informal channels such as 
family and friends, store purchases made on credit, and 
savings groups. When asked why they did not have access to formal financial services, most respondents 
cited lack of money or lack of awareness. A small 
proportion of respondents mentioned discomfort with 
interest rates due to religious belief. Syrian refugees 
reported even lower access to formal financial services 
than poor Lebanese. Many believed that these services 
are not accessible to Syrians despite there being no 
legal barriers.
Health-related financial shocks, such as illness or 
death in the family, were the most frequent shocks 
and had the biggest impact on all households. While 
middle-income Lebanese were more likely to benefit 
from insurance coverage through public social security 
or employer-provided schemes, vulnerable Lebanese 
and Syrian refugees generally did not have any 
form of formal insurance. Shocks of less concern to 
households included loss or damage to assets such 
as accommodations, cars, household appliances, and 
productive assets or crops.
The study showed that despite common perception, 
both Lebanese and Syrians in Lebanon lead active 
financial lives. They draw heavily on informal financial 
services, and in the case of Syrian refugees, they use 
card-based cash transfer systems, highlighting an 
untapped opportunity for FSPs.

a.  Lebanese participants were segmented based on income (low income if less than $450 per month; middle income if between $450 and $1,500 per 
month), while Syrian refugees were segmented based on accommodation formality. 
b.  The three segments mirror those developed by Making Cents and Sanad in their 2017 study of the microfinance markets in Lebanon and Jordan.27
buiLDiNg bL ock S:LiNkiNg cAS h trANS fErS to f iNANci AL iNc LuSioN AND  rES iLiENc E In addition, cash transfer recipients differ from other market segments in ways that affect the 
cost of service. For example, our research shows that they frequently check their balances and 
attempt to withdraw funds from an empty account. While balance inquiries incur only a marginal 
cost, several failed transactions generate unforeseen costs for banks that are not familiar with 
the low-income market. This is especially the case when such transactions occur with ATMs 
outside of their network, as they pay a service fee for using other banks’ networks. 
Aside from these costs, research shows that only a small portion of low-income, let alone CVA, 
recipients are likely to be economically active enough to be profitable to FSPs. For instance, 
research on the microfinance sector in Lebanon and Jordan estimated that 15 percent of 
refugees were deemed eligible for loans, but the majority (50–70 percent) were too vulnerable 
to benefit from formal credit services.29 Banks need to better understand how to work with CVA 
beneficiaries to avoid common pitfalls that would lead to inadequate pricing.
To transition to a recipient-oriented market that supports financial inclusion by 
offering a sustainable business case for FSPs, market actors need to drive down 
costs and identify other revenue sources through innovation, piloting, and research.  
Digital technology, including digital transfers and biometric authentication, already has helped 
to lower the overall cost of administering cash transfers. Another way to lower costs is to 
transfer funds to certain types of accounts that are less expensive for FSPs to maintain. These 
include subaccounts held on separate banking platforms and e-money accounts provided by 
nonbank payments companies that bypass card issuance fees. In many countries, regulators 
allow for a risk-based approach to CDD that allows FSPs to lower costs associated with CDD 
by offering lower-tiered accounts that have a simplified due diligence process. Furthermore, as 
more countries move toward universal digital IDs, these IDs will facilitate client onboarding and 
authentication, which can reduce fraud and misallocation of funds. Ongoing pilots in Jordan 
using mobile wallets and basic bank accounts for cash transfers will provide further insight 
into how these tools may or may not be able to change the fundamental economics of cash 
transfers, while also improving the recipient experience.30 
To improve the FSP business model, stakeholders should consider enabling wider 
acceptance of cards or value-added services.  Currently, agencies in Lebanon and Jordan 
restrict use of the prepaid cards to ATMs or WFP-approved merchants. However, if cards could 
be used on any POS device, the FSP could earn revenue from interchange fees when the cards 
are used at other merchants. If recipients could use the cards at more locations, they would 
have less need to withdraw cash, thereby lowering fees associated with ATM transactions. To 
facilitate this, donor and government support for unrestricted cash assistance is important, 
as it would allow broader use of funds (versus limiting use to certain products, services, and 
merchants). Promoting agent acceptance of electronic cash payments (cards and mobile 
money) also will help strengthen the business case for FSPs. Finally, capturing remittances 
flows could create value for FSPs and help recipients maintain an account.

30 NAF’s cash transfer program is moving to mobile wallets or basic bank accounts; Al Hulool has partnered with UNHCR 
to disburse unconditional cash via mobile wallets and companion cards; Dinarak has been working with GIZ on behalf of 
the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development to promote the use of mobile wallets among 
refugees and Jordanians.28
HUMANITARIAN CASH TRANSFERS AND  FINANCIAL INCLUSION
Implementing agencies can help by reviewing their approach to evaluating FSP cost 
proposals.  Pricing arrangements between CVA providers and FSPs, for instance, should 
balance the interests of humanitarian/government agencies and FSPs. Humanitarian agencies 
in Lebanon and Jordan are highly cost-sensitive and likely would select the FSP with the lowest 
bid. However, FSPs, especially those new to the market, that make unrealistically low bids will 
not be sustainable. When evaluating cost proposals from potential FSP partners, agencies 
may consider different business arrangements that would allow FSPs to keep fees low while 
still ensuring more sustainable pricing. Donors and governments can help by explicitly allowing 
implementing agencies to evaluate FSP proposals based on several factors, including financial 
inclusion potential for refugees and host communities (e.g., account ownership or expansion of 
ATMs), rather than on cost alone.
There is a role for patient capital and smart subsidies.  Those seeking to accelerate 
financial inclusion can support development programs that help FSPs better understand 
low-income segments, refine business models and approaches, and subsidize the expansion 
of distribution networks (agents and ATMs) to reach low-income segments. Development 
finance institutions have used targeted lines of credit to protect FSPs against default risk and, 
if structured appropriately, can help incentivize FSPs to remain active during crisis periods. 
Donors also can look to the wide range of innovative financing instruments currently being used 
to attract more private sector funding and investment in response to crisis.31 In countries where 
forcibly displaced people have access to economic opportunities, donors and development 
actors can support pilots and experimentation, such as with graduation programs, to better 
understand how to help recipients move from CVA to financial inclusion.32

CONCLUSION  
AND  NEXT STEPS
A DEEP LOOK AT JORDAN AND LEBANON’S EXPERIENCES WITH CASH 
transfer programming helps stakeholders understand the challenges inherent in 
creating pathways from cash transfers to financial inclusion, if financial inclusion is 
a stated objective. Not only did these two countries experience the largest, and likely most 
digital, humanitarian cash and voucher programs in history, they also have a more robust 
payment infrastructure than many other conflict-affected countries. Yet, even with an enabling 
regulatory environment in the case of Jordan and considerable progress on digitization and 
collaboration among humanitarian agencies and with the government, financial inclusion is not 
yet a reality for those refugees and vulnerable host communities who receive cash assistance.
Our analysis indicates that the following would create strong links between cash transfer 
programming, financial inclusion, and resilience:
• Translate high-level commitments on financial inclusion into program priorities and objectives.
• Focus on improving the regulatory environment for digital financial inclusion at scale.
• Increase the number of use cases through piloting and experimentation.
• Build the business case for FSPs.
• Link cash transfers and financial inclusion to resilience.
• Engage with global standard-setting bodies.
Translate high-level commitments on financial inclusion into program priorities and 
objectives.  As discussed in Section 5.3, humanitarian agencies chose not to open accounts 
for recipients in Jordan and Lebanon for a variety of reasons. Creating pathways to financial 
inclusion is not business as usual for humanitarian agencies or host governments, neither 
is it for FSPs, which are used to serving higher income segments. Organizational change is 
required to support this shift, and institution leadership must send clear signals to technical 
staff on the importance of promoting resilience and better use of scarce donor resources. 
Senior-level commitment will provide the operational space for technical staff to innovate, take 
the time to better understand the needs and behavior of cash transfer recipients, and invest in 30
HUMANITARIAN CASH TRANSFERS AND  FINANCIAL INCLUSION
the infrastructure and human resources needed to launch such programs (see Box 5 ). Senior 
leadership must also initiate discussions with government leaders, who may be concerned 
about the program’s impact on regulations and the local economy. These discussions can help 
bridge the knowledge gap between the financial, public, and humanitarian sectors on technical 
topics and legal constraints. 
Focus on improving the regulatory environment for digital financial inclusion at 
scale. Stakeholders, including donors and implementing agencies, can work directly with 
governments to help ensure that an enabling regulatory environment for financial inclusion is in 
place (see Section 5.2). For instance, in Lebanon, the regulatory framework emphasizes that 
accounts can be offered only by banks. The aim is to mitigate financial integrity risks. Yet this 
keeps nonbank actors from participating in the market, which can drive down costs.
Jordan, on the other hand, has an established regulatory framework that reflects a proportional, 
risk-based approach and allows for nonbanks to offer accounts. FSPs in Jordan can develop 
simplified, lower-cost accounts that are more likely to be sustainable and create pathways to 
financial inclusion for cash transfer recipients. Regulators can help by emphasizing consumer 
protection: the poverty profile and high 
levels of financial exclusion among cash 
transfer recipients make them more 
susceptible to fraud and mistakes.
Increase the number of use cases 
through piloting and experimentation. 
The experience of these two countries 
shows that despite the theoretical link 
between CVA and financial inclusion, we 
do not yet have an exact roadmap to 
making this link a reality. Therefore, we 
must continue to push the limiting factors 
uncovered by this research and experiment 
with new approaches to learn, adapt, 
and scale. Several pilots in Jordan are 
already testing the use of mobile wallets 
for cash transfers by providing recipients 
a transaction account in their own name. 
For example, the PSP Dinarak has been 
working with GIZ to promote the use 
of mobile wallets among refugees and 
Jordanians. Al Hulool, another PSP, has 
recently partnered with UNHCR to disburse 
unconditional cash via mobile wallets and 
companion cards. Agencies involved in 
voucher programming, for example WFP in 
Lebanon, could play a role in incentivizing 
and encouraging participating merchants BOX 5.  Internal process review
Once financial inclusion is recognized as an 
objective, stakeholders need to act on their 
commitments by incorporating financial inclusion 
goals into their strategies, program designs, and 
implementation efforts.
• For FSPs, this means reviewing onboarding 
requirements and pricing structures, especially 
those that may have created intended or 
unintended barriers for vulnerable communities 
that want to open and use an account.
• For humanitarian and government agencies, this 
means reviewing segment targeting procedures 
and understanding how to give recipients the 
opportunity to save funds without sacrificing 
other goals of cash assistance programming.
• For regulators this means establishing a 
proportional set of regulations that responsibly 
promote the inclusion of traditionally underserved 
consumers into the formal financial sector.
• For all, it means establishing proper data 
protection standards so that partners can  
share data securely and with consent of cash 
transfer recipients.31
coNc LuSioN AND NE xt StEpSto accept cashless payment instruments (cards or mobile money) to further develop the DFS 
ecosystem. Others are experimenting with combining financial and nonfinancial data to generate 
transaction histories of forcibly displaced people to build credit histories and to make their credit 
history and other identity data available through secure applications that work across borders.33
These initiatives are still small but if scaled up, they may become pathways to financial services, 
even when forcibly displaced people return to their home countries or settle somewhere else. 
Donors need to provide financial and technical resources and influence operational incentives to 
facilitate this type of piloting for humanitarian agencies and FSPs themselves.
Build the business case for FSPs. As outlined in Section 5.3, agencies may struggle to 
persuade FSPs that low-income cash transfer recipients are potential customers. However, 
there are ways to strengthen the business case for FSPs and persuade them to have a direct 
relationship with CVA recipients and other low-income segments to support financial inclusion. 
More demand-side research can help FSPs already in the market better understand this segment 
and attract new FSPs with lower cost structures. Donors should allow implementing agencies 
to evaluate FSP cost proposals based on financial inclusion potential in addition to total cost of 
issuing cash transfers. For example, they could embed in the agreement an incentive for FSPs to 
provide better service to recipients by rewarding spending directly from an account. 
In addition, donors can provide advisory services and smart subsidies to build FSP capacity to 
understand target markets emerging from humanitarian crises. Key topics for advisory services 
may include developing appropriate pricing models and introducing relevant payments, savings, 
and credit products to build a long-term customer base. Key products and platforms can be 
developed that create added value for FSPs and thus an incentive to serve CVA recipients over 
the long term. Reviewing business conduct rules around fund recovery can support greater 
trust and use of electronic payments. 
Link CVA and financial inclusion to resilience. Viewing CVA, financial inclusion, and 
resilience as three interacting objectives can help ensure that short-term and long-term objectives 
are viewed as complementary, rather than as trade-offs. Despite the organizational challenges 
documented through this research, ultimately, cash transfer programming and financial inclusion 
efforts need to be delivered in a way that allows vulnerable people to become more resilient by 
improving their ability to absorb financial shocks and to pursue stable livelihoods.
Some initiatives are pushing the boundaries and bringing each of these objectives together into 
one program. In Jordan, for example, GIZ has set up the Digi#ances program and the Gates 
Foundation is implementing the Mobile Money for Resilience program. In Lebanon, World Bank 
financing is being used to help the government pilot a graduation program for selected NPTP 
recipients. These programs can strengthen FSPs’ understanding of specific segments, identify 
gaps in policy or infrastructure, and support the design of financial products that are tailored to 
this segment, for example, savings products with behavioral prompts that encourage use.
33 See, e.g., Bitga (2017). 32
HUMANITARIAN CASH TRANSFERS AND  FINANCIAL INCLUSION
Engage with global standard-setting bodies. As our research shows, many FSPs in 
Jordan and Lebanon are reluctant to serve low-income populations, especially those that have 
been forcibly displaced, because they would have to comply with onerous CDD requirements, 
particularly in markets where the threat of de-risking and losing correspondent banking 
relationships are high.
As discussed in Section 5.3, to overcome FSP constraints to serving CVA recipients as 
customers, regulators need to allow for and encourage FSPs to adopt a risk-based CDD 
framework to help link humanitarian cash transfers to financial services. The framework would 
need to follow global policy and regulation on financial integrity as set by the Financial Action 
Task Force and related bodies. Given the severity and frequency of humanitarian crises, global 
standard setters need to provide technical guidance to markets on how to use proportional 
CDD and on other issues related to validating identification.
Having such guidance in place before the onset of a humanitarian crisis will make for a quick 
and effective response when a crisis does arise. It would help FSPs and regulators manage 
technical issues as they balance financial inclusion, stability, and integrity concerns. In addition, 
regulators can consider research and experimentation on innovative approaches to CDD, 
especially those that lower costs by collaboration—sharing the burden of CDD processes, 
including ID verification, risk profiling, and transaction monitoring and reporting—among FSPs 
and the government (Lyman et al. 2018). 33

CVA DELIVERY SYSTEMS  
iN LEBANON AND  JORDAN
Although the collaboration frameworks in Lebanon and Jordan have garnered much attention 
as models for cash coordination, the CVA delivery mechanisms in both countries also include 
bilateral arrangements with FSPs. This section summarizes the various CVA delivery mechanisms, 
including those managed through collaborative frameworks and bilateral relationships.

LOUISE (BLF) Prepaid card 
(Mastercard 
chip card)• Any ATM
• POS (WFP 
merchants 
only)• BLF serves as the service provider for the cash 
delivery platform 
• The Common Card, a prepaid card, works both 
as an open-loop card for ATM cash withdrawals 
within Lebanon and as closed-loop card at specific 
merchants contracted by WFP• WFP manages the master 
banking agreement (MBA) 
• Agencies can have a direct 
relationship with BLF through 
a partnership agreement in 
MBA, or contract WFP as 
the platform manager
Card-based 
system, CSC 
BankPrepaid card 
(proprietary, 
magstripe) Any ATM • Before launch of LOUISE, UNHCR and other NGOs 
used CSC’s platform for card issuance 
• Several NGOs still use cards issued by CSC; however, 
they do not combine disbursements in one card
• Cards issued by CSC work on all ATMs in Lebanon• Agreements between NGOs 
and CSC Bank are bilateral; 
terms and conditions are 
agreed on an individual 
basis
Card-based

NGOs
• Users can receive either prepaid cards or vouchers, 
which can be used at merchants defined in the 
RedRose platform
• In addition to payments, the platform covers 
different modules to manage the entire 
humanitarian program lifecycle• Agreements between NGOs 
and RedRose are bilateral; 
terms and conditions are 
agreed on an individual 
basis

effective to partner with LibanPost or MTOs than 
with banks
• Beneficiaries receive ID cards, which are used to 
verify their identity in order to receive their CTP 
disbursement
• Cash is disbursed at LibanPost or MTO branches/
agent locations• Agreements between 
agencies and FSPs 
are bilateral; terms and

HUMANITARIAN CASH TRANSFERS AND  FINANCIAL INCLUSION
Since CVA in Lebanon primarily uses prepaid cards for cash disbursement, it relies on payment 
infrastructure already in place and operated by BDL and private payments systems operators. 
CVA transactions are processed by domestic ATM switches. The transactions between the 
domestic ATM switches are cleared through BDL -CLEAR and settled through BDL -RTGS.

Inter-Agency System 
for E-Cards (LOUISE)LOUISE is the main collaboration framework CVA in 
Lebanon. It started with the desire for a single FSP 
to provide recipients with one card for multiagency 
transfers. It was preceded by WFP’s OneCard system,a 
which has since been replaced by the LOUISE

Lebanon Cash 
ConsortiumActive from December 2014 to May 2017, the 
Lebanese Cash Consortium was composed of six 
NGOs. Like LOUISE, the impetus behind starting the 
consortium was to establish a shared cash delivery 
platform. It closed due to lack of funding, as donors 
began to channel the majority of funds for CVA through 
UN agencies.• ACTED, CARE, International

Common Cash 
Facility (CCF)CCF is based on a public-private partnership 
between Cairo Amman Bank (CAB), UNHCR, and the 
biometrics company, IrisGuard. Multiple humanitarian 
and government agencies can deliver funds to the 
same recipients using subwallets linked to a UNHCR 
case ID. Refugee recipients can withdraw funds at 
CAB ATMs across the country using an iris scan. 
Jordanian recipients can withdraw funds at any CAB 
ATM using a card and PIN. CCF is expanding to 
include mobile wallets for CVA disbursement.• As of July 2018, CCF had 
22 members, including 
UNHCR, UNICEF, Action 
Contre la Faim, ACTED, 
Medair, PU-AMI, World Relief 
Germany, Save the Children, 
Danish Refugee Council, and 
government participation 
through NAF.• Systems and processes for

recipient registration (for the 
iris scan), dispute resolution,

WFP OneCard is CVA delivery platform managed by WFP 
in partnership with Jordan Ahli Bank and Middle East 
Payment Systems, a PSP. OneCard allows recipients 
to receive assistance as an electronic value voucher 
redeemable at WFP merchants or as an ATM cash 
withdrawal. The prepaid cards are Mastercard branded.• As of May 2018, members 
included UN Relief and 
Works Agency for Palestine 
Refugees, with the Food and

a. In December 2014, the WFP launched OneCard, which was a prepaid card that could be used on POS devices and ATMs. OneCard was issued 
by BLF as a Mastercard chip card. It is no longer used in Lebanon, as it was replaced by the LOUISE Common Card.42

CVA PRICING STRUCTURE  
iN LEBANON AND  JORDAN
Note that flat transaction fees disadvantage NGOs with small transfer values. CCF charges 
a percentage-based disbursement fee regardless of the value of disbursement. As a result, 
the fee charged to all members is equally proportionate to their transfer values. In the case of 
LOUISE, however, a flat fee is charged on each load below a certain amount. As a result, the 
LOUISE pricing structure disadvantages NGOs with a large caseload but low-value transfers Fee Type Members Harmonized processes

GLOSSARY
Term Definitiona
Basic needs Essential goods, utilities, services, or resources required on a regular or 
seasonal basis by households to ensure long-term survival AND minimum 
living standards, without resorting to negative coping mechanisms or 
compromising their health, dignity, and essential livelihood assets.
Cash and voucher 
assistance (CVA)All programs where cash transfers or vouchers for goods or services are 
directly provided to recipients. In the context of humanitarian assistance, 
the term refers to the provision of cash transfers or vouchers to individuals, 
households, or community recipients—not to governments or other state 
actors. “Cash” or “cash assistance” specifically refers to cash transfers only—
these terms do not mean “cash and voucher assistance.” However, cash and 
voucher assistance has also been referred to as “cash-based Interventions,” 
“cash-based assistance,” and “cash transfer programming,” among other 
terms. “Cash and voucher assistance” is the recommended term.
Cash transfer Assistance in the form of money—either physical currency or e-cash—to 
individuals, households, or communities. Unrestricted in terms of use and 
distinct from restricted modalities, including vouchers and in-kind assistance.
ClearingbTransmitting, reconciling, and in some cases, confirming financial transactions 
before settlement, potentially including netting transactions and establishing 
final positions for settlement. Sometimes this term is also applied (imprecisely) 
to settlement. 
E-transfer Digital transfer of money or vouchers from the implementing agency to a 
recipient. Provides access to cash, goods, and/or services through mobile 
devices, electronic vouchers, or cards (e.g., prepaid, ATM, credit, or debit). 
May also be called digital payments; it is an umbrella term for e-cash and 
e-vouchers.
E-voucher A card or code that is electronically redeemed at a participating vendor. Can 
represent cash or commodity value and is stored and redeemed using a range 
of electronic devices (e.g., mobile phone, smart card, point-of-sale device).
Financial infrastructurecThe underlying foundation for the financial system, including the institutions, 
information, technologies, and rules and standards that enable financial 
intermediation. Credit bureaus; collateral registries; and payment, remittance, 
and securities settlement systems are vital parts of a country’s financial 
infrastructure. In this report, analysis of the financial infrastructure focuses on 
payment systems. 45
Acro Nym STerm Definitiona
Financial services  
provider (FSP)An entity that provides financial services, which may include e-transfer 
services. May include e-voucher companies, financial institutions (e.g., banks 
and microfinance institutions), or mobile network operators. Includes many 
entities (e.g., investment funds, insurance companies, accountancy firms) 
beyond those that offer humanitarian cash transfers or voucher services, 
hence within CVA literature FSP generally refers to those providing transfer 
services.
Multipurpose cash 
transfer (MPC)A transfer (either regular or one-off) corresponding to the amount of money 
a household needs to cover, fully or partially, a set of basic and/or recovery 
needs. Transfers designed to address several needs, with the transfer value 
calculated accordingly. Unrestricted in terms of use as they can be spent as 
the recipient chooses. Also called multipurpose cash grants or multipurpose 
cash assistance.
National payment 
systemdThe underlying foundation of a country’s financial system. Comprises all 
institutions, information, technologies, payment instruments, rules, and 
standards that enable exchange of monetary value. Key elements may 
include automated clearing houses (ACH), large-value interbank settlement 
systems, and platforms for person-to-person transfers.
Payment systemeA set of instruments, procedures, and rules for transferring funds between 
or among participants. Includes the participants and the entity or entities 
operating the instruments, procedures, and rules.
Point of sale (POS) Devices used to perform digital payment transactions carried out in retail 
stores, restaurants, or mobile locations.
Restriction / Restricted 
transferRefers to limits on the use of assistance by recipients. Applies to the range 
of goods and services that the assistance can be used to purchase, and 
the places where it can be used. The degree of restriction may vary—from 
the requirement to buy specific items, to buying from a general category 
of goods or services. Vouchers are restricted by default because they are 
inherently limited in where and how they can be used. In-kind assistance also 
is restricted. Cash transfers are unrestricted in terms of use by recipients.
Third-party agentsfUsed by banks and other financial services providers instead of traditional 
branches to reach more customers at a lower cost. May be an established 
distribution network, such as post offices or retail chains, or be independent, 
small-scale traders and other retailers. Agents are often able to conduct basic 
financial transactions, such as withdrawals, deposits, money transfers, and 
payments on behalf of financial services providers, depending on rules and 
regulations.
Sector-specific 
interventionDesigned to achieve sector-specific objectives. Sector-specific assistance can
