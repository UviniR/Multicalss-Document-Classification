Small and medium enterprises can employ a digital payment system to increase the trade and satisfy the trading partners and
other stakeholders. The use of digital payment system faster the business transactions, and decrease the cost among parties.
This study conducted to examines the effects of the digital payment system on SME’s performance. This study used a
technology-organizational-environmental framework to investigate the effects of the digital payment system. This study
used a closed-ended self-administered questionnaire to collect data. Data collected from September 2019 to November 2019.
The respondents of the study were executives and owners of SMEs. The partial least squares structural equation modeling
approach utilized to analyze the data. The findings of the study include significant effects of technology, organizational,
environmental, and use of digital payment systems on SME’s performance. This study helps the owner of SME’s to execute
the digital payment system to foster trade and relationship with stakeholders.

1.INTRODUCTION
Globally, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are
entering into the 4.0 era, in which optimization has been
employing the big data, the technology of artificial intelligence,
and the Internet of Things (Wahlster, 2012). In this era,
technology innovation is playing a significant role in producingproducts or services. Products or services are not evaluated
only by its utility and functions, but also by the convenience
of use, efficiency, and delivery time. Technology innovation
happens across the sectors and industries, also in the finance
sector (Mustapha, 2018); the digital payment system is
considered the newest form in many developing countries.SJIF Impact Factor(2019) : 8.045|| DOI:10.36713/epra2012 e-ISSN : 2347 - 9671| p- ISSN : 2349 - 0187 Volume - 7,  Issue- 12, December 2019|
80 EPRA International Journal of Economic and Business ReviewAccording to (Sanghita & Indrajit, 2017), it is defined as a
“collection of components and processes that enables two or
more parties to transact and exchange monetary value via
electronic means.” There are increasing issues related to the
traditional (paper-based) form of the payment system, such
as the significant cost involved in printing cash, risk of theft
and robbery, increasing cost of employment, the
establishment of branches to handle cash, mutilated noted
(Xena & Rahadi, 2019). Whereas digital payment system
provides several advantages such as transparent transaction,
cost savings, faster payouts, decrease time use, better tracking,
and increased trust, user-friendly, expense control and so on
(Fatonah, Yulandari, & Wibowo, 2018). The advancement in
technology encourages payment paradigm form paper-based
payment systems to the digital payment system. Additionally,
in developing countries government (Mishra, 2017) and
management supports  (AlBar & Hoque, 2019), the use of
digital payment.
In particular, Ghana is considered one of the fastest-
growing mobile money markets in Africa; in 2017, the total
value of the mobile money reached $ 29 billion (Ozyurt, 2019),
and in 2018, over 13 million active accounts noted (Digital,
2019). The literacy rate of the country increased from 59.9
percent in 2000 to 79.0 percent in 2018 and is emerging with
17.02 percent (Knoema, 2018). According to Global
Connectivity Index, the country is ranked 71 (Knoema, 2018),
with a 39 percent internet penetration rate (IWS, 2019).
(Amediku, 2019), stated that various economic, public policy,
and financial factors are encouraging determinants behind the
shift of payment system in Ghana. Nowadays’, the country’s
government is enthusiastically investing in e-payment methods
such as PayPal. These services will sooner enable SMEs’ to
receive the payment across the globe (JB, 2018). Globally,
SME’s constitute over 90 percent of enterprises, generate
approximately 50 percent of employment and contribute over
40 percent to GDP in developing countries (WB, 2019).
Specifically, in Ghana, SMEs account for more than 92 percent
to all businesses, and contribution to GDP exceeds 70 percent
(Peprah, Mensah, & Akosah, 2016). The existing literature
confirmed the significance of SMEs in the growth of economies
(Fening, Appiah, & Frempong, 2017; Han, Xiang, & Yang,
2018; Rahman, Ahmad, & Taghizadeh, 2019).payment system (Sivathanu, 2019), perceived usefulness,
perceived benefits and perceived ease of use. Most of the
scholar employed the technology acceptance model (Davis,
1989),  Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of
technology(Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, & Davis, 2003). This
article employs diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory (Rogers,
Singhal, & Quinlan, 2003), and Technology, organizational,
environmental (TOE) (Tornatzky, Fleischer, & Chakrabarti,
1990) framework to investigate the effects of the digital
payment system on SMEs’ performance in developing
countries. Though, enough literature is available on antecedents
and intention to use of the digital payment system. However,
very few related discussed the effects of the digital payment
system on SMEs’ performance. Henceforth, this, the study
contributes to the existing literature of the TOE model, DOI
theory and developing countries specifically Ghana.
This paper initiate with a literature-based on the use of
the digital payment system and its effects on SMEs’
performance. It then includes the methodology and results
analysis, research limitation, and future studies.
2.LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1Theoretical Support
The existing studies using the TOE framework have
investigated the various factors and found such determinants
vital for many information system usages (Seethamraju &
Diatha, 2019). Such as (Soto-Acosta, Popa, & Palacios-
Marqués, 2017) used the TOE framework to develop the
conceptual model to investigate the effects of human resource
practices and web knowledge is sharing on innovation
performance in SMEs’ of the manufacturing sector in
developing countries. Moreover, (Ahmad, Abu Bakar, &
Ahmad, 2019), also used a TOE framework based on DOI to
investigate the effects of social media adoption on SMEs’
performance. Besides, (Aboelmaged, 2018), investigate the
factors of sustainable practices and their effects on competitive
capabilities by employing the TOE framework. This article
employs the TOE model along with the few characteristics of
DOI theory to investigate the impacts of the digital payment
system on SMEs’ performance. Additionally, with regards to
the environmental perspective which is not apart from the
DOI theory, hence the author believes that TOE is the most
appropriate model to be employed. As displayed in figure I,
of the conceptual model, each construct has separate
dimensions. The computability, cost-effectiveness, relative
advantage of technology construct, top management support
of organizational construct and external pressure of
environmental construct.The prior studies investigated the factor affecting the
adoption of digital payment system includes entrepreneur
characteristics, ease of use (Sokobe, 2015), trust, cost, security,
convenience, benefits awareness, IT skills, flexibility (Kabir,
Saidin, & Ahmi, 2017), behavioral intention to use digital
payment system and innovation resistance to use digital

2.2.1Technological Support
This study used three characteristics of innovation, such
as compatibility, relative advantage, and cost-effectiveness
(Eelu & Nakakawa, 2018; Trivedi & Mago, 2013). Ease of
use is the extent to which an individuals’ beliefs that
implementation of new technology would be “free of effort”
(Hidayanto, Hidayat, Sandhyaduhita, & Handayani, 2015).
In support, (Özkan, Bindusara, & Hackney, 2010), found a
significant relationship between ease of use or usability and
intention to use the digital payment system. Relative
advantage is the degree to which supporters of the new
technology think particular innovation provides more benefits
as compared to available. (Liao & Chen, 2019), found a
significant relationship between relative advantage and
intention to use the digital payment system. Therefore,
following the hypothesis proposed.
H1: Technology construct has significant effects on the use
of digital payment systems in developing countries.
2.2.2Organizational Construct
This construct includes the internal characteristics of
the firms, for instance, the size of the firms, organizational
structure and culture, employees’ behavior and so on. The
author argued that managerial support encourages employees
towards the usage of an electronic payment system or any of
the newest technology. (Qatawneh, Aldhmour, & Alfugara,
2015), studied the impact of an electronic payment system in
the telecommunication industry of Jordon, the sample of study
includes 320 employees of Orange company. The findings of
the study showed a significant impact of top management
support to the adoption of the electronic payment system,
with 32.8 percent variation. Also, (Yusof, Hariri, Mohamed,
& Taheer), investigate the impacts of top management support
towards the adoption of the digital payment system in
Malaysian SMEs. The study directed to 121 employees of
the different business sectors. The findings of the study include
significant impacts of top management support. In addition,
(Ifinedo, 2012), found the significant relationship between
top management support and intention to use digital payment
system. Yet, this study suggested the following hypothesis;
H2: Organizational construct has significant effects on the
use of digital payment systems in developing countries.
2.2.3Environmental Construct
This construct includes the determinants that come from
outside the firms. It mainly includes the competitor,
government regulations, competitive industry, supplier,
customer, and society at large. This study includes social
influence and competitive pressure as an essential factor to
affect the adoption of the digital payment system in SME’s
in developing countries (Xena & Rahadi, 2019). (Igudia, 2017),
scholarship reflected that pressures from trading partners,
suppliers, and competitors affect the adoption and use of
digital payment systems in SMEs. According to (Musa, Khan,
& AlShare, 2015), Social influence is defined as the “degree to
which an individual perceives that importance of other’s belief
that he or she should use the technology.” (Hidayanto et al.,
2015), studied the effects of several factors and behavioral
intentions in the e-payment system. The study analyzed the
203 Indonesian customers and found a significant relationship
between social influence and intention to use the digital
payment system. (Fatonah et al., 2018), also showed the
positive effects of social influence on the use of a digital
payment system. Therefore, the following hypothesis
proposed;H3: Environmental construct has significant effects on the
use of digital payment systems in developing countries.
2.2.4Use of digital payment system and SME’s
performance
Admittedly, none of an economy can grow in the
international market without emerging a flexible and proper
platform for competition, particularly in commerce and trade
through electronic business and commerce. Henceforth, SME’s
in developing countries must move on from paper-based
payment systems to a digital payment system, which enables
them to compete with multinational companies inside and
outside the boundary (Chaffey, Hemphill, & Edmundson-
Bird, 2019). (Nyaga, 2017), the study found the significant
influence of mobile money services on SME’s performance in
Kenya. Besides, (Scott, Van Reenen, & Zachariadis, 2017),
investigate the effects of the adoption of SWIFT on bank
performance. The little studies conducted to investigate the
influence of the digital payment system on SME’s
performance. Therefore, the following hypothesis proposed;
H4: The use of the digital payment system has significant
effects on the use of the digital payment system in developing
countries.
3.METHODOLOGY
3.1Sample size and Data Collection
This study employed the definition of small and medium
enterprises as per the recommendation of Ghana statistical
service “if any of the firm having the number of employees
between 1 and 5 it is called micro, 6 and 30 named small, 31
and 100 called medium, more than 100 named large
enterprises.” (Amoah & Amoah, 2018). The sample size of
the study randomly selected after accumulating data from the
Ghana business directory and popular portals such as
(Business, 2019; Ghana, 2019). Both portals list the number
of SMEs registered and their website information. After,
accumulation of SMEs information, key respondents of the
study targeted includes managers, and executive, with the
hopes that they are more knowledgeable and hold relevant
information about the company and the fluctuation in the
market (Bergeron, Dubois, Dumont, Dial, & Skrobik, 2001).
The self-administered closed-ended questionnaire used to
collect responses. An online survey issued to 650 respondents
by creating online google form. An Email, invitation were
sent to all the respondents, which contain all information
regards to the questionnaire and code of ethics that their
information would remain anonymous confidential and
voluntary (Ahmad et al., 2019). The online survey is generally
used to accumulate more information and to reach a scattered
population (Kuila, Dhanda, Joardar, Neogy, & Kuila, 2019).
In order to ensure the validity and relevance of the survey, an
opinion has been sought from two experts based in Ghana.
The survey instrument has been structured in two parts. The
first part of the questionnaire contains the respondent’s general
information, and the second part contains the construct
question employed in the study.
3.2Measurement Instrument
This study used a well-established scale to measure the
constructs. For the assessment of technological construct,
two dimensions used the ease of use and relative advantage.
For the assessment of ease of use four items taken from the
study (Özkan et al., 2010). The relative advantage assessed
by five items adapted from the study of (Johnson, Kiser,
Washington, & Torres, 2018). Organizational construct
evaluated by using top management support, four items usedGyamfi-Yeboah Kwabena, Mei Qiang, Li Wenyuan, Sikander Ali Qalati & Daria ErusalkinaSJIF Impact Factor(2019) : 8.045|| DOI:10.36713/epra2012 e-ISSN : 2347 - 9671| p- ISSN : 2349 - 0187 Volume - 7,  Issue- 12, December 2019|

three items used to evaluate the social influence items for the
construct taken from (Junadiª, 2015), moreover the
competitive pressure assessed by three items adapted from
(Ahmad et al., 2019). In order to measure the use of the digital
payment system four items taken from the study (Ifinedo,
2012). For the assessment of SME’s performance six items
borrowed from the (Cao, Ajjan, Hong, & Le, 2018; Odoom,
Anning-Dorson, & Acheampong, 2017; Parveen, Jaafar, &

4.2Analytical Tool
Present study data collected through an online survey
after screening out of invalid respondents analyzed by
employing partial least square structural equation modeling
(PLS-SEM). Both approached confirmatory factor analysis
and structural equation modeling administered to test theappropriated model. The approach of CFA utilized to test
convergent validity and reliability of the construct, items
having a value less than 0.5 eliminated from the construct
(Joseph F Hair, Risher, Sarstedt, & Ringle, 2019). PLS-SEM
is used in several disciplines, for instance, social science (Joe
F Hair Jr, Matthews, Matthews, & Sarstedt, 2017),83 EPRA International Journal of Economic and Business Reviewpsychology (Willaby, Costa, Burns, MacCann, & Roberts,
2015), medicine (Berglund, Lytsy, & Westerling, 2013). The
acceptability of PLS-SEM is growing for the last two decades.
4.2.1Assessment of measurement Model
The measurement model evaluates individual item
reliability, internal consistency, convergent validity, and
discriminant validity. (Joseph F Hair Jr, Hult, Ringle, &
Sarstedt, 2016), suggested that the individual item reliability
should be retained between 0.40 and 0.70, as shown in table
2 it lies between 0.661 and 0.947. Furthermore, (Nunnally,
1978), recommended that Cronbach’s alpha (CA) must be
higher than 0.70. Moreover, the assessment of internalconsistency reliability (Bagozzi & Yi, 1988), recommended
that composite reliability (CR) of the construct should be
higher than 0.70. This study’s results of CR lies between
0.894 and 0.971. While, for the assessment of convergent
reliability (Fornell & Larcker, 1981), suggested that the average
variance extracted (AVE) should be equivalent or exceeds the
0.5. Henceforth, as shown in Table 2, it retained between
0.609 and 0.894. Besides, for the assessment of discriminant
validity (Fornell & Larcker, 1981), proposed that the square
root of AVE of each construct must be higher than the inter-
correlation of the variable used in the model. As shown in
table 3. Given the facts shown in the table 2 and 3, this study
adequately satisfied the standards.

4.2.2Assessment of structural model
The structural model assessed through the co-efficient
of determination and hypotheses testing. (Wong, 2013),
recommended that the structural model employed to measure
the linear regression effects of the dependent variables. This
study used PLS to find the path co-efficient, p-value, and co-
efficient of determination. (Cohen, 1998), recommended that
value of R2 0.60, 0.33, and 0.19 respectively named
substantial, moderate, and weak. As shown in table 4 value of
the coefficient of determination for the use of the digital
payment system was 0.545, which indicates that 54.5% ofchanges in the use of digital payment occur due to constructs
used in the study.
Moreover, the 45.7% changes in SME’s performance
occurs due to the technological, organizational, environmental,
and use of digital payment system. Henceforth, given the fact
displayed in table 4, the structural model results fall under
the shadow of a moderate range  (Joe F Hair, Ringle, & Sarstedt,
2011). Furthermore, as shown in table 5 and figure 2, the four
hypotheses constructed supported based on the level of
significance 0.05, and the beta value of 0.676 reveals that the
use of the digital payment system has more significant effects
on SME’s performance operating in Ghana.

5.DISCUSSION
The outcome of this study found interesting, and very
few scholars tested the employed constructs, and the model
tested. In particular, several technologies adopted and used
by SME’s in developing, for instance, cloud computing, e-
commerce, social media, enterprise resource planning system,
web sharing facilities, and so on. While, the use of a digital
payment system found unpredictable in SME’s of developing
countries, especially Ghana.
The technology construct found relevant in the decision
of SMEs to use the digital payment system (p-value=0.013).
The most SME’s prime to use the digital payment system
due to the cumulative benefits it offers, for instance, ease of
use and relative advantage. The research findings are consistent
with (Johnson et al., 2018).
Organizational construct has significant effects on the
use of a digital payment system (p-value=0.000). In particular,
most of the studies showed a positive association in the
adoption and use of digital payment systems in SME’s
decision. This result finding is consistent with (Ifinedo, 2012).
The results indicate that SMEs in Ghana has a higher level of
top management support to use the digital payment system.
Environmental construct also found a critical construct
to affect the use of the digital payment system (p-
value=0.001). The result of the study found consistent with
previous studies of (Igudia, 2017; Xena & Rahadi, 2019).
The result reveals that society at large and competitor pressure
has effects on the use of a digital payment system. Due to the
growing trend of online buying, trade, and shift from onecountry to another, pressurize SMEs to use the digital
payment system.
Interestingly, this study tested the effects of the use of
the digital payment system on SME’s performance in
developing countries more profoundly in Ghana. The little
construct available in existing literature related to effects of
the digital payment system on SME’s performance, even
though the other technologies’ effects were tested, such as
the adoption of social media on SME’s performance. Though,
most of the scholars used constructs to assess the intention
of the use of the digital payment system such as (Özkan et
al., 2010; Sidek, 2015). Henceforth, the contribution of this
