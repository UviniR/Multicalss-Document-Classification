, which leverages an integrated and 
foundations-based diagnostic framework to examine the present level of digital economy development 
across Africa. The assessment maps the current strengths and weaknesses that characterize the 
national digital economy ecosystem in Burundi as well as identifies the challenges and opportunities 
for future growth.  
, permeating virtually every sector 
and aspect of daily life – changing the way we learn, work, trade, socialize, and access public and 
private services and information. In 2016, the global digital economy was worth some USD 11.5 
trillion, equivalent to 15.5 percent of the world’s overall Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It is expected 
to reach 25 percent in less than a decade, quickly outpacing the growth of the overall economy. 
However, countries like Burundi are currently capturing only a fraction of this growth potential and 
need to strategically invest in the foundational elements of their digital economy to keep pace, and 
avoid being left behind. 
  
The overarching analytical framework that shapes this assessment is guided by the premise that 
create the building blocks for unlocking digital transformation in 
Burundi, and thus determine the country’s ability to build a robust digital economy:  
 
1.  that provides the means for people, businesses, and government to get 
online, and subsequently access local and global digital services, thus effectively embedding users 
in the global digital economy. Broadly speaking, digital infrastructure consists of high-quality, 
accessible and affordable connectivity services, but also includes internet of things and data 
centers, as well as institutions and rules that foster a competitive telecommunications market.  
2.  that support the creation of a digitally savvy workforce. These are critical to building 
a robust and competitive digital economy, where innovative services, industries and business-
models can emerge. Broad-based digital literacy and basic skills acquisition are instrumental to 
supporting wide adoption and use of digital products and services by the average consumer, and 
hence critical to ensuring digital inclusion. However, the level of intermediate, advanced and highly 
specialized digital skills will determine Burundi’s ability to embrace digital innovation. 
3. that enable digital transactions and exchange, support new digital businesses 
and service delivery models. Related systems, applications and services thus have the power to 
transform the way people, government, businesses and civil society interact with each other in all 
aspects of life. Digital platforms help create economies of scale and leverage network effects to 
create value and support productivity gains. 
4.  (DFS) that provide individuals and households with convenient and 
affordable means to pay, as well as to save and borrow, using digital tools and platforms. Firms 
can leverage DFS to transact more easily with their customers and suppliers, as well as to build 
digital credit histories allowing access to finance. Governments can use DFS to increase efficiency 
and accountability in various payment streams, including for the disbursement of social transfers 
and receipt of tax payments. Digital payments are often the entry point for DFS and provide the 
“rails” through which additional products and use-cases can be developed. 
5.  and innovation ecosystem that helps bring the digital economy to life 
and accelerate digital transformation – with both young ventures and innovators helping to 
generate new products and services that leverage technologies and digitally-enabled business 
models, as well as traditional industries adopting related solutions – contributing to net 
employment, enhanced competitiveness and productivity. Digital entrepreneurship thus helps 
expand products and services on offer but can also create new markets.   In addition, several  shape these foundational elements, which 
determine Burundi’s ability of create an enabling institutional and policy environment. A clear strategy 
and strong leadership are both needed to spearhead the agenda at national level. Equally, the digital 
economy creates new legal and regulatory challenges, such as protecting consumers and their right 
to privacy, supporting cybersecurity and data protection, as well as effective taxation and competition, 
which need to be effectively addressed to ensure that innovative services continue to emerge, and 
guarantee their safe and affordable access. Moreover, for all Burundians to reap the digital dividends 
associated with the digital economy, it needs to be inclusive to ensure that anyone, regardless of age, 
gender, income and geography has the ability to access digital tools and services. 
 
 
 
. As part of the DTS, ambitious, high-level targets 
have been established for all five foundational pillars of the digital economy, articulated in the DE4A 
assessment framework, as a way to define and measure success against the overarching goal of 
ensuring that every individual, business and government is digitally enabled by 2030. Many of these 
targets have in turn been embedded in the World Bank Group’s IDA19 Commitments.

Analysis presented also draws on , based on standardized 
indicators that form part of the DE4A diagnostic methodology. The analysis also draws on government 
statistics and data shared by the private sector. 
 
 
Given the nascent state of Burundi’s digital ecosystem, there is a paucity of reliable data across the 
board, in relation to the digital economy. The report thus draws heavily on data shared by stakeholders 
consulted. The diagnostic also draws on others past World Bank diagnostics undertaken, wherever 
possible, to avoid interview fatigue.

   COVID-19 has highlighted the need for accelerating digital adoption in Burundi . Ultimately, low digital 
adoption means that the country is ill-equipped to leverage digitally enabled social distancing policies. 
Moving forward, prioritizing measures that increase digital adoption will help boost Burundi's resilience 
to future crises. Greater digital adoption would, for example, allow for economic exchange to continue 
to take place via e-commerce and digital payments, reducing market disruption, support business 
continuity through home-based work, and support continued delivery of critical basic services such as 
distance learning and e-health systems.  
 
Increasing internet access and supporting greater uptake remains the most pressing priority, and the 
first step, to accelerating digital transformation in Burundi. According to GSMA, Burundi’s unique 
mobile broadband penetration rate is just 13.2 percent; there is a need to ensure that its population 
is equipped with the connectivity, devices and skills to fuel widespread adoption of digital technology. 
In 2020, Burundi’s smartphone penetration rate remains low, with device cost a key factor. With 90 
percent of its population dependent on the agriculture sector, and 87 percent living in rural areas, 
efforts to boost digital adoption need to focus heavily on expanding access in rural areas. In addition, 
currently, digital skills and local capacity for distance learning remain low. While the use of digital 
payments is growing, there is ample scope for scaling up contactless digital transactions and G2P 
payments to low-income households and front-line public worker s. Furthermore, in the face of 
restrictions on movement and physical contact, Burundi requires robust e-government capabilities to 
guarantee the continued delivery of critical services. 
 
Burundi’s current sectoral strategies acknowledge the importance of investing in digital technology. 
However, these lack an overarching approach with an actionable roadmap and clear resources behind 
it. Digital transformation requires high-level political leadership, and effective institutional coordination 
across Government and the wider ecosystem. The digital economy in Burundi is characterized by poor 
coordination between stakeholders and a lack of key regulations, making it unconducive to supporting 
digital adoption and private sector-led innovation on a larger scale. Improving inter-ministerial 
coordination and enforcing a whole-of-government approach at the highest level of Government, while 
seizing collaboration opportunities at the regional level will be key to ensuring that Burundi can 
capitalize on the benefits stemming from greater digital adoption. 
 
Burundi’s mobile network coverage and mobile broadband uptake continues to be characterized by a 
stark urban-rural divide . While recent World Bank support has enabled the roll-out of a national 
backbone network, lowering wholesale prices and enabling growth in the telecommunications sector, 
there are sizable gaps in last-mile supply networks currently provided by four competing mobile 
network operators in the market. This prevents many users from gaining access. Internet speeds are 
slow, with 66 percent of connections on 2G, and there is a significant gender gap in access. Improving 
universal coverage will require a coordinated effort and a strong push to ensure that no one is left 
behind. With over 70 percent of the population living with less than USD 1.90 per day and the 
inadequate state of rural infrastructure, there is a need to stimulate the market from both the demand 
and supply sides, with a heavy focus on rural connectivity expansion. Additionally, as a landlocked 
country, Burundi would benefit from the entry of independent wholesale broadband operators and the 
creation of a local data center market, in order to reduce the price of international connectivity. 
 
A series of regulatory issues hamper the development of a more competitive telecoms market in 
Burundi; to unlock further growth, these must be tackled head on. Further regulatory action is needed 
to tackle existing exclusivity provisions, which result in de facto monopolies in some market segments, 
high taxation and a growing tendency for vertical market integration. The use of private gateways has 
had an adverse impact on both the voice and data market. Moreover, there is growing concern from 
internet service providers, that the state-backed backbone operator, BBS, initially designated as a 
wholesale provider, is now also competing in the retail data segment, contrary to its founding charter. 
    Digital skills development is a key part of Burundi’s 2020 education strategy. It is now crucial that the 
education line-ministries’ strong commitment to this agenda is operationalized and implemented in 
practice. Stronger inter-ministerial coordination is required to address the gaps in the education 
system and ensure that key enablers are in place – internet, devices, and electricity etc. – that would 
allow digital skills to be embedded in the education system. While foundational digital skills are 
formally mandated at both lower and upper secondary school level, few schools are able to deliver 
effectively this training. At present, there is no data collection system in place to measure the 
availability and quality of digital skills training. Burundi’s adult literacy rate of 68 percent suggests 
nevertheless a moderate digital skills gap, as literacy is typically considered a pre-requisite for 
foundational digital skills to allow to use internet and other digital services. However, there is both a 
literacy gender gap and education gender gap – women receive on average 2.7 years of schooling 
compared to 3.6 years for men. According to PASEC 2015, Burundi has some of the best results in 
mathematics for West and Central Africa, but low access to electricity and internet in schools, as well 
as difficulties in finding appropriately trained teachers, constitute key constraints to building out a 
critical base of digital skills for the new generations through the formal education system. Stronger 
linkages with the digital ecosystem innovation community are needed, as well as partnerships with 
telecom firms to expand opportunities for training. Burundi should continue to leverage rapid skilling 
programs through initiatives such as the Digital Skills for Africa. At all levels, both the formal education 
system and alternative delivery models must be applied to build foundational digital skills that are 
needed for all other pillars of the digital economy.  
 
Digital platforms are paramount in connecting people, businesses and the Government – enabling 
both transactions and the exchange of information, goods and services in more efficient and 
convenient ways. In Burundi, digital platforms can be instrumental in connecting rural communities 
with urban hubs, providing new and cost-effective ways to expand service delivery to remote parts of 
the country, as well as connecting rural farmers to global value chains and markets.  
 
On the public sector side, ensuring a whole-of-government approach to its early-stage e-Government 
initiatives will be critical.  The current systems introduced are fragmented, characterized by the use of 
incompatible systems and inconsistent standards, limiting prospects for greater interoperability. 
Moreover, access to information and capacity for e-service delivery also need to be improved. The 
Government has developed an emerging online presence, but it is largely restricted to offering 
“information-as-a-service” through a handful of informational websites. Focus on back-end system has 
generated few front-facing services.  
 
The use of digital platforms in the private sector is very low  and primarily revolves around solutions for 
digital payments, with minimal success for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) to date. 
Challenging last mile logistics, low user awareness and confidence, and low transaction volumes also 
pose significant challenges for incoming private sector platforms. In general, oversight and regulation 
to mitigate risks around data protection, privacy and market concentration are needed, alongside 
efforts to ensure that Burundi’s digital divide is not exacerbated.  
 
While Burundi’s levels of financial inclusion are among the lowest in SSA, there has been recent 
developments in Digital Financial Services, due to an expansion in mobile money services and 
enabling regulatory reforms, as well as a relaxing of provisions for related services. At present, mobile 
money services are largely limited to person-to-person (P2P) transfers, Cash-In-Cash-Out (CICO), 
airtime purchase and other payments. There are opportunities to scale up G2P payments and leverage 
development partners’ programs to mainstream digital payment solutions. However, significant 
constraints exist, including access to mobile devices and  effective safeguards.  
 
At present Burundi’s Digital Entrepreneurship sector remains embryonic, hampered by barriers such 
as limited ecosystem support and weak access to financing. There is currently just one tech hub, with 
limited resources to attract and support innovators. Burundi’s population has had little exposure to 
digital solutions, and limited digital adoption has created a very small addressable market of digitally 
savvy consumers. Many entrepreneurs are diaspora, attempting to foster a culture of innovation in 
Burundi. Low-quality and expensive connectivity is a major barrier in developing digitally enabled 
businesses. Weak access to early stage financing, leaves would-be entrepreneurs grasping for support  from international donors or make them quickly disappear from the market. There are almost no 
dedicated strategies, programs or regulations to accompany digital transformation in the private 
sector. 
 
By supporting greater productivity and market-linkages, digital technology has the potential to 
transform the agricultural sector in Burundi . Currently contributing 29 percent to the nation’s GDP, 
there are encouraging examples of nascent AgTech, but there is scope for further scale-up. Global 
experience suggests that digital technology could significantly increase productivity in agriculture 
through economies of scale, resulting in larger yield and economic benefits. In turn, it could improve 
smallholder farmers’ efficiency and competitiveness by reducing the costs associated with linking 
producers and buyers; lessening information asymmetry between smallholder farmers and 
middlemen, and helping farmers make more precise decisions on resource management.  
 
Given its small market size, Burundi would benefit greatly from the establishment of a Single Digital 
Market (SDM) in East Africa , allowing it to become part of a deeply integrated and dynamic digital 
investment, innovation and trade hub . Burundi should be at the forefront of efforts to create a larger, 
digital market in the region; such an initiative would  both help decrease the costs for digital services 
for local consumers, by increasing competition, but also create room for Burundian digitally enabled 
firms to quickly scale in a larger regional market. A competitive regional digital ecosystem can drive a 
reinforcing cycle of economic growth, investment, innovation, job creation, and improved service 
delivery. 
 
Whether through the provision of citizen-centric digital public services or increased digital financial 
inclusion or a dynamic digital innovation ecosystem, there is a breadth of opportunities that can stem 
from incrementally supporting Burundi’s digital transformation. However, to date, progress has been 
slow, constrained by the lack of strong central leadership of the digital agenda, a lingering urban- rural 
digital gap, and a lack of cohesive strategies by donors. Through a whole-of-government approach, 
overarching and operationalized digital transformation strategies and improved rural access, digital 
transformation can be fostered. Developing this capacity will require a series of cross-cutting efforts 
in order to enhance human capital both in the public and private sectors, and align the interests of all 
citizens, businesses and government stakeholders in Burundi.

The Republic of Burundi (Burundi) is a small, landlocked and densely populated country located in 
East Africa, in the heart of the Great Lakes region  (Table 1.1). Burundi shares borders with Rwanda to 
the north, Tanzania to the east and south, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to the west. It 
is the third most densely populated country in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) with an estimated 435 
inhabitants per km² for the population of 11 million people. It is also the least urbanized country in 
SSA, with only 13 percent of the population residing in urban areas. Ensuring that Burundi’s large rural 
communities are connected will thus be critical to supporting digital inclusion. Moreover, Burundi’s 
population is growing rapidly, at more than 3 percent per year and is expected to double by 2040 – 
creating a growing demographic burden and youth bulge.1  
 
In 2020, the UN estimates that 64 percent of the population is less than 24 years old. This burgeoning 
youth population needs to be equipped with the requisite skills and tools to pursue job opportunities 
and thrive in tomorrow’s digital economy. However, present enrollment and completion rates, as well 
as quality of education, hamper learning outcomes across the board, making supporting this transition 
a lingering challenge. Based on 2014 figures from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS), a mere 11 
percent of the population (aged 25 and older) had completed primary education. While interest in 
technology among young people is anecdotally perceived as being high, Burundi’s youth are far from 
being digitally enabled, as they often lack the means to acquire devices and purchase data services.  
 
Burundi remains one of the poorest countries in the world.  In 2018, its gross domestic product (GDP) 
per capita was a low USD 271, placing Burundi at the bottom of the low-income category. Burundi had 
the fourth highest poverty headcount in 2014, with an estimated 72.9 percent living below the poverty 
line of USD 1.90 per day - nearly double the average for SSA and low-income countries. This translates 
to weak purchasing power, that typically has a ripple effect on access to technology.

Agriculture is the bulwark of Burundi’s economy.  The agriculture and forestry sector represented 29 
percent of the country’s GDP and a striking 92 percent of total employment in 2018, making Burundi 
the most dependent country on this sector in SSA, and highly vulnerable to price fluctuations. 
Economic diversification and agriculture productivity gains thus both emerge as key strategic priorities

and Boost Sustainable Growth. Systematic Country Diagnostic. 
for the structural transformation of the country. With limited application of agriculture technology, land 
degradation and climate change place pressure on arable land, which has resulted in yields that fail 
to meet domestic demand. Burundi continues to have one of the highest rates of stunting in the world, 
affecting more than 55 percent of children under five years old.2 The potential role that technology 
could play in supporting the agriculture sector development is discussed further in In-Focus Section 2.  
 
Multi-faceted fragility continues to characterize Burundi’s present development trajectory, but this 
should not prevent investment in the digital economy . The World Bank (WB) Fragility, Conflict and 
Violence (FCV) strategy highlights the powerful impact that digital technology adoption can have in FCV 
settings like Burundi.3 Burundi’s fragility stems from a range of political, climatic and economic drivers 
that often are heavily intertwined and mutually reinforcing.   
 
The 2015 political crisis interrupted a decade of growth and development, and severely impacting the 
business environment.  Domestic demand for goods and services slumped amidst acute insecurity – 
real GDP declined by 3.9 percent in 2015 and decreased by a further 0.6% in 2016, only starting to 
rebound in 2017. Fiscal deficit has remained a challenge, sitting above 5percent of GDP in 2016, 
creating real pressure on the Burundi Franc. This crisis has resulted in a refocus of aid on emergency 
response in lieu of external budget support and the continual aid injection that urban economy 
depends on.4 Undesirable weather patterns affecting agricultural crops and energy supplies have 
severely impacted the living standard of the population. 
 
Whether through the provision of public services closer to its citizens with digital platforms, or through 
increased financial inclusion enabled by digital financial services and dynamic digital ecosystems, 
Burundi stands to gain from a continued investment in the foundations of its digital economy.  However, 
the country faces significant demand-side constraints, due to the low-income level, weak digital literacy 
and challenges in supporting universal access on the supply side.  
 
 
A snapshot of Burundi’s digital ecosystem illustrates that the country presently only has nascent digital 
capabilities:  
 
 Digital Infrastructure:  While the roll-out of a national fiber optic backbone network has helped 
bring thousands within closer proximity to broadband, gaps in last-mile supply networks still 
prevent many users from gaining access, translating into modest internet penetration figures. 
According to the ARCT, in Q4 2019 the penetration of fixed and mobile internet was respectively 
0.04 and 9.68 percent, although 2020 GSMA figure are higher (13.2 percent unique mobile 
internet subscriptions). Most connections are on 2G speeds, which are not fast enough to 
develop advanced digital solutions. Ensuring effective market competition and regulatory 
transparency remains a challenge, in addition to stimulating higher demand. 
 
 Digital Skills are limited by weak digital literacy, a key demand-side barrier that prevents wider 
access to digital tools and services, alongside other factors such as device and services 
affordability, and access to local and relevant content.  The availability and quality of local digital 
skills training that supports more advanced and highly specialized digital skills is also limited, 
yielding a weak pipeline of digital talent. While the education sector is in the process of adopting 
new strategies to leverage information and communication technology (ICT) and enhance

 education delivery, it faces structural constraints such as the lack of qualified teachers, lack of 
equipment and access to electricity in schools, as well as the absence of data and knowledge 
on digital skills levels and labor markets priorities.  
 
 Digital Platforms: Advanced data-driven solutions are yet to fully penetrate the public and private 
sectors. While the Government has established a nascent online presence, there is no roadmap 
to implement a whole-of-government approach to e-government and invest in core shared 
infrastructure and services that supports movement to transactional and integrated e-service 
delivery. As a result, Government online services scored 29.9 out of 100 in the 2018 UN E-
Government Development Index. On the private sector side, digital e-commerce platforms and 
new data-driven business models struggle with sustainability; with most closing down after a 
few years in action. The country ranked second to last (in 150th place out of 152) in the recent 
2019 UNCTAD B2C e-commerce Index.  
 
 Digital Financial Services:  Similar to digital skills, data on Digital Financial Services (DFS) in 
Burundi is largely outdated: the latest Findex survey was carried out in 2014. Based on this 
data, Burundi still appear to have one of the lowest levels of financial inclusion in SSA, with only 
6.9 percent of adults reportedly owning a bank account. Mobile money uptake, while growing, 
is yet to translate to universal financial inclusion and wider access to digital services. Several 
operators exist on the market, but the products offered do not necessarily match the needs of 
low-income customers. The Central Bank recently passed a law to create a special status for 
payment service providers (PSP), recognizing the critical role that non-banks can play in rolling 
out DFS. 
 
 Digital Entrepreneurship.  Despite a small group of startups and a very active incubator, BujaHub, 
there is no critical mass of digital entrepreneurs in Burundi. This market segment is much 
impacted by the high cost of electronic equipment and data, as well as the small market that 
currently exist for those potential digital solutions. Most entrepreneurs face difficulties in 
accessing credit and resort to startup competitions, which are still minimal at the national level. 
At present Burundi has no solutions for innovative financing such as venture capital or business 
angels. Therefore, while a small group of dynamic and dedicated actors is currently building 
Burundi’s innovation system capacity, the lack of institutional support and financing solutions 
mean that it is difficult for these initiatives to reach a critical scale. 
 
Each chapter that follows starts with a summary of key messages, and concludes with an analysis of 
key strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) as well as summary of main 
recommendations. Chapter 2 reviews cross-cutting factors that affect the strategic, institutional and 
regulatory environment for the digital agenda in Burundi. The report proceeds to explore the five 
foundational pillars of the digital economy, in more depth. Chapter 3 looks at the access, quality and 
usage of digital infrastructure, as well as the dynamics of the connectivity market, including what it will 
take to get more Burundians online. Chapter 4 discusses the current state of digital skills attainment 
and coverage. Chapter 5 analyzes the current application and scope for expanding the use of digital 
platforms – both in the public and private sector. Chapter 6 examines the state and uptake of DFS 
among individuals, businesses and by Government. Finally, Chapter 7 assesses the state of digital 
entrepreneurship and the culture of innovation in Burundi. 
 
The report also highlights a series of in-focus topics on key strategic issues : (1) how Burundi can 
ensure digital inclusion, including how digital access can empower women; (2) what prospects there 
is for leveraging technology in agriculture, and (3) how Burundi could support regional integration to 
accelerate digital transformation, supporting transition towards a single digital market.  
 The report concludes with a discussion of next steps, including a summary of recommendations. These 
recommendations are intended for a wider audience, including government, the private sector and 
development partners. However, report finding are also likely to shape the World Bank Groups 
interventions on related topics moving forward.   
 
 
Supporting digital transformation requires a high-level political commitment and effective institutional 
leadership and coordination across government, and the wider ecosystem.  A clearly articulated and 
shared vision and roadmap for supporting digital transformation needs to be internalized by all, and 
championed by Burundi’s leadership at the highest level. Effective stewardship for the agenda is key, 
including a strong institutional framework with clearly defined roles and responsibilities, where 
responsible institutions / entities are equipped with the adequate (financial and human) resources 
and capacity to effectively execute their mandate(s). Notably, fragmentation in the leadership of the 
ICT function in the public sector is often one of the key obstacles to successful implementation of a 
whole-of-government approach to digital transformation. Burundi’s institutional and strategic 
framework for digitalization can thus be considered just as important to the success of digital economy 
initiatives as the many technical aspects, making it a so-called critical analogue complement. 5  
 
Effective coordination between stakeholders should be supported : Government, the private sector, 
civil society and international partners. International best practices offer two main approaches for 
supporting effective leadership and coordination on the digital agenda.6 
 
1. Entrusting leadership to a supra-ministerial entity. In most cases leadership is conferred to the 
highest political office through the introduction of an agency that reports directly to the President’s 
or Prime Minister’s Office. This model is currently being employed by Brazil, Chile, South Korea, 
Estonia, Luxembourg, Mexico, and Slovakia. This model helps ensure high-level leadership and 
supports centralized strategic coordination. Several variations of this approach exist depending on 
the degree of involvement of other ministers. 
 
2. Strategic coordination steered by a lead ministry.  This model is currently being employed by 
Belgium, the People's Republic of China, Japan, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia and Rwanda. Here too, 
there are several variants depending on the nature of the ministry in charge of this coordination: 
exclusively in charge of digital, having other areas of responsibility, or sharing its prerogatives with 
several other ministries.

 
 The choice of the best configuration depends on local and contextual specificities – including available 
institutions and their capacity, administrative culture etc.  In Burundi, it will crucial to decide which 
approach is the best fit, as presently there is both a supra-ministerial entity and a line ministry level 
active in the digital space, as outlined below.  
 
While Burundi is rolling out its digital vision at the sectoral level, there is no integrated approach to 
bring together the various constituencies of the Government.  Coordinating digital transformation 
across Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDA) is essential to maximizing the benefits of digital 
solutions pertaining to the real-time transfer of information, build-up of interoperable and shared 
services, and future implementation of data-driven services that can improve citizen-centric service 
delivery and promote efficient government operations using digital. This section explores the current 
institutional framework by looking at the strategies currently in place, which institutions are in charge 
of implementing them and what laws and regulations that have been enacted to operationalize these 
programs. 
 
The strategic framework presently guiding Burundi’s digital transformation can be found in two high-
level documents: the National ICT Development Policy7 and the National Development Plan8.  
 
The National ICT Development Policy 2010-2025 – “Politique Nationale de Développement des 
Technologies de l’Information et de la Communication” (PNDTIC 2010-2025) – is the first and only 
strategic document to focus solely on how to support wider adoption of modern technology in a cross-
cutting way.  The Policy is remarkably ambitious for a document initially prepared in 2010 – however, 
as demonstrated in this report, it remains largely aspirational; it aims for Burundi emerge as a “center 
of excellence” and a “regional reference in the ICT sector” by 2025. The Policy places the digital 
transformation strategy in the remit of the Ministry of Youth, Posts and ICT (MoYPICT) and reaffirms 
the role of key implementing agencies, including the Executive Secretariat of ICT (SETIC), the National 
Commission for Information Society (CNSI) and the Directorate General of ICT within the MoYPICT.  
 
The PNDTIC includes 73 different priorities, under 10 strategic headings, and  targets cross-cutting 
topics such as infrastructure, e-Government, private sector development in agriculture, industry and 
tourism, social development, research and development, digital finance and rural connectivity. 
Unfortunately, the institutions in charge of implementing the PNDTIC lack the capacity to do so, and 
most key performance indicators set are yet to be achieved (Table 2.1). The Policy also lacks a clear 
implementation roadmap to operationalize many of the proposals made.

In addition, Burundi’s general development objectives in the medium-term are now captured by the 
National Development Plan – “ Plan National de Développement 2018-2027 ” (PND2018-2027).  The 
PND2018-2027 was adopted after the political turbulence of 2015 and is the latest truly cross-cutting 
strategy enacted by the Government. The Plan is centered around the idea of structural transformation 
– a clear fit with the digital economy agenda. However, while this plan acknowledges the role of ICT as 
an important lever in Burundi’s structural transformation, it does not significantly build on the 
propositions of the PNDTIC 2010-2025, nor does it propose an actionable framework to support 
implementation. In fact, the PNDTIC is not referenced at all in Burundi’s PND 2018-2027. 
 
The PND 2018-2028 describes digital technology as a cross-cutting foundational enabler that 
contributes to growth, mainly through human capital development, innovation and productivity gains. 
This plan supports further infrastructure development, including additional roll-out of fiber optic and 
GSM networks. It also aspires to support the promotion of a ‘digital culture’, using both traditional 
media and through a series of sector-specific digital initiatives. These include embedding technology 
in research and innovation, as well as a focus on agricultural, educational, energy and environmental 
sectors. Finally, it endorses wider government digitalization, and inter alia suggests boosting the 
capacities and infrastructure of the National Posts Administration, and supporting the establishment 
of a national center for big data. While the PND 2018-2027 features many positive ideas for the digital 
economy, it is unfortunate that it did not seek to establish clear roles and set out the cross-cutting 
structure that Burundi needs to reap the benefits of digital transformation. 
 
The overall strategies are completed by sectoral strategies, which are listed in Table 2.2 below.  
 
Strategy Description  
ARCT Strategic Plan – 
Plan Stratégique 2016-20209 The ICT industry regulator , ARCT, anchors its 2016-2020 Strategy 
around the concept of developing an inclusive information society. 
It notes that ARCT is transforming along with the ICT sector in 
Burundi. The Strategic Plan notably includes issues related to 
rolling out universal access, provision of operator licenses and 
promotion of fair competition in the telecom market. It highlights 
the need to address regulatory gaps in areas such as data 
protection and cyber -security, which have not yet been addressed.  
Burundi Broadband Strategy – 
Stratégie Burundi Large 
Bande 2025  (BLB 2025) The BLB 2025 was launched in 2017 after a series of lengthy 
consultations - however, many stakeholders believe it still requires 
further review and update. The strategy lacks an actionable 
framework, and does not focus on some key issues, such as 
ensuring universal access or providing additional metro fiber 
networks.

2nd National e -Health 
Development Plan –  
Plan National de 
Développement de 
l’Informatique de Santé 2020-
2024 (PNDIS II)10 The PNDIS II is one of the few sectoral strategies to have been 
adopted and successfully rolled out the use of digital technology 
at a sector level. The plan provides a detailed roadmap for 
implementing data architecture in the health sector, including the 
establishment of a data center within the Ministry of Health, the 
deployment of information systems within hospitals and health 
centers, and the creation of technical support units in the relevant 
institutions.  
National Financial Inclusion 
Strategy (NFIS) 2015-2020 The NFIS was adopted by  the Central Bank of Burundi , focusing on 
plans for financial sector growth, including microfinance, but its 
proposed actions also involve other areas of the economy such as 
increasing access to finance in the agricultural sector. Through 
sub-objective 1.4 that aims to develop financial services through 
mobile phones and other technologies, the NFIS 2015-2020 
broadly recognizes the role of digital financial solution s, 
 
In sum, while reference to the importance of digital technology is made in Burundi’s existing strategic 
frameworks, an actionable digital roadmap is still missing. It is therefore urgent to update the PNDTIC 
2010-2025, adding a clear roadmap for implementation of flagship initiatives across different sectors, 
with clear roles and responsibilities defined. Many key objectives identified remain far from being 
achieved, including universal access to broadband, which points to several underlying issues related 
to poor strategy design and weak political buy-in, but also lack the effective institutional coordination, 
and access to adequate resources to support implementation. Consequently, the absence of a clear 
strategy has had an adverse impact on the effectiveness of the existing institutions, and key MDAs 
lack strategic direction and shared vision.  
 
The institutional framework for the governance of the digital economy is defined by the PNDTIC 2010-
2025, and places it within the realm of four key institutions; MoYPICT, SETIC, ARCT and the CNSI. 
However, the roles of these actors are not necessarily well-defined, and their leadership is not 
acknowledged by sectoral actors. Parties in charge of the centralization of efforts, such as SETIC and 
CNSI, lack resources to enforce their position. 
 
The MoYPICT is the line ministry in charge of providing the Government’s leadership on the digital 
agenda. Previously known as the Ministry of Telecommunication, the Ministry’s revised mandate is the 
result a 2018 reshuffle where the organization and function of the Ministry changed. The line ministry 
is in principle responsible for the development of policy, strategy, law and regulatory pertaining to ICT, 
but has so far produced few key documents that have been formally adopted. 
 
The SETIC is the implementing arm of the line ministry on matters pertaining to ICT.  The entity was 
created through Presidential decree in 2007 and designated as a national authority, charged with the 
implementation of major ICT programs. Its mission includes operationalizing the Government's 
strategy in relation to e-governance, and promoting of ICT in relation to other areas of social and 
economic development, including science and culture. 
 
The ARCT is responsible for regulatory oversight of the ICT market in Burundi.  Its mission is to promote 
public access to quality electronic communication services throughout the territory of Burundi at 
affordable prices and contribute to the development of broadband services necessary for the 
emergence of the digital economy.

_de_Sante_du_Burundi_PNDIS    
The CNSI is responsible for supporting the Government’s coordination, implementation, as well as 
monitoring of the PNDTIC  and was created through a Presidential Decree issued in 2007. The CNSI 
could also play a role in ensuring fair treatment of information, and supporting the Government’s 
programs on data governance and cybersecurity, which are currently missing. At present, the CNSI’s 
role appears to be limited. 
 
As it stands, the implementation of digital by other line ministries is either absent, or piloted using 
siloed approaches.  Some sectors, such as health, have an advanced and in-depth strategy with a clear 
roadmap, however, many key areas such as e-government, e-commerce, digital entrepreneurship and 
innovation lack vision and leadership. Overall, there appears to be limited interaction between the 
general leadership of MoYPICT, and sectoral line ministries where there could be greater synergy, such 
as in relation to the deployment of cross-cutting programs. Among the other MDAs, three appear to be 
in a position to share their experience and support further digital transformation: the Ministry of Public 
Health and Fight Against AIDS (MSPLS), the Central Bank of Burundi (BRB) and the Burundi’s Institute 
of Statistics and Economic Research (ISTEEBU). 
 
The MSPLS initiated the PNDIS II in 2015, and it remains one of the most comprehensive efforts in 
the implementation of digital economy programming in Burundi.  Most medical, administrative and 
technical services of the MSPLS are equipped with computers and basic software. The modern 
systems put in place by DHIS2 and Open Clinic which connect all hospitals and health centers are one 
of the key aspects of the PNDIS, which other institutions can take inspiration from and share lessons 
learnt in rolling out the digital architecture. 
 
The BRB recently passed some key laws and regulations, further discussed in Section 6.2.2.1, to 
enable digital financial services through the provision of a payment service provider license for non-
banks and regulation of the financial agents.  The BRB also helps carry out the Government’s financial 
inclusion strategy through the facilitation of mobile money services, which it has been doing through 
the aforementioned regulation. 
 
ISTEEBU is Burundi’s national statistical office, which launched the Integrated Multi-sectoral 
Information System (IMIS), a nascent open data initiative for economic and sociodemographic data. It 
is a first-of-its-kind initiative in Burundi; while ISTEEBU does not mention open data as part of its 
mission, it has made efforts to make this service available to citizens. However, the use of the platform 
remains limited, due to both limited knowledge of its existence and the quality of the data available. 
Further efforts are needed to improve it, which will require stronger institutional and policy 
coordination from leadership. 
 
The present institutional framework in Burundi is marred by weak inter-agency coordination. As it 
stands, digital transformation efforts are characterized by scattered initiatives across MDAs. Notably, 
efforts to support government digitalization have mirrored the vertical silos of government 
organization, resulting in pockets of progress but marked absence of a whole-of-government approach, 
leading to cost inefficiency and fragmentation. As noted in Section 5.2.2, the Government recently 
implemented the COMGOV network to enable interconnectivity across MDAs, but it is not effectively 
operational in most units. Donors have appeared to sometimes reinforce silos, as they typically 
channel funding to specific sectoral projects, as opposed to supporting cross-cutting interventions.  
 
The absence of clear mandates, but also adequate clout and resources, also appear to be sidelining 
lead institutions . For example, while SETIC is charged with supervising all digital project in government 
in order to achieve greater synergies and resources efficiency, they are typically sidelined by line MDAs. 
It is also unclear what relations CNSI has to the SETIC, where the two agencies appear to have very 
similar and overlapping mandates. While it is encouraging that Government has recognized the need 
for overarching coordination, (resulting in the birth of both CNSI and SETIC), neither appear to be 
fulfilling their roles, as intended. Anecdotal evidence suggested the many MDAs prefer to manage donor projects independently, both due to wider-spread financing gaps in government, but also in the 
hope of personal financial gain. Meanwhile, many of MDSs often lack the necessary skills to support 
the effective implementation of digital initiatives.  
 
Laws that regulate the ICT sector have not kept pace with technology evolutions.  There are no laws in 
place to protect personal data privacy. The MoYPICT has developed a law on electronic 
communications and transactions but it has not yet been promulgated as of March 2020. Broadly 
speaking, Burundi is still characterized by a legal and regulatory vacuum on many cross-cutting issues 
that pertain to the digital economy, which shapes the enabling environment for wider and safe digital 
adoption.  
 
Several regulations exist, including basic licensing to offer data services on digital markets, and PSP 
licenses that allow non-banks to offer DFS to the large unbanked population.  However, the absence 
of a comprehensive regulatory framework at the highest institutional level is a major cross-cutting 
constraint to the development of the digital economy in Burundi. This diagnostic briefly lists some of 
the key regulations currently in effect in Table 2.3 below. Other key regulations are lacking, including 
those on cybersecurity, data protection and access to information, which are essential to the design 
and implementation of a national strategy for the digital economy.  
 
Law, decree or regulation  Description  
Décret N°100/186 d u 16 
octobre 2017 portant création 
et modalités de gestion du 
fonds de service universel des 
TIC au Burundi.11 This presidential decree institutes Burundi’s Universal Service 
Fund (USF) and sets the modalities and priorities for USF projects. 
The USF in Burundi is managed by the MoYPICT and executed by 
the ARCT. However, proceedings since this decree was enacted 
are largely unknown. Stakeholders report that the taxes are being 
collected by ARCT, but there are no reports, nor any data, as to 
what the monies have been used for.  
Règlement N°002/2017 
relatif aux agents 
commerciaux en opérations 
de banque et de services de 
paiement12 This BRB regulation builds on Regulation N°001/2017 below by 
allowing commercial agents to work with the newly regulated PSPs 
as well as banks. Commercial agents are allowed to exercise 
payment and banking activities on behalf of PSPs and banks. They 
must be declared by the PSP or the bank and approved by the BRB.  
Règlement N°001/2017 
relatif aux services de 
paiement et aux activités des 
établissements de paiement13 This BRB regulation creates the status of payment service 
provider, which is a moral person authorized to provide services 
such as: cash transfers and withdrawal from a payment account, 
automatic transfers, pre-paid payment cards, as well as the use of 
electronic money. The regulation is comprehensive and allow PSPs 
to operate without having access to a bank account, which is 
critical in ensuring that DFS can reach the large unbanked 
population.  
Décret n°100/97 du 18 Avril 
2014 portant fixation des

driven value-added services such as e-commerce platforms, direct 
messaging platforms, call centers, virtual social networks, and 
mobile money platforms. Entities interested in entering the market 
must obtain the relevant license from ARCT.

« ARCT »15 This presidential decree reorganizes ARCT to make it one of the 
key actors of the ICT sector in Burundi. It brings it under the 
authority of the Presidency of the Republic and redefines its 
missions, mainly a) to promote universal access to ICT, b) to 
contribute to the emergence of broadband services and the digital 
economy, and c) to optimize the planification and management of 
the telecommunications market.  
Décret–Loi N° 1/011 du 4 
Septembre 1997 portant 
dispositions organiques sur 
les télécommunications16 This decree -law is the organic disposition  for the 
telecommunications market in Burundi. It liberalizes the telecom 
market, at this time mainly around radiocommunication and 
telephony, and created the ARCT.  
 
As noted in Table 2.3, the legal and regulatory framework has progressed slowly and still lacks some 
key enablers. Burundi is the only country in the East African Community (EAC) that does not have a 
specific law on access to information. There are also no specific laws on data archiving or data sharing, 
which severely complicates the development of new data-driven products and services. There are no 
specific laws or regulations to ensure interoperability between government systems, which reinforces 
the siloed architecture of MDAs.  
 
While results are happening at a very localized level, Burundi’s digital transformation strategies lack 
coherence. The strategies in place do not build on each other, institutions’ roles are defined but not 
enforced in practice, and regulations are being rolled out at a pace too slow to benefit digital 
businesses and other content creators in Burundi’s nascent digital ecosystem. This is largely due to 
the low resources available for central institutions like SETIC, and to the connectivity barriers across 
MDAs. Improving inter-ministerial coordination and enforcing a clear whole-of-government vision of 
digital transformation at the highest level of Government will be key to ensure that Burundi can make 
the most of its ongoing efforts of digital transformation. 
 
 The current strategies acknowledge the 
importance  of investing in digital technology 
 Some foundational regulations are 
operational , especially to enable mobile 
payments 
 Institutions exist  for both cross-cutting 
leadership and sectoral expertise  
 There have been good results at the sectoral 
level, especially in health  There is no overarching digital economy 
strategy beyond the PNDTIC, which lacks an 
actionable operational plan. 
 The current institutional framework has 
institutions in place which lack resources and 
legitimacy  
 There are opportunities to leverage lessons 
learnt from sectoral agencies   
 Also opportunities to work with the EAC  and 
adapt legislation passed in other countries  There are important r egulatory and leg al gaps 
on open data, personal data protection and 
cybersecurity.

and citizens for more digital services, which 
indicates a good momentum for the sector nascent, so it is urgent to build up leadership 
for each of these  
 
 
The DE4A Country Diagnostic considers the recommendations below to support digital governance: 
 
 
 
R1. Adopt a new overarching strategic vision for the digital economy. As noted above, the country still 
lacks an actionable strategy to promote the digital economy. This process should convene all key 
stakeholders, allowing the ecosystem to rally around a common vision. An overarching strategic vision 
should clearly enact the high-level priorities and be flexible enough to allow for sectoral sub-strategies, 
which add detail without resulting in siloes. It should provide fora for exchange between institutional 
actors, and allocate resources to give key institutions the means to achieve their objective. 
 
R2. Ensure that the strategy is supported by SMART (specific, measurable, actionable, relevant and 
time-bound) action plans. This will help support more effective implementation than we have 
witnessed to-date. Monitoring the strategy needs take place alongside capacity building for data 
collection and analysis, in order to keep track of key performance indicators. The monitoring approach 
should help to identify institutions in charge and hold them accountable. Indicators part of the 
monitoring should be published on open data sources such as ISTEEBU’s IMIS platform.  
 
 
R3. Clarify institutional mandates. As it stands, Burundi appears to be employing an opaque 
institutional approach. As noted in Section 2.1, government usually resort to one of two institutional 
approaches: a supra-ministerial secretariat of ICT, or a line ministry in charge of the digital economy. 
In Burundi, the ARCT is a supra-ministerial entity, while the SETIC is under the MoYPICT, which is the 
line ministry. There is a need to disentangle this institutional landscape and clearly attribute the roles 
and means to work for each of these institutions. Provided that Burundi plans to roll out a whole-of-
government approach, the supra-ministerial approach would be preferred, and giving this role to SETIC 
rather than ARCT (which is clearly a regulator, but not a coordinator), seems the more appropriate 
option. 
 
R4. Support greater inter-ministerial coordination. Through such supra-ministerial committee, it would 
be easier to support greater communication and collaboration between MDAs. This can take place 
through regular meetings, as well as the establishment of a clear communication infrastructure, for 
example through the COMGOV network (see Section 5.2.2). However, technical solutions, capacity 
building and better equipment needs to be provided to Government officials and public servants in 
order to help everyone connect to and use an integrated network.  
 
R5. Support a platform for ecosystem and donor coordination. This recommendation aims to identify 
a platform for the public sector to systematically engage with its counterparts in the private sector, 
civil society, academia and international development partners on key issues. It could take the form 
of an online platform to collect feedback and interact with partners on key aspects of the digital 
transformation.  
  
R6. Adopt a suite of foundation cyber laws, aligned with global best practice and regional frameworks.  
Aligning regulatory and legal provision will enable regional frameworks, including those adopted by the 
EAC, AU and the European Union (EU). Burundi can support movement toward the regional integration 
of digital markets, for example by allowing cross-border data sharing. Regional integration is explored 
further in In-Focus Section 3, and in boxes 2, 5, 8 and 12 across the report.  
 
R7. Strengthen the capacity of the Regulator and MoYPICT. There is a need to scale up the pace of 
adoption of key regulations and laws for the digital economy.  This is likely to require further capacity 
building and technical assistance, in particular with respect to data-driven services such as big data, 
artificial intelligence (AI) and related matters of data governance and cybersecurity.   
 
 
 
The first step to unlocking digital transformation and the associated digital dividends, is to ensure 
universal, affordable and safe access to internet through greater connectivity. World Bank research 
has demonstrated that increased broadband penetration is associated with high impact on economic 
growth, especially in low- and middle-
income countries.17 Increased 
productivity of the private sector 
would in-turn help lift the Burundian 
economy. The Government would 
also receive a significant boost if 
public systems and delivery platforms 
were digitally robust and brought 
online, enabling greater e-service 
delivery. Similarly, with the means to 
connect, citizens would be able to 
access these services, especially in 
rural areas, as well as participate 
better in the political life of the 
country.  
 
Increasing adoption and utilization of 
internet services among the population remains  critical to building a dynamic digital economy in 
Burundi. While this is a priority embraced by the PNDTIC and Vision 2025 strategies, limited progress

implement digital development efforts in an integrated manner across sectors and pillars of the digital 
economy. The country remains largely behind the continental average on all of the key indicators of 
digital infrastructure, as demonstrated in Table 3.1. 
 
 
 
Mobile broadband network coverage, while improving, is still far from supporting universal coverage. 
According to GSMA, 3G and 4G network covers only 40 and 25 percent of the population respectively. 
This places Burundi at the bottom of SSA rankings (Figure 3.2). Burundi also performs lower than East 
African peers such as Rwanda and Tanzania, where 3G coverage stands at 95 and 67 percent, 
respectively.  
 
 
 
Several factors hamper operators’ ability and willingness to invest in network upgrades and expansion ,  
including an unpredictable regulatory and adverse business environment, meager profit margins 
driven by both high infrastructure deployment and maintenance costs, and weak consumer demand 
especially in rural areas. Burundi’s inherent small market size and user base also limit operators’ 
ability to leverage economies of scale. These issues are discussed further in the sections below.  
 
According to the ITU, the official internet penetration rate, based on mobile and fixed subscriptions 
was just 2.7 percent of individuals.18 Only 0.3 percent of households had wired internet at home, and 
1 percent had a computer at home  in 2017. As in similar markets, connectivity is predominately based 
on mobile broadband; in Q4 2019, 99.6 percent of all internet subscriptions were mobile.19 The rate 
of unique cellular subscriptions stands at 36.8 percent,20 and the level of unique mobile broadband 
subscriptions barely crosses the 10 percent threshold, according to the latest figures from ARCT and 
GSMA.21 Burundi thus ranks below many of its peers in SSA, as depicted in Figure 3.1 below.

20 GSMA Intelligence. 
21 The latest figures from GSMA are noticeably higher than those provided by the ARCT or the ITU. This may be 
due the time difference between sources or to different methodologies. In any case, it is safe to assume that 
internet penetration is on a growing trend in Burundi, as in similar markets. 
 
 
A majority of Burundi mobile subscribers rely predominately on 2G services, with limited applications 
beyond voice-, SMS-based and mobile money services . Out of 7,119,016 total mobile subscriptions in 
Q1 2020, the proportion of 2G, 3G and 4G was respectively 66 percent, 31 percent and 3 percent. 
Each of the four mobile network operators (MNO) indicated that a majority of their subscribers were 
still on 2G networks: 63.6 percent for Smart, 65.8 percent for both Econet and Lumitel, and 100 
percent for Onatel.22 The GSMA’s mobile connectivity index suggests that key reasons for Burundi’s 
limited usage of mobile internet include cost, consumer awareness and literacy (readiness), and 
limited infrastructure. 
 
While broadband penetration rates are modest, uptake does appear to be growing. According to the 
ARCT, mobile broadband penetration rates recorded in Q4 2019 grew 35 percent on the previous year. 
Lumitel indicated a 30 percent increase in 3G subscribers over the same period, whereas Smart 
reported that 3G subscriptions had increased from 50,000 to 125,000 over a two-year period and 
that data consumption had doubled.  Burundi thus appears to be on track to reach the interim goal of 
doubling broadband by 2021. However, starting from a low baseline, the country remains far from the 
more ambitious objective of reaching universal internet access by 2030, and risks falling behind. 
Operators note that growing demand for 3G and 4G services is largely fueled by the urban user base 
and remains weak in rural areas, creating limited incentives for further infrastructure roll-out, as 
discussed in Section 3.2.3.  
 
Uptake of broadband is also constrained by affordability, where Burundi performs poorly in relation to 
global affordability targets. While absolute prices are lower than many other African countries, Burundi 
is far from meeting the UN’s Broadband Commission’s affordability target at 1GB for less than 2 
percent of Gross National Income (GNI) per capita.  The price of 1GB of data as percentage of GNI per 
capita is estimated to be 13.6 percent in Burundi, compared to 3.1 percent in Kenya and 3.4 percent 
in Rwanda (Figure 3.3).23 Prices of mobile broadband have come down significantly following the roll-
out of a national backbone that reduced reliance on expensive satellite services. However, operators 
reported that wholesale prices remain higher than in neighboring countries such as Rwanda and 
Uganda, which is discussed in Section 3.2.3.1 on first-mile connectivity.

23 Alliance for Affordable Internet, Mobile Broadband Pricing, Q2 2019.  
 
 
Driven largely by cost, Burundi’s penetration rate of basic phones, smartphones and internet-enabled 
devices is low. Affordability of devices remains a concern and creates a significant barrier to mobile 
ownership and mobile internet adoption. 
 
Competitive broadband markets lead to more affordable internet access and encourage innovation. 
As of September 2019, there were four MNOs24 and eight fixed internet services providers25 (ISP) in 
Burundi. The newest market entrant Lumitel quickly emerged as an important player in many market 
segments in Burundi making significant investments, including its own middle-mile backbone and 
mobile access networks, providing it with a strong, vertically integrated position in the 
telecommunications market. However, Econet remains leader in the mobile market with a 47.4 
percent market share. Lumitel comes in close second with a 41.8 percent market share, and 
outperforms Econet in the 4G market segment. The remainder of the market is captured by Smart and 
the public telecommunications operator (PTO) Onatel, with 9.9 and 1 percent of market shares, 
respectively (Figure 3.4).26 The fixed line market remains small and dominated by CBINET, whose 
share is around 66 percent of the market according to the regulator.  
 
Gateways and exclusive licenses have exacerbated vertical market integration in certain market 
segments. Examples include the Burundi Backbone System 
(BBS), which was established as an open access wholesale 
operator, but has slowly begun entering the retail market 
(see Box 1). Moreover, two gateways have been introduced 
under exclusive licensing provisions – one for voice and one 
recently for data. A voice gateway license was issued to 
International Telecom Services (ITS) under an opaque 
licensing process. Government recently also decided to 
introduce a gateway for data, which is set to be managed by 
BBS, reinforcing the role of this operator (see Box 4). There 
exists a sentiment amongst private operators, that the 
introduction of these gateways,  undermines future 
investment in the market, negatively impacting new entrants 
in particular. 
 
24 The four MNOs are Econet, Smart, Lumitel and Onatel. 
25 The eight fixed ISPs are CBINET, Spidernet, USAN, LAMI Wireless, NT Global, BBS, Onatel and Lumitel. CBINet 
holds two-third of the market shares of the fixed line internet market.

For developing high-speed internet, the value chain needs to be incrementally built and requires four 
steps that can be undertaken in parallel tracks (Figure 3.5).  This framework was developed in the 
World Bank’s World Development Report 2016 Digital Dividends, based on the four “miles” of internet 
development: 
 
  how internet enters the country . Understanding how Burundi is connected to 
international and regional networks. 
 : how internet passes through the country . Looking at the national backbone, 
related regulation and business practices, as well as Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), 
datacenters/hosting arrangements, etc. 
  how internet arrives at a population center and reaches end-users . Examining local 
access and mobile networks (2G, 3G, and 4G), as well as telecom market dynamics, structure, 
regulation and business practices.  
 : how hidden elements are vital to ensure the integrity of the value chain.  This 
includes cybersecurity and components such as the radio spectrum and network databases. 
This also includes the policy and regulatory aspects governing the market, including those 
related to competition, cybersecurity, spectrum allocation and data protection.  
 
 
 
The migration of backbone connectivity from satellite-based to fiber-based links over the last few years 
have helped to unlock far greater bandwidth than previously available in Burundi. Burundi is currently 
connected to a single submarine cable, the East African Submarine Cable System (EASSy), through six 
cross-border connections with Rwanda and Tanzania. In December 2019, BBS entered in a 10-year 
agreement with Tanzanian firm TTCL to further build connectivity and gain access to the Seacom 
cable.27 It is important to note the landlocked reality of Burundi, which increases reliance on its 
neighbors and can increase the price of international connectivity. 
 
Five ISPs are transporting internet capacity from neighboring countries, but the percentage of capacity 
used is still a fraction of the total available.  As of Q4 2019, Burundi used a capacity of ~2.3 Gb, 
representing 32 percent of the total 7.1 Gb bought by the ISPs. The bandwidth usage per capita (at 
591 bps) is one of the lowest in the world (Figure 3.6). The excess capacity reflects the constrained 
downstream infrastructure, as well as acutely low data demand (driven by low smartphone penetration 
and lack of affordability). Factors that contain demand are discussed further in Section 3.2.4. 
 
27 https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/business/TTCL-to-expand-fibre-optic-cable-to-Burundi/2560-5328308-
90l2b4z/index.html . Accessed on May 31st, 2020. 
 
In addition to capital and operational costs of expenditure, high 
taxes affect wholesale prices which get passed along to 
consumers, resulting in increased retail pricing.  ISPs and MNOs 
can access international connectivity on a wholesale basis from 
BBS (except Lumitel, which operates its own fiber), despite 
gateway issues mentioned above.  
 
Rapid increases in wholesale facilitated by the WB-supported 
National Backbone Network and the construction of Lumitel’s 
network have brought growth to middle-mile connectivity in 
Burundi. The segment is contested by three players: Onatel (the national PTO), the mobile operator 
Lumitel and the wholesale provider BBS. While the government expanded the scope of licenses for 
mobile operators such as Lumitel to deploy their own infrastructure, pure-play ISPs are not allowed 
this flexibility and scope.  
 
Despite having low network coverage, Burundi has one of the highest fiber densities in the region. The 
national backbone managed by BBS consists of 26 regional nodes, connecting 17 administrative 
provinces and a 40Gbps capacity transport platform (upgradeable to 100Gbps) for connectivity to 
international submarine cables. Lumitel has also deployed 3,300km of fiber, covering all 18 provinces. 
In Bujumbura, the PTO Onatel has built out a 200-km metropolitan area network (MAN), while BBS’s 
metro network is 75 kilometers long. Other major municipalities are yet to benefit from the deployment 
of MANs in substantial terms. BBS is implementing a strategy to diversify its revenue from sale of 
wholesale bandwidth to value-added services such as voice over IP (VOIP), video protection and data 
transmission (now accounting for 60 percent of its revenue). Moreover, BBS recently installed Dense 
Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) technology, which helped increase the its internet capacity 
to 4 terabytes of IP transmission. The main customers of BBS are the operators, ISPs, large businesses 
and the government, which buys 100MB for 40 institutions, including 20MB for 10 universities.  
 
 BBS was launched in March 2013 as a consortium of Burundian telecom operators who joined 
forces to build a national fiber optic network, with support from the World Bank.  BBS offers IP 
transit to ISPs, application service providers, content readers and other users requiring high-quality 
performance. Many ISPs have expressed concerns that the recent entrance of BBS into the retail 
market poses a threat to their business model. This vertical integration of BBS happened under 
the aegis of the ICT ministry; reasons cited include the need for additional revenue generation and 
greater acceleration of internet service deployment.  
 
After its entry into the retail segment, data and transmissions now account for 40 percent of BBS’ 
revenue stream.  BBS has one level-3 data center built at a cost of USD2 million. Its business 
strategy is to use the data center to offer value-added products such as hosting – a service aimed 
at localizing web pages and databases. BBS also operates the Burundi Internet Exchange Point 
(IXP) to which many operators already connect but do not pay. The IXP already ensures 60% of 
local internet traffic and provides caching services to companies such as Google, Facebook and 
Akamai.  
 
According to BBS, the principal challenge in growing the last mile to households and businesses 
is the cost of civil works.  BBS systems are prone to vandalism, cuts and theft. Installation comes 
at a high cost – USD 2,000 per kilometer. In addition, BBS is not often consulted when public 
works are being carried, implying that its installations often get tampered with.   
The Burundi Internet Exchange Point (IXP) was created in 
May 2014 to eradicate the problem of local traffic being 
channeled through international connections.  This opened 
new prospects for growth and development, increased 
internet traffic and improvement of the revenue streams of 
all companies concerned. The IXP is managed by BBS and 
supervised by the regulator ARCT, which is responsible for 
guaranteeing fair competition in the telecommunications 
sector by ensuring that all players provide access on a 
transparent and nondiscriminatory basis and adhere to 
requests for interconnection. 
 
Exploitation of new additions to the middle-mile segment 
through massive roll-out of FTTP and other services remains 
a key challenge.  In addition, for both existing and future 
operators that do not have their own network, the 
appropriate regulatory tools to ensure effective, 
nondiscriminatory and fair access to Burundi’s national 
backbone infrastructure need to be in place. 
 
While the notion of a digital economy is still a novel idea in 
Burundi, wholesale demand for internet bandwidth has 
grown to 7 GB out of the available 13.7 GB of combined 
capacity. First-generation ICT reforms and investments 
involving market competition and privatization have led to 
greater access and affordability of mobile internet but have 
been less successful in spreading digital adoption beyond 
the most affluent segments of the population. Much of the 
reason lies in ongoing issues of regulatory capture, low 
purchasing power, high taxation, and lack of competition in 
the international gateway for voice and data markets. 
 
With only 2 percent of rural Burundians having access to electricity, mobile operators have to deploy 
their own energy infrastructure to more rural and remote areas, adding to operating expenses. 
Burundi’s rate of mobile penetration currently 
sits at 36.8 percent, and while it has 
increased over the years, much remains to be 
done to bring the rate on par with the regional 
average. There are four companies licensed 
by the ARCT to offer mobile cellular services. 
The latest entrant, Viettel Burundi, was 
awarded a mobile operating license in 
February 2014, launching in May 2015 under 
the Lumitel Brand. The government 
reportedly charged Lumitel BIF 16 billion 
(more than USD 10 million) for the license, 
well below the original asking price of BIF 60 
billion (around USD 37 million). The growing 
mobile penetration led to mobile money 
being the second most developed use of 
telephony, behind mobile internet, a topic 
further discussed in Chapter 6.  
  
Given its geographical positioning, 
the development of digital 
infrastructure could allow Burundi 
to act as a hub for trade between 
Central Africa and East Africa, and 
between Central and Southern 
Africa.  
 
As one of the five member nations in 
the East African Community (EAC), 
Burundi joined in 2014 the initiative 
to cap minimum roaming charges to 
boost integration with member 
states Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda and 
Tanzania. Under the East African 
Community Interconnections 
Regulations, EAC countries seek to 
implement a regional policy to guide 
service providers and regulators in 
developing tariffs for digital 
connectivity across borders, which 
may provide opportunities to further 
develop its infrastructure. 
  
In 2017, Burundi and DRC signed 
the Boundary Frequency 
Coordination Agreement to “combat 
the illegal commercialization of 
telecommunication products”.   Given that most Burundians access internet via mobile, the low share of mobile users who have 
internet connectivity is a key constraint.  Fixed broadband infrastructure and coverage, while growing, 
are still limited, and when coupled with their relatively high costs, the clearest path for getting more 
Burundians online appears to rely yet on mobile. Enforcing obligations for mobile internet coverage 
and the development of other models to promote affordability for both urban and rural dwellers hold 
valuable promise. 
 
Burundi has a noticeably low penetration of fixed internet at less than 1 percent compared to 1.6 
percent in the region.  Only 0.04 percent of internet subscribers have fixed broadband access at home. 
This low rate reflects the low density of relatively costly fixed access networks and the fact that users 
have found a competitive alternative in the mobile internet packages that are now becoming more 
ubiquitous than 5 years ago. Given the small size of the market, licensing new market entrants such 
as Groupe Vivendi Africa (which is now actively deploying FTTP in many francophone countries) may 
be ambitious. 
 
The biggest push in terms of investment in mobile network expansion has come from the newest 
mobile operator . Lumitel  has rolled out a total of 1,000 base transceiver stations (BTS). In 2019, 
Lumitel registered 53 percent and 38 percent annual growth for 3G and 4G connections, respectively. 
In the same period, Econet registered 37 and 39 percent growth, respectively for 3G and 4G, while 
Smart registered 44 percent growth in 3G connections. 
 
Both mobile network coverage and mobile broadband uptake continued to be characterized by a stark 
urban-rural divide . Smart only provides network coverage in Bujumbura and major towns, and some 
75 percent of the operator’s subscribers are estimated to be in Bujumbura. Consultations with MNOs 
suggest that demand for 3G and 4G in rural areas is weak. Moreover, Burundi’s hilly terrain makes it 
very difficult to build infrastructure, in addition to already high capital and operational costs of 
expenditures that significantly deter incentives to invest. 
 
 
 
In Burundi, any natural or legal entity, national or foreign, can participate in the ICT market, by filing a 
license application and concluding a concession agreement with the Government.  All license 
applications are filed with the industry regulator ARCT, which advises the Office of the President and 
the Government to issue licenses. A concession agreement would then have to be signed between the 
ARTC and the service provider.  A USF was formally established in 2017 and is intended to finance exclusively activities related to 
enabling universal access to ICT services, including the development of the ICT sector and training.  
Its main goals were the provision of public access points for electronic communications services 
throughout the territory; the connection of any person to public networks and access to basic 
electronic communications services; access to emergency services and free information; free 
delivery of emergency electronic communications; implementation of special measures for certain 
social groups; service of uncovered rural areas; development of the disadvantaged sectors of the 
national economy through the use of electronic communications; support for research, training 
and standardization. The USF is entirely funded nationally through a 1 percent tax on the turnover 
of telecom operators, and government grants through the Ministry of ICT. 
 
Consultation with USF management suggest that the USF is focused on expanding community 
telecentres, which once established are run by community non-profits on a voluntary basis.  Four 
centers already exist and another ten are being added in 2020. While authorities claim that these 
centers are well-used, the global evidence-base questions the efficacy of the telecentre model.  
 
To date, the USF scheme has far from achieved its goals.  Industry interviews indicate that there is 
significant room for improving operations of the fund.  The Ministry of Posts, Information Technology, 
Communication and Media has overall authority for the 
sector and carries out its directives through ARCT.  A draft 
law governing electronic communications and providing a 
new telecoms regulatory framework, is still in draft and is 
yet to be promulgated. The lack of new regulatory 
framework for the industry is causing regulatory 
uncertainty for operators and ISPs, delays potential 
revenues for the public treasury and limits the potential of 
the overall digital economy in Burundi.  
 
Taxation is another big issue in Burundi, one of few 
countries where the government levies a special voice tax.  
The telecom sector is not only subjected to VAT, but also 
to a special 52 BIF tax charge on voice and an 18 percent 
VAT on data – effectively a double taxation system in 
Burundi’s telecom sector. In addition, the sector suffers a 
double impact of VAT – input VAT and output VAT. The 
input VAT is meant to be netted off against the output VAT 
but because the government taxation system is not robust 
enough, operators find it difficult to get reimbursed the 
input VAT. ISPs pay USD10K levy regardless of turnover in 
addition to a 4 percent tax on turnover and a 1 percent 
charge on turnover for USF contribution. Taxations of 
incoming and outgoing international calls has had a 
detrimental impact on this revenue stream for both 
operators and government, leading international voice 
traffic to virtually disappear.  
 
There is a general drift towards less competition in the 
Burundian ICT market. Large scale controls with opaque 
governance and no arbitration process have been rolled 
out since June 2019. Yet markets with healthy and 
competitive broadband actors also lead to better 
outcomes on data protection and cybersecurity, an issue 
which needs to be seized by the regulator ARCT or the 
Ministry of ICT. Despite price promotions, the market 
position of smaller mobile operators and of the five 
internet service providers are subsequently being 
weakened, and operators’ margins are thinning and prices 
(in relative terms) remain stubbornly high (for most of the 
population). 
 
Both the growing inclination towards high taxes and 
market concentration are epitomized by the introduction 
of two gateways – both of which have been introduced to 
secure tax revenue and under exclusive licensing 
provisions (see Box 4).  
 
Support for regional integration of infrastructure markets 
could help infuse more competition in the Burundi, in favor 
of lower rates and better quality. The benefits of related 
regional integration in East Africa has been aptly 
demonstrated by the One Network Area (ONA), which A series of gateways have been 
introduced in Burundi , which have 
proved unconducive to supporting 
telecoms and broadband market 
development.  
The introduction of a unique common 
gateway, administered by 
International Telecom Services (ITS), 
has created a de facto monopoly in 
the international voice and text traffic 
market segment. Since 2015, all 
operators are required to transit their 
international traffic through ITS. A flat 
tax of USD 0.16 is subsequently 
imposed on each minute of voice 
traffic. The process under which this 
license was awarded has not been 
publicly disclosed and, unlike all other 
operators, ITS is exempt from paying 
fees or taxes to the Government of 
Burundi. 
In 2019, government decided to 
introduce a second gateway for 
internet and data traffic. The decision 
became effective in May 2019. The 
new gateway will be run by BBS. 
Although pitched under the guise of 
security, this gateway has hiked up 
prices for operators, lowered the 
quality of internet available to service 
providers, and compromised recent 
private investments made in the 
sector. In addition, BBS recently 
entered the retail market, which 
reinforces its monopoly power (as 
further detailed in Box 1).
 
The use of gateways is generally 
viewed as running counter to global 
best practice . Typically, they can be 
counter-productive, and are known to 
create practices of undercutting, 
bypassing, or refiling, which ultimately 
impact fiscal revenue and ability to 
regulate the sector. Burundi is yet to joint (see Box 5). The wider benefits of an  East Africa Single Digital Market (SDM) is 
discussed at the end of the report.  
 
 
 
The low demand for connectivity is now one of the main constraints to the digital economy in Burundi. 
As discussed in the previous sections, while internet is increasingly available through mobile networks, 
constraints that impact accessibility and affordability are still very present in the population, due to 
the lack of skills and digital culture, low perceived value of adopting new technology, and the low 
purchasing power that result in only 13.2 percent penetration of mobile broadband connections. This 
is further constrained by structural difficulties such as lack of electricity. Access to handsets remains 
low; for a majority of consumers, this is due to affordability constraints. 
 
The low purchasing power is one of the most constraining factors to broadband penetration, despite 
a relatively favorable cost of access at USD 3.17 per GB.  Operators have employed several tactics to 
ensure Burundians access to the internet at more affordable rates, but progress has been slow. 
Onatel, the national PTO, launched the ADSL2+ project in 2016, targeting small and medium 
enterprises (SME), public sector administration, schools, hospitals, libraries, the media and Burundian 
households to offer internet at reduced rates. Other operators have invested in flexible price bundling 
promotions (e.g. Econet’s 1.5GB for 55 US cents) in order to entice data consumers. Mobile operators 
provide flexible options to customers with prices starting at 11 US cents for a one-day pass of 40MB, 
rising to USD 3 and USD 38 for 30-day-validy data packs at 1 GB at 25 GB caps, respectively. 
 
In addition, there is little perceived value of the benefits of digital technologies.  As discussed in 
Chapter 4, awareness and skill training could help Burundians in lifting bottlenecks that prevent a 
more general utilization of digital technology. The lack of digital content offered to Burundians is also 
symptomatic of the difficulty to launch digital initiatives in the country. Section 5.2.5 on e-commerce 
platforms also points out that most initiatives disappear after a few years due to the lack of uptake 
from the general public. 
 
Parts of the Burundian economy are not yet ready for digital transformation, as some key foundational 
elements are insufficiently robust to support the change.  Most notably, this includes the existing In 2014, the countries of the East African Community (EAC) made a joint commitment to create 
the One Network Area (ONA ). The ONA currently covers Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda and South Sudan, 
with the possibility for Burundi and Tanzania to join the network. The agreement introduced 
harmonized rate caps for cross-border traffic originating and terminating within participating ONA 
countries, and eliminates roaming surcharges for users traveling within the region. The ONA 
applies to both voice and data traffic, with significant impact as cross-border traffic is growing 
rapidly in the region. Regionally, the effect of ONA has been marked: cross border traffic tripled 
between Uganda and Kenya in the wake of ONA’s introduction, this is an illustrative example of 
potential impact that an initiative like this could have on Burundi. 
 
For Burundi, joining the ONA would be a positive step forward in achieving both better rates and 
higher quality for internet users , and also in terms of updating internet sector regulation to regional 
best practices, and fostering cross-border data exchanges with EAC countries. Experience 
suggests that interventions that help lower connectivity prices for consumers stimulate uptake of 
digital technology, thus making it a high priority in the context of Burundi and the AU’s objective to 
reach universal access within 2025.

 infrastructure and electrical networks, as well as extreme poverty and urgent health needs that 
relegate the internet adoption and use to a secondary priority. 
 
There is a need and an urgency to deepen broadband penetration to low-income and rural potential 
customers. The USF will be a key instrument in achieving this goal, and  can support adoption through 
awareness raising, training and provision of local access points. Ignoring these necessary reforms 
means falling farther behind; investing in both the infrastructure and its essential complements is key 
to the success of the digital transformation. 
 
 Important progress made in rolling out the 
national fiber backbone network , especially 
first- and middle-mile infrastructure  
 Demand is growing in urban areas  
 Internet prices are low in absolute terms , but 
very high as a share of GNI per capita  
 New regulations in the telecom sector  lay 
the foundations for interconnection and 
interoperability, but more are needed, and 
implementation capacity is lacking  Demand is now the most important barrier to 
further technology adoption 
 Burundi is characterized by a small market  
with low purchasing power , low skills base  
and a low perceived value of ICT 
 Low penetration rates  of internet services and 
mobile devices 
 Low quality of connectivity and speed , with 
two-thirds of the connections being 2G  
 High competition risks , due to existing 
gateways, market concentration, taxation, 
high entry costs and inexistent USF facility 
 Good momentum in the market with recent 
private sector investments, new regulations 
and opportunities in the last and middle 
mile segments 
 Recent agreements to build additional fiber 
infrastructure with Rwanda and Tanzania 
 The USF could be expanded beyond its 
current use for rural connectivity and 
bringing marginalized groups online 
 Opportunity to leverage the cybersecurity 
industry and data privacy as a driver of 
economic growth   Achieving universal access , including in rural 
areas, will require a significant and 
coordinated effort  
 Risk of deepening the digital divide , as 87 
percent of the population live in rural area, 
and digital adoption is slow. 
 These factors make it difficult to reach a 
critical scale  in the telecom market  
 Burundi’s landlocked reality constitutes a 
reliance on its neighbors, notably Tanzania 
where TTCL has a stranglehold over transit. 
 
 
The following recommendations could support the development of digital infrastructure in Burundi:  
 
 
R1. Liberalize access to the gateway, curb the emerging monopoly of BBS and lift restrictions on 
internet service providers (ISPs) . While the second national operator, Lumitel, has its own international 
gateway, a new directive will now mandate payment to and dependence on BBS. And despite the large number of ISPs licensed, many face restrictions. Restrictions on entry into the fixed-line and 
international gateway markets have meant that ISPs must lease infrastructure from BBS and Lumitel. 
BBS, until recently, has had a stranglehold on landing stations, although two mobile operators and one 
ISP (CBINet) belong to the consortium that owns the BBS network. The licensing process around both 
the voice and data gateways needs to be more transparent.
 
R2. Focus on extending connectivity to key white spaces in the middle-mile segment . The USF, which 
should be used to ensure that internet access and use is a reality for all, remains, for the most part, 
an untapped resource. This issue is compounded by the fact that information — let alone up-to-date 
data — on the use and effectiveness of the USF is kept behind closed doors or is missing entirely. 
Funds are collected but not spent on connectivity projects, and when spent, not in a timely manner. 
Therefore, it is urgent to: 
 Increase transparency of USF financing and operations. Ensure that USF keeps track of data on 
fund contributions, disbursements, and project design and selection available to the public in 
an open data format, and that this data is disaggregated by gender and other factors (e.g., age, 
location, income), where possible. 
 Amplify the power of USF funds with programs that specifically target barriers to connectivity. 
These might include public access spaces designed for youth, public Wi-Fi spots or zones, 
subsidized devices for households, and digital skills training in schools.  
 Re-enact laws or other rules governing the USF which require all monies in the fund to be spent 
by the end of each fiscal year. This will help to promote timely disbursements 
 Roll out shared infrastructure in rural areas. The difficult geography of Burundi and lack of 
electricity and access roads are hindering the deployment of connectivity infrastructure in rural 
areas. Newer, lower-cost connectivity technology and business models, and more rigorous 
enforcement of license obligations can help.  
 Facilitate the entry of independent wholesale broadband operators 
 
R3. Facilitate deployment of infrastructure through ramp-up of high-capacity FTTP and build-out of 
associated infrastructure . The main challenge on the supply side is insufficient access points such as 
hotspots, despite high fiber density. Renewed effort is needed to: 
 Encourage open access to the Onatel’s network and require all major infrastructure programs 
(such as roads, railways, pipelines, and energy distribution) to include provision for a fiber link. 
 Fiberize towers and deploy more higher-capacity data centers (to make government services 
available in rural areas. There are only about four data centers of decent grade.  
 Interconnect the BTS’s of operators with fiber instead of the existing microwave connections, 
in order to secure high-fidelity bandwidth throughput between locations.  
 Facilitate the establishment of a local data center market  
 
 
 
R4. Increase service affordability by lowering prices, innovating in pricing and partnerships models. 
Burundi has the highest fiber density in its region, but utilization is low due to high prices, lack of digital 
skills and awareness as well as low purchasing power for devices and data.  Affordability of terminals 
is low, given low purchasing power. Among the under-served population, the largest segment consists 
of those who possess basic ICT skills but cannot afford access and devices. Efforts to boost demand 
among this segment include: 
 Strengthening the weak credit culture and credit infrastructure 
 Developing flexible payment terms for data wholesalers and adapting the VAT system that 
imposes a tax obligation when an invoice (whether proforma or not) is issued. 
 Providing special data bundles for use on ecommerce sites.  
 R5. Increase purchasing power of the bottom of the population, which hold the greatest for increasing 
penetration.  The next one million subscribers will predominantly come from the bottom of the 
consumer ladder. There are already extensive connectivity networks, at least for major neighborhoods, 
and thus the next area of action is to boost people’s purchasing power or reduce costs of access.  
 
R6. Increase awareness and availability of digital solutions . The digital economy is still a novel idea in 
Burundi. Consumer attitudes and poor perceived value of digital goods (including quality and merchant 
fulfilment) are key obstacles to the growth of digital businesses. At present, consumers manage this 
problem by contacting the seller to inspect the product, a practice that reduces the practice of e-
commerce. It is essential to expand awareness around the connectivity infrastructure already in place 
and how to unlock its potential in Burundi. Digital adoption requires knowledge and familiarity of digital 
technology how to access to it, and how to best apply it.  
 
R7. Increase demand clusters and supporting content and services. Authorities should incentivize 
more complex use cases for the use of connectivity such as e-commerce platforms and creative 
content such as cultural entertainment and social media. In doing so, it would be useful to re-imagine 
and integrate systems for logistics, payments and identification. Additional areas include: 
 Encourage digital finance, including the penetration of new use cases beyond mobile money.  
 Accelerate digital skills and entrepreneurship initiatives and improving their design.  
 Sensitize students and entrepreneurs on IT opportunities. 
 
 
R8. Update the legal framework . A new legal framework is required to tackle emerging issues on 
infrastructure sharing, PPPs, e-commerce, data protection and cybersecurity. This will help to promote 
competition through a truly transparent and open access framework. An open access framework will 
fill the gaps in fiber optic and last-mile broadband infrastructure disrupted by BBS’ vertical model. 
 
R9. Review multiple taxation issues by setting up an Industry Working Group . A working group with the 
oversight of the regulator ARCT or the inter-ministerial agency SETIC, should review multiple taxation 
cases (such as the situation with the international gateway), and enlist the support of all stakeholders, 
articulate and publicize the telecom industry’s position on the negative impact of multiple taxation. It 
This will help develop strategies for addressing and managing the threat posed by multiple taxation to 
the growth of the ICT industry. A new framework will provide nationwide broadband on an open-access, 
non-discriminatory basis, thereby lowering costs and facilitating affordable access to users.  
 
R10. Ensure capacity building for the industry regulator ARCT. Given the critical role of the regulator 
and its currently weak capacity, it is recommended to: 
 Establish technical assistance to update and complete the legal and regulatory framework for 
electronic communications, to enhance open market terms and ensure fair, non-discriminatory 
access to transmission networks on an open-access basis.  
 Provide ARCT equipment for effective spectrum and terminal control. ARCT does not have the 
technical capability to oversee and manage the volume of data and other intelligence. 
Previously, ARCT provided the World Bank with a quotation for the equipment, however the 
engagement process was shut down due to the monopoly of BBS.  
 Increase the regulator's enforcement capacities and autonomy in launching a market study for 
the definition of the relevant markets and measurement of market dominance. 
 
R11. Strengthen inter-ministerial coordination with the Executive Secretariat for Telecommunications, 
Information and Communications.  SETIC was established as an autonomous government agency with 
the authority to provide ICT services to the government and support to the national backbone project 
and other digital initiatives of Burundi. However, SETIC needs to be reinforced to serve as a 
comprehensive end-to-end project focal point for ICT projects in the years to come. Its authority will need to include the ability to lead planning, procurement, and resource and stakeholder coordination 
for ICT projects. The success of SETIC will depend largely on the support from the highest levels of 
government to undertake its work. SETIC should have enough capacity for policymakers to trust the 
agency's judgment and heed its recommendations and allow it to play a strong role in the capital 
restructuring or privatization of BBS, and the restructuring of the incumbent Onatel. 
  
 
 
 
Digital skills represent one of the most transversal building-blocks of the digital economy.  For Burundi, 
the development of a digitally savvy workforce is essential to support the emergence of new sectors, 
services, as well as access to new and more advanced jobs. The entire range of basic to more 
specialized digital skills can support job creation, by preparing the workforce for stronger technological 
development. Technology adoption has been shown to have a more positive impact on job creation for 
unskilled and lower-educated workers in low income countries than in most higher income countries.28 
In this context, equipping citizens with digital skills is part of the digital transformation process and 
could be a significant step in enabling innovation and ensuring that the country does not lag behind 
its regional peers in terms of supporting accelerated digital development. However, as noted in the 
preceding chapter, weak digital literacy is also one of the key bottlenecks to wider access to digitally 
enabled services in Burundi and creating a large enough digital consumer base to fuel new digital 
service development.

Burundi has established several digital skills targets, as part of the National ICT Development Policy . 
These include training 50 percent of civil servants in basic ICT skills and having at least 1,500 
advanced ICT professionals in the country by 2025. The Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific 
Research recently validated a new strategy that established related targets, which is due to be rolled 
out in 2020. Moreover, the Ministry of Youth, Posts and ICT , (MoYPICT) has sought to increase access 
to ICT-related opportunities for young Burundians, through a series of smaller pilot initiatives and 
workshops that support digital skills.29  
 
The education sector recently began grappling with the digital skills agenda, however, limited progress 
has been made to date. The Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education  has begun to integrate digital 
skills in the curriculum, from basic through to secondary level. Integrating ICT in education is seen as 
means of enabling enhanced education delivery and training. A recent report prepared by the Ministry 
of Higher Education also looks at how to provide increasing support for advance and high-end digital 
skills linked to big data and AI.30 However, as it stands, no overarching and dedicated digital skills 
strategy exists, nor is there a holistic framework for classifying digital skills competencies.  
 
 
This chapter applies the DigComp 2.1 Digital Skills Framework31 to analyze the state of digital skills in 
Burundi. According to this framework, digital skills can be broken down into four general proficiency 
levels:  
 
 are typically taught at primary and lower secondary school level , 
and involve the foundational digital literacy needed to use basic digital devices, tools and 
applications.  
 
 : should be provided to students in upper secondary school , 
technology programs at TVET institutions, and undergraduate students in courses that apply 
technology. Intermediate level proficiency would typically be required in middle-level 
occupations. However, moving forward, intermediate digital skills are expected to be a 
ubiquitous requirement for all formal employment.  
 
 are primarily developed through core engineering programs , especially 
electrical and computer engineering and science programs. Advanced level proficiency is 
typically required of occupations with a high level of ICT intensity, involving the application of 
digital technologies, including IT engineers and, increasingly, finance professionals.  
 
 Are typically provided at the postgraduate (masters and 
doctorate) level , focusing on advanced computer science and engineering, as well as applied 
mathematics and related fields. Highly specialized digital skills are considered a requirement 
for scientific and advanced ICT professional occupations, which involved the development of 
new digital technologies, products and services. 
 
More detailed definitions can be found in Annex 3.  
 
29 The Ministry reference efforts to support digital skills. However, the exact nature is unclear and scale appeared 
small.

proficiency levels and examples of use.   
 
 
 
Data is scant on the present level of digital skills coverage in Burundi.  No data/indicators on digital 
skills are being systematically collected or tracked by the education sector or the ICT sector, despite 
related targets being set. Nor is the Burundian National Office for Employment and the Labor Force, 
created in 2016 under the Ministry of Labor, tracking the supply and demand of digital skills in the 
labor market as part of regular labor market surveys. In the absence of any official digital skills 
database at government-level, Burundi’s only techhub (BujaHub) has created its own registry of digital 
talent, recording available programmers that operate locally and the languages they master. Allegedly, 
this database captures the information of some 23,000 programmers, which would be an impressive 
figure for such a small country.  
 
Nevertheless, current levels of foundational digital skills attainment among adults are estimated to be 
moderate, based on what can be inferred from key education and literacy indicators. Currently, the 
adult literacy rate in Burundi stands at 68 percent, suggesting the likelihood of at least a corresponding 
32 percent foundational digital skills gap, as literacy is typically considered a pre-requisite for 
foundational digital skills.32  
 
Educational attainment is low, which suggested low overall foundational digital skills acquisition 
particularly as digital skills are yet to be fully embedded in Burundi’s basic education system (as will 
be seen below). While enrollment in primary education is high (see Box 6), the completion rate is only 
63 percent and drops to 32.4 percent for lower secondary.33 Both have been falling since 2013 and 
2016, respectively. Educational attainment (of at least upper secondary school) is low among adult 
over the aged of 25 – a mere 3.3 percent – one of the lowest figures globally.34 This is likely to have 
created a limited pipeline of students capable of accessing intermediate to highly advance digital skills

training, even when disregarding issue related to the availability and 
quality of related programs locally (which is explored further below). 
Moreover, given the current make-up of the Burundi workforce, where 
over 90 percent are employed in the agriculture sector, the level of 
intermediate to highly specialized digital skills is also expected to be 
low, as there are few occupations with a high level of ICT intensity 
outside the telecommunication sector.  
 
The basic education system has critical role to play in building the 
foundational digital skills base in Burundi.  By embedding foundational 
digital skills in early grade and basic education ( Le Fondamental ), 
where enrollment is high, Burundi stands the best chance of ensuring 
universal foundational digital skills coverage. Notably, students in 
Burundi that complete primary education have traditionally recorded 
better reading and mathematics results than most other West and 
Central African countries. As noted in Box 7, support for foundational 
basic skills will also need to be complemented by a foundational soft 
skillset. 
  
Currently, foundational digital skills are formally part of the national 
curriculum at lower secondary education level.  Digital skills training is 
mandated from Grade 7, following 2012 reforms that that sought to 
prioritize strategic skillsets. However, as it stands, no digital skills 
initiatives cover primary schools.  
 
Nonetheless, due to a lack of qualified teachers, weak access to 
electricity, connectivity and ICT equipment, very few schools deliver 
related training in practice. In 2018, UNESCO estimated that a mere 
0.7 percent of secondary schools had internet access, and only 8.4 
percent of primary schools had access to electricity. According to the 
Department of Education Statistics, in 2019, the average number of 
computers per school (both primary and secondary) was a mere 0.43.  
At secondary level (i.e. post-fondamental ), ICT is allegedly taught as a 
subject matter. This course aims to support only foundational digital 
skills, as intermediary skills are not included.  Again, while mandated 
on paper, only a handful of schools appear to be delivering this 
course, for similar reasons noted above. Course enrollment does not 
appear to be tracked, nor are related education outcomes assessed 
at the end of secondary education. Moreover, in the absence of 
adequate connectivity, electricity and ICT equipment etc., where 
offered, digital skills are taught in theory rather than through practical 
application, limiting their impact and value.  
 
However, a more concerted effort to deliver foundational digital skills 
training appears to be made at Burundi’s high schools of excellence.  
There are currently five high schools of excellence, established across five regions. In academic year 
2019-2020, these schools enrolled a total number of 1,287 students (839 boys and 448 girls), 
selected on merit and entrance exam scores. These schools appear to have some IT equipment, albeit 
unevenly distributed. While highly qualified teachers are recruited and a rigorous selection process is 
following by these schools, weak access to qualified teachers in digital subjects hampers effective

According to education authorities, foundational digital skills training has been integrated in all 286 
public and private technical schools36 in Burundi – currently, some 61,005 students are enrolled. In 
terms of more intermediate-level courses offered, typical modules include general ICT management, 
including database management, accounting software, and computer maintenance.  
Burundi has committed to ensuring universal foundational skills coverage at higher education 
institutions (HEI). However, digital skills training in HEIs suffers from similar challenges to primary and 
secondary schools, including weak access to computer terminals and digital equipment, low 
connectivity and a lack of other basic digital and analogue prerequisites. Burundi Education and

36 108 are public and 178 are private Beyond digital skills, it is worth highlighting the need for complementary soft skills. The twenty-first 
century labor market is placing an increasing emphasis on key soft skills such as effective problem 
solving etc. Employees need to be team players, critical thinkers, and effective communicators. 
Burundi’s formal education system will thus need to recognize and make necessary efforts to 
include these soft skills in its education delivery, at all levels of education.  
 
According to PASEC 2015, Burundi’s performance is significantly superior to other countries in 
reading (Kirundi) and mathematics in Grade 2, and in mathematics and reading (French) in Grade 
6. In Grade 2, 79 percent and 97 percent of students achieved “sufficient competency” in reading 
and mathematics, respectively, outperforming all other countries in SSA. (Figure 4.2). While this is 
a good starting point, strong foundational literacy and numeracy skills, will need to be 
complemented with strong socio-emotional skills.  
 
Improving Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) teaching in basic and 
secondary education will be essential to creating a pipeline of students who can access higher 
education programs in related fields.

Not competent Low competency High competencyResearch Network (BERNET) has sought to 
provide many HEIs with affordable 
broadband, yet at present, only 15 HEIs are 
connected (see Box 8). 
 
Meanwhile, many HEIs, including public 
universities, have already started to include 
ICT as either a crosscutting course or as a 
dedicated department. There are 38 HEIs in 
Burundi, which are most likely to offer 
advanced digital skills training locally. 
Examples include the Université du lac 
Tanganyika, where the ICT faculty offers a 
technical diploma in network maintenance.37 
The University of Burundi’s engineering 
faculty also offers a general course in IT.38 
Overall, most students at this level are 
enrolled in computer science, software 
management and network maintenance 
courses, but very few in programming and 
software engineering courses. During the 
2017/2018 academic year, some 3,431 
students were reportedly enrolled in related 
courses, yet only 25 percent of them were 
female, according to the Ministry of Higher 
Education.  
 
An interdisciplinary commission exists at the 
higher education level that redefines the 
curricula every four years and determines the 
types of certification offered . Courses offered 
within HEIs are harmonized and aligned with 
the East African Community (EAC) interuniversity council, which offers one of the most promising 
platforms to support regional collaboration on digital skills (Box 8).  
 
Universities do not systematically track where students end up and whether they manage to access 
employment, following graduation. This would help determine quality and relevance of existing 
programs available. There are, for example, no tracer surveys conducted to date. However, according 
to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Higher Education, anecdotal evidence suggests that ICT 
laureates generally perform well and are able to gain employment or establish their own business. 
 
Some private universities have been known to use distance learning solutions at a very basic level, 
while other universities are currently exploring potential distance learning programs.39 However, 
COVID-19 has illustrated that local capacity to distance learning remains limited. Weak access to 
digital devices and connectivity among both students and teachers is likely to hamper further scale-
up. As notes in Chapter 3, according to 2017 ITU figures, a mere 0.3 percent of households had wired 
internet, and only 1 percent had a computer at home.  
 
37 See: https://ult.bi/fr/institut-de-maintenance-et-reseaux 
38 See: http://www.ub.edu.bi/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MAQ-FSI.pdf 
39 According to stakeholder consultations, Mount Kenya University, Bujumbura International University and 
International University of Equator currently have implemented distance learning solutions. The University of 
Burundi, University Lumière of Bujumbura and the University of Great Lakes are currently exploring these tools.   
In 2017, a partnership for a Common Higher 
Education Area was agreed within the Inter-
University Council for East Africa (IUCEA), 
including Burundi and Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda 
and Tanzania. The harmonized system fosters 
mobility of students and academics by aligning 
course curricula and allowing for credit exchange 
between universities in the region, while helping 
to boost quality assurance in the education 
sector at the EAC level. 
 
 
BERNET has been working to extend access to 
affordable bandwidth capacity among HEI. The 
national network currently consists currently of 
some 15 interconnected members. Moreover, 
BURNET was recently integrated in the regional 
data communications network for National 
Research and Education Networks (NREN) in 
Eastern and Southern Africa –UbuntuNet. This 
development was supported by the European 
Commission. With a 500 Mbps link from Kigali, 
Burundi’s NREN is now connected to 11 other 
countries who are members of the UbuntuNet 
alliance.  
  
Private providers also contribute to digital skills training delivery in Burundi – often complementing 
and/or filling the gaps left by the formal education system. Many of these trainings are offered on a 
commercial basis, on-demand, to interested firms looking to upskill or offer in-service capacity building 
programs for their staff, but also to individuals. For example, anecdotal evidence suggests that staff 
are sometimes sent on rapid digital skills training to, for example, learn the basic Microsoft Office 
package. Typically, these programs are offered by a recognized institute and lead to a certification. 
However, in the absence of a unified and integrated policy governing digital skills training, there is no 
quality control of related programs, yet stakeholder consultations suggest that they are valued. 
Notably, some companies in the telecoms sector train recent graduates in-house, as many lack 
adequate and applied work experience. There appears to be room to build on and formalize related 
schemes by increasing industry-academia exchange to enhance access to on-the-job training and 
internship programs for recent graduates that can help smooth the study-to-work transition.  
 
Burundi’s only techhub, BujaHub, is also running a series of digital skills initiatives. These include the 
‘Digital Generation’ program, which targets secondary school students, with the aim of teaching them 
how to use social media and create an online profile. The ‘Digital Ladies’ platform aims to provide local 
female entrepreneurs with intermediate digital skills that allow them to establish an online presence 
and use online marketing tools. So far, this scheme has provided training to some 100 women, with 
plans to cover a further 2,000. BujaHub also runs ‘WebDev’, a four-month long website development 
training program, launched in partnership with the Integrated Polytechnics University. Sor far, 30 web-
developers have been trained. Finally, BujaHub is also an implementing partner of the ‘Digital Skills 4 
Africa’ initiative, run by Google, which is targeting 18,000 university students and members of youth, 
church and community groups, across four Central and Eastern African countries, with foundational 
digital skills training to improve access to jobs online.  
 
Development partners have also piloted a handful of digital skills schemes, but few at scale, and 
neglecting key groups such as out-of-school youth. For example, the Alliance Française is providing 
some training in website development, using Java Script. In the past, UNESCO has hosted inter-school 
hackathon, targeting girls who can code.40 NGOs, such as Libraries without Borders, have also sought 
to pilot access to mobile learning and reading content in returnee communities, in partnership with 
UNDP.41 Additionally, UNWOMEN have supported digital literacy schemes for women in Burundi. Better 
donor coordination on this agenda could support scale up, given the strong interest displayed by both 
the public and private sector in addressing the digital skills gap.42 For example, there is an opportunity 
to anchor related initiatives in the community ICT centers that will be financed under the Universal 
Service Fund (USF), discussed in Chapter 3. As it stands, digital skills programs that cater to out-of-
school youth and adults working in the informal sector appear to be wholly insufficient. 
 
While there is no official data available, stakeholder consultations suggest that employer demand for 
basic digital skills is high. The absence of platforms for online job posting also makes it tricky to gain 
a true sense of current demand. However, more and more small and medium enterprises (SME), as 
well as large corporations – particularly in the telecom sector – indicate that there is a much higher 
demand for skilled ICT professionals than available supply. Further dialogue between industry-
academia could help create a more complete picture of current demand (disaggregated by digital skills 
level), and in turn support the development of a demand-driven curriculum in the TVET and higher 
education sub-sectors.  
 
As it stands, available HEI education programs in ICT appear to be oversubscribed , pointing to both an 
inadequate local supply of training, but also high demand among students who see the value and 
potential employment opportunities attached to this skillset. For example, the University of Burundi 
 
40 UNESCO (2018). YouthMobile: Empowering the next generation . 
41 See: https://www.librarieswithoutborders.org/countries/burundi/ 
42 UNESCO (2018). Synthèse de l’état des lieux de la recherche-développement au Burundi.  can only accommodate 30 students per year in digital skills-related programs yet receives over 500 
enrollment request each year.  
 
 
While the Government has displayed a strong commitment to equipping its citizens with digital skills, 
a unified and integrated framework for digital skills is still missing. This will be critical in guiding the 
development of future policies, standards, programs and curricula that ensure that strategies adopted 
in this area are operationalized, which has unfortunately not been the case in the past. This will also 
be key in conducting more comprehensive digital skills assessments, which help bridge present digital 
skills data gaps, map and align existing and future digital supply and demand (discussed in Section 
4.2.4.4). The new National Commission, in charge of Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) can 
potentially act as a focal point in the STI community. 
  
Despite the integration of ICT in the existing curriculum, there is no dedicated curriculum for digital 
skills. This is needed to help guide teachers and ensure uniform quality in teaching and training 
delivery. Moreover, the regulatory gap in cybersecurity and ICT ethics are likely to limit integration of 
related components in the curriculum. General cyber awareness, allowing users to safely navigate the 
web and avoid scams etc., should be an integral element of building foundational digital skills at all 
levels in Burundi, and thus needs to be integrated in the curriculum.  
 
Moreover, there is currently no coordinated effort and overarching vision for the digital agenda at the 
national level. There is, for example, scope for great collaboration between the education and ICT 
sectors. Neighboring countries, such as Kenya, have created inter-ministerial committees to support 
successful integration of digital skills in the education systems, ensuring that all key enablers are 
considered.43 These structures typically include the Ministry of Education (leadership/strategy/policy), 
Ministry of Energy (school access to electricity), Ministry of ICT (school access to internet and 
technology), as well as authorities in charge of teacher training, curriculum and content development.  
Currently, no working groups capable of developing the digital skills agenda and program expansion 
nationwide exist. Funding is insufficient, meaning that related working groups that crowd in 
development partners could also offer potential.  
 
Current gaps in access to electricity and connectivity services in the education sector, 
identified above, are likely to be a binding constraint on the ability to deliver digital skills training. Many 
schools have no electricity; a 2016 benchmarking illustrates that Burundi has some of the lowest 
figures on the continent (see Figure 4.3). Even fewer schools have reliable internet access.  
 
 
 
43  
The education sector also lacks the requisite ICT equipment. 
Access to computers and other necessary basic IT equipment is extremely limited.  When addressing 
the issue of insufficient access to equipment, it will also be critical to consider the technical support 
required to enable regular maintenance. Experience suggest that this aspect is often neglected, 
leaving equipment in disrepair. Nascent efforts have been made to expand access to computers and 
basic software at secondary school level, piloted by the MoYPICT (see Box 9). Without the requisite 
equipment and infrastructure digital skills will continue to be taught merely in theory.  
 
The absence of suitable teaching material and digital content is likely to be 
another challenge. Teachers will need to be equipped with not only better curriculum, but also with 
adequate tools and knowledge to effectively deliver it.  
 
A lack of qualified teachers to teach digital skills, and/or confident to leverage 
digital tools as part of their teaching is another challenge. The need for qualified teachers with the 
requisite content knowledge and the pedagogical expertise to teach core ICT skills, integrate ICT in 
their teaching practice, and provide basic technical support is reportedly higher than the available 
number of teachers. Creating a digital learning environment requires teachers to possess the digital 
skills to deliver training, and the motivation to do so.  
 
Addressing gaps in digital skills development will require closer partnerships with the private sector.  
Targeted management skills training would increase adequate labor supply, boost labor productivity 
and reduce poverty. In Burundi, the private sector is not involved in preparing education sector policies, 
strategies, curricula and programs. This prevents the development of a demand-driven curriculum 
sensitive to labor market needs, and also limits scope for industry placements, that could facilitate the 
school-to-work transition. At the higher education level, there is a lack of university-industry learning 
platforms providing real-world digital skills learning experiences for university students. In addition, 
rapid-skills training programs on digital skills, such as coding bootcamps or other similar learning 
models run by private providers are at a nascent stage. Private digital skills providers such as Andela, 
active in neighboring Rwanda and Kenya, are largely absent in the Burundi. 
 
The private digital service providers could be playing a bigger role in educating consumers to expand 
the foundational digital skills base . In many neighboring countries, MNOs play an active role in 
supporting public foundational digital skills initiatives, which enable them to expand their consumer 
base and profit margin (e.g. by increase subscribers’ data usage). While related initiatives should make 
commercial sense, MNOs in Burundi claim that their profit margins are too slim to be reinvesting in 
related initiatives. 
 
Weak labor market data is hampering effective policy development, planning and decision-making. A 
lack of data on the current and future supply and demand of digital skills for each competency level is 
a key constraint to developing a better policy response. Reliable and timely data on labor-market 
demand would help policymakers evaluate and decide on how to develop Burundi’s digital skills base. ICT clubs have been set up in twelve secondary schools . Although the coverage is small and 
challenges such as access to electricity are prevalent, ICT clubs provide students with the 
opportunity to become familiar with computers, basic software such as Microsoft Word and Excel, 
as well as learn to navigate the web. ICT clubs were first launched in 2016 and focus particularly 
on improving access to digital solutions in rural schools.  More precise information on the number of existing and projected vacancies requiring digital skillsets 
would assist efforts to further assess and ensure that the supply of digital skills is adequate.  
 
Better data on digital skills teaching outcomes is needed. A high frequency survey is currently being 
piloted at primary level to collect better data on skills delivery.44 A similar approach to tracking digital 
skills delivery could be considered for secondary, TVET and HEI. Data collected will be collated in an 
integrated Education Information Management System, which is being upgraded (more on this in the 
next chapter, which reviews use of digital platforms in government).  
 
Teaching foundational digital skills in Burundi remains a challenge, in the absence of key enablers. 
While new strategies have been adopted, significant investments are needed to introduce the required 
infrastructure, hardware/software, as well as boost teacher training. Further work on curriculum and 
content development is also necessary to effectively embed digital skills in the formal education 
system. Demand for digital skills appears to outstrip supply, but in the absence of better data, crafting 
targeted policy responses will be difficult. There appears to be room to improve the quality and 
availability of existing advanced-level training available, creating entry points for crowding in the 
private sector in more effective ways e.g. to roll out rapid skilling initiatives and bootcamps.

The following recommendations could support the development of digital skills in Burundi:  
 
 
R1. Establish an integrated and well-coordinated national framework for digital skills that can inform 
curriculum development, needs assessments and teacher training. The framework should clearly 
define each of the digital skills and competency levels, as well as detail existing and projected labor-
market demand. It should also propose a consolidated response recognizing the current digital skills 
gap, as well as supporting movement towards a more coordinated approach.  
 
R2. Refine the digital skills curriculum The existing curricula could be expanded to include areas such 
as digital literacy, digital entrepreneurship and an introduction to digital media. Complementary soft 
skills such as creative thinking, problem solving and teamwork also need to be included in the 
curriculum. Foundational digital skills could be initially introduced as a “subject” for high school 
students, before being formally embedded across the basic education and secondary school 
curriculum, with clear digital content teaching and quality assessment methods. 
 
R3. Create an inter-ministerial forum to ensure that critical enablers are in place. Better inter-
ministerial coordination will be essential in ensuring that all the requisite enablers are in place to 
create a conducive environment for digital skills uptake.  
 
R4. Increase dialogue with the private sector.  The formal education system and the private sector 
should effectively partner to enhance the quality of digital skills training, particularly at TVET and higher 
education levels. Industry-academia exchange needs to be expanded to improve delivery of a more 
demand-driven education program and expand opportunities for practical training. 
 
R5. Equip schools and HEI with the requisite infrastructure and IT equipment. Additionally, teachers 
will require technical support for teachers to troubleshoot when faced with hardware, software, and 
internet connection issues.  
 
R6. Equip teachers with the requisite skills to delivery digital skills training . Equipping teachers with 
strategies to develop digital skills is also a vital prerequisite. Regular teacher training in ICT-related 
fields (not just the ICT educators) needs to be enhanced to develop sufficient competencies to ensure 
their students become digitally savvy.  
 
R7. Improve quality of STEM education . Pursuing advanced level digital skills require a solid foundation 
in STEM. Government should take deliberate actions to also improve girls’ participation in STEM to 
support greater gender parity for advanced-level digital skills.  
 
R8. Improve completion and transition rates to secondary education.  Adopting standards for 
secondary school completion will be particularly important, as current drop-out rates mean that many 
students forgo the opportunity to acquire STEM and digital skills via the basic education system.  
 
 
R9. Collect and maintain up-to-date information on digital skills and labor markets. Reliable and timely 
data that provides an accurate picture of present and future labor-market demand for digital skills, and the related supply (both in terms of quantity and quality), can help policymakers evaluate and 
decide on how to develop Burundi’s digital skills base. Given that digital skills are cross-cutting, the 
required inputs for this data collection exercise are likely come from a wide range of stakeholders.  
 
R10. Asses the quality of existing digital skill programs.  Further work is necessary to review the quality 
of existing programs and track related education outcomes. 
 
 
R11. Engage all relevant national and international stakeholders in digital skills agenda. Effectively 
engaging stakeholders would help to create strong buy-in for the digital skills framework and related 
strategies, as well as ensure adequate funding by donors. Non-profits and donors are likely to play a 
key role in ensuring that digital skills initiatives cover marginalized and neglected groups.  
 
R12. Crowd-in more private sector education providers. There is scope to expand access to bootcamps 
and tap into the rapid up-skilling models developed by private sector digital skill providers like Andela.  
 
 
 Burundi has a low-ranking on the Gender Inequality Index – it placed 124th out of 162 countries in 
the 2018 ranking, with varying progress over different indicators.45 Maternal mortality is high: for every 
100,000 live births, 712 women die from pregnancy related causes.46 Encouragingly, gender 
representation at government level is comparatively strong: at present: 38.8 percent of seats in 
Burundi’s parliament are held by women.47  
 
While primary data around the digital gender divide is not available, estimates suggest that women’s 
use of the internet is much lower than men’s in Burundi – the Digital Gender Gap calculates a gender 
gap of around 30 percent in internet use,48 and just over 20 percent in mobile use.49 According to 
Facebook Audience Insights, only 32 percent of Burundi’s Facebook users are women, and primarily 
younger women – some 81 percent of all female users in Burundi are 34 years or younger. Meanwhile, 
67 percent of all Facebook usage is centered in Bujumbura, suggesting that women in rural areas are 
at a disadvantage. Although Burundi has a Universal Service Fund (USF), discussed in Box 3, this 
mechanism is not currently be leveraged to serve digitally excluded groups, such as women, with 
targeted initiatives (albeit work is being done to support rural connectivity).50 Income barriers are likely 
to be a larger barrier for women, making both mobile devices and internet services unaffordable. 
 
While there is no data available around women’s digital literacy, the digital gender gap coupled with 
education data suggests that digital literacy is an access barrier for women.  There is a consistent 
gender disparity across key education metrics – 61 percent of women are literate, compared with 76 
percent of men; women receive a mean of 2.7 years of schooling compared to 3.6 years for men; a 
mere 7.5 percent of women have reached at least a secondary level of education compared to almost 
10 percent of men.  
 
As will be discussed further in Chapter 6, financial and economic inclusion remains very low in Burundi 
– and even lower for women. In 2014, only 6.7 percent of women aged 15 and above recorded owning 
an account.51 Stakeholder consultations suggested that women agriculturalists would stand to benefit 
from increasing mobile money adoption: in Burundi, women typically grow the produce. However, 
because commercial activities are largely undertaken by men, women have little control of household 
income. Women’s participation in the labor market, at 80.4 percent, is higher than men at 77.6 
percent. Mobile money accounts would thus allow women them to sell goods and save money 
discreetly. 
 
There is no data around women’s formal identity; overall better gender data is needed to inform key 
interventions.  A gender assessment should be carried out to identify and address gaps, in greater 
detail. Any study conducted should include data on digital and financial behaviors, as well as identity.

have been through the training. However, there are plans to scale this to 2,000.

Digital platforms play a critical role in connecting people, businesses and the Government – facilitating 
transactions and the exchange of information, goods and services in more efficient and convenient 
ways. In Burundi, digital platforms are likely to play an instrumental role in connecting rural 
communities with urban hubs, for example providing new and cost-effective ways of expanding service 
delivery to remote parts of the country, as well as by connecting rural farmers to global value chains 
and markets. However, the proliferation of digital platforms also risks exacerbating the existing urban-
rural digital divide, if disadvantaged groups are not provided with the means to connect and fully 
benefit. Moreover, without the right oversight and regulation, digital platforms raise new risks e.g. in 
relation to data protection and privacy, as well as market concentration that are explored further 
below.53  
 
This chapter analyzes the state of two categories of digital platforms relevant to Burundi’s digital 
development: public digital platforms and private digital platforms. 
 
 Public digital platforms  can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of core government 
functions and services, reduce unnecessary duplication of systems, combat fraud and 
corruption by increasing the security and traceability of transactions, and improve civic 
engagement and accountability, as well as support better service delivery. When designed with 
a whole-of-government and user-centric approach, digital platforms can thus significantly 
improve operational and economic efficiency of government operations and public service 
delivery in Burundi.

 Private digital platforms  can lower transaction costs and support innovative products and 
services, as well as  facilitate interactions between producers and consumers. Digital platforms 
support the creation of a digital marketplace that can help foster greater competition and 
improve market intermediation. By aggregating supply and demand, digital platforms help 
create new and inclusive markets as well as opportunities for new Burundian companies to 
reach new customers domestically, across the region, and beyond by contributing to global 
growth in e-commerce. Moreover, digital platforms can offer innovative solutions and products 
that help bridge gaps in traditional service access or delivery, and thus address fissures in the 
market. In Burundi, where unemployment is prevalent and informal activities constitute a 
significant proportion of the economy, digital platforms can help create growing opportunities 
for employment in the emerging “gig-economy”, via platforms that offer on-demand services. 
In neighboring Rwanda and Kenya, digital platforms thus employ some 24,000 and 286,000 
people, respectively.54  
 
The need to development both public and 
private platforms in Burundi is highlighted 
by the PNDTIC . The fourth strategic pillar 
under this policy aims to promote “e-
Government, e-Governance and Burundi 
online”; twelve priority actions are 
articulated under this section (see Box 
10).55 However, in the absence of funding 
and a clear roadmap for implementation, 
many of these priorities are yet to be 
actioned. This explicates the reasons why 
Burundi continues to rank poorly in 
relation to key digital platforms indicators, 
as seen in Table 5.1.

Burundi ranked 166th of 193 countries in the 2018 UN e-Government Development Index (EGDI), in 
2018, reflecting modest progress made in developing nascent e-government capabilities . It also 
ranked low in both the Digital Adoption Index, Government sub-index (121/180) and E-participation 
Index (147/193). As it stands, few back-end systems, process or databases have been fully digitized, 
and many administrative processes and services remain paper-based. While Government has 
developed an online presence, it is for the most part only able to offer simple one-way informational 
services. As will be seen below, the Government is yet to develop many of the building blocks needed 
to develop more sophisticated transactional services, which are seamlessly integrated, allowing it to 
reap the full benefits of digital platforms. Weak system integration of solutions deployed limit their 
impact. Overall, fragmentation and pockets of progress at a sector level characterize e-government 
initiatives piloted in Burundi so far.  
 
 
The e-government agenda in Burundi would benefit from clearer leadership and strategic direction. 
Burundi currently lacks an overarching e-government strategy/roadmap, enterprise architecture and 
interoperability blueprint, which can support movement toward a more integrated and strategic 
approach to e-government. As will be seen below, this has resulted in handful of disparate systems 
being rolled-out with limited provision for interoperability and joint standards. An overarching 
framework could also help crowd-in support from development partners in a more structured way. 
 
The e-government agenda is notionally led by the Ministry if ICT. As noted in Chapter 2, SETIC, the 
implementing arm, is charged with coordinating all large ICT projects within Government.  However, too 
often the Ministry and SETIC are both circumvented, which prevents enforcement of any shared 
technology standards, as well as drastically reducing cost-efficiency and opportunities for employing a 
whole-of-government approach to the e-government initiatives in Burundi. MDAs are inclined to 
implement projects independently, yet often lack the requisite technical expertise to do so. This has 
contributed to a proliferation of incompatible e-government systems, in terms of framework design, 
hardware, software and interfaces used, leveraging non-standardized data formats, etc. Shared 
elements and common processes are thus not identified during the design stage, making it more 
difficult to resolve downstream interoperability issues (which are discussed further below).  
 
Government digitalization initiatives in Burundi have mainly focused on the development of core back-
office systems . The GoB has deployed a handful back-office systems aimed at supporting central and 
core government functions, including public financial management (PFM) and human resources (HR) 
management. However, many key sectors are yet to fully digitize their back-office systems and very 
few are transversal. Only the health, education and land management sectors appear to have deployed 
management information systems (MISs). However, these systems are yet to be leveraged to serve 
citizens more directly through the expansion of front-facing e-health and e-education service delivery. 
Key systems developed so far include: 
 
 Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS): IFMIS was introduced by the 
Ministry of Economy, Finance and Development Cooperation in 2006, but took many years to 
become fully operationalized. For example, the accounting module was only completed in 
2019, after residual malfunctions had been resolved. Government is thus yet to produce fully 
automated public financial accounts through IFMIS. Budget monitoring and internal controls 
have improved but inefficiencies and delays persist. Moreover, in the absence of 
interconnectivity (discussed further below), data from the other ministries, departments and 
agencies (MDAs) still need to be manually inputted into the system, limiting its efficacy. 
Furthermore, IFMIS is not yet connected with the Burundi Revenue Authority (OBR) or the  
Burundi Central Bank, which would allow the system to capture public revenue and/or monitor 
payments made from the Treasury account. There are currently three IT engineers who ensure 
the maintenance of IFMIS, as well as undertaking data management and processing tasks. 
Unfortunately the government still relies heavily on the technical support provided by the 
foreign service provider that initially developed IFMIS, especially for medium to complex 
activities pertaining to the integration of new functionalities and the adaptation of the system 
to new PFM regulation. Finally, IFMIS users would benefit from further training in its 
functionalities to increase its adoption and application across government.  
 
 Integrated Human Resources Management System : The system was set up by the Tunisian 
company SIMAC and launched in 2011. The OPEN Paie et Ressources Humaines ( PRH) system 
offers an integrated and scalable solution for managing public sector payroll and the career 
management of civil servants. It is operated by the Centre de Traitement Informatique , placed 
under the authority of the General Director of the Public Service (in the Ministry of Civil Service) 
and is co-managed by the General Director of Budget at the Ministry of Finance. The career 
management, management processing and payroll modules of the platform have been 
delivered and are in use. An interface module that will allow for the transfer of salary data to 
the computerized system for budget management (SIGEFI), in order to control and validate 
payroll data, has been delivered but is not yet in use. It is estimated that close to 99 percent 
of Burundi’s civil servants are registered in OPEN PRH, save for public sector officials working 
for the Ministry of Defense, public security services56 and staff of autonomous agencies. 
Nevertheless, many other sectoral ministries and departments still continue to maintain their 
own HR management systems that have not been integrated with OPEN PRH.  
 
 Procurement: Burundi is yet to implement a fully-developed e-Procurement system but the 
Regulatory Authority for Public Contracts (ARMP) has an informational website, where 
provisional public procurement plans of various government institutions are periodically 
published.  
 
56 i.e. the system does not cover military service personnel and members of the police force  
 Customs: Like many other countries, Burundi has adopted SYDONIA World. 
 
 Electronic archiving of civil servants’ files:  funded by UNDP, an initiative was launched by the 
Ministry of Public Works, Labor and Social security to support the electronic archiving of all 
civil servant and state agent files in Burundi over a 5-year period. While a roadmap was 
developed, support for operationalization was suspended following the 2015 political crisis, 
and due to a lack of funds, the project has not proceeded since. 
 
 Land titling:  The Improvement of Management and Land Governance Project (PAGGF), 2014-
2018, implemented by the European Union (EU) and German Development Agency (GIZ) 
sought to modernize the Department of Land Titles. In total, some 48,154 paper-based land 
titles (around 40 percent of the titles listed since Independence) were indexed in an Excel 
database, and awaiting to be scanned. Some 19 percent of all titles were fully digitized as a 
result of the project.57 A land information system (SIF) was also developed to support the 
initiative, with four modules considered operational. However, SIF is yet to be fully deployed 
due to lingering interoperability issues between the different modules.  
 
 DHIS2 & Open Clinic: DHIS 2 is a flexible open-source web-based health information system, 
which also supports the use of geographic information systems (GIS), graphics and pivot 
crosstabs. DHIS 2 contains integrated data on HIV, infectious diseases, reproductive health, 
nutrition, and disease surveillance covering all health regions, health districts, and hospitals 
in Burundi.58 Open Clinic is an integrated hospital MIS that is used for the management of 
patients’ administrative and medical files, mapped to a unique patient identification number. 
All hospitals and health centers (publics and faith-based ones) use the DHIS2 system. Most 
have access to IT equipment and connectivity, though occasionally face connectivity issues. 
Health centers and hospitals enter data themselves directly in the DHIS2. Open Clinic 
technology is currently available in 23 Hospital (15 publics and 8 privately run hospitals). With 
the support of the Belgian Development Agency, ENABEL, and the EU, OpenClinic will be 
extended to a further 14 new hospitals by June 2022, leaving only ten unconnected.  
 
 Education Management Information System (EMIS): As noted in the preceding chapter, an 
EMIS does exists. However, consultation revealed that system is not operating as well as 
intended, and is somewhat outdated. The WB is thus planning to support the strengthening of 
EMIS, allowing for more reliable reporting by cleaning and updating the current EMIS database. 
New survey data collected will also be fed into the new database. Each school will be provided 
with a unique ID code, making it easier to track school-level performance, based on a protocol 
for numbering new schools. Moreover, school will be geo-tagged, enabling the use of GIS-based 
analytics.  
 
Digital Government-to-Business (G2B) and Government-to-Citizen (G2C) service delivery is weak. 
Making more public services digitally accessible to citizens through multiple channels lies at the heart 
of the Government’s vision to achieve “Digital Burundi” by 2025 – yet, front-facing e-service platforms 
remain few and far between.  Most public platforms geared towards businesses and citizens consist of 
informational websites.  
 
The GoB’s e-service delivery capability is restricted to providing “information-as-a-service” – i.e. 
publishing information online . Existing websites mainly support single one-directional interactions with 
 
57 GIZ, EU (2018). Rapport Final PAGGF, 1er Octobre 2014 – 30 Septembre 2018. 
58 MEASURE Evaluation (2019). Strengthening Health Information Systems in Burundi. users, as opposed to two-way communication where users can interact with government online, or 
more sophisticated transactional services that support end-to-end digital delivery of service.  
  
Government has developed an online presence through numerous government websites. This is 
typically the very first stage of e-service maturity, illustrating that Burundi lags behind many of its peers 
in East Africa, who score much higher in global e-government rankings. Currently, some  70 percent of 
ministries and central government agencies have websites and there is also a central government 
website.59. At present, only five line ministries lack websites, however, local government does not have 
adequate web presence - only two out of 18 provinces (Gitega and Bujumbura) have websites, and 
none of the communes.   
 
However, many of these websites only offer basic functionality, which limits their scope to facilitate 
digital interaction with users and more advanced e-services. SETIC, who is charged with managing 
government ICT services, suggested that more could be done to update these sites – many are written 
in outdated code, poorly maintained and lack central coordination/management.  On average, each 
site is managed by 1-2 technicians, tasked with maintaining hardware/software and updating the 
website. Only half of existing sites use the government or country domain names (gov.bi or .bi).  
 
Less than 20 percent of government websites analyzed have a clear target audience . While many of 
them contain a wealth of information, they offer very limited functions. For example, even basic 
functions are missing, such as downloadable forms/documents, tele-procedures, and messaging 
functions etc., which would typically be associated with an enhanced web-presence.  
 
A handful of platforms that aim to centralize information pertaining to key services have been 
developed:  
 
 Customs Guichet Unique Electronique (GUE):  Launched in 2015 and administered by the 
Burundi Revenue Authority (OBR), powered by the back-end system SYDONIA World, the 
system aims to reduce the number of administrative transactions required to clear customs, 
delivering faster customs clearances through a single electronic window.60  
 
 Investburundi.bi : Administered by the Investment Promotion Agency provide a one-stop-shop 
for those looking to start a business, by collating all relevant information in one place.  
 
 Isôko61: Another integrated platform for service delivery is Isôko, a web-based portal launched 
in 2018, by the Ministry of Civil Service, Labor and Employment ( Ministère de la Fonction 
Publique, du Travail et de l’Emploi ), with support from UNDP. Isôko aims to provide information 
to citizens on how to access more than 100 administrative services, covering a range of 
services from driving licenses to construction permits. This initiative has sought to pool 
information on the most commonly requested public services available to citizens in one 
central place. Isôko has been heralded as the most promising initiative expanding e-services 
to citizens, and yet it remains purely explanatory (i.e. detailing which MDA offers the service, 
how long it will take to process and how much it will cost etc.), and contains links to other 
government websites. Citizens thus still need to physically visit a government office to obtain 
the necessary documents/forms needed for processing, make needed payments and verify 
their identify, which limits the added value of the service. The platform could easily be 
enhanced by providing downloadable forms, at a minimum. Like many of the other platforms 
noted in this chapter, development of Isôko has been spearheaded by a sectoral line ministry, 
with little input from the line Ministry specializing in ICT and its implementing arm SETIC .

Back-end integration and use of shared data infrastructure also allows the decentralization of some 
key services, under the Guichet Unique Provincial (GUP) – however, physical processing is still 
required. The GUP is an inter-agency service that allow Burundian citizens to locally access five out of 
the 11 most requested documents (passport, a travel pass for the Great Lakes Economic Community 
region, driver's license etc.) in ten provinces, instead of traveling to Bujumbura. This allows for 
biometric documents to be delivered to physical counters in the provinces where citizens can access 
them. Similar to Isôko, GUP is part of the National Program to Reform Public Administration, which is 
funded entirely by UNDP.62  
 
The Burundi Revenue Authority (OBR) is one of the only agencies to spearhead movement towards 
more transactional services. The OBR has undertaken several initiatives to improve national tax and 
customs administration, in a bid to increase domestic revenue mobilization . As part of this,  the OBR 
has deployed an IT system for the registration of taxpayers, SIGTAS, which is connected to the 
ASYCUDA World  system for customs administration (detailed above). Taxpayers are registered and 
identified using a unique tax ID number, which allows the system to communicate the key taxpayer 
data to both the tax and customs commissions. The IT department of the OBR has also deployed a 
complete national and urban communications network, connecting all OBR-websites. However, a 
diagnostic assessment conducted in 2018 found that the data in the taxpayer registry is often 
inconsistent, unreliable and incomplete, as no automated accounting system exists for other key tax 
functions such as the filing of taxes and tracking of large tax arrears.63 In terms of user engagement, 
OBR’s website is rich in information, and enables the user to download various forms to process their 
taxes. Users can also check the validity of vehicle registration certificates on the OBR’s website, as 
well as the validity of their tax ID number.

Several MDAs have also started to leverage digital payment platforms as a means of enabling digital 
services delivery.  Moving forward, new digital financial services, particularly available payments 
platforms, will need to be leveraged to support the end-to-end digitization of public services, by 
enabling broader use of online payments for services. The latest available data from 2014 shows that 
only three percent of Burundians received payments from the Government, half of which concern 
salaries paid to civil servants. However, stakeholder consultations suggest that both uptake of mobile 
money, and use of digital payments platforms by government has since increased. Several solutions 
were released in recent years, which have contributed to the mainstreaming of Government-to-Person 
(G2P) and Person-to-Government (P2G) payments for public utilities, tax and social transfers, including 
safety nets and subsidy schemes.  While there is ample scope for further scaling (discussed further in 
Chapter 6) further digitization and consolidation of key databases and registries will be needed to 
facilitate this – e.g. a more robust foundational ID and integrated social registry systems for safety 
nets payments. 
 
Overall, developing more transactional services will 
require further investment in shared enabling 
infrastructure and services, including enabling 
platforms such as a robust ID system, which help 
improve interoperability. These issues are 
discussed further below

the importance of developing more robust e-

still poorly equipped to offer such services,

progress has been made on back-end 
systems.  obtain information, voice concerns, and interact with their governments, these technologies can help 
strengthen trust and reinforce the social contract between Government and citizens. As discussed, 
MDAs mostly use their websites for one-way communication and information-sharing.  
 
Few, if any, consultations are conducted online to inform decision-making and improve service 
delivery. The Isôko platform has developed a survey module, as of June 2020, it has not yet been 
deployed, users are only able to leave comments on the website. Some MDAs have started using social 
media to engage with their beneficiaries, however with low levels of social media usage – 4.5 percent 
– Government is unlikely to reach a vast online audience.  Local uptake of social media is discussed 
further below.   
 
While Burundi’s Institute of Statistics and Economic Research (ISTEEBU), has launched a nascent 
open data initiative, the country lacks a coherent policy, legal and governance framework to enable a 
vibrant open data ecosystem. As noted above, initiatives that aim to maximize the amount of 
information available online exist, but  the Government does not have a published policy on open data 
that is based on international practices.  Burundi is also the only East African Community (EAC) country 
that does not have a specific law on access to information, moreover, there are no specific laws on 
government data archiving and preservation. The Statistical Law of 2007 did confer the role of 
centralizing and preserving all the statistical data placed within Ministries, Departments, Agencies 
(MDAs) and public and parastatal enterprises, with the Burundi’s Institute of Statistics and Economic 
Research (ISTEEBU). With donor support, ISTEEBU has engaged in capacity building activities for its 
staff, developed its second National Strategy for Statistical Development and improved its connectivity 
enabling ISTEEBU to disseminate some data on its website. Burundi thus made significant progress in 
the WB’s Statistical Capacity Score indicator, as evidenced by Figure 5.2 below.64 A lack of digital data, 
collected, shared and centrally stored with government continues to hamper the existing Open Data 
initiative.  
 
 
In 2017, the open data platform, IMIS Burundi65, was developed by ISTEEBU – yet its use remains 
limited. The platform is presented as “an integrated system for managing socio-demographic and 
economic data” with the objective “to provide users with a national, reliable database, allowing, among 
other things, the generation of relevant indicators” and to “centralize, merge, process and render 
information in real-time.” However, the use of the platform remains limited, partly due to limited 
knowledge of its existence among key contributors and user-groups, but also due to the quality of the 
data available. Further efforts are needed to improve the quality, reliability and regularity of the data 
 
64 The Statistical Capacity Score can be interpreted as a proxy for a country’s capacity to implement Open Data 
policies. See https://opendatawatch.com/blog/indexes-of-data-quality-and-openness/

Burundi Central African Republic Congo, Dem. Rep. Congo, Rep.being produced, as well as ensuring that said data is made available in standardized, machine-
readable formats. This will require stronger institutional and policy coordination (e.g. open data focus 
points in key MDAs). In sum, there is still ample scope to harness open data for improved policy making 
and to promote access to information that can support innovation on the private sector side, which is 
discussed further in Chapter 2.  
Burundi thus still has a very long way to go in terms of creating a vibrant and enabling data ecosystem, 
which can harness the power of big data, or AI.  Developing Open Data policies is a useful first step in 
encouraging innovation in collaboration with citizens and businesses.  
 
 
Progress has been made in connecting disparate MDA via the “COMGOV” network, which provides 
government with broadband. The project was launched in 2013 and is implemented by BBS. The 
advance bulk purchase of wholesale capacity from BBS was financed by the WB RCIP-2 project. 60 
different MDAs are provided with 100Mbps of IP-internet and 440 Mbps of national transmission 
bandwidth via a shared network. Nevertheless, many MDAs still lack adequate access to broadband, 
particularly local government. 
 
There are no shared data hosting solutions being leveraged. Government lacks a shared cloud and no 
shared government data center exists . Instead, many choose to leverage their own servers and data 
centers, making intra-government data exchange difficult. For example, the Burundi Revenue Office 
(OBR), the Central Bank and the Presidency all have their own data centers. The Burundi Backbone 
System (BBS) is currently home to a national data center, which many other public agencies leverage 
to backup their systems. While the IFMIS systems was developed using a cloud-based solution for data 
hosting, the cloud is not used by other MDAs, and weak ability to connect to the system, particularly 
locally, is severely limiting its impact.  
 
Re-using and sharing data effectively, through shared data hosting, will be key to developing more 
integrated e-service capacity.  
 
As noted above, there is limited interoperability between systems, and weak use of shared services. 
Interoperability layers and shared services generally help to facilitate secure data transfer, storage 
and exchange, leveraging common resources across disparate hardware devices, communication 
networks, cloud providers, operating systems, applications, and interfaces. Shared services and 
interoperable systems can thus reduce the administrative burden experienced by citizens and 
businesses, but also facilitate the work of civil servants themselves. These systems improve real-time 
information sharing across institutions, while also enabling the principle of “ask-once” data policies, 
where government never requests information more than once from its constituents. Interoperability 
layers and shared services are thus key to supporting service integration and greater resource 
efficiency. This would allow the government to reduce the duplication of resources across agencies, 
streamline and automate business processes and leverage economies of scale. The failure to adopt a 
whole-of-government approach to the e-government program in Burundi is partially to blame for a lack 
of shared systems, services and gaps in shared infrastructure. Other factors contributing to weak 
interoperability are explored in Table 5.3.   
 Organizational   Lack of a single centralized agency coordinating and managing the 
implementation of ICT projects for all ministries and public agencies  
 Lack of enforcement of the Ministry of ICT and the Regulator’s policies and 
guidelines  
 Resistance and reluctance to change to new processes and data 
management due to the fear of loss of control by administrative officials 
 Lack of additional budget allocation to introduce new activities outside the 
conventional program  
Semantic   Heterogeneity of information systems, operating systems and hardware  
 Legacy systems 
 No standard formats for data archiving and exchange  
Technical   Non-availability of ICT infrastructure at the data/component/service level 
 Legacy systems, process and data with disparate technology 
 Many public agencies have developed their own websites in silos  
 
Some systems have attempted to leverage shared infrastructure between a network of MDA, but these 
systems only help form pockets of interoperability, not across government. The Guichet Unique 
Provincial (GUP) relies on a connectivity network shared between several agencies (including  Air, 
Borders and Foreigners Police and the Judicial Police) to deliver biometric documents. Similarly, in the 
tax and customs sectors, a shared connectivity network is leveraged, allowing Customs and Tax offices 
to view information on a taxpayer in a unified and integrated manner.  
 
Burundi currently lacks trust services such as a foundational digitally enabled identification system 
and electronic certificates, critical to facilitating secure online transactions. Trust in a person or an 
entity’s identity is a cornerstone of economic and social transactions.  The emergence of the digital 
economy has created a need for verifiable digital identity credentials. Digital ID systems facilitate the 
secure identification and authentication of a person, entity or device - both in person and/or online - 
and bind the user of an online transaction with their “real world” or legal identity. Combined with digital 
certificate services (e.g. public-key infrastructure (PKI), they are also the basis for e-signatures, which 
enable acknowledgement, approval, acceptance, or obligation to be indicated without physical 
presence. Developing these services is critical to supporting growth in digital transactions. 
 
 
The national ID system in Burundi continues to be paper-based.  While IDs are issued to citizens 16 
and older by the Ministry of Interior, in the absence of centralized digital foundational database the 
present system fails to issue unique ID numbers, In 2013, the country launched a pilot project to issue 
biometric and machine-readable national ID smartcards, but the project was never rolled-out 
nationwide and was later cancelled.  The piloted card contained the cardholder’s name, sex, date of 
birth, province, commune, address, parents’ names, children’s names, bank account, signature, 
education, marital status, medical assistance information, fingerprint, and blood group.66 The national 
ID smartcard would cost 6,000 BIF (about 3 dollars USD). Registrations for the new ID card started in 
Bujumbura and a nationwide rollout was planned for 2017, however, the 2015 crisis interrupted roll-
out. The Ministry of Interior awarded the contract to produce the national ID smartcards to an Indian 
firm, but following the crisis was suspended due to a lack of funds. Consultations suggest that the 
project was ill-conceived, failed to include key stakeholder and align with global best practice.67

has been issuing biometric driving licenses since 2016, and East African Community passport with 
biometric technology since 2018. Obtaining these documents requires applicants to be physically 
present at the relevant offices for fingerprints and, up until 2017, these documents could only be 
obtained in Bujumbura, which severely hampered access. As noted above, these documents can now 
be obtained locally in 10 more provinces. 
 
There is no CERT or SOC currently in place to detect and respond to possible threats.  However, a CERT 
is currently being established, hosted by the telecom’s regulator, which still needs to be equipped and 
would benefit from further technical assistance.  
 
Limited infrastructure and connectivity:  As discussed in Chapter 3, access to the internet (both fixed 
and mobile) remains a major constraint to enabling citizens’ access public digital platforms. The issue 
is especially challenging outside of Bujumbura. Even government offices suffer from connectivity 
issues, especially at the subnational level. Many municipalities and local government offices have 
weak access to connectivity (with some notable exceptions like OBR office) – and will likely prevent 
the effective decentralization of e-service delivery. About 20 percent of civil servants are estimated to 
have computers, but no full inventory exists.  
 
Lack of institutional coordination and whole-of-government approach : While some institutions have 
been given a mandate to support the implementation of ICT projects and the development of digital 
platforms, little coordination is taking place in practice. Sectoral agencies are implementing projects 
without involving SETIC, which is severely impacting the quality and effectiveness of these initiatives 
and thus limits opportunities to development interoperable and cost-effective systems. 
 
A scant legal and policy framework : Digital platforms require strong legal and regulatory environments, 
standards and frameworks, privacy- and security-enhancing design measures. However, Burundi has 
no regulations in place for data protection and security, the archiving and preservation of digital data 
and the ownership and licensing of government data, nor has it developed policies for open data and 
access to public information and to ensure interoperability between government systems and 
databases. The Ministry in charge of ICT has developed a law on electronic communications and 
transactions that would significantly impact the development of private digital platforms, but as of 
March 2020 has not been adopted.  
 
Insufficient government capacity for maintenance and sustainability and lack of digital literacy among 
citizens: As noted in the proceeding chapter, both a digitally competent workforce and digitally literate 
citizens are needed to sustain a digital economy. MDAs in Burundi largely lack the capacity to properly 
sustain their back-office and service delivery platforms without external support while large segments 
of the population lack the means and skills to meaningfully engage with and reap benefits from such 
platforms. There is both a continuum and a mix of digital skills required to support the emergence and 
sustenance of a digital economy, and in Burundi, there is a need for those already in and coming into 
government to have at least an intermediate68 level of proficiency with digital skills, and for the majority 
of the population to develop foundational proficiency69 to enable access to related services. 
 
Lack of involvement of citizens in the design and use of public digital platforms : The development of 
public digital platforms in Burundi remains largely guided by the need to provide information to users, 
and has not yet shifted to the need and potential of providing citizens with ways to systematically 
provide feedback for improved design and service delivery. Most G2C platforms consist of

understanding contents.” UNESCO Digital Literacy Global Framework. 
69 Defined as being able to “with guidance, deal with simple tasks that involve remembering contents and 
instructions.” UNESCO Digital Literacy Global Framework. informational websites and the rare service delivery platforms have also been developed without the 
input of potential users to ensure ease of use and uptake.  
 
Funding and donor coordination:  Burundi has historically relied heavily on external and donor funding, 
much of which was suspended following the 2015 crisis, interrupting progress on a handful of e-
government initiatives. Funding needs remain high as well, alongside donor support to implement 
initiatives, which also raises issues of sustainability. However, heavy reliance on donor funding in this 
area, also raised issues around effectivity coordination. Donors needs to ensure that vertical initiatives 
piloted are aligned with wider efforts to boost interoperability.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Legislation and standardization : The East African Community (EAC) has adopted a modern and 
effective regional harmonized framework for cyberlaws. Burundi should build on that to develop its 
legislation and could also use the existing laws of EAC member States on access to information as 
a blueprint. In addition, partner states are cooperating to establish ICT infrastructure as well as for 
the development and deployment of standardized technologies and services. 
 
Integration : The EAC has developed a few integrated platforms aimed at facilitating trade among 
member countries and providing useful information to support the businesses, health services and 
overall development in the region. The Trade Information Portal comes in support to one-stop border 
shops that have been recently set up and are strengthening cross-border trade.  
 
Skills: Under the EAC objective to develop a harmonized educational approach to address regional 
needs, there is an opportunity for Burundi to avail itself of technological research and tools from 
more advanced countries, and train its people in the skills needed to foster platforms development 
and meet the demands of the Digital economy  In 2018, Burundi ranked 147 out of 151 in the UNCTAD B2C E-commerce Index.  The development of 
a vibrant platforms ecosystems on the private sector side, capable of improving market access, faces 
stark demand-side constraints. Low internet uptake, compounded by a low electricity access rate ( 7 
percent) and low GNI per capita ($280 in 2018), yield low demand for services offered online.70 While 
internet and mobile phone penetration have increased, private sector platforms including e-commerce 
are still in their infancy. And while, a series of e-commerce platforms have been launched, many have 
failed to survive, given the challenging market conditions faced. Attempts to foster a more vibrant e-
commerce industry in Burundi, thus starts with increasing the number of consumers online.  
 
Digital platform usage among MSMEs remains very low and is mainly limited to mobile payments 
platforms. The vast majority of MSMEs surveyed as part of the diagnostic do use digital payments 
services to either transfer money or receive payments for goods and services provided. The use of 
digital platforms such as e-commerce, however, remains very low. Many of the MSMEs surveyed had 
little comprehension of what e-commerce platforms have to offer. Any effort to spearhead growth in e-
commerce will require sensitizing users on the potential for reaching new consumers, increasing digital 
skills and boosting the ICT adoption capacity of MSMEs in Burundi.  
 
MSMEs that have attempted to create digital platforms have not been successful to date. These have 
had little success and payment service providers have shown limited interest in working with MSMEs. 
As a result, telecom operators, banks and payment service providers (PSPs) prefer to offer services to 
larger clients such as Regideso, Burundi’s national utility company.71 
 
The World Economic Forum (WEF) ranked Burundi last out of 139 countries for the use of virtual social 
networks in 2016. Facebook remains one of the most used social media platforms in Burundi, but 
uptake only at mere 4.6 percent (Table 5.5), reflecting the low use of data services overall. In the past, 
social media has been subject to shut down and censorship in Burundi according to the Open 
Observatory of Network Interference.72 The use of the professional social network LinkedIn is one of 
the lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, with only 0.4 percent of the population registered on the network.

In Burundi, the small market size and concentration of economic activity in Bujumbura has created an 
environment where entrepreneurs rely on a brick-and-mortar business rather than adding an online 
dimension to their services. Between 2017 and 2019, E-soko was Burundi’s largest online ecommerce 
platform before its demise. E-soko, along with other smaller local e-commerce platforms that launched 
in 2017 and 2018 such as Burundiship and Kugasoko, all shut down in 2019 due to market failures 
discussed further in Section 5.2.6 below. 
 
Despite these market challenges, e-commerce has high growth potential in Burundi. As noted in 
Chapter 4, a growing userbase and Burundi’s large youth population are clear assets to engage further 
in the development of e-commerce platforms. While, familiarity with mobile money remains low, and 
there is ample opportunity to meet consumers’ needs through products such as mobile credit, mobile

commerce models.  
 
The limited number of tech hubs has been a factor in the slow growth of home-grown, innovative 
platforms entering the market.  As discussed in Chapter 7, Burundi’s only tech hub, BujaHub, has 
largely contributed to the small number of innovative platforms and startups which are slowly on the 
rise.  
 
Finally, the use of agricultural digital platforms can significantly reduce the costs associated with 
market access and decision making for Burundi’s farmer population. Around 90 percent of Burundi’s 
population are small holder farmers, who can benefit from such solutions. Digital platforms in 
agriculture can significantly reduce the costs associated with linking small scale farmers with buyers. 
They can improve information symmetry between farmers and middlemen, helping farmers make more 
informed decisions on resource management, thus making small-scale producers more productive 
and competitive.  
 
Nascent e-commerce companies in Burundi have faced significant growth challenges, in part due to 
last-mile logistics, a culture of face-to-face transactions, and low transaction volumes . This has led to 
most e-commerce ventures closing down after a few years of operations. Most constraints faced in the 
development of digital platforms echo the demand-side constraints discussed in Section 3.2.4, 
showing that there is a vicious cycle between the low demand, lack of skills and production of digital 
content, and slow growing enabling infrastructure that hampers the development of digital solutions. 
This is further constrained by the lack of regulatory framework on cybersecurity and inexistence of 
trust services such as digital ID and electronic certificates, which significantly reduce the perception 
of potential benefits availed from digital transformation. 
 
Low purchasing power remains a key constraint despite the growth in mobile penetration. When 
considering the cost of an entry-level mobile-cellular plan in relation to the generalized average income 
of the population, Burundi ranked 193 out of 196 countries on unaffordability of mobile services.73 
Thus, price remains an obstacle for further mobile-cellular adoption in the majority rural population. 
 
User awareness and confidence in digital platform transactions remains very low, particularly for e-
commerce. E-commerce CEOs surveyed indicated that consumers have little confidence in purchasing 
products online. The vast majority of users did not trust the digital platform process and CEOs noted 
that while websites had relatively high views, the conversion rate from viewing page to actual 
purchases was less than 0.1 percent74. The few sales recorded were primarily B2C transactions where 
the end user was already familiar with the retail shop that posted the product on the platform.  
 
There is a lack of collaboration between major telecom providers and digital entrepreneurs, hampering 
the implementation of digital platforms and online payments services. According to consultations with 
e-commerce CEOs, the major telecom providers refused to work with their respective platforms to 
facilitate online payments. One of the reasons cited in particular was that telecom providers did not 
trust their own cybersecurity systems, and thus viewed sharing part of their online payment interface 
very risky, fearing potential exposure to cyberattacks on their respective companywide interfaces. 
Indeed, Burundi currently does not have any policy or standards around cybersecurity, and businesses 
cannot confirm that they meet requisite levels of safety in their electronic transactions.  
 
The prohibitive costs of logistics and transport in Burundi has adversely impacted MSMEs engaging in 
e-commerce services and push up prices for consumers, further deterring them from engaging in e-
commerce . Many local SMEs and start-ups are thus denied the opportunity to scale up their activities 
through digital solutions. However, even larger companies are affected by the low volumes of order 
 
73 Global ICT prices, International Telecommunication Union (ITU), www.itu.int 
74 Interview with leading digital firms E-Soko, InterImmo, Jumia Burundi. and delivery, which reduce their ability to capitalize on economies of scale. While scale enables the 
digital platform models to function, transport infrastructure does not enable them to reach a critical 
scale of operations.75 Moreover, many e-commerce traders have noted that the shipping costs often 
supersede the value of the products, reducing the value proposition for customers.  
 
Many Burundians remain hesitant to buy goods and services online, especially from unknown, small 
vendors. Most online sales are usually B2C from vendors that the consumers are already familiar with. 
with poor reverse logistics and returns policies discouraging commerce. Consequently,  Burundians 
typically insist on payment post-delivery to determine that products are delivered, as advertised, which 
adds to the logistics costs and poses a financial challenge for SMEs that complete the order, but also 
reduces the scope of developing digital financial services (DFS).76 
 
Both the challenges faced by Burundi in the development of digital platforms, and proposed solutions, 
remain at the foundational level, with many prerequisites still needed to be in place. Digital public 
service delivery is only nascent, and content is mostly informational. The SETIC, which should be in 
charge of accompanying these efforts across all services of the Government, lacks the capacity to act 
as a leader of digital transformation. The lack of a centralized digital ID system hampers the 
development of both public and private platforms and compromises the safety of electronic 
transactions.

health sector, but there are no systematic

The following recommendations could support the development of digital platforms in Burundi:  
 
 
R1. Develop a separate, user-driven and costed e-Government Strategy with prioritized objectives. 
Burundi is currently relying on its National ICT development policy to guide e-Government efforts and 
develop public digital platforms. The country would however gain from developing a separate and 
focused e-Government Strategy that is guided by users’ needs and identifies and prioritizes platforms 
to be strengthened and developed. That prioritization could be informed by criteria such as 
beneficiaries’ (both government and citizens) needs and the potential for significant impact on 
people’s lives, cost-benefit analysis given limited resources, and likelihood of implementation. The 
estimation of the costs to implement and sustain the priority initiatives and the determination of 
potential sources of funding would be an integral part of making such a Strategy operational.  
 
R2. Align with and build on the legal and policy regime of the East African Community regarding the 
data governance, e-Government, competition and intellectual property. The EAC has developed a 
modern regional harmonized framework for cyberlaws for e-Government and e-Commerce which focus 
on electronic transactions, electronic signature and authentication, data protection and privacy, 
consumer protection and computer crime. All member countries have committed to enacting this 
framework, and Burundi should build on this. Although the country has been an active participant in 
the years-long process of developing such a harmonized framework, it lags behind other countries in 
the region in terms of legislation development and adoption. On access to information, Burundi could 
use the existing laws of EAC member states as a blueprint, while remaining cognizant of the gaps that 
exist in those laws so they can be addressed.  
 
R3. In the short term, develop a decree with the main purpose of creating an authority body 
responsible for setting up and managing the Burundian National Identification System.  In the short 
term, the prerogatives of this Authority need to be identified. In the medium term, a comprehensive 
law covering in a comprehensive manner all aspects related to the establishment of the National 
Burundian Identification System needs to be drafted. The term authority is used to designate the entity 
that will oversee setting up and managing the Burundian National Identification System. The selection 
of this entity’s legal form ,and the body to which it would be attached is the responsibility of the 
Presidency of the Republic.   
R4. Strengthen and enforce the mandate of SETIC and institutional coordination for implementation. 
Enforce the mandate of the ministry in charge of ICT and SETIC in particular with regard to coordinating 
and overseeing the implementation of major ICT projects. That mandate should be reaffirmed and 
communicated to the MDAs from the highest levels of government, as well as the involvement of SETIC 
made a condition for financing the implementation of such projects from the design phase. 
Strengthened coordination would also promote the pooling of already limited resources among MDAs 
and reduce the duplication of resources while allowing to tackle issues of interoperability and 
interconnectivity upstream. In addition and in parallel, SETIC’s capacity to carry out its mandate 
(staffing, funding, technical expertise) needs to be strengthened.   
 
R5. Promote capacity transfers from the international and regional private sector and mobilize line 
managers. As we have seen, the development and management of digital public platforms in Burundi 
has been mostly financed through donor funding and implemented by international entities with little 
transfers of capacity. The GoB can play an important role in fostering links between multinational and 
regional companies and the domestic private sector, to facilitate technology development and transfer 
of knowledge and skills; as well as embed such capacity transfer programs in government initiatives 
for the maintenance and sustainability of digital public platforms.  
 At the minimum, government officials should be expected and trained to acquire intermediate 
levels of digital proficiency. Burundi can avail itself the expertise, training and tools available 
from more advanced countries notably under the cooperation with the EAC.  
 At the levels of the MDAs, the involvement of line managers is insufficient, and many 
government officials underestimate the extent of changes that will be required for to implement 
effective and operational digital platforms. Early and effective involvement of those managers, 
including at the local levels, with the related training is important.  
 
R6. Promote digital literacy and a citizen-centric approach to design and implementation. Existing 
digital platforms, which in their majority consist of websites or back-office systems, should allow users 
to provide feedback and download their relevant forms and documents. Consultation and feedback 
mechanisms to involve users upstream in the design of platforms aimed at service delivery especially 
(G2G, G2B, G2C) should be pursued in order to prioritize services needing digitization, especially in 
the operationalization of high-stake initiatives (such as in taxation). They should ideally be iterative to 
encourage user friendly designs and improvements in the services offered and could be as simple as 
online feedback forms for users. Investments in basic digital literacy training will be important, but 
also in more advanced skills to become digital creators, focusing especially on the youth and women 
to close the digital gaps. The government should explore partnerships with the private sector and 
NGOs, especially those already operating in that realm, to scale up initiatives. All these initiatives would 
also help increase the overall low levels of public digital platforms’ uptake.  
 
R7. Set up incentives structure that encourage the country’s telecom operators to engage with MSMEs 
and digital platform stakeholders. The Government can encourage local sourcing through moderate 
financial tax incentives and support the organization of professional networks with tech startups, CSOs 
and digital incubators in the country and at the EAC level. It will be important to assess the cost/benefit 
equation of any incentive structures, in order to ensure their viability.  
 
 
R8. Invest in interconnectivity. Lack of interconnectivity between relevant MDAs and even the ability 
among government offices of the same institutions to access a given platform from their respective 
locations, remains a major foundational obstacle to the development of effective, efficient, integrated and interoperable public digital platforms that needs to be addressed. This would require investments 
in reliable internet access at central and decentralized levels of government, and a continued 
deployment of efficient network infrastructure to interconnect government offices. BBS has much 
contributed to this objective through their support of a national fiber optic network build-out, 
deployment of the COMGOV network, and the interconnection of several government agencies and 
offices. However more investments will be needed, notably the support of international and regional 
donors and partners.  
 
R9. Develop technical standards for data management and interoperability frameworks. Few of the 
public sector applications and platforms developed can interact or interoperate with one another even 
when there are clear benefits; there is a proliferation of incompatible systems and infrastructure 
among MDAs. To enhance coherence and facilitate the exchange of information, technical and 
regulatory standards are needed for data management, processing and protection (including formats 
for data exchanges and archiving) and interoperability frameworks defined to converge relevant digital 
platforms (for example, the current HR MIS would gain from being interoperable with the line 
ministries’ HR systems) as well as with relevant third parties. For example, the revenue administration 
authority being able to have automated links not just with commercial banks but telecoms and utilities 
companies to verify taxpayer information.  
 
R10. Secure resources for the implementation of digital ID systems. Efforts to develop safe and secure 
digital ID systems and can allow users’ identity verification are important in fostering trust in the 
transactions undertaken both in person and online. Burundi’s undertakings in this realm and 
specifically in digitizing the most used and available form of ID in the country, the national ID (a priority 
under the PNDTIC policy of building and effective and efficient government) have been stalled due to 
lack of funding. Given its immediate potential in facilitating transactions in both the public and private 
sectors domains, and in the longer term doing business, and as Burundi further ensures its future 
digital economy, the country should resume and secure funding for those efforts. In this process, the 
country can learn from its neighbor Rwanda, which has developed one of the strongest foundational 
national ID systems in Africa . 
 
R11. Prioritize the development of a digital identity and electronic signatures ecosystem – with the 
aim of rolling-out a system that is aligned with global best practice and recognized regionally. A trusted 
and inclusive digital ID system would accelerate growth in Burundi’s digital economy by enabling 
citizens and residents to undertake trusted transactions online, allowing more services to be digitized. 
Furthermore, if recognized across borders, particularly in its current East Africa Region, such a digital 
identity system will boost the competitiveness of Burundi in regional and global digital trade. For 
example, registering businesses or entering contracts in other countries without needing to be 
physically present. As part of this process Government is encouraged to review its approach to the 
national ID system. Specific recommendations include:  
 First develop a clear and detailed policy and strategy, which will provide clarity on the purposes 
and features of the ID system. Importantly, this should be informed by comprehensive 
consultations with the public, civil society and experts 
 Introduce an enabling law, based on said policy and strategy and a data protection law aligned 
with international best practices (more on this below). 
 Adopt international best practices and norms in the design of the system (e.g. the ten Principles 
on Identification for Sustainable Development) - with a stronger emphasis on use cases, 
credentials and authentication.  
 Address challenges with the overlapping institutional arrangements on identity, including 
between the National Registration Bureau and the Department of Civil registration.  
 Play a leadership role and encourage dialogue on the reciprocal recognition of digital IDs in the 
East African region and African continent more broadly, including facilitating movement towards 
a single digital market. While Burundi has very limited experience it can significantly benefit from 
technical regional spill overs from more ICT advanced economies such as Kenya.  Carry out a comprehensive information and education campaign to raise awareness and to 
proactively address public concerns in relation to national ID. 
 
R12. Improving the Cybersecurity Institutional Framework by reducing fragmentation, promoting 
clear mandates and building capacity of relevant agencies. Among priority recommendation are: 
 A refresh of the Cybersecurity Strategy and Policy and the amendment of the cybersecurity 
legislative framework. 
 A consensus-based institutional and governance structure for cybersecurity across relevant 
MDAs. 
 The formulation of National Guidelines for the Protection of Critical National Information 
Infrastructure. 
 The development of compliance standards and compliance enforcement for cybersecurity 
across public, private and civil sectors. 
 The formulation of a trust and transparency framework. 
 Targeted capacity building in cybersecurity for specific audiences, including technical 
cybersecurity officials but also spanning managerial-level decision makers, non-technical end-
users of government systems, police officers, judges and prosecutors and legislators. 
  
 
 
 
Digital financial services (DFS) include a broad range of financial products such as payments, credit, 
savings, remittances and insurance that can be accessed and delivered using digital channels (like 
mobile phones, internet, ATMs, debit and credit cards, biometric devices, tablets, and any other digital 
or electronic system) . 77 DFS enables individuals, private businesses, and the government to access 
all these services without the need to visit a bank branch or deal directly with the financial service 
provider (FSP).78 DFS typically leverages networks of third-party intermediaries and agents to foster 
accessibility and lower the cost of delivery. DFS providers are thus often able to offer wider service 
coverage than traditional brick-and-mortar FSPs.  
 
By leveraging technologies, such as mobile phone-enabled solutions, DFS can expand the delivery of 
basic financial services to Burundi’s poor and underserved populations , helping to boost financial 
inclusion , with positive ripple effects on employment, poverty reduction79 as well as access to markets 
and services. The explosion of mobile money in SSA has been instrumental in expanding financial 
inclusion on the continent. Research shows that DFS allows countries to leapfrog, as they implement 
new payment technology, even when a large part of the population does not have access to traditional 
financial services.80

79 In 2016 research was conducted on the long-term impact of M-PESA on Kenyan households, which found 
that increased access to M-PESA agents significantly reduced both extreme poverty (income lower than 
US$1.25 per day) and general poverty (US$2). M-PESA availability was correlated with proximity of agents. 
Access to DFS was directly associated with lifting 194,000 Kenyan households, or 2 percent, out of extreme 
poverty.

and MENA’s Place in the World.  Policy Research Working Paper 9104. 

 
 Wider access to DFS can help strengthen the enabling environment for private sector growth as well 
as supporting public service expansion. For example, Governments can leverage DFS to increase the 
efficiency and accountability in their payment stream, such as the  disbursement of social transfers, 
receipt of tax payments, as well as routine payments for services from businesses and citizens. DFS 
can thus help to expand the delivery cash-based assistance to the poor. 81 This service delivery 
modality is  particularly resonant in the face of COVID-19, where there is a need to support contactless 
transactions.  
 
Both the Government of Burundi and the Central Bank, the  Banque de la Republique du Burundi  (BRB) 
recognize the importance of expanding financial inclusion - yet fail to fully recognize the role that DFS 
can play in this regard. In 2015, the Government issued a National Financial Inclusion Strategy, which 
sought to improve access to financial services in rural areas by supporting microfinance institutions 
(MFIs). The role of DFS in this strategy was limited to money transfers. Sadly, this strategy was never 
implemented, as its steering committee was under-resourced. In 2018, the BRB launched a second 
National Financial Inclusion Strategy; as 
part of this process, the BRB organized 
several workshops with central banks of 
other African nations to facilitate 
knowledge exchange on financial inclusion 
and related best practice. In this second 
strategy, the BRB identified two major 
bottlenecks in expanding financial 
inclusion in Burundi: (i) weak access to 
service points in rural areas, where a 
majority of the population continues to 
reside; more than half of existing access 
points found in Bujumbura; and (ii) a lack 
of awareness among consumers around to 
key financial products and services 
available (Figure 6.1).  
 
Many of the strategic commitments made as part of the second National Financial Inclusion Strategy 
have failed to materialize. A Financial Inclusion Unit was set up within the Supervision Department of 
the BRB, staffed with four people. The Unit has mainly been active in collecting data from FSPs (banks 
and non-banks) to track the state of financial inclusion. Theoretically, the Unit is also responsible for 
delivering capacity-building to FSPs in support of the creation of appropriate products and services 
targeting the financially excluded. However, the Unit appears ill-equipped to perform this task and 
would benefit from learning from the lessons of other countries, and understanding how these might 
apply to Burundi.  
 
 
Access to traditional financial services has largely been restricted to urban residents with formal 
employment.  According to the 2014 Global Findex figures, a mere 4 percent of adults were saving 
money using formal financial tools and services. Moreover, while some 60 percent of adults had 
borrowed money within the past year, only 2 percent had done so through formal channels.

The most recent data available from the Global Findex survey suggests that Burundi’s levels of 
financial inclusion are among the lowest in SSA  – only prevailing over Central African Republic (CAR), 
Niger, and Guinea. Between 2011 and 2014, the number of adults with an account at a formal 
financial institution decreased from 7.2 to 6.9 percent (Figure 6.1). With only 4.1 percent of the 
population having made or received a digital payment in 2014, Burundi has one of the lowest levels 
of DFS usage on the continent (see Table 6.1).  
 
Adults with a bank account, % (2014)  6.9 28.8 
Adults with a mobile money account, % (2014)  0.7 11.7 
Adults using digital payment, % (2014)  4.1 22.7

Domestic remittance sent or received via digital channels, % of total domestic 
remittance (2014)  6.1 25.6 
 
However, recent incursions made by mobile money and in-country studies undertaken suggest that 
this may be changing. A 2018 survey conducted by the World Bank shows that half of respondents 
surveyed had access to mobile money.82 The survey reports a similar percentage for the use of digital 
payments.83 These improvements can be attributed to the expansion in mobile money services and 
enabling regulatory reforms, alongside relaxing the provisions for mobile money services.  
 
Data from the BRB confirms that DFS access has been increasing significantly over the last few years . 
As of March 2018, the BRB recorded 1.28 million digital payment transactions, placing Burundi on par 
with many of its regional peers. As of December 2019, financial inclusion levels were estimated to be 
around 20 percent, according to the Financial Inclusion Unit of the BRB.84 By September 2019, there 
were some 4,034,628 recorded mobile money users, of which roughly 21 percent were thought to be 
active. Overall, some 1,803 mobile money merchants and 59,529 registered agents powered an 
annualized value of $308 USD million in 2019, representing ~9 percent of GDP. These figures are 
indicative of the growing role that DFS can play in accelerating service expansion and fueling economic 
growth.  
 
The provision of DFS is dominated by mobile money service providers in Burundi. The mobile money 
market has been increasing since Lumicash entered the market in 2017. In the period that followed, 
the number of active mobile money users grew ten-fold.(see Figure 6.2). Lumicash is being offered by 
the MNO Lumitel, which has adopted an aggressive rural expansion strategy.  
 
There are currently three mobile money service providers in the country : Lumitel, Econet-Leo, and 
SmartCash. Lumitel offers LumiCash, Econet Leo offer EcoCash, Smart offers SmartPesa and Onatel 
is looking to launch OnaCash. Of the three existing providers, Lumitel and Econet-Leo cater to 99 
percent of the market. However, Lumitel market entrance was the catalyst for an explosion in DFS 
usage; competition in mobile money led to improved marketing and customer awareness, yielding a 
boost in mobile money adoption.

mobile money.  
83 It should be noted, however, that due to access and security restrictions, the results from the survey are not 
representative of Burundi’s population and cannot be interpreted as a national estimate of DFS usage in Burundi. 
84 Conversations with the Financial Inclusion Unit during the week of 10-14 February 2020 in Bujumbura. At present, a limited range of mobile 
money services are being offered , 
including simple person-to-person 
(P2P) transfers, Cash-In-Cash-Out 
(CICO) services, airtime purchase 
and other payments services. 
Lumicash offer merchant payments, 
money transfers from wallet to bank 
and from bank to wallet, as well as 
utility payments for electricity and tax 
payments.85 EcoCash also offers 
merchant payments and is working 
on both a bill payment and a banking 
integration function. Moreover, 
EcoCash supports remittances and in 
November 2018, piloted a digital 
credit product after receiving a one-
off approval from BRB .86 SmartPesa 
offers P2P transfers, merchant 
payments, CICO services, and allows customers make bulk payments such as salary disbursements. 
Smart is also planning to roll out micro credit and micro savings products through SmartPesa.  
 
The wider Fintech ecosystem is in its nascency.  A local third-party payment aggregator called PayWay 
has also emerged, providing merchant and utility payments, supporting banking and mobile money 
integration, airtime top-ups, as well as payment integration with the Burundi Revenue Service. AuxFin, 
a Belgium social enterprise, has also set-up shop in Burundi, in addition to handful of other countries. 
Focused on rural financial inclusion, the company targets farmers. Its Universal Method of Value 
Access (UMVA) offers e-banking, payments and remittances service, leveraging a technology akin to 
blockchain.87 Services offered are expanding to include the sales of crops, targeting key value chains, 
and featuring smallholder farmer clubs. 88 Auxfin is also working closely with Burundi’s vibrant 
microcredit ecosystem, under the Burundi MFI Network (RIM).89  
 
There appears to be limited uptake of DFS among banks and MFIs operating in Burundi.  While digital 
services currently on offer are a great starting point for expanding financial inclusion, as well as 
enabling growth of online transaction, deepening financial inclusion will require that more financial 
institutions support and leverage DFS to expand the local DFS service offering beyond those offered 
by mobile money providers (Figure 6.3 summarizes the DFS offering in Burundi). Burundi’s banking 
sector is made up of 10 commercial banks,90 which have been slower to embrace digital channels.  
 
The microfinance sector in Burundi currently also plays an important role in the local financial 
ecosystem.91 There are 42 MFIs in Burundi, 25 of which are members of RIM. While MFIs see the 
importance of leveraging digital solutions, weak access to electricity and management information

systems (MIS) limit their ability to leverage digital solutions.92 Scale up of G2P and P2G payments 
could play an instrumental role in supporting further services development and diversification, as well 
as encouraging greater uptake and active usage (see Box 13). 
 
 
 
 
 
92 Power cuts in rural and peri-urban areas as a major constraint. On the technical side, their MIS is inadequate  
even for basic uses such as reporting to the Central Bank, suggesting that technical capacity to implement 
digital solutions is low. •P2P transfers

•Payments totax authority
•Merchant Payments

•Remittances
While use of mobile money for G2P payments remains low in Burundi, its use appears to be on the 
rise. 2014 data from Findex shows that less than 3 percent of adults were receiving direct 
government payment. Traditionally, these payments have been pushed through brick-and-mortar 
financial institutions or made in cash. For example, as it stands, about 50 percent of G2P payments 
made to pay civil servant salaries leverage accounts with the National Postal Administration. 
However, the rise of mobile money and fintech has helped to slowly expand the use of both digital 
G2P and P2G payments: 
 
 Tax collection.  In June 2017, the OBR (tax authority) partnered with Lumicash to offer a 
mobile payments solution for paying taxes. The initiative, called “ Riha OBR na Lumicash ", 
has been positively welcomed by taxpayers.  
 Supporting farmers.  In June 2018, the Ministry of the Environment, Agriculture and 
Livestock also entered into a partnership with Lumicash to allow farmers to make payments 
for government-subsidized chemical fertilizers. This has shortened the distance that 
farmers need to travel to pay at the counters of the MFI COOPEC or the National Posts 
Administration, which are only located in the main towns of the communes. The Ministry 
has also worked with AuxFin.  
 Utility bills.  The payment aggregator PayWay has entered into a partnership agreement with 
the Regideso, the state-owned provider of water and electricity, to allow consumers to 
process their payment of electricity and water bills via their application. 
 Social Protection.  The social safety nets project (Merankabandi) is providing cash transfers 
to around 56,000 households – close to 40 percent of all households included in the 
country’s social registry – targeting the country’s poorest provinces. As part of Burundi’s 
COVID-19 response strategy, said cash transfers may be scaled up to richer urban areas, 
which are not currently part of Merankabandi. 
 
An expansion of G2P and P2G payments have the potential to constitute a strong entry point for 
further development of digital services.  Notably, the BRB reports major digital payments spikes 
around March and September time, each year, when rental tax and school fees are due. This aptly 
illustrates how uptake can be encouraged by offering digital payments options for a range strategic 
services and use -cases.  
While recent improvements in the regulatory environment have allowed for the proliferation of mobile 
money services, many factors still contribute to a poor enabling environment for DFS. Key recent 
developments include a 2017 Banking Law, which established a new type of entity called Payment 
Service Provider (PSP), clarified the rules of market engagement, and relaxed know-your-customer 
(KYC) requirements allowing customers to hold up to $50 USD in mobile money without an ID –
lowering the barrier of access for many Burundians who lack formal ID. 
 
The scale-up of related payments faces several constraints in Burundi.  These include: 
Weak development of the formal financial market  
 Weak access to mobile devices ; 
 Weak data and consumer protection, including limited measures to protect against fraud and 
data security breaches; 
 Weak access to ID required for setting up a DFS account; and 
 Growing but limited access to agents (with sufficient liquidity at access points).  
 
In 2017, the BRB promulgated a new banking law, which improved the regulatory environment for 
DFS. The law created a new licensed entity, the payment service provider (PSP), authorized to provide 
e-money transfers and other related electronic transactions. PSPs are limited to providing payment 
accounts and are not authorized to mobilize deposits beyond a limit of BIF 100,000 (or $50). The law 
allows banks, MFIs and PSPs to provide services through agents. The exact function of agents has not 
been fully expanded on by BRB, but its introduction shows promise in terms of expanding access to 
DFS.  
 
While the new law is comprehensive and significantly increases the supervisory responsibilities of the 
BRB, it is also complex. As it stands, the BRB is assumed to lack the capacity for adequate supervision, 
and could stand to benefit from further capacity building and support in implementing the new 
provisions introduced by the law. For example, BRB may wish to consider a shift toward risk-based 
supervision of authorized entities, and would require related training.93 
 
Burundi’s consumer protection regulation applies to all financial service providers, including agents 
and non-bank financial institutions.  The regulation covers disclosure and transparency requirements 
that help protect customers, as well as calling for fair treatment and business conduct. Moreover, the 
BRB appears to have the legal mechanisms in place to enforce related provisions, including fines, 
suspension of operations, or even cancelation of the operating licenses. 
 
However, legal ambiguity in several areas could create problems for consumers. For instance, the 
regulation prohibits abusive practices is relation to debt collection, without specifying what is 
considered abusive or unfair. Similarly, financial service providers are asked to protect customer data, 
using the data only in the context in which it was provided. However, the legal provisions for safely 
collecting and using said data, as well as client consent are not well-defined. When faced with legal 
ambiguity, existing regulation fails to clarify whether the law will hold – more specifically, whether it 
should side with the consumer or services provider. Finally, financial service providers have to set up 
alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, where the BRB is able to offer legal recourse and support 
for dispute resolution. These mechanisms rely only on the written submission of complaints, which 
may preclude illiterate users from access them.  
 
 
93 World Bank (2019). Driving Financial Inclusion in Burundi: State of financial intermediaries and inroad of 
mobile money.  Anti-Money Laundering and Client Due Diligence are not spelled out in detail in the 2017 banking law 
that establishes the PSP status.94 Burundi’s legislative framework in this area is broad and primarily 
covered by the Anti-Money Laundering Law of 2008, which involves any organization offering money 
transfers. This law requires that customers’ identity should be ascertained before a business is 
established; all institutions should maintain internal AML controls; and that institutions should retain 
information on all clients, including ID, for at least ten years. 
 
As noted above, other legal and regulatory gaps on issues such as data protection, cyber security etc. 
adversely affects DFS risk management. 
 
 
Formal financial institutions are interested in the DFS market but lack the knowhow and capacity to 
do so. Banks understand that being competitive in this market means that they must cater to the vast 
un-banked and underbanked population in Burundi, leveraging technology to offer more innovative 
and accessible service alternatives. A major constraint is the strong controls on foreign exchange that 
are currently in place, precluding banks from procuring the requisite foreign technology to develop 
these solutions in-house. 
 
Insufficient investment has prevented the market from achieving any major DFS breakthroughs.  Both 
financial institutions and mobile money service providers require significant time, resources and 
attention regarding product development, developing agent networks, improving performance 
management, customer education and marketing. 
 
In 2016, Burundi had about 142 ATMs and about 3.22 commercial bank branches per 100,000 
adults. 95 Bank branches are mostly found in urban areas, with over half located in Bujumbura alone - 
disproportionate to Burundi’s rural reality. Anecdotal evidence indicates that the cost of setting up a 
bank branch in Burundi is approximately $600,000 USD, making it an unattractive investment 
proposition. In this sense, an increasing network of mobile money agents has played an instrumental 
role in expanding access through DFS. 
 
It is now estimated that there are more agents providing mobile money services than there are 
traditional access points, even though a lot of these agents may be dormant.  In 2018, Econet Leo 
reportedly had some 10,000 registered agents, Lumitel had 3,500 and Smart had 1,500.96 The third-
party payment aggregator PayWay reportedly has some 400 outlets. Agent network build up and 
maintenance is a time- and resource-intensive activity. Service providers need to ensure that there is 
a strong business case for agents to onboard and start working. In addition, having a large number of 
dormant agents can cause damage to the reputation of a mobile money service provider. As it stands, 
there is ample room for further network expansion and better management. 
 
Moreover, in the absence of service and agent interoperability, the number of agents available are 
likely to be restricted. New DFS providers recruit agents independently, which can be slow and costly, 
involving expenses such as a dedicated point of sale device for the agent. In addition, the agent 
typically needs to maintain an e-money float with each organization it represents. In practice, few 
agents can afford to fund floats with many DFS providers and will focus on the two or three that yield 
the highest returns. This restricts the ability of new market entrants to gain distribution and market 
presence. Agent interoperability involves agents using a single e-money float for multiple DFS 
providers, and ideally a single point of sale device. This allows agents to support a larger number of

mobile money.   services and provide customers with more choice and more competition between providers. Agent 
interoperability is still a nascent concept but is working successfully in a few markets including 
Tanzania. A similar type of service in Burundi could expand the agent network, reduce cost of existing 
providers and expand competition for new market entrants.  
 
BRB is responsible for the oversight of the national payment system, and is the operator and owner of 
the Automated Transfer System (ATS).  The ATS comprises of the following two systems: (i) a Real-Time 
Gross Settlement system, which is responsible for final settlement of interbank obligations; and (ii) an 
Automated Clearing House, which clears retail credit transfers and electronic checks. From a technical 
perspective, the ATS is operational but not in practice - participant banks have not yet integrated their 
core systems with the ATS.  
 
BI-Switch was set up in 2018 to enable full interoperability in the financial sector but be actioned. BI-
Switch is designed to connect all bank, card, mobile and internet-based payments, starting with the 
banking sector.  In early 2019, BI-Switch’s software was upgraded to include mobile and internet-
initiated payments. Roll-out of BI-Switch is currently being piloted, via the integration of four banks, 
with a plan to eventually include mobile money service providers in this interoperability project. 
However, there have been significant delays incurred, due to capacity gaps, on all sides. As it stands, 
there is thus no interoperability between existing mobile money services, nor between mobile money 
service providers and banks – each mobile money service provider serves its own customer base 
independently.  
 
As noted above, expanding interoperability could help improve the business model for existing and 
future service providers, but also improve the customer experience and service offering.  A lack of 
interoperability tends to reinforce cash as the payment solution of choice, whereas full interoperability 
can help expand services coverage. The Association des Banques et Etablissements Financiers du 
Burundi (ABEF)97 is one of the chief architects behind BI-Switch, and along with BRB, could play a more 
hands-on role in terms of supporting further capacity building to enable swift implementation. 
 
There have been various attempts to set up a working credit registry for banks and MFIs, but most 
attempts have been thwarted by the BRB’s unwillingness to share requiste data.  The existing credit 
registry is currently limited to a semi-formal list of defaulters, or a so-called “black-list”. This database 
is wholly inadequate, as it fails to provide institutions with the data needed to properly assess credit 
risk. Moreover, not all institutions contribute to this central file, making it an unreliable source of. 
information. Setting up a private credit bureau and collateral registry was recently explored in 2017, 
however the government was unwilling to share sensitive data with a private company.  
 
In the absence of a credit bureau, there is information asymmetry which restricts financial institutions 
from extending loans to micro small and medium size enterprises (MSMEs), and households – 
effecting the enabling environment for private sector development (discussed further in the next 
chapter). A private credit bureau would provide lenders with products and services, such as credit 
reports, fraud alerts and credit scoring, supporting better credit management practices, and allowing 
lenders to share credit information, increase financial inclusion and facilitate mobility. In addition, a 
well-functioning, centralized electronic collateral registry for movable securities could give the much-
needed boost to the agricultural sector in Burundi. This would allow for the entrepreneurs and small 
farmers to obtain loans against movable securities such as agricultural equipment, future harvests, 
warehouse receipts, accounts receivables, livestock, etc. In doing so, it would contribute to the 
financial inclusion of large parts of the population currently excluded.. 
 
97 ABEF is the apex organization for commercial banks gathering ten banks and two financial institutions.  
Although demand-side data is scant, evidence available suggest that there are large pockets of unmet 
demand, where local communities remain underserved.  Financial service providers should leverage 
this demand to support further service and network expansion, while remaining sensitive to the many 
demand-side barrier that may adversely affect uptake, as well as the financial preferences of low-
income households. Notably, many traditional FSPs remain unattuned to the preferences of the 
unbanked and what they desire from a financial product.98 Further research on customer needs could 
help support the design of attractive and tailored products. Notably, the agricultural sector and the 
fledgling startup ecosystem could be key consumer groups, whom are current under-served.  
 
Mobile phone penetration is likely to be one of the most significant barriers to further DFS adoption. 
Mobile money requires only USSD functionality, constituting a basis for supporting further financial 
inclusion, using basic feature phones. However, the absence of weak smart-phone ownership is likely 
to limited innovation and the level of service sophistication that can realistically be offered to 
consumers.  Innovative financing mechanism could, for example, be leveraged to support great access 
to devices. This issue is discussed in Chapter 6.   
 
As noted in Chapter 5, Burundi still lacks a centralized unique national ID system.  Burundians 
continues to rely a variety of formal IDs such as driver’s license and passports, which are primarily 
paper based. Weak access to ID coverage is likely to be a key demand-side constraint, preventing 
consumers from opening an account. According to the World Bank Identification for Development data, 
in Burundi 73 percent of the population had a national ID in 2018. Equally, the absence of a robust 
and digitally enabled ID system significantly hinders the ability of FSPs to digitally authenticate 
transactions, connect back-end digital system (such as credit registries, social registries) to a unique 
ID, and thus developing a more enabling ecosystem for DFS expansion.   
 
Finally, weak financial and digital literacy (as noted in Chapter 4) is likely to act has a cross-cutting 
barrier. Here FSPs have a role to play, along-side government and development partners. Increasing 
the use of mobile payments could allow the population to access the formal financial systems, but 
these services raise important issues in relation to consumer protection in the absence of adequate 
financial and digital literacy - significant capacity and knowledge gaps are key binding constraints to 
wider DFS adoption. Consumers should be able to understand risks in order to make informed 
decisions. These skills will also be critical to support customer on-boarding for more sophisticated DFS 
products and services.  
 
Despite recent growth in the mobile money market and progress made on components of the 
regulatory environment, gaps remain in creating an enabling environment. On the supply side, there 
is still room for access network and service expansion. Weak access to enabling infrastructure, support 
for investment, capacity and knowledge gaps limit the ability of local industry player to support DFS 
development. While there appears to be unmet demand, several barriers hamper further uptake, 
including access to electricity, mobile device and ID ownership, as well as poor digital literacy. 
Opportunities exist to expand G2P payments and use development partners’ programs to mainstream 
digital payment solutions. Finally, data gaps prevent accurate benchmarking and understanding of 
demand, impeding service development.

The following recommendations could support the development of DFS in Burundi:  
 
 
R1. Explore scope for expanding G2P and P2G. This would not only help encourage services 
development, but also stimulate further uptake among users, if applied to key services and use-cases.  
Government could start by mapping current payment flows, and subsequently drafting a roadmap for 
gradual roll-out.   
 
R2. Digitize payments along agricultural value chains, by exploring opportunities for using DFS along 
this course This would imply that all payments for agricultural inputs, harvest, and premiums are paid 
digitally. There is opportunity to pilot in the coffee sector, where certain subsidies are already made 
through mobile money service providers. Related digitization would lead to financial inclusion for the 
farmers and enable better outcomes in terms of formal savings and in the future, credit. 
 
R3. Improve customer education and understanding of DFS. Activities to promote digital/financial 
literacy and awareness of DFS should be launched. There is scope to work with both public and private 
sector players to promote DFS and to encourage customer acquisition and usage, to demonstrate how 
investments in marketing and customer outreach can lead to positively effect customer behavior and 
business expansion.   
 
R4. Set up a National Payments Advisory Council to drive market-wide interoperability. A National 
Payments Council is necessary to coordinate payment service providers and develop a strategy for 
promoting greater interoperability in the market, as well as the use of digital payments. This could also 
act as a forum for exploring the introduction of agent interoperability.  
 
R5. Develop a modern ID system. As noted in Chapter 5, a more robust  foundational and digitally 
enabled ID system would increase access to key services, including DFS. It is also a crucial component 
in the development of many other MIS that help build-out existing retail and credit infrastructure, and 
support DFS innovation.  
 
R6. Develop a modern credit reporting system , including secured transactions and collateral registry 
reforms.  
 
 
R7. Improve the supervisory capacity for the BRB. The BRB’s recent implementation of comprehensive 
regulation around DFS has pressure on the supervisory capacity of the central bank. Assistance in 
strengthening this capacity would allow BRB to exercise greater oversight of the financial sector.  
 
R8. Partner with FIs to improve capacity. Although banks are interested in offering DFS, they are 
struggling to develop a strong value proposition. Banks require technical assistance in order to offer a 
full suite of financial services to unbanked households.  
 
R9. Build capacity to accelerated implementation of the BI-Switch and ATS . Additional capacity 
injections are needed to speed up completion of the interoperability project and integration with the 
ATS. 
 
R10. Address lingering regulatory gaps and legal ambiguity.  Related gaps introduce risk and jeopardize 
customer protection and data security.  
 
R11. Bridge existing data gaps.  The absence of reliable data creates challenges in accurately 
assessing the current state of digital financial inclusion in Burundi, including regional benchmarking.99 
While Burundi’s levels of financial inclusion are among the lowest in SSA, recent incursions made by 
mobile money, suggest that this may be changing, prompting the need for up-to-date and 
representative data. Further research, as well as wider use of consumer surveys to help FSPs enhance 
their understanding of customer behaviors, should be supported. 
 
R12. Improve the investment climate. As will be highlighted in Chapter 7, there is urgent need to 
strengthen the investment climate for financial actors in Burundi. 
 
 
 
99 While the country participated in the Findex surveys in 2011 and 2014, it was not conducted in 2017.  
 
 
 
  
As noted at the outset of this report, the agriculture sector continues to be the bulwark of Burundi’s 
economy. Burundi’s agricultural sector contributes some 29 percent to GDP, yet value addition is 
limited. The sector is currently the main source employment for a majority of Burundi, as well as critical 
to securing Burundi’s food supply and stemming mounting food insecurity. Supporting greater 
productivity and market-linkages, particularly in key value chains such as coffee, could help improve 
sectoral performance, resulting in larger yield and economic benefits.  
 
Global experience suggest that digital technology can increase productivity with economies of scale 
and make smallholder farmers more competitive in the process.  It can reduce the costs associated 
with linking producers (small-scale farmers) and buyers; reduce information asymmetry between 
smallholder farmers and middle-men; and help farmers make more precise decisions on resource 
management by improving access to information (e.g. based on weather and market data); to name 
but a few examples. Digital solutions can play an important role in the adoption of good agricultural 
and manufacturing practices, through the development of platforms and universal use of smartphones 
and internet, which enables best practices to be shared. 100 
 
Through initiatives both on and off the farm, digital technologies have the potential to increase the 
efficiency, equity and sustainability of the agricultural value chain.101 On the farm technologies can 
leverage granular data about farmers’ crops and animals, combined with information on how to exploit 
the available physical, natural and human capital most efficiently, and maximize output. Off the farm 
solutions can reduce transaction costs arising from interactions with input and output markets, as well 
as the Government. 102 
 
Several encouraging examples of effective application of technology in the agricultural sector already 
exist in Burundi, but there is scope for further scale-up:  
 As noted in preceding chapter, the Ministry of the Environment, Agriculture and Livestock launched 
an initiative with digital payments. The pilot allows farmers to make digital contributions to the 
state-funded chemical fertilizers scheme, reducing the distance that farmers needed to travel to 
pay in person at MFI COOPEC or the National Posts Administration, which are only located in the 
main towns of the communes. 103 To date this model has been piloted in four provinces.  
 Similar schemes, involving e-payments of fertilizers and seeds, have also been run by AuxFin, 
funded by the Belgian Development Agency  
 The Ministry of the Environment, Agriculture and Livestock has also piloted digitally enabled 
weather applications in the past.  
 The AgriCoach project is provides online training modules to some 100,000 smallholder farmers, 
as well as facilitating real-time digital information-sharing on crop management practices. The 
project has been rolled-out across Gitega, Kayanza and Karusi provinces.104 The wider program, 
called Good Agricultural Practices For All (GAP4A), is funded by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
and is being implemented by a consortium led by AUXFIN.105  
 The Swiss Development Agency has supported the partial digitization of the existing land registry.

105 Using a community-based approach, this scheme has created farmers group (consisting of no more than 50 
farmers). Farmer groups are provided with tablets and access to online training material, in exchange for a 
modest monthly subscription fee. By encouraging technology adoption among smallholder farmers, the GAP4A 
project aims to improve market conditions and access to seeds and fertilizers, as well as create more effective 
sales networks. As noted in the previous chapter, there is ample scope for scaling Agtech in Burundi, for example, 
through the development of targeted digital financial services.  
 
While digital innovation should be spearheaded by the private sector, the Government has an 
important role to play in readying the enabling environment introducing policy and incentives to 
remedy eventual market failures or inadequate information availability.  The appropriate government 
intervention will depend on the context and the agri-food systems targeted, the circumstances under 
which farmers adopt technologies, and the performance of local markets. However, as a starting point, 
government should ensure that the pre-requisite foundational elements are in place for successful 
digital transformation: 
 access to high quality connectivity;  
 access to digital devices among farmers;  
 access to other enabling rural infrastructure, including electricity, roads and logistics, and  
 capacity building of both farmers and Government staff in charge of facilitating digital 
transformation of the agricultural system  
 
Overall, actions take should be highly attuned to the risk that comes with greater digitalization, 
particularly the risk of digital exclusion of rural communities, as well as the competitive advantages 
that can result from first-mover investment and data accumulation.106 
 
Consultation with the Ministry of the Environment, Agriculture and Livestock suggested that Burundi 
still lacks many of these foundations. In particular, the Ministry notes that  many smaller initiatives 
have been piloted but failed to take-off, in part because they have proved costly to promote and 
partially because trust in related system is still weak. Consequently, the high start-up costs involved 
have prevented the launch of any further digital schemes. The Ministry stressed that a culture shift is 
still required, as given the limited familiarity and confidence in digital tools and systems, many farmers 
prefer a paper-based confirmation or receipts when making digital transactions. The private sector 
may need to spearhead related change management and improve consumer awareness to support 
on-boarding with commercial incentives, increasing the probability of sustainability. Weak phone 
penetration among farmers in another key constraint.

Private sector innovation and application of digital technologies play an instrumental role in fueling 
productivity gains, supporting service development and opening up new markets, which can accelerate 
inclusive economic growth. There is a high correlation between entrepreneurship and income-level. 
The ten top-ranking countries of the Global Innovation Index all share the characteristic of high GDP.107 
Entrepreneurship has the potential to create new businesses and jobs, generating wealth and 
improving standards of living.  Digital entrepreneurs can innovate in many sectors ranging from 
financial services, renewable energy, education, agriculture and health. The solutions proposed by 
startups make it possible to respond to specific problems by leveraging digital technology, in a way 
that is adapted to the local context.  As noted in the In-Focus Section 1, there are important 
opportunities around female entrepreneurship, based on a high female labor participation rate which 
indicates that many women are interested in economic opportunities. 
 
The PND2018-2027 prioritizes agricultural development yet fails to recognize the cross-cutting 
importance of digital entrepreneurship .108 While it does not include specific propositions for digital 
entrepreneurship, it does emphasize the importance of structural institutional reforms to support 
entrepreneurs in the agricultural sector. Digital entrepreneurs can support economic development by 
creating digital platforms and solutions that target farmers and agriculture sector – be it via market 
exchange platforms for farmers and buyers, which provide real-time market prices for agricultural

Burundi’s economy is still recovering.  The country is still reeling from years of civil war. The 2015 
political crisis and the turbulence that followed triggered negative growth figures for the first time in a 
decade. Severe economic sanctions imposed and withdrawal of donor funding had a detrimental 
impact on the economy – leading to weak foreign currency reserves and a budgetary deficit unable to 
sustain critical public investments. After a decade of steady (4.2 percent cumulative average) growth, 
from 2004 until 2014, Burundi went through two consecutive years of recession in 2015 (-3.9 percent) 
and 2016 (-0.6 percent), where the local economy contracted. Today, Burundi’s economy is slowly 
recovering, with growth recorded 
in 2017 and 2018 at a modest 0.5 
and 1.6 percent, respectively.109 
 
However, prior to the 2015 
political crisis, Burundi was a top 
business reformer – as 
demonstrated by consistent 
improvements in its Doing 
Business (DB) rankings. Burundi 
ranked among the economies that 
had improved its DB ranking the 
most for three consecutive years, 
between 2011 and 2013. Despite 
these impressive achievements, 
the 2015 crisis reversed many of 
the advances that had been made. 
Today, Burundi ranks 166th out of 
190 countries in the WB Doing 
Business survey, scoring 46.8 out of 100 (behind the SSA average, at 51.8) due to factors such as 
weak access to capital and electricity.  
 
According to 2019 WEF Global Competitiveness Index (GCI), where Burundi ranks 135th out of 141, 
political instability and corruption emerge as major deterrents for investors.  Lack of adequate 
resources, unstable political environment, and insufficient incentives to retain and attract top talent 
are the key barriers hindering Burundi from attracting and retaining its top talent. For digital 
entrepreneurship to flourish in Burundi, the issues mentioned above are fundamental and must be 
addressed to ensure sustainable development of the sector.  
 
Weak access to foreign currency reserves continues to impact Burundi’s investment prospects. 
Foreign exchange pressures have had a negative impact on imports, which has prompted the BRB 
(central bank) to impose restrictions on the transfer of foreign currency abroad. These provisions have 
adversely affected the operations of numerous digital service providers, including telecom companies 
and digital financial services providers (as noted in the previous Chapter) that require foreign currency 
to pay back debtors, dividends, expatriate staff salaries, as well as acquire key supply chain 
components including essential equipment and machinery.

Note: Given the small size of Burundi’s manufacturing industry, 
figures pertaining to the uptake of digital tools in this sector are 
unlikely to reflect wider digital adoption by traditional industry, which 
is dominated by agriculture. Moreover, figures recorded prior to 
2015 crisis ar e unlikely to reflect today’s reality.  Figure 7.1 illustrates the slow growth of Burundi’s imports of ICT goods, a key input for digitally enabled 
businesses, compared to countries such as Rwanda or the Republic of Congo (RoC).  Assuming that 
most ICT goods are imported, it can be interpreted as a proxy for the consumption of ICT goods. In 
other words, this is a strong indication that Burundi is underequipped with ICT goods, which constitutes 
a major barrier to the development and adoption of digital solutions. Burundi is on a similar trend as 
CAR, and the gap with regional peers like Rwanda and RoC has increased over the past decade. 
 
 
Meanwhile, Burundi’s innovation ecosystem is still in its infancy. Only a handful of digital 
entrepreneurs exist and many struggle to scale. Pockets of digital innovation are emerging, particularly 
around Burundi’s tech incubator – BujaHub. Notable digital startups include PayWay (a payments 
platform aggregator – see Chapter 6), E-Soko (an online e-commerce market platform), and Nova taxi 
(a ride-hailing application). However, the national innovation system still lacks significant support 
structures to enable digital entrepreneurs to flourish, including access early stage financing and 
acceleration services available in more mature innovation ecosystems. The lack of accelerators, 
growth capital, and support structure has led to the demise of most startups. Moreover, structural 
barriers and high input costs present a major challenge for fledgling digital entrepreneurs.  
 
The overall usage of digital in traditional sectors remains remarkedly low. The main sectors utilizing 
digital technology are financial services, which consists almost exclusively of mobile money services 
(as noted in the preceding Chapter). As noted above, the WEF GCI ranked Burundi at the bottom of the 
list (135 out of 141).110 The market reality acts as a strong disincentive for traditional sectors to invest 
in digital technologies. Currently, the adoption of digital tools and systems in the agriculture sector is 
low, but there is ample room for growth if the right foundations and incentives are in place, as 
discussed in the AgTech In Focus section. Stakeholder consultations suggest that few MSMEs are 
leveraging technology to support their business. This is partially due to costs incurred, but also due to 
poor digital literacy.  This not only limits the opportunity for related productive gains but also prospects 
for developing Business-to-Business (B2B) digital solutions.

This section analyses the primary drivers of digital entrepreneurship, based on the Babson 
Entrepreneurship Ecosystem Project. 
 
 
 
 
The regulatory and legal framework for digital is almost non-existent and provides few incentives for 
digital entrepreneurs. Stakeholders suggest that laws are either too rigid or missing completely.  As 
noted in earlier chapters, there is a regulatory vacuum in relation to e-transactions, data and online 
consumer protection that also thwarts private sector development in the digital space. There is also a 
legal vacuum in relation to emerging technology such as AI, drones and internet of things (IoT), as well 
as weak support for intellectual property (IP) protection that is likely to adversely impact digital 
innovators moving forward. A growing inclination toward market concentration in the telecoms sector, 
exemplified by the case of BBS and International Telecom Services, suggests that there is inadequate 
regulatory capacity in relations to managing competition issues.  
 
Moreover, many stakeholders also point to a prohibitive tax regime , which squeezes the already slim 
profit margins generated, based on the ratio of high input costs and small consumer base served 
(issues discussed further below). This certainly applies to the telecoms sector. Moreover, there appear 
to be no tax incentives in place for local or foreign investors in technology. For digital businesses, 
robust revenue collection is likely to be a prerequisite for implementing tax incentives.   
 
 
As noted above, there is also no dedicated strategy for supporting digital innovation. Nor is there 
adequate funding for related research and development (R&D), or policies conducive to private sector 
innovation and digital adoption. Moreover, there is currently weak public-private dialogue that could 
facilitate the introduction of laws, regulation and government policies more conducive to digital start-
ups. A lack of digital literacy and weak comprehension of the digital ecosystem among policy makers 
is partially to blame. While the nascent tech ecosystem appears to be working with the ICT Regulator 
(ARCT), in trying to influence positive policy change, there is room for expanding dialogue through a 
more formal and inclusive channels/fora. For example, there appears to be untapped potential for 
creating entry points for private sector innovation, under pending e-government initiatives. Open APIs 
and conducive procurement policies could be one way for Government to support the local digital 
innovation ecosystem. Other areas that Government needs to work on include boosting investor 
protection, insolvency provisions and contract enforcement, based on the latest DB assessment of 
Burundi (see Figure 7.3). Other opportunities, such as exploring export markets in areas such as 
Business Process Outsourcing (BPO), should also be explored. However this again requires a sizable, 
digitally advanced workforce which does not exist at present, as is detailed in Chapter 4. 
 
 
 
 
Weak access to affordable and quality broadband, as well as other enabling infrastructure pushes up 
costs for start-ups and deters investment in digital. As noted in Chapter 3, poor last-mile access and 
high relative prices for broadband continue to be prohibitive for the average consumer, including start-
ups. Low electricity access adds to this challenge. Notably, Burundi ranked 184th out of 190 in the 
2020 DB, in reference to access to electricity. The missing transport and logistics infrastructure are 
discussed in Section 5.2.6.  
 
A few incubators exist in Burundi, but BujaHub emerges as the only functional innovation hub 
dedicated to tech-based innovation and digital entrepreneurship.  It is privately run and receives no 
support from the government and thus has minimal financial resources. However, it has been able to 
run a handful of successful and impressive initiatives (see Box 14)111. Nevertheless, there is room to 
improve and expand the quality of existing incubation services, as well as the number of co-working 
spaces available. The Burundi Business Incubator (BBI) appears to focus predominately on traditional 
brick-and-mortar businesses.112 Meanwhile, stakeholder suggest that the franchise Impact Hub is 
present in Burundi but is under-performing and dormant.113 A new initiative, called Nawe Nuze (or 
Solidarity Groups), has also been launched with the help of development partners such as CARE and

112 See: https://www.bbin.bi/ 
113 See: https://bujumbura.impacthub.net/ 
UNICEF, and has facilitated the emergence of numerous youth social enterprises.114 The absence of 
local accelerators prevents many start-ups from reaching scale. Overall, Burundi is home to far fewer 
ecosystem support originations (ESOs) than its regional neighbors (See Annex 4).  
  
Since 2018, INGOTech hosts Burundi’s largest annual event in the digital entrepreneurship space – 
the ‘African Digital Entrepreneurship Summit’. This event  brings together private and public 
stakeholders and reputable international tech firms like Google, IBM and Facebook. This has recently 
sparked a new partnership between Facebook and INGOTech that aims to increase digital skills in 
Burundi, using Facebook Developer Coders Circles. Google has also partnered with INGOTech to 
launch the ‘Digital Skills for Africa’ program in Burundi, which aims to equip some 18,000+ young 
people with digital skills across Burundi, DRC, Tanzania and Uganda. 
 
 
 
While a handful of industry associations exist, none of them focus on the tech sector per se. These 
networks could play a larger role in supporting accelerated digital adoption. Examples include the ABEF 
and RIM in the financial sector, and farmer cooperatives in the agricultural sector.  
 
 
Most access to finance in Burundi is facilitated through loans at traditional banks, yet bank market 
penetration remains very low.  Burundi ranked 176 out of 190 countries for access to credit in the 
2020 DB report.115 While access to finance is weak in traditional sectors, it is even more limited in the 
digital sector. Virtually all digital entrepreneurs interviewed were either self-financed or had help from 
family and friends, reflecting gaps in existing credit infrastructure (noted in the preceding chapter). 
Most raised concerns that commercial banks are unwilling to lend to digital start-ups, as they are 
perceived as too risky. Stakeholder interviews also suggested that banks do not fully appreciate

115 World Bank (2020). Doing Business report. BujaHub is a private non-profit organization , created as a result of a partnership between the Young 
African Development Foundation, the Save African Youth Campaign, and Université Polytechnique 
Intégrée de Cibitoke – all operating in Burundi and focusing on supporting the education and socio-
economic development of young men and women in Africa. 
 
BujaHub provides incubation services to digital startups,  accompanying entrepreneurs in 
developing a myriad of online platforms, spanning various economic sectors (such as agriculture, 
commerce, health, transport and education). However, in the absence of a local accelerator the 
organization has also tried to fill this role, with mixed results. Many of Burundi’s existing online 
platforms are graduates of BujaHub. As of 2018, 15 start-ups had graduated from BujaHub, 
including Tanganyika Lake Tours (tourism sector), e-health application Abacu (health sector), and 
Leipa, which facilitates remittances from the diaspora (financial sector). Some five e-commerce 
platforms have also graduated, including esoko.bi and Wasili. As discussed in Chapter 4, BujaHub 
also plays an active role in supporting basic and more advanced digital skills training.  
 
BujaHub also provides support for the digitalization of traditional industries . The Hub runs 
bootcamps, hackathons and business development workshops. Last year it launched the Bingo 
Hackathon challenge, where programmers can support the development of digital business 
solutions to real world problems faced by local firms, which are subsequently bought by the 
companies in question and developed further. Experience to date suggests that there is demand 
among larger business in Burundi, as some 15 companies currently participate in the event. 
BujaHub has also set up innovation clusters, inter alia targeting agriculture and fisheries.   digitally enabled business models, and thus unfairly assess risk. High interest rates and the absence 
of adequate collateral are other barriers.  
 
There is currently limited to no grant-schemes, venture capital firms or angel networks active in the 
country, making access to early stage funding a perpetual challenge. However, stakeholders consulted 
suggested that this may be changing, as there have been signs of growing interest in Burundian 
entrepreneurs. BujaHub indicated that they currently work with four angel investors and three 
organizations (including non-profits and social impact funds), whereas other incubators often lack 
access to investor networks. The recent success achieved by a handful of Burundi start-ups in tapping 
into grant-based financing suggests that Burundi is home to ideas worth investing in.  
 
International donors and private foundations remain the main source of financing for digital 
entrepreneurs. The Tony Elumelu Foundation, which is arguably Africa’s most competitive digital 
entrepreneurship grants program, recently awarded grants to five Burundian digital entrepreneurs.116 
Seven out of five projects pitched and obtained seed capital, featuring innovation in agriculture, 
education, health and ICT sectors.  
 
A very small digitally savvy consumer base restricts the size of the addressable market for digital 
entrepreneurs. Burundi’s market is inherently small. This issue is highlighted as a key constraint in 
Burundi’s GCI profile (see Figure 7.4). However, weak digital adoption (discussed in Chapter 3) creates 
an even smaller market for digital business to tap into, as Burundi continues to have some of the 
weakest internet adoption rates in the world. Moreover, weak purchasing power, digital  literacy and 
distrust in digital platforms contribute to weak local demand. These constraints make achieving scale 
and profitability difficult. Leveraging Burundi’s access to the wider East African market will thus be 
critical, as this will allow budding start-ups to quickly scale – the benefits from supporting movement 
toward a Single Digital Market (SDM) in East Africa are briefly presented in the next in focus section, 
following the conclusion of this chapter.

Stakeholder consultations suggested that there is an emerging culture of entrepreneurship, but the 
requisite business skills to succeed are lacking . While risk appetite has traditionally been low in 
Burundi, burgeoning youth unemployment is encouraging the emergence of new entrepreneurs, grown 
of necessity rather than a knack for business. Many of these young innovators have had limited 
exposure to developed markets. Conversely, the vast majority of successful digital entrepreneurs are 
born out of the Burundian diaspora, who have returned to invest in their country. When interviewed, 
many indicated that the entrepreneurship culture in Burundi remains conservative.  
 
The current pipeline of digital talent is discussed at length in Chapter 4. Local training available limits 
the supply of advanced digital, which mean that informal training providers such as BujaHub are 
playing a growing role in nurturing and connecting talent.  BujaHub suggests that while Bujumbura is 
actually home to thousands of talented coders, many of them lack the business skills to succeed in 
launching a viable business.  
 
According to the WEF Global Competitiveness Index, Burundi is the African country least able to hold 
on to its top talent, resulting severe brain drain. However, as noted above, the Burundi diaspora is also 
proving to be an asset. This suggested that there is scope to tap into related networks to promote and 
nurture talent, and potentially support a growing network of diaspora mentors and/or angel investors.  
 
There is only limited innovation happening in the Burundian entrepreneurship ecosystem.  Incubators 
such as BujaHub are present, but they have limited resources to attract and support entrepreneurs. 
Most of the population have had limited exposure to technology, yielding modest demand for digital 
innovation. Many entrepreneurs are diaspora trying to foster a culture of innovation in Burundi. Weak 
access to credit, and low quality of connectivity are important barriers that hamper the development 
of digitally enabled businesses. Potential entrepreneurs are left with homegrown pilot solutions, which 
often disappear rapidly from the market, or relay on donor funding. 
 
 A small group of actors is dedicated to 
improving conditions  for young Burundian 
entrepreneurs, by providing access to 
adequate technologies. These include local 
and international partners but would benefit 
from increased support from the 
Government. 
 Some startups manage to create innovative 
products, but most initiatives are very early 
stage and face difficulties to scale up  There are practically  no dedicated strateg ies, 
programs or regulations  to accompany digital 
transformation in the private sector 
 Active players lack the means and resources  
to scale up training, incubation and 
networking of digital startups 
 The low user base of electronic devices and 
digital services  discourages digital innovation 
 Overall technology adoption by traditional 
businesses is low  
 Access to financial capital is low , with digital 
entrepreneurs usually perceived as too risky 
for traditional investors  Important opportunities in the agriculture  
sector to leverage digital technology, which 
provides 90 percent of jobs 
 There are several projects from international 
partners such as UNDP, WEF, World Bank 
and the Dutch Cooperation which can be 
leveraged  Burundi has one of the least business-friendly 
environments in the world (166/190 in WB 
DB, 135/141in WEF GCI) 
 Low network coverage in rural areas , along 
with speed issues  and high cost of data  
 Low skills base in the population 
 
 
 
 
The following recommendations could support the development of digital entrepreneurship in Burundi:  
 
 
 
R1. Adopt a national digital strategy. The Government of Burundi should revise its current national 
development plan to include a holistic digital economy strategy as a key pillar to achieving its national 
development goals. About 90 percent of the Burundi population is comprised of small-scale farmers; 
the Government explore and adopt s comprehensive plan for digital technology in agriculture to 
improve the living standards of this majority group.  
 
R2. Increase financing instruments to entrepreneurs and address the financing gap. Given the lack of 
access to finance and nascency of the ecosystem, the Government of Burundi should consider 
providing tax incentives for private investors in local startups. Additionally, given the 
underrepresentation of women in the sector, the government should promote the investment in 
women digital entrepreneurs.  
 
R3. Improve key infrastructure constraints. As noted in Chapter 3,  only 2.7 percent of Burundi’s 
population have access to internet, and only 9 percent have access to electricity. The World Bank 
recently approved a $160 million grant to Burundi to improve access to electricity in rural areas; the 
government should leverage this opportunity in developing its digital development plan, as well as 
seeking out other investment opportunities in energy.  
 
R4. Increase entrepreneurial capacity by investing in ecosystem and education institutions. The 
government needs to support innovation hubs, with technical assistance and financing, emphasing 
early stage financing and mentorship. Addressing the significant gap in digital skills and ICT adoption 
is crucial; by introducing digital entrepreneurship training into the national education curriculum, and 
promoting and advertising success stories, the government could incentivize more youth to pursue 
entrepreneurial ventures, particularly in in high-productivity sectors  
 
 
R5. Level the playing field for smaller and new market entrants. The government should not pick sides 
and offer unfair advantages to select companies. Such practices worsen the business environment 
and increase the risk portfolio, disincentivizing entrepreneurs and investors to invest into the market. 
Given its historic political instability, Burundi is already perceived as a high-risk country for investment, 
thus any additional market risks such as anti-competitive regulatory policies will further discourage 
private companies to invest in the digital entrepreneurship sector.  
  
R6. Create a public-private sector dialogue platform. It will be paramount to engage with all relevant 
stakeholders before adopting or implementing key policies. The Government should identify and 
engage these stakeholders using a formal platform for dialogue that includes private sector digital 
players, startup representatives, relevant line ministries, development partners, as well as relevant 
civil society organizations. Such a holistic approach will lead to more informed decision making and 
policy related to digital entrepreneurship.  
 
R7. Identify and partner up with local digital champions. Burundi has had limited number of successful 
digital entrepreneurs. Thus far, most of these entrepreneurs have received no support from the 
government. The Government of Burundi should first identify these champions, and then work to 
provide support and incentives for them to flourish. 
 
R8. Increase market integration with regional actors and outreach to Burundian diaspora.  Given the 
small size of the domestic market, attracting regional players to Burundi could increase access to 
business opportunities, financing and mentorship for Burundian entrepreneurs. There is scope to build 
on the Burundi diaspora to support potential champions and start nurturing networks of business 
angels. Opportunities within the East African Single Digital Market are further explored in the In-Focus 
Section 3 below. A Single Digital Market (SDM) in East African could allow the region to become a more deeply 
integrated and dynamic digital investment, innovation and trade hub. Many countries in the region are 
too small to succeed in the digital economy in isolation. They need economies of scale and the network 
effects offered by a larger regional market to help bridge the digital divide faster both within their 
respective countries and the region. An SDM could accelerate the growth of technology-enabled 
businesses, lower the cost of key telecom services, and catalyze new digital services for citizens and 
businesses alike. It could help tackle many of the key constraints that East African countries face 
today, including the small size of domestic markets and dependence on coastal neighbors to carry 
internet connectivity. Despite the integration efforts in the region, and Burundi’s intention to 
participate in an SDM, the country has not yet made gains in this area.  
 
Given its small market size, Burundi will need to be at the forefront of efforts to create a larger, more 
integrated digital market in East Africa and beyond . Creating a larger regional market will help 
decrease the costs of digital services for local consumers and create room for Burundian digitally 
enabled firms to quickly scale. An integrated East African digital market would be the ninth largest in 
the world, based on population, creating the ‘domestic’ market size needed to attract digital 
investment and provide a larger and more familiar space for local firms to grow before having to 
compete in global markets. It will provide the region with the heft to compete against digital giants on 
the continent such as Nigeria, and ultimately to contend with the globally dominant digital hubs. 
Research undertaken suggests that implementing an SDM in East Africa would create an additional 
US$1 to US$2.6 billion boost in GDP and between 1.6 to 4.5 million new jobs across the region. 
 
An SDM for East Africa is defined as one in which cross-border barriers to providing and accessing 
digital infrastructure, content, and services are eliminated . A seamless and competitive regional digital 
ecosystem would drive a reinforcing cycle of economic growth, investment, innovation, job creation, 
and improved service delivery. Achieving an SDM will require simultaneously supporting domestic 
development, and cross-border integration of the following submarket structures, which form distinct 
yet interconnected layers of the overall SDM. These include the following: 
 A single connectivity market , removing barriers to regional telecom infrastructure and services 
deployment to encourage investment, improve performance, eliminate pricing and quality 
differentials between coastal and landlocked countries while simultaneously expanding 
connectivity access to all.  
 A single data market , enabling secure exchange, storage, and processing of data across borders; 
support regional deployment of data infrastructure; and drive supply and demand for data-driven 
services and innovation across the region. 
 A single online market , allowing firms, governments, and citizens to access and deliver both public 
and private services online; undertake e-commerce transactions; and access digital content and 
information seamlessly from anywhere in the region. 
 
 
 
 
The Government of Burundi has set itself ambitious development objectives, identifying digital 
technology as a central pillar in transforming its economy and reducing poverty.  While the country has 
made progress in expanding access to digital infrastructure and enabling growth in DFS, much remains 
to be done in order to bring about an innovation ecosystem that translates into growth and job creation. 
The nascent stage of Burundi’s digital economy is reflected in low rates of digital adoption, a significant 
rural-urban digital divide and a lack of an overarching and cohesive digital strategy.  
 
  
 
Increasing digital adoption and usage must be a priority for the Government – ensuring that no one is 
left behind. On the supply side, investment in Burundi’s middle mile has created a solid base to build 
on, but gaps in last-mile access still prevent rural communities from coming online. Moving forward, 
emphasis needs to be placed on expanding last-mile access. Low demand also limits market 
development, meaning that interventions that help stimulate the growing demand are needed. This is 
likely to require a multi-pronged approach that tackles both the affordability and skills barriers etc. 
However, a concerted effort on regulation is also needed to ensure the local broadband market is far 
more competitive than today– this will require removing key bottlenecks such as existing gateways 
and competition issues in key market segments – in favor of affordable, accessible and quality 
broadband services.  
 
Burundi’s youth bulge  needs to be equipped with the right skills to get online.  More needs to be done 
to embed digital skills in the formal education system in Burundi. While this may take time, 
Government should start by incrementally putting the requisite enablers in place – creating a clear 
skills framework, curriculum, training teachers and boosting access to needed infrastructure and 
devices. There is also scope to expand and improve existing IT courses available at TVET and HEIs. In 
tandem, innovative approaches should be used to expand opportunities for digital skills training, by 
crowding in industry players, private sector providers, and development partners.  
 
 
The digital sector is yet to support the transformation of traditional sectors, given weak digital adoption 
by government and the agricultural sector. Poor digital adoption by consumers and key sectors, such 
as agriculture, means that digital technology is yet to have a transformational impact on Burundi’s 
economy. Moving forward, digital skills and ICT-driven innovation will be instrumental in supporting 
productivity gains across both primary and non-primary sectors and creating off-farm jobs in Burundi. 
Figure 8.1 summarizes Burundi’s envisaged transition to a digital economy.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
To date, most progress has been made under the pillars of digital infrastructure and digital financial 
services. While there is still work required to enhance these pillars further and consolidate progress 
made to date, increasing attention also needs to be paid to the other key elements of the digital 
economy ecosystem. For example, Government still lacks many of the foundational elements needed 
to scale up its e-government capability, including shared infrastructure, services and growing technical 
capacity. Increasing government’s use of digital could, in turn, help fuel infrastructure expansion by 
creating an anchor tenant and predicable demand for digital services. A Government push to digitize 
Burundi’s agricultural sector could create growing entry points and opportunities for digital 
entrepreneurs in Agtech, fueling the expansion of e-commerce and fintech.
