sure statement(s).Adopting Mobile Money:  
Evidence from an Experiment in Rural Africa †
By Catia Batista and Pedro C. Vicente*
Mobile money creates the opportunity for 
individuals with basic cell phones in poor areas 
underserved by formal financial services to 
save money and receive  long-distance transfers 
instantly, safely, and inexpensively.
Mozambique is a country with extremely 
limited financial inclusion even by  sub-Saharan 
standards. According to  Demirgüç-Kunt et al. 
(2018), in 2017 only 10 percent of adults liv-
ing in rural areas of the country held savings in 
a formal bank account. And only 15 percent of 
migrant remittances were received via formal 
channels in these rural locations.
We conducted a randomized controlled trial 
to investigate the impact of introducing mobile 
money services for the first time in rural areas of 
southern Mozambique. In this paper we describe 
the mobile money adoption patterns following 
this intervention. Batista and Vicente (2013) 
describes the randomized introduction of mobile 
money in detail, whereas Batista and Vicente 
(2018) examines its broader economic impact 
using the randomized controlled trial.
This article describes the individual charac-
teristics of early and late adopters and examines 
their mobile money usage patterns. We use a 
combination of administrative and household survey data to characterize the adoption of 
mobile money services in the three years follow-
ing their initial introduction.
A large proportion of the sampled individ-
uals who were offered mobile money services 
adopted this technology. These adopters of 
mobile money (and early adopters in particular) 
are likely to be more educated than  nonadopters, 
and they are also more likely to already hold a 
bank account. These findings are in line with 
Suri (2011) in that education and financial 
inclusion are both associated with lower costs 
of using mobile money technology. Education 
in particular is also possibly linked with higher 
potential benefits of mobile money—especially 
when this technology is used to receive remit-
tances from migrants who also tend to be posi-
tively selected on education.
 Positive self-selection into mobile money 
usage raises the question of whether mobile 
money is an effective tool for financial inclu-
sion. Indeed, if those who adopt mobile money 
first and keep using this technology over time 
are disproportionately those who already had 
bank accounts, this is an effective tool for finan-
cial deepening—and new approaches to promote 
financial inclusion must be devised together 
with strategies for organic technology adoption 
following its initial dissemination.
I. Sampling and Data
Our work builds on a large randomized con-
trolled trial by Batista and Vicente (2018). This 
project evaluated the broad economic impact 
of randomly introducing mobile money ser -
vices for the first time in rural areas of southern 
Mozambique.
As described in detail by Batista and Vicente 
(2013), mobile money was introduced in 51 
enumeration areas (EAs) that were followed 
over time using household surveys and admin-
istrative data. The baseline household survey, VOL. 110595
ADOPTING MOBILE MONEY: EVIDENCE FROM AN EXPERIMENT IN RURAL AFRICA
performed before mobile money was made 
available, provides us with the baseline charac-
teristics of all the individuals who were offered 
the mobile money technology in the treated 
areas. The administrative data on mobile money 
usage were provided by Carteira Movel, the 
operator of the mKesh mobile money brand in 
Mozambique. These data allow us to character -
ize the mobile money transactions performed by 
adopters of the service between July 2012 and 
June 2015.
II. Who Are the Adopters?
The measured adoption rate for mobile money 
in this project was large: 87 percent of the indi-
viduals offered mobile money services made at 
least one transaction over the  three-year period 
for which we have administrative records. As 
shown in Table 1, 36 percent of our sample are 
early adopters who start using the service from 
its inception and keep on doing so in the follow-
ing 3 years—they perform at least 1 transac-
tion in each of the 3 years included in our data. 
Experimenters, who conduct at least one trans-
action in the first year and stop making trans-
actions afterward, are 18 percent of the sample, 
whereas late adopters, who only start using 
mobile money in the second or third year after 
it was made available, correspond to 6 percent.
Table 1 shows the characteristics of adopters 
in our sample. Adopters of mobile money are 
positively  self-selected. They are significantly 
more educated than  nonadopters and also sig-
nificantly more likely to have a bank account of 
their own, have a job, and be wage earners. This 
positive  self-selection pattern is reinforced for 
early adopters: these early and continued adopt-
ers of mobile money have an average additional 
year of schooling (relative to  non-early adopt-
ers), and they are 13 percentage points more 
likely to hold their own bank account. Early 
adopters are also more likely to have jobs and be 
wage earners than average adopters.
Experimenters who adopted the service early 
on and afterward stopped using it are not pos-
itively selected from the full sample. They are 
marginally less likely to own a bank account and 
more likely to have a car—which may enable 
them to travel to nearby urban areas and make 
use of formal financial services (e.g., to send 
remittances) at a lower cost than other resi-
dents in rural areas. Late adopters cannot be  statistically distinguished from other individuals 
in the full sample.
Interestingly, unlike prior work on mobile 
phone and mobile money technology adop-
tion, such as Aker and Mbiti (2010) or Jack and 
Suri (2011), respectively, we do not find any 
evidence that adopters are statistically differ -
ent from  nonadopters in terms of age, gender, 
or expenditure profile. This may be because 
our intervention targeted all household heads. 
For this reason, it is not skewed by individu-
als  self-selecting to be registered in the mobile 
money system.
III. What Do Adopters Do?
In order to understand the incidence and aver -
age value of each type of transaction made by 
the different types of mobile money adopters, 
we estimate the following regression:
(1)   Y il   = α  + β 1    EarlyAdopter il   
 +  β 2    Experimenter il
   +  β 3    LateAdopter il   + γ  X i   +  θ l   +  ε il,    
where   Y il    is the outcome variable of interest for 
household i in location l,   EarlyAdopter il    equals 
one if individual i has a recorded transaction 
in all three years in the administrative data-
set,   Experimenter il    equals one if individual i 
has a recorded transaction in the first year after 
mobile money is introduced but not in any of 
the subsequent years,   LateAdopter il    equals one 
if individual i does not have a recorded transac-
tion in the first year after mobile money is intro-
duced but has recorded transactions in any of the 
later years,   X i    is a vector of individual controls 
including demographics and financial indica-
tors, and   θ l    is a vector of location fixed effects.
Table 2 describes the predictors of each type 
of mobile money transaction being performed. 
As could be expected, early adopters are more 
likely to perform all transactions, but they are 
especially prone to receive and send transfers as 
well as purchase airtime. Experimenters, in con-
trast, are more likely to purchase airtime and less 
likely to receive transfers. Late adopters tend to 
receive and send fewer transfers than all other 
mobile money adopters in the sample—this is 
consistent with their lack of initial adoption, 
unlike early adopters, who base their continued MAY 2020596

adoption on transfers, and experimenters, who 
may have access to alternative ways of receiving 
transfers.
Table  3 shows that the average value per 
mobile money transaction is again higher for all 
transactions performed by early adopters  relative 
to all other mobile money adopters in the sam-
ple. These average values are particularly higher for transfers received and  cash-outs—a pattern 
consistent with individuals who often receive 
transfers from migrants in urban areas and in 
line with the results discussed in Batista and 
Vicente (2018). On the contrary, experimenters 
tend to have lower average values of  cash-outs 
and transfers received, whereas late adopters 
display lower average values of transfers sent.Table 1—Descriptive Statistics

Notes: “ Nonadopters” do not have any transaction recorded in the administrative data. “Early adopters” are defined as hav-
ing performed at least one mobile money transaction in each of the three years covered by data. “Experimenters” are defined 
as having performed at least one mobile money transaction in the first year after its introduction but not in subsequent years. 
“Late adopters” are defined as having performed at least one mobile money transaction in the second or third years after its 
availability but not in the first year after the service was introduced. Statistical significance is assessed on the estimated differ -
ence between mean utilization rates of adopters and  nonadopters in the full sample, for each definition of adopter. Estimated 
difference is not shown. The US dollar to Mozambican metical exchange rate varied between 28 and 38 over the three- year 
period included in our sample. VOL. 110597
ADOPTING MOBILE MONEY: EVIDENCE FROM AN EXPERIMENT IN RURAL AFRICA
IV . Concluding Remarks
Our analysis shows that adoption of mobile 
money tends to be positively  self-selected. 
Early adopters in rural areas who continuously 
use the technology ( and receive most remote 
transfers)  are better educated and often already 
own a bank account. Further spreading the 
financial inclusion benefits of mobile money 
requires designing technology dissemination 
strategies that go beyond the financial literacy, free experimentation, and  in-person support 
provided by the experimental intervention we  
implemented.
