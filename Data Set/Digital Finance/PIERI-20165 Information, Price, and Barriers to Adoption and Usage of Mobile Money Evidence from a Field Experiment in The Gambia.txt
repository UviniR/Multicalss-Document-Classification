Abstract
This is a draft nal project report on price subsidy and digital pay-
ments system in Gambia. Underutilization of nancial products due
to transaction cost or lack of information is an issue of huge policy
relevance in developing countries. In this project, we used a eld
experiment to study whether subsidizing the prices of withdrawals
charges of an mobile wallet combined with monthly reminders can
encourage inactive wallet users to make more use of their wallets.
The preliminary results indicate that this intervention increases just
mildly the active use of a mobile money wallets. Interestingly, we
also nd that higher price subsidies do not motivate more usage than
lower price subsidies, thus, implying the increase in information is the
foci means via which the intervention catalyses usage.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Motivation and Context of the Study
Mobile money banking as a tool for nancial inclusion is increasingly becoming
popular in the developing world, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Due to easy
access to mobile phones than bank branches by the poor and low transaction
cost, mobile money (or digital nance in general) is heralded as a sound tool
that can substantially increase access to nancial services by the poor (Kendall
and Voorhies, 2014). Initially, it used to be popular only in East African coun-
tries such as Kenya where the revolution started with M-pesa, but now it is also
becoming ubiquitous in Western Africa. Due to low access to nancial services
and high access to mobile phones, oering of nancial services via mobile phones
is heralded as an important tool that can revolutionize nancial services adop-
tion and usage in developing countries thereby fostering rapid nancial inclusion.
However, despite becoming rampant in many developing countries, the role of
mobile money in revolutionizing formal nancial account access and usage has so
far been modest (Demirg u c-Kunt et al., 2017)
Due to low levels of nancial inclusion in Gambia and the huge poverty levels
in the country, mobile money banking is seen as a potential game changer in terms
of stimulating nancial inclusion and consequently catalyzing economic growth
and development in the country. For instance, while the banking penetration
rate is about 25% (Jaabi, 2017), the mobile phone penetration rate is about 67%
(GSM, 2017), which is among the highest in Western Africa. This indicates that
oering nancial services via mobile technology oers an opportunity for broader
nancial inclusion in Gambia. In line with this, the rst mobile money service
was launched in 2016 by Qcell - one of the largest GSM operators in the country.
2But despite its promise, the revolutionary potentials of mobile money could
be limited by high marginal cost such as high cash-out or transaction fees usually
associated with service. In the case of Gambia's biggest mobile money provider,
QMoney, the cash-out fees currently charge are on average higher than what
similar providers like Mpesa charges for withdrawals fees. These high cash-out
fees could be a reason why the gains of mobile money in terms of revolutionizing
nancial access in Gambia have been modest. Moreover, evidence (See Karlan
et al., 2014), has shown that high monetary cost has the potential to deter the
poor from using nancial services. In this regard, it is important to understand
how responsive to price of cash-outs demand and use of mobile money is. This has
important policy implication as it will highlight whether subsidizing withdrawal
fees could be a viable tool to increase nancial service access and use in Gambia
via mobile money.
Therefore, in this project, we study whether subsidizing cash out fees could
stimulate more usage of mobile money services. In other words, we study the
responsiveness of usage of mobile money services to changes in price of cash-out
fees. To this eect, we use a randomized eld experiment where we randomly vary
the cost of cash-out charges among some randomly selected clients of QMoney,
a private mobile money provider. The clients are randomly assigned to one of
three dierent withdrawals fees discount: 0% , 15% and 30%. We then study
how the adoption of the new oer and usage of mobile money accounts varies
across dierent withdrawal or cash-out fees subsidies. Thus, by experimentally
varying one element of transaction fee (cash-out fees) we can determine how
this is relevant for usage rates. The preliminary evidence we nd is that price
subsidies mildly increase in the usage of mobile wallets. In addition, we also nd
that higher price subsidies do not increase usage more than lower price subsidies.
Given that our intervention also included calling the wallets in the treatment
sample to remind them that their discounts are still active, implies that the
mechanism through which the intervention aects usage is via information and
not primary. However, since the intervention is still ongoing, the results must be
interpreted with care.
31.2 Research Questions and Objectives
The primary objective of our study is to provide rigorous evidence on the use
of digital payment systems and how they can be improved. Given our research
objectives, we ask the following questions:
1. What is the impact of withdrawal fee discounts on usage of e-money ac-
counts? Given that high monetary cost such as high cash-out fees can be
a limitation to mobile money usage; it's important to examine whether the
use of mobile money changes due to reduction in monetary cost.
2. What is the elasticity of mobile money usage to changes in price of cash-
outs? The impact of cash-out pricing on demand and usage will depend
on the elasticity of demand and usage. Thus, knowing the nature of the
elasticity of mobile money account usage to variation in price of cash-outs
will help to uncover the specic roles cash out fees play in the usage of
mobile money accounts.
3. Third, Is the reduction in transaction cost a useful tool to promote digital
nance access and usage in The Gambia?
2 MOTIVATION AND PRECEDENTS
2.1 Price vs Infromation - Is Mobile Money Too Expen-
sive or Are Potential Users Misinformed?
In this experiment, we create exogenous variation in withdrawal fees to identify
the eect of withdrawal subsidies on usage of mobile money services. Mobile
money being a means of oering nancial services at lower transaction cost than
standard nancial products like basic savings account (e.g. do not require any
minimum balance and users can save on transportation cost), it is an attractive
nancial product for the poor. However, high withdrawal charges can inhibit its
usage. Therefore, it is not far-fetched that high marginal cost such as withdrawal
charges can be a constraint for using mobile money services; more so for the poor,
who are usually the target of providers of such services.
Therefore, when withdrawal fees constraints are binding in that they aect
the optimal choices of an individual in the decision to use mobile money ser-
4vices, then, the expectation is that the easing of such a constraint via subsidies
should motivate more mobile money account usage. That is we should expect
to see a positive responsiveness of mobile account usage to a positive change in
withdrawal fees. In other words, the elasticity parameter we are after should be
greater than one and signicant. Having said that, it is worth highlighting that
even though our hypothesis that the elasticity parameter of interest should be
elastic is reasonable, it is nonetheless possible to still get zero elasticity as related
studies (Such as Karlan and Zinman, 2018) have found for saving yields. This
will be the case if withdrawal fees constraints do not bind, which will mean other
features of mobile money (e.g. lack of information) rather than price are more
important inuencers of account usage or that they are more salient that they
render withdrawal fee discounts ineective.
Accordingly, the main research hypothesis of interest in this study is that
mobile money usage response to changes in price of withdrawal or cash-out fees.
Therefore, the main outcomes we expect our intervention to impact in the short
run are outcomes related to account usage such whether the wallets became active
and cash-ins and cash-outs. Other outcomes that can be indirectly impacted are
frequency of using accounts for other payments such as P2P transfers or bill
payments. Despite services such as P2P transfers come with no additional cost,
they can be made unattractive if high cash-out fees render the entire product
unattractive. For this reason, these variables can also be impacted by a change
in cash-out charges.
2.2 Literature Review
Given that pricing and design are paramount for the success of any privately
oered product, especially a product that targets the poor in developing countries,
there has recently been a growing interest to understand the responsiveness to
price and design of various products usage or demand by the poor. For instance,
in the context of health-related products like bednets and chlorine, studies on
demand or usage responsiveness to price or \cost sharing" were carried out by
Cohen et al. (2010) in Kenya and Ashraf et al. (2010) in Zambia; respectively. As
among the rst eld experimental studies on this topic, these studies have been
able to provide rigorous evidence on how the pricing of these products aect their
demand and usage.
5Similarly, in the nancial inclusion literature, there has been a mounting
number of studies in recent years to understand how the pricing of nancial
products aect their demand and usage. This started with studies by Banerjee
and Duo (2006), Mills et al. (2008), and Grinstein-Weiss et al. (2013) in the
USA that looked at the impact of matching contributions on retirement saving
and individual development accounts. Recently, there has been an increasing
number of studies in developing countries context as well. Specically, studies
by Schaner (2015) in Kenya, and recentlyKast et al. (2018) in Chile, and Karlan
and Zinman (2018) in the Philippines, all looked at the impact of an increase in
savings yields on demand and usage of commitment saving accounts. However,
despite studying similar nancial products, these studies nd mixed results on
elasticity to yields of saving accounts. In particular, while Schaner (2015) nds a
positive eect of saving yields on account usage by well-matched couples, Karlan
and Zinman (2018) and Kast et al. (2018) didn't nd a statistically signicant
impact of savings yield on demand and usage of savings accounts. In other words,
they nd that price elasticity of the saving accounts studied were not dierent
from zero. In fact, in the study by Karlan and Zinman (2018), which unlike in the
previous studies used \market-viable rates" in their experiment, they nd that
even the upper bound of elasticity estimates are less than 0.5. Therefore, the
emerging evidence so far on this topic is inconclusive. Hence, for better policy
recommendations, more evidence is required. Our study, even though not on
savings yields, is one of those attempts. Moreover, we contribute to the evidence
on access barriers to usage of digital payments and whether subsidies can catalyse
usage.
Particularly, our project contributes to the growing literature from two stand-
points: rst, the current evidence is focused on the elasticity of savings yields and
not much evidence on other aspects of saving such as transaction fees. Second,
almost all the evidence that exist currently is based on commitment savings prod-
ucts. Thus, no evidence exists on the elasticity of usage of digital products like
mobile money, which are now very popular in developing countries.
63 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
3.1 Context, experiment design, and escription of the in-
tervention
Our experiment targets clients of a mobile money provider in Gambia who do
not actively use their mobile money wallets. In Gambia, there are currently two
GSM operators providing mobile money services, Qcell with QMoney and Africell
with Africellmoney. But due to outreach and service reliability at the time of the
start of the study, we partner with QMoney mobile money for the experiment.
The QMoney mobile money account oers all the basic services associated with
a standard nancial account such as a basic savings account with a commercial
bank. In particular, it enable users to deposit and withdraw funds from their
account and use the account to send or receive transfers from others including
bill payments. Like any electronic wallet, the QMoney mobile money account
provides access to electronic money that is exchangeable (at a rate of one to one)
to physical money at any time. It doesn't cost anything to exchange cash into
e-money (i.e. cash-ins) but it cost something to exchange e-money into cash (be
it cash-out or bill payments). Among the fundamental features of the product
are cash-ins and cash-outs; hence, the pricing of these features should also aect
the desirability and usage of the technology. In this experiment, we focus on
cash-out charges for two reasons: rst, for QMoney users it is currently the most
expensive aspect of the product; thus, it has direct impacts on usage { our main
outcome of interest. Second, cash-outs also aect the attractiveness of the entire
product as it aects liquidity. Specically, high cash-out fees mean higher price
for liquidity and for users that care about this feature of the product it might
limit their usage of the technology. Therefore, by subsidizing withdrawal fees, we
expect the use of accounts by beneciaries to increase.
In implementing the experiment, rst, we identify inactive wallets from QMoney
mobile wallet platform; inactive clients are clients that have not used their wallet
for any transaction three months before the start of the project, i.e. between
June 1st and August 31st 2018. Second, after we identify these wallets, they are
assigned to one of three experimental arms: a control arm consisting of partici-
pants that will not receive any of withdrawal discounts and two treatment arms
where participants will receive one of two withdrawal fee discounts; a withdrawal
7fee discount of 15% or 30%. The withdrawal fees discounts will be oered for
just 6 months, which has been communicated to all clients. The randomization
of participants to each arm was done at the individual wallet level. Hence, after
the population of the inactive wallets on the QMoney platform was determined,
a random number of the wallets were selected for inclusion into the study. Then,
a calling exercise was undertaken to determine the address and willingness to
participate of the owners of the selected wallets. Upon conclusion of the calling
exercise, a list of successful calls was developed and interview of participants on
this list followed. Hence, the list of all successful interviews became the experi-
mental sample, which was used to select wallets into treatment and control groups
using STATA. Specically, 42% of participants in the experimental sample are
assigned to the control arm and the rest to treatment arms at the rate of 1/2 to
each arm.
But before the randomized assignment of participants to the dierent exper-
imental arms is implemented, a baseline survey of the eligible participants is
necessary; it allows for the collection of information on the experimental sample
that can be used to check the for balance of observed characteristics before the
intervention. In this regard, our baseline survey was meant to collect information
on the clients' socio-economic characteristics including basic information about
their nancial behaviour such as whether they own other nancial products like
credit or saving with a commercial bank and their savings habits. Additionally,
a module on hypothetical time discounting for time preferences elicitation was
included. After the completion of the baseline survey and the assignment of wal-
lets into treatment and control, owners of wallets selected to be in the treatment
group received SMS from QMoney followed by a call from the researchers inviting
them to accept the new oers received. Upon acceptance of the oer, i.e. reveal
their willingness to take up, the discounted withdrawals on their accounts are
applied immediately. The discounts are payable at the end of every month and
by QMoney.
Once the intervention is rolled-out, we plan to carry out our rst follow-up in
5 to 6 months; depending on the availability of funds, further rounds of follow-
ups could be done to assess whether the intervention aect household welfare
of participants. The rst follow-up survey will collect information on household
characteristics and their perception about the withdrawal discounts. This survey
8will complement the information on the usage of the accounts that will come
from the administrative data of QMoney. This information will allow us to make
a deeper analysis of the usage of the accounts.
Therefore, by randomly assigning eligible participants or clients to any of
these experimental groups with equal probability, we will generate an exogenous
variation in withdrawal or cash-out fees that we can use to identify how usage
response to subsidized price of withdrawals.
3.2 Randomization Units and selection of sample
We target inactive clients on Qodoo mobile money platform; inactivity is de-
termined by whether a client uses an account regularly or not. In particular,
we focus on clients that have not made in any transaction with their wallet in
the three months before our intervention. Thus, we are hypothesizing that high
transaction fees could be among the reasons for low account usage among these
clients. Therefore, by exposing them to withdrawal subsidies, we will give them
an incentive to use their accounts more often. Simple random assignment of
selected participants into control and treatment arms was done using STATA.
The required sample size was determined before the baseline survey using
power calculations and pre-intervention data on the main outcome indicators
interest for the inactive users of the Qodoo wallet. The focus was on two main
measures of outcome: (1) Average monthly cash-ins of a wallet and (2) average
monthly Net balance of a wallet. Hence, a client is regarded inactive when she has
not used her wallet for any transaction 3 months before the start of this study, i.e.
before 1st September 2018. Before the baseline, the sample size was determining
using power calculations and assuming an eect size of 0.135 on cash-ins and net
wallet balance. The power calculations done after the baseline survey indicated
that with a sample size of 1014 observations, can still detect eect sizes less than
0.20, which is acceptable.
94 DATA SOURCES
4.1 Baseline Survey
4.1.1 Baseline Survey and Start of the Intervention
4.1.2 General Description
The survey targeted registered inactive wallets on the QMoney platform. The
denition of inactivity adopted is based on the QMoney denition, which is wal-
lets not used for any transaction for three months. Therefore, in our case, the
target sample consist of all wallets that between June and August 2018 were
inactive. To select the evaluation sample from the population of such wallets
on the QMoney platform, a list of all inactive users were requested and received
from QMoney. We used this list to randomly select 2625 wallets to be in our
evaluation sample.
Given that the list of the eligible population that we received from QMoney
had information on just the number associated with a wallet and not the name
or address of the user of the wallet, it was suggested that we call the numbers
to conrm the names and addresses of the wallet holders; the explanation from
QMoney on this is that a number link to a mobile money wallet is also used as a
regular phone number by the owner. Due to high demand for numbers, a number
is recycled if it is inactive for three months. If a number is recycled, both the name
and address of the owner could be dierent from what it is in the database of the
mobile money provide; such information is usually not updated. Therefore, our
baseline survey was divided into two stages; in the rst stage, a calling exercise
was done to conrm the addresses and names of holders of the wallets in the
evaluation sample. This calling exercise started with random assignment of 154
numbers to call in 3 days to each enumerator. In the second phase, interviews
with the wallet holders reached in the rst stage were conducted.
At the end of the rst calling exercise and even after some interviews were
conducted, it came to our noticed that the list provided to us by QMoney had
wallets that were actually active wallets; this was caused by the fact that when
the initial list of inactive wallets was being prepared, some transactions were
not considered. Given that a wallet could be inactive for one transaction (e.g.
bank transfer) but active with regards to others (e.g. cash-ins), the failure to
10account for all transaction created the problem. As our study targets just inactive
wallets, we had to x t this problem before proceeding with the data collection.
Therefore, to eliminate the active number in the list, we did the following : rst,
we requested for data on all transaction from QMoney and identied wallets that
were, in terms of cash-ins or cash-outs, inactive. Second, we merged the list
from step one with the list of active wallets for all the other transactions (i.e.
bank to wallet transfer, bill payment, buying airtime, P2P transfer). Finally,
when a wallet is found to be inactive for cash-ins and cash-outs but active for
the other transactions, the wallet is eliminated from the initial list. Through this
algorithm, about 900 wallets in the initial list were found to be active, which
were discarded from the rst list. Finally, about 8000 numbers were randomly
selected from the new list.1Due to these changes, the list of wallet holders to
be contacted by each enumerator changed from 154 to about 572 wallets. The
contacting of wallets in the new list lasted for three days and the enumerators
were able to successfully reach a signicant number of wallet holders for interview.
Before the interviews, successfully contacted wallet holders were sorted according
to region, and assignment of wallets to enumerators for interview was done based
on proximity, i.e. each enumerator was given a list of wallet holders in the same
area; this was done to ensure that the enumerators do not have to travel back and
forth to the same area. After the assignment of questionnaires to the enumerators
was completed, interviews started the next day.
Aside the challenge discussed in the preceding paragraph, two other challenges
faced were: (i) a lot of users identied in the rst stage as registered clients and
interested in participating in the study, were found to be actually unregistered
and (ii) some of interviewees that have initially shown interest in the study later
became not interested. Due to these latter challenges, we had to extend the
duration of the data collection exercise; this helped us to make more successful
interviews. Notwithstanding the successful address of the challenges, it was still
dicult to reach our target sample size of 2625 wallets. But as we argue in section
5.1.1, these shortcomings will not have a signicant impact on the study in terms
of power. Therefore, overall, the data collection can be regarded as successful
1the expansion of the second list beyond our target sample is motivated by the experience from
the previous calling exercise that a lot of the holders of the wallets in the initial list consist
were not reachable. Therefore, by expanding the list, we are able to easily replace wallets the
new list when they are not reachable.
11as the number of successful interviews made was substantial and we had a very
good response rate.
4.1.3 Geographical Coverage and Enumerators Selection and Distri-
bution
Since QMoney services are available nationwide and respondents were selected via
a random sample from the population of inactive wallets on the QMoney platform,
the survey was nationwide. However, the holders of most of the selected wallets
(about 50 percent) are residence of the urban areas of The Gambia (i.e. The
Greater Banjul area- Banjul, Kaning Municipal Council and some part of West
Coast region) and the other 50 percent are residence of the rural areas of The
Gambia (i.e. North Bank Region, Central River Region, Lower River Region and
Upper River Region, and some part of West Coast Region).
For the baseline survey, initially, 17 enumerators and 4 supervisors were
trained and used. However, after the rst calling exercise, about 3 enumerators
drop-out, thus, leaving us with 14 enumerators. The 14 enumerators were tasked
to administer all the interviews. As the survey is nationwide, all ve regions of
the country (WCR, LRR, NBR, CRR, and URR) plus the two municipalities
(KMC and BJL) were covered. The number of enumerators sent to a region or
municipality depended on the number of QMoney inactive wallet holders that are
reachable in that region or municipality. Hence, in terms of the target sample,
5 enumerators were sent to the biggest region and municipality (i.e. KMC and
WCR). For the remaining regions or municipality (LRR, NBR, CRR, URR, and
BJL), an enumerator was sent to each. Given that in LRR there were few inactive
wallet holders, the enumerator that covered BJL also covered LRR.
Before the start of the survey, two days training of enumerators on usage of
data collection tool and administering of questionnaire was carried out. The rst
day of the training focused on making sure that enumerators and supervisors
understand the rationale of the study and also going through the entire question-
naire with them to ensure that they understand every module and question on
it. The second day of the training was divided into two parts. For the rst part,
a simple test was given to the participants that gauged their understanding of
the lessons of the rst day. After that, a general review of the rst day was done,
and training on how to use the data collection tool was done. The second part
12of day two, then, focused on simulation exercises to foster better understanding
of both the software and the questionnaire. The simulations exercises were done
in both pairs and in groups.
Before starting the survey, a pre-test of the questionnaire was also done. To
this eect, inactive wallets outside the evaluation sample were used. Specically,
we randomly selected about 34 clients in the sampling frame. Therefore, each
enumerator was assigned two respondents to interview. Hence, the pre-test lasted
for a day. No major issues regarding the questionnaire came up during the pre-
test. The minors issues that came up were issues related to the use of CAPI tool.
The identied issues were all addressed before the beginning of the survey.
4.1.4 Modules Covered and Data Collection Tool
Baseline Questionnaire comprises of six (6) Modules: Individual and Household
Characteristics, Mobile Money, Financial Access and Literacy, Time Preference
(two modules to capture time inconsistency and present bias), Risk and Savings
Behaviour. The individual and household characteristics module has 32 ques-
tions covering demographic, income, and some basic household characteristics.
The module on mobile money has 20 questions covering the services used as well
as the frequency of usage of those services; the main services considered are:
Bill payments, transfers, and buying air time. Financial access and literacy part
comprise of 22 questions covering both access to nance and the level of nancial
literacy of the wallet holder. In collecting information on access to nance, we
focus on access to credit and savings. The nancial literacy module collected
information on the the wallet holder's understanding of basic nancial concepts
like ination, ability to do basic numeracy skills like calculating interest rates, as
well as his/her nancial attitudes. Both time preferences modules comprises of 3
questions to assess, respectively, time inconsistency and present bias of respon-
dents. And nally, the risk and savings behaviour module consist of 5 questions
of which two assess the risk attitude of the respondent and 3 assess the respon-
dents savings behaviour. The risk attitude questions collected information on
respondents generalize perception of risk and their understanding of risk diver-
sication. The generalize perception of risk question asked the respondents to
rate themselves on their willingness to take risk. The risk diversication asked
the respondents to a make choice between investing in one business or investing
13in multiple businesses.
For the data collection, we used a CAPI data collection tool called Survey
Solutions. Thus, the enumerators were provided with android tablets to con-
duct interviews using the survey solution interviewer app. During the survey,
all completed forms are uploaded onto the survey solution platform daily for the
supervisors to vet before they are approved. To ensure quality and consistency of
the data collected, two headquarters (HQ) users also vet all the approved forms
from the supervisors daily; these checks and balances were instituted to increase
the quality of the data collected.
4.2 Administrative Data
The administrative data is provided by QMoney on a monthly basis. The data
contains the outcome variables capturing the following transactions: cash-outs,
cash-ins, bills payment and merchant payment. All transactions made by the
wallet in the evaluation in relation to aforementioned items are sent to us monthly.
The data is used to generate outcome indicators reported here in three forms:
total amount of the transaction, average amount of the transaction and number
of times the wallet is used for that transaction. In additions to these variables,
we also generated two other variables from the administrative data, namely; (1)
an indicator variable of whether a wallet was active or not, which is one if the
wallet has been used for any of the highlighted transactions once in the last two
months (note that the denition of activeness in the baseline data was three
months) and (b) a turnover variable to capture transaction volume, which is the
sum of all transactions that were done with the wallet. The data we received has
two waves of post treatment data (i.e. Jan-Feb and Feb-Mar) and two waves for
the pretreatment as well (i.e. July-August and October). We used the data for
October and August to check whether the wallets became active when the calling
exercise started and before the intervention. We found that the just two wallets
were active in this period and they were dropped. Then the administrative data
was merged with the baseline data for the analysis.
145 APPLICATION AND RESULTS
5.1 Descriptive Statistics
5.1.1 Baseline Survey
The baseline data comes from the baseline survey that was conducted between
26th November 2018 and 23rd January 2019. The total number of inactive wal-
lets holders successfully interviewed in the baseline is about 1014 wallet holders.
About 58 percent of the evaluation sample are assigned to receive the withdrawal
discounts and 42 percent did not. In this subsection, we discuss the main results
from the baseline data using summary statistics on observable characteristics of
the holders in the evaluation sample, as well as, reporting on similarity in ob-
served characteristics between wallet holders in the control group and those in
the treatment group.
Description of the basic characteristics of the inactive wallet holders in the
experimental sample are reported in Table 1. The results show that the inactive
wallet holders are composed of mainly young people as the average age in the
sample is about 34 years. A large proportion of the inactive wallet holders in
the evaluation sample (more than 80%) are males; thus, there is a substantial
gender dierence in the sample, which could extend to the population of mobile
money users. Many of the holders are either married or not married, but the
proportion of married holders is (about 58%) higher. Many of the inactive wallet
holders are not head of their household; however, the dierence between is not
that substantial. The inactive wallet holders are living in households with an
average of 11 members. Majority of the inactive clients (about 83 %) reported
that they have been with QMoney for more than a year. A large proportion
of the inactive users have have been to school; about 91 percent have reported
that they are educated. Hence, the low usage of wallets does not seem to be
correlated with lack of education. An interesting nding is that, in terms of our
subjective measure of poverty, the inactive clients of the mobile money services do
not seem very poor. For example, the proportion of inactive wallet holders living
in a household with piped water as the main source of drinking water is about 86
percent, which is higher than the national proportion of about 47 percent (GBOS,
2017). Also, just a small proportion of the clients live in a household where the
main material of the oor is Sand or Vinyl. Just a very few proportion (about
1518 percent) of the target group reported that they are poor relative to most
households in their community. Therefore, put together, poverty does not seem
to be a factor why the inactive clients are not using their accounts. Regarding
trust of the nancial provider, the results indicate that the client have a high
level of trust of the provider. In particular, about 98 percent of the inactive users
in the evaluation sample have reported they believe that their money is safe with
QMoney. Among the few that reported that they don't think their money is safe
with QMoney, most of the distrust is motivated by lack of information about the
service.
Checking if the inactive wallets holders are credit constraint, the results in-
dicate that only 16 percent of them have requested a loan in the last 12 months
and the main reason of not requesting for a loan is not needing it. A substantial
amount of the inactive clients have access to a bank account; just about 36% of
the respondent reported not having a bank account. Ownership of ATM cards
among clients with bank accounts is about 32%. For inactive wallet holders with
bank accounts, the primary usage of the accounts is for savings; about 95 per-
cent reported that they use their bank accounts mainly for savings. A signicant
number of the inactive wallet holders do also use alternative means of savings,
i.e. savings via means dierent from ownership of bank accounts; for instance,
about 58 percent have reported that they do keep money in the household or in
a cash box. Regarding nancial literacy, the result shows that, even though a
large proportion of the clients have a basic understanding of ination and basic
numeracy skills (not surprising given a signicant proportion are educated), still
a signicant number of the respondents lack such understanding or skills; for
example, more than 40 percent do not understand ination. Regarding prefer-
ence for risk, the results indicate that most of the inactive wallet holders are risk
averse, but a substantial proportion (about 40%) do prefer taking risk.2.
A test of balance of individual and household characteristics of wallet holders
in the control group and those in the treatment group, using a simple t-test, are
reported in the fourth column of Table 2. Also shown in the table is the mean and
standard deviation of each covariate for each group. The results show that, with
2The measure of risk averseness is computed from the risk question that asked respondent to
rate their willingness to take risk using a scale between 0 and 10. Therefore, all those that
rated themselves below 5, 5, and above 5 are, respectively, regarded as risk averse, neutral, and
lover
16the exception of the proportion of wallet holders that attended school and pro-
portion that own a formal bank account, which are, respectively, lower and higher
for the treatment group and mildly signicant, evidence exists that the respon-
dents in the two groups are similar in their observable characteristics. Thus, as
expected randomization succeed in making the two group similar in their charac-
teristics at baseline. Also reported in Table 2, is the F-test for a joint signicance
of the covariates in predicting the probability of receiving treatment. The results
imply that the covariates are jointly insignicant in predicting treatment status.
Thus, the balance of observable characteristics is obtained. Reported in Table ??
are the average of the covariates for wallet holders in the two treatment groups
(i.e either receiving the 15% or 30% withdrawal charges discount). Like in Table
2, the results from the t-test of dierence in means are reported in last column of
the table. Therefore, we see that except for three observable characteristics (Gen-
der, number of assets own, and income from wage employment as primary income
source), all the covariates are statistically similar for inactive wallet holders in
two groups. The results of the F-test reported in the Table ??imply that the
observable covariates are also irrelevant in determining who receives a 15 percent
or 30 percent subsidy on withdrawal charges. In Table 4, we report the results
from the test of dierence in average covariates between wallet holders in each
treatment group and wallet holders in the control group. The results from this
exercise indicate that generally the observable characteristics of inactive wallet
holders in the dierent treatment arms are similar to those in the control arm; in
particular, except for two indicators (whether the individual has gone to school
or not and the main material for the oor of the individual's household dwelling)
all characteristics are statistically similar for the individuals in the two treatment
arms and those in the control arm. In this regard, the probability of receiving one
of the two withdrawal subsidies can be considered as random; the results from
the F-test on joint signicance reinforces this conclusion.
Notice that the sample size reported in this section is less than the target
sample size of 2625 respondents. This come from the fact that due to the chal-
lenges highlighted in section 4.1.2 and time constraints, we had to discontinue
the baseline data collection without reaching the target sample, which was based
on getting a 0.135 eect size on the holder's net account balance.3Given the
3Note that this sample size accounts for 44% of non-response. Thus, the actual target sample
17implication this could have on the power of the study to detect the eect size we
are after, we had to redo our power analysis using the new sample size of 1012
wallets. We nd that, except for net wallet balance, for all the other indicators,
the new sample size still provides a power of 0.80 to detect an eect size of 0.135.
For the net account balance, with a 0.80 power, the study detect just eect sizes
of 0.20 and above. Even though the change in eect size for net account bal-
ance is substantial, it is still possible to detect an acceptable level of eect size.
Hence, relying on 1012 successful interviews to evaluate our intervention aects,
with regards to power, only the net account balance indicator. In addition, the
fact that up to about 60% of the respondents successfully contacted were willing
to participate in the study, implies that we have a very good response rate.
5.1.2 Administrative Data
The descriptive statistics of the administrative data are reported in table 4. Be-
tween January 26th and April 26th 2019, about 7 percent of the evaluation sample
became active. If considered by group, about 6 percent of the control group be-
came active while 7 percent of the pooled treatment became active. However, the
rate of activeness is higher for treatment 1 (about 9 percent) relative to treat-
ment 2 (about 5 percent); this result is strange given that the subsidy is higher
for wallets in treatment 2 than treatment 1.
The average turnover in the overall sample for the rst three months is GMD
240 (about 6 dollars). The turnover for the active wallets in the control group
is about GMD 243 (about 5.7 dollars) and about GMD 223.8 (about 4.7 dollars)
in the pooled treatment. The level of transaction volume is substantially higher
for treatment 2 (about GMD 286 or 6 dollars) than it is for treatment 1 (about
GMD 189 or 3.5 dolloars). Therefore, treatment 2 has the highest mean turnover
even though the rate of activeness in this group much lower. Note that when we
focus on just the active group, turnover is substantially higher. In particular, the
mean turnover for the active group is about 7056 (about 144 dolloars per month).
The variability in mean turnover is quite substantial.
For cash ins, the average total cash-in in the three months for wallets in the
treatment group is about GMD 128 and it is about GMD 118 for the control
group, but for the active wallets this is about GMD 885 and GMD 1120, respec-
size is 1798 wallets.
18tively. The number of cash-ins is also higher for the control group. Specically,
the average number of cash-in the evaluation sample is 0.05 times while it is
0.11 and 0.10, respectively for the control and pooled treatment. When we focus
on just the active users, it is about 0 times in the overall sample. Regarding
cash-out, which is the indicator directly aected by the withdrawal subsidy, the
average cash out in the overall sample is about GMD 56 and for the active group
it is GMD 977. The variability in cash-out is substantial; variability in average
cash-out in the evaluation sample is about GMD 532 . For number of cash-outs,
it is about 0.05 times in the evaluation sample with a variability of 0.3 times.
Number of cash-out by wallets in the pooled treatment group is higher than
those in the control group. Unsurprisingly, cash-out is substantially higher for
the wallets receiving the biggest subsidy. For bill payments, which involves using
a wallet for buying airtime or buying electricity KWh, the average amount spent
on telephone and electricity bills is about GMD 9.00 in the evaluation sample.
The average bill pay is much more higher for wallets in the control group than
wallets in any of the treatment arms. Specically, the average amount of bills
paid with treated wallets is about GMD 9 and it is about GMD 18. For the active
group, mean bills paid for the wallets is GMD 422 and GMD 25, respectively.
Thus, the variability in bill payment in the evaluation sample is quite substantial.
The number of times a wallet is used for bill payments is also substantially higher
for the control group. For the two treatments, the mean bills paid with a wallet
is higher for wallets in treatment 1. The table also shows that not many of the
wallets are used for settling merchant payments. In the evaluation sample, the
average number of times a wallet is used for merchant payment is about 0.006
times. Thus, this element of the wallet is hugely underutilized. The summary
statistics by month is reported in table 4a, 4b, and 4c.
5.2 Preliminary Experimental Results
Table 5 presents the results on from the estimation of average treatment eects
(ATT) using the rst three waves of the monthly administrative data; the ad-
min. data is the main source of data for the outcome variables of interest. The
results indicate that the intervention increases the proportion of active wallets
by about 1.1%. In other words, about 1.1% more wallets in the treatment than
in the control group became in three months active. Column 3 and 4 of the
19table indicates that the dierence in the proportion active between control and
treatment 1 and treatment 2 is higher for treatment 1. Specically, proportion
of active wallets is about 2.4% higher for treatment 1 while it is less 1 percent
higher for treatment two. Thus, the intervention seems to increase activeness
more in the rst treatment than in the second treatment. As mentioned in the
preceding graph, given that the main aspect of the intervention is discounting of
prices of withdrawals, this result is surprising. However, given the price discount
is combine with a monthly telephone call reminder, it could be the increase in
information that is deriving the results rather than the discount itself. Having
said that, it is important to note that intervention is still ongoing and perhaps
at the end of the intervention period these results might change.
Regarding impact of the intervention on turnover, the average mean turnover
for the control, as reported in table 5, is about GMD 244. Average mean turnover
for wallets in the pooled treatment is about GMD 16 lower than in the control.
But, the average mean turnover is GMD 43 higher for the wallets in treatment
2 than in the control group. The average turnover is substantially lower (about
GMD 92) for wallets in treatment 1 than in the control group. The results further
highlight that the wallets in the control group have a higher (about GMD 11
more) mean total cashin compared to wallets in the pooled treatment. However,
the mean dierence in cashin between wallets in the control and in treatment 2 is
positive indicating that average total cash-out of the latter group is about GMD
26 higher. However, the dierences are not statistically signicant.
Contrary to the cash-in, the average total cash out is higher for both pooled
treatment and the individual treatment groups compared to the control group.
But the mean number of cash-outs is lower for the treatment 1 and mildly higher
for the pooled treatment than for the control group. Thus, despite the eect
on total cash-out being positive for all the treatment sub-samples, the eect on
number of cash-out is mixed. Furthermore, the results imply that the intervention
increases cash-outs, but, the eect, like all the treatment eect estimates, is not
also statistically signicant. The eect of the intervention on Bill and Merchant
payment (i.e. using the wallet to make payment in shops) are negatives and
statistically insignicant. Thus, the intervention does not seem to increase the
usage of wallets for other payments such as buying airtime, electricity units, and
paying in shops. Again, it is important to view these results with care as the
20intervention is still ongoing.
6 CONCLUSION AND POLICY RECOMMEN-
DATION
Access to digital nancial services in developing countries as a means for broader
nancial inclusion continue to be an issue of huge policy relevance. One of the
things that inhibit the use of such services is high transaction cost and lack of
information. In this study, we aimed at providing evidence on whether discount-
ing price of withdrawals will encourage usage of mobile money wallets. To this
end, we partner with a private mobile money provider in Gambia to pilot this ex-
periment, which involves subsidizing cash-out fees of a random group of inactive
wallet holders and study if this changes their usage behaviour. Using prelimi-
nary data, we nd evidence that price subsidy does mildly make wallets more
active but the eect is not statistically signicant. Moreover, we nd that more
wallets in the group receiving the lesser price subsidy than those receiving the
bigger price subsidy became active. Hence, while price of mobile money services
is probably a constraint, our results indicate that they may not the main barrier
to usage of the services. Meaningful discounts increase the usage of the wallets
for other transactions just marginally. Moreover, the fact the higher of the two
discounts did not increase usage more than the lower discount indicates that the
channel through which the experiment operated was information, salience and
awareness rather than price; even if our results are very preliminary and there-
fore do not account for full impact. The information element come from the fact
the wallets are reminded about their discounts every month via a telephone call.

STATIC TEXT
We would like to invite you to participate in a study on savings and digital finance. The research is being conducted jointly by
researchers from the University of The Gambia in colloboration with Qodoo Financial Services. The research is financed by the
partnership for Economic Policy (PEP). If you have any questions about this project, please feel free to ask them now or any time in
the future. 
The purpose of this study is to try to learn more about digital financial services usage and how it can be improved. We
would like to interview you several times. First, we would like to administer a background questionnaire that will include questions
about you, your family, your income, your assets, and other related subjects. That first survey, which I would administer today, will
take about 45 minutes. Second, we would like to come back to interview again six months. When we come back, we would like to
administer a questionnaire that will include questions about your income, expenditures, business, and among others. 
There is no
risk for you if you decide to participate in the study. There are no direct benefits; however, your participation will help academics and
policymakers understand the impact of digital finance usage and how it can be improved. 
Each time we would fill in the survey with
you, we would keep your answers confidential. No one you know would have access to your answers. Only my colleagues at UTG
and Qodoo would look at them. 
If you don’t want to be in this study, you don’t have to participate. Remember, being in this study is
up to you and no one will be upset if you don’t want to participate or even if you change your mind later and want to stop. Even if you
agree to participate in the study, you won’t have to answer all the questions in the surveys if you don’t want to. Answering the
questions is up to you and no one will be upset if you don’t want to answer a given question or if you want to stop the survey in the
middle. Also, even if you agree to participate in the study now, no one from UTG will be allowed to ask you additional questions in
the future without asking for your consent again. You can quit the project at any time. 
All of the information that we obtain from you
during the research will be kept strictly confidential. While there is a small chance that the confidentiality of the information collected
could be compromised, we will take care to prevent this from happening. Each person interviewed will have their own ID number and
your information will only be identified by this ID number after it has been input and the data is being analyzed.Your name and other
identifying information about you will not be used in any reports of the research. All data from the survey will be properly archived.
