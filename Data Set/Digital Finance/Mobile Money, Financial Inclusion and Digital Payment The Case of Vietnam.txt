Abstract  
The study provides an overview of mobile money account usage, financial inclusion and digital payment transaction 
trends in Vietnam, and considers the factors influencing these trends. In general, the rates of using mobile money 
service and account ownership at financial intermediaries in Vietnam are still low, and other indicators of digital 
transactions suggest low levels compared to those of countries with low - and middle - income as well  as to the world 
averages. The research also shows that owning an account at a financial intermediary facilitates the use of mobile 
money. This is a positive trend, at least compared to the situation in some African countries. Finally, having an 
account at  a financial intermediary and using mobile money services generally have a positive effect on the 
participation in non -cash transactions.

1. Introduction  
In recent years, developing an inclusive financial system serving all members of society has become an important 
policy in many countries, especially emerging economies. Financial inclusion (FI) is the provision of appropriate and 
convenient financial services for i ndividuals, households and businesses. Notably, mobile devices have played an 
important role in promoting inclusive finance in developing countries (Kanobe, Alexander, & Bwalya, 2017). 
Thanks to being highly mobile, ubiquitously available and personalized,  mobile phones have quickly spread not only 
in developed countries but also in most developing countries, overcoming geographical barriers. According to 
GSMA (2015), in the last decade, mobile money has helped expand financial services more than what tradi tional 
banks did in the last century. The GSMA report also found that at least 19 countries had more mobile money 
accounts than bank accounts and 37 countries had 10 times more mobile money agents than bank branches.  
In Vietnam, since 2016, the State Bank has cooperated with World Bank experts to develop a national financial 
inclusion strategy. Having a large population with low financial literacy, Vietnam is among the 25 countries 
priortizing to focus on financial inc lusion (FI) efforts from the Universal Access to Finance (UFA) initiative in 2020. 
The goal of this initiative is to help people who are not currently using banking services have access to the formal 
financial system. Assisting an adult to open a trading a ccount is the first step towards FI. People can then use the 
services they need such as savings, payments, loans and insurance. Bringing formal financial services to millions of 
people who currently have little or no use of financial services will help Vie tnam achieve both its goals of poverty 
reduction and economic growth, helping the country to achieve its stated goals in Vietnam 2035 report.  
At the 2019 Plan Implementation Conference of the Ministry of Information and Communications, the Prime 
Minister agreed to allow a pilot use of a telecom account for payment, which will have a strong impact on non -cash 
payments, promote trade and safety and reduce costs, cash circulation and other means of payment within and 
outside the banking system. This is also t he main basis for mobile money to thrive and play an important role in 
promoting financial inclusion in Vietnam.  http://ijfr.sciedupress.com  International Journal of Financial Research  V ol. 11, No.  1; 2020

provides evidence on the link between mobile money and financial inclusion and digital payment transaction trends 
in Vietnam. The current study makes a major contribution in this sense. The objective of this study is to analyze the 
factors affecting individuals' use of mobile mone y service in Vietnam employing World Bank's Global Findex data 
(2018). In addition, the study also analyzes the nexus between the use of mobile money and financial inclusion and 
digital payment activities in Vietnam.  
Logit regression with robust standard e rrors is used to estimate the determinants of the likelihood to use mobile 
money services and have accounts at financial intermediaries, and the impact of mobile money and having an 
account at a financial intermediary on the ability to use digital transact ions. The results reveal that mobile money and 
financial intermediation accounts are not mutually exclusive, but complementary. Besides, mobile money accounts 
and financial intermediaries generally have a positive effect on the trend of non -cash transactio ns in Vietnam.  
2. Previous Stud ies on the  Relationship Between Mobile Money, Digital Payment Transactio ns and Financial 
Inclusion  
Financial exclusion is a pervasive problem in developing countries: while bank account ownership is quite popular in 
high-income OECD countries, roughly half of adults in developing countries have bank accounts (Demirguc -Kunt et 
al, 2015). The significant disparities between developed and developing countries are due to the fact that financial 
service providers are unabl e to expand their reach to the poor at an affordable expense, for it is costly to set up and 
operate bank branches. However, the advent of mobile technology is revolutionizing access to financial services by 
changing the way people send/receive money, save , borrow and manage risk. Indeed, one area in which mobile 
phone penetration has impacted economic growth is by expanding mobile financial services to those who are 
financially excluded (Andrianaivo & Kpodar, 2012).  
Mobile financial services (MFS) involve the use of mobile phones to access financial services. MFS has been 
considered as an innovative and effective means of inclusive financial development by providing financial services 
to people who do not have access to banking services (Sihvonen, 2006). MF S includes a variety of financial services 
such as mobile payment, domestic and international money transfers. Mobile banking is a service that provides 
customers with a channel to interact with the bank via mobile devices (Barnes & Corbitt, 2003). On the other hand, 
mobile payments involve the use of mobile devices to pay for goods or services at point of sale or remote locations 
(KPMG, 2011) and are increasingly used in developed countries. Mobile money transfers, like the case of m - Pesa 
in Kenya, are c ommon in developing countries where users are reducing access to bank accounts but there is a high 
demand for sending and receiving money in the community. Remittance operations involve international remittance, 
often used by migrant workers who send money  back to their home countries. Today, traditional money transfer 
service providers are subject to competition from telecom providers with advanced technology and lower service 
costs (Merritt, 2011).  
The importance of mobile technology in expanding financia l services to the poor at an affordable cost is due to the 
initial investment and other fixed costs, so the marginal cost is very low for every transaction or for every new 
customer (Honohan and Beck, 2011). This has led to the rapid expansion of mobile mo ney and MFS in developing 
countries, thereby promoting financial inclusion in these countries (Hinson, 2011; Maurer, 2012). These services 
have helped overcome infrastructure constraints and improve inclusive finance (Allen et al., 2014; Hinson, 2011; 
Maur er, 2012). Asongu et al. (2017) analyzed the use of mobile devices in African countries and showed that MFS 
has a positive impact on the financial development of these countries.  
3. Statistical Indicators on Mobile Money Account s and Digital Payment Transa ction s in Vietnam  
The data used in this study cover indicators of mobile money accounts, financial institution accounts and digital payment 
transactions from the Global Findex data of the World bank (2018). In the dataset, (1) mobile money account is the 
proportion of individuals who have used mobile money service in the past 12 months; (2) account at a financial 
intermediary is the percentage of individuals who solely or jointly own accounts at banks or financial institutions such as 
credit cooperatives, m icrofinance institutions, etc., or own debit card; (3) digital payment transaction is the ratio of 
individuals using mobile money, credit or debit cards, or mobile phones to make payments from accounts, or using the 
internet to pay or buy online merchandis e. This index also includes the percentage of individuals who pay bills, send and 
receive money, receive salaries, allowances ... via accounts at financial intermediaries or via mobile money accounts in the 
past 12 months.  
Table 1 shows  that the proportion of individuals owning accounts in financial intermediaries has increased from 21.4% in 
2011 to 30% in 2017 in Vietnam, which is still lower than that of low - and middle -income countries and the world average.  http://ijfr.sciedupress.com  International Journal of Financial Research  V ol. 11, No.  1; 2020

Regarding the rate of using mobile money service, although in Vietnam this rate has increased from 0.5% in 2014 to 
3.5% in 2017, this is still lower than other countries with low and middle income and also lower than the world 
average.

For digital payment transactions, the percentage of these transactions in Vietnam is generally lower than the world 
average and countries with low and middle income levels (Table 3). However the proportions of transactions such as 
using accounts to receive wages from the private sector; using the internet to pay bills and buy things online ; using 
mobile phone or internet to access accounts in Vietnam are higher than those of countries with low and middle 
income levels. This reflects the strong development of mobile networks and the Internet in Vietnam compared to 
countries with low and midd le income levels, and also reflects the strong development trend of e -commerce. This is 
a very favorable basis for developing payment services through telecommunication accounts, as well as developing 
mobile money to promote inclusive finance in Vietnam.

4. Methodology  
4.1 Determinants of Mobile Mon ey  
The data used in this study cover indicators of mobile money accounts, financial institution accounts and digital payment 
transactions from the Global Findex data of the World bank. Logistic regression is employed in this study to evaluate 
several determin ants of mobile money usage in Vietnam, and other models below. Logistic regression is used 
because the dependent variable is a dichotomous one, i.e. having only two possible outcomes. This approach is 
actually a special case of linear regression, and it he lps predict the possibility of occurrence of an event through http://ijfr.sciedupress.com  International Journal of Financial Research  V ol. 11, No.  1; 2020

mobile money in Vietnam:  
                                                                  (1) 
Where               denotes of using mobile money of an individual i, receiving the value of i if the individual 
has mobile money account  and 0 otherwise ;              is the indicator of financial inclusion, receiving the value 
of 1 if the individual has accounts at financial intermediaries  and zero otherwise ; Xi is a vector of control variables; 
and    is the error term. The control variables include individual gender; age; educational level, income group; with 
a purpose to pay utility bills;  borrow money from a financial institution; have received wages within the past 12 
months.  
4.2 Effects of Mobile Mon ey on Financial Inclu sion 
To quantify the effect of mobile money on financial inclusion, the following equation is estimated:  
                                                                  (2) 
Where               is the indicator of financial inclusion, receiving the value of 1 if the individual has accounts at 
financial intermediaries  and zero otherwise ;              denotes of using mobile money of an individual i, 
receiving the value of 1 if the individual has mobile money account  and 0 otherwise ; Other variables are defined the 
same as in equation (1) and    is the error term.  
4.3 Effects of Mobile Mon ey and Financial Inclusi on on Digital Payment Transa ctions  
To quantify the effect of mobile money and financial  inclusion on digital payment transactions, the following model 
will be estimated:  
                                                                          (3) 
Where                 is digital payment transactions  such as: receive government transfers / remittances, receiving 1 
if in cash and 0 otherwise; transfer money in cash, receiving 1 if money is not transferred in cash and 0 otherwise, 
debit_credit: whether the individual has a debit or credit card, 1 if yes, 0 if no;  debit_credit_use: whether the 
individual has debit or credit card transactions, 1 if yes, 0 if no; delivery_int_cash: pay online, receiving 1 if payment 
is not in cash and 0 if otherwise  ; billpaid_cash: pay utility bill, receiving 1 if pay bill by cash a nd 0 if otherwise; 
wage_cash: get salary, receiving 1 if in cash and 0 if  otherwise  ;              is the indicator of financial inclusion, 
receiving the value of 1 if the individual has accounts at financial intermediaries  and zero otherwise ;              
denotes of using mobile money of an individual 1, receiving the value of 1 if the individual has mobile money 
account  and 0 otherwise ; Other variables are defined the same as in equation (1) and    is the error term.  
5. Results and Discussion  
This study uses Logit regression to estimate: (1) the impact of factors on the ability to use mobile money services 
and have accounts at financial intermediaries; (2) The impact of mobile money and having an account at a financial 
intermediary on the ability to use d igital transactions. The data used in the study is from the World Bank survey in 
2017 (The Global Findex Database) results for Vietnam, with a sample of 1,002 people.  
According to Table 4 (column 1), the Logit regression result shows that the independent v ariables can explain 17.56% 
of the variation of the dependent variables (likelihood of using mobile money service). The independent variables 
including account use at financial intermediaries and the income level are statistically significant at the 1%, wh ile the 
age variable is significant at 5%. Specifically, the variable account_fin has a coefficient > 0, which means that the 
use of accounts at financial intermediaries has a positive correlation with the probability of using mobile money 
services. The va riable age has a coefficient < 0, implying that age has a negative correlation with the probability of 
using mobile money. The variable inc_q has a coefficient > 0, meaning that the higher the income, the more likely it 
is to use mobile money.  
According to  Table 4 (column 2), the Logit model shows that the independent variables can explain 18.89% of the 
variation of the dependent variables (bank account ownership). The independent variables including age, education 
level, income level, having payroll within  12 months and the use of mobile money have statistical significance at the 
1% level, while the variable for borrowing money from financial institutions is significant 10%. Specifically, the 
account_mob variable has a coefficient > 0, which means that the use of mobile money can increase the likelihood of http://ijfr.sciedupress.com  International Journal of Financial Research  V ol. 11, No.  1; 2020 
Published by Sciedu Press                         421                          ISSN 1923 -4023   E-ISSN 1923 -4031  owning a bank account. The age variable has a positive coefficient, suggesting that the older the customer, the more 
likely she is to have a bank account.  
Thus, compared to mobile money accounts, accounts  at financial intermediaries may be more universal and 
necessary, especially for individuals who are older. The variables educ, rec_wage_payment and inc_q all have 
positive coefficients, indicating that more educated, employed individuals with higher real income are more likely to 
own a bank account. Finally, the variable borrow_fininst has a positive coefficient, consistent with the fact that 
borrowers will open an account at the lender to track payments as well as to disburse the loan.

Table 5 provides logistic regression results that examine the factors that influence individuals' likelihood to choose 
non-cash transactions in Vietnam. Column (1) shows that the model is able to explain 14.86% of the dynamics of the 
dependent variable, an d individuals with bank accounts will be less likely to receive cash payments from government. 
Column (2) shows that the model accounts for 41.17% of the variation of the dependent variable, and that individuals 
with higher education levels are more likely  to receive wages in many forms other than cash. Owning mobile money 
accounts and financial intermediaries also facilitates the receipt of non -cash salary payments. Column (3) also shows http://ijfr.sciedupress.com  International Journal of Financial Research  V ol. 11, No.  1; 2020

explains 18.13 % of the dependent variable fluctuation.  
Column (4) shows that the older individuals are less likely to own a credit or debit card, this result may be due to the 
influence of the highly elderl y individuals in the sample. In addition, individuals with high incomes and the need to 
pay utility bills tend to own more cards. Finally, individuals with accounts at financial intermediaries will also be 
more likely to own debit or credit cards. This mod el have a highly explanatory power (66.7% of the variation of the 
dependent variable). Column (5) shows that individuals with a high level of education and a mobile money account 
are also more likely to use the card more often. Thus, the results in column (5) of table 5 and the results in table 4 
imply a mutual rather than confrontational relationship of these two types of accounts. This result shows the opposite 
trend with African countries as documented in Fanta et al. (2016), in which the two types of ac counts tend to replace 
each other.  
Column (6) shows that individuals with mobile money accounts are prone to choose non -cash transfers, but 
individuals with financial intermediaries prefer to transfer money in cash. The model in column 6 explains 24.37% of  
the fluctuations in the variable for cash or non -cash transfers. Column (7) shows that for the payment of goods 
delivered to the recipient, individuals with mobile money accounts tend to choose to pay on the internet instead of 
cash at the time of deliver y. Meanwhile, for individuals who have accounts at financial intermediaries, this behavior 
is not statistically significant. This model explains 27.86% of the choice of internet payment or cash payment for 
goods purchased.

6. Conclusion and Implications  
This study provides an overview of the trends of mobile money accounts, financial inclusion and cashless transaction 
in Vietnam, and considers the factors that influence these trends. In general, the rates of using mobile money and 
accounts at financial intermediaries in Vietnam are still low, and other indicat ors suggest that non -cash transaction 
trends are low compared to middle and low income countries and compared to the world average. However, this 
opens up great opportunities for non -cash transactions to mushroom in Vietnam (due to the fact that there is s till 
room for growth), along with the trend of promoting inclusive finance and e -commerce in the segment boom 
compared to other countries in the region and around the world.  
The study also shows that mobile money and financial intermediation accounts are n ot mutually exclusive, but 
complementary. This is a positive trend, at least compared to the situation in some African countries. Mobile money 
accounts and financial intermediaries generally have a positive effect on the trend of non -cash transactions. The  
current problem is that the rates of using mobile money and accounts at financial intermediaries in Vietnam are quite 
limited compared to the common levels of other countries. To build a non -cash economy, it is necessary to continue 
to facilitate these fo rms to thrive through the development of updated legal frameworks, support for technologies that 
ensure speed and safety in non -cash transactions.  
This study only use s cross -sectional data, so the variation across time is not available, and it is a single country study. 
Further studies could enrich the data by including more countries to examine whether there are differences in the 
above links across economies, or to build the panel data for Vietnamese observations. Also, researchers could 
analyze the impac t of various aspects of mobile money such as mobile payment delivered by FinTech companies and 
innovative financial service providers on financial inclusion and digital payment transactions. As mentioned earlier, 
this study uses accounts at financial inter mediaries to measure financial inclusion, other studies could analyze digital 
financial inclusion - digital access to, and the use of, formal financial services - to test the robustness of the results of 
this study.
