ABSTRACT
 
 
Despite
 
the
 
expansive
 
infrastructure
 
of
 
commercial
 
banking
 
in
 
Kenya,
 
a
 
large
 
percentage
 
of
 
the
 
country’s
 
population
 
is
 
excluded
 
from
 
access
 
to
 
formal
 
banking
 
services/products.
 
Further,
 
there
 
is
 
insufficiency
 
of
 
credible
 
information
 
on
 
the
 
manner
 
that
 
digital
 
banking
 
strategies
 
relates
 
to
 
inclusion
 
on
 
access
 
to
 
financial
 
services.
 
Accordingly,
 
this
 
study
 
was
 
in
 
search
 
of
 
bridging
 
the
 
gap
 
with
 
the
 
objective
 
of
 
evaluating
 
the
 
effects
 
of
 
the
 
digital
 
banking
 
strategy
 
on
 
financial
 
inclusion
 
midst
 
commercial
 
banks
 
in
 
Kajiado
 
County
 
(a
 
case
 
of
 
Kenya
 
commercial
 
bank
 
in
 
Kajiado
 
county).
 
This
 
research
 
utilised
 
quantitative

outlets
 
(branches
 
and
 
bank
 
agents)
 
in
 
Kajiado
 
County
 
for
 
its

population
 
and
 
obtained
 
a

The

The

recommends
 
that
 
the

INTRODUCTION
 
 
1.1
 
Background
 
of
 
the
 
Study
 
 
Nowadays,
 
the
 
most
 
dominant
 
channel
 
of
 
financial
 
intermediation
 
in
 
emerging
 
economies,
 
like
 
Kenya,
 
is
 
that
 
of
 
commercial
 
banks
 
[1].
 
More
 
so,
 
Ongore
 
and
 
Kusa
 
[2]
 
indicate
 
that
 
commercial
 
banks
 
have
 
their
 
core
 
function
 
as
 
being;
 
accepting
 
deposits,
 
lending
 
money
 
(funds)
 
and
 
to
 
offering
 
funds’
 
transfer
 
services
 
which
 
links
 
them
 
to
 
the
 
rest
 
of
 
the
 
economy.
 
Access
 
to
 
banking
 
is
 
thus
 
essential
 
in
 
any
 
country
 
and
 
this
 
explains
 
the
 
need
 
of
 
making
 
banking
 
services
 
accessible
 
and
 
attractive
 
to
 
everyone
 
without
 
prejudice
 
[3].
 
Financial
 
inclusion
 
ensures
 
that
 
more
 
people
 
are
 
included
 
in
 
the
 
formal
 
financial
 
system,
 
which
 
promotes
 
commercial
 
banks
 
to
 
being
 
the
 
domina
nt
 
financial
 
intermediation
 
channel
 
for
 
financial
 
inclusion
 
and
 
thus
 
requiring
 
these
 
banks
 
to
 
initiate
 
easy
 
accessibility
 
of
 
financial
 
services
 
[2
,
3].
 
 
World
 
Bank
 
[4]
 
approves
 
financial
 
inclusion
 
as
 
a
 
viable
 
avenue
 
for
 
promoting
 
poverty
 
reduction
 
and
 
socio
-
economic
 
inequality,
 
playing
 
a
 
key
 
role
 
in
 
fostering
 
sustainable
 
and
 
balanced
 
economic
 
growth.
 
This
 
demands
 
for
 
everyone
 
to
 
be
 
capable
 
of
 
equally
 
accessing
 
every
 
foreseeable
 
products/services
 
provided
 
by
 
commercial
 
banks
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
bank
 
accounts,
 
money
 
transfer
 
services
 
and
 
the
 
like
 
in
 
order
 
to
 
claim
 
sufficiency
 
in
 
financial
 
inclusion
 
[5].
 
However,
 
Soriano
 
[3]
 
postulates
 
that,
 
as
 
of
 
today,
 
an
 
estimated
 
2
 
billion
 
adults
 
are
 
financially
 
excluded.
 
More
 
so,
 
World
 
Bank
 
[6]
 
poses
 
that
 
majority
 
of
 
the
 
financially
 
disadvantaged
 
and
 
the
 
vulnerable
 
Bottom
 
of
 
the
 
Pyramid
 
[BoP]
 
society
 
live
 
on
 
wages
 
of
 
less
 
than
 
$2.00
 
a
 
day.
 
Consequently,
 
with
 
no
 
doubt,
 
the
 
unbanked
 
population
 
would
 
abruptly
 
shoot
 
to
 
the
 
tune
 
3.5
 
billion
 
when
 
they
 
continue
 
being
 
discriminated
 
from
 
formal
 
banking
 
services
 
such
 
as
 
loans
 
 
[7].
 
In
 
their
 
effort
 
to
 
spur
 
financial
 
inclusion,
 
commercial
 
banks
 
are
 
adopting
 
digital
 
banking
 
strategy
 
as
 
a
 
financial
 
channel
 
for
 
delivering
 
services/products
 
securely,
 
effectively
 
and
 
reliably
 
to
 
satisfy
 
increasingly
 
complex
 
demands
 
and
 
challenges
 
of
 
globalization
 
[8].
 
Importantly,
 
it
 
increases
 
protection
 
for
 
the
 
cash
 
of
 
the
 
people
 
and
 
is
 
more
 
comfortable
 
than
 
keeping
 
money
 
at
 
home
 
/
 
moving
 
with
 
the
 
money
 
[9].
 
It
 
is
 
cheap
 
to
 
access
 
digital
 
finance,
 
this
 
allow
 
low
-
income
 
and
 
disadvantaged
 
people
 
to
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
participate
 
in
 
the
 
financial
 
system,
 
this
 
has
 
positive
 
impacts
 
on
 
financial
 
inclusion
 
[10].
 
This
 
strengthens
 
households
 
as
 
it
 
allows
 
majority
 
of
 
the
 
country’s
 
population
 
to
 
play
 
their
 
role
 
of
 
economic
 
growth
 
and
 
employment,
 
which
 
aims
 
to
 
further
 
promote
 
programs
 
that
 
bring
 
about
 
social
 
development
 
[11].
 
 
Digital
 
banking
 
strategy
 
is
 
in
 
the
 
lineage
 
of
 
automated
 
teller
 
machines
 
(ATM),
 
whose
 
origin
 
is
 
telephony
 
lines
 
banking
 
that
 
expanded
 
to
 
M
-
banking
 
and
 
I
-
banking
 
[8].
 
It
 
extends
 
traditional
 
banking
 
services
 
to
 
innovative,
 
modern
 
platforms
 
including
 
solutions
 
for
 
electronic
 
money
 
(E
-
Money)
 
which
 
include
 
the
 
M
-
Banking
 
solutions,
 
Internet
 
banking
 
(I
-
banking)
 
solutions
 
and
 
digital
 
payments.
 
This
 
strategy
 
generally
 
involves
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
modern
 
technology,
 
including
 
electronic
 
money
 
(e
-
money),
 
electronic
 
money
 
(M
-
Cash,
 
e
-
card
 
and
 
EFT)
 
as
 
an
 
avenue
 
for
 
the
 
transacting
 
financially
 
[12].
 
 
1.2
 
Statement
 
of
 
the
 
Problem
 
 
Today,
 
an
 
estimated
 
2
 
billion
 
adults
 
around
 
the
 
globe
 
are
 
financially
 
excluded;
 
accounting
 
for
 
around
 
half
 
the
 
global
 
population
 
of
 
adults
 
[6
,
3].
 
In
 
Kenya,
 
an
 
estimated
 
61.6%
 
of
 
its
 
population
 
is
 
still
 
unbanked
 
[13].
 
While
 
accessibility
 
to
 
financial
 
services
 
has
 
been
 
a
 
problem
 
in
 
Kenya
 
for
 
a
 
long
 
time,
 
financial
 
sector
 
stakeholders
 
have
 
unanimously
 
agreed
 
that
 
financial
 
services
 
access
 
is
 
limited
 
in
 
Kajiado
 
County.
 
Also,

percentage
 
of
 
Kajiado
 
County’s
 
population
 
is
 
financially
 
excluded,
 
a
 
situation
 
ameliorated
 
by
 
the
 
geographical
 
location
 
of
 
the
 
commercial
 
bank;
 
which
 
are
 
far
 
from
 
the
 
prospective
 
customers.
 
Accordingly,
 
majority
 
of
 
the
 
Kajiado
 
County
 
residents
 
have
 
been
 
derived
 
accessibility
 
to
 
formal
 
banking
 
services,
 
propagating
 
household
 
poverty.
 
Gichuki
 
and
 
Jagongo
 
[14]
 
claims
 
that
 
there
 
is
 
no
 
validly
 
reliable
 
information
 
on
 
digital
 
banking
 
strategy
 
and
 
its
 
connection
 
with
 
financial
 
inclusion
 
in
 
Kenya.
 
This
 
demands
 
for
 
immediately
 
producing
 
more
 
empirical
 
research
 
to
 
reveal
 
the
 
hidden
 
valuable
 
and
 
treasured
 
information
 
to
 
assist
 
in
 
propelling
 
financial
 
inclusion
 
and
 
hence
 
mitigate
 
financial
 
exclusion.
 
This
 
persuaded
 
the
 
researcher
 
to
 
carry
 
out
 
a
 
research
 
for
 
unlocking
 
this
 
knowledge
 
gap.

The
 
theory
 
suggest
 
that
 
innovations
 
are
 
a
 
crucial
 
motivating
 
force
 
of
 
the
 
financial
 
system
 
for
 
creating
 
greater
 
technical
 
maturity
 
and
 
maximizing
 
the
 
economic
 
advantage
 
of
 
recent
 
and
 
ongoing
 
improvements
 
[15].
 
Financial
 
inclusion
 
characterizes
 
financial
 
developments
 
by
 
considering
 
better
 
production
 
approaches,
 
technical
 
solutions
 
that
 
ensure
 
higher
 
rates
 
of
 
return
 
and
 
thus
 
boost
 
the
 
economy
 
of
 
the
 
country.
 
Financial
 
inclusion
 
ensure
 
that
 
assets
 
are
 
distributed
 
to
 
insufficient
 
areas
 
and
 
further
 
enable
 
deepening
 
of
 
financial
 
inclusion
 
to
 
the
 
rising
 
prospects
 
in
 
the
 
future.

Financial
 
growth theory
 
 
Bagehot
 
[17]
 
suggested
 
a
 
theoretical
 
financial
 
growth
 
theory,
 
through
 
the
 
introduction
 
of
 
an
 
efficient
 
modern
 
financial
 
system,
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
stable
 
and
 
productive
 
environment
 
for
 
economic
 
growth.
 
This
 
theory
 
presupposes
 
an
 
underlying
 
high
 
level
 
of
 
indifference
 
in
 
income
 
levels
 
partly
 
contributing
 
to
 
derailment
 
in
 
economic
 
growth
 
as
 
well
 
development
 
across
 
the
 
world,
 
particularly,
 
accessibility
 
to
 
financial
 
products
 
experienced
 
by
 
most
 
individuals
 
[1].
 
Countries
 
should
 
therefore
 
encourage
 
policymakers
 
to
 
prioritize
 
financial
 
mobility
 
by
 
focusing
 
on
 
factors
 
which
 
impact
 
financial
 
growth
 
as
 
an
 
all
-
inclusive
 
mechanism
 
for
 
fostering
 
economic
 
inclusion.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
this
 
theory
 
has
 
become
 
the
 
fundamental
 
hypothesis
 
for
 
informing
 
this
 
study;
 
concerning
 
financial
 
inclusion
 
to
 
develop
 
an
 
inclusive
 
economy.
 
Access
 
to
 
stable,
 
readily
 
accessible
 
and
 
affordable
 
financing
 
is
 
established
 
as
 
a
 
requirement
 
for
 
increasing
 
employment
 
and
 
economic
 
growth
 
and
 
thereby
 
growing
 
inequalities
 
in
 
incomes
 
earnings.
 
Digital
 
banking
 
strategy
 
establishes
 
eq
ual
 
prospect
 
and
 
hence
 
fostering
 
socially
 
excluded
 
individuals
 
into
 
participating
 
in
 
economic
 
activities
 
[17].

channels
 
were
 
meticulously
 
reviewed
 
in
 
this
 
section.
 
At
 
the
 
beginning,
 
the
 
research
 
looks
 
at
 
digital
 
banking
 
strategy
 
and
 
the
 
manner
 
in
 
which
 
it
 
relates
 
to
 
financial

and
 
thereafter,
 
there
 
is
 
review
 
of
 
each
 
strategy
 
as
 
driven
 
by
 
specific
 
research
 
objectives.
 
 
While

were
 
the
 
most

In
 
India,
 
D’Silva

.
 
[22]
 
indicate
 
that
 
India
 
is
 
committed
 
to
 
providing
 
digital
 
financial

which
 
helped
 
India
 
to
 
bring
 
most
 
of
 
its
 
population
 
into
 
formal
 
financial
 
arrangement.
 
Soriano
 
[3]
 
revealed
 
that
 
banks
 
were
 
facing
 
challenges
 
of
 
financial
 
infrastructure
 
in
 
rural
 
areas
 
which
 
acted
 
as
 
barriers
 
to
 
financial
 
inclusion
 
among
 
the
 
poor
 
and
 
marginalized
 
who
 
would
 
not
 
access
 
financial
 
products.
 
Agufa
 
[9]
 
posits
 
that
 
digital
 
financial
 
services
 
are
 
valuable
 
to
 
the
 
people
 
for
 
boosting
 
their
 
cash
 
protection
 
and
 
are
 
more
 
comfortable
 
compared
 
to
 
keeping
 
money
 
at
 
home.
 
 
Durai
 
and
 
Stella
 
[5]
 
study
 
found
 
that
 
the
 
effect
 
on
 
financial
 
inclusion
 
of
 
digital
 
finance
 
is
 
substantial,
 
and
 
that
 
everyone
 
intends
 
use
 
digital
 
finance
 
in
 
their
 
lives.
 
Moore
 
et
 
al.
 
[23]
 
indicated
 
that
 
financial
 
inclusion
 
is
 
being
 
strangled
 
by
 
failure
 
to
 
fully
 
understand
 
the
 
most
 
effective
 
design
 
and
 
delivery
 
mechanisms
 
of
 
financial
 
products/services.
 
Shofawati
 
[18]
 
shows
 
that
 
there
 
is
 
need
 
to
 
improve
 
the
 
digital

mechanisms
 
so
 
as
 
to
 
ensure
 
they
 
are
 
simple,

effective,
 
and
 
secure
 
in
 
which
 
case
 
it
 
will
 
increase
 
the

Sindani

[20]
 
concludes
 
that
 
financial

and
 
ATM
 
Banking
 
have
 
a
 
strong
 
positive
 
relation.
 
 
Haider

3.1 
Research
 
Design
 
 
This
 
study
 
opted
 
for
 
adopting
 
the
 
descriptive
 
research
 
while
 
considering
 
the
 
various
 
research
 
designs.
 
This
 
was
 
informed
 
by
 
descriptive
 
research
 
design’s
 
ability
 
of
 
effectively
 
provide
 
comprehensive
 
understandings
 
of
 
the
 
problem
 
under
 
investigation
 
and
 
accurately
 
describing
 
all
 
the
 
variables
 
at
 
hand,
 
which
 
was
 
required
 
in
 
this
 
study.
 
This
 
study
 
required
 
comprehensively
 
describing
 
the
 
characteristics
 
of
 
existing
 
phenomenon;
 
digital
 
banking
 
strategy
 
coupled
 
with
 
its
 
relation
 
to
 
and
 
financial
 
inclusion.
 
 
3.2 
Target
 
Population
 
 
The
 
target
 
population
 
must
 
have
 
similar
 
traits
 
of
 
interest
 
to
 
the
 
study.
 
Accordingly,
 
this
 
study
 
had
 
4
 
Kenya
 
commercial
 
bank
 
(KCB)
 
branches
 
and
 
319
 
licensed
 
KBC
 
Mtaani
 
agents
 
that
 
are
 
operating
 
in
 
Kajiado
 
County
 
as
 
its
 
target
 
population
 
[

].
 
Thus,
 
the
 
target
 
population
 
was
 
323
 
branches
 
and
 
agents
 
(banking
 
outlets)
 
Table

Sampling
 
Procedures
 
and
 
Techniques
 
 
Sampling
 
is
 
a
 
practice
 
of
 
obtaining
 
fewer
 
observations
 
from
 
the
 
entire
 
population
 
to
 
represent
 
the
 
whole
 
population.
 
Sampling
 
includes
 
description
 
of
 
the
 
sampling
 
method
 
and
 
sample
 
size
 
calculation.
 
In
 
determining
 
the
 
sample
 
size,
 
the
 
study
 
was
 
informed
 
by
 
the
 
formula
 
suggested
 
Yamane
 
(1967)
 
which
 
is
 
expressed
 
as
 
 
n
 
=
 
 
 
 
 
(
 
 
)
 
 
Where
 
n
 
is
 
the
 
sample
 
size,
 
N
 
is
 
the
 
target
 
population
 
size
 
and
 
e
 
is
 
the
 
level
 
of
 
precision
 
(specifically
 
±5%
 
precision
 
at
 
95%
 
confidence
 
level).
 
 
Thus
 
n
 
=
 
   
 
 
   
	
.
(
 
.
  
)
 
 
=

 
   
	
.
(

.
   
)
 
=
 
   
 
 
.
  
 
=
 
   
 
.
  
 
=
 
179.0055
 
≈179
 
 
So,
 
the
 
study
 
will
 
use
 
179
 
elements
 
as
 
its
 
sample
 
size.
 
 
The
 
study
 
then
 
used
 
stratified
 
proportionate
 
sampling
 
to
 
establish
 
the
 
sample
 
size
 
per
 
classification.
 
This
 
size
 
of
 
sample
 
from
 
each
 
classification
 
was
 
obtained
 
by
 
multiplying
 
the
 
population
 
of
 
the
 
classification
 
by
 
sample
 
size
 
and
 
dividing
 
this
 
by
 
target
 
population
 
After
 
this,
 
the
 
study
 
adopted
 
simple
 
random
 
sampling
 
to
 
select
 
the
 
outlets
 
or
 
branches
 
that
 
participated
 
in
 
data
 
collection
 
from
 
each
 
classification.
 
For
 
each
 
classification,
 
the
 
study
 
first
 
established
 
a
 
sampling
 
interval
 
(n)
 
given
 
by
 
the
 
population
 
of
 
the
 
classification
 
divided
 
by
 
the
 
sample
 
size
 
of
 
that
 
classification
.
 
Starting
 
for
 
one,
 
the
 
study
 
picked
 
the
 
n
th
 
elements
 
as
 
participants
 
in
 
the
 
study
 
until
 
the
 
sample
 
size
 
of
 
that
 
classification
 
was
 
reached.
 
Once
 
the
 
outlets
 
were
 
selected
 
then
 
their
 
managers/owners
 
were
 
considered
 
the
 
respondents.
 
 
3.4 
Research
 
Instruments
 
 
In
 
this
 
study
 
primary
 
data
 
originating
 
from
 
primary
 
sources,
 
was
 
used
 
for
 
analysis.
 
This
 
data
 
was
 
collected
 
using
 
a
 
structured
 
questionnaire
 
which
 
were
 
administered
 
to
 
the
 
respondents.
 
More
 
precisely,
 
a
 
self
-
administered
 
structured
 
questionnaire
 
was
 
used
 
as
 
the
 
tool
 
for
 
collecting
 
data
 
in
 
the
 
study.
 
This
 
questionnaire
 
was
 
administered
 
using
 
drop
 
and
 
pick
 
up
 
technique.
 
The
 
study
 
embraced
 
a
 
5
-
point
 
Likert
 
scale
 
during
 
tool
 
construction.
 
The
 
study
 
data
 
was
 
collected
 
using
 
a
 
5
-
point
 
Likert
 
scale
 
(1
 
-
 
5)
 
for
 
assisting
 
converting
 
the
 
qualitative
 
responses
 
into
 
quantitative
 
values
 
[

].
 
The
 
data
 
was
 
collected
 
using
 
drop
 
and
 
pick
 
method.
 
 
3.5 
Testing
 
for
 
Validity
 
and
 
Reliability
 
 
In
 
advance
 
of
 
administration
 
of
 
the
 
research
 
tool,
 
the
 
tool
 
was
 
pretested
 
for
 
validity
 
and
 
reliability.
 
 
The
 
content
 
validity
 
test
 
was
 
found
 
useful
 
for
 
testing
 
for
 
validity
 
in
 
this
 
study.
 
The
 
research
 
sourced
 
services
 
of;
 
supervisor
 
and
 
a
 
financial
 
management
 
specialist,
 
who
 
had
 
strong
 
financial
 
management
 
experience
 
and
 
knowledge.
 
As
 
the
 
supervisor
 
assessed
 
the
 
instrument
 
to
 
establish
 
concept
 
being
 
measured,
 
the
 
other
 
expert
 
was
 
seeking
 
to
 
ascertain
 
the
 
validity
 
of
 
the
 
tool
 
in
 
accurately
 
measuring
 
digitally
 
banking
 
channels
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
accurately
 
measuring
 
financial
 
inclusion.
 
These
 
experts
 
(reviewers)
 
surrendered
 
comments
 
on
 
the
 
statistical
 
validity
 
and
 
appropriateness
 
of
 
the
 
questions
 
to
 
the
 
research
 
experts.
 
 
The
 
present
 
study
 
conducted
 
reliability
 
tests
 
for
 
internal
 
consistency
 
to
 
obtain
 
Cronbach’s
 
alpha
 
(α)
 
coefficient.
 
The
 
data
 
for
 
reliability
 
testing
 
was
 
collected
 
from
 
18
 
outlets
 
of
 
commercial
 
banks
 
operating
 
Narok
 
County,
 
a
 
neighboring
 
county.

the
 
it
 
was
 
deduced
 
that

Since 
the
 
instrument
 
was
 
found
 
to
 
be
 
highly
 
consistent,
 
the
 
research
 
retained
 
all

Financial
 
inclusion 
among

County 
CBs
 
 
In
 
advance
 
the
 
research
 
assessed
 
the
 
financial
 
inclusion
 
among
 
CBs
 
in
 
Kajiado
 
county
 
to
 
establish
 
the
 
level.
 
After
 
this
 
analysis,
 
the
 
study
 
returned
 
the
 
contents
 
in
 
Table
 
3.
 
 
The results show that they disagreed to the 
assertion that the ratio of the bank account to the 
population of adults in the area is very high (M= 
2.21; SD
 
= 1.31) implying it was not exceeding 
75% as they also disagreed to the sentiment that 
all the bank a
ccount in their bank were 
active 
(
M= 2.09;
 
SD = 0.84). Further, they disagreed to 
the claim that the all customers were always able 
to access their accounts using digital banking 
services (M= 2.34; SD = 1.07) and again 
disagreed to the proposition that all
 
bank 
accounts actively access digital banking services 
(M= 2.47; SD = 1.15). While they disagreed to 
the proclamation that There is very high bank 
usage by their customers (M= 2.38; SD = 1.09), 
they disagreed to the assertion that the 
customers easily ada
pted to their digital banking 
services (M= 2.39; SD = 0.86). Overall financial 
inclusion among commercial banks in Kajiado 
county was shown to be low (M= 2.31; SD = 
1.05). Accordingly, there was low financial 
inclusion among commercial banks in Kajiado 
cou
nty agreeing to CBK (2016) financial services 
access is limited and accessibility to financial 
services has been a problem in Kenya where in 
Kajiado County. The low financial inclusion was 
informed by; low ratio of the bank account to the 
population of adu
lts in the area, significant 
inactive bank 
account,
 
customers inability able to 
access their accounts using digital banking 
services,
 
bank accounts not actively accessing 
digital banking services, low bank usage by their 
customers and customer note easily 
adapting to 
their digital banking services. Since majority of 
the residents have been derived accessibility to 
appropriate financial services, household poverty 
in the county has been propagated and hence 
strangling the county’s economic growth.

Inferential

The
 
study
 
tested
 
the
 
goodness
 
of

of
 
the
 
model
 
using
 
ANOVA
 
with
 
Table

holding
 
the
 
results
.
 
 
So as to effectively interpret this table, the 
research used the beta value; coefficient of X

, 
X

and X

, in equation (i
) where the study 
suggested that on one side, they are are all zero 
to signal β

=β
4 
= 0. Alternatively, it might 
be that at least one of the betas is 0 and to mean 
β

≠ 0. The research then went ahead to check 
satisfaction of either occurrences at 5
% level of 
significance. Notably, β

true and then accepted when the p

value 
exceeds 0.05 (p >.05)> when this happens, the it 
is accepted and assumption β
i
 
≠ 0 accordingly 
rejected. In case p

value 
≤0.05) then the 
assumption β
i
 
≠ 0 is
 
true and then accepted to 
the detriment of rejecting proposal β

2
= β

=β
4 
= 0. In our case, using (p
-
value = 0.000, F = 
24.012), it can be observed that p
-
value < 0.05 to 
mean accepting the assumption β
i
 
≠ 0 and 
rejecting β
1
=β
2
= β
3
=β
4 
= 0. Accepting assu
mption 
β
i
 
≠ 0 provides evidence that at least one of the 
betas 0 and this consequently means that at 
α=0.05, there is sufficient evidence that at least 
one of the IVs; digital channel, digital financial, 
convenience of digital financial services, digital 
s
ervice offering. Can reliably estimate financial 
inclusion among commercial banks in Kajiado 
county and accordingly, the respective estimated 
model reliably explains financial inclusion among 
commercial banks in Kajiado county in terms of; 
digital channel,
 
digital financial, convenience of 
digital financial services, digital service offering.
 
 
The associated regression results obtain during 
this exercise is shown in Table 9.
 
 
Using Table 9, an estimation model was 
construed from the beta values and guided b
y 
equation, obtaining equation (ii) linear regression 
mode; 
 
 
Ŷ = 0.389 + 0.171X
1
 
+ 0.161X
2
 
+ 0.353X
3
 
+ 
0.140X

………………….. 
(ii)
 
 
This is actually implies
 
that
;
 
 
Financial inclusion among CBs in Kajiado (
Ŷ) = 
0.389cons + 0.171 digital channel strategy (X1) +
 
0.161 digital financial infrastructure (X2) + 0.353 
convenience of digital financial services (X3) + 
0.141 digital service offering (X3)
……………
 
(iii)
 
 
Thus, 
financial
 
inclusion among CBs in Kajiado 
increases by 0.389 units 
regardless of whether 
the digital 
banking strategy indicators are active 
or not. The estimated model further exposes the 
effect the exploratory variables of digital banking 
strategy on the financial inclusion among CBs in 
Kajiado. Starting from the first a unit (1) change 
in the digital ch
annel strategy (X1) leads to a 
0.171 rate of increase in the financial inclusion 
among CBs in Kajiado and vice versa. When 
digital financial infrastructure (X2) increases with 
one
-
unit, financial inclusion among CBs in 
Kajiado increases at a rate of 0.161 
and when 
digital financial infrastructure (X2) decreases with 
one
-
unit
, financial inclusion among CBs in 
Kajiado decreases at a rate of 0.161. Meanwhile, 
one unit increase in 
convenience of digital 
financial services 
(X3) causes a rate of increase 
of 0.353
 
in financial inclusion among CBs in 
Kajiado and vice versa. When digital service 
offering (X4) increases by 
one
-
unit
, financial 
inclusion among CBs in Kajiado increases at a 
rate of 0.140 and when digital service offering 
(X4) decreases by 
one
-
unit
, finan
cial inclusion 
among CBs in Kajiado decreases at a rate of 
0.140.
