1 In this paper, a transaction account, which includes e-money, is held with banks or other authorized and/or regulated payment services providers and 
can be used to make and receive payments and store value. It is considered an essential financial service in its own right (CPMI and World Bank 2016). 
The World Bank’s Global Findex shows that 21 percent of adults in Sub-Saharan Africa have a mobile money account (a type of e-money), half of 
which do not have any other account. In 10 Sub-Saharan African countries, more adults have a mobile money account than a bank account. In Haiti, 
the share of adults with a mobile money account rose from 4 percent in 2014 to 14 percent in 2017 (Demirgüç-Kunt et al. 2018).Creating special licensing categories to allow newcomers 
to specialize in niches of the financial sector is not a new 
regulatory approach to advancing policy goals. Examples 
of this include special licenses for leasing and factoring 
companies, microfinance banks, limited-purpose banks, 
and financial cooperatives—all of which exist in many 
countries. Typically, the objective is to address market 
failures, such as inefficiency, concentration, lack of 
innovation, and shortage of services to certain demographics 
or geographies, while supporting policy objectives, such as 
competition, inclusion, and stability.
A special licensing category for nonbank e-money issuers 
(EMIs) is considered a key regulatory enabler for inclusive 
digital financial services (Staschen and Meagher 2018). 
A growing body of evidence attests to the value of EMIs 
in fostering inclusion by providing access to transaction 
accounts.1 However, not all regulators in emerging markets 
and developing economies (EMDEs) are open to or are 
able to create a special licensing category for EMIs, even 
if financial inclusion is a policy priority. The reasons for 
this range from legal challenges, to political resistance, to 
risk aversion. At least three EMDEs (India, Mexico, and 
Nigeria) have created an alternative: the payments bank 
license. And there is growing interest in special licensing 
categories among other EMDEs.
This Technical Note compares the EMI licensing category 
with the payments bank license. Whereas EMIs are 
nonbanks, a payments bank is a licensed bank that cannot 
provide credit services and engage in other activities that 
are typically permitted in a full banking license. They 
must dedicate their operations to payments and fund-
storage services.
The EMI license has been available in many developed 
economies and EMDEs for many years. Payments banks, 
on the other hand, are fairly new to the financial sector, 
and they exist in just a few countries. Despite this limited 
experience, it is possible to identify key differences between the two licensing categories, from both the regulatory and 
implementation perspectives. 
A key takeaway is that both licensing categories present 
practical and technical challenges that vary depending on 
the country context. Regardless of the licensing category, it 
is essential to adopt regulatory and supervisory frameworks 
that are proportionate to the limited risks inherent to 
the niche business of EMIs and payments banks. The 
experience so far indicates that it is difficult to achieve such 
proportionality—more so in the case of payments banks 
than EMIs.
For instance, it may be challenging to alter an intricate 
banking regulatory framework to fit the profile of payments 
banks. Payments banks should be exempt from certain rules 
designed for conventional banks, and supervisory practices 
need to be adapted as well. 
The EMI licensing category, on the other hand, allows 
regulators to start from scratch and set up a new, 
specialized, dedicated regulatory and supervisory 
framework. This obviates the need to address the difficulties 
inherent in adapting the banking framework, and it could 
be a more effective and efficient use of limited resources 
of financial authorities. While this could explain why so 
many jurisdictions have opted for the EMI license category, 
anecdotal evidence indicates that supervisors can still face 
challenges when it comes to applying proportionality to the 
implementation of EMI regulations.
This Note analyzes the EMI and the payments bank 
licensing categories and describes the contexts in which the 
latter was created in India, Mexico, and Nigeria. The Annex 
provides greater detail on the licensing categories in these 
three countries.2
NONBANK E-MONEY ISSUERS VS. PAYMENTS BANKS1  Why Create Special  
Licensing Categories?
Financial authorities give permission for financial 
institutions to operate by issuing licenses. The licenses 
should clearly describe the activities the institutions can 
engage in and identify which regulatory and supervisory 
framework will apply.2 All licensing categories are anchored 
in a foundational law. For instance, banks are usually 
licensed based on the banking law or similar, and payments 
institutions are licensed based on the payments law. In some 
jurisdictions, issuing licenses are based on other laws, such 
as the central bank law. 
Regulators can address the needs of new competitors 
and business models by creating new licensing categories 
with entry and ongoing requirements that vary according 
to different scopes of operation—the array of permitted 
activities—and that are proportionate to limited risks 
associated with these niche businesses. An adequate mix 
of carefully crafted licensing categories can help advance 
policy objectives such as competition, stability, financial 
inclusion, consumer protection, and integrity. Also, a 
“proportionate approach to licensing (e.g., less stringent 
licensing criteria and procedures for institutions with a 
low risk profile) allows authorities to allocate the level 
of resources appropriate for the range of activities that 
financial institutions are permitted to carry out and the risk 
posed to the financial system or depositors.”3
Among licensing categories that include collection and 
storage of funds from the public, conventional banks are 
permitted to engage in the broadest range of activities.4 
2 Fundamentally, financial regulation and supervision need to be clear as to permissible activities and licensing criteria. For banking activities, this require -
ment is part of the Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision, see BCBS (2012, p. 25–27).
3 See BCBS (2016, p. 10). In addition to specialized licensing categories, there are other approaches for proportionate licensing. For instance, regulators 
are increasingly using innovation facilitators such as regulatory sandboxes and innovation hubs. See Jenik, Duff, and de Montfort (2019).
4 “Conventional banks” and “full banking license” in this Note refer to the licensing category for banks that permits the broadest range of activities, 
including taking deposits from the general public and providing credit. These banks have different names in country regulations, such as commercial 
banks, multiple banks, universal banks, deposit money banks, and others. BCBS’s Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision (2012) uses the 
term “commercial banks”. 
5 BCBS (2015) describes the range of practice in the regulation and supervision of institutions relevant to financial inclusion and focuses on whether 
different approaches are necessary. One aspect surveyed is differentiated licensing criteria, including a graduated set of criteria.
6 EMDEs include, e.g., Afghanistan, Brazil, El Salvador, Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, Malawi, Mexico, Myanmar, Namibia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Paraguay, 
Peru, the Philippines, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda. Advanced economies include, e.g., Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, and members of the Eu -
ropean Union. EMIs may be called other names, including electronic money institution (Afghanistan), electronic money operator (Russia), store-value 
facilities (Australia), mobile money operator (Nigeria), mobile money service provider (Uganda), mobile financial services provider (Myanmar), mobile 
financial payment service provider (Malawi), and electronic payment funds institution (Mexico).Hence, they are a complex institutional type with risks 
that require stringent regulation and supervision. But not 
all institutions need to be so complex, and they should 
not face the same requirements of a full banking license. 
The unpacking of banking activities in different licensing 
categories allows for specialized ranges of permitted 
activities with lighter requirements. For instance, financial 
cooperatives in many countries fall into special licensing 
categories that have a lighter set of requirements compared 
to those of conventional banks. Other countries have created 
tiers within one licensing category (e.g., deposit-taking 
microfinance institutions), with the weight of requirements 
growing with the size and scope of operations.5
2 The EMI Licensing Category
Creating a special licensing category for EMIs is a key 
regulatory enabler for inclusive digital financial services 
(Staschen and Meagher 2018). Many EMDEs as well as 
advanced economies have created an EMI licensing category.6
Basically, the EMI license covers two common functions 
of conventional banks: (i) payments and (ii) value storage 
of funds collected from the public. The license limits 
EMIs to performing only services related to these two 
functions, namely, offering stored-value accounts called 
e-money accounts and payment services such as transfers, 
withdrawals, merchant payments, and bill payments. 3PROS
This licensing category is meant to clearly delineate the 
scope of EMI operations as being narrower than the more 
complex operations of a conventional bank. At the same 
time, it acknowledges that EMI operations are more 
complex than the more limited scope of activities of other 
payments services providers that do not offer value storage, 
such as money transfer operators, card schemes, and 
payment initiation services providers. 
Thus, EMIs fall in a licensing category of institutions that 
can carry out only a specific set of relatively simple and low-
risk activities. For instance, although EMIs collect funds 
from the public, they cannot intermediate them by offering 
credit, so they do not carry credit risk.7 As a result, although 
EMIs, like conventional banks, are subject to licensing 
criteria such as minimum initial capital, fit-and-proper 
requirements, and governance standards, the specifics of 
such criteria typically amount to lighter requirements. For 
instance, the minimum initial capital for EMIs is usually 
much lower than for conventional banks. Adaptation of 
licensing criteria to the lower risk of EMIs varies across 
jurisdictions. Some licensing criteria are listed in the Annex.8
A separate category of regulated institution is created to 
reflect a specific and proportionate regulatory framework for 
ongoing operating requirements for EMIs, commensurate 
with their risks. This includes fund safeguarding rules 
that aim to ensure that enough funds are set aside to meet 
customer demands. For example, many jurisdictions require 
EMIs to back up the total value owed to customers with safe 
and liquid assets that are kept in separate accounts—that 
is, not comingled with other EMI assets. EMIs may also be 
required to hold such assets in special accounts that have 
protective legal features, such as trust accounts, in order to 
shield the assets against claims from EMI creditors other 
than the EMI customers.9 
Together with the narrow range of permitted activities, 
these and other regulatory limitations reduce the risk 
of EMIs, allowing for a simpler supervisory framework 
7 Although they are not able to lend or offer other financial services, EMIs are usually allowed to partner with lenders, insurers, and other financial insti -
tutions to distribute their services. This presents new business and revenue opportunities for EMIs.
8 Staschen and Meagher (2018) delve into the main aspects of an EMI licensing category.
9 Kerse and Staschen (2018) detail the rules for EMIs to safeguard customer funds.
10 Dias and Staschen (2018) provide guidance on key areas of EMI supervision.than that of conventional banks.10 At the same time, they 
give room for competition from new players who would 
otherwise shy away from a conventional banking license 
and all the compliance costs that come with it. As a result, 
the dedicated EMI framework can offer a high level of 
regulatory certainty for market players, which could more 
easily support private-sector interest and investment. A 
dedicated framework may also facilitate future regulatory 
changes needed as the EMI industry develops.
CONS
An EMI license can be issued under different laws: 
• The banking law, as in Myanmar. 
• The payments law, as in most jurisdictions, including in the 
European Union. 
• Another law, for example, the fintech law in Mexico, 
financial inclusion laws in Colombia and El Salvador, 
e-money law in Peru, and the central bank law in Nigeria. 
The flexibility of the parent law affects the ability to create a 
dedicated specialized framework. The EMI licensing category 
has often developed into a fully customized set of rules, but 
this is not always the case. In addition, the creation of an 
EMI licensing category may require legal reform, which can 
be difficult and time consuming to achieve.
Furthermore, as nonbanks, the funds EMIs collect from 
customers are often ineligible for deposit insurance coverage 
(Izaguirre, Dias, and Kerse 2019). However, some countries 
have extended such coverage to the float backing the 
funds collected by EMIs. Examples of this can be found 
in Jamaica, Kenya, Nigeria, Rwanda, and the United 
States. EMIs may also be prohibited from distributing 
interest to their clients, such as in the European Union, 
Brazil, Paraguay, and Peru, However, distribution of 
interest is permitted or required in some countries, such as 
Bangladesh, Ghana, Myanmar, and Tanzania.4
NONBANK E-MONEY ISSUERS VS. PAYMENTS BANKSStrict fund safeguarding rules are a cornerstone of EMI 
regulations and are intended to provide a high level of 
ongoing protection to EMI customers. However, not all 
EMI frameworks provide such protection. For instance, 
when the safeguarded funds can be invested in risky assets, 
customer funds may be at risk.11 Moreover, some regulations 
do not require the use of special accounts with protective 
features such as trusts, leaving the funds potentially 
unprotected from claims by EMI creditors. Even when 
such special accounts are required, there could be legal and 
operational challenges to their effective use (Izaguirre, Dias, 
and Kerse 2019).
Another risk is the imposition of excessive requirements on 
EMIs. In many cases, this is because of the lack of detailed 
subordinate regulation and a tendency to apply standards 
designed for conventional banks to EMIs. Anecdotal evidence 
indicates that authorities in some EMDEs have imposed 
disproportional requirements on EMIs either during licensing 
or through the course of supervision. These may include the 
establishment of board committees and other governance and 
organizational structures that are required for conventional 
banks. The risk is accentuated when the staff assigned to 
EMI licensing and supervision do not have deep knowledge 
about the EMI business, supervisory experience, or internal 
support to adapt specific regulatory requirements. Finally, as 
a relatively new type of regulated institution globally, EMIs 
typically lack an internationally accepted framework for their 
recovery and resolution.
3  The Payments Bank  
Licensing Category
A special licensing framework for payments banks exists in 
at least three EMDEs: India, Mexico (referred to as payment 
niche banks), and Nigeria (referred to as payment services 
banks). In all three countries, payments banks are banks 
licensed under the banking law,12 but they cannot engage 
11 E.g., in the West Africa Economic and Monetary Union, EMIs can invest part of their e-money liabilities in corporate securities.
12 Banking Regulation Act, 1949, in India; Credit Institutions Law, 1990, in Mexico; Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act, 1991, in Nigeria.
13 “Digital banks” is a term that may be confused with “payments banks” as defined in this paper. However, the two have little in common. Digital banks are 
usually fully fledged banks licensed under the banking law that focus on digital financial services and channels by leveraging technology. They may be called 
online banks, virtual banks, smart banks, digital-only banks, and challenger banks. In most countries, digital banks do not require a special license category 
(exceptions include Hong Kong and Singapore).in the full range of banking activities. They must specialize 
in basic deposits and payments services, which makes their 
business very similar to the EMI business, except that they 
are licensed as banks.13 In that sense, this regime does not 
create a new type of regulated entity, but a type of limited-
purpose bank. There are five payments banks in India (of 
which one is under liquidation), one in Mexico, and none yet 
in Nigeria, as the first approvals-in-principle were awarded 
only in September 2019 (Proshare  2019).
PROS
Sometimes, creating an EMI licensing category is not 
feasible because of limitations in the existing legal system. 
Some banking laws have encompassing definitions 
of “banking business”, “deposit taking”, or “deposit”. 
This makes it nearly impossible for nonbanks to collect 
redeemable funds from the public, even if they are not 
intermediating the funds through lending. In some cases, 
reform of the banking law would be required. In other 
cases, reform of the banking law may not be needed 
because the definitions are more flexible, but regulators or 
politicians—or both—may not want nonbanks to collect 
and store client funds and may oppose the EMI licensing 
category. The payments bank license can be a solution in 
any of these cases. 
The accounts of payments bank customers are classified 
as bank deposits under banking law, rather than e-money 
accounts. As such, they are likely to be covered under the 
deposit insurance system (if there is one). Another potential 
advantage is that as banks, payments banks may have access 
to central bank services, such as settlement accounts and 
liquidity facilities, and the interbank markets that help 
them to manage liquidity needs. They may also be included 
in the recovery and resolution frameworks created for 
conventional banks. 5Like EMIs, payments banks are prohibited from lending.14 
However, while most regulations prohibit EMIs from 
paying interest on e-money accounts, payments banks can 
offer interest-bearing accounts, which might help them 
attract customers. 
CONS
The payments bank license also has disadvantages. The 
main challenge seems to be adapting banking regulations 
and supervisory practices to the risk profile of payments 
banks, including setting specialized licensing criteria 
and ongoing operating requirements. The existing 
bank regulations may automatically apply unless there 
is an explicit exemption, even though they may be too 
burdensome for the limited scope of payments banks. Full 
customization is necessary but depending on the level of 
detail included in the banking law, it may require changing 
the banking law itself. 
Even if a legal reform is not needed and proportional 
requirements could be specified on the level of subordinate 
regulation, the bank regulator or supervisor may be 
unwilling or unable to adapt the regulations and the 
supervisory approach—payments banks are still banks, 
after all. As in the case of EMIs, a lack of technical 
knowledge about the payments bank business or a lack of 
internal support for customizing requirements may be the 
cause of a disproportional approach.
Also, it can be challenging to craft a proportionate 
specialized framework for payments banks out of existing 
banking regulations. Regulation and supervision designed 
for banks can form undue obstacles for payments banks, 
particularly for newcomers. 
In terms of recovery and resolution, it is not yet clear 
whether conventional bank frameworks would be 
appropriate for payments banks. Given the much lower level 
of complexity of payments banks, customized frameworks 
may still be needed. The liquidation of Aditya Birla 
Idea Payments Bank will be the first case of liquidating 
a payments bank and will provide some early insights 
(Economic Times 2019).
14 Like EMIs, payments banks may distribute credit and other services (e.g., insurance) on behalf of another financial services provider.Another potential issue concerns fund safeguarding 
requirements. These are typical of EMI regulations, and in 
principle, they should apply to payments banks. However, 
payments banks may not be subject to the full array of 
fund safeguarding rules. For instance, the regulation may 
not impose restrictions on how payments banks handle the 
funds owed to customers (other than the prohibition to 
lend them out). Without such rules, payments banks may 
comingle customer funds with their own or invest the funds 
in risky or illiquid assets. The fact that payments banks 
may have access to bank deposit insurance coverage does 
not eliminate the need for fund safeguarding rules because 
these measures serve different purposes.
4 Country Cases
So far, India, Mexico, and Nigeria are the only EMDEs 
that have a payments bank licensing category, as it is 
defined in this Note. Mexico and Nigeria also have an EMI 
licensing category, while India has a licensing category 
for an institution similar to EMIs, but subject to more 
restrictions. The different country contexts are summarized 
below. Greater detail on the regulatory requirements for 
each country is in the Annex.
4.1 INDI A
In 2009, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) created, under 
the Payment Systems Act, a special licensing category 
similar to EMIs, called Prepaid Payment Instrument (PPI) 
issuer. The intent was to make room for nonbanks to 
conduct e-money business. Due to restrictive definitions 
in (or interpretations of) the banking law, the regulation 
does not allow nonbank PPI issuers to operate “open 
system PPIs.” This means that their customers cannot 
cash out funds from PPI accounts. Only banks can 
operate open system PPIs that offer cash withdrawals. This 
restriction, alongside a monthly deposit limit of US$700 
(INR 50,000), prohibition of interest payment, constantly 
shifting customer due diligence (CDD) rules, and a recent 
increase of the minimum capital (defined as net worth) 6
NONBANK E-MONEY ISSUERS VS. PAYMENTS BANKSfor existing and new nonbank PPI issuers, has challenged 
their viability.15
In 2014, RBI created a special licensing category for 
payments banks under the Banking Regulation Act. 
This is in response to a strategic review of the banking 
sector that highlighted the need for niche banking and 
pointed to differentiated licensing as a desirable step.16 
Payments banks are similar to EMIs in the activities they 
undertake, except that they are banks. As banks, they 
can offer interest-bearing current/savings accounts that 
may be covered by deposit insurance. Unlike customers 
of PPI issuers, customers of payments banks can cash out 
their funds, but their accounts are subject to a maximum 
balance of US$1,400 (INR 100,000).17 When compared to 
nonbank PPI issuers, payments banks are subject to stricter 
rules, such as:
• Capital requirements (higher minimum initial capital and a 
capital adequacy ratio of 15 percent).18 
• A leverage ratio of 3 percent.
• A cash reserve ratio for outside demand and time liabilities. 
• A statutory liquidity ratio of 75 percent on demand deposit 
liabilities. 
• Minimum board structure.
• A minimum of 25 percent of physical access points in rural 
areas. 
Despite the limited scope of permitted activities, payments 
banks are subject to most of the existing banking 
regulations, while benefiting from a minimum initial capital 
15 In late 2017, RBI increased the minimum required net worth of nonbank PPI issuers from INR 10 million (US$140,000) to INR 150 million (US$2.1 
million). Compliance was required within three years from licensing for nonbank PPI issuers licensed after the issuance of the new regulation or by 
2020 for nonbank PPI issuers already operating when the new regulation was issued. PPI issuers were first allowed to follow simplified CDD proce -
dures, but in late 2017 they were required to reregister all clients using full CDD procedures. 
16 The review is reflected in RBI (2013a and 2013b), which examined the issues relevant to a ubiquitous payments network and universal access to savings. 
In a 2014 speech, India’s Finance Minister noted that “differentiated banks serving niche interests, local area banks, payment banks etc. are contemplat -
ed to meet credit and remittance needs of small businesses, unorganized sector, low income households, farmers and migrant work force” (Jaitley 2014).
17 Some payments banks have worked around this limit by partnering with conventional banks to make automatic transfers of the excess amounts to fixed-
term deposits with the partner bank.
18 The minimum paid-up equity capital for payments banks is INR 1 billion (US$14 million).
19 The minimum paid-up capital for conventional banks is INR 5 billion (US$70 million).
20 For details on UPI, see Cook and Raman (2019). 
21 E.g., in August 2018, RBI prohibited Paytm from enrolling new customers due to weaknesses in CDD controls and data security, it required Paytm’s CEO 
to step down for not having a banking background, and it required the company’s head office to split from that of its parent company. Previously, RBI had 
temporarily prohibited two other payments banks, Airtel and Fino, to acquire new customers because of compliance issues related to CDD rules.
22 The Aadhaar and Other Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019, https://uidai.gov.in/images/news/Amendment_Act_2019.pdf .five times lower than that for conventional banks (RBI 
2013b, p. 76).19 RBI had expected that nonbank PPI issuers 
would apply for payments banks licenses (Paytm, the largest 
payments bank, is a converted PPI issuer). Nonbank PPI 
issuers used to lack access to the national payments system, 
but have since been allowed to connect to the Unified 
Payments Interface (UPI).20 This has made the upgrade of 
nonbank PPI issuers to payments banks, with their heavier 
regulatory costs, less attractive. Also, payments banks have 
faced strict RBI measures.21
The uncertainty around the legality of using Aadhaar, the 
government-issued ID, for CDD purposes has also affected 
PPI issuers and payments banks. A September 2018 Supreme 
Court verdict had created some ambiguity about the private 
sector’s use of Aadhaar for CDD. This led institutions to shift 
from digital CDD procedures to costly manual procedures. 
After a period of uncertainty, the Aadhaar and Other Laws 
(Amendment) Act, 2019, was passed by Parliament in July 
2019 to allow the use of Aadhaar for customer authentication 
(although customers cannot be compelled to use their 
Aadhaar for this purpose).22
Payments banks and PPI issuers have also struggled to 
provide value in India’s specific context. The massive account 
opening effort led by the government through Pradhan 
Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (known as PMJDY) since 2014 
has resulted in nearly all households in the country having 
access to an account. These accounts are mostly provided by 
government banks, leading to fewer opportunities for others 
to serve unbanked customers. However, payments banks and 
nonbank PPI issuers might still have a comparative advantage 7over conventional banks in serving more remote and poorer 
segments of the population. 
Also, big tech companies (Google, Amazon, Facebook/
Whatsapp) have entered the India market, bringing 
competition but avoiding the regulatory costs (since they 
partner with licensed conventional banks). In this context, 
and considering the regulatory burden imposed on them, 
PPI issuers and payments banks do not have a clear future. 
Out of the 11 payments bank licenses issued, only five were 
operating as of July 2019. One of the five closed down by 
October 2019 (Moneylife 2019), while two have announced 
reaching profitability. RBI has retracted its policy of not 
allowing payments banks to apply for a license to be a small 
finance bank, which is permitted to lend (RBI 2019). This 
shift has been interpreted as an attempt to boost payments 
bank profitability (Gopakumar 2019).
4.2 MEXICO
Since 2009, Mexico has passed reforms to increase 
competition and promote financial inclusion. From the 
start, it recognized the potential role of EMIs. Despite this, 
an early attempt to create a licensing category for EMIs was 
strongly opposed by a range of stakeholders who followed a 
strict interpretation of the banking law. Also, some feared 
that the financial sector would become as concentrated as 
the telecom sector if mobile network operators (MNOs) 
were allowed to own EMIs. 
For these reasons, a reform of the banking law in 2012 
introduced a new category of “niche banks,” including 
payments niche banks, instead of a special licensing 
category for EMIs. Some expected payments niche banks to 
be as successful as EMIs had been in some other countries, 
but the expectation has not been met. There is only one 
payments niche bank in Mexico, and it does not provide 
services to retail customers. A major reason this model 
failed is because prudential regulation was not adapted to 
account for the limited scope of activities, which resulted 
in excessive regulatory costs.23 For instance, payments 
23 Discussions with industry experts. See also Skelton (2013). 
24 Only 36.9 percent of Mexican adults had an account in 2017 (Demirgüç-Kunt et al. 2018).
25 In 2017, 39.7 percent of adults had an account whereas, in 2014, 44.4 percent had an account (Demirgüç-Kunt et al. 2018).
26 Other requirements may include, e.g., a minimum of 25 percent of touch points in rural areas, a required cash reserve, risk-weighted capital adequacy 
ratio, and a minimum of 75 percent of customer liabilities invested in government bonds.niche banks have been subject to the same capital adequacy 
requirements applied to conventional banks, as well as to 
the same reporting requirements.
Low uptake of these banks and limited progress in financial 
inclusion prompted Mexican authorities to finally create a 
licensing category for EMIs in the 2018 fintech law. 24 Unlike 
most EMI frameworks, the newly created instituciones de 
fondos de pago electrónico  (IFPEs [Spanish for “electronic 
payments funds institutions”) can receive cash deposits only 
if the banking authority gives them a separate authorization. 
Given this and other strict rules embedded in the fintech law 
and implementing regulation, it remains to be seen whether 
IFPEs will be able to advance financial inclusion. 
4.3 NIGERIA
In Nigeria, a licensing category for an EMI, referred to 
as mobile money operator (MMO), was created in 2009. 
While the regulation generally follows the international 
practice for EMIs’ permitted activities and requirements, 
it does not permit MNOs to own MMOs. Although 15 
nonbanks hold an MMO license Nigeria has fallen behind 
in expanding financial inclusion.25 One reason for the slow 
progress may be the absence of MNOs in the market. In 
countries such as Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, and Tanzania, 
MNOs leverage their extensive agent networks to support 
their EMI businesses. To correct this, the Central Bank of 
Nigeria created an additional licensing category for payment 
services banks in October 2018. 
A payment services bank is similar to an MMO, except 
that, because it is a bank, funds collected from customers 
are classified as bank deposits and covered by deposit 
insurance. Nigeria’s payment services bank regulations are 
very similar to those in India. The minimum initial capital 
is high at US$13.5 million (NGN 5 billion) compared 
to that of MMOs at US$5.5 million (NGN 2 billion). 
The high minimums together with other requirements 
impose high costs, which limit new entrants to large 
players such as MNOs.26 As opposed to the MMO license, 8
NONBANK E-MONEY ISSUERS VS. PAYMENTS BANKSthis one allows MNOs to enter the e-money business. 
These two licensing categories for MMOs and payment 
services banks mean that they provide the same type of 
service. This may lead to regulation and supervision issues 
regarding level playing fields. It remains to be seen how 
payment services banks will affect the financial inclusion 
landscape in Nigeria, as the Central Bank has to date 
only issued three approvals-in-principle and none of the 
providers has fully launched its operations.27
5 Conclusion
Creating special licensing categories for newcomers 
to pursue a limited set of regulated activities in the 
financial sector is one strategy to advance policy goals, 
such as financial inclusion, competition, and efficiency. 
More specifically, a licensing category for EMIs is a key 
regulatory enabler for inclusive digital financial services. 
The EMI licensing category allows for the creation of a 
fully tailored regulatory and supervisory framework that 
is aligned with the risks of the EMI business. As such, it 
imposes proportional regulatory costs and provides a high 
level of certainty for EMIs. There is also significant global 
experience with EMI regulation. Potential weaknesses 
are that it may require legal reforms, prohibit payment 
of interest to e-money customers, face resistance from 
stakeholders, and exclude the funds collected by EMIs from 
deposit insurance coverage.
India, Mexico, and Nigeria have an additional licensing 
category called the payments bank license. In these cases, 
the permitted activities of payments banks are similar to 
those of EMIs. Like the EMI license, the payments bank 
license presents inherent advantages and disadvantages. 
27 The approval in principle is the first stage of the licensing process, after which the applicant must set up the business and, within six months, apply for a 
full license to start commercial operations. The main advantage of payments banks is that they are 
allowed to provide interest-bearing current and savings 
accounts that are likely to be covered by deposit insurance. 
However, as banks, payments banks are immediately subject 
to the full range of banking regulations and supervisory 
practices that apply to conventional banks unless regulators 
tailor regulation and supervision to their specific risk profile. 
The experience with payments banks is still limited, and 
the country contexts in which they have been created are 
unique and do not allow for drawing general conclusions at 
this point.
The central takeaway from the experience so far is that, 
regardless of the licensing category chosen, regulators and 
supervisors may find it difficult to break free from the 
conventional bank mindset. They will need to implement 
fully tailored regulatory frameworks and supervisory 
practices that are commensurate to the specific risk profile 
of EMIs or payments banks. Requiring EMIs and payments 
banks to comply with regulation intended for conventional 
banks leads to unduly high compliance costs that could 
prevent either type of institution from helping regulators 
achieve their stated policy goals. Balancing financial stability, 
inclusion, integrity, and other policy objectives remains a 
significant challenge. Overcoming this challenge must be a 
central concern when creating new licensing categories.9References
